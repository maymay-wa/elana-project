lyle menendez 22 was charged with two counts of murder in the 
deaths of jose menendez 45 and his wife mary louise kitty 
menendez 44 said deputy district attorney elden fox 
menendez 19yearold brother erik was named in the complaint 
and was being sought in israel on identical counts fox said 
police would not reveal a motive but ruled out earlier 
speculation that drugs or organized crime were involved police 
chief marvin iannone said physical evidence linked the aug 20 
killings to the sons whom he described as the triggermen 
i dont know if there was one motive or several iannone 
said as in any family there are a lot of conflicts who knows 
what really goes on in families 
the focus became very clear over the past few months that the 
sons did it iannone said we were just waiting for the glue 
binding it together 
he declined to elaborate on information that led to the arrests 
jose menendez was chairman of live entertainment inc a video 
and music distribution business affiliated with carolco pictures 
inc producers of the rambo movies 
under terms of the parents 9yearold wills the sons share a 
10 million estate they also were beneficiaries of a 400000 life 
insurance policy 
the complaint includes specialcircumstances allegations that 
make the sons eligible for the death penalty if convicted 
the couple were killed by multiple shotgun blasts at close 
range their sons who reported the killings said they found the 
bodies after a night out 
in the months after the killings lyle menendez traveled the 
country making investments and buying stores particularly 
fastfood franchises said iannone 
lyle menendez was arrested at 120 pm as he was preparing to 
drive away from the family mansion he had been under surveillance 
for the past 36 hours iannone said

tournament in israel police were seeking help from the state 
department the israeli government and interpol the international 
police organization 
at the time of the shootings nothing was stolen from the 
spanishstyle 5 million home there were no signs the killers 
forced their way in and reportedly no clues at the scene 
police said during the investigation that they were looking into 
the disappearance of a computerized record concerning menendezs 
plans to write a new will 
family members speaking four months after the slayings on 
condition of anonymity said a relative tried to read a computer 
file named will after the murders but was unable to do so 
before a computer expert was brought in the file disappeared 
the relatives would not say who might have erased the file 
iannone declined to comment in detail except to say the will 
was very much involved in our investigation 
the elder menendez had little money when his parents sent him 
from cuba after castro took power he was an executive for rca and 
hertz before joining live entertainment 
companies operated by live had been linked to organized crime 
and pornography before live bought them but company officials have 
rejected suggestions the deaths may have a mob link

journalists end up in deep trouble if 
they blur the line between fact and fiction but the writers at the 
american comedy network thrive on keeping people guessing about 
whats real and whats not 
take their recent spoof interview with the president when a 
george bush impersonator sought advice on finding a new enemy to 
replace the soviet union or when the presidents opinion on 
the summit at sea with mikhail gorbachev turned into a 
commentary on another superpower meeting the fight between sugar 
ray leonard and roberto duran 
since 1983 the american comedy network has been producing zany 
irreverent skits mock interviews and fake commercials that disc 
jockeys around the country use to boost the insanity level of their 
shows 
when you get up in the morning there are certain things you 
need whats the weather going to be like are the highways 
crowded said acn general manager and cofounder andy goodman 
and the other hidden ingredient is getting your day rolling and 
comedy is always good fare 
goodman and cofounder bob james were working at a radio station 
in orlando fla when newcity communications inc in bridgeport 
recruited them to produce parodies for its 11 radio stations 
five months later they hit it big with one of their mock 
commercials a parody of the atampt breakup called breakin up is 
hard on you sung to neil sedakas breakin up is hard to do 
it got so much airplay that a boston record company made it into a 
single that sold 200000 copies and broke into the top 80 on one of 
billboard magazines record charts 
within three years acn had 128 customers now it serves 274 
stations in the united states canada australia ireland new 
zealand and the us virgin islands 
acn has several competitors including rock comedy network the 
premier comedy network the country comedy network and the 
contemporary comedy network 
we started at the time when the need for comedy in radio was 
just beginning to build goodman said we were there to answer 
the call and then when everybody else jumped into the field we 
were considered the first and the best 
for 1800 to 15500 a year depending on market size radio 
stations get 10 tapes a week from acns staff of 18 plus 
freelancers 
nothing is sacred to the writers 
there was a commercial for choke cola for the denver broncos 
who have been whipped in their four super bowl appearances clients 
got a commercial for the james brown security alarm system soon 
after the godfather of souls arrest 
not everyone sees the fun in some of acns antics 
sears roebuck amp co sued over a spoof commercial for a white 
sale at fears department store in johannesburg south africa 
the nations largest retailer eventually settled for 1 in return 
for destruction of the tape 
when acn did a spot on infidelity bank it got a call from 
the chairman of the board of a fidelity bank in topeka kan who 
was afraid his customers were going to think the bank was saying 
they have sex with their customers goodman said 
some people just dont have a sense of humor goodman 
said thats one of the risks of doing something in comedy 
acn writers assemble every weekday and flip through such 
publications as people magazine usa today and the new york times 
taking the nations pulse and figuring out what will strike its 
funny bone 
their scripts wind up in the studio where acns ed kelly and 
new york comedian nancy park record most of the voices the 
finished product is dubbed onto tapes to be shipped federal express 
to acns affiliates 
the pressure to be funny week after week is enormous and four of 
the five original contributors have moved on to other careers 
goodman the last holdout also is thinking to go into television 
writing or journalism 
after seven years its hard because when you sit down to write 
your 1000th fake commercial or 500th song parody you cant say 
its as exciting as your first fake commercial goodman said 
weve done it for seven years so it just gets tough

legs are the talk of the town in milan this 
week as people try to cope with the shocking news that skirts will 
be shorter than ever next winter 
the general consensus is that toolong legs are almost as bad as 
too short but whatever the case knees must never be chubby 
this spells good news for diet experts and for workout centers 
and cosmetic companies which will undoubtedly be flooded with women 
trying to get rid of those knee dimples so cute when they were 
babies but now definitely outdated 
the most extreme version of the new fallwinter 19901991 
micromini seen at gianni versace played around the hip bone 
hardly a length for the office this came at the beginning of the 
fourday italian readytowear fashion week which closed here 
thursday 
slightly longer versions were presente by almost every designer 
showing this week with the exception of soprani ferre and armani 
who placed their hemlines a demure inch or so above the knee 
another novelty in the short hemline department is the 
introduction of sporty bermudas and short shorts into the winter 
wardrobe 
these outfits as well as the skirts are usually worn with 
ribbed wool tights or thighhigh boots 
the abbreviated hemline even creeps into fashionable night life 
with many elegant velvet and sequined gowns anything but 
floorlength 
for those who dont care for the micro look the over30 top 
italian designers showing their wares here this week revived the 
thin pencil pants in light fabric or wool jersey popular in the 
1950s 
there is a lot of sportswear in these latest collections with 
velour sweat suits knit body suits embroidered heavy knit 
sweaters and loads of fashionable parkas and duffel coats even 
jenny usually a safe address for the career woman showed lots of 
freetime outfits and afterhours hemlines 
to enoble its sporty thrust next years winter fashion uses a 
lot of gold detailing both for day and night 
the new shape is the aline which appears in dresses and 
jackets alike shoulders are narrower in general although there is 
no need to throw away your shoulder pads 
in the passamenterie department there is abundant use of silk 
cording wool braiding fringe and lace trimming 
the most used fabric of the season is velour which appears 
around the clock 
colors are either bright shades gleaned from a new england fall 
landscape or icy pastels drawn from the hues of a winter morning 
christmasbow red is the newest color although the traditional 
milan browns grays and blacks are still around they no longer 
dominate the collections 
following in alphabetical order are a few highlights from the 
shows

grants are godsends for writers like 
martha collins but she still had to think long and hard before 
accepting a 20000 fellowship this year from the national 
endowment for the arts 
the financial freedom was tempting but it came with a few 
strings attached collins and 96 other writers nationwide had to 
sign letters promising to comply with federal guidelines including 
congressional antiobscenity and antidrug restrictions 
i signed because i can live with it but im concerned by the 
tone concerned that things could get worse instead of better 
said collins who also directs the writing program at the 
university of massachusetts at boston 
many other artists are similarly troubled by the nea guidelines 
that were imposed by congress after the uproar last summer over 
exhibits of robert mapplethorpes homoerotic photography and andres 
serranos crucifix submerged in a jar of urine both of which were 
federally funded 
under the restrictions adopted as part of the nea appropriations 
bill signed into law last year by president bush the endowment 
agreed to weed out grant recipients whose art might be construed as 
obscene 
but nea chairman john frohnmayer said thursday he did not 
endorse the legislation though as a federal official he was 
prohibited from lobbying against it 
im obligated to obey the law he said in a telephone 
interview from washington i do think that the statute is 
unnecessary and i hope that congress in its wisdom will not see fit 
to continue it 
among the 1990 applicants five writers were singled out for 
closer examination and all of the more than 4000 artists who 
eventually were granted funds received a package containing the 
promissory letter the nea said 
like a lot of writers i was in a financially desperate 
situation so i signed but not without a lot of outrage said 
alison demming a provincetown poet the nea is giving us freedom 
from economic stress but theyre saying we cant exercise it 
freely 
thats not the perception the nea wants its writers to have 
said spokeswoman virginia falck 
our stand is dont let this intimidate you feel free to 
create as you wish she said when youre funding creativity 
youve got to allow room for people to do all kinds of things 
warts and all 
unless those warts include material deemed obscene or created 
under the influence of drugs 
grant recipients were asked to swear off art that included but 
was not limited to depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism 
the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex 
acts and which when taken as a whole do not have serious 
literary artistic political or scientific merit 
some writers felt they were staring down a potential pact with 
the devil opening the gates to increased censorship and state 
control of the arts 
its ironic that weve spent all these years reading about 
restrictions on artists in eastern europe and just when theyre 
gaining freedom were beginning to feel restricted collins said 
the cambridgebased poet also objected to sandwiching 
homoerotic art between images of sadomasochism and sexually 
exploited children everyone ive talked with feels its 
alarming she said 
other writers didnt take things quite so hard 
writer ursula hegi of spokane wash said she signed without 
hesitation because it was not in any conflict with what im 
doing 
mark richard a new york novelist said the devil may have been 
dangling the money before him but that didnt much diminish the 
temptation 
i would never let anything dictate my work ever but for 20 
grand id sign even if i were a heroin addict said richard who 
earned 7000 last year let them come after me for it 
the neas falck said the endowment has not so far developed a 
procedure for checking up on the thousands of photographers 
dancers urban designers painters and other artists who each year 
receive federal funds 
liam rector who directs the norfolk vabased associated 
writing programs said enforcing the restrictions could prove an 
administrative artcop nightmare 
but enforcing them through an artistic police state would be 
scarier he said 
thats why the writers coalition an umbrella for 50 member 
groups including pen america the modern language association and 
the national writers union plans to monitor closely the neas 
next steps 
the nea is supposed to be an arts advocate and at the same 
time must comply with this law rector said the endowment 
finds it difficult to defend itself so it falls to the field and to 
the artists themselves to protect first amendment rights

it took only 36 moves for anatoly 
karpov to defeat jan timman in the opening game of their world 
chess candidates final match 
thursdays game was the first in the 12game series with the 
winner being the first player to score 6 points the series is to 
run until april 8 
the winner of this match will meet garri kasparov in lyon 
france to decide the world championship 
the match caries a total prize of 150000 with the winner 
receiving 93750 and the loser the balance 
karpov of the soviet union handled the black side of the ruy 
lopez igor zaisetv variation with such ease that timman of the 
netherlands stopped the clock after 36 moves to avoid being 
checkmated with a queenbishop combination 
the game opened slowly with both players following a popular 
line in the spanish system karpov went into the above variation 
with bb7 and later introduced a novelty seven moves later 
according to a grandmaster present at the malaysia match timman 
missed a chance to equalize when he moved his queen to the g4 
square he could have taken the pawn on d5 but instead went for a 
bishop pair retention that proved to be insufficient compensation 
if the score is tied after 12 games two further games will be 
played if these fail to resolve the tie two more games will be 
played if this again fails to resolve the tie a series of 
suddendeath games at faster time limits will decide the match

when wealthy republican gubernatorial candidate 
william weld accused his chief rival of waging class warfare 
and using hate tactics the jokes began immediately 
about his upperclass accent lockjaw about his native new 
england foods boiled and his traditional dress docksiders 
no socks 
not that weld is incapable of joking about his white anglosaxon 
protestant pedigree himself asked recently about the last book he 
had read weld quipped with a smile candle making for fun and 
profit a reference he said to his yankee roots 
but weld was deadly serious wednesday when he called a news 
conference to warn house minority leader steven pierce the son of 
a carpenter to lay off his blueblood background 
i think its time to get this class issue out into the open 
and reveal it for what it is the oldstyle politics of hate and 
fear weld said 
pierce said weld was being a bit touchy on the subject 
i think bill is showing an incredible amount of sensitivity 
in a political campaign a lot of statements are made and things 
are hurled around pierce said 
weld 44 is a former us assistant attorney general who quit 
the reagan administration after questions were raised about his 
boss edwin meese ii he now lives in cambridge with his wife a 
member of the roosevelt clan and works at the proper boston law 
firm of hale amp dorr 
he has had memberships in exclusive clubs and has a stock 
portfolio worth between 850000 and 15 million he resigned from 
the clubs when he began eyeing the governors race 
a pierce supporter circulated a letter thursday around the 
statehouse suggesting the legislature pass a brahmin rights act 
republican rep william vernon said he wrote the letter to 
inject a little humor into the campaign his tongueincheek 
legislation would ensure the brahmins civil rights and equal 
access to housing employment and elective office the recent 
travails of bill weld offer ample evidence of the prejudices 
against those individuals known as yankee bluebloods he said 
in the letter 
in a state where a generation can still recall no irish need 
apply signs and where many remember that busing to accomplish 
racial integration bypassed rich white suburbanites and people who 
could afford to send their children to private schools weld may 
have tapped into a lingering bias 
todd domke a republican political consultant has said weld may 
be suffering from the last acceptable prejudice in the state 
against yankees 
another political observer marty linsky a former republican 
legislator who lectures at harvard universitys kennedy school of 
government pointed out the bias hasnt hurt yankees in the past 
for most of massachusetts history brahmins have been 
successful in leadership positions in public life because people 
trusted them linsky said brahmins in new england are cultured 
people from longestablished upperclass families 
paul watanabe head of the political science department at the 
university of massachusetts in boston said welds attack may help 
him 
i think weld is trying to turn what is presumably a liability 
into a strength watanabe said raising this particular issue 
is a good one i think his dealing with it straight on is good 
but former gov francis sargent who can trace his bloodlines to 
the puritans said weld would do better to leave the issue alone 
the more he says about it the more he draws attention to 
it sargent told the patriot ledger of quincy just tell them 
to spell the name right 
sargent used to talk up a different branch of his family my 
grandmother was italian and i peddled that all over the state 
where she came from in italy what her name was sargent said

vice president dan quayle leaving friday to 
help usher in new presidents in chile and brazil said his trip 
will also focus on economic development in latin america where we 
have not been as successful as wed like 
on the trip quayle also will press president bushs effort to 
win latin acceptance for the usinstalled government of panama 
even as both chile and brazil snub the panamanian president 
elevated by the us invasion 
panama was the only country in the hemisphere not invited to 
send representatives to sundays inauguration of chiles new 
president patricio aylwin and also is excluded from the march 15 
swearing in of brazils fernando collor de mello 
governments in those nations like other latin countries 
condemned bushs dec 20 military invasion as a violation of 
panamas sovereignty they had withdrawn their ambassadors from 
panama city to protest the rule of gen manuel antonio noriega but 
retained diplomatic relations with panama 
quayles weeklong trip also includes stops in venezuela 
barbados paraguay and argentina 
now that chile has become the last country in south america to 
hold democratic elections quayle said he will be listening to the 
economic needs of the debtand inflationplagued latin and 
caribbean leaders 
political development has been successful in the hemisphere 
but we have not been as successful as wed like on economic 
development quayle told reporters thursday on the eve of his 
departure 
i will be asking the leaders of the individual countries for 
their ideas on trade and economic ideas he said 
little progress has been made except in mexico on the bush 
administrations plan to help ease latin american debt in part 
through forgiveness of outstanding loans by commercial banks 
quayle said he had called prime minister michael manley of 
jamaica earlier thursday to inform him the administration would 
provide an additional 10 million in food assistance for the 
caribbean nation bringing the total to 44 million for that 
country 
quayle also will relay bushs plea for a common voice of support 
for both panama and the newly elected government of nicaragua 
the countries that have refused to recognize panamas president 
guillermo endara generally feel that panama should have an election 
or congressional mandate to legitimize his government 
were moving toward hemispheric wide acceptance of the 
panamanian government general acceptance these sorts of things 
will be worked out said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
endaras recent announcement that he would propose a series of 
reforms and submit them to the electorate for approval is a step in 
the direction that the other latin countries would like to see 
said a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
us officials said they are hopeful that diplomacy spurred in 
part by venezuelas president carlos andres perez will result in a 
more generous attitude toward the endara government 
in brazil it is likely that the new government will examine 
the matter in a new light said a brazilian diplomat 
quayles trip also offers a potentially interesting twist in 
chile with the expected attendance of nicaraguas outgoing 
president daniel ortega 
quayle and ortega are not scheduled to meet but in a reversal 
of past policy beckwith said were certainly not opposed to 
it 
the united states in a policy begun by president reagan 
refused to meet with nicaraguan officials us officials said 
managua should meet for direct talks with the usbacked contra 
rebels first 
that whole situation changed with the victory last month of 
violeta chamorro over ortega and the calls from all sides for the 
contras to give up their fight 
quayle will meet with the outgoing chilean president gen 
agosto pinochet who was forced to call an election 16 years after 
he ousted the elected government of salvador allende although 
aylwin won the election pinochet is insisting on retaining control 
of the 60000man chilean army 
quayle will be accompanied to chile by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass who engendered ire there by pushing the current us arms 
embargo on chile to protest pinochets human rights record 
when kennedy went to meet with opposition leaders in 1986 
pinochets police stood by while 200 rightist demonstrators threw 
rocks and eggs and blocked kennedys motorcade 
quayle will spend only a few hours in venezuela where 
antiamerican protests also are a possibility 
perez said his government would not recognize panama until us 
invasion troops were withdrawn and the endara government was given 
legitimacy by the electorate the troops were out by midfebruary 
although the united states still retains its preinvasion force of 
some 13000 in panama 
in brazil and argentina economic concerns are expected to be a 
big part of quayles talks

priests in ancient babylon faked an inscription to 
make their temple seem older a modern scottish museum had to fake 
a fish with fur to satisfy public demand 
these are among 600 objects in a british museum exhibition that 
displays 3000 years of the forgers art and suggests that fakes 
often reflect what people want to believe 
the objects range from a faked roman chariot and photographs of 
fairies to a forged rembrandt painting and a witchs wreath 
the exhibition fake the art of deception running through 
sept 2 contains fake jewels coins sculptures fossils 
furniture and porcelain 
theres even a letter purporting to have been written by jesus 
christ 
most of the worst errors in this exhibition are our own 
says director sir david m wilson 
its not surprising as we have been collecting for a long time 
as museums go nearly 250 years the forgers had more than a head 
start as they were busy in ancient babylon 3000 years ago he 
said 
wilson admits there is a horrid fascination about fakes 
although we sweep them under the carpet we talk about them all the 
time because we know we as experts are fallible 
the first thing visitors see is a supposed etruscan tomb of the 
6th century bc made about 120 years ago 
the british museum bought the tomb from an italian dealer in 
1871 because the louvre had one and we were jealous said dr 
susan walker an antiquities expert 
within a year of the purchase the inscription on the lid was 
found to have been copied from a gold brooch in the louvre but the 
tomb was kept on show until 1935 and has appeared in countless 
books on the etruscans and their art she said 
mark jones an expert on coins and medals who assembled the 
fakes from 26 museums in britain and abroad said the exhibition 
was about deception about lying things whenever and wherever 
they are made 
its evidence of what people saw and valued in the art of the 
past because a faked antique shows much more clearly than the real 
thing what collectors valued fakes often reflect what people want 
to believe he said 
when we fall in love we arent totally rational in assessing 
our loved ones qualities jones said you can fall in love 
with an object but others will see through it because they dont 
share your love for it 
the show demonstrates how fakes are exposed by electron 
microscopes ultraviolet light xrays and radiocarbon dating 
the british museums own archaeologists in 1881 brought back a 
babylonian inscription from what is now iraq it speaks of the 
renovation of a temple and the large revenues it received from the 
king and ends up saying this is not a lie it is indeed the 
truth 
but modern studies showed it was a lie written in about 1000 
bc and purporting to be 1000 years older probably by priests 
who wanted to strengthen their temples claim to its rights and 
income 
the letter of christ appears in the ecclesiastical history 
of eusebius known as the father of church history who was 
probably born in palestine about 313 and became a bishop 
in the invented letter christ blesses king abgar for his belief 
in christs miraculous cures 
then theres the furry trout 
a scotsma wrote home from canada in the 17th century about the 
abundance of furried animals and fish asked to provide an 
example of furry fish he obliged and a modern canadian is still 
at it putting rabbit fur on stuffed trout with a text saying fish 
in great depths and penetrating cold grow a dense coat of 
protective fur 
one of these fish was brought to us by someone who thought it 
was genuine said geoffrey swinney of the royal museum of 
scotland 
we said it was a hoax and sent him away but the story had got 
out and public demand to see the furry fish was so strong that we 
had to make one a fake twice over

prime minister giulio andreotti of italy at a 
ceremony in which he received an honorary doctorate of law from new 
york university urged americans to look beyond stereotypes of his 
country 
the award coincided with the establishment of a university chair 
in italian studies to be named for alcide de gasperi the 
architect of italys postworld war ii recovery and andreottis 
mentor 
the 71yearold andreotti who has served six times as italys 
prime minister noted thursday that more than 70 us universities 
and colleges have set up programs on italy 
the spontaneous germination of a cultural osmosis between 
italy and the united states must not serve as a pretext for 
neglecting the development of these relations even today there 
persists in america a stereotypical vision of our country 
we would like to offer our american friends a view of italy as 
she is today without masking her defects without propagandizing 
but by highlighting her civil social cultural and artistic 
achievements

warm home after spending five weeks in a snowcovered storm drain 
the poor little thing looked awful when we got her out she 
was just skin and bones said nicole lonsdale who helped find 
the cat for her neighbors peter and teri tyson 
tootsie disappeared jan 26 apparently entering an open storm 
drain which was sealed off by a snow plow clearing the road in this 
southern maine city the tysons said 
the tysons and neighbors searched the area but gave up hope of 
finding the 6yearold cat until late last week 
tyson was chatting with lonsdale in her driveway saturday when 
he heard a faint meow from the nearby drain he prided the lid off 
the drain with a crowbar then got a ladder and climbed into the 
drain calling tootsies name 
the cat poked her head out of a pipe and scampered for tyson 
who wrapped her in a pillowcase 
its been freezing and there is no food down there and water 
would have been running on her said lonsdale who carried the 
cat home to an amazed mrs tyson 
an animal hospital said no special medical attention was 
necessary so the tysons and their two children have simply been 
pampering their pet 
she wants to be around us all the time now mrs tyson said

police capt gary walberg said he was reading a report on the 
theft wednesday when he happened to peer out of his office and saw 
the man described in the report jacket hat and all 
he matched the description to a t walberg said

the 21st annual reeking regatta sets sail this 
spring but organizers say the event will change its name because 
the bayou where its held is recovering from its pungent pollution 
problems 
we feel theres been a marked improvement said buffalo 
bayou coalition president anna martin whose environmental group 
sponsors the anything that floats race held since 1969 
the reeking regatta will be held april 7 but next years race 
will be called the buffalo bayou regatta 
the event was launched to call attention to the mammoth 
pollution woes of houstons largest bayou due largely to the 
citys notoriously inadequate sewer system 
but ms martin said system improvements have reduced the amount 
of fecal bacteria a measure of human and animal waste in water in 
the bayou 
the most recent city measurements taken last week showed 
bacteria levels at most monitoring stations were below the maximum 
considered safe for boating and other recreation that doesnt 
involve getting into the water 
a lot of improvements have been made compared to about a year 
ago said zaki ahmad an engineer in the city public works 
department

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says his 
department will use its own recipe when drawing up food labels to 
give consumers more information on what they eat 
in effect yeutter has told health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan that a plan for requiring improved nutrition 
labeling for most foods may fly in the food and drug administration 
but not necessarily in the agriculture department 
we will certainly study and evaluate what hhs has suggested 
yeutter said thursday theres some merit in having these rules 
as consistent as possible but we make our own decisions at usda 
sullivan told a food policy conference on wednesday that the 
grocery store has become a tower of babel because of so many 
labels confronting consumers he said some labels omit vital 
information and make unfounded health claims 
the fda has label jurisdiction over foods except those 
containing meat and poultry products which are the domain of the 
agriculture department 
under the fdas proposal which would be implemented in three 
steps processors would have to disclose the fat fiber and 
cholesterol content of packaged foods 
current requirements put in place 17 years ago call for 
nutrition labeling only when a manufacturer adds vitamins minerals 
or proteins or makes a nutrirional claim about the product about 
60 percent of packaged foods now list nutrients 
yeutter speaking to the same group as sullivan was asked if 
his department would follow up on sullivans proposal 
were going to proceed at what we believe is a systematic and 
rational way to deal with these issues he said 
well certainly try to reach the same fundamental objectives 
as all of us have in mind but we intend to do it our way and 
we may well take part of what secretary sullivan suggested and 
apply it but there may well be some parts that we would not 
apply 
echoing complaints by foodindustry representatives yeutter 
objected to sullivans apparent willingness to accept 
differentiated labeling requirements on a statebystate basis 
i dont happen to think thats a good idea he said it 
seems to me that consumers will pay a significant cost if we end up 
with different labeling systems in 50 states that doesnt set a 
good example for the world doesnt set a good example here in my 
judgment 
yeutter for years including his service as us trade 
representative in the reagan administration has pushed hard for 
liberalized trade under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
one of the aspects of the current uruguay round of gatt 
negotiations he said is the harmonization of international health 
regulations for agricultural products 
yeutter said it would set a bad example at the bargaining table 
if the united states is not able to harmonize its own domestic 
labeling regulations while seeking such uniformity on the 
international level 
there is no disagreement at usda with the fundamental objectives 
of sullivans plan but we want to do it right he said 
if secretary sullivans proposal turns out to be right thats 
great yeutter said but if we think theres a better way at 
usda were going to do it the better way 
as he has many times before yeutter said food safety decisions 
should be based on scientific knowledge not on emotional issues 
such as last years controversy about the chemical alar used on 
apples the current issue in california over the use of malathion 
to control medflies was also cited 
yeutter said he fully supported the administrations proposal to 
ease back on current delaney clause restrictions on the use of 
additives shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals 
he said the rules should be changed to permit a negligible 
risk approach to substances instead of trying to eliminate all 
risk 
we ought to have objectives that are achievable not 
objectives that are unachievable yeutter said all we do is 
deceive people when we lay before them objectives or goals or 
legislative requirements that will never be achieved

the case of us district judge robert 
aguilar charged with using his office to do favors for felons 
went to a federal court jury thursday after a prosecutor described 
him as a man who had lost his sense of limits 
its a shakespearean tragedy a greek tragedy justice 
department lawyer said of aguilars case he told the jury a 
conviction would keep the flame of justice alive for those who 
dont have anybody an insider to go through the back door 
but doron weinberg lawyer for codefendant rudy tham accused 
prosecutors and the fbi of an extraordinary misuse of government 
power and said it was the government not the defendants who had 
obstructed justice 
us district judge louis bechtle sent the jury to begin 
deliberations late thursday on eight felony charges against aguilar 
and two each against tham a former teamster leader and abe 
chapman an 83yearold selfstyled exmobster who was once related 
to aguilar by marriage 
aguilar 58 of san jose a 1980 appointee of president jimmy 
carter is accused of approaching two fellow judges to try to 
influence the criminal cases of tham and ronald cloud the judges 
longtime friend who was convicted of bank fraud 
he also is charged with helping another friend vera hoff 
conceal her presence in mexico where she fled to avoid a tax 
evasion sentence with twice tipping off chapman about wiretaps 
with telling thams lawyer to lie to the grand jury about aguilars 
involvement in the case and with lying to the fbi to derail a 
grand jury investigation 
several of the allegations are combined in a charge that aguilar 
used his office as a racketeering enterprise to obstruct 
justice the first such charge against a federal judge 
aguilars lawyer patrick hallinan claimed in his closing 
argument wednesday that the prosecution was trying to slander and 
smear aguilar by calling him a racketeer

former skipper joseph hazelwoods 
defense tried to prove a helmsmans error grounded the exxon valdez 
by focusing expert testimony on the last 13 minutes of the tankers 
shattered voyage 
using computer simulation and complicated charts two experts 
tracked the ships passage second by second as it moved through 
the valdez narrows into prince william sound on march 24 
peter shizume and joseph winer showed jurors in hazelwoods 
criminal trial calculations indicating the tanker would have missed 
bligh reef if the helmsman had turned the rudder right even two or 
three minutes before it rammed the reef and spilled nearly 11 
million gallons in the nations worst oil spill 
winer indicated that the helmsman for unknown reasons turned 
the rudder to the right then back to the left in the last moments 
before the disaster plowing right into the reef on the ships left 
side 
shizume an engineer from hicksville ny who created a 
complex computer program to simulate ship accidents said the 
helmsman could have saved the ship if hed turned only half as far 
as called for by a third mate 
winer a marine surveyor from boonton nj who analyzed the 
ships course recorder said he believes the grounding occurred 
about three minutes later than assumed and that a hitch he 
observed in the recorder reflects the unexplained counter 
rudder turn left 
shizume who used various scenarios of what might have happened 
to the tanker said it would have missed bligh reef by two miles if 
the helmsman had turned 10 degrees right 10 minutes before the ship 
ran aground 
the third mate gregory cousins who was in control of the 
tanker while hazelwood went to his cabin said he gave the 
10degree order to helmsman robert kagan but didnt look to make 
sure kagan was turning until it was too late 
the mate suggested that the helmsman failed to follow the order 
because he had problems with steering but the defense has also 
suggested kagan had hearing problems and may not have heard the 
order 
shizume said his study of the ships course recorder showed that 
kagans average turn during the critical period was 4 degrees 
what is your opinion as to what he was doing asked defense 
attorney michael chalos 
he looks like he was swinging the rudder back and forth 
apparently without any commands to do so the retired sperry 
gyroscope co engineer said 
hazelwood 43 faces up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines if convicted on all four criminal counts against him 
during crossexamination of shizume assistant district attorney 
brent cole tried to shift blame back to hazelwood 
so if captain hazelwood had been on the bridge and ordered a 
5degree right rudder turn he began to ask but was cut off by a 
shouted objection from chalos 
objection your honor its independent of whether captain 
hazelwood was on the bridge or a chimpanzee the lawyer said of 
the calculations 
superior court judge karl johnstone upheld the objection

a molecule created in a california laboratory 
has shown in a test tube experiment that it can ambush the aids 
virus and keep the deadly disease from spreading according to a 
study published today 
dr john j rossi a researcher at the bechman research 
institute of the city of hope in duarte calif reports in the 
journal science that his laboratory has made a synthetic ribozyme 
that can genetically cripple the aids virus and prevent it from 
reproducing 
the ribozyme said rossi is inside the cell and its waiting 
there like a soldier waiting for the enemy to come 
ribozymes eventually could be useful in combating aids and other 
virus infections he said but the technique is still years away 
from being ready to treat patients 
rossi in a telephone interview said his team first developed 
the ribozyme and then made a gene that instructed cells to make the 
molecule 
the synthetic gene then was placed into living human cells in 
test tubes and the cells were exposed to the aids virus rossi said 
the ribozyme was able to block the aids virus from reproducing 
inside the cells 
the ribozyme works like molecular scissors that slice the 
ribonucleic acid of the aids virus thus blocking the virus from 
making copies of itself 
ribonucleic acid or rna is used by the virus to force cells to 
make more virus by cutting the rna said rossi the virus is 
permanently crippled 
the ribozyme itself is a copy of an rna that other scientists 
found in a plant virus those researchers discovered that a small 
part of the plant virus rna acted like an enzyme and was capable of 
selectively cutting any part of the genetic pattern in a target 
virus 
the term ribozyme refers to an rna that acts as an enzyme by 
permitting a reaction to occur within a cell 
rossi said a major advantage of the ribozyme is that after it 
attacks and cuts the rna in one virus the molecule releases itself 
and then can attack other virus particles 
it can do it again and again and again said rossi it is 
like one soldier cutting down 10 or more of the enemy 
the ribozyme can be designed to attack any part of the viral rna 
and leave other portions alone rossi said he believes the ribozyme 
also could be used to combat virtually any kind of virus including 
those that cause colds and flu 
it could be used to treat any virus at all because they all 
use rna he said by destroying the rna you can inactivate the 
viral function 
rossi said two other laboratories now plan to test his ribozyme 
in combating viruses in laboratory animals 
even if it proves effective in animals rossi said the ribozyme 
cannot be used against aids until some way is found to introduce 
the synthetic gene clinically into humans a technique that could 
take years to develop 
he said researchers must find a way to assure that the ribozyme 
gene goes directly to the proper place within the target cells he 
said there are several theoretically possible ways of doing this 
but none is ready for tests 
we dont have any scientific proof yet that a genetically 
engineered cell in a living animal will do anything said rossi 
but in test tube experiments the technique appears to be 
powerful 
in addition to rossi scientists that took part in the study 
were nava sarver of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases a part of the national institutes of health 
pairoj s chang of loma linda university and four others from the 
city of hope medical center 
the journal science is published by the american association for 
the advancement of science

the people who worked for lyndon johnson in 
this town are buzzing and often furious about a new biography 
of their old boss that says he stole his election to the senate in 
1948 
why why why would a man want to spend this much of his life 
writing about a fellow that he cant stand and whose reputation he 
is so passionately bent on destroying demands an injured jack 
valenti an aide in johnsons white house 
i think it is a dishonest biography says bob hardesty who 
used to write johnsons speeches and helped him write his memoirs 
i dont think it pretends to be fair i think it is the work of a 
man with a burning unnatural hatred for his subject it only 
presents a dark evil negative side of lyndon johnson 
the book means of ascent by robert caro pictures a 
youthful johnson who is willing to do almost anything to appease an 
allconsuming political appetite 
it is the second of caros projected fourvolume lbj biography 
caro already has devoted 14 years to the task the first volume met 
with equal hostility from some johnson fans one book critic said 
it demonstrated enraged animus against lyndon johnson 
the new volume is just out but excerpts ran in the new yorker 
magazine and they were the talk of washingtons texas community 
extexas newspaperman bob mann now teaching at emory amp henry 
college in southwestern virginia says this weeks mail brought 
three sets of xeroxed copies of the excerpts from friends who were 
afraid he might miss them 
caro in the books introduction acknowledges that he paints a 
portrait of a despicable person 
while bright and dark threads run through most of johnsons 
life caro writes no bright thread is visible in a period when 
johnson was all but totally consumed by his need for power and by 
his efforts to obtain it 
the book covers the years from johnsons 1941 defeat for a 
senate seat in a rigged election to his 1948 victory by 87 votes 
in a 1948 democratic runoff over an enormously popular former 
governor coke stevenson 
the theft by johnson of that primary election has been fixed in 
texas lore for years but caro provides new evidence 
the book also says johnson pulled strings in washington to 
enhance the power and value of a texas radio station that made him 
a millionaire 
and it says johnson made shamelessly political capital from his 
war career which amounted to flying under enemy fire for only a 
few minutes then accepting a silver star from gen douglas 
macarthur 
he didnt seize the silver star says horace busby a 
johnson associate for 20 years macarthur who was a political 
general gave it to him to curry favor with franklin roosevelt who 
liked johnson what was johnson to do throw it back 
as for lbjs stolen election busby says johnson went before 
a statewide electorate seven times after that and it was never a 
factor 
caros critics say his legwork is meticulous and his writing 
thrilling but his viewpoint warped they say he finds little good 
or balanced to say about johnson and nothing bad in stevensons 
record despite his touch of racism 
history buff jeff patterson an aide to rep mike andrews 
dtexas says stevenson comes across as saint coke 
caro sets out to make johnson look like a real jerk says 
patterson give me wartsandall but dont try to overdo it 
political reporter david broder reviewing the book in the 
washington post said caros johnson is a complete scoundrel 
and a lying cunning utterly unprincipled operator 
caro did not respond to messages asking for a reply we dont 
want to respond to a single review said paul bogaards publicist 
for alfred a knopf which has printed 250000 copies of the book 
former johnson aide lloyd hackler says caro puts more emphasis 
on the negatives and god knows johnson had those than on the 
positives but adds its probably the best job of research that 
anybody has ever done on johnson 
valenti calls caros work this loathsome book but admits 
he read every word of the serialization and now will proceed to 
read the book whole 
valenti mourns the impact the book is likely to have on 
johnsons place in history 
caro writes engagingly and that torments me he says this 
may become the definitive johnson biography 
but hardesty says he has no such worries over a period of 
time when the historians have their say hell come out a 
fullbodied figure flawed but an attractive man who had a great 
impact on the country

lawmakers say an imprisoned former official 
will open new areas in the probe of federal housing scandals 
with testimony about grants and contracts under exhud secretary 
samuel r pierce jr 
congressional investigators are seeking testimony that pierce 
made politically tainted contract awards while he headed the 
department of housing and urban development during the reagan 
administration sources said thursday 
the chairman of the house government operations housing 
subcommittee rep tom lantos said his panel will vote next week 
to grant immunity to dubois gilliam 
gilliam who was a deputy assistant secretary of hud under 
pierce is serving an 18month sentence at the federal prison in 
lompoc calif for a conviction in a hudrelated case 
lantos dcalif called gilliam a key player in awarding 
hud grants under several programs including the secretarys 
discretionary fund and said he will provide critical new 
information 
mr gilliams testimony will open new areas not dealt with 
previously by the subcommittee lantos said 
lantos said the panels republican members would vote with the 
majority democrats next tuesday to ask a federal court to grant 
use immunity in exchange for gilliams testimony the immunity 
would bar prosecution of gilliam based on his testimony to the 
subcommittee or information developed from that testimony 
gilliams testimony is planned for late april 
lantos said arlin adams the courtappointed independent counsel 
who is investigating pierce and other former hud officials told 
him that immunity for gilliam would not conflict with his 
investigation 
he said adams probe is limited to activities involving huds 
moderate rehabilitation program that provided renovation subsidies 
for lowincome rental housing and his panel was looking into other 
areas 
pierce has refused to testify before lantos subcommittee since 
making one voluntary appearance last spring 
several former pierce aides also refused to testify citing 
their fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination among them 
was deborah dean pierces former top aide 
pierce has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and accuses the 
subcommittee of targeting him despite evidence to support his 
position 
pierce attorney paul l perito said he questioned whether 
gilliam would provide truthful testimony or merely seek to curry 
support for a reduced sentence perito also said it could interfere 
with the independent counsels review 
lantos said gilliam was receiving no inducement such as a 
reduction in sentence to testify 
he said gilliam has been cooperating with the subcommittees 
staff and information he has provided so far appears to be both 
accurate and reliable 
gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary in huds community 
planning and development office subcommittee staff investigators 
have visited him at the california prison and sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said he could provide testimony about 
pierces role in contract awards 
former hud officials described gilliam as a trusted pierce aide 
and agency documents show that many funding requests were routed

a tax policy aimed at encouraging investment 
by rich individuals and corporations is raising the federal deficit 
and boosting the tax burden on lowerincome americans says a study 
financed by labor and endorsed by democratic leaders 
if pre1978 fairness were restored to the income tax nine of 
every 10 americans would pay less and the government would collect 
an additional 675 billion a year citizens for tax justice 
reported thursday that would be enough to wipe out the budget 
deficit in two years or less 
the real aftertax income of the richest 1 percent of the 
population averaging 400000 a year jumped by a staggering 110 
percent since 1977 said the a laborfinanced washington research 
organization during the same period the aftertax earnings of a 
34000ayear family grew by 1 percent 
we have had a massive ripoff and the middle class is stuck 
with the bill rep david obey dwis said in endorsing the 
findings 
the arrows of fairness are pointed in the wrong direction 
said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
nevertheless gephardt told reporters democratic leaders are 
not ready to endorse the studys call for tax increases on 
profitable corporations and highincome individuals 
he said the partys leadership hopes to complete work soon on a 
tax policy including whether social security taxes should be cut 
the report was the latest round in a partisan debate over 
whether americans are better off than they were before presidents 
reagan and bush took office 
a recent congressional budget office report concluded that since 
1980 the 20 percent of americans with the lowest incomes have seen 
their federal tax burden rise while the wealthiest 20 percent have 
seen a drop in taxes 
the administrations office of management and budget said the 
poorest 20 percent are paying the same share of the federal tax 
burden that they paid in 1980 while the richest as a group are 
paying a larger portion 
the citizens for tax justice analysis traced tax changes back to 
1978 during the carter administration congress approved a tax 
bill that year that raised exemptions and standard deductions for 
all americans but also cut the tax on capital gains which 
benefited chiefly those with high incomes 
the new report blamed two factors for the tax shift away from 
the rich reagans 1981 tax reduction which cut the top individual 
tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent and boosted incentives for 
saving and investment and a steadily increasing social security 
tax 
the 1978 and 1981 tax cuts are worth 931 billion to the 
richest 10 percent of americans this year while the remaining 90 
percent are 256 billion worse off the report said as a result 
the federal treasury has 675 billion less than it otherwise might 
have had 
robert mcintyre director of citizens for tax justice told a 
news conference that as a result of those tax cuts 
the top 1 percent of the population with average pretax 
incomes of 549000 each now enjoys an average tax cut of 82196 
a year compared to the pre1978 federal tax system adjusted for 
inflation a 36 percent drop the cost in 1990 of the tax cut for 
these extremely wealthy people is a staggering 844 billion 
in contrast 90 percent of american families now pay 
considerably more in federal taxes than they would under the 
pre1978 system adjusted for inflation the typical middleincome 
family earning 31000 pays 409 or 7 percent more in taxes 
the poorest fifth of all families pays 21 percent more 
the report credited the 1986 tax overhaul with partially 
correcting what citizens for tax justice views as inequities in the 
federal system however mcintyre said that law credited a new 
inequity by taxing some income of the richest people at a rate 
lower than applies to many earning less 
the report called for raising the maximum rates on topincome 
individuals and corporations to 38 percent which would bring in 
30 billion more a year those individuals now pay a maximum rate 
of 28 percent corporations pay up to 34 percent

top finance officials from the worlds seven 
largest industrial countries will discuss volatile currency markets 
at a special meeting next month but private economists question 
how successful the session will be 
treasury secretary nicholas brady confirmed on thursday that 
finance ministers and central bank presidents from the united 
states japan west germany britain france italy and canada 
would gather in paris on april 7 
while brady insisted there was no special urgency propelling 
the talks they are coming at a time when the us dollar has been 
rising in value against other currencies in particular the west 
german mark and the japanese yen 
a higher dollar threatens to enlarge an alreadyhuge us trade 
deficit by making foreign products cheaper for americans while 
raising the cost of us goods overseas 
the dollars strength is of great concern to the 
administration said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co it constitutes a recession threat because it is a further 
risk to an alreadybeleaguered industrial side of the us 
economy 
while last years trade deficit of 1086 billion was 29 percent 
below the alltime worst deficit of 1521 billion in 1987 
progress in boosting us exports has slowed in recent months 
because of the dollars increases 
brady testifying to a house appropriations subcommittee 
thursday said the administration hoped further gains could be made 
this year in reducing the trade deficit however he conceded that 
progress isnt as fast as i would like it to be 
the dollars advance has occurred despite coordinated 
intervention by the united states and other governments to sell 
dollars on foreign exchange markets and buy other currencies 
some analysts suggested that since government intervention has 
proved largely unsuccessful the officials of the socalled g7 
countries might discuss making coordinated moves to change interest 
rates 
higher interest rates in japan and west germany would tend to 
bolster their currencies while lower interest rates in the united 
states would make dollardenominated investments less attractive 
but such action would need the approval of federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who has been resisting administration 
pressure to lower interest rates because of concern about 
inflation greenspan also will attend the paris g7 meeting 
economists also questioned the likelihood of some bold 
initiative to lower the dollars value especially in light of 
bradys general caution in interfering in private market operations 
the g7 process is dead in the water said c fred bergsten 
head of the institute for international economics with exchange 
rates moving in the wrong direction it cries out for more 
effective international coordination 
brady who visited european capitals last week led the effort 
to schedule the special meeting he sees it as an opportunity to 
advance economic coordination among us allies said an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
french economics minister pierre beregovoy told reporters in 
paris that he had stressed to brady the need for greater 
cooperation especially in light of the economic problems that 
might arise with the reunification of east and west germany 
some private economists have expressed concern that the 
reunification could prove to be inflationary because of the 
proposal to exchange west germany marks for east german marks on a 
onetoone ratio 
however norbert walker chief economist for deutsche bank the 
largest bank in west germany told reporters in washington that he 
believed reunification could be accomplished without a surge in 
inflation or a big jump in west german interest rates 
walker said increased consumer demand would not trigger higher 
inflation because much of the demand would be met by foreign goods 
helping to lower west germanys large trade surpluses while 
sluggish economic growth in europe would help hold down interest 
rate pressures 
beregovoy said the g7 officials were scheduled to be in paris 
in early april anyway to wrap up details for a new bank for 
european reconstruction and development being created to support 
emerging democracies 
the meeting will occur just one month before a scheduled may 7 
session in washington to coincide with the spring meeting of the 
international monetary fund

a study of more than 20000 heart attack 
patients has found that one drug saved lives as well as another 
that costs about 10 times as much 
but officials at genentech inc maker of the more expensive 
tissue plasminogen activator or tpa said thursday that the 
treatment procedure in the study hampered that drugs effectiveness 
genentech is consulting us cardiologists about the need for 
another study that follows procedures generally used in the united 
states said g kirk raab the companys president and chief 
executive officer 
the research released thursday at a medical conference in 
florence italy was conducted in italy and elsewhere in europe 
it found that a patients risk of dying before leaving the 
hospital was the same whether he was treated tpa or with 
streptokinase made by hoechst ag of germany 
tpa is widely used in the united states streptokinase is more 
popular in europe 
an editorial in the new england journal of medicine last year 
said one treatment with streptokinase costs 78 at a san francisco 
hospital while tpa costs 2268 a separate report has cited a 
10fold difference 
the italian researchers found an overall death rate of 89 
percent after treatment with tpa and an 85 percent rate after 
treatment with streptokinase statistically those rates are the 
same 
tpa and streptokinase are designed to destroy blood clots that 
have caused heart attacks by blocking a crucial blood vessel 
the newly announced study bears out what a number of 
cardiologists have been really saying for the last four or five 
years that there has been absolutely no scientific evidence that 
tpa was superior to streptokinase said an american investigator 
familiar with the results william oneill of william beaumont 
hospital in royal oak mich 
streptokinase would now appear to be the drug of choice based 
on factors of cost said dr claude j lenfant director of the 
national heart lung and blood institute in bethesda md 
but he said the price of tpa might fall as technological 
improvements reduce production costs 
the italian study involved 20749 patients with acute heart 
attack from 13 nations they were randomly assigned to receive 
either streptokinase or tpa 
heparin which keeps blood vessels open after other drugs 
dissolve the clot was tested in combination with the two drugs 
the death rate for the tpaheparin combination was 92 percent and 
for the streptokinaseheparin combination 79 percent 
but the patients in the study who got heparin received it much 
later in the course of therapy and through injections under the 
skin rather than intravenously said david stump genentechs 
director for clinical research in a telephone interview from 
florence 
stump said all major us trials with tpa used intravenous 
heparin administered within four hours and said that was the 
treatment favored by nearly all us cardiologists 
the situation is confusing said raab since the results 
are inconclusive in regard to us medical practice the need for a 
new trial using the standard us heparin regimen is indicated 
tpa holds about twothirds of the market for the drugs in the 
united states while streptokinase has most of the other third 
another clotdissolving drug eminase is marketed by smithkline 
beecham but was not included in the italian study 
clotdestroying drugs are credited with helping to improve 
survival and shorten the length of hospital stays among the 15 
million americans who suffer a heart attack each year about half 
die making heart attack the leading cause of death in the united 
states 
genentech which announced a merger agreement last month with 
roche holding ltd the swiss pharmaceutical giant reported sales 
of tpa increased 30 percent in 1989 to 197 million 
the companys stock thursday dropped 112 to 2612 on the 
new york stock exchange 
raab said he didnt know how the study would ultimately affect 
sales

federal aids testing experts are encouraged that 
the vast majority of the 2 million people who have been tested for 
the aids virus arent infected even among highrisk groups 
from 1985 to 1989 25 million tests for hiv the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome were performed by 63 
publicly funded prevention programs across the country the 
national centers for disease control said thursday 
of the tests given 149639 or 6 percent were positive the 
cdc said 
out of more than 1 million test subjects in the last two years 
whose aids risk groups were known two groups accounted for more 
than 70 percent the cdc said 
heterosexuals at risk including those with highrisk partners 
or multiple sex partners made up 44 percent and 29 percent were 
heterosexuals who reported no aids risk factors but were tested 
anyway 
fourteen percent were homosexual or bisexual men who make up 
the largest group of aids victims and 9 percent were heterosexual 
intravenous drug abusers the secondleading aids risk group 
positivetest rates were highest for homosexual men who abused 
injectable drugs 17 percent of such test subjects were told they 
were infected the homosexual or bisexual men tested were infected 
at a rate of 165 percent 
still a very high proportion of tested homosexuals and drug 
abusers are not infected said dr stephen bowen deputy 
director at the cdcs center for prevention services 
we still have an opportunity to protect them 
the cdc said that 12 percent to 30 percent of aids tests are 
apparently repeat tests leaving an estimated 2 million people 
tested the cdc said 
in its report the cdc said many of the estimated 1 million 
hivinfected persons in the united states remain unaware of their 
infection of persons who are aware a substantial proportion 
had their infection identified in publicly funded counseling and 
testing programs 
demand for the publicly funded tests has increased from about 
80000 in 1985 to a projected 1 million when 1989 tests are 
totaled bowen said 
health officials dont have a real good handle on the number 
of people who have been tested at private physicians offices not 
participating in the publicly funded aids programs bowen said 
such tests are not necessarily reported to health officials 
more than 120000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states with more than 72000 deaths

backers of us support for a united nations 
familyplanning agency are seeking to reverse president bushs 
decision to exclude the organization from this years foreign aid 
bill 
four senators two democrats and two republicans told bush in 
a letter thursday that they hope for a compromise failing that 
they said they plan to force the issue which led to a veto of last 
years foreign aid bill 
both the house and senate voted last year to give 15 million to 
the united nations population fund known as unfpa to help carry 
out its family planning activities in more than 140 countries 
around the world 
but the provision ultimately was dropped from the foreign aid 
bill after bush vetoed the measure the white house had come under 
heavy pressure from antiabortion forces who complained that the 
agency operates programs in china which uses forced abortions and 
sterilizations to carry out its onechildperfamily policy 
in their letter sens patrick leahy dvt barbara mikulski 
dmd nancy kassebaum rkan and mark hatfield rore argued 
that third world population growth poses a grave threat to our 
own future security because of the increasing pressures it places 
on the environment and on the political stability of poor countries 
supporters of aid to unfpa are optimistic they can prevail this 
time around in part because the population agency is willing to 
provide extraordinary safeguards to make sure the money is not used 
in china and in part because of growing gop fear of highlighting 
the abortion issue 
the senators told bush that unfpa has agreed to permit the 
united states to earmark its population aid for specific countries 
whose family planning practices are in line with us values and 
will allow audits to make sure the money isnt freeing other funds 
for use in china 
the agency has received no us aid since president reagan 
halted it more than five years ago and a congressional source said 
it is anxious to regain american participation for the 
symbolism as much as for the money unfpa expects that if the 
united states resumes participation its contributions would grow 
in later years said the source who demanded anonymity 
with the population of the developing countries projected to 
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s we cannot afford to 
remain outside the unfpa the senators wrote 
renewed confrontation serves no ones interest they said 
asking the administration to open discussions with capitol hill 
aimed at finding a compromise 
a group of moderate house and senate republicans sent a similar 
letter last month to secretary of state james a baker iii calling 
for renewal of us aid to unfpa and chastising opponents for 
miscasting the argument as an abortion issue 
bushs veto last year sent the wrong signal to the american 
public and the international community regarding the republican 
partys support for international family planning services they 
wrote 
this is a womens issue a family issue an environmental 
issue and an international security issue said the gop group 
which included two women house members running for the senate this 
year reps lynn martin of illinois and claudine schneider of 
rhode island it remains an issue of great importance to the 
republican party

the late malcolm forbes left orders to give all 
forbes inc employees an extra weeks pay a break on personal 
loans and some free advice on what to do with the money enjoy 
it 
steve forbes forbes son and successor as editor in chief of 
forbes magazine and chief executive officer of the corporation 
told staffers thursday that in accordance with my fathers 
wishes the company was giving each of them an extra weeks pay 
and forgiving all debts up to 10000 
as pop put it like a lottery its pure chance as to who 
benefits his son wrote in a letter to employees referring to 
the loan amnesty 
as for the extra pay forbes added his advice should be 
no surprise enjoy it 
don garson a magazine spokesman said the bequest surprised 
staffers at the forbes building on fifth avenue in manhattan 
i didnt find out about it until you called me and im the 
pr man here he said in a telephone interview but it was 
something he malcolm had made clear to the kids 
garson said the debt amnesty was particularly generous because 
forbes employees of more than a years experience are able to 
borrow money from the company at relatively low interest rates he 
said that many of the magazines 750 employees had taken such loans 
asked about those thrifty souls who had not garson laughed and 
said im sure many of us here are saying damn it why didnt i 
borrow something 
garson said he was told the forbes family would have no comment 
on malcolm forbes bequest the letter speaks for itself he 
said 
he said the gift was in character for forbes who always had 
the attitude that the employees were giving to him rather than the 
other way around 
forbes was 70 when he died feb 24 of a heart attack at his 
estate in new jersey estimates of his wealth ranged into the 
hundreds of millions of dollars 
in london a british magazine thursday published what it touted 
as forbes last interview in which he spoke of his good health 
i dont think this life is for hibernating and getting ready 
for the next one i think you are given it for a purpose and that 
is to live it live while you are alive forbes was quoted as 
saying in hello magazine 
forbes spoke enthusiastically about his next adventure to brazil 
in a hot air balloon during the interview at his south london home 
on feb 23 and about his love of motorcycles 
i am very lucky to have the health to do all this because that 
you cant buy he was quoted as saying i would just like to 
stay around a while and keep doing more of the things i am doing 
the magazine included seven color photographs of forbes in his 
london house and earlier pictures from forbes 70th birthday bash 
in august in morocco

slicing 15 billion out of next years defense 
budget would leave a strong us military capable of confronting 
the rapidly dwindling soviet threat the chairman of the senate 
budget committee says 
sen james sasser dtenn called for the reductions thursday 
as part of a plan to pare pentagon spending by 80 billion annually 
within five years it was the latest democratic assault on 
president bushs proposal to spend 303 billion for defense in 
fiscal 1991 7 billion more than this year 
with easing eastwest tensions military spending about 
onequarter of bushs proposed 124 trillion budget has become a 
focus of debate in congress this year 
most democrats and some republicans want to cut deeper into 
pentagon spending and use the money to help reduce the deficit 
fortify social programs or reduce taxes 
sasser embraced a plan that would cut defense spending next year 
to 291 billion 5 billion below this years level the chairmans 
proposal would be 15 billion below the figure needed to keep pace 
with inflation which in the unusual world of budget arithmetic 
translates to a 15 billion cut 
under the proposal the current activeduty roster of 21 
military men and women would ultimately be reduced to 15 million 
future purchases of trident submarines b2 stealth bombers 
railcarried mx missiles and several other systems would be 
eliminated 
but he said the reductions would still leave 529 warships 34 
fighter wings 15 active army divisions and 10 reserve divisions 
thats an extremely large measure of security for a world 
where as cia director william webster has declared the major 
hostile forces have irreversibly changed sasser said 
sassers embrace of the cuts ran into objections from the budget 
committees ranking republican sen pete domenici of new mexico 
domenici said there is too much uncertainty over the soviet unions 
future to begin making deep defense cuts 
i dont know what that means in reference to the 11000 
nuclear warheads aimed at the united states by the soviet union 
domenici said 
in another clue to the direction lawmakers are heading a senior 
member of the senate armed services committee said that panel would 
also recommend lowered spending levels for the pentagon 
sen j james exon dneb told reporters that he believed his 
committee would recommend defense budget authority in the 291 
billion to 293 billion range compared with the 3069 billion 
proposed by bush budget authority is new spending some of which 
occurs over several years 
its going to be a slowing down a stretching out possibly a 
significant reduction in some areas exon said 
across the capitol democrats on the house budget committee 
completed the second of two consecutive days of closeddoor 
meetings on the defense budget 
rep john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee told the legislators thursday that he 
preferred keeping next years military spending just below 300 
billion according to an official who attended the session that 
would be nearly 4 billion less than bushs figure 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee met with the group on wednesday but offered no spending 
recommendation said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity aspin will meet with the lawmakers next tuesday and 
present them with a list of possible cuts

a house committee chairman is calling for 
legislation to put an end to pentagon slush funds that he said 
totaled 43 billion last year 
rep john dingell dmich accused the defense department on 
thursday of laundering money through the treasury and hiding 
billions of dollars in littleknown surplus accunts 
dingell chairman of the energy and commerce committee and its 
investigations subcommittee also contended that pentagon officials 
have misled congress about the funds 
i suggest that we come up with an amendment to this years 
appropriations bill to terminate both of these accounts to prevent 
the unauthorized squandering of this enormous stash of taxpayers 
money he said in a letter to rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee 
money appropriated by congress must be obligated or spent during 
a specific time period dingell noted if not the authority to 
spends the funds lapses and the money is returned to the treasury 
but obligated funds that are not spent and lapse are then 
laundered through the us treasury and come back to the military 
services as noyear m accounts dingell wrote 
unobligated funds that lapse also return to the military 
services as noyear funds in another slush fund merged surplus 
accounts he said 
with the existence of these slush funds the congress could 
virtually kill a weapons program and find out years later that it 
was still being funded from these accounts the congressman said 
dingell recently released a general accounting office report 
that said the air forces accounting system understated by tens of 
billions of dollars the cost of major weapons systems 
while his investigations subcommittee was examining the 
pentagons financial management systems dingell said we 
recently discovered an astonishing set of littleknown 
semisecret slush funds 
a defense department source who requested anonymity disputed 
dingells assessment saying the funds are recognized accounts not 
slush funds 
these are not funds sitting idly there and the defense 
department is using at their whim the source said 
susan hansen a pentagon spokeswoman said the department would 
have no official comment on dingells assertions 
dingell said his subcommittee reviewed a series of congressional 
hearings last year in which lawmakers expressed shock over the 
existence of the accounts 
in one instance the air force provided a lower number for the 
socalled m account to sen john glenn dohio 
when sen glenn asked gen ron yates the air force witness 
about the size of the air force m account he was misled by gen 
yates who claimed there was only 17 billion in the account not 
46 billion dingell said 
if the sen glenn was shocked by the m account he would 
have been bowled over if gen yates had told him about the 
additional 66 billion merged surplus account the congressman 
said

president hafez assad called for an 
indefinite holy war with israel and bitterly decried the changes 
sweeping eastern europe as a boon to the jewish state 
the syrian leader also hinted he would make some changes in his 
own tough brand of socialist rule 
in a youth rally thursday marking his baath partys 27th 
anniversary in power assad denounced the recent wave of soviet 
jewish emigration to israel in his first public comment on the 
matter saying migrating jews would force palestinians from their 
homeland 
let us now perceive that israel was the first beneficiary 
among all nations of the world of the international changes that 
have taken place assad told about 6500 people in a basketball 
arena 
the rally appeared to be a cross between an american high school 
pep rally and a soviet may day parade a brass band pounded out 
patriotic songs along with the tune rock around the clock 
and the youthful spectators chanted and cheered in unison as one 
bank of the crowd used silk sheets to form massive portraits of 
assad or to spell out patriotic slogans 
the crowd interrupted the president 61 times with applause or 
chanting during his 95minute speech 
assad said the jihad or holy war against israel should be as 
long as time 
we are just at the beginning of this long time he said 
it is not we who have to ask until when rather the enemy is 
the one who should ask this question 
assad complained that in socialist countries once resolutely 
opposed to israel zionists are now active everywhere 
assad said proisraeli delegations now often visit socialist 
countries an apparent reference to israeli delegations that have 
won recognition for their country from some eastern european states 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia reestablished relations with 
israel in the past six months all the eastern european countries 
except for romania broke ties over the 1967 arabisraeli war 
he alleged that zionists in those countries went in hot 
pursuit of their foes in a campaign ranging from attacking the 
ideas of their opponents to attack and assassination in the 
streets 
assad said israel still seeks a greater israel from the nile 
to the euphrates referring to a radical version of zionism that 
foresaw jewish rule from egypt to iraq 
he denounced an expected mass migration of soviet jews to israel 
due to greater freedom in the soviet union 
he equated this freedom with aggression calling it the 
freedom of occupying other peoples territory and expelling them 
from their land 
assad did not hold the soviet union a longtime syrian ally 
responsible for the jewish exodus however and he repeated his 
assertion that the relationship between syria and the soviet 
union is now as firm as ever 
the soviet union has given syria massive economic and military 
aid including combat jets tanks and missiles syria reportedly 
owes the soviets 15 billion for weapons 
assad mourned the arabs inability to forge a united front 
the danger threatens all and the need for solidarity and 
unity is everybodys need he said 
assad has patched up a longstanding rift with egypt but other 
arab states especially egypt and jordan have tried in vain to 
ease syrian rivalries with iraq and the mainstream of the palestine 
liberation organization 
while he decried the changes in eastern europe assad hinted he 
would make some changes in his own tough brand of socialist rule 
he suggested a government study on limiting use of emergency 
laws that have been in force for decades and spoke of broadening 
parties and organizations in the national front dominated by the 
ruling baath party 
but assad stressed that his version of organized freedom was 
based on community rather than just individual rights 
freedom and its organization go side by side he said if 
separated anarchy and despotism prevail

the president of an ohio company accused the 
defense department of spreading false allegations about its work on 
a critical part for missiles without informing the manufacturer of 
the charges 
documents released thursday said the pentagon is investigating 
piqua engineering inc of piqua ohio following charges that 
safety and arming devices produced by the company failed almost 
half of its tests for leaking 
the devices are used on several missiles including the 
sidewinder sparrow standard and patriot 
it is believed that any of the issues can cause premature 
or prevention of detonation of the devices that could result in 
the failure of missiles or other weaponry containing the piqua 
devices said a defense contract administrative message sent to 
army and navy commands in several states 
but john scarbrough sr president of piqua defended his 
companys product and said the pentagon failed to contact him about 
the problems 
the defense criminal investigative service never talked to us 
has never written us a letter at any time scarbrough said in a 
telephone interview they are giving out untrue allegations 
without talking to us 
scarbrough said his 40yearold company has been manufacturing 
safety and arming devices for at least 20 years and has never had a 
single complaint in this instance he believes six disgruntled 
employees are using the government system against the company 
as far as im concerned the allegations are all wrong 
scarbrough said everyone wants to blow the whistle but no one 
wants to check we could have told the defense department if they 
asked us 
pentagon spokeswoman susan hansen said the department would 
neither confirm nor deny an ongoing investigation 
in a jan 30 memorandum the pentagons inspector general office 
warned that the potential may exist for failure of the safety and 
arming devices manufactured by piqua 
this could subsequently impact on the integrity of the weapons 
systems containing these devices wrote william g dupree the 
deputy assistant inspector general for investigations 
the documents were obtained by the project on government 
procurement and released by the independent group to the associated 
press and other news organizations 
piqua employees allegedly have been told not to reject devices 
even if they fail leak tests instead workers are to repair the 
devices using epoxy resin to seal the leaks 
military specifications call for the devices to pass the leak 
tests to ensure that they are sealed and to prevent contamination 
and corrosion 
piqua is believed to have internally experienced as high as a 
50 percent failure rate of safety and arming devices being leak 
tested said the inspector generals document 
the areas most commonly encountering leakage problems are 
either around the window of the device or in the area of the 
electrical connector 
scarbrough said that after initial checks the failure rate was 
less than 1 percent and when they leave here they dont leak at 
all information on the tests have been substantiated by three 
defense department inspectors at the ohio plant he said 
the inspector generals memo also said questions have been 
raised about holes in the device to which detonators and detonator 
sleeves are attached 
it is believed the holes cannot correctly accept the 
detonators and sleeves and that piqua utilizes unauthorized repair 
and rework procedures to correct the problem the document said 
the memo said there had been allegations that employees were 
told to use hand tools to enlarge holes that were too small and 
resorted to unapproved oversized detonators on holes that were too 
large 
in response to that allegation scarbrough said the navy knew 
all about the bored holes 
in addition inspectors at piqua allegedly approved electrical 
wires on the devices that had failed military specifications on 
solderability tests 
scarbrough said the wiring the company received was tested and 
rejected if defective and replaced by the vendor defense 
department inspectors at his plant also examined the wiring he 
said

with a stroke of his pen last fall 
president bush invited people fleeing countries where population 
control is accomplished by forced abortions and sterilizations to 
seek asylum in the united states 
but a chinese family that is apparently the first to accept that 
invitation is beginning to wonder whether it was made sincerely 
the order enabled li jin lin and his family who previously had 
been separated and threatened with jail the right to live and work 
temporarily in the united states 
their application to live here permanently however is bound in 
red tape 
government officials refuse to say whats holding the case up 
but the familys lawyer kathleen rimar said she is beginning to 
doubt bushs commitment to protecting chinese refugees 
these four chinese people came here right at the worst time 
rimar said they seem to be the testing case for whether this is 
going to work so far i think the executive order isnt doing very 
well 
bushs directive allows foreign nationals who are fleeing forced 
abortion or sterilization policies to apply for political asylum in 
the united states 
the directive though not specifically for chinese was part of 
a nov 30 order allowing many chinese citizens to remain in the 
united states indefinitely after the june massacre of prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing 
bush made the order while vetoing stiff sanctions against china 
li a 37yearold machinist and his 34yearold wife wang sai 
zhen fled the city of fuzhou after ms wang became pregnant with 
the couples second child she had undergone several abortions and 
was told another would endanger her life 
the couple and their 19yearold nephew chun kong cheung made 
their way to canada and paid smugglers about 1500 each to get 
them into the united states according to the government 
immigration officers caught them in albany last march and sent 
li back to canada allowing his wife to stay temporarily because of 
her advanced pregnancy when li and his nephew tried to cross the 
border again in october they were thrown in jail 
li staged a hunger strike and said he would rather serve prison 
time in the united states than risk death or sterilization if he 
were forced to return to china 
antiabortionists took up the cause 
the rev paul schenck a local minister involved in operation 
rescue brought the case up with aides to vice president dan 
quayle then came bushs order protecting chinese refugees 
in a very direct sense the order means lives saved 
schenck said in a broader sense it equates abortion as one of 
the tools of a repressive government the same attitude that would 
bring the chinese government to run over protesters with tanks is 
the same malevolence that would lead them to kill nascent 
children 
things have improved for the lis the immigration and 
naturalization service allowed them to remain in the united states 
while their asylum application was decided they were freed from 
jail received work permits and settled in new york city 
but the state department has yet to rule on their asylum 
request submitted last year and the regional immigration court 
that must hear their case is in the midst of a reorganization 
meaning it may be months before the uncertainty is resolved rimar 
said 
john j ingham district director of the ins said he was not 
free to comment on the case nat kingsley a state department 
spokesman said the departments policy is not to comment on 
individual asylum cases

the senate in its first major vote on a 
compromise clean air bill rejected a proposal to tighten controls 
on toxic air pollution thursday night after senate leaders said it 
threatened their agreement with the white house 
the vote to kill the amendment was 6533 
senate leaders later put off a vote on a proposal by sen robert 
byrd dw va to help coal miners who lose their jobs because of 
tougher pollution controls the 700 million safety net for 
miners was strongly opposed by the bush administration 
sen bob dole rkan said passage of the byrd amendment would 
jeopardize the compromise agreement with the administration and 
could lead to no clean air bill being approved by the senate 
the senators adjourned early today and would resume 
consideration of the bill later in the day 
the amendment on tougher controls on toxic chemicals from 
automobiles was one of a string of strengthening provisions 
expected to be brought to the floor by senators arguing the 
compromise legislation isnt strong enough 
the vote was seen as an indicator on the strength of support for 
a compromise worked out by senate leaders and the bush 
administration to ease senate approval for the first toughening of 
federal air pollution controls in 13 years 
sen frank lautenberg dnj called his amendment necessary to 
protect citizens from cancercausing chemicals noting more than 
half of such chemical releases come from automobiles trucks and 
buses 
but the measure opposed by the bush administration because of 
its reported 15 billion price tag was described by sen max 
baucus dmont as a deal breaker meaning its passage would 
cause a compromise agreement with the bush adminstration on clean 
air to fall apart 
if this amendment passes the deal will be off the deal will 
be busted and there very well could be no clean air act said 
baucus a floor manager for the bill shortly before the vote 
both senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen 
bob dole rkan the minority leader asked that the amendment be 
rejected 
the senate throughout the day wrestled with a stream of 
amendments and more were expected 
a number of senators unveiled proposals earlier thursday for 
more stringent provisions many aimed at automobiles 
lautenberg whose amendment was among those unveiled told 
reporters we know the odds are heavy against us 
the clean air measure represents the first tightening of federal 
air pollution control laws in 13 years it calls for sweeping curbs 
on smogcausing pollution from automobiles and industrial plants 
and requires new cuts in acid rain pollutants from coalfired 
electric power plants 
a similar bill remains in committee in the house 
in earlier floor action thursday the senators 
approved by voice vote a requirement that the environmental 
protection agency take into account carbon dioxide emissions which 
contribute to global warming when making urban transportation flow 
studies 
approved 8016 an amendment that requires that hcfcs or 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons be phased out by 2030 the hcfcs can 
sometimes subsitute for cfcs or chlorofluorocarbons chemicals that 
are widely used in refrigeration and other areas but cause damage 
to the earths protective ozone layer 
hcfcs typically have only about 5 percent of the 
ozonedestroying potential of the most common cfcs critics of 
their use have cautioned that they still pose a threat to ozone 
depletion if relied on permanently 
meanwhile an amendment requiring automakers to increase fuel 
efficiency by setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions was 
withdrawn by its sponsor sen richard bryan dnev the measure 
had been vigorously opposed by the auto industry and the white 
house and deleted from an early draft of the bill 
the lautenberg amendment was the first of a series of 
strengthening amendments that are expected to be offered by 
senators who believe the senatewhite house compromise weakened key 
parts of the original senate bill 
the proposed amendments still to be considered would tighten 
controls on smogcausing pollution from automobiles and industrial 
sources in urban areas as well as expanding the use of alternative 
cleanburning fuels 
the amendments would expand the cities that would have to meet 
pollution standards through the use of cleaner fuels require fleet 
operators to use clean burning fuels impose a second round of auto 
tailpipe emission standards in the year 2003 and broaden the 
number of businesses that would have to comply with smogrelated 
pollution controls so small polluters are included 
another amendment in the package would reinstate in the bill a 
requirement that the environmental protection agency impose a 
pollution control program if a city fails to enact one the epa 
currently has the authority

a guerrilla chief says his fighters have 
ended a 16year struggle that included the 1985 takeover of palace 
of justice in which 11 supreme court justices and more than 100 
others were killed 
other rebel groups however refused to follow the decision 
thursday by the april 19 movement or m19 to begin disarming and 
to accept a government amnesty 
the m19 leader carlos pizarro now is seeking power within the 
political structure as a candidate for mayor of bogota in elections 
sunday he and president virgilio barco are to sign the final peace 
accord saturday 
in a ceremony thursday the guerrilla group turned 65 weapons 
over to an international committee headed by a venezuelan general 
ernesto uscategui the committee included socialist international 
delegates from chile britain finland and switzerland 
pizarro gave up his 9mm automatic pistol caracol radio network 
reported 
pizarro then told about 800 followers in the southern town of 
santo domingo to hang up their battle fatigues and prepare to fight 
for peace said hernando correa an interior ministry spokesman in 
bogota 
radio reports had placed the number of m19 followers in the 
town at 1800 
m19 spokesman ramiro lucio told reporters all the rebels 
weapons would be turned over in santo domingo and nearby hobo 
radio reports said the government was planning to melt down the 
weapons and use the metal to forge a monument to peace 
five other guerrilla groups including the national liberation 
army blamed for 293 kidnappings in the first two months of the 
year say they will keep up their armed struggles 
the national liberation army has pledged never to negotiate with 
the government as part of its campaign to disrupt sundays 
congressional and municipal elections the group wednesday and 
thursday kidnapped 10 people including election officials police 
and political leaders a police statement said 
but m19s action thursday disarms an outfit that mounted some 
daring rebel attacks in 1980 it took the us ambassador and 15 
other envoys hostage five years later its capture of the palace 
of justice and battle with security forces led to the deaths of 115 
people including 11 supreme court justices 
the disarmament came after 13 months of peace talks with the 
barco administration in santo domingo 
m19 promised to abandon its armed struggle and transform itself 
into a political party in exchange for amnesty 
the movement directed its campaign against capitalism and us 
imperialism and had links with other latin american underground 
groups 
pizarro had previously thanked pope john paul ii for the roman 
catholic churchs mediation in the talks in a message thursday to 
the papal nuncio angelo acerbi the m19 leader asked the pope to 
pray for peace in colombia 
acerbi was one of the 16 ambassadors taken hostage by the m19 on 
feb 27 1980 when the group seized the dominican republic embassy 
in bogota 
the embassy takeover ended two months later and unconfirmed 
reports said the government paid up to 2 million for the release 
of the hostages including us ambassador diego asencio 
the m19 formed in 1974 takes its name from the date of 1970 
presidential elections which it claimed were fraudulent

the bush administrations blueprint for the 
nations transportation network will take the country back to the 
horse and buggy years instead of guiding it into the next 
century a former transportation secretary contends 
by forcing states to come up with more money the 
administrations national transportation plan only hurts those 
states that can least afford it sen brock adams dwash said 
thursday night on the senate floor 
adams and other democratic critics said the plan bears the thumb 
prints of white house chief of staff john sununu who is bent on 
seeing that president bush keeps his pledge of no new taxes 
everyone seems to be paying except the federal government 
said adams this plan isnt a road map into the 90s its a road 
map back into the horse and buggy years when toll roads and 
turnpikes were the rule not the exception 
the criticism by adams who served as transportation secretary 
under president carter from 1977 to 1979 was far from the only to 
greet the proposal developed by transportation secretary samuel k 
skinner 
skinner unveiled the 129page plan with bush on thursday morning 
and defended it later before the house surface transportation 
subcommittee which must formulate a fiveyear highway and mass 
transit spending plan 
many of the proposals in skinners plan moving america into 
the 21st century are contained in the administrations 1991 
budget proposal 
the plan calls for more toll roads local gas taxes user fees 
private investments competition deregulation research into 
futuristic systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as 
increased attention to safety and protection of the environment 
skinner said that with the higher responsibility comes greater 
local flexibility and room for innovation although rural states 
should end up with a greater share of federal dollars as urban 
areas find other financing arrangements it is up to congress to 
fight out the balance between urban and rural interests he said 
to make our position known were going to want to get a lot 
of advice and watch this evolve in the house and the senate he 
said 
skinner received republican praise for the plan rep bud 
shuster rpa called it an excellent first step other gop 
members of the subcommittee praised the proposal to encouraging 
private investment 
but even republicans expressed impatience with the continued 
fight over the combined 25 billion in two transportation trust 
funds one for aviation and one for highways that comes up in 
any transportation debate 
both are financed from fuel and airline ticket taxes and other 
fees paid directly by users of the transportation system the money 
is supposed to be used for capital improvemets but the aviation 
fund has been used over the years to help support operations of the 
federal aviation administration 
the republicans differed from the democrats only over who should 
be blamed for holding up the funds which like the social security 
trust fund help make the budget deficit look smaller 
subcommittee chairman norm mineta dcalif called the funds 
the administrations swiss bank account and said they should be 
removed from the budget 
skinner said his plan calls for spending the money but he 
argued that large amounts are earmarked for projects for which the 
bills will come in the future

john r dunne president bushs nominee to be 
assistant attorney general for civil rights appears to be on a 
fast track to confirmation 
the senate judiciary committee voted thursday to approve dunnes 
nomination and a staff aide said a vote by the full senate could 
come as early as today 
dunne a former new york state legislator has the bipartisan 
backing of both new york senators the states house delegation and 
gov mario cuomo but some committee members voiced reservations 
about him 
at dunnes confirmation hearing wednesday the committee grilled 
dunne on his lack of civil rights experience membership in clubs 
that excluded women votes against school busing and stock holdings 
in a company that does business in south africa 
but only one committee member sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
opposed dunnes confirmation in thursdays voice vote 
im not going to vote for mr dunne but im not going to make 
an effort to persuade others against him metzenbaum said 
metzenbaum repeated his complaint that dunne had done nothing to 
change the discriminatory policies of clubs to which he had 
belonged but he added i believe mr dunne will probably be as 
good an appointee to head the division as we are going to get from 
this administration 
sen arlen specter rpa also sounded lukewarm about dunne 
i think his temperament will be at least reasonably good he 
said 
dunne 60 of garden city ny was nominated in january to be

a major factor behind the nations infant 
mortality rate low birth weight is headed the wrong way after 
10 years of improvement according to federal experts in infant 
health 
the rate of low birth weight rose 2 percent from 1985 to 1987 
the latest year for which statistics are available after a 9 
percent drop from 1975 to 1985 the national centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
sixtynine out of 1000 babies born in 1987 were under 5 pounds 
considered low birth weight compared with 675 out of 1000 in 
1985 the 1987 figures nonetheless are improved from 739 
reported in 1975 
the rate of babies born at very low birth weight below 3 
pounds 4 ounces is rising even faster up 68 percent from 1975 
to 1987 the report said in 1987 124 out of every 1000 births 
was below 3 pounds 4 ounces compared with 116 in 1975 
this rate is a small proportion of births but its 
increasing which makes it more difficult in the future to improve 
our infant mortality rate said dr carol hogue director of the 
cdcs division of reproductive health 
improvements in the nations infant mortality rate in the past 
two decades are largely because of improved means of keeping 
premature babies alive not because of improved infant health she 
said 
were not sure we can continue to improve infant mortality by 
improving this very expensive technology she said we really 
need to focus on reducing the incidence of low birth weight 
babies weighing less than 3 pounds 4 ounces are 90 to 100 times 
more likely to die in their first year than other babies she said 
infants under 5 pounds run at least a five times greater risk of 
death than babies of normal weight about 6 to 9 pounds 
the rate of low birth weight among black infants is more than 
twice the rate for white infants 1271 per 1000 blacks in 1987 
compared with 568 for whites the disparity has widened since 15 
years ago when the rates were 1309 for blacks and 626 for whites 
low birth weight rose less than 1 percent for whites between 
1985 and 1987 but 2 percent for blacks 
the atlantabased cdc called the reasons behind the blackwhite 
gap complex more black women are in highrisk groups for 
underweight babies poor unmarried under 20 poorly educated or 
lacking proper prenatal care the agency said 
other factors include poor nutritional status closetogether 
pregnancies and higher rates of unwanted births the cdc said more 
than 16 percent of underweight black babies were unwanted or 
mistimed pregnancies the cdc said 
most low birthweight babies are premature babies nearly six in 
10 are born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy compared with the 
standard 40 weeks each year some 35 million babies are born in 
the united states

a white woman who wanted to have her terminally 
ill husbands baby has charged in a lawsuit that a sperm bank and 
fertility service mixed up its samples and she gave birth to a 
black daughter 
the woman sued idant laboratories inc and advanced fertility 
services saying the girl now 3 is being subjected to racial 
prejudice and taunted because she does not resemble her parents 
the womans attorney david gould would not specify the charges 
in the lawsuit which was filed in state supreme court last fall 
but disclosed only thursday in an article in the new york law 
journal 
the woman loves her daughter but she wanted to have her 
husbands baby said gould shes the target of scandal and 
discrimination where she lives and the little girl is being teased 
and taunted by her playmates little kids are saying to the girl 
how come you look different than your mommy 
gould cited her emotional distress in asking reporters not to 
disclose the name of the woman whose husband died of cancer in 
april 
the couple paid idant to store the husbands sperm in 1985 after 
he was diagnosed with ewing sarcoma a cancer that requires 
chemotherapy the couple feared could damage his sperm according to 
the lawsuit 
as my husbands illness progressed the woman was quoted as 
saying in court papers i decided that having his child was the 
bond that would link us together forever 
in march 1986 the woman contacted advanced fertility services 
to get the sperm samples from idant and use them for insemination 
advanced fertility and idant disagree about what happened them 
robert whittaker a lawyer for advance fertility said the sperm 
samples it used to inseminate the woman came from idant 
idants president dr joseph feldschuh said the sperm used by 
advanced fertility was not from the sample his company provided 
the child was born in december 1986 and soon after it became 
apparent that she was not my husbands child the woman said 
feldschuh said the dna of the husbands sperm stored at idant 
does not match the childs dna 
the dna tests done in this case definitively establish that 
the problem was not with idant labs feldschuh said the child 
is not from our donor 
whittaker refused to comment on the childs paternity saying he 
had not seen any dna test results 
under new york law the woman will have to prove which party is 
at fault if the case goes to trial the defense could try to 
suggest that neither defendant is at fault that the woman 
conceived the child in an extramarital affair and not as a result 
of an insemination procedure 
gould said that because of the likely scandal the woman would 
never have sued had it been up to her he suggested that her 
required cooperation in a state case against idant resulted in her 
case becoming public 
frances tarlton spokeswoman for the state health department 
said her agency is investigating idant which feldschuh called the 
largest licensed sperm bank in the country because of a complaint 
related to the womans suit she refused to comment further

finish the contras once and for all ortega said 
thousands of weapons are in the hands of the people he said 
since the sandinistas feb 25 election loss to the united 
national opposition known as uno there have been numerous reports 
of citizens being armed and trained for combat in sovereignty

in his speech ortega repeatedly spoke both of leading the 
sandinistas as an opposition force in the future and about the 
sandinistas demand that the contras demobilize in the transition 
period 
there is a calm like those before the storm ortega said 
and we have the obligation of avoiding being swept away by the 
tempest of civil war 
the situation in the country is very tense very 
complicated ortega said 
he said contras fighting the sandinistas since 981 continue to 
attack in nicaraguan territory with the complicity of the 
honduran government and the united states government 
about 10000 contras most of their force are based in honduran 
jungle camps near the nicaragua border 
both ortega and mrs chamorro have called on the contras to 
demobilize before the inauguration but rebel leaders have refused 
saying she must first take office and the new government be given 
control of the sandinista peoples army and the interior ministry 
forces 
ortega repeatedly has said the sandinistas will not do that 
he said thursday he could not turn over to uno weapons of the 
army and interior ministry 
i dont have any weapons to give up because the weapons belong 
to the people ortega said 
ramiro gurdian acting president of nicaraguas most important 
private business group wrote ortega expressing concern about the 
distribution of weapons 
we permit ourselves to remind you that although you are ending 
your presidential period the acts of these last days also will be 
judged by history he said 
the proposed law coupled with the handling of weapons by 
certain sectors of society place in imminent danger nicaraguas 
incipient democracy and the loss of life of nicaraguans who would 
find themselves totally defenseless physically and legally the 
letter said 
meanwhile transition teams for both the 14party uno coalition 
and the sandinistas met all day thursday for talks on the handing 
over of power but neither side would release information on the 
talks 
mrs chamorro left the country thursday for talks with 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez in caracas presumably 
centering on the transition of power she was then to travel to 
houston for two weeks of physical therapy for a fractured knee

a hollywood executive and his wife 
were gunned down by two sons who stood to inherit more than 10 
million police alleged in announcing one sons arrest and an 
international hunt for the other 
in an eerie twist the one still at large had cowritten a 
screenplay which his mother helped type about a son who kills 
his rich parents 
lyle menendez 22 was arrested thursday and charged with his 
19yearold brother erik with the shotgun slaying of his father 
jose menendez and mother mary louis kitty menendez 
the couple were slain in august while watching television in 
their beverly hills mansion 
ive been in this business 33 years and ive heard of few 
killings as savage as this one said police chief marvin d 
iannone said

to detain erik menendez believed to be in israel playing in a 
tennis tournament 
jose menendez a 45yearold cuban immigrant was chairman of 
live entertainment inc a video and music distribution business 
affiliated with carolco pictures inc producers of the rambo 
movies 
investigators dismissed earlier speculation that organized crime 
was behind the slayings because of alleged business links to 
menendez company 
iannone said the investigation uncovered physical evidence that 
linked the sons to the killings the probe also focused on a 
vanished computer record concerning menendez will 
menendez and his wife were killed by shotgun blasts at close 
range as they watched television in their library one evening 
their sons reported the killings saying they found the bodies 
after a night out 
nothing appeared to be stolen from the spanishstyle 5 million 
home and nothing indicated that the killers forced their way in 
the focus became very clear over the past few months that the 
sons did it iannone said we were just waiting for the glue 
binding it together 
police on thursday served search warrants to seize the records 
of a psychologist who had worked with the menendez family some 
forms of communication between psychotherapists and their clients 
are protected under law it wasnt known what records were seized 
by police

killings 
who knows what really goes on in families iannone said 
under terms of the parents 9yearold wills the sons share an 
estate worth 10 million to 17 million a 400000 life insurance 
policy also has been distributed to the sons

a 14month campaign to make honesty a city 
policy ends today and its leader and police say they cannot tell a 
lie it hasnt rid the city of liars cheats or scoundrels 
we havent wiped out crime or made everybody honest but we 
have made people think about it thats what we intended to do 
said jeb stuart magruder the former watergate conspirator who led 
the take an honest look campaign 
the privately financed 35000 campaign in this midwestern city 
of 566000 closes today with a speech by atlanta mayor andrew young 
and an awards ceremony honoring those whose honesty was exemplary 
the guest list excludes those responsible for an increase in 
crime in columbus last year homicides rose by 29 percent from 
1988 car thefts by 22 percent and aggravated assaultsby 5 percent 
bank robberies dropped 50 percent last year but already this 
year robbers have held up 33 banks compared with 54 all of last 
year 
deputy chief robert kern said neither he nor the street patrol 
officers he oversees have noticed an outbreak of honesty 
crime is up thats for sure he said but i havent 
noticed any more people than normal being honest a lot of people 
call us with information or turn people in but theyve always done 
that 
the idea for the campaign surfaced when the honesty or lack of 
it of columbus residents was questioned in 1988 after the rear 
doors of an armored car flew open spewing bags of cash on an 
interstate 
many motorists who stopped to scoop up the flying cash never 
returned it although one man who returned 57000 became a local 
celebrity 
the allvolunteer campaign initiated by the columbus commission 
on ethics and values targeted city schools churches government 
and city groups its chief weapon against dishonesty was public 
service announcements 
the television and radio spots for example showed a driver who 
backs into an unoccupied vehicle in a parking lot he of course 
leaves a note explaining what happened another person gets too 
much change from a store clerk and gives it back 
but magruder a presbyterian minister said the campaigns 
biggest success was an honesty curriculum in area school districts 
it spread sincerity to 90000 columbus school students through 
workshops essay contests and other programs 
i think it had an effect said howard merriman columbus 
schools assistant superintendent it heightened the awareness of 
teachers and administrators that its important to talk about 
honesty it also helped the students 
other events included a symposium for corporate leaders and 
honesty sunday at churches 
andrew altman a philosophy professor at george washington 
university in washington dc who specializes in law and 
morality said it will take more than a campaign to persuade people 
that honesty is the best policy 
most people are honest most of the time he said in a 
telephone interview restoring ethics and honesty will take a 
general cultural transformation about what we think is important in 
life a return to a life of simple virtues 
magruder who spent seven months in prison after he admitted 
destroying records and committing perjury in the watergate scandal 
said he saw the campaign as making a small inroad into the problem 
i have learned that change can occur in little increments and 
change for the better is something worth doing he said 
magruder said the commission is so satisfied with the effort 
that it plans to target another topic come fall prejudice

the communist partys central committee is 
believed to have begun a key meeting to decide economic and 
personnel matters before the nations parliament convenes later 
this month diplomats said today 
the committee would be meeting for the first time since 
november when the decisionmaking body approved a threeyear 
economic austerity program and announced that senior leader deng 
xiaoping was resigning from his last party post 
there was no official confirmation of the party meeting 
although the street in front of the great hall of the people was 
blocked off this morning an indication that an important event was 
taking place inside 
some diplomats said the meeting appeared to have opened today 
while others said it started on thursday 
the central committee composed of 175 regular and 108 alternate 
members usually meets twice a year once before the annual session 
of the national peoples congress chinas rubberstamp legislature 
the meeting is likely to focus on the nations troubled economy 
and policies to be outlined by premier li peng before the peoples 
congress 
the austerity program has brought down inflation and curbed 
excessive economic growth but has also resulted in the closures of 
thousands of factories and the layoffs of millions of workers 
the party concerned about popular unrest because of the 
economic downturn and the harsh political climate following the 
military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in june is 
expected to approve some easing of austerity measures particularly 
the loosening of credit to moneystarved industries 
the party meeting will also take up personnel changes to be 
approved by peoples congress 
the central committee is also likely to discuss the rapid 
political and economic changes taking place in the soviet union and 
east europe and reaffirm chinas position that it will continue 
along the socialist road regardless of events in other countries 
diplomats said the meeting will probably last until early next 
week communist party general secretary jiang zemin is scheduled to 
leave in the middle of the week on a trip to north korea

other democrats for the gubernatorial nomination 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic said during a debate with 
her democratic rivals thursday night that the issue had never been 
raised in her eight years as treasurer 
but the drug question has become an acid test for the democratic 
candidates richards refusal to answer apparently is behind her 
recent drop in the polls 
the polls show former gov mark white leading ms richards who 
in turn leads jim mattox the state attorney general ms richards 
came to national prominence when she delivered the keynote address 
during the 1988 democratic convention 
white mattox and four minor candidates have said they never 
used illegal drugs white and mattox offered to take a drug test 
before the primary on tuesday 
white and mattox both took ms richards to task over a new 
series of advertisements that question their financial dealings and 
integrity 
ann you know better than what youve been saying on 
television you know its a lie white said 
i think your advertising now is in really poor taste mattox 
said 
one candidate with little backing stanley edward adams jr 
criticized the others for hammering ms richards on the drug 
question too many people right now are trying to destroy this 
lady well we are overreacting he said 
adams said he favored decriminalizing drug use

death threats against her from an austin pay phone police said

with a healthy lead in the polls for 
tuesdays republican primary for governor the folksy humor is 
oozing out of clayton williams like the oil that made his fortune 
the other gop candidates seem well out of hollering range and 
williams was confident enough of victory to skip a televised league 
of women voters debate wednesday night in dallas 
he seemed to be enjoying himself as he made the rounds thursday 
kissing small children and signing autographs with his wife 
modesta 
take a good look at me look at my profile now look at 
modesta he said you think im not the sellingest sonofagun 
youve ever seen 
recent polls have shown williams winning about 50 percent of the 
gop vote he was asked thursday if he thought he could avoid a 
runoff election for the nomination to succeed retiring republican 
gov bill clements 
as a republican it would be much better for our party if i 
were able to make it without a runoff williams said we are 
asking all our supporters to please walk that extra block please 
call on that extra house please make that extra phone call 
then he flashed a grin and said i must be sounding like a 
politician i circled that question pretty good 
the colorful west texas oilmanrancher never before elected to 
public office has sunk 56 million of his own money in an 8 
million campaign that appears to have succeeded in creating a look 
and feel that appeals to texans 
in the extensive tv ads that have bolstered his campaign the 
cowboy hat never leaves williams head he tells fans that he owns 
no shoes just boots and professes to worship the late john 
wayne 
john wayne was a dream of what we all wished we were rather 
than what any of us mortals are williams told a incredulous 
outoftown reporter the good guy who whipped the bad guy who 
was on the side of right law and order 
williams nearest opponent kent hance a former democratic 
congressman who sponsored president reagans 1981 tax cut 
legislation had 22 percent support in a recent poll 
the two other major contenders have earned most of the 
endorsements from the states major newspapers but both tom 
luce lawyer for billionaire h ross perot and former secretary of 
state jack rains remain in single digits in the polls

the food and drug administration says it will 
ban the sale of all nonprescription drugs used to treat enlargement 
of the prostate gland 
the agency said thursday that its review of these products found 
little evidence any of them eliminates arrests or treats the 
condition called benign prostatic hypertrophy 
surgery is currently the only effective treatment the fda said 
the condition causes enlargement of the male gland which can 
obstruct the flow of urine create back pressure in the kidneys and 
cause urinary tract infections that are difficult to treat the fda 
said 
the overthecounter products which contain the amino acids 
glycine alanine and glutamic acid and a plant extract called 
sabal can relieve some symptoms of the condition however their 
use also could lull men with the condition into a sense of false 
security which could delay their getting proper treatment the 
agency said 
few of these products are being sold today the fda said 
about 50 percent to 80 percent of men with the condition will 
develop unstable bladders and have symptoms of frequency and 
urgency of urination 
the fda said the ban will take effect in six months

a childrens advocacy group has asked 
regulators to require broadcasters and cable tv operators to show 
antismoking messages on youthoriented programs if they televise 
sports events sponsored by cigarette companies 
action for childrens television which was instrumental in 
reviving advertising limits for saturday morning childrens tv 
shows on thursday appealed to the federal communications 
commission to close a loophole in a 1969 law that banned 
cigarette advertising from television 
the group said cigarette companies got around the ban by 
sponsoring televised sports events such as tennis tournaments and 
car races and making their brands part of the names of the events 
tv cameras also routinely show billboards advertising cigarettes 
behind the sports action being shown act said calling them 
hidden commercials that subvert the purpose of the 1969 law 
congress passed the law because it had concluded that it is 
not in the public interest to have cigarettes advertised over such 
unique media that reach into every household and are particularly 
viewed by the young act told the fcc 
the young are being bombarded over television by hidden 
messages associated with sports that are meant to show that

wheatstate lawmakers say a bush 
administration proposal to give farmers more planting options could 
hurt farmers by creating lower crop prices 
the agriculture department defended the proposal on thursday 
before a senate agriculture subcommittee but conceded that wheat 
prices probably would drop initially if farmers nationwide were 
given more flexibility in choosing which crops they grow 
bruce gardner usda assistant secretary for economics projected 
that up to 3 million additional wheat acres would be planted if the 
administrations proposal were implemented in 1991 wheat prices 
could fall as much as 1520 cents a bushel he said 
wheat prices are projected to average 380 to 390 a bushel in 
the 1990 crop year according to usda 
however gardner said wheat producers are going to be 
protected by federal subsidies from a drop in their incomes 
overall he contended that farmers would benefit from more planting 
flexibility because they could adjust their cropping patterns to 
take advantage of potential higher prices in the markets 
at issue is a proposal by president bush for more planting 
flexibility for farmers who wish to participate in federal subsidy 
programs 
the lawmakers said they generally agreed with the goal but 
differed with the administration on how best to accomplish it the 
proposal is part of the administrations recommendations for new 
farm legislation to guide agricultural policy during the next 
several years

under the agreement reached in brooklyn state supreme court

the settlement the amount of which was not disclosed was reached 
as attorneys prepared trial summations 
jurors interviewed afterward said they were leaning in favor of 
the 32yearold doctor 
pregos lawyer diane wilner said the settlement was 
reluctantly accepted because the defense said it would appeal any 
jury victory by prego 
in essence i believe they put a gun to our head with the 
appeal she said

years pregos doctor had testified she might have less than a year 
to live 
prego pale and looking tired during the trial said she was 
happy the trial had finally ended 
its been extremely difficult for me she said complaining 
that her health had worsened because of the strain of the more than 
2monthlong trial now its time to take care of myself

settlement which justice aaron d bernstein ordered both sides not 
to disclose although he said it was between zero and 100 
million prego had sought 175 million 
its no ones business except the people who are paying it 
and the person whos receiving it bernstein said it has 
nothing to do with the relative merits of this case

investigators believe a loose motor under a 
subway car tripped a switch that threw part of the train into 
another track and slammed it into a pillar killing three people 
and injuring 94 
a nut holding the motor in place had apparently slipped off 
causing the motor to drag under the sixcar train before 
wednesdays accident john k lauber of the national transportation 
safety board said thursday 
the motor under the third car hit a crossover switch and the 
tripped switch jerked the last three cars onto a second set of 
tracks the fourth car smashed into a steel pillar lauber said 
all of the dead were in the fourth car 
the accident was the worst in the 21 years the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority has operated the regional 
commuter system 
a 37block section of the subway and elevated train line in the 
nations fifthlargest city remained closed today as the 
investigation of the site continued 
sixteen people were still hospitalized two in critical or 
serious condition 
lauber said the ntsb learned thursday of three other incidents 
in the past 15 years when a motor apparently dropped one occurred 
just six months ago he said 
a nut and cotter pin came off a vertical bolt on the motor in 
wednesdays crash and there was extensive damage to horizontal bars 
on the car which were supposed to catch the motor if it fell 
lauber said 
lauber said the ntsb was also told that the same motor had been 
replaced on oct 4 and had been in the shop for routine 
inspections in february 
the regional transporation authority has ordered inspections of 
all older subway cars which date from the early 1960s 
an extra 120 buses were pressed into service to shuttle some of 
the 100000 passengers who ride the trains each day the closed 
section of track was expected to reopen monday 
gov robert p casey inspected the accident area thursday and 
asked for more federal help for the transit authority which 
recently proposed raising the base fare to 150 the highest in 
the country to try to head off a 30 million deficit in the next 
fiscal year 
but in washington transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
septa can no longer run the risk of assuming that were going to 
have a continuous federal income stream because that prevents them 
from living up to their responsibility

pakistan of playing a major role in a thwarted coup engineered by 
the afghan defense minister who defected to a moslem guerrilla 
faction

afghan president najib only exposed the cracks in his shaky 
government in kabul 
at least 56 people died and 200 others were injured in tuesdays 
revolt by soldiers loyal to the renegade defense minister gen 
shah nawaz tanai tanai was supported by fundamentalist guerrilla 
leader gulbuddin hekmatyar 
tanai a battlehardened officer popular among the rankandfile

policymaking politburo the central committee and the supreme 
defense council which maps out the governments strategy in the 
12yearold war against the moslem guerrillas 
among those dismissed from the politburo were said mohammad 
gulabzhoi afghanistans ambassador to moscow and gen abdul qadar 
aga aka a leader of the air force contingents that helped mohammad 
daoud overthrow the monarchy in 1973 daoud was killed in the 1978 
coup that installed the communist government 
during a news conference thursday in kabul najib declared his 
government had been purged of dissidents and that his ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan was now more united than 
ever 
the microbes the radicals among us have been cleansed a 
kabulbased diplomat quoted the 43yearold president as saying 
the diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad reported the government had 
proof that neighboring pakistan played a key role in tanais 
attempts to bring down najib the former chief of the feared secret 
police who was installed by the soviets in 1986 
the government of afghanistan has undeniable documents of 
pakistans interference and participation in the unsuccessful 
coup official kabul radio said 
the government demands that pakistan hand over shah nawaz 
tanai and others who escaped to pakistan said the radio 
monitored in islamabad 
the sovietbacked government regularly accuses pakistan of 
training the moslem guerrillas who are armed by the united states 
and saudi arabia 
as it has always done pakistan denied the charge 
this coup attempt is an internal matter it shows that 
the governments claim of popular support is just a sham said a 
foreign ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
tanai fled afghanistan on wednesday and pakistani officials and 
guerrilla sources said he then defected to the guerrillas whom he 
fought more than a decade tanai returned to afghanistan but his 
exact whereabouts were not known 
 
hekmatyars hezbiislami has split from the other six groups in 
the pakistanbased resistance over leadership disputes leaders of 
the guerrillas governmentinexile say they would never accept 
tanai a hardline communist as an ally 
tanai and hekmatyar bitter rivals during the 12yearold war 
apparently were united in their desire to see najib ousted 
while the plot apparently failed western diplomats in pakistan 
said it still hurt najib politically and militarily and bought 
time for the guerrillas preparing for the socalled summer fighting 
season 
with planes diverted to kabul from other areas western 
diplomats said the guerrillas are now able to move weapons into 
afghanistan 
the afghan air force has been credited for najibs survival 
since the kremlin ended nine years of direct military intervention 
and pulled the red army out of afghanistan in february 1989 najib 
former chief of the feared secret police was installed by the 
soviets in 1986

virginia one of the biggest 
tobaccoproducing states in the country is poised to become one of 
the last states to pass a public smoking bill 
the state legislature on thursday approved a bill restricting 
smoking and gov l douglas wilder is likely to sign it said 
wilders chief of staff jt shropshire 
virginia is among six states with no statewide limits on smoking 
in public it is the nations fifth largest tobacco producer 
i think we can live with it said anthony f troy a 
lobbyist for the tobacco institute 
it is a major positive step toward cleaner air in the 
commonwealth said jane f roberts a spokeswoman for the 
triagency council a coalition of cancer heart and lung 
associations 
but rural lawmakers called the bill another blow to the 
declining tobacco industry 
we are talking about an industry that has helped build this 
commonwealth said delegate charles r hawkins this vote will 
change the direction of this commonwealth forever 
delegate willard r finney said the number of tobacco farmers in 
his county has declined from 1200 in 1980 to 200 today 
unfortunately the tobacco farmer doesnt have any lobbying 
group down here finney said 
the bill would ban smoking in elevators school buses hospital 
emergency rooms school common areas polling places and indoor 
cashier lines 
it would also require nosmoking areas in state offices 
restaurants with 50 or more seats retail stores of 15000 square 
feet or more and educational and health care buildings 
in a compromise with tobacco industry backers the bill allows 
localities to regulate smoking in other public places but would 
limit how strict their ordinances could be in private workplaces 
localities could allow smoking to be banned if half the employees 
agree

hungry residents blocked roads or 
threw rocks in an attempt to get food delivery trucks to stop in 
slums in the northern city of rosario police fired rubber bullets 
at the people 
a 14yearold boy was shot in the leg and five people were 
struck by the rubber bullets reported police in rosario an 
industrial city of 1 million about 185 miles north of buenos aires 
twenty people were arrested 
rosario was the site of the worst violence when food riots broke 
out in several cities in may at least 16 people were killed in 
those riots 
the cost of living has soared an estimated 12000 percent the 
past 12 months and wages have failed to keep pace compared to the 
dollar argentinas currency is worth less than 1 percent what it 
was a year ago 
dozens of misery town dwellers as argentines call the 
neighborhoods gathered before dawn thursday at highways and tried 
to block the roads with tree branches and wooden posts the 
noticias argentinas independent news agency reported 
when trucks and even cars slowed down the shantytown residents 
hurled rocks trying to get them to stop police said 
a 14yearold boy was shot in the leg and five other people were 
struck by rubber bullets police in rosario reported 
police gen fermin almonacid said the majority of the 20 
arrested were common delinquents taking advantage of a social 
situation made explosive by high inflation increasing 
unemployment shrinking wages and hunger 
about one adult out of five works parttime or not at all 
border guards and federal police have patrolled downtown streets 
almost continually in rosario since december 
but neighborhood grocery stores and food delivery trucks still 
have been looted almost daily for weeks despite the distribution 
of thousands of packages containing cooking oil powdered milk 
noodles sugar tea and other basics 
in an indication the unrest may be spreading women and children 
walked into two supermarkets thursday filled bags with food and 
fled 
noticias argentinas said one merchant seeing people gather 
outside gave away bags of rice noodles and other food to keep his 
store from being looted 
newspapers and an economic research group reported thursday that 
the cost of living in argentina rose by at least 62 percent last 
month and may reach triple digits in march 
the daily la nacion citing unidentified government sources put 
february inflation at 62 to 70 percent even the lower figure would 
mean the cost of living for the past 12 months rose by 12231 
percent 
inflation in 1989 was 4924 percent wildly fluctuating from a 
high of 197 percent in july to a low of 56 percent in october 
economists and monetary experts say that despite five major 
austerity plans implemented during the 8monthold government of 
president carlos menem inflation may worsen before it gets better

tired and miffed that she had to undergo a 
second liver transplant the worlds only surviving heartliver 
transplant patient says she wants to go home take a bath and go to 
bed 
i thought i wasnt going to have anymore problems again but i 
guess i was wrong said stormie jones 12 during a news 
conference thursday at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
cuddling a stuffed koala bear that accompanied her to the 
operating room last month stormie said she hopes to return home to 
white settlement texas within a month 
stormie said shes forcing herself to obey doctors orders and 
take short strolls around the hospital so she can return home soon 
i guess its just hope she said of her ordeal theres a 
thing in the back of your head that says get up 
stormie dressed in sweat pants and a childrens hospital sweat 
shirt teasingly sparred with her mother lois susie purcell 
during the news conference speaking softly she professed her 
dislike for being in the public eye and media interviews her fate 
since the second transplant on feb 20 
although she and her mother are optimistic her body will accept 
the new liver stormie said theres a remote chance of rejection 
they told me i might be having a little rejection which made 
me mad she said 
mrs purcell said she credits stormies seemingly fast recovery 
to fk506 an experimental antirejection drug developed in japan 
stormie began taking it in november 
researchers say the drug is more powerful and causes fewer side 
effects than cyclosporine the antirejection medicine stormie 
began taking after her historic heartliver transplant on feb 14 
1984 
stormie required a second liver last month because the first 
transplanted liver was permanently damaged by hepatitis 
the day after her second transplant stormie returned to the 
operating room because of internal bleeding 
i thought now what are you taking out stormie said 
stormie has been playing with other children at the hospital 
reading books and building a wooden doll house 
she said she also is trying to write a book for other children 
about her experiences but so far has completed only a page in part 
because she doesnt like to write 
her first transplant was needed to control effects of a rare 
disease that left her cholesterol levels 10 times greater than 
normal and damaged her heart 
her donor heart has remained healthy doctors said

lithuanian nationalists said today their 
republics legislature still plans to vote this weekend on whether 
to secede from the soviet union contradicting an early report that 
the move had been postponed 
lionginas vasilyauskas spokesman for the sajudis peoples 
movement said the supreme soviet legislature will vote on a 
declaration of independence sunday sajudis members have a 
twothirds majority in the newly elected legislature 
he disputed a report by eduardas potashinkas an editor at 
lithuanian governmentrun television who said the groups 
governing council had decided to put off the vote at a meeting 
thursday night 
potashinkas who has previously supplied accurate information 
said nationalists had dropped plans to vote on a declaration this 
weekend and instead seek the proclamation in the nearest future 
the lithuanian parliament is scheduled to meet saturday with a 
secession vote on the original agenda 
a vote on a proclamation of independence would bring the baltic 
republic into conflict with the kremlin president mikhail s 
gorbachev had warned this week that lithuania would own the central 
government about 34 billion in convertible currency for 
investments made in the 50 years since the kremlin absorbed the 
onceindependent state 
tass quoted lithuanias president algirdas brazauskas as 
saying such a payment would be an extremely difficult task 
gorbachev reportedly indicated moscow may demand lithuania turn 
over the port of klaipeda if allowed to secede as well as a small 
section around drushinikai in extreme south lithuania 
sajudis buoyed by its sweeping victories in lithuanias recent 
elections has decided to force the issue of secession a right 
granted in theory by the soviet constitution to each of the 
countrys 15 republics 
prosecession sentiment in lithuania has been swelling for 
months but sajudis moved this week to preempt gorbachevs plans to 
introduce a vastly more powerful presidency with the right to crack 
down on restive republics 
the national congress of peoples deputies is scheduled to meet 
monday in moscow to consider the presidency proposal the latest 
sajudis decision would provide time to work out a compromise 
between the kremlin and representatives from republics like 
lithuania and georgia who maintain the new presidency would give 
moscow neardictatorial powers over the republics 
national lawmakers were meeting in moscow today in legislative 
committees to consider the new presidency the official tass news 
agency reported potashinkas said lithuanias final course of 
action would be tightly linked to what kind of powers the 
congress confers on gorbachev 
a wave of nationalism has swept through the baltics the eastern 
republic of moldavia and several southern republics 
in december lithuanias communist party became the first to 
break away from the central party since the communists took power 
in 1917 
the national supreme soviet legislature is considering a 
proposed law that would give the republics the right to secede from 
the union but settling financial issues is just one of a daunting 
series of requirements that the republics would have to meet in 
order to secede

vice president dan quayle left today for a 
tour of south america saying he wants to listen rather than 
lecture about how the united states can help its hemispheric 
neighbors with economic development 
the vice presidents trip revolves around two inaugurations 
sunday in chile and march 15 in brazil but he also will stop in 
venezuela barbados argentina and paraguay for talks on latin debt 
and trade problems and on president bushs push to win acceptance 
for panamas usinstalled government 
quayle departed andrews air force base outside of washington 
shortly after daybreak for the flight to caracas venezuela 
in briefing foreign reporters on the eve of his departure 
quayle offered no specifics on what the united states can do to 
help the latin countries with their massive debt and inflation 
problems 
he said he wanted to hear ideas on trade and economic 
development from those countries heads of state 
its very important to solicit their ideas quayle said 
at times the united states gets accused perhaps justifiably so 
of lecturing im not visiting latin america to lecture im 
visiting latin america to listen to get their ideas 
he said the administration is prepared to turn its attention 
more to economic affairs in the hemisphere now that democratic 
elections have sparked political reform in country after country 
previously ruled by dictators 
political development has been successful in the hemisphere 
but we have not been as successful as wed like on economic 
development quayle told reporters 
two countries quayle will visit brazil and argentina are among 
the most severely handicapped economically brazils 115 billion 
foreign debt is the largest in the developing world 
argentina is beset by demonstrations and strikes resulting from 
its 8000 percent inflation rate 
there has been little progress except in mexico on the bush 
administrations socalled brady plan to ease latin american debt 
by getting commercial banks to forgive outstanding loans 
the other goal of quayles trip seeking acceptance of the 
panamanian government installed when the us invasion toppled gen 
manuel antonio noriega still faces resistance 
both chile and brazil refused to invite panamanian 
representatives to their inaugurations 
like other latin governments chile and brazil condemned the 
dec 20 invasion as a violation of panamas sovereignty many latin 
governments contend panamas president guillermo endara needs to 
gain legitimacy through a vote of panamas citizens or its congress 
but us officials insist that the latin resentment over the 
panama invasion is fading 
were moving toward hemisphericwide acceptance of the 
panamanian government general acceptance these sorts of things 
will be worked out said quayles press secretary david 
beckwith he noted endaras recent call for a vote on proposed 
changes in the constitution 
in brazil it is likely that the new government will examine 
the matter in a new light said one brazilian diplomat referring 
to the upcoming inauguration of fernando collor de mello 
sen edward kennedy dmass is accompanying quayle as part of 
the us delegation to the chile inauguration of patricio aylwin 
kennedy was a leading critic of human rights violations under 
outgoing chilean president gen agosto pinochet 
quayle will meet with pinochet who insisted on retaining 
control of the countrys 60000man army even though he will not be 
president 
nicaraguas outgoing president daniel ortega defeated in feb 
25 elections by the usbacked candidate violeta chamorro also 
plans to attend the chile inaugural while us officials have 
refused to meet with ortega or representatives of his marxist 
regime the vice president now would have no objections to such a 
meeting said beckwith however he added that nicaraguan officials 
had not sought a meeting 
quayle will remain for only a few hours in venezuela to meet 
with president carlos andres perez on regional issues

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
today that the phone hoax in which president bush thought he was 
speaking to rafsanjani but spoke instead to an impostor shows how 
important iran is in the world 
irans stature in the world is so high that the biggest bully 
the most arrogant nation in the world is engaged in an effort to 
contact iran rafsanjani said in a sermon 
the incident shows that the us needs to talk to iran but 
with gods grace it is deprived by iran of this blessing said 
rafsanjani his comments were broadcast on tehran radio and 
monitored in nicosia 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington on 
thursday that bush returned a phone call last month to a man he 
thought was the iranian president but it turned out to be a hoax 
bush spoke to the man about the release of us hostages in 
lebanon according to cbs news fitzwater would not give details 
about the conversation 
asked if bush immediately realized that the voice on the other 
end of the line was not rafsanjani fitzwater said i cant tell 
you how we determined it was a hoax 
the bush administration has said it believes that rafsanjanis 
government has influence with the captors of the eight americans 
and 10 other western captives held in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
fitzwater and other white house officials said the bizarre chain 
of events began when a man identifying himself as an iranian 
government official called the white house to say that rafsanjani 
wanted to talk to bush about the hostages 
the call came in a number was given for us to call we were 
suspicious and began checking fitzwater said but ultimately 
the president needed to make the call as part of the check he did 
make the call 
fitzwater said the fact that the call turned out to be a hoax is 
unfortunate but that bush who frequently speaks to foreign 
leaders by telephone remains determined to talk to anybody 
anytime any place to try to gain the release of the hostages

crowds angered by a new tax battled police looted 
stores paraded effigies of prime minister margaret thatcher and 
hurled bottles and eggs in protests across britain dozens of 
people were injured or arrested 
mrs thatcher today blamed a leftist group known as militant 
tendency for the violence thursday night that left the main street 
in the london borough of hackney strewn with glass 
as you know it is not the way to conduct affairs at all 
she said during in appearance in glasgow scotland any conduct 
intimidating or violent is absolutely contradictory to democracy 
there have been four straight nights of violence against the new 
community charge which replaces the system of taxing 
homeowners to pay for government services instead municipal 
councils now divide the costs of services equally among all adults 
in their district 
charges can vary widely depending on the level of services 
provided by a district and since each adult is taxed it means two 
people living in a tworoom apartment would pay twice as much as 
one person living next door in an eightroom house 
anger over the system has sent the conservatives popularity 
plunging to its lowest level in its decade of rule 
local legislators in the district of haringey met today to 
discuss their districts tax which at 974 is one of the highest 
in the country during a meeting of the council monday night 
demonstrations outside turned violent and police had to clear 
shouting protesters from the spectator section 
tony benn an opposition labor party member of parliament said 
this is the first major civil disobedience campaign since the 
suffragettes demanded the vote before the first world war 
the most serious unrest occurred thursday night in hackney east 
london where 5000 protesters gathered outside the city hall 
about 300 police guarding the building charged the crowd when 
members of it began hurling bottles and cans and attacked a police 
car police said they made 57 arrests they said about 30 officers 
and an unspecified number of protesters were injured 
police commander john purnell said about 200 people broke away 
from the main crowd and rampaged through a hackney shopping mall 
hurling trash cans through windows and looting up to 50 stores 
protesters at hackney carried placards reading break the tory 
poll tax smash poll tax and cant pay wont pay the 
labor party and other opponents have dubbed the community charge 
the poll tax after a similar per capita tax that caused a 
rebellion in medieval times 
at camden in north london protesters at city hall screamed 
insults at council members as 400 others blocked the road outside 
a crowd of about 400 jeered council members arriving for a meeting 
at ealing in west london 
police in swindon 70 miles west of london linked arms to form 
a human chain to stop 1000 protesters from forcing their way into 
the council chamber people in the crowd there carried effigies of 
mrs thatcher with a noose around her neck and set one of them on 
fire to loud cheers 
at hull in northeast england security men ejected 50 
demonstrators who screamed abuse at council members protesters at 
dudley in central england threw eggs at council members and 
attacked a policeman 
the new tax takes effect april 1 in england and wales when 
local districts must submit to the federal government their annual 
charges the average household paying about 830 a year under the 
former system will pay about 1100 the chartered institute of 
public finance accountants says 
lowincome and disabled people can receive rebates of up to 80 
percent but critics say that apart from this the new tax is 
unfair because it takes no account of an individuals ability to 
pay 
the community charge is already in force in scotland amid 
widespread protest there northern ireland has its own separate 
system for funding local authority spending 
mrs thatchers intention in changing the tax system was to show 
voters that local laborcontrolled districts were spending more 
than conservativerun districts 
but critics say the government miscalculated the cost of local 
services and some conservativecontrolled authorities are among 
those imposing the highest charges 
in latest opinion polls the conservatives trail labor by up to 
19 points ahead of the next general election due by mid1992

the two germanys today began preliminary 
unification talks preparing for next weeks meeting with the four 
world war ii allies on german unity 
ernst krabatsch east germanys deputy foreign minister was 
meeting with dieter kastrup head of the political department at 
west germanys foreign ministry they declined to comment to 
reporters 
the election commission meanwhile said 24 political parties 
will contest east germanys first free elections on march 18 the 
adn news agency said 
commission spokeswoman petra blaess said the final list includes 
the communists now renamed the party for democratic socialism the 
social democrats the liberal free democrats and the alliance for 
germany a conservative coalition backed by west german chancellor 
helmut kohls christian democratic union 
east germanys 122 million eligible voters will seat a new 
parliament with 400 members 100 less than the current peoples 
chamber 
todays discussions are part of the socalled twoplusfour 
formula of unification negotiations agreed to in ottawa last month 
under that formula the two german nations are to discuss the 
domestic aspects of unification 
on wednesday in bonn the two germanys are scheduled to meet 
with lowlevel officials from the four world war ii victors the 
soviet union the united states britain and france for initial 
talks on how unification would affect european security and the 
concerns of other nations 
while the talks come barely a week before march 18 elections 
that are expected to remove east germanys communist government 
from power the east berlin government is carrying out the dialogue 
with the approval of 15 other parties 
the four world war ii powers have given their blessing to the 
idea of german unification but enormous problems need to be 
overcome 
one of the thorniest stems from moscows insistence that a 
united germany not be a nato member kohl on thursday reassured 
nato members in brussels of west germanys wish for the new country 
to remain in the western alliance 
we will continue talks on all levels nobody need fear germany 
will go its own way he said 
in addition poland on thursday reiterated its demand for a role 
in the talks despite a vote by west germanys parliament that a 
united germany should honor polands western border about a third 
of poland was german territory before world war ii 
west german chancellor helmut kohl had come under fire abroad 
and at home for his previous reluctance to unequivocally state that 
a united germany would never lay claim to land ceded to poland 
after the third reichs 1945 defeat 
kohl apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters 
before federal elections in december had insisted only the 
government of a united germany could address the matter 
the two germanys have formed the front between nato and the 
warsaw pact for over 40 years and a united germany would be a 
colossal country of over 76 million inhabitants in strategically 
important central europe 
west german chancellor helmut kohl favors allowing east 
germanys states simply to join up with their western neighbor 
which would be permitted under the west german constitution 
that would be the quickest route to german unity 
but opposition to this means of unification has been raised in 
both german states and moscow has voiced its concern as well about 
a hasty unification

the government said today it has begun 
indirect talks with moslem separatists in kashmir acknowledging 
the independence movement has reached an unprecedented point 
we have a tough job here but i would say i am meeting the 
right people through intermediaries said george fernandes the 
railways minister who was selected by the government to lead 
efforts to quell the secessionist movement 
it is too early to say what shape the dialogue will take but 
at least the process has begun he told reporters in a srinagar 
hotel 
asked what message he had sent the militants fernandes said 
we have conveyed the government of indias stand on the issue 
he did not elaborate 
the independence campaign in indias kashmir valley has left at 
least 173 people dead since jan 20 in confrontations between 
security forces and the militants there were no immediate reports 
of violence in kashmir today 
across the border in pakistans kashmir region hundreds of 
demonstrators marched near the frontier today and demanded that 
residents of indian kashmir be allowed to decide their future 
a protest leader sultan mohamood promised arms and training 
for the indians mohamood is leader of the azad muslim conference 
a small opposition party in pakistani kashmir 
the campaign for an independent kashmir dates to the 1947 
partition of the indian subcontinent into hindudominated india and 
islamic pakistan which each ended up with a portion of kashmir 
india and pakistan have fought two wars over the region 
fernandes arrived in srinagar the largest city in the valley 
and the focal point of the agitation on thursday with a 14member 
delegation of political leaders who included former prime minister 
rajiv gandhi and deputy prime minister devi lal 
the other members of the delegation returned to new delhi today 
but fernandes remained apparently to begin talks with the 
militants 
it was not clear which of the militant organizations fernandes 
had contacted and there were no signs from any of the groups that 
they had been approached kashmiri moslem groups have said they 
will not settle for anything less than total independence 
the mood of the people is very obvious fernandes said when 
asked his perception of the situation the campaign for secession 
has reached an unprecedented point 
earlier thursday authorities tightened the already strict 
curfew unlike previous days authorities in srinagar did not relax 
the curfew this morning to enable residents to shop for food and 
other essentials 
jammukashmir state gov jagmohan the top administrator for the 
region said there would be no easing of curfew restrictions in 
view of the tension arising from the delegations visit 
on thursday about 40 residents invited to meet with gandhi 
became unruly and blamed his 198489 government for the troubles in 
the mountainous northern state where a lingering movement for 
secession from hindumajority india has escalated in recent months 
also thousands of moslems inside mosques shouted islamic 
slogans and demanded independence as the convoy carrying the 
delegation drove past thursday 
moslems make up 64 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people 
most of the hindus live in the plains of jammu but a small 
minority reside in the kashmir valley gandhis mother former 
prime minister indira gandhi was a kashmiri hindu

a fire broke out in the national 
legislature today and damaged several reception rooms police 
blamed activists who want taiwan to drop its claim to be chinas 
legitimate government 
police said the earlymorning blaze which was put out in 15 
minutes started in one of the reception rooms and may have been 
caused by firebombs 
nearby police discovered a fence had been painted with the 
slogan burn chinese pirates to death strive for taiwanese 
independence and bloodbath taiwan the references were 
apparently to elderly members of the yuan taiwans highest 
lawmaking body 
the members were elected on the chinese mainland shortly before 
1949 when the nationalist government fled to taiwan after losing a 
civil war to communist forces the aging legislators who dominate 
the body have remained in office to support the ruling nationalist 
partys claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of china last month 
the opposition called on them to retire 
many opposition members want the nationalists to give up their 
claim to be the legitimate government of china and recognize taiwan 
as a separate independent country 
less than an hour after the legislature fire a blaze occured at 
the faculty dormitory at national taiwan university police said 
similar slogans were discovered painted on the buildings door and 
they suspected that the fire was set by the same arsonists 
the blaze was quickly extinguished and no major damage reported 
no one claimed responsibility for either fire

portauprince haiti ap hundreds of people some throwing 
rocks blocked streets in the capital today on the fourth day of 
protests triggered by the armys killing of a schoolgirl 
the normally bustling portauprince a city of 1 million was 
virtually deserted this morning with schools and stores closed 
protesters blocked all main streets and rocks were thrown at cars 
on the seafront 
on thursday thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and 
several provincial towns setting fires and calling for the 
resignation of haitis military leader lt gen prosper avril 
three people were killed in the protests thursday including a 
soldier beaten to death by a mob independent radio reports said 
fifteen people were injured in clashes with soldiers according to 
witnesses and a doctor at the state hospital in portauprince 
the government has made no comment on the unrest but a 
highranking government official said today that avril has no plans 
to resign 
avril is ready to make concessions but a hasty departure is 
out of the question said the official speaking on condition he 
not be further identified he gave no indication what concessions 
were contemplated 
avril indicated wednesday he would resign if it was the will 
of the people but said that would cause revolution and chaos 
the protests were triggered by the killing of 11yearold 
rosaline vaval monday in the town of petit goave where 10000 
mourners attended her burial thursday 
radio lumiere a protestant radio station said today that a mob 
went on a rampage in petit goave a town of 15000 on tuesday 
night burning an army outpost ransacking a government building 
and the mayors house 
in gonaives a western port city of 40000 mobs plundered the 
house of mayor alexandre louissaint a baptist pastor and 
ransacked his church and a government building according to a 
resident who spoke anomously 
earlier about 3000 people shouting liberty and slogans 
against avril marched on the presidential palace in 
portauprince soldiers then fired in the air and beat 
demonstrators with billy clubs 
the will of the people is for avril to step down said a 
communique released thursday night by a coalition of 11 opposition 
parties that earlier had called on haitians to rise against the 
military government 
the marches in the capital and at least five provincial towns 
are reminiscent of demonstrations in november 1985 to protest the 
armys killing of three high school students in gonaives those 
protests led to the downfall of dictator jeanclaude duvalier who 
fled to exile in france in february 1986 
avril a former duvalier aide who came to power in september 
1988 in a coup led by rankandfile soldiers has been under 
increasing pressure from opposition groups to resign 
president bush mentioned haiti on thursday while attending a 
ceremony in fort myer va marking the us invasion of panama 
the revolution continues bush said the people have 
spoken in nicaragua when they speak in cuba and haiti our western 
hemisphere will be entirely within the compass of freedom 
the opposition in nicaragua backed by the united states 
defeated president daniel ortega and his ruling sandinistas in feb 
25 elections 
after taking power avril promised elections and reforms but 
shipped seven prodemocracy leaders into exile during a crackdown 
in january and arrested more than 50 opposition activists some of 
whom were beaten in custody 
although avril has promised to hold elections this year many 
haitians dont believe he can be trusted to hand over power to a 
civilian government 
in november 1987 the first free general elections since 
independence from france in 1804 were canceled after attackers 
protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters 
most haitian parties have vowed to boycott the elections unless 
avril first steps down they want a supreme court justice to 
replace him until voters choose a new leader 
students and government critics had called for a national day of 
mourning thursday in sympathy for the 11yearold girl shot by a 
soldier breaking up an antigovernment demonstration 
maj gen serge sainteloi the inspector general of the army 
said thursday night the girl was shot by a soldier from a passing 
vehicle but said an investigation would not be conducted because 
her parents buried her before an autopsy could be done

a moderate earthquake measuring 55 on the 
richter scale shook wide sections of southcentral alaska early 
today but there were no immediate reports of any damage or 
injuries officials said 
the quake was centered about 60 miles northwest of homer said 
alec medbery of the alaska tsunami warning center 
it was felt all the way from kodiak island to anchorage 
palmer and seward medbery said but it was too small for a 
tsunami a sea wave generated by a quake 
the 1964 good friday alaska earthquake that measured 85 on 
the richter scale generated large waves that devastated several 
coastal communities including valdez and killed 131 people as far 
south as oregon and hawaii 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 
times strong than one of 65 
an earthquake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage 4 
moderate damage 5 considerable damage and 6 severe damage

after more than a month of savage 
fighting gen michel aoun called today for peace talks with a 
rival christian warlord and with moslem leaders to settle lebanons 
civil war 
in an unusually conciliatory statement aoun said there will be 
no more clashes among christians or between christians and moslems 
he also dropped his rejection of an arab league plan intended to 
end 15 years of civil war 
in another development police said rival shiite moslem militias 
loyal to syria and iran clashed in south beirut and south lebanon 
no casualties were reported 
a police spokesman said syrian troops moved in and disengaged 
shiite zealots of the proiranian hezbollah or party of god and 
fighters of the mainstream shiite amal or hope militia in south 
beiruts seaside district of ouzai 
the firefight blocked traffic for 30 minutes along the coastal 
highway which links west beirut with south lebanon the spokesman 
said 
in south lebanons iqlim eltuffah province the two factions 
dueled intermittently with howitzers and mortars the spokesman 
said 
also israeli warplanes attacked a palestinian guerrilla base 
near the northern lebanese city of tripoli in the first raid in the 
region in nearly five years the israeli military said it made no 
mention of any casualties 
aoun described as selfdestructive the clashes between his 
troops and samir geageas lebanese forces militia which have 
killed more than 750 people since they broke out jan 31 aoun 
called on geagea to declare his readiness for dialogue so we can 
meet 
once two people manage to meet they can invite others aoun 
said in an invitation to nonchristian leaders to join in 
discussions for a settlement to the civil war his statement 
appeared in the daily annahar 
the arab league plan which shifts some political power to 
lebanons moslem majority was worked out by lebanese legislators 
in the saudi arabian town of taif in october 
abrogating the taif accord is not necessary to launch 
dialogue aoun told the independent daily though he added that 
he would like some amendments he did not elaborate 
he originally rejected the accord because it did not include a 
fixed timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun had rejected the parliamentary election of president elias 
hrawi who pledged to implement the peace plan aoun had refused 
hrawis order to step down as army commander and leave the 
presidential palace 
aouns 19000 army troops and samir geageas 6000member 
lebanese forces militia fought each other to a standstill in a 
power struggle for the 310square mile christian enclave before 
accepting a ceasefire on saturday 
police said the ceasefire was generally holding despite minor 
exchanges of sniper fire in some districts of east beirut 
a mediation committee of three independent christian figures was 
holding a series of meetings separately with aoun and geagea in an

president wojciech jaruzelski and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki of poland arrived in paris today to seek french 
backing for stronger border guarantees from a united germany 
in talks with president francois mitterrand the polish leaders 
are expected to stress their countrys desire to play a prominent 
role in discussions later this year between the two germanys and 
the four allied powers the united states france britain and the 
soviet union 
the poles have been particularly concerned about west german 
chancellor helmut kohls vague statements on the permanence of the 
border with poland a stance kohl changed only this week 
on thursday the west german parliament passed a resolution 
proposed by kohl stating that the two german nations should adopt 
declarations saying the polish people are assured that their 
right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us 
germans through territorial claims either now or in the future 
those declarations parliament said should be the basis for a 
future treaty signed by a newly united germany 
this change is a tiny step in the right direction 
jaruzelski was quoted as saying in an interview published today by 
the paris daily liberation 
there is a polish proverb that says that one spoonful of tar 
is enough to ruin a barrel of honey he said 
everybody knows that tactics must serve strategy and not the 
other way around it seems that the west german electoral tactic 
dominated the strategy of historic reconciliation between our 
peoples 
officials from the four allied powers are to meet for 
preliminary unification talks with the two germanys on wednesday 
poland has been pressing to participate in the talks 
the polish president noted in the newspaper interview that 
poland had participated in the potsdam conference in 1945 and was 
present during the talks that set the present oderneisse border 
between poland and east germany 
today the soviet union supports the polish demand to 
participate in the conference on german unity and i must say that 
it would be incomprehensible for us if france a traditional friend 
of poland did not share this position jaruzelski said 
todays trip marked the first joint foreign visit by jaruzelski 
a communist and mazowiecki a solidarity activist who became prime 
minister after the 1989 elections that catapulted a coaltion led by 
the trade union into power 
asked if the double visit had a special significance jaruzelski 
said it did we wanted in fact to make two points in this 
visit liberation quoted jaruzelski as saying 
on the international level to stress the importance poland 
attaches to the german question and on an internal level to show 
the very constructive character of political cohabitation in poland 
on all the essential questions

nationalist leader nelson mandela 
called on the international community today to provide funds to 
resettle thousands of exiles who plan to return to south africa 
we will need tremendous resources to find jobs and 
accomodations for thousands of exiles and political detainees 
still held in south african jails the african national congress 
leader said 
we rely on the international community particularly the 
african states to provide the required resources mandela added 
mandela 71 was the worlds bestknown political prisoner until 
south africa freed him last month and legalized the anc guerrilla 
group as a step toward possible whiteblack negotiations 
the anc estimates there are 15000 political exiles living 
throughout africa who may return to south africa now that the anc 
and several other antigovernment groups are legal 
mandela interrupted a visit to tanzania to fly to addis ababa 
for the speech in the ornate africa hall of the organization of 
african unity 
afterward he returned to tanzania to complete his scheduled 
sixday visit with a tour of anc guerrilla training camps in the 
east africa nation he will leave for sweden on sunday 
mandela said he had received military training in ethiopia 
before he was arrested in 1962 for illegally leaving south africa 
he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and 
treason the government commuted that sentence last month 
mandela plans to travel to sweden next week 
a spokesman for swedens foreign ministry larsolof lundberg 
said today that mandela has asked to cut two days off his planned 
weeklong visit 
he gave no reason for mandelas request but the swedish news 
agency tt said mandela was concerned with unrest in south africas 
black homelands and a warning from the whiteled south african 
government that it might intervene with emergency powers to end the 
violence 
more than 20 people were killed this week in clashes between 
homeland authorities and groups demanding reincorporation into 
south africa and in factional fights over local issues in black 
townships in south africa 
the anc named mandela deputy president last week making him the 
effective leader of the organization anc president oliver tambo 
once mandelas law partner in south africa entered a stockholm 
clinic in january after suffering a stroke mandela was expected to 
spend considerable time visiting tambo

two horses loose on a street were killed by a 
truck and a city crew was sent to remove the carcasses but the 
workers found that one horse had already been buried on the spot 
in a median strip 
believe me after 18 years in this business this is one of 
the most bizarre things ive ever seen ulysses ford head of the 
citys solid waste management department said friday 
to be honest with you it would be unlikely for anybody to do 
this i dont know why someone would do this he said i just 
cant imagine their purpose 
ron blackwell said that when he arrived at work thursday at an 
auto parts store he noticed a dead horse lying in the middle of the 
median on the street and a second dead horse across the street 
blackwell said he called the city health department and then the 
solid waste department 
he said he and coworkers next saw a crew show up with digging 
equipment in yellow trucks bearing round emblems 
they dug a hole and buried him and left blackwell said i 
mean this is a fullgrown horse itd stand 16 hands high at the 
shoulder ill tell you i aint never seen nothing like that 
before in my life 
they come out with equipment and dig a hole in the middle of 
this esplanade out here and bury that horse right in the middle of 
the street out here ive been in 48 states and three countries 
and i aint never seen not even in the uncivilized countries do 
they bury a horse in the middle of the road 
ford said some city departments not including his have yellow 
trucks with round emblems but he said no one has been able to 
determine who buried the horse 
there are several different public agencies that could have 
been involved state county or city he said a private 
contractor or utility company could also have performed the deed 
he said 
ford said his workers later removed the second horse to a 
landfill and his department is coordinating with the citys parks 
department to remove the buried horse 
dewey senegal said the horses were kept on his land in far 
southern houston and wandered into the road after someone 
apparently left a gate open

president bush knew a caller claiming to be 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani might be an impostor but spoke 
with him on the off chance it might signal a breakthrough for 
us hostages the white house said today 
the presidents feeling was what if its real i want the 
american people to know and the families of the hostages to know 
that i am willing to check out every possibility said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater conceded that the phone conversation that occurred 
last month was an embarrassment since it turned to be a hoax but 
he added this phone call is just another reminder of the fact 
that we will pursue every lead we can get 
he also said the episode reflects the frustration the 
administration faces in its efforts to find ways to press for the 
release of the eight us and 10 other western hostages being held 
in lebanon 
fitzwater said the administration still does not know who 
initiated the hoax and could not rule out the possibility that it 
originated within a faction of the iranian government 
bush brushed off reporters questions about the phone call 
during an event in the rose garden declaring said it all it 
apparently was a reference to statements by fitzwater and other 
administration officials 
meanwhile rafsanjani said in a sermon broadcast on tehran radio 
that irans stature in the world is so high that the strongest 
power in the world and the greatest power on earth is striving to 
find an opening with your executive leader even through telephone 
wires 
can it be that such a global power with all its intelligence 
capabilities talks to a person it cannot identify he asked 
this is a strange occurrence 
this shows the united states very much needs to talk to iran 
but with gods grace it is deprived of this blessing he said 
now we must wait for explanations and witness another irangate 
in the making god willing rafsanjani said referring to the 
illfated effort by the reagan administration to trade arms for the 
release of hostages 
fitzwater asked about rafsanjanis statement said it 
reflects the difficulty of the situation one day we hear 
moderate points of view the next day we hear antagonistic ones 
so our position remains steadfast we want to do everything we 
can to get the hostages out the president will talk to anyone any 
time fitzwater said 
he and other white house officials said the bizarre chain of 
events began when a man identifying himself as an iranian 
government official called the white house to say rafsanjani wanted 
to talk to bush about us hostages held in lebanon 
fitzwater said today that in view of the unorthodox manner 
iran has used for communicating with the west in the past any 
communication from the leadership of iran has to be treated 
differently 
this call came in it was suspicious in origin fitzwater 
said 
officials said there were two calls the initial one and a 
second one during which bush talked with the impostor 
fitzwater said bush was willing to make this call on the 
offchance that it might be real fitzwater later was vague on 
whether the second call was placed or received by the white house 
saying he didnt want to get into such details 
the initial call came to national security adviser brent 
scowcroft white house aides said 
the episode was first reported thursday by cbs news 
eight americans including terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press and 10 other westerners are 
being held hostage in lebanon 
the bush administration contends rafsanjanis government has 
influence with those holding the hostages 
the disclosure of the hoax came amid a flurry of recent reports 
on hostagerelated developments however us officials have said 
they are unable to cite any actual movement toward freeing the 
hostages 
although he was tricked once bush would do the same thing again 
if he thought it would help win the release of the hostages his 
spokesman said 
if a call came through at some future point that we believed 
was real he would take it fitzwater said the president has 
made it known hes willing to talk to iran at any time and the 
ball is in their court so its up to them to signal a willingness 
to talk 
fitzwater said the administration has let rafsanjani know 
through diplomatic channels as well as publicly that were 
willing to talk whenever theyre ready and they have come back and 
said were not ready 
fitzwater declined to go into details of bushs conversation 
with the unknown caller 
cbs said the president repeated us policy that goodwill will 
beget goodwill but there could be no quid pro quo for us 
hostages cbs said

a vice minister of railways has been ousted for 
allegedly taking bribes becoming one of the highestranking 
officials toppled in a nationwide campaign against corruption the 
government said friday 
luo yunguang who had been vice minister since 1986 was the 
fifth railways ministry official accused of corruption in the past 
six months 
the official xinhua news agency said luo ignored corruption by 
his aides and personally accepted a gold ring a refrigerator and 
the equivalent of 465 in bribes it did not say what he did in 
return for the bribes 
he has returned the money and the ring it said and prosecutors 
are looking into the case he has not yet been legally charged 
luo seriously discredited the reputation of the railways 
ministry and had a vile political influence state tv said 
top leaders ordered a nationwide offensive against official 
corruption last summer after watching student prodemocracy 
protesters win massive public support in large part because of 
their demands for clean government 
in recent years giftgiving has become an essential part of 
most official applications with bribes ranging from a bottle of 
liquor for a scarce ticket to cash for a passport or an apartment 
the government set up special hotlines for reporting corruption 
and offered leniency to people who confessed by years end it said 
it had received reports of more than 216000 cases and had dealt 
with more than a quarter of them 
however many chinese remain cynical about the government 
cleanup efforts noting that most of those charged are lower level 
officials and that no children of high officials have been charged 
even though several are engaged in questionable trade activities 
other high officials charged include hainan gov liang xiang 
accused of helping family members in illegal profiteering schemes 
and the vice chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region 
tohti sabir accused of taking bribes liang is widely believed to 
have been targeted because he was an ally of ousted communist party 
chief zhao ziyang 
xinhua said the state council chinas cabinet ordered luo to 
hand over all his illegal income and will continue to investigate 
his activities the party is conducting its own investigation it 
said 
four railways ministry officials including the director of the 
ministrys transportation department and his three aides were 
accused in october of taking bribes to allocate rail cars for 
transporting goods the demand for cars far exceeds supply

pay for expensive restorations instead of less expensive repairs

developing or selling their properties 
the area runs from riverside drive between west 85th street and 
west 95th street over one block east to west end avenue between 
west 87th street and west 94th street it also includes some parts

the pentagon today announced plans to expand 
its role in the bush administrations war on drugs by deploying a 
wide array of warships aircraft and communications equipments in 
the atlantic pacific and caribbean 
we will act swiftly methodically and in accordance with our 
nations laws and traditions defense secretary dick cheney said 
in a prepared statement 
stephen m duncan cheneys coordinator of drug enforcement 
policy told a news conference the plan as developed by regional 
commanders would cost nearly twice the 450 million appropriated 
by congress for pentagon antidrug efforts this year he said the 
services would have to cough up out of their hide the extra 
funds 
the administration has asked congress to approve 12 billion in 
pentagon spending on the drug war next year 
duncan said the new strategy does not give the defense 
department any new missions in the druginterdiction effort but 
amounts to substantially more of the same kinds of actions the 
military has been performing in recent years 
were not going to become a law enforcement agency duncan 
said 
duncan outlined the following plans for increasing military 
action in the drug war 
the us atlantic command this year will use four or five naval 
ships daily expressly for tracking and stopping the flow of drugs 
in international waters in the caribbean and atlantic it 
previously had none dedicated to this use it also will increase 
its use of airborne warning and control systems or awacs aircraft 
the atlantic commands use of ships in the drug war will 
increase this year by 78 percent over 1989 as measured by days at 
sea aircraft use as measured by flight hours will increase by 
219 percent duncan said 
the us atlantic and pacific commands each plan to use more 
than eight classes of aircraft and six classes of ships for the 
druginterdiction strategy 
the aircraft include e2 hawkeyes p3 orions f4 phantoms and 
f14 tomcats ships include destroyers frigates guided missile 
frigates guided missile destroyers aircraft carriers patrol 
hydrofoils and a variety of amphibious and logistic support ships 
the north atlantic aerospace defense command will use a network 
of 44 ground radars designed to warn of high altitude penetrations 
of us airspace it also will increase its patrol of the us 
southern border and coasts by using awacs aircraft and 50 
interceptor alert aircraft positioned at 25 locations nationwide 
all pentagon antidrug operations will be coordinated by the 
forces command at fort mcpherson ga 
absent from the list of military actions is a proposal to 
operate a us naval flotilla off the coast of colombia in search 
of drug smugglers in the wake of the us invasion of panama 
colombian leaders balked at the proposal which they said amounted 
to a blockade president bush then withdrew the plan

italian communists who have resolved to 
create a new party focused friday on how to achieve that goal and 
avoid the perils it poses for their unity 
party leader achille occhetto has the votes he needs at the 
partys extraordinary congress for the approval of his proposal to 
revamp the party a move that is expected to lead to a change of 
its name and the elimination of its hammer and sickle symbol 
but former party leader alessandro natta one of the old 
guard communists who led the campaign against creating a new 
party cautioned occhetto and his followers not to take steps that 
would split the wests largest communist party 
those who oppose the change will not estrange themselves from 
the party said natta but neither will they tolerate being put 
aside 
although occhetto controls almost 67 percent of the 1092 
delegates he still needs to negotiate with the impassioned 
minority that fought against his proposal 
occhettos proposal was sprurred by the collapse of communism in 
eastern europe and by his partys steady decline in both membership 
and electoral strength the communists nearly came to power in 1976 
when they won 34 percent of the vote but they dropped to about 27 
percent in the last parliamentary elections in 1987 
occhetto hopes a new party formation can help reverse the 
membership and electoral slides bring the party into the 
mainstream of european socialism and challenge the domination of 
the christian democrats and their allies in italy by uniting the 
countrys fractured political left 
but the entire plan could backfire if occhetto only succeeds in 
splitting his party of 14 million members his opposition has come 
from the old guard emotionally tied to ther name and symbol and 
from young members who want a more militant party one that would 
for example oppose italys membership in nato 
i have said that it would not displease me if ours remained 
the only party in the world to call itself communist natta told 
the delegates 
the fight involves political questions and the most relevant 
of these is the fate of the party a change is possible but there 
is no need to lower our flag argued natta 
we in the minority believe that the italian communist party 
has in itself the reasons the resources and the capacity for a 
renewal that will allow it to confront in this historic phase the 
demands for the struggle for democracy and for the alternative to 
the christian democrats natta said later 
while the plan to revamp the party is assured the shape of that 
new party and its name are uncertain that will be left to the 
party leadership to be elected sunday who then will present their 
proposals to another party congress for approval 
the battle lines between occhetto and his opponents at the 
congress are drawn in committee rooms where delegates are 
considering the makeup of the leadership that will draft the 
proposals for that next congress 
occhetto and his allies want to create a new executive body in 
the party to streamline the decisionmaking his opponents who 
have seen their numbers increase in the 300member central 
committee want to keep the party structures as they are 
one possible compromise would give occhetto the new executive 
body but one in which the no forces would still have a voice 
occhettos allies repeatedly have stressed to the congress they 
want to avoid any split in the party but that they understand the 
risks and want the direction of the new party to be determined by 
all the members 
we must decide to assume the responsibility of a courageous 
exceptional political initiative none of us underestimates the 
difficulties and the risks said giorgio napolitano an old guard 
communist who has supported occhetto 
in building the new party said napolitano we must do our 
work but in a free and open way we need the support of everyone

when people have too much cash on hand they take 
it to a bank but what does a bank with too much money do 
new england banks with money to burn send those megabucks to the 
federal reserve bank of boston 
the reserve banks primary function is to be a banker for other 
new england banks lending money to those that need it and storing 
funds for those with excess cash said edward a romkey an 
assistant vice president of the bank it also detects filthy lucre 
worn and dirty bills and takes them out of circulation 
new england banks usually have too much cash during the ski 
season summer vacations and christmas he said 
any time currency use is up counterfeiting is up 
counterfeiters have seasons too romkey said he said the bank 
sends 200 to 300 fake bills daily to the secret service 
the cash that arrives from new england banks is fed into eight 
currency verification and counting system machines which process 
72000 greenbacks hourly 
the machines scan the back of each bill much like a supermarket 
scanner reads a bar code and decide whether it is real and in good 
enough condition to go back into circulation clean bills get 
counted and shrinkwrapped 
worn torn and soiled bills about 1 million worth daily are 
shredded into confetti and handed out to bank visitors

an unprecedented statement by president bush 
opposing the settlement of soviet jewish refugees in east jerusalem 
could make it more difficult for the israeli cabinet to approve 
us proposals for mideast negotiations this weekend 
by coupling east jerusalem with the west bank and gaza as 
offlimits to settlers bush appeared to question israels 
retention of the predominantly arab part of the city 
all week us officials have danced around bushs statement 
insisting there is no change in us policy on jerusalem or on the 
west bank and gaza they voiced approval of jews living in both the 
predominantly jewish and mostly arab parts of the city 
but many questions were left unanswered in fact new questions 
were raised 
a white house statement on jerusalem on monday for instance 
said us policy backs the right of jews as well as others to 
live there in the context of a negotiated settlement 
that suggests jews who have lived in jerusalem for more than 
3000 years need arab acquiescence to remain in the older part of 
the city 
on friday white house press secretary marlin fitzwater having 
tried all week to persuade reporters there was no change in policy 
admitted there are some words you cant use in describing this 
policy and some words you can use 
the spokesman insisted there is no special motivation behind 
the presidents words there was no special purpose or attention 
there 
a twicepostponed showdown in the israeli cabinet is now set for 
sunday when the cabinet takes up a formula by secretary of state 
james a baker iii that has split the conservative likud and the 
dovish labor parties 
bakers goal is to have israelis meet with palestinians in cairo 
as the first step toward settlement without a dialogue between 
israelis and palestinians we can never move forward to peace he 
said tuesday 
bakers formula tries to bridge differences between israel on 
the one hand and egypt and the palestine liberation organization 
on the other it would permit a palestinian arab resident of east 
jerusalem and one or two palestinians deported by israel from the 
west bank to participate in the talks 
but israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and other leaders of 
the likud coalition are worried that might clear a way for the plo 
to dominate the agenda 
labor on the other hand is impatient to proceed with 
negotiations 
amid this political debate first baker and then bush made 
statements that stirred controversy in israel and may have hardened 
likuds resistance to the us formula 
baker told a house subcommittee last week the administration 
wanted assurances a us 400 million housing loan guarantee would 
not be used to settle soviet jewish refugees on the west bank 
only about 100 of the thousands of jews who have poured into 
israel have been settled on the west bank but their presence is 
taken by the arabs as evidence that israel does not intend to 
relinquish the territory 
bakers thrust at shamirs settlement program irritated the 
prime minister and members of both likud and labor were upset by 
bakers statement at the same hearing that there is no evidence plo 
chairman yasser arafat is violating his december 1988 renunciation 
of terrorism 
then at a news conference saturday in palm springs calif the 
president weighed in with a statement opposing new settlements on 
the west bank or in east jerusalem 
his intention may have been to discourage israel from expanding 
east jerusalem to its suburbs and to settle soviet jews there 
that would have been consistent with longstanding us policy 
against further jewish settlements on the west bank as an obstacle 
to mideast negotiations 
but bush by linking east jerusalem and the west bank may have 
had something else in mind that he considers east jerusalem 
occupied territory and jews living there as settlers as well 
the president had not been asked about east jerusalem and his 
statement upset israelis who see the predominantly arab part of 
their capital and the west bank as completely different 
many israelis would surrender most of the west bank as part of a 
peace agreement with the arabs but very few would be willing to 
relinquish any part of their capital 
in more than two decades of us diplomacy jerusalem and the 
west bank have been approached as separate issues jerusalem is 
touchier and american presidents and secretaries of state have 
tried to keep their distance usually by saying ambiguously that 
the city should never be divided again and not saying whether 
israel ought to retain exclusive control over jerusalem 
bushs statement is a problem then 
the white house and state department tried on wednesday to 
soften its impact by asserting support for jews living in jerusalem 
and insisting us policy on the city and on the west bank had not 
changed 
maybe it has and maybe it hasnt that depends on what bush has 
in mind 
but gaining israels approval sunday of bakers formula for 
negotiations is now tougher than ever

leaders of venezuala and spain urged 
vice president dan quayle today to press for rapid disbanding of 
the contras saying nicaraguas sandinista government should be 
trusted to give up power us officials said 
quayle stated the us position that the contras should disband 
but that their security must be ensured first said a us official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in what one official called kind of a rolling summit on 
nicaragua quayles talks with venezuelan president carlos andres 
perez came between perezs meeting yesterday with incoming 
nicaragaun president violeta chamorro and saturdays arrival in 
caracas of outgoing president daniel ortega 
they are disacussing how a peaceful transfer of power can occur 
with the sandinistas still in control of the 70000man nicaraguan 
army and the contra rebels massed at the honduran border 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez also met with quayle and 
perez today he was in venezuela en route to chile more talks on 
nicaragua were expected when gonzalez takes ortega and perez and 
costa rican president oscar arias to sundays chilean inaugural 
the us official said 
quayles aides had said the perez talks would focus on president 
bushs push to gain acceptance for the usinstalled governmment 
in panama but the mornings talks were solely on nicaragua 
us officials said perez has been helping diplomatically to 
influence other south american nations to accept the government of 
panamanian president guillermo endara 
perez following endaras march 1 announcement that he would 
hold a vote on the panamanian constitution said he would normalize 
relations with panama venezuela was joined by colombia argentina 
peru and ecuador in moving to accept endaras government 
the countries that remain to be convinced include brazil 
uruguay mexico and chile 
quayle whose trip also will include attendance at inaugurations 
sunday in chile and thursday in brazil left shortly after daybreak 
today from andrews air force base outside of washington 
in briefing foreign reporters on the eve of his departure 
quayle offered no specifics on what the united states can do to 
help the latin countries with their massive debt and inflation 
problems 
he said he wanted to hear ideas on trade and economic 
development from those countries heads of state 
its very important to solicit their ideas quayle said 
at times the united states gets accused perhaps justifiably so 
of lecturing im not visiting latin america to lecture im 
visiting latin america to listen to get their ideas 
he said the administration is prepared to turn its attention 
more to economic affairs in the hemisphere now that democratic 
elections have sparked political reform in country after country 
previously ruled by dictators 
political development has been successful in the hemisphere 
but we have not been as successful as wed like on economic 
development quayle told reporters 
brazils 115 billion foreign debt is the largest in the 
developing world argentina is beset by demonstrations and strikes 
resulting from its 8000 percent inflation rate 
there has been little progress except in mexico on the bush 
administrations socalled brady plan to ease latin american debt 
by getting commercial banks to forgive outstanding loans 
the other goal of quayles trip seeking acceptance of the 
panamanian government installed when the us invasion toppled gen 
manuel antonio noriega still faces resistance both chile and 
brazil refused to invite panamanian representatives to their 
inaugurations 
in brazil it is likely that the new government will examine 
the matter in a new light said one brazilian diplomat referring 
to the upcoming inauguration of fernando collor de mello 
sen edward kennedy dmass is accompanying quayle as part of 
the us delegation to the chile inauguration of patricio aylwin 
kennedy was a leading critic of human rights violations under 
outgoing chilean president gen agosto pinochet 
quayle will meet with pinochet who insisted on retaining 
control of the countrys 60000man army even though he will not be 
president 
nicaraguas outgoing president daniel ortega defeated in feb 
25 elections by the usbacked candidate violeta chamorro also 
plans to attend the chile inaugural while us officials have 
refused to meet with ortega or representatives of his marxist 
regime the vice president now would have no objections to such a 
meeting said beckwith however he added that nicaraguan officials 
had not sought a meeting

lithuanias newly elected lawmakers pressed on 
toward a showdown with moscow caucusing friday on how to take the 
reins of power after the declaration of independence expected by 
parliament this weekend 
a secession vote by the lithuanian supreme soviet would confront 
mikhail s gorbachev with what could be his greatest crisis the 
breaking away of one of the 15 soviet republics with the 
possibility of the rest of the multinational empire following suit 
moscow is menacing us we hope its only with words said 
anderus kubilus secretary of sajudis lithuanias proindependence 
movement we dont think there will be an acute economic 
blockade it wouldnt be profitable for them either economically 
or in terms of international opinion but we dont know 
however in comments reported wednesday by official radio 
vilnius gorbachev appeared to accept lithuanias right to secede 
although cautioning that the once independent state on the baltic 
sea would have to pay 34 billion in compensation for factories 
built and money invested during a halfcentury of soviet rule 
with the legislatures opening session scheduled for saturday 
night secession activists reported from the capital of vilnius 
that the stance of lithuanian president and communist party leader 
algirdas brazauskas was still unclear 
as chairman of the 141seat chamber brazauskas conceivably 
could stave off immediate confrontation with the kremlin by using 
his office to delay debate on the secession issue which is 
expected to begin sunday 
his position is that we should act step by step that theres 
no need to do it hastily alvydas medalinskas sajudis executive 
director said by telephone he said brazauskas most recent 
appearance on staterun lithuanian tv wednesday showed his position 
has not changed 
kubilus however noted that the presidium of the supreme 
soviet or legislature that brazauskas heads has included the 
independence issue on the legislative agenda which he took to be a 
sign of tacit support from the lithuanian leader who masterminded 
his communist partys december declaration of independence from the 
soviet party that gorbachev heads 
forcing the pace the governing council of sajudis declared the 
independence issue cannot be delayed and called on the incoming 
legislature to restore the sovereignty lost in 1940 when red army 
tanks rolled in 
the statement issued after the sajudis council met thursday 
carried enormous clout since candidates supported by the 
grassroots nationalist movement won at least twothirds of the 
seats in the supreme soviet in elections that began feb 24 
in response to a call from sajudis election committees moved up 
the dates of runoffs so the new legislature could convene before 
the national congress of peoples deputies which is to meet in 
moscow on monday can confer vastly greater presidential powers on 
gorbachev that activists in the soviet republics say would imperil 
their campaigns for sovereignty 
the lithuanian legislature will be asked to reaffirm the 1918 
act that declared the west virginiasized state independent on 
feb 7 lawmakers voided lithuanias 1940 incorporation into the 
soviet union calling it illegal so the incoming parliament will 
vote on a restoration of statehood kubilus said 
they will also be asked to restore the 1938 constitution that 
was swept away by josef stalins kremlin in favor of a sovietstyle 
law 
anticipating the vote a commission of newly elected deputies 
representing the kgb police and lithuanian lawyers met friday to 
work out proposals on how to handle defense law enforcement and 
security in an independent lithuania medalinskas said 
there are big preparations under way to assume power said 
kubilus 
a commission of the outgoing legislature has prepared proposals 
for an independent economy but medalinskas said further 
negotiations on that score were expected with moscow 
in remarks reported by the official tass news agency lithuanian 
economist bronislovas zaikauskas an adviser to the republics 
government said his homeland poor in natural resources could 
exploit its location on the soviet unions western fringe to become 
a trampoline for western firms seeking entry to the soviet 
market 
official soviet statistics show lithuania imports 25 billion 
more in goods from the other soviet republics than what it exports 
but zaikauskas pointed out the illogic of a staterun economy where 
the most industrially developed soviet republics lithuania and 
its baltic neighbors of estonia and latvia run a debt with the 
rest of the country 
opposition to the independence declaration from ethnic 
minorities living in lithuania was likely but medalinskas said 
there have been no recent statements from the ethnic russianled 
intermovement or a rump faction of the communist party still loyal 
to moscow 
ethnic lithuanians make up 80 percent of the republics 37 
million population with russians totaling 9 percent and poles 7 
percent 
independence will also be on the agenda in estonia this weekend 
as the socalled estonian congress convenes sunday in tallinn the 
republics capital to discuss negotiations with moscow 
the 499member nongovernmental body represents people who lived 
in estonia before the 1940 soviet takeover and their descendents 
the delegates will cooperate with estonias legislature on 
independence and are determined to press moscow for the soonest 
possible settlement of the issue said tonis avikson a spokesman 
for the estonian peoples front

oliver north took the stand as the leadoff 
witness at the irancontra trial of john poindexter today and 
grudgingly admitted he ran a secret contra resupply operation on 
orders from poindexter and others 
north testifying as a hostile witness for the 
prosecution acknowledged that he controlled the covert contra 
supply operation and said he never acted on his own 
at no time as you were running your operation you never 
tried to conceal or hide what you were doing from either admiral 
poindexter or robert mcfarlane prosecutor dan webb asked 
i did not the retired marine lieutenant colonel said 
were you ever trying to direct that operation on you own 
independent or your superiors webb asked 
never north replied 
didnt you keep them apprised of all of your contrarelated 
activities webb asked 
yes north said 
prosecutors called north to the stand to butress their 
contention that he worked with poindexter to cover up the 
irancontra affair poindexter is charged with conspiracy two 
counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements to cover up norths military assistance and fundraising 
for the contras and us knowledge of a 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles from israel to iran 
on thursday poindexters lawyer said the former national 
security adviser may be guilty of bad memory but did not 
deliberately lie to congress about secret arms shipments to iran 
today north initially denied that he controlled the contra 
resupply operation in which retired air force maj gen richard 
secord played a key role 
to say that secord worked under my direction would say a major 
general is working for a lieutenant colonel and i dont think 
thats accurate north testified 
webb then handed north a copy of testimony he gave at his own 
trial last year in which north was asked who gave secord his orders 
i suppose i did north replied at the time 
asked again by webb whether he had run the operation north 
replied 
i gave him a lot of requests and if you want to call it 
direction and guidance i guess thats what were stuck with 
us district court judge harold greene at one point referred to 
north as a hostile witness and gave webb permission to ask 
leading questions of the former white house aide 
quoting from norths earlier testimony at his trial webb asked 
if the ball had been passed to north in terms of taking care of 
the contras needs after congress prohibited the cia from providing 
it 
i dont recall those specific words north said but later 
conceding he had said words to that effect 
norths role as overseer of the contras needs beginning in late 
1984 took place while poindexter was the deputy to robert 
mcfarlane who was national security adviser at the time 
was admiral poindexter one of your superiors asked webb 
in that general time frame he was one of the people who 
assigned me to assist the contras replied north 
defense attorney richard beckler has denied that poindexter 
engaged in a criminal coverup of the irancontra affair declaring 
that he was acting under president reagans orders 
beckler said congress was fully informed of norths secret 
contra resupply network and that poindexter labored to provide 
congress the story of the reagan administrations iran initiative 
once it became public during november 1986 
why would anybody have to hide and deceive asked beckler 
the answer is that poindexter didnt have to hide the answer is 
there was nothing illegal 
earlier thursday webb said john poindexter and oliver north 
decided to rewrite the history of the irancontra affair through 
a conspiracy of coverup deception and concealment 
poindexter and north tried to cover up the 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran and the diversion of profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels to avoid tarnishment of the reagan administration webb 
said 
but beckler told the jury poindexter simply forgot when he gave 
incorrect information to members of the house and senate 
intelligence committees about his involvement in the november 1985 
hawks shipment 
the thennational security adviser told the congressional 
committees that he found out about the delivery in january 1986 
when in fact he had known of the shipment at the time it occurred 
after 30 years in the us navy and the white house they want 
to nail him on a fiveweek mistake for obstruction and making 
false statements to congress beckler told the jury nearly 
shouting 
hours after making the alleged false statements poindexter tore 
up a politically embarrassing presidential paper that depicted us 
involvement in iran arms sales as a straight armsforhostages 
deal the december 1985 finding retroactively authorized the 
november 1985 ciaassisted shipment of hawks from israel to iran 
sometimes you do things to protect the president beckler 
said when you work for the president of the united states part 
of your job is to protect the president 
what was driving this man was not a conspiracy but the 
orders of the president of the united states said beckler he 
met with him sometimes seven days a week sometimes four five and 
six times a day and he was carrying out the policies of the united 
states and that is what this case is about it is not about 
criminality 
north met with members of congress on aug 6 1986 and denied 
assisting the contras militarily poindexter later sent a message 
telling his aide well done 
prosecutor webb told jurors that north lied at poindexters 
direction during the aug 6 meeting webb said poindexter later 
congratulated north on lies that the prosecutor said worked like 
a charm

a human skull was carried on the recent 
mission of the space shuttle atlantis to help scientists determine 
how much radiation penetrates astronauts heads when they are in 
space 
the skull owner and gender undetermined had been carried into 
orbit once previously and will also be placed aboard the shuttle 
discovery when it is launched next month the national aeronautics 
and space administration said 
the industry magazine aviation week and space technology said 
the phantom head as it is officially designated was mounted on 
the right wall of the shuttle middeck near the lower end of an 
astronaut sleeping bag 
for the experiment the skull was sliced apart filled with more 
than 100 instruments reassembled and covered with a plastic 
material formulated to act like human skin 
researchers needed an actual human skull to obtain the best data 
on how much space radiation penetrates the head according to 
aviation week 
the magazine quoted a johnson space center document as saying 
that it is anticipated that a full torso will be flown in future 
shuttle missions to determine how much of a radiation dose the 
body gets during space flight 
the tests are for use in planning extended space station 
missions and lengthy stays on the moon and mars 
aviation week said the skull was provided by the air force and 
came from someone who had willed it to science researchers assumed 
it was from a woman because of its small size

campaign the sandinistas made no distinction between state and 
party resources she said 
now they are trying to provide a legal sanction for their

many state and local officials arent buying president bushs 
proposed national transportation policy which would shift more of 
the cost to states one critic called the proposal all flash and 
no cash 
the critics are demanding release of billions of dollars from 
the highway and aviation trust funds 
the states are going to have to do their part and we are but 
the federal government has got to do its part its got to be a 
partnership said massachusetts gov michael dukakis who lost to 
bush in the 1988 presidential election 
but some hailed it for giving the states greater freedom 
the presidents policy offers excellent promise for future 
transportation decisionmaking and gives states more flexibility 
over control of federally assisted projects and it encourages use 
of innovative financing by the states said illinois gov james 
r thompson a republican 
the administration plan moving america into the 21st 
century calls for more toll roads local gas taxes user fees 
private investments competition deregulation research into 
futuristic systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as 
increased attention to safety and protection of the environment 
the policy unveiled thursday by bush and transportation 
secretary samuel skinner contains no strategy to increase federal 
funding beyond whats already in the presidents budget 
thompson said he agreed with user fees but added that it is 
essential that the users have confidence that their fees are going 
to be used promptly for improvements to the transportation 
system as a result i emphasize again the need to spend down trust 
fund balances as quickly as practical to put user fee revenue to 
work on transportation projects 
arnold oliver engineerdirector of texas department of 
highways and public transportation said his agency is very 
concerned about shifting the financial burden 
were already stretched to the limit oliver said 
the president had a chance to hit a home run for 
transportation by agreeing to spend some of the 23 billion already 
collected in the highway and aviation trust funds but being held 
hostage to reduce the federal deficit he missed the ball on that 
one but hopefully the game isnt over said james pitz director 
of the michigan department of transportation 
hal rives commissioner of the georgia department of 
transportation said 66 billion is spent on highways across the 
country each year and the federal government only pays 12 billion 
were already paying the larger share its time for the 
federal government to back up what they need with federal money 
and they have the money he said referring to the trust funds 
based on taxes on fuel and airline tickets 
robert r kiley chairman of new york citys metropolitan 
transportation authority also blasted the proposed reduction of 
federal spending on transportation 
reading this policy you would never know we have serious 
congestion and infrastructure decay problems which need to be 
boldly addressed kiley said like the national education and 
national drug policies this is another case of all flash and no 
cash 
washington state officials said the proposal could mean higher 
taxes will be needed to fund transportation improvements in the 
state 
washington state lawmakers last week approved a 11 billion tax 
increase over five years for transportation including a 4cent 
gastax increase this year and another penny in 1991 at 22 cents a 
gallon washingtons tax will be among the highest in the nation 
in massachusetts dukakis repeated his call for the legislature 
to increase the states gasoline tax now at 11 cents a gallon one 
of the nations lowest 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter has backed increased taxes for 
transportation and the state gasoline tax has been raised from 14 
to 21 cents per gallon over the past six years said his spokesman 
ken renner 
at the same time tennesseans have been paying federal taxes 
that go into the highway trust fund and the aviation trust fund and 
the governor believes it is time that the money in these funds is 
spent for the purposes for which it is intended renner said

gen michel aoun appealed friday for an 
end to lebanons 15yearold civil war making a conciliatory move 
to moslem leaders and a christian warlord he has tried to crush in 
more than a month of battles 
aoun also dropped his outright opposition to the peace accord 
and power sharing agreement worked out by lebanons parliament in 
october 
police said a weekold ceasefire between aouns 19000 troops 
and the 6000member lebanese forces militia of samir geagea was 
holding despite minor exchanges of sniper fire 
at least 750 people were killed and 2089 wounded during the 
inconclusive showdown between the two forces for mastery of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
in another development police said rival shiite moslem militias 
loyal to syria and iran clashed in south beirut and south lebanon 
but there were no reports of casualties 
the police spokesman said syrian troops moved in and disengaged 
shiite zealots of the proiranian hezbollah or party of god and 
fighters of the mainstream shiite amal militia in south beiruts 
seaside district of ouzai 
in south lebanons iqlim eltuffah province the two factions 
dueled with howitzers and mortars the police spokesman said 
the shiite clashes came two days after a beirut firefight 
between the two groups that left two people dead and three wounded 
the two factions have been fighting sporadically for more than 
two years for dominance among shiites the nations largest sect 
the war between the two shiite militias has left 1030 people 
dead and 3046 wounded 
also friday israeli warplanes attacked a palestinian guerrilla 
base near the northern lebanese city of tripoli in the first raid 
in the region in nearly five years the israeli military said 
a guerrilla group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command said six israeli warplanes rocketed one 
of its naval bases killing two guerrillas and wounding a lebanese 
farmer 
the bases hit served as launching points for attacks on 
israel by the guerrilla group the israeli military said 
the military did not point to a specific attack blamed on 
jibrils militia while israel frequently attacks guerrilla bases 
in south lebanon in retaliation for attacks on or near the 
israelilebanese border the raid in northern lebanon was unusual 
it was the eighth air raid this year by israeli jets against 
targets in lebanon 
aoun in an unusually conciliatory statement to the newspaper 
annahar said there will be no more clashes among christians or 
between christians and moslems 
aoun told annahar he wanted dialogue with everyone to find 
a settlement to more than a month of clashes between his troops and 
geageas militia 
he stressed there will be no more clashes in the christian 
enclave or along the areas separating christian territory with the 
moslem sectors 
the general also dropped his rejection of an arab league peace 
plan brokered last year in the saudi arabian city of taif 
abrogating the taif accord is not necessary to launch a 
dialogue aoun said 
he did call however for unspecified amendments to the plan 
aoun originally rejected the accord because it did not include a 
timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from lebanon 
aouns army and geageas militia fought each other to a 
standstill before accepting a ceasefire on march 3 called by a 
mediation committee of three independent christian figures 
the committee said friday it was holding a series of meetings 
with aoun geagea and maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
to consolidate the ceasefire and move into addressing the 
political reasons for the crisis it did not elaborate 
aoun and geagea are maronites the catholic community that has 
dominated political life in lebanon since its independence from 
france in 1943 
aoun described the inconclusive intrachristian showdown as 
self destructive and called on geagea to declare his 
readiness for dialogue so we can meet 
once two people manage to meet they can invite others aoun 
said the statement was considered to be an invitation to moslem 
leaders to meet with him and discuss a settlement to the civil war 
moslems have been demanding political reforms giving them an 
equal share in lebanons political life 
the taif accord called for distributing government and 
parliamentary seats equally among moslems and christians

the east german army has been facing a drain on human resources 
and declining morale and readiness since the hardline communist 
leadership fell in october and borders to the west were opened 
according to military sources and western officials 
hoffmann described western reports that his troops had lost as 
many as 80000 soldiers or 50 percent of the active force as 
exaggerated contending instead that between 500 and 1000 
mainly young soldiers had deserted 
he stressed that most were doing their duty conscientiously but 
added the number of young people leaving this land is high and 
that includes soldiers 
he said troops worries about their future had prompted many to 
opt for migration to west germany 
the question they always ask is whats going to happen 
to us he said hoffmann added he was concerned about reports he 
had received that recruits had burned their military id cards and 
refused to take part in exercises 
we cant say were totally satisfied when soldiers are 
demonstrating and refusing to carry out orders a new motivation 
must be built up hoffmann said 
other defense ministry sources have put the number of deserters 
in the thousands 
according to hoffmann 130000 soldiers were in active military 
service with an extra 12000 performing special duties in the 
economy and health services also ailing since the communist ouster 
he said 28000 soldiers who had taken planned retirement made 
up the difference to what officially is a 170000man fighting 
force 
army officials from east germanys warsaw pact allies had 
privately expressed concern about the reports of flagging 
discipline but had made no official complaints 
as the germanys move toward unification hoffmann said he 
supported a united germanys membership in a european security 
system that would embrace east and west and surpass the warsaw pact 
and nato as military alliances 
the west insists that a single germany adhere to the north 
atlantic treaty organization while the communistled east german 
interim government backed by the kremlin has ruled out nato 
membership 
hoffmann a member of the communist party who is likely to be 
replaced as minister after march 18 elections vote in a new 
government and parliament said he looked forward to working with 
what would probably be his civilian successor 
he said east germany could replace conscription with a voluntary 
professional army and recommended both german armies should 
increase cooperation in coordinating activities such as disaster 
cleanups and other emergency operations

president bushs phone conversation with an 
impostor claiming to be irans president was a little 
embarrassing but underscored his commitment to winning the 
release of us hostages in lebanon bushs spokesman said friday 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush believed 
the contact purportedly from hashemi rafsanjani was probably a 
hoax but decided to involve himself anyway on the chance that it 
wasnt 
the presidents feeling was what if its real and i want 
the american people to know and the families of the hostages to 
know that i am willing to check out every possibility 
fitzwater said 
a caller identifying himself as an iranian official phoned the 
white house several weeks ago and asserted that the iranian 
president wanted to discuss the hostages with bush administration 
officials said 
bush spoke to the impostor during a second phone call white 
house officials declined to go into details of the conversation 
suffice it to say it was a hoax phone call and thats all that 
matters fitzwater said 
he said the administration does not know who initiated the hoax 
and could not rule out the possibilty that it might have originated 
within a faction of the iranian government 
rafsanjani meanwhile ridiculed bush in a sermon broadcast on 
tehran radio can it be that such a global power with all its 
intelligence capabilities talks to a person it cannot identify 
he asked this is a strange occurrence 
the iranian leader said the episode showed how important iran 
was to the united states and added that it was gods grace that 
us officials had not been able to make contact with him 
fitzwaters statement said rafsanjanis statement reflects the 
difficulty of the situation one day we hear moderate points of 
view the next day we hear antagonistic ones 
our position remains steadfast we want to do everything we 
can to get the hostages out the president will talk to anyone any 
time fitzwater added 
was bush with his reputation for nonstop telephone diplomacy 
angered by the hoax no actually the president thinks its 
probably useful to have the american people know hes willing to 
follow up on these kinds of things fitzwater said 
while hoax phone calls are always a little embarrassing and 
difficult to deal with its important to the hostage families 
to know that president bushs policy is firm but he is personally 
committed to follow up every opportunity to get release of the 
hostages the spokesman said 
asked how a person whose identity could not be verified ended up 
talking to the president of the united states fitzwater said it 
the call got through because we wanted it to get through 
he said iran has a history of seeking to communicate with the 
west in an unorthodox manner and that any communication from 
the leadership of iran has to be treated differently 
fitzwater said the caller first talked to national security 
adviser brent scowcroft this call came in it was suspicious 
he said 
but the spokesman said bush was willing to make this call the 
second one on the offchance that it might be real 
fitzwater initially said that the caller left a number and that 
the white house returned the call using that number however he 
later was vague on whether the second call was placed or received 
by the white house saying he didnt want to get into such details 
the episode was first reported thursday by cbs news 
eight americans including terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press and 10 other westerners are 
being held hostage in lebanon most of them are being held factions 
loyal to iran 
the bush administration contends rafsanjanis government has 
influence with those holding the hostages 
in the past officials have said that the united states has had 
no direct contact with iran on the matter although there has been 
considerable activity through nongovernmental channels 
fitzwater asked whether the call would have constituted such a 
governmenttogovernment contact had it really been rafsanjani 
allowed that it would have been so in the future we wont talk 
about contacts he said 
the spokesman said just because one prankster got through to 
bush doesnt mean its open season for hoax calls 
let me make it clear before people start calling the white 
house he said all of these kinds of phone calls are checked 
out very carefully

hughes aircraft co admitted friday that 
it unlawfully obtained classified pentagon budget documents and 
agreed to pay the government 367 million officials said 
hughes which pleaded guilty to two felony counts is the fourth 
major defense contractor to admit to such charges three to six 
other pentagon contractors remain under investigation said michael 
j costello special agent in charge of the defense criminal 
investigative services washington field office 
the two counts against hughes concern fiveyear defense program 
documents issued in 1983 and 1984 summarizing resources planned 
programmed and budgeted by the department of defense according to 
a statement by susan j crawford the pentagons inspector general 
the documents were classified secret and they were not 
releasable to defense department contractors the statement said 
hughes through former employee frank j caso unlawfully 
acquired these and other classified pentagon documents from 
employees of other defense contractors between 1978 and 1985 
according to a statement from us attorney henry e hudson of the 
eastern district of virginia 
caso has not been charged said costello who added that he 
could not confirm nor deny whether caso was the subject of a 
criminal investigation 
the crawford statement said hughes tried to hide the fact that 
it had the documents before 1978 hughes did not enter the 
documents into its classified document accountability system from 
1978 through 1985 the documents were logged into the system but 
not under their actual titles in an attempt to hide their 
receipt the statement said 
richard dore a spokesman for the los angelesbased hughes did 
not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the case 
hughes agreed to pay 355 million in settlement of any civil 
liability which may arise out of its actions plus 50000 for 
investigative costs 50000 from its overhead account and a total 
of 20000 in penalties stemming from the actual charges each 
charge carries a maximum penalty of 10000 
the company will make the payment within five days according to 
the plea agreement entered before us district judge james c 
cacheris 
costello said he was not certain how much money if any hughes 
earned because of its access to the documents 
we would have to make an assumption that they did make 
money he said thats the reason for the 35 million 
settlement 
negotiations with hughes had been under way for several months 
he said 
the probe of defense contractors begun in the mid1980s and 
codenamed operation uncover has resulted in guilty pleas from 
three other major defense contractors as well gte government 
systems division the boeing company and rca corp costello said 
the investigation has been carried out by dcis the defense 
department inspector generals investigative arm 
gte paid about 300000 in fines in 1985 he said 
the boeing company paid fines and restitution of 52 million 
and a boeing employee richard lee fowler was convicted last 
december of 39 counts of conspiracy conveyance without authority 
conversion and mail fraud and sentenced to two years in prison the 
hudson statement said 
on feb 5 rca corp was ordered to pay fines and restitution of 
275 million and former rca employee leonard kampf and current 
rca employee ronald stevens each pleaded guilty to one felony count 
of conveyance without authority each faces up to 10 years in

the wampanoag indians who have lived on 
these red cliffs for centuries follow a simple creed that explains 
how they regained 400 acres and successfully battled jacqueline 
onassis in a decadeold land dispute 
they call it iootash meaning stand firm a word that 
was relayed to tribal members by the legendary chief annawon when 
the pilgrims arrived in 1620 
that philosophy has sustained them over the years spurring 
their fight for valuable acreage here that they say is of 
historical significance to the tribe they also ended the fight 
with mrs onassis last week when she agreed to give them a larger 
piece of land and 100000 in exchange for their shares of a tiny 
beachfront site on marthas vineyard that figures in tribal legend 
we tend to be stubborn said donald widdiss president of 
the wampanoag tribal council we tend to think very seriously 
about strategy and about what we want 
there may be only about 250 wampanoags on the island just south 
of cape cod but the tribe is tenacious the wampanoags were eking 
out a living on the clay cliffs around 1100 when leif erickson 
became the first white man to make contact with them 
some tribal members fought mrs onassis attempt to buy them out 
of the 15 acre site a tangled web of litigation that began in 
1980 mrs onassis owned a onesixth share of the land which is 
surrounded by her 400acre estate 
but 25 wampanoags the descendants of william vanderhoop an 
original owner of the site were determined to get another piece of 
land in exchange tribal legend has it that the site is where the 
great chief moshup threw his children into the sea when he foresaw 
the coming of the white man 
we didnt want to give up something that had belonged to our 
greatgreat grandfather said thelma vanderhoop weissberg 62 in 
an interview at her home after the settlement was announced 
wednesday in dukes county probate court 
i have a very special feeling about the land here its a 
feeling only an indian can have it was important we get more land 
in return not just money 
charlie vanderhoop 68 who was born at the gay head lighthouse 
when his father was the lighthouse keeper stood on the cliffs a 
few hours after the onassis settlement and pointed at a stretch of 
ocean known as the devils den in wampanoag lore 
everything here means something to me said vanderhoop i 
want to keep as much land as we can for our children 
the wampanoags have made their living from the sea for 
centuries not long ago it was whaling and swordfishing now those 
who can afford boats go shellfishing many of the women work in 
souvenir shops on the picturesque cliffs 
just how tough the wampanoags were was made clear in 1974 when 
they filed suit against the town of gay head for land they said was 
tribal property they claimed that the 1790 indian nonintercourse 
act forbidding transfer of indian lands without federal approval 
was violated in the 1870s when the state redistributed tribal lands 
to residents 
they won the land settlement several years ago just as they 
received federal recognition as a tribe the wampanoag were given 
45 million to buy back land in gay head 
beatrice gentry 79 another member of the vanderhoop family 
initiated the first lawsuits in the 1970s 
we wanted the land because its part of our culture said 
gentry who worked her way through college by making pots from the 
cliffs clay 
gay head on the southwestern tip of marthas vineyard is one 
of the poorest communities in the state although its just a few 
miles up the beach from the sprawling shingled summer homes of the 
wealthy and the wellknown during the past 100 years only two 
nonindians have been elected to the town council 
many wampanoag are wary of outsiders and some believe all the 
land in gay head should be returned to them they refuse to use the 
term pilgrims to describe the early white settlers 
they were invaders said widdiss

the state department said friday that syrian 
president hafez assad in denouncing democratic change in eastern 
europe and calling for an endless war against israel is out of 
step with the enormously promising changes unfolding around the 
world 
margaret tutwiler the departments spokeswoman said the people 
of the middle east including the people of syria have no need 
for more bellicose rhetoric 
rather they need real statesmanship and commitment to the 
practical steps needed to bring about a palestinianarab dialogue 
leading to a comprehensive peace settlement she said 
assad addressing a youth rally in damascus on thursday called 
for an infinite holy war against israel and said the changes 
sweeping eastern europe are a boon to the jewish state 
assad denounced the recent wave of soviet jewish emigration to 
israel saying migrating jews would force palestinians from their 
homeland 
let us now perceive that israel was the first beneficiary 
among all nations of the world of the international changes that 
have taken place assad said 
he said the jihad or holy war against israel should be as 
long as time 
ms tutwiler said president assads criticism is out of step 
with the enormously promising changes unfolding around the world as 
well as with the serious effort to move toward peace in the middle 
east 
president assad ought to be commiting himself to peace not 
war she said

proposals to cut social security and capital 
gains taxes are in a tight race for an award for dumbest ideas of 
the year congress chief taxwriter said friday 
i was left nearly speechless by this competition until i 
finally decided to simply call both proposals political junk food 
and just let them go at that rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee said in a speech in 
boca raton fla 
rostenkowski took jabs at president bush who wants to cut taxes 
on capital gains and some senior democrats led by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan of new york who want to cut social security taxes 
democratic leaders are weighing how to respond to moynihans 
proposal which has particular appeal in an election year their 
response on that issue will be included in a plan expected in the 
near future setting out the partys policy on an array of tax 
issues 
rostenkowski has written a piece to be published in sundays 
washington post in which he spells out his own suggestions on taxes 
and deficit reduction he is expected to rely on one of his 
favorite ideas a sharp increase in the gasoline tax and on 
raising taxes on tobacco alcohol and oil 
bushs proposed cut in taxes on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of investments is worse than the one the president 
recommended last year rostenkowski said in the speech 
at a time when the deficit is too big he suggests cutting 
taxes rostenkowski said at a time when people are concerned 
about erosion of the tax systems progressivity he wants to make 
it less progressive meaning it would be based less on the 
ability to pay 
a copy of rostenkowskis florida speech was made available in 
washington 
the congressman ridiculed moynihans conclusion that social 
security taxes should be cut because surplus taxes are being used 
to hide the true size of the overall budget deficit the 1983 
reform plan moynihan helped write was not broken rostenkowski 
said but he decided to fix it by suggesting that social security 
taxes be cut 
if there were an academy award for the worst idea of the year 
wed be watching a very tight race here rostenkowski said 
since he was speaking to a meeting of the futures industry 
association whose members trade in commodities rostenkowski added 
a third candidate for the dubious award bushs proposal to tax 
transactions in the futures markets 
he promised to oppose that proposal vigorously but predicted it 
might fare better in the senate finance committee 
in washington meanwhile rostenkowskis senior aides told 
reporters we dont think we have the votes now to beat a capital 
gains cut 
the aides who spoke on condition of anonymity also released 
the latest in a series of reports concluding that cutting capital 
gains taxes would continue to shift more of the tax burden away 
from upperincome americans 
the report is based on congressional budget office analysis of 
trends in taxation since 1977 the basic conclusion is that major 
tax laws enacted in 1978 and 1981 cut taxes significantly for the 
wealthiest americans but not nearly so much for those who earn less 
rostenkowski in a statement on the new report said the 
reduction in tax burdens for the wealthy was staggering 
the cbo conclusion is essentially the same as that in a study by 
citizens for tax justice that was made public thursday that study 
found if tax laws were made as fair today as they were in 1977 all 
but the richest 10 percent would pay less and the government would 
still collect 675 billion a year more 
the bush administration prefers to point out to figures showing 
the richest americans pay a greater share of the total tax burden 
than they were in 1977 congressional economists agree but say 
thats because incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent have soared 
during the same period

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
friday that the telephone hoax in which president bush thought he 
was talking to rafsanjani was a disaster for washington 
speaking in a sermon in tehran rafsanjani marveled at the fact 
that bush could be duped by an impostor 
can it be that such a global power with all its intelligence 
capabilities talks to a person it cannot identify he asked 
this is a strange occurrence 
this shows the united states very much needs to talk to iran 
but with gods grace it is deprived of this blessing he said 
standing behind a podium with his hands resting on the barrel of 
an ak47 rifle rafsanjani said 
irans stature in the world is so high that the strongest 
power in the world and the greatest power on earth is grappling to 
find an opening to your executive leader even through telephone 
wires 
he said iran expected the united states to answer such questions 
as who was the intermediary who did they talk to and what did 
they talk about 
now we must wait for explanations and witness another irangate 
in the making god willing rafsanjani said referring to the 
reagan administrations illfated attempt to sell weapons to iran 
in return for the release of the us hostages in lebanon and then 
giving the money to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington on 
thursday that bush returned a phone call last month to a man he 
thought was the iranian president but it turned out to be a hoax 
fitzwater did not give details of the conversation or say how it 
was discovered the call was a hoax cbs news said the two men spoke 
about the release of the us hostages 
rafsanjani said the incident provided a glimpse of the 
confusion of leaders inside the white house 
there is a new disaster in washington which i think is a 
wonder he said in the hourlong sermon which was broadcast on 
tehran television and monitored in nicosia 
the bush administration has said it believes that rafsanjanis 
government has influence with the captors of the eight americans 
and 10 other western captives held in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
the disclosure of the hoax came amid a flurry of recent reports 
indicating movement on the hostage issue however us officials 
have said they are unable to cite any progress toward freeing the 
hostages 
fitzwater said that although bush was tricked once he would do 
the same thing again if he thought it would help win the release of 
the hostages 
if a call came through at some future point that we believed 
was real he would take it fitzwater said the president has 
made it known hes willing to talk to iran at any time and the 
ball is in their court 
in a related develoment a previously unknown group threatened 
to kill one of two swiss hostages in lebanon unless two lebanese 
jailed in france and switzerland are freed 
the threat by the action group for the release of mohammed 
hariri was made by an anonymous phone caller to a western news 
agency in nicosia 
mohammed hariri was jailed for life in switzerland in february 
1989 for hijacking an air afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a 
french passenger after the aircraft landed in geneva

members of congress scolded the bush 
administration friday for failing to meet the deadline for setting 
out regulations to assure the quality and accuracy of all medical 
laboratory tests 
lawmakers were not appeased by the health care financing 
administrations announcement that final rules to bring 12000 
medical labs under uniform national testing standards would be 
published next week and could go into effect after a 60day comment 
period 
by hcfas own estimate there are between 300000 and 600000 
medical testing facilities including labs in physicians offices 
employer health units public health departments blood banks and 
public screening labs most of those would be covered by other 
rules hcfa is drafting but has not yet formally proposed 
it is critical that all laboratories be regulated said sen 
brock adams dwash each month the implementation is 
delayed more cases of cancer go undetected more men and women 
receive erroneous laboratory reports and more tragedies result 
we need a sense of urgency added sen barbara mikulski 
dmd at the joint hearing of the senate labor and human resources 
committee and the governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of 
government management 
gail wilensky who recently took over as head of hcfa told the 
lawmakers the rules covering 12000 labs that receive payments from 
medicare and medicaid will make a tremendous difference in the 
way those labs operate 
she said those rules were already being drafted when congress 
passed a law in 1988 giving hcfa authority to regulate all testing 
labs and directing the agency to have rules in place to implement 
the law by jan 1 1990 
the main reason for the delay in meeting that deadline she 
said was major unexpected dissension within the scientific 
community over which tests should be subject to the least 
regulation because of their simplicity and low risk to the patient 
and which ones should meet tougher standards 
she said hcfa expected to propose rules to meet the 1988 law in 
three stages the first set of rules which she expected to be 
proposed by midapril would define three levels of testing and the 
personnel quality assurance and proficiency testing requirements 
for each level 
pressed by lawmakers to estimate when the law would be fully 
implemented wilensky said it would depend on how many comments the 
agency receives on the proposals but that she hoped it would be 
within two years 
lawmakers have been particularly concerned about pap tests used 
to detect cervical cancer reports about inaccuracies in these 
tests helped spur passage of the 1988 law rep carl levin 
dmich estimated that up to 40 percent of pap test results are 
done incorrectly 
wilensky said 75 percent of pap tests are performed by the 
12000 labs that will soon be regulated but leven said that will 
still leave as many as 20 million pap tests each year being read by 
unregulated labs 
thats still a huge number waiting for some kind of 
assurance levin said 
under the regulations hcfa expects to propose next month some 
tests would be waived from regulation because they are simple low 
risk and have little margin for error rep ron wyden dore who 
testified at the hearing said he was concerned that tests for 
strep throat sickle cell anemia blood clotting and gonorrhea 
would be exempt 
cholesterol screening would be subject to a higher level of 
oversight and regulation because the test is more complex and 
involves a greater degree of risk to the patient if performed 
incorrectly wilensky said 
the highest level of regulation would be imposed for tests such 
as the pap smear and for aids infection she said

the man who had directed public relations for 
the census bureau since 1983 has been moved out of that job just 
three weeks before the national head count gets into gear 
the transfer of james gorman came after a news story about 
confusion over how the commerce department would observe the moment 
the nations population reached 250 million according to census 
employees who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity 
gorman was quoted by the new york times as saying we couldnt 
get it together when asked about confusion over staging the 
event last week 
gorman declined to comment on his transfer to a new post as a 
senior adviser to the deputy director of the bureau 
officials of the commerce department parent agency for the 
census bureau were not immediately available 
the bureau calculates the nation inceases by one person every 14 
seconds and thus estimated that the quarterbillion population 
figure was reached march 6 a news release was issued and a photo 
opportunity scheduled involving commerce department officials 
but that was later rescheduled from march 6 to march 8 and the 
site moved from the bureau office in suitland md to the commerce 
department in downtown washington 
eventually the event was dropped altogether 
gormans comment to the newspaper apparently provoked his 
transfer census employees said from the public relations post in 
which he had supervised planning for the current national head 
count over the last several years 
gormans post is being filled by an assistant on an acting basis

last weekend the district of columbias nonvoting delegate in 
congress walter fauntroy said he would run in november for the 
mayors post now held by barry who faces an eightcount federal 
indictment on drug and perjury charges

hes been hurt by the defections of his top advisers said one 
source familiar with barrys thinking he plans to talk to these 
people and also meet with his people on the ward level to see if 
he can run again 
the sources commented on condition of anonymity 
anita bonds barrys campaign manager acknowledged that barry 
was disappointed by fauntroys decision and upset with former

fouryear term but he delayed making any public announcement of 
his plans aides have since predicted the mayor would be reluctant 
to stay out of the race 
hes got to have some time to get the lay of the land bonds 
said i dont believe he will have crystallized his plans in a 
day or two or anything like that

prime minister margaret thatcher on friday blamed 
leftist militants for violent protests of a new tax that has 
sparked a popular revolt and the opposition leader said the 
demonstrators were playing into the governments hands 
authorities in the east london borough of hackney were cleaning 
up after thursday nights rampage by opponents of the tax called 
the community charge by the conservative government but popularly 
known as the poll tax 
the revolt is presenting mrs thatcher with a serious political 
setback and rumors circulated friday that she would resign or be 
fired as conservative leader 
we are not at the peak of our popularity said sir geoffrey 
howe deputy prime minister in a radio interview but he added 
we have to keep our nerve 
the crisis also is dividing the opposition labor party some 
laborites are urging a campaign of civil disobedience against the 
tax but leader neil kinnock said all opposition must be within the 
law 
mrs thatcher blamed a leftist group known as militant tendency 
for the violence that left hackneys main street strewn with glass 
and police have said the disturbances were caused by people from 
outside the boroughs 
as you know it is not the way to conduct affairs at all 
the prime minister said in glasgow scotland any conduct 
intimidating or violent is absolutely contradictory to democracy 
police arrested about 60 people nine of whom appeared in court 
friday on charges including assault and criminal damage they said 
20 of those arrested gave addresses outside the borough 
about 30 police officers were injured and the extent of the 
damage was being assessed police said 
the community charge replaces the system of taxing homeowners to 
pay for government services instead municipal councils will now 
divide the costs of services equally among all adults in their 
districts 
charges vary widely depending on the level of services provided 
by a district and since each adult is taxed it means two people 
living in a tworoom apartment would pay twice as much as one 
person living next door in an eightroom house 
local legislators in the borough of haringey met friday to 
discuss their districts tax which at 974 is one of the highest 
in the country during a meeting of the council monday night 
demonstrations outside turned violent and police had to clear 
shouting protesters from the spectator section 
on friday about 50 people peacefully protested outside 
both mrs thatcher and kinnock were in scotland which has had 
its own poll tax for the past year and an estimated half a million 
people are being prosecuted for failure to pay 
kinnock told the scottish labor partys conference that a labor 
government would abolish the poll tax which he dubbed maggies 
tax and replace it with a tax based on property and the ability 
to pay but he urged that opposition to it stay within the law 
we who seek through democracy the power to rule by law 
cannot pick and choose which laws we obey kinnock said he said 
the demonstrators were helping the conservatives cause by using 
violence to protest 
but fellow laborite tony benn said he would not pay the tax 
which he called unjust 
mrs thatcher tried to dismiss rumors of worries within her 
government that the poll tax would make the conservatives lose the 
next election 
i find no nervousness in the cabinet at all she told the 
bbc 
the new tax takes effect april 1 in england and wales when 
local districts must submit to the federal government their annual 
charges 
disabled people and those with low incomes can receive rebates 
of up to 80 percent but critics say that apart from this the new 
tax is unfair because it takes no account of an individuals 
ability to pay 
in latest opinion polls the conservatives trail labor by as 
much as 19 points

tree limbs were stacked head high along 
curbs in many des moines neighborhoods friday as the metropolitan 
area cleaned up from what the state climatologist said may have 
been the ice storm of the century 
two days after central iowa was glazed with thick ice 
temperatures were in the 60s and rivers were rising 
the storm stuck at least an inch of ice on tree limbs and power 
lines wednesday cutting electrical service to 91000 customers 
more than half of the metropolitan area iowa power spokesman chuck 
seel said the company hoped the remaining customers would be hooked 
up by sunday 
the utility had restored power to all but about 14000 customers 
by friday morning 
were tickled to death at how well its gone seel said 
a lot of those who are without service have the toughest 
repairs he said such as service lines ripped out of houses by 
falling limbs 
hundreds of linemen and their boom trucks were brought in from 
other cities and nearly all were working double shifts 
there are at least 330 linemen or tree men out there and 150 
worked through the night seel said 
state climatologist harry hillaker said other ice storms have 
caused damage but none were as severe 
ive checked other storms that were called the worst of this 
century and this one was more widespread he said 
rivers were swollen with runoff friday as the ice melted but no 
flooding was reported 
the storm also iced sections of states north and west of iowa 
two days earlier it dumped as much as 50 inches of snow on colorado 
and wyoming major highways in southeastern wyoming werent 
reopened until late thursday 
des moines and its suburbs urged homeowners to haul tree limbs 
broken by the weight of the ice out to the curb where they would 
be hauled away within several weeks huge stacks of twisted 
branches began to appear thursday sometimes spilling on to street 
or sidewalks 
one woman said the experience was enough to make californians 
thankful that all they have to worry about are earthquakes 
people are always telling me that they wouldnt live in 
california because they dont want to be in an earthquake what i 
went through here trees crashing and everything was as bad as 
going through an earthquake said mary marie scatterlee of san 
jose calif who was visiting des moines when the storm hit 
although falling trees hit practically everything and traffic 
lights did not work no serious injuries or deaths were attributed 
to the storm 
melted ice cream drooled out of freezers and meat spoiled as 
many residents and businesses saw their third day without 
electricity 
businesses without power simply shut down as did des moines 
schools and drake university for a second day friday but some 
improvised to serve their customers 
taits super valu a grocery store opened for five hours 
thursday after an employee donated a generator to run lights and 
coolers 
but there wasnt enough power to run the checkout computers and 
price scanners customers were asked to remember what things cost 
and checkers punched adding machines 
its hard to tell how much we lost but people who shop at 
grocery stores are generally honest said grocery manager tim 
harrington 
it worked pretty well and people werent buying large 
quantities of things since they didnt have refrigeration at home 
either he said 
des moines cold storage co inc housing 20 million pounds of 
perishable goods was able to save most of its stock 
its perishables of all descriptions said president chuck 
muelhaupt thats meat ice cream vegetables we were scared to 
death if it hadnt come on you would have seen the biggest mass 
of melted ice cream you would have had the worlds largest garbage

the official libyan news agency appealed to arab 
news agencies on friday to combat a us campaign of lies 
regarding a plant outside tripoli that washington says produces 
chemical weapons 
the rabta plant in great jamahiriya libya is a plant for the 
production of medicines and medical equipment the general 
secretary of the news agency jana was quoted as saying 
his comments were in a telex sent to directors of the federation 
of arab news agencies and the agencies of the arab maghreb union 
and the arab news federation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater alleged this week that 
the plant 60 miles south of tripoli was producing poison gas other 
us officials said the plant was making limited amounts of mustard 
gas and nerve agents 
west german foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher said 
friday there are vague indications about a possible production of 
a limited amount of about 30 tons of mustard gas at the plant 
the information came from west german intelligence early this 
year and us officials were immediately informed about the 
report the spokesman said 
relations between bonn and washington were strained early last 
year after us officials accused west german companies of helping 
libya build the plant 
the west german government first denied the allegations but 
later launched its own probe which is still pending 
the us administration leads a campaign of lies and false 
accusations from which it aims to mislead the world public opinion 
claiming that this cultural medical plant is a plant for chemical 
weapons said the jana director who was not identified 
jana said its director called on the arab agencies to join in 
arab solidarity in the face of the biased informational media 
campaign and to foil the whole us aggressive scheme 
us officials have said they want the rabta plant dismantled 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has called for 
international inspections to be carried out at rabta 
libya has repeatedly denied the rabta plant is designed to 
produce chemical weapons or that it has begun manufacturing poison 
gas

the senate armed services committee has voted 
to grant the pentagon part of the authority to transfer money to 
military personnel accounts and avert massive layoffs the panels 
chairman said friday 
but the action should have little overall effect on the 
departments request since rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee has refused to take up the issue in 
his panel 
such shifting of funds must be approved by the house and senate 
armed services panels and the house and senate appropriations 
committees 
the defense department originally asked congress for the 
authority to transfer 935 million from weapons and other accounts 
to personnel to avoid laying off tens of thousands of men and 
women freezing promotions and holding up transfers 
the drastic steps are required under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
but aspin said president bush could have exempted personnel from 
the law back on aug 15 as past administrations have done and 
declined to take up the pentagons request 
putting weapons before people was their decision and now 
theyre stuck with it aspin said late last month 
nevertheless the senate committee voted in executive session 
thursday to approve 85 percent of the pentagons request or 795 
million from weapons to personnel accounts 
the action would force the defense department to take some 
voluntary steps including reducing the number of new recruits 
during the rest of fiscal 1990 and allowing some people to leave 90 
days before their service ends 
the department would be spared involuntary adverse personnel 
actions 
we voted on the side of the men and women in the military who 
were put at risk by the administrations decision not to use its 
authority to exempt the military personnel accounts sen sam 
nunn dga the armed services chairman said in a speech on the 
senate floor friday 
in a related development aspin said friday significant cuts in 
defense spending are possible over the next several years but 
initial cuts will have to be small 
a concerted and strategic effort is needed to restructure our 
armed forces consistent with the imperative to buy the right 
combination of forces equipment operational readiness and 
research in this time of great change and uncertainity he said 
in a letter to the rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the 
house budget committee aspin declined to reveal his overall figure 
for the fiscal 1991 defense budget 
the bush administration has proposed a budget of 3067 billion 
including funds for defense the department of energy and military 
construction 
in a republican response to aspins letter rep william 
dickinson rala expressed his support for the administrations 
budget and warned against deep cuts in defense spending 
although most of us feel more secure when assessing soviet 
military intentions soviet military capability even after the 
pending cfe and start agreements are concluded remains 
formidable said dickinson the panels ranking gop member 
nunn in a letter to the senate budget committee said he 
couldnt provide an overall figure for the fiscal 1991 defense 
budget because the pentagon hasnt produced a comprehensive 
fiveyear defense plan 
in addition nunn noted the pentagon is currently reviewing 
several bigticket programs such as the b2 stealth bomber the 
c17 transport plane and the strategic defense initiative 
in order for the armed services committee and the whole 
congress to make decisions on the fiscal 1991 defense budget we 
must have a clear picture of where our defense policies are going 
over the next three to five years nunn said in a threepage 
letter

an official from the us embassy in moscow 
testified friday that a terrorist warning prior to the december 
1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 was widely distributed to 
americans in moscow and given to soviet officials 
the state department previously acknowledged only that the 
notice was improperly posted in the embassy a week before flight 
103 blew up over lockerbie scotland killing 270 people 
officials said the posting violated a policy against notifying 
government workers when other prospective passengers are not told 
of a threat 
raymond f smith who was acting deputy chief of mission in 
moscow at the time told the presidential commission on aviation 
security and terrorism that he felt a moral obligation to let 
people know about the threat against pan am flights between 
frankfurt and the united states 
smith said in sworn testimony that he knew of no other embassy 
that disseminated the notice publicly state department officials 
have said the threat turned out to be a hoax orginating in 
helsinki finland despite the fact it fit the lockerbie bombing 
smith said embassy officials decided in a toplevel staff 
meeting to give the notice the widest distribution possible 
posting it at several strategic places around the compound and 
sending it to a company that contracted workz 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to the soviet government 
the official who is now moscow embassy political counsellor 
said he also notified the federal aviation administration which 
had originated the advisory that the notice was being posted and 
received no response 
the embassy notice said employees were left to their own 
discretion on whether to change travel plans but noted they still 
were required to fly on an american carrier pan am was the only 
us carrier flying out of moscow although other airlines could be 
used from europe to the united states 
also at the hearing the commission disclosed a telex from pan 
ams moscow office saying that 80 percent of moscow passengers were 
changing their bookings as a result of the posted threat 
but the official who sent the internal telex the airlines 
former moscow manager jennifer s young testified that she had no 
direct knowledge of any cancelations and used the 80percent figure 
to give her missive more impact 
ms young said a parttime reservations clerk at pan ams office 
in the embassy had told her there were several inquiries about the 
notice and she got the impression there also were cancelations 
commission chairwoman ann mclaughlin said the panel staff has 
yet to find hard evidence of any changes in bookings as a result of 
the threat but has asked pan am for passenger data and is 
continuing its investigation 
relatives of some of the us victims of the dec 21 1988 
bombing have questioned why the plane had more than 160 empty seats 
on a flight during a busy holiday period and say they believe 
government workers canceled because of the selective warning 
family members of victims filled the first three rows at the 
hearing which is the commissions fourth since it began its work 
last september 
mrs mclaughlin former labor secretary said the commission has 
conducted 150 interviews in the united states england germany 
france the soviet union and turkey and has accumulated thousands 
of pages of testimony 
the panel which has a 1 million budget has until may 15 to 
complete a report to president bush that will recommend government 
actions to combat aviation terrorism in addition to former labor 
secretary mclaughlin members include sens alfonse damato

many israelis are lured to 
the west bank by cheap land low or interestfree mortgages and the 
desire for the space they lack in most of the countrys crowded 
cities 
such benefits have played a significant role in attracting 
75000 jews to 143 settlements in the past two decades they are 
also a selling point in efforts by settlement leaders to attract 
soviet jews who are flooding into israel 
a new controversy erupted over the settlements following prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs suggestion which he quickly withdrew 
that israel might need the land captured in the 1967 middle east 
war for settling tens of thousands of new soviet immigrants 
his remark set off arab fears of israel annexing the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip and prompted us warnings that israel 
would not receive 400 million in requested housing guarantees if 
it settled soviet jews on occupied land 
shamir stressed there was no policy of settling soviet jews in 
occupied areas and there are no special incentives beyond 
those given to development towns in remote areas of israel where 
tax breaks are provided to encourage growth and industry 
israel harel editor of the settler magazine nekuda said a 
drive to bring soviet immigrants to the territories has been 
without much success 
he said that only about 200 have been placed in the west bank 
and even they had not made a final decision to live there 
the reasons varied most of the settlements are religious and 
the immigrants are secular they like to go to cities not small 
villages like ours the intefadeh uprising doesnt help the 
cause either he said 
meron benvenisti an exdeputy mayor of jerusalem who has 
studied the territories for a decade said even without new 
enticements existing benefits for any west bank settler were 
considerable 
he estimated the government and the world zionist organization 
have spent 25 billion in the past 20 years building and 
maintaining the settlements 
the government has paid for roads lighting and other site 
preparations it also allocates more money per pupil to educate 
settlement children and covers the cost of their busing benvenisti 
said 
settlers enjoy a 7 percent reduction in income taxes and 
industries opening in the territories receive a 40 percent grant 
for the purchase of equipment he said 
also benvenisti said the israel lands authority sells settlers 
building plots from land expropriated from arabs for 5 percent of 
the assessed value about 40 percent of the west bank was taken 
over by the state under a 1980 decree that expropriated all 
unregistered and uncultivated land 
settlement leaders are eager to recruit and have mounted a 
campaign to attract both soviet immigrants and nativeborn israelis 
color glossy brochures promise daycare centers clear 
mountain air and activities for all ages 
a flyer from beit abba near tel aviv pictures a spacious 
swimming pool one from beit aryeh advertises a community for 
people with initiative and creativity in the center of the 
country although it is not in israel but in the west bank 
and in the west bank settlement of ariel where 8000 people 
live about 25 miles north of jerusalem a program has been set up 
to help soviet immigrants 
it provides temporary housing free of charge and arranges for a 
family to adopt newcomers to help get them through government red 
tape language classes and assistance in finding jobs and permanent 
housing are also available 
we make them feel very wanted said dina shalit a mayoral 
assistant for immigration affairs 
she said soviet immigrants interested in settling in ariel 
usually have family or friends among the 150 russian families who 
were among the original founders in the 1970s in the past six 
months about 55 soviet jewish families have come to ariel 
but not all the efforts are successful one reason being that 
the palestinian uprising means most settlers carry arms and have to 
be alert constantly for attackers with stones and firebombs 
leaders of the gush katif block of settlements in the gaza strip 
recently organized a tour for soviet newcomers but spokesman 
menachem beit halachmi conceded there have been no takers so far 
but the settlements have succeeded in attracting israelis 
mostly ardent nationalists who believe living on the warwon land 
will help in making it a permanent part of israel 
the settlements have grown by 15 percent in the past two years 
despite the uprising in which more than 600 palestinians and 43 
israelis have died 
most of the people who come to us are coming for ideological 
reasons despite the intefadeh harel said 
but a main attraction for many especially in the jerusalem and 
tel aviv areas is a better standard of living than can be found in 
cramped city apartments 
in the hilltop settlement of har adar six miles northwest of 
jerusalem 240 families have built luxurious carved stone villas 
for the price of a threebedroom apartment in jerusalem 
we moved out here because we wanted to live in a house and we 
couldnt afford it in the city and here we are only 20 minutes 
from downtown said debbie zuberi 33 who emigrated from san 
francisco 12 years ago and lives in a threestory home with a view 
of jerusalem 
shalit of ariel explained the trend its like the onetime 
american push to the suburbs people are looking for cleaner air 
less traffic bigger homes and better schools she said

police said friday that 19 
blacks were killed in factional fighting near johannesburg and 
rightwing whites blamed government concessions to blacks for the 
upsurge in violence nationwide 
this country is burning literally and figuratively and you 
are responsible for it moolman mentz of the proapartheid 
conservative party told president fw de klerk at a parliamentary 
debate in cape town 
de klerk legalized more than 60 opposition groups feb 2 to help 
clear the way for negotiations on ending whiteminority rule and 
sharing political power with the black majority 
in the past month violence in black townships and tribal 
homelands has left 200 people dead in some of the worst fighting 
since the nationwide black unrest of 198486 
mentz whose party is the official opposition in the white 
chamber of parliament said the reforms had emboldened black 
nationalist groups to try to seize power 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament the 
government was determined to end unrest and was prepared to use its 
extensive powers under the 3yearold state of emergency to quell 
the violence 
the worst fighting was in kathlehong about 12 miles east of 
johannesburg where five people were killed overnight and 14 more 
bodies were found during the day friday police said 
the fighting began several days ago between rival black taxi 
groups over control of routes and other local problems not directly 
related to politics 
the dispute has escalated and groups of black youths have been 
waging running battles against each other according to police and 
witnesses 
houses have been attacked with fire bombs vehicles have been 
stoned and set on fire and there has been sporadic gunfire most of 
the dead were stabbed or hacked to death police said 
also police said they detained 53 blacks without charges in the 
central orange free state province police said the blacks were 
picked up during an overnight sweep through the townships but 
declined to elaborate 
police said they arrested 67 whites armed with whips and other 
weapons who tried to disrupt a legal march by black teachers in the 
central town of welkom 
the south african government charged thursday that some 
antiapartheid groups arebehind the outbreak of violence in tribal 
homelands because they are not ready to participate in negotiations 
with the white government 
but anc leader walter sisulu said friday the government was 
reverting to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and 
hidden instigators 
the primary reason for the unrest conflict and confrontation 
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid 
sisulu said 
benny alexander leader of the pan africanist congress a rival 
black guerrilla group said his organization would neither confirm 
nor deny that it was behind the recent violence 
meanwhile residents in the nominally independent black homeland 
of bophuthatswana said friday that scattered clashes with security 
forces were continuing 
seven people were killed and up to 500 hurt in bophuthatswana 
earlier this week after police fired on protesters demanding the

president najib had just finished 
lunch when a series of bombs exploded several yards from where he 
was sitting signaling the start of a coup attempt that almost 
toppled his government 
explosions rocked the presidential palace shortly after 1 pm 
tuesday killing four soldiers from the elite presidential guard 
one cluster of three small bombs gouged out two craters and gutted 
an adminstrative office 12 feet from where najib was working 
the force of the blast cracked the walls of najibs office said 
lt col mohammad hussan who was on duty at the time windows 
shattered around the president but he apparently emerged unscathed 
interviews friday with government officials and witnesses both 
soldiers and civilians painted a vivid picture of the bloody 
attempt to topple najibs sovietinstalled government 
the attempt was the eighth since najib became president in 1988 
despite its failure the coup is expected to damage najib who also 
faces continued pressure from usbacked anticommunist guerrillas 
tension had been mounting before the bombing began on tuesday 
morning najib talked to defense minister shah nawaz tanai and 
urged him not to attempt the coup najib told a news conference 
thursday 
the main disagreement according to government officials was 
that tanai opposed the arrests of 127 people who were being placed 
on trial for an alleged coup attempt in december 
government spokesman naqib sameer said tanai opposed the trial 
because it would reveal his links to the plot but tanai supporters 
said the defense minister was worried about driving another wedge 
between the already factionridden ruling party the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
on monday the trial started the next day najib called his 
defense minister and suggested negotiations tanai refused 
the rebel bombing began shortly after 1230 pm as the city 
settled down to lunch the first bombs hit the city center near 
two empty high schools closed due to lack of funds for education 
and fuel to heat the school 
as many as five jets at a time sped over the capital 
one dropped a 500pound bomb in the old city near the serpentine 
streets of the grain bazaar 
i was sitting here fixing watches when the houses across the 
street just collapsed said haji mallem a watchmender who works 
on the main old city thoroughfare everybody started screaming 
and running glass flew everywhere i saw about 15 people blown 
apart 
whoever did it wasnt a good moslem one man shouted from a 
crowd that had gathered around mallen to help tell the story 
more bombs fell throughout the afternoon from his headquarters 
at the defense ministry tanai sneaked to bagram air base north of 
the city another cener for renegade forces 
the early hours of the coup appeared to favor the mutineers 
bombs at kabul radio forced officials to switch broadcasting 
locations parliamentarian and alleged coup participant saleh 
mohammad zeray went to radio kabul to announce that tanais forces 
had won 
he was arrested with the statement in his pocket a government 
source said bakhtar reported friday that he had been purged of his 
party posts 
the government was fighting back 
withering fire from loyalist tanks and rockets destroyed the 
coup headquarters at the defense ministry located in the 
pastelcolored darulaman palace built after 1919 to house an 
afghan king 
loyalist tanks and footsoldiers with handheld rockets 
surrounded the building during a 24 hour assault on friday the 
building was a shell of its former self with huge holes gaping 
from its facade 
an onslaught of gunfire destroyed another palace the tajbig 
near the darulaman a fire gutted most of the marble building food 
lay rotting in an open oven 
government troops also attacked bagram air base another rebel 
stronghold by tuesday night government forces were firing scud 
and katyusha rockets at the base destroying it by wednesday 
afternoon most of the fighting had stopped 
arrests began five members of the politburo including tanai 
were purged from their posts some escaped and some have 
disappeared two central committee members including zeray also 
were removed 
squads of security forces entered government housing projects 
and arrested scores of alleged participants government sources 
said 
one trial began thursday a special tribunal set up by najib 
will handle the case 
the bakhtar news agency promised punishment in accordance with 
afghan tradition death sentences were expected

the mongolian communist party central committee 
bowed to mass demonstrations friday and agreed to consider ousting 
the entire ruling politburo tass reported 
the announcement by mongolian president and communist party 
leader zhambyn batmunh on the landlocked nations television 
marked the first time that the revolution sweeping through the 
communist bloc has threatened a regime in asia 
fridays events brought the wave of political reform to the 
doorstep of china which has crushed its own democracy movement 
last spring with the army attack on protesters in beijing 
protesters crowded the vast central square of ulan bator the 
mongolian capital on friday to demand a new constitution and 
creation of a provisional congress with the participation of all 
public forces the soviet news agency said it gave no estimate of 
the size of the crowd but said the site is normally deserted on a 
workday 
demonstrators in the square also demanded an emergency party 
congress and change in the partys leadership 
many speakers called for a general strike starting saturday 
tass said 
batmunh responded friday evening on national television with the 
promise that the communist partys central committee will meet 
monday to consider the resignation of the top leaders in the 
politburo and the convening of a special party congress tass said 
batmunh also promised a referendum so the people could cast a 
vote of confidence or lack of it in the great peoples hural or 
congress 
tass said members of the mongolian democratic union and other 
public movements ended their threeday hunger strike after the 
announcement friday because their demands had been met 
tass apparently was referring to the groups immediate goals 
because the democratic union also is calling for an end to the 
communist partys 69year monopoly on power a multiparty system 
and resignation of the premier cabinet and congress 
premier dumaagiyn sodnom said thursday the government would 
cooperate with the democratic union on reforms 
foreign sources estimated 8000 to 10000 mongolians 
demonstrated sunday in the central square in front of the congress 
building speakers at that rally demanded the communist party give 
up its 69year monopoly on power 
protesters also have been complaining about longterm soviet 
domination of their nation of 2 million people accusing their 
enormous neighbor of pushing mongolia into a debtors prison by 
forcing it to build enormous unprofitable construction projects 
with soviet help and paying poorly for mongolias valuable natural 
resources said the soviet newspaper komsomolskaya pravda on 
wednesday 
western economists estimate mongolias debt to the soviet union 
at nearly 6 billion 
komsomolskaya pravda was defensive about the history of soviet 
relations with mongolia but said the protesters were just in 
criticizing the bureaucratic system and demanding faster 
perestroika the soviet newspaper used the same word for 
reconstruction that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev uses 
for his reform program 
mongolian protesters also have demanded the removal of 60000 
soviet troops and 50000 soviet advisers and their families soviet 
officials agreed last week to withdraw all their troops from 
mongolia by 1992 as part of gorbachevs announced pullback of 
soviet forces around the world

the environmental protection agencys program 
to reduce air pollution over national parks and wilderness areas is 
so riddled with shortcomings that most polluters escape federal 
regulation a congressional study said friday 
only about 1 percent of all the pollution sources studied 
accounting for about 10 percent of the pollution are regulated 
the general accounting office said in a report on pollution of five 
parks and wilderness areas 
a dozen years after enactment of laws to preserve clean air over 
national parks and wilderness areas the federal program set up to 
do the job have either failed or have never been tried said rep 
mike synar dokla 
synar is chairman of the government operations subcommittee on 
environment energy and natural resources which asked for the 
study by the general accounting office and conducted a hearing on 
it friday the gao is the investigatory arm of congress 
william rosenberg the epas assistant administrator for air and 
radiation acknowledged that some national parks are experiencing 
poor air quality because of pollution from nearby urban areas or in 
some cases pollution that may originate hundreds of miles away 
the epa pollution control program for parks and wilderness areas 
was never designed or envisioned to affect sources which existed 
prior to 1977 unless or until they undergo major modification 
and was structured to focus primarily on major sources 
rosenberg told the subcommittee 
the five areas studied were affected by 2330 stationary sources 
of pollution the gao said but only 27 were regulated 
the rest were exempt either because they were too small to come 
under the statute or had existed before enactment of the 1977 law 
although they together accounted for some 90 percent of the 
pollution over the parks and wilderness grounds 
among the pollutants found in the air at the five sites were 
sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide smoke dust and 
soot and ozone 
the investigators said that although only five locations were 
examined similar pollution likely exists in most of the other 153 
national parks or wilderness areas singled out for special air 
quality control treatment under 1977 amendments to the clean air 
act 
the five locations examined by the gao were the rocky mountain 
national park and flat tops wilderness area both in colorado the 
shenandoah national park and james river face wilderness area in 
virginia and the cape romain wilderness area in south carolina 
at shenandoah where ozone levels in 1988 exceeded national 
health standards 83 percent and 95 percent of two chemicals that 
create smog came from sources that were exempt from the 
regulations the gao said 
at the two colorado sites nearly twothirds of the smoke dust 
and soot found in the air came from small sources not covered by 
the regulations the agency continued 
the gao recommended that the epa review air quality programs at 
more parks and wilderness areas and if similar situations are 
found ask congress to tighten the provisions so smaller and older 
sources of pollution are covered by the control requirements

taiwans justice chief said friday he will 
drop his challenge to president lee tenghui in this months 
presidential election defusing a crisis that threatened to split 
the ruling party 
the announcement leaves a clear path to election for lee who 
was endorsed last month as the official candidate of the ruling 
nationalist party 
the partys elder members are uncomfortable with lee a native 
taiwanese because they fear he does not share their intense desire 
to return to the chinese mainland and believe he is trying to amass 
too much power 
lin yangkang the popular 62yearold judiciary chief made the 
announcement he would drop from the race after a 20minute meeting 
with eight party veterans who lee had asked to find a resolution to 
the political battle 
i decided that i should not do anything to hurt the nation and 
peoples welfare lin told reporters afterward 
about 200 aging members of the electoral college had thrown 
their support behind lin for president and chiang wego the sole 
surviving son of nationalist leader chiang kaishek for vice 
president 
the 752seat electoral college known as the national assembly 
is dominated by politicians who fled the chinese mainland to taiwan 
with the rest of the nationalist government in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to communist forces 
they have not faced reelection since then frozen in office to 
support the nationalist governments claim to still be the 
legitimate ruler of all china 
lin said he would soon ask the elderly politicians to drop the 
idea of endorsing him i was told that people felt uneasy about 
the emergence of a second ticket in the election because it would 
force them to take sides 
the official radio reported that lee thanked lin for his 
decision the electoral college is expected to officially chose the 
president march 21 
lee 66 succeeded president chiang chingkuo when he died in 
office in 1987 the late president was another son of chiang 
kaishek 
china made a public expression of concern over the political 
bickering this week but it was not clear if those statements 
affected fridays developments beijing which seeks reunification 
with taiwan condemned the instability caused by the 
nationalist rift 
chiang wego viewed by many of the older assemblymen as the 
defender of their dream of returning to the mainland was not 
available friday for comment in the past he has said he would not 
actively campaign but would not discourage the electoral college 
from supporting him 
a fire meanwhile broke out in the national legislature friday 
and police blamed activists who want taiwan to drop its claim to be 
chinas legitimate government 
police said the early morning blaze may have been caused by 
firebombs several reception rooms were reported damaged 
nearby police discovered a fence painted with the slogan 
burn chinese pirates to death strive for taiwanese 
independence and bloodbath taiwan the references were 
apparently to elderly members of the yuan taiwans highest 
lawmaking body who fled mainland china decades ago 
less than an hour later a blaze occurred at the faculty 
dormitory at national taiwan university with similar slogans left 
behind 
no one was reported injured in either fire and there was no 
claim of responsibility 
also friday chiang hsiaowu son of late president chiang 
chingkuo said he would resign as head of taiwans mission to 
japan because he was disappointed over our leaders fighting over 
power without any regard to the nations future 
he criticized chiang wego for wanting to be elected but 
claiming he would not campaign but he said he would not waste 
my time to persuade his uncle to pull out of the race 
in an effort to placate his critics president lee said 
wednesday that party members would be consulted over whether he 
should continue as party chairman as well as head of government 
newspapers reported that lin backed by the aging conservatives 
wants lee to step down as party chairman to allow a collective 
leadership after the presidential election 
the 3yearold opposition democratic progressive party does not 
have enough members in the national assembly to nominate its own 
candidate for president it has demanded all the mainland chinese 
assemblymen retire and that the president be chosen by popular 
election

sperm banks keep records so detailed its 
unlikely a bank is to blame in the case of a white woman who says 
she was impregnated with a black mans sperm rather than her dying 
husbands experts said friday 
but if the nations three dozen major sperm banks are as safe as 
savings banks they arent nearly as regulated new york is the 
only state to license sperm banks and the federal government lacks 
control over them 
the issue arose this week after it was disclosed a new york 
woman is suing a fertility clinic and a sperm bank claiming her 
late husbands sperm was switched with that of a black man 
the woman says that after she was fertilized with the sperm she 
gave birth to a girl who appears to be half black 
david gould the attorney for the queens resident asked that 
her name be withheld because of emotional distress the girl now 
3 has been taunted because she doesnt look like her parents 
in 1985 the couple paid idant laboratories the nations oldest 
and largest commercial sperm bank to store the husbands sperm he 
had cancer and the couple feared chemotherapy could damage his 
sperm such concerns idant says account for about half its 
deposits 
the woman later contacted advanced fertility services to get the 
sperm samples from idant and use them for insemination 
advanced says the sperm it used came from idant idant says the 
sperm it sent was definitely the husbands and couldnt be the 
sperm that impregnated the wife 
dr jerome sherman chairman of american association of tissue 
banks reproductive council said sperm banks identification 
procedures are designed to avoid such confusion 
the chance of this happening is extremely remote if not 
impossible he said ive visited that facility idant and 
seen their identification procedures it couldnt be run any 
better as far as labeling is concerned 
it was much more likely he said that a woman lodging such a 
complaint had sexual intercourse with someone other than the sperm 
donor 
steven salzman another attorney for the woman denied shermans 
suggestion but said it was not yet clear if fault rested with the 
fertility clinic or the sperm bank 
at most sperm banks a man ejaculates into a container that is 
marked with his personal identification code and the date then it 
is tested divided into small units placed in small plastic 
straws and frozen 
the straws are lodged inside an aluminum container that looks 
like a cigar tube which also bears a label with the donors code 
it in turn is placed in a large tank of liquid nitrogen which 
keeps the sperm at minus 320 degrees 
meanwhile a log of the sperms history when how and where it 
was donated tested frozen and stored is compiled any 
withdrawal also is marked down an inventory of all sperm deposits 
is taken periodically 
in the case at issue idant says its records show the sperm it 
sent to the clinic was the husbands five straws are gone from 
his cigar tube and no one elses straws are missing and that a 
test showed the babys dna didnt match the husbands 
sherman a university of arkansas medicine professor who directs 
a sperm bank in little rock said his facility stores donor sperm 
of different races in different vaults idant uses colored plastic 
straws to indicate a donors race 
you have had situations where technicians have goofed and the 
semen was thawed but mixups like the one this woman claims 
never sherman said 
william andrews medical director of the american fertility 
society said the labeling errors that periodically complicate 
blood transfusions dont crop up in artificial inseminations 
because sperm banks arent responding to emergencies and have more 
time to double and crosscheck 
he also noted that since the vast majority of sperm samples are 
donated by whites the odds against a switch like the one alleged 
are particularly long 
given the absence of government regulation however consumers 
must be sure a sperm bank follows recordkeeping procedures 
recommended by the federal center for disease control and the 
fertility association 
mary anne gardineer of the state health department said the new 
york sperm bank regulations that took effect in october werent 
prompted by any problem but by a concern that inadequate screening 
of anonymous sperm donors might lead to the transmission of aids 
she said she had never heard of any mixup like the one alleged 
in the lawsuit but said her department would review the 
regulations to see if a more definitive identification of a donors 
sperm should be required 
her colleague dr jean linden concurred as in any other 
form of banking record keeping is very very important

massachusetts republicans long considered 
politically dead gathered friday for their state convention in an 
upbeat mood sensing a chance to win the governors race for the 
first time since 1970 
ron kaufman the republican national committeeman from 
massachusetts and an white house aide to president bush summed up 
expectations 
quite frankly i think the folks in washington for the first 
time really believe that the republican party can actually win this 
state he said 
the republicans have been boosted by democratic gov michael s 
dukakis heavy defeat in the 1988 presidential election and by the 
states financial woes 
the massachusetts miracle that dukakis used as a cornerstone 
of his campaign has evaporated 
the latest bad economic news came friday with the announcement 
that the states unemployment rate jumped from 45 percent to 53 
percent in february state government faces a budget deficit this 
year in excess of half a billion dollars 
polls show dukakis popularity has dropped to an alltime low 
although the governor is not seeking reelection kaufman and other 
gop leaders said they hope to channel dissatisfaction into votes 
for the gop in a state where democrats still outnumber republicans 
by 31 in party registration 
endorsements will be the major task facing the more than 5000 
delegates expected to attend the convention 
the delegates will vote saturday on who to support for governor 
lieutenant governor us senate and other statewide offices 
candidates need not win the endorsement to appear on the sept 
18 primary election ballot but must win support from a minimum of 
15 percent of the delegates 
the weeks before the convention have been marked by sharp 
campaign rhetoric between the partys two frontrunners in the 
governors race house minority leader steven pierce and former 
federal prosecutor william weld and between senate contenders dan 
daly and jim rappaport 
kaufman said he was not upset by the tough campaigning 
in terms of massachusetts politics whats been going on in our 
party is kind of weak kind of mild he said basically the 
whole things been a plus its been a good thing for our party 
he said it has boosted the name recognition of the candidates 
under republican rules if a candidate wins a super majority 
of the delegates a margin of 15 percent in a threeway race and 20 
percent in a twoway race the gop will provide aid before the 
primary 
but kaufman said he still would favor a primary election 
campaign 
ive always been in favor of a good primary kaufman said 
otherwise he said the democrats who hold their convention in 
june and are guaranteed a primary could dominate media coverage 
until after the primary and that could put the gop at a 
disadvantage he said 
the last time the republicans won the governors race was in 
1970 when francis sargent defeated kevin white dukakis defeated 
sargent in 1974 and has been in charge since except for a 
fouryear period when then democrat edward king defeated him in the 
primary and won the governorship 
since leaving office after losing to dukakis in 1982 king has 
switched to the gop

their lives are linked by a common memory a cool 
vietnamese river on a steamy day gunfire then chaos each thought 
the other had died 
but this weekend in st louis 21 years later the paths of jim 
lahr and denver lawson freeman cross once again 
lahr is to receive the bronze star for pulling his wounded 
buddy freeman and another marine from the rivers green waters to 
safety lahr was shot and paralyzed from the waist down as he 
returned to the river for a third wounded man 
one of the men rescued by lahr died the captain who that day 
began the paperwork to commend lahr was wounded in another raid the 
same week 
lahr believed freeman was dead freeman thought the same of lahr 
but at a marine corps reunion last summer freeman learned that 
lahr had survived and set out to see that his friend receive the 
honor he deserved 
that started the ball rolling marine sgt major wallace 
poyner said friday from st louis 
freeman started letters going and petitioned this they wrote 
it up sent it into the awards section of the marine corps and it 
went to the secretary of the navy who approved it 
the retired colonel who headed lahrs unit in vietnam was to 
present the award at a ceremony saturday poyner said 
on march 21 1969 while on patrol lahr freeman and other 
marines walked out of the jungle to fill their canteens at the 
river the citation says 
bullets and grenades began to fly and corporal lahr with 
complete disregard for his own safety assisted several marines 
to safety 
despite the heavy fire he made several trips until he 
himself was wounded and unable to continue the citation says 
freeman and his wife were en route friday from their home in 
south charleston wva to the ceremony said his mother juanita 
freeman 
my son was so excited about it this has really been a 
great lift in both of their lives mrs freeman said by telephone 
he knows he can never never repay jim but he feels that 
somehow now that he knows hes alive hell be able to do some 
things to return the favor to jim 
lahr downplayed his heroism during a telephone interview friday 
from his home in the central illinois community of lincoln 
i did it on an impulse said lahr who is confined to a 
wheelchair i knew there was danger involved but i went ahead 
like i said it was done on an impulse to get the men out of the 
area 
after he was wounded lahr recalls hearing one of his commanding 
officers call him by his nickname where ya at little bit 
but he remembers nothing more until he awoke on a hospital ship 
some days later 
his injury came 16 days before he completed his 13month tour in 
vietnam 
freeman also was seriously injured and remained in a fullbody 
cast for months his mother said 
they thought he was going to lose his life but oh he just 
came out great mrs freeman said honey listen i just thank 
god over and over for jim 
she said she met lahr this summer while he was visiting her son 
the first thing i told him i said i always hoped that 
someday i could tell you just how much we love you 
today lahr spends most of his time in activities with local 
veterans groups 
it feels real good he said of the upcoming ceremonies 
the bronze star i wish all the rest of them could get them 
too

a central bank official refused friday 
to confirm or deny president daniel ortegas statement that 
uncertainty over next months transfer of government to the united 
national opposition caused a run on banks 
but people reported their bank accounts were frozen and bank 
officials said earlier that funds simply werent there to cover 
withdrawals in dollars or cordobas the national currency 
the newly elected 14party uno coalition meanwhile issued a 
communique warning that giveaways of government property will be 
reviewed in detail to ascertain their legality and origin 
presumably once presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro and her 
government take over april 25 
it was referring to reports that government property from file 
folders to vehicles is being given away or sold off to leave uno an 
empty shell of a state structure and make it harder for the 
coalition to function as a government 
it also referred to a proposed law that would enable tenants of 
public housing to obtain legal ownership 
much of the property was confiscated from ousted dictator 
anastasio somoza and the people around him during the sandinistas 
10 years in power 
but other property was seized from sandinista critics who ran 
afoul of the government or from citizens who left nicaragua for 
more than six months 
the sandinistadominated national assembly is to vote on the law 
saturday 
ortega said thursday night that refusal of the ussupported 
contra rebels to disband before mrs chamorro is inaugurated was 
creating tensions 
concern over a peaceful transfer of power increased after ortega 
warned in his speech that there are thousands of weapons in the 
hands of the people and that he could not guarantee the 
situation will be normal come april 25 
ortega said jittery customers cleaned millions of dollars and 
billions of cordobas out of their bank accounts after uno defeated 
his sandinistas in national elections feb 25 
the black market rate for the cordoba is about 70000 to the 
dollar 
the prosandinista newspaper el nuevo diario ran a frontpage 
story friday that spoke of more than 100 million being withdrawn 
from bank accounts 
if he ortega says its so then im nobody to deny it 
said orlando mogollon banking services director at the central 
bank but when pressed mogollon backed off 
i cant confirm or deny it he said of the reported run on 
banks 
nicaraguas banking system is nationalized and controlled by the 
central bank 
emilio mayorga an official of the national development bank 
denied there was a run on his bank 
withdrawals are normal said mayorga we dont understand 
this thing about a drain on accounts 
a secretarial worker who tried this week to withdraw the 
equivalent of 300 from her savings account said she was told by a 
bank teller her account was frozen until may no further 
explanation was offered 
she admitted she wanted to have the cash because things have 
become so insecure 
a foreign diplomat reported that bank officials told him this 
week that there werent enough funds in an account from one of the 
best hotels in managua to cash a check for 500 
a private foreign citizen said officials at his bank told him he 
could not withdraw money from his dollar account because the bank 
lacked funds 
all three spoke on condition of anonymity 
one of two governmentcontrolled money exchange houses in 
managua shut down friday telephone calls to its offices were 
unanswered

the bush administration is preparing a 
nicaragua aid package focusing on agricultural help and is 
discussing moving the contra rebels to enclaves under united 
nations supervision officials on vice president quayles trip said 
friday 
the enclaves would provide an interim refuge for the contras to 
be safe from militant remnants of the sandinista army said one 
administration official 
that might be a way station to disarmament he said when 
asked whether the administration envisions having the contras keep 
their weapons in such camps 
the nicaragua aid package will be formally announced next week 
quayle said at a news conference following his meeting with 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
agricultural assistance providing such necessities as seed and 
fertilizer for the april planting season also will help the 
contras resettle in their homeland since most are from rural 
backgrounds said the first official 
quayle discussed with perez and spains prime minister felipe 
gonzalez the possibility of having the contras move into enclaves 
in nicaragua with united nations peacekeeping forces to separate 
the armies that have been warring for a decade the official said 
the future of the usbuilt contra army has been a key issue 
since the feb 25 election of opposition candidate violeta chamorro 
over sandinista president daniel ortega 
demobilizing the contras and a peaceful transfer of power were 
the chief topics of the meeting between quayle perez and gonzalez 
quayle and gonzalez are both on the way to sundays inauguration 
in chile which ortega will also attend 
perez and gonzalez pressed quayle very hard on the need to 
disband the contras at once said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
who is accompanying quayle to chile and was in fridays meetings 
the united states also wants the contras to disband before mrs 
chamorro is inaugurated on april 25 but the bush administration 
has insisted their security be insured 
the administration envisions the contras beginning to demobilize 
at the same time as the sandinistas relinquish their control of the 
army said the official who briefed reporters the sandinistas have 
been taking steps to retain control of some aspects of the 
government and ortega has said the sandinistas will keep control 
of the 70000man army central americas largest 
kennedy said he told perez and gonzalez there was heavy 
skepticism in congress about ortegas willingness to turn the 
government over to mrs chamorro 
participants in the meeting hosted by perez at his summer 
beachfront home said there were disagreements over whether ortega 
could be trusted 
quayle who said he spoke to mrs chamorro from air force two on 
friday morning held that he would rather put his trust in her 
the us official who briefed reporters said perez was looking 
into the possibility of having his government join the un 
peackeeping force that already is assigned to nicaragua 
the us officials did not disclose how much aid president bush 
will propose for nicaragua 
chamorros government has said it needs some 200 to 300 
million to get nicaraguas ailing economiy back on track 
after the meeting and news conference quayle flew to barbados 
for talks with caribbean heads of state and is flying on saturday 
to chile 
earlier quayle aides had said they anticipated the perez 
meeting would also focus on bushs push for latin governments to 
recognize the usinstalled government of panama but that did not 
come up said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
perez was one of the regions most vocal critics of the dec 20 
invasion which was widely deplored in the latin world 
thanks in part to diplomatic effots by perez however recent 
days have seen restoration of normal ties with panama by venezuela 
argentina colombia ecuador and peru said beckwith 
their actions came after president guillermo endara on march 1 
called for a national vote on changes he proposed to panamas 
constitution that along with withdrawal of the us invasion 
troops by midfebruary was seen as fulfilling calls by panamas 
neighbors for an election to give endaras government an electoral 
stamp of approval 
the countries that are still holding out against recognizing 
endara are brazil uruguay mexico and chile said beckwith

the parliament of the soviet republic of georgia 
on friday condemned its forcible annexation to the soviet union 
more than a halfcentury ago and demanded talks on restoration of 
its independence a local news agency reported 
georgia thus becomes the fourth of the 15 soviet republics after 
the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia to take action 
condemning its being incorporated into the soviet union 
lithuanias parliament is expected to vote on a formal 
declaration of independence on sunday 
the georgian parliament called the supreme soviet also 
condemned the proposal made by mikhail s gorbachev to create a 
strong soviet presidency according to tass and a transcript of the 
resolution read to the associated press over the telephone by the 
independent news agency of georgia 
tass in its foursentence report said nothing about the sections 
of the resolution condemning the red armys occupation of georgia 
in february 1921 and the subsequent treaties that made georgia part 
of the soviet union 
georgia has long had an active independence movement but has 
not pushed its case through parliamentary means many georgian 
independence leaders said that would be tacit admission of soviet 
power even though the baltics have won greater autonomy and edged 
closer to independence by using gorbachevs reforms to elect 
trusted local leaders 
according to the georgian independent news agency the 
resolutions text says the supreme soviet of georgia denounces 
the occupation and annexation of georgia by soviet russia and 
considers it to be an international crime it calls the entrance 
of troops a military interference intervention and occupation 
with the aim of overthrowing the existing political order 
it is necessary to start talks on restoration of an 
independent state of georgia the resolution says 
the southern caucasus republic has 5 million residents georgia 
mountainous and on the eastern shore of the black sea first became 
a part of the russian empire in the early 1800s it was briefly 
independent again after the bolshevik revolution 
last april soviet troops armed with gas and shovels killed 19 
proindependence demonstrators while chasing them off the main 
street of georgias capital tbilisi 
the georgian resolution also says it is inadmissible to 
adopt the section of the law that allows the president to declare a 
state of emergency and martial law and to introduce an 
authoritarian presidential rule which may be interpreted as the 
presidents right to remove organs of power in a union republic and 
thus to completely eliminate the republics sovereignty 
gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendment 
in mondays special session of the congress of peoples deputies 
despite progressives complaints that the draft would give him 
dictatorial powers 
the georgian resolution says it is inadmissible for the 
republics deputies to participate in approving the draft 
the resolution also says presidential measures taken to protect 
the nations territorial unity should not conflict with the 
realization of a republics right to secede from the ussr 
lithuania moved up its vote on declaring independence to sunday 
precisely because activists fear gorbachev will use his new powers 
to forcibly prevent them from splitting from the soviet union

the state house approved a bill friday that 
would give idaho the nations most restrictive abortion law and 
antiabortion activists the test they want for a us supreme court 
stand on the issue 
the measure passed 4736 and was forwarded to the senate after 
more than three hours of sometimes emotional debate witnessed by 
antiabortion and prochoice advocates packing the house gallery 
the bill is scheduled to face a hearing wednesday in the senate 
state affairs committee it could come to a final floor vote as 
early as friday and even opponents concede it stands a good chance 
of passing 
the bill like legislation rejected in minnesota and utah would 
outlaw abortion as a method of birth control 
the measure allows abortions only in cases of rape incest 
profound and irremediable fetal disabilities or to save the 
life or prevent severe and longlasting physical health damage 
to the mother 
sponsors contend that would prevent more than 90 percent of the 
approximately 1600 abortions performed each year in idaho 
penalties for civil contempt up to 10000 for a first 
offense 30000 for a second and 50000 for each additional 
violation could be assessed against any physician performing or 
attempting to perform an abortion but women undergoing the 
procedure would not be held legally responsible 
gov cecil andrus has not commented on the bill but he has come 
out strongly against abortion except in cases of rape incest and a 
threat to the life of the mother 
along with a pennsylvania antiabortion law which has been 
partially blocked by a federal court injunction the idaho bill 
would be the most restrictive in the nation according to its 
sponsors and the national right to life committee 
im just so proud that idahoans are taking the lead in 
returning protection to our unborn children said kerry uhlenkott 
of grangeville legislative coordinator for right to life of idaho 
inc the supreme court is inviting us to send up legislation and 
thats what were doing 
proabortion forces were disappointed that legislators ignored 
arguments that the measure would not pass constitutional muster 
and that most idaho residents want the legislature to stay out of 
the issue said a spokeswoman for the idaho group freedom means 
choice 
i consistently heard the word morality used always ascribed 
to the life of the unborn said sally trott i never heard it 
used in reference to the states obligation if its going to coerce 
a woman to carry a pregnancy to term 
on thursday the house approved and sent the senate legislation 
repealing the states controversial trigger law which sets 
criminal penalties including prison terms up to five years both for 
physicians performing and women receiving abortions 
the trigger statute would have taken effect only if the us 
supreme court ever completely overturns its 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing the procedure through the first two trimesters 
of pregnancy 
after nearly 17 years of relative inactivity on abortion idaho 
got back into the fray after last julys us supreme court ruling 
in a missouri case 
the case webster vs reproductive health services effectively 
invited more strident challenges of the underlying law created by 
roe vs wade antiabortion advocates contend 
the july decision was the focus of fridays debate we ought 
not to fall victim to the idea that this bill is 
unconstitutional said rep l ed brown a republican who is the 
primary house sponsor no one knows whats constitutional in this 
case 
but opponents cited objections raised by richard wilkins a 
brigham young university law professor who is antiabortion but 
contends the birth control bill goes too far in challenging the 
supreme courts stand he said it would be found unconstitutional 
on a number of grounds 
i am honestly and geniunely convinced that if we pass this 
bill it will hurt the prolife movement that it will be struck 
down said democratic rep patricia mcdermott a pocatello 
attorney

a physician who maintains she contracted aids 
from a contaminated needle settled her lawsuit for 135 million in 
an agreement negotiated with the city hospital agency the trial 
judge revealed friday 
veronica prego 32 will receive twothirds of the award or 
900000 when it is paid by the city in about two weeks the 
remainder will go to the lawyers who represented her 
after a trial that lasted more than two months prego 
unexpectedly dropped her lawsuit and agreed to the outofcourt 
settlement as the jury was scheduled to hear closing arguments the 
settlement was announced thursday 
prego was unavailable friday for comment on the settlement one 
of her lawyers said 
the day before prego said she would use the money to help her 
family and to provide for her medical expenses in the tough days 
ahead 
brooklyn state justice aaron d bernstein on friday reversed his 
order to participants not to disclose the amount after the new york 
post sued to have the settlement unsealed 
the judge said he had issued the gag order to spare prego the 
embarrassment of being questioned by reporters about why she 
settled for such a seemingly small sum 
it was something that touched a chord with dr prego she 
didnt want people to think that the value of the case was that 
little bernstein said 
i didnt want dr prego to be questioned about the reason she 
took that amount of money when she sued for so much more he said 
prego initially sought 175 million when she sued the city 
health and hospitals corp and two physicians but the dollar 
figure was later removed from the lawsuit filed two years ago 
in her lawsuit prego contended she had developed aids after 
puncturing her finger with a contaminated needle carelessly left 
amid soiled refuse on a patients bed at kings county hospital 
bernstein who considered the agreement fair said prego 
reluctantly agreed to settle because she didnt want the case to be 
tied up in the courts any longer 
hospitals corp lawyers had promised they would appeal if the 
jury found for prego and an appeal could take two years or more 
during the trial pregos personal physician said she might have 
less than a year to live 
its our belief they played hardball with a dying woman one 
of pregos lawyers susan m karten said im happy for her its 
over im relieved im just sorry for what she went through 
she said prego was ready to settle for a lesser sum before 
filing her negligence lawsuit two years ago but the city refused 
the hospitals corp said it was pleased with the settlement

oliver north testified friday that john m 
poindexter overrode his misgivings and let him be questioned by 
lawmakers about covert aid to nicarguan rebels something that 
could not be revealed to anyone 
the former white house aide testifying as a reluctant leadoff 
witness at the irancontra trial of his boss and national security 
adviser to president reagan admitted he lied when questioned by 
house members about whether he was covertly helping arm the 
nicaraguan contras 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel declared a hostile 
witness by the judge insisted that no one ever told me to lie to 
congress about the covert operation to help the rebels after 
congress shut off money 
but north said that when he told poindexter his misgivings about 
attending the meeting he was told you can handle it you can 
take care of it 
north said he was concerned by the kind of questions they 
might ask because id been told by two national security 
adviers and their deputys by the director of central intelligence 
that that information was not to be revealed to anyone 
north said i didnt walk into the meeting intending to lie 
but the former national security council aide staff officer 
admitted that he did not tell the truth during aug 6 1986 
session with members of the house permanent select committee on 
intelligence 
i recall deceiving them about the full measure of my 
involvement said north 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral who was national 
security adviser for president reagan in 1986 is accused among 
other things of putting north up to lying at the meeting 
compelled to testify by irancontra prosecutors north conceded 
few points without a struggle during a day of relentless 
questioning by prosecutor dan webb 
when congress banned us military aid to the rebels north said 
he was told in so many words he was responsible for the 
contras north said he kept poindexter fully informed of his work 
to help buy and ship arms to the rebels 
north reluctantly admitted he supervised the armssupply 
operation put together by retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord 
at no time as you were running your operation you never 
tried to conceal or hide what you were doing from either admiral 
poindexter or robert mcfarlane webb asked the second reference 
being to poindexters predecessor 
i did not north said 
were you ever trying to direct that operation on you own 
independent of your superiors webb asked 
never north replied 
didnt you keep them apprised of all of your contrarelated 
activities webb asked 
yes north said 
poindexter who succeeded mcfarlane in late 1985 is charged 
with conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts 
of making false statements the charges concern accusations that he 
tried to cover up norths military assistance and fund raising for 
the contras as well as white house knowledge of a 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran 
one obstruction of congress count relates to poindexters 
assurances in july 21 1986 letters to three legislative committees 
that his staff was in compliance with the spirit and letter of 
the law restricting contra aid 
it was sent two months after north warned poindexter in a memo 
that the secret operation was becoming more visible to curious 
lawmakers with the infusion of 6 million in profits from the us 
arms sales to iran 
north testified that poindexter while he was mcfarlanes 
deputy was among those who told him to work to provide assistance 
to the nicaraguan contras as congress was shutting off direct us 
military aid 
poindexter told you you were becoming the person who would 
replace the cia as the source of military support for the 
contras he was asked 
i dont want to put those words in his mouth north said 
but in that general time frame he was one of the persons 
you were told were you not that you were supposed to go fund 
and arm the contras webb asked 
in so many words yes north said but he disputed webbs 
suggestion that he set up an enterprise with secord and others 
to buy and ship arms to the contras 
it began as something small it evolved over time north 
said 
webb asked north if he could recall the late cia director 
william casey telling him the ball is in your hands after 
congress shut off funds for the rebels 
in words to that effect north replied 
north earlier convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction 
of congress and destroying or altering key irancontra documents 
testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution 
but the former marine was clearly uncomfortable taking the 
witness stand against his former boss frequently professing 
ignorance or forgetfulness of conversations with poindexter and of 
key points from testimony north had previously given 
us district judge harold greene frequently overruled defense 
objections that the prosecutor was asking the witness leading 
questions calling north a hostile witness trying to be loyal 
to poindexter 
webb repeatedly produced sworn testimony that north had given in 
the past that he gave orders to secord directing the resupply 
operation from the white house 
north initially resisted the suggestion he was directly in 
charge saying under my direction would be saying a major 
general worked for a lieutenant colonel i dont think thats 
correct 
but when confronted with his own words from a transcript north 
admitted that during his trial last year he said he gave secord 
orders and ran the operation from washington 
did you give him direction and guidance webb said 
i gave him a lot of requests if you want to call it direction 
and guidance i guess thats what were stuck with north said

the united states and soviet union have 
joined forces to try to get emergency food supplies into ethiopia 
where up to 5 million people are in danger of starvation a us 
lawmaker said friday 
thomas foglietta dpa said us and soviet officials are 
pressuring leaders of two rebel movements in northern ethiopia and 
the marxistgovernment to allow safe passage of relief supplies 
there is action a cooperative action between the soviet union 
and the united states of america to get this accomplished 
foglietta said at a news conference there has been some movement 
along those lines 
he said he could not provide details of the joint efforts 
calling them extremely secretive and classified 
earlier friday foglietta and byron dorgan dnd met with 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to press for 
increased international help to provide famine relief in ethiopia 
we are very concerned that the people of ethiopia face their 
third famine in seven years foglietta said five million 
people are at risk of starvation but they will not just die of 
hunger they will die because of politics unless we can persuade 
the warring parties to let the food through 
dorgan said we will see dire consequences unless somehow the 
international community is mobilized to say to those fighting in 
that region and to say to others who are capable of helping that we 
cannot allow this kind of tragedy to happen in the world 
foglietta said ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam is 
reluctant to give too much leeway into the situation fearing 
that it would hurt him militarily 
so thats what we have we have a conflict between the 
military interest between these various groups and the humanitarian 
interest that we have he said 
foglietta said ethiopians have started to migrate because there 
is no food available in some areas relief agencies try to prevent 
mass migrations because it adds to the hardships for 
faminestricken people and makes it more difficult to reach them if 
arrangements are made for shipments into the troubled areas 
rebels in the northern ethiopian provinces of eritrea and tigre 
seeking autonomy have been fighting the marxist government in addis 
ababa for years 
in 198485 up to 1 million people starved to death in tigre and 
eritrea in 198788 a massive international relief operation 
prevented a similar tragedy during another crop failure 
the us agency for international development the foreign aid 
branch of the state department has estimated 750000 metric tons 
of emergency food are needed in ethiopia this year

a small university that announced it had 
enough money to offer scholarships to black freshmen was flooded 
with calls from far more students than it can serve school 
officials said friday 
florida atlantic university officials said they were having 
trouble explaining to callers from across the country that they 
planned to expand the tuition aid program to just 45 spots in the 
fall up from 30 last year 
we got a mass of calls from people who said they are angry 
said james spear executive assistant to anthony catanese 
president of the state university 
a news report which was carried by the associated press on 
thursday said all the black freshmen who met admission standards 
at fau would be offered free tuition 
the report did not note the number of scholarships available 
but in it officials spoke of expanding the program and seeking 
donations from the community if demand surpassed expectations 
spear says the school probably could have met the goal of giving 
all black freshmen scholarships this fall based on earlier numbers 
of black applications for scholarships 
but the 11500student school cannot take an endless line of 
applicants who might respond after their program got national 
notice spear said 
the 1350 scholarship covers tuition and fees but doesnt pay 
for housing books and other expenses 
outofstate students can apply but florida residents get 
preference under the program which will be financed with school 
funds and private donations 
based on the number of scholarships awarded last year and the 
number of black freshmen expected officials believed there was 
plenty of money so every every qualified black applicant to get a 
scholarship spear said 
its almost a catch22 spear said we offered 30 martin 
luther king scholarships last year as a part of our overall 
scholarship programs we had 28 black freshmen apply who met our 
admission standards 
he said the school is doing the best it can to attract and hold 
the top high school graduates from south florida 
officials were shocked when they started getting calls from as 
far away as denver and toronto some callers wanted to apply but 
others were angry 
one caller said im black and my wife is white does that 
mean we pay 50 percent spear said 
on the bright side spear noted the attention could attract some 
bright students from outside the area 
said the spokesman we got a milliondollar pr campaign

you look at the stripes and youre automatically 
intimidated responded coalition member holgar streu why not 
put up flags on the day of the festival why do they have to leave 
the stripes all year 
in a message to mayor joseph r paolino jr two weeks ago the

tradition makes providence the great city it is they should 
realize the intent of the pride that the italians have in the

from a tournament in israel on friday to face charges that he and 
his brother shot their millionaire parents to death friends and 
relatives said 
erik menendez 19 who with his brother is heir to a 14 million 
estate left a house in a tel aviv suburb friday morning saying he 
was going to bengurion international airport said his israeli 
host who asked not to be identified 
his 22yearold brother lyle was arrested thursday and held 
without bail he was expected to be arraigned monday on murder 
charges with special circumstance counts that potentially 
carry the death penalty district attorneys spokeswoman sandi 
gibbons said 
erik will be arraigned on identical charges if he returns or is 
captured ms gibbons said 
jose menendez 45 and his wife mary louise kitty menendez 
44 were slain aug 20 in their 5 million spanishstyle beverly 
hills mansion 
in another development friday the los angeles times reported 
that erik menendez once cowrote a screenplay with a high school 
buddy about a pampered 18yearold who murders his rich parents and 
three other people 
the boys had reported finding the bodies after returning from a 
night out the slayings were so bloody and clues so scarce that 
many in hollywood believed they were message murders by 
mobsters menendez had crossed in the course of his business 
an uncle carlos baralt said the family finds it inconceivable 
the sons could have killed their parents he said he spoke briefly 
by phone with erik on thursday i think what he would like to do 
is be permitted to present himself rather than be arrested and be 
brought in in chains 
menendez a cuban who fled the castro regime with little money 
wound up the chairman of live entertainment a video distributor 
and retailer affiliated with carolco pictures carolco is 
bestknown for the rambo movies 
friends including former california lt gov mike curb said 
menendez made it to top jobs at rca hertz and live through 
tenacity and aggressiveness that sometimes rubbed people the wrong 
way 
his sons shared his good looks and selfconfidence but had it 
easier they grew up loving the good life attending a private 
school in new jersey touring the amateur tennis circuit lyle 
attended princeton university bought a condominium near the 
campus and dreamed of owning a string of restaurants 
eric cowrote a 66page screenplay two years ago that opens with 
the 18yearold protagonist hamilton cromwell reading a will that 
bestows 157 million on him hamilton smiles sadistically the 
script states 
cromwells five victims are found frozen in a basement after 
which a friend shoots cromwell to death cromwells taperecorded 
voice is played later at a trial you must understand that 
the price a player pays for failure in the game of life is death 
beverly hills police chief marvin d iannone said thursday that 
detectives had circumstantial evidence against the sons early on in 
the investigation he said the sevenmonth investigation uncovered 
physical evidence that showed the sons were the trigger men 
the family had been undergoing counseling and a key break came 
thursday with the seizure of records of the psychologist such 
seizures are allowed only rarely under california law protecting 
patienttherapist relationships 
lyle menendezs lawyer gerald chaleff said he would probably 
object strongly to the search although he hadnt seen the 
paperwork justifying the warrants chaleff also said he expects 
erik to turn himself in 
under terms of the parents wills made nine years ago the sons 
were to share the estate if both parents died at the same time a 
400000 life insurance policy already has been distributed to them

a group that won federal approval of tests 
for a potential aids drug made from a chinese plant has received a 
250000 grant from a pharmaceutical giant officials announced 
friday 
the grant for further study of compound q came from sandoz 
usa a company based in hanover nj officials of project 
inform told a news conference 
but the us food and drug administrations decision to allow 
testing of a purified form of the drug confirmed by an fda source 
thursday was criticized by dr donald abrams a member of the 
fdas antiviral drugs advisory committee 
im thinking of resigning from the committee said abrams 
the assistant aids director at san francisco general hospital he 
called the groups original underground study unorthodox and 
said he was concerned about safety 
a group of doctors organized by project inform nine months ago 
started their own study without fda approval in an effort to 
determine if the drug was effective in battling the aids virus once 
it infected the body 
the group smuggled the drug trichosanthin made from a 
cucumberlike plant from china and administered it to about 60 
people in san francisco los angeles new york and miami 
the groups leaders claimed they couldnt wait for the 
government stamp of approval saying aids patients were desperate 
and already were experimenting with the drug 
project informs codirector martin delaney said the new study 
would involve glq223 a compound q drug made by genelabs a small 
private company in redwood city calif 
delaney said the american drug and the one from china were 
pharmaceutically identical 
however he said using the genelab product would allow 
researchers improved quality control he added that controls were 
more than adequate at the plant in shanghai but there was a 
possibility it could be harmed in transit 
the new study will administer glq223 to about 100 patients 
recruited in the same cities where the underground test was held 
the original compound q program effectively determined the 
basic safety profile of this drug in record time and has provided 
the only public information to date about the effects of the 
drug said delaney 
delaney and terry beswick an administrator of the study said 
critics of the fda action were taking potshots and forming 
opinions without knowing all the facts

a former tanker captain said friday 
that joseph hazelwood gave a virtuoso performance commanding the 
exxon valdez in the hours before the tanker struck a reef and 
unleashed the nations worst oil spill 
hazelwood set everything up beautifully before leaving the 
bridge under the control a third mate to do some paperwork the 
former captain shiras walker testified at hazelwoods criminal 
trial 
walker testifying for the defense suggested there shouldnt 
have been any problem clearing jagged bligh reef if hazelwoods 
orders to make a turn had been carried out 
it was a very gentle turn walker said he had plenty of 
sea room 
questioned further on the central issue on hazelwoods criminal 
trial the witness said he left proper instructions with his 
mate he gave a lawful command to the third mate to call him when 
he made the turn that was capt hazelwoods check to make sure the 
turn was made 
walker noted that the third mate did as he was told and called 
the captain 
what would a call like that tell you asked attorney michael 
chalos 
it would put me at ease said walker who noted that the 
turn order given to the helmsman was a very simple thing its 
even easier than steering some cars 
after the ship grounded on the reef march 24 spilling almost 11 
million gallons of alaska crude oil into prince william sound 
hazelwood continued to act properly walker testified 
i would have done exactly what capt hazelwood did walker 
said crediting hazelwood with thinking more clearly than he would 
have expected after a grounding 
ive been through groundings walker said the feeling is 
equivalent to being punched in the stomach and im talking about a 
onetotwo barrel spill not something of this magnitude to bear 
up under that its amazing 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of criminal mischief and misdemeanor counts of reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil he faces up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines if convicted on all charges 
in an unexplained development friday superior court judge karl 
johnstone dismissed a woman juror and replaced her with a male 
alternate during a secret session with lawyers for both sides that 
lasted nearly an hour 
johnstone refused to disclose why the juror had been excused 
telling reporters only i released a juror and its not a 
big deal 
walker testified that hazelwood did nothing unusual in boarding 
his ship just 45 minutes before departure 
as for hazelwoods decision to go below while a local pilot 
guided the ship through the valdez narrows walker said that too 
was routine 
on most of the ships i pilot the captain is below walker 
said i find no fault there there are no regulations on where he 
has to be he could be anywhere he wants to be 
walker said when he was in command of tankers in the valdez 
area he operated under the belief the coast guard monitored his 
movements from its traffic control center there 
they spent 70 million to build that place to warn you of 
collisions and groundings walker said 
he indicated that if there was ice in the area and a ship left 
the normal traffic lanes he believed the coast guard would monitor 
even more closely than normal

the council of national unity voted 
friday to increase ethnic minority representation in romanias 
first freely elected parliament since 1937 while restricting the 
role of the military 
the council the makeshift parliament running the country until 
elections debated the draft electoral law governing the may 20 
elections for a 331seat twochamber parliament 
debate was at times boisterous in the vaulted neoclassical 
amphitheater where dictator nicolae ceausescus rubberstamp 
national assembly once met 
ceausescu was ousted and then executed last december in the wave 
of reforms that washed over eastern europe 
we have to put an end to this provisional stage we are in 
interim president ion iliescu said friday in response to calls to 
delay any vote on the electoral law until a new constitution is 
promulgated 
the constitution is to be worked out by the new parliament 
the draft electoral law provides for the military high command 
to fill by appointment 15 seats in the new parliament in 
recognition of the militarys role in supporting the revolution 
but council members voted by a show of hands to confine the 
military seats to the weaker lower house of parliament the 
assembly of deputies and exclude them from the senate 
the draft law had provided for parliamentary representation only 
for ethnic minorities able to garner 20000 votes but the council 
voted to set aside seats for the 13 officially recognized ethnic 
groups the largest being the hungarians and germans 
council member varujan vosgarian a member of the armenian 
minority said in appealing for broader minority representation 
we were about 100000 we lived in romania for many centuries 
after the dictatorship only 7000 remained if you dont vote for 
us to get a seat that means that you deny our role as martyrs 
much of the nations armenian population perished in stalinist 
labor camps after world war ii 
the draft law provides for a mixture of direct election of 
candidates and proportional representation to reflect geographical 
regions as well as the more than 50 parties 
most of them are small groupings that have sprung up in the 
aftermath of the december revolution which ended ceausescus 
24year stalinist rule 
earlier friday prime minister petre roman predicted it will 
take five years to completely unravel romanias communistimposed 
centralized economy and convert to a modern free market system 
he outlined the provisional governments recovery plan for an 
economy that has been starved of already relatively scarce consumer 
goods since 1980 when ceausescu began a huge export program to pay 
off romanias national debt and finance his own grandiose 
construction schemes 
the staterun economy is still reeling from a drain on 
resources the most basic consumer goods such as fruit and 
underwear usually are available only on the black market 
a new law went into effect thursday to promote free enterprise 
by allowing the establishment of private companies with up to 20 
employees roman proposed raising the employee limit to 100 
roman said his interim government will maintain the freeze on 
basic commodity prices to avoid economic dislocation but prices of 
unprocessed agricultural products should be allowed to float freely 
he said that in an effort to boost agriculture the export of

the vermont supreme court has upheld the 
1988 drug conviction of john zaccaro jr the son of former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
in a unanimous decision released friday the court rejected 
claims by zaccaros attorneys that his conviction for possessing 
and selling cocaine should be reversed the justices rejected 
arguments that among other things the 1986 undercover police 
operation was conducted illegally and zaccaro was the victim of 
selective prosecution because of his mothers fame 
while the officers involved acknowledged awareness of the fact 
that defendant is the son of a public figure there is no 
indication that this was a motivating factor in the states 
decision to prosecute defendant associate justice ernest w 
gibson wrote in the decision 
vermont attorney general jeffrey amestoy said he was pleased 
with the courts decision 
what you had here was somebody intending to sell drugs who got 
caught amestoy said its clear from the courts opinion that 
the legal arguments of the defendant were without bearing 
kathleen sullivan a harvard law school professor who 
represented zaccaro during the appeal said the main issue in the 
appeal was the entry into zaccaros home by an undercover state 
trooper 
were very disappointed that the vermont supreme court didnt 
realize the importance of protecting the home from undercover 
searches sullivan said this is something that affects all the 
citizens of the state of vermont 
sullivan also disagreed with the courts ruling on the selective 
prosecution issue 
we all know that john zaccaro would have been in less trouble 
if he had not been the son of a famous lady sullivan said 
sullivan said the family had not yet determined whether further 
legal action will be taken 
zaccaro then a student at middlebury college was arrested feb 
20 1986 at his middlebury home after selling 25 worth of cocaine 
to an undercover vermont state trooper the trooper a woman had 
been invited into zaccaros home by his roommate 
zaccaro was convicted of possession and sale of a regulated drug 
in april 1988 and sentenced to onetofive years in prison 
in claiming that he was the victim of selective prosecution 
zaccaro said other middlebury college students had been caught 
using cocaine but had not been prosecuted testimony revealed that 
those students had been caught by middlebury college authorities 
who did not release the information to police 
defendant here has failed to meet his burden of showing that 
others who were similarly situated were not prosecuted the 
justices said 
the court also denied zaccaros claims that his right to a fair 
trial was violated when the district court allowed testimony based 
on suppressed evidence and that the judges instructions to the 
jury on entrapment were erroneous 
zaccaro actually served three months under house arrest the 
sentence was criticized when it became known zaccaro was serving 
the sentence in a 1500amonth burlington apartment with maid 
service 
zaccaro also completed more than 500 hours of community service 
by working at the king street youth center for troubled youth 
his mother was the 1984 democratic vicepresidential nominee

the head of the federal aviation 
administration lifted the licenses friday of three northwest 
airlines crew members accused of flying under the influence of 
alcohol 
the three were arrested when their boeing 727 with 91 passengers 
aboard arrived in minneapolis from fargo nd on thursday 
james busey administrator of the faa said in a statement 
announcing the emergency revocation of the licenses of the pilot 
copilot and second officer that we will take equally forceful 
action against any other airman who violates the agencys 
regulations against alcohol 
safety and alcohol do not mix busey said 
violations of the agencys alcohol rules is not common at 
all said faa spokesman bob buckhorn he said he could not 
remember the last instance 
buckhorn said busey acted after the three crew members were 
reported by an faa inspector to have been flying within eight hours 
of drinking being under the influence of alcohol and having blood 
alcohol concentrations greater than 004 percent 
the three have the right to appeal within 10 days to the 
national transportation safety board names of the three have not 
been released 
bob gibbons spokesman for northwest said in eagan minn that 
the airline was still conducting its own investigation to see 
whether the crew had violated the companys rule against drinking 
within 12 hours before a flight 
the net effect of the license revocations is not awfully 
significant because we withdrew them from flying yesterday said 
gibbons 
upon the completion of our investigation they could be 
subjected to discipline which could be as severe as discharge from 
the company

officials from the two germanys met friday to 
prepare for international talks that will plot a course for 
reunification while trying to overcome problems rooted in decades 
of distrust 
the private meeting was the first stage of negotiations that 
ultimately are to involve leaders from east and west germany and 
the four victorious world war ii allies the united states soviet 
union britain and france 
ernst krabatsch east germanys deputy foreign minister met 
with dieter kastrup head of the political department at west 
germanys foreign ministry for 2 hours at a foreign ministry 
villa in a suburb of east berlin 
the two said they discussed procedural questions for talks 
planned wednesday in bonn where german officials will begin laying 
the groundwork for reunification they said they had pledged to 
keep details of the talks secret and refused to comment further 
under the formula agreed to last month the two german nations 
will first discuss the domestic aspects of unification before 
consulting with the allies about security issues 
the allies have given their blessing to the idea of german 
unification but enormous problems need to be worked out in 
particular the soviet unions insistence that a united germany not 
be a member of nato in addition poland is insisting on a role in 
the talks 
the meeting in bonn is slated to be lowlevel no definite 
results are expected to emerge until after elections march 18 in 
east germany the first free elections in the nations history 
the official adn news agency reported friday that 24 political 
parties will take part in the elections it quoted election 
commission spokeswoman petra blaess as saying the final roster 
includes the party for democratic socialism which used to be the 
communist party the social democrats the liberal free democrats 
and the alliance for germany a conservative coalition backed by 
west german chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic union 
smaller parties such as alliance 90 the environmentalist 
greens the independent womens league and oddballs like the german 
beer drinkers union were also accepted by the election commission 
east germanys voters will choose a new parliament with 400 
members 100 fewer than the current peoples chamber 
the leftist social democrats are favorites to win a majority 
but the threeparty alliance for germany boosted by campaign 
appearances by kohl and other west german conservatives has jumped 
from a 17 percent share of support to more than 30 percent in 
recent opinion polls 
however the alliances chances could be hurt by accusations 
that wolfgang schnur a top candidate from the alliances 
democratic awakening party was a longtime informer of the hated 
state security police 
schnur denied the charges made by a citizens investigative 
commission thursday and alliance members friday backed his claims 
of innocence 
but karlernst eppler rostock chairman of democratic awakening 
recommended friday that in the interests of the party schnur 
should not be a candidate 
the communists despite the name change and personal popularity 
of interim premier hans modrow are expected to fare badly with no 
other leftleaning party willing to form a coalition with them 
the elections will give the new government a popular mandate to 
negotiate terms of unification with west germany and the allies 
president wojciech jaruzelski of poland and his premier tadeusz 
mazowiecki met with french president francois mitterrand in paris 
on friday to rally french backing for polands demands to 
participate in the talks 
their demand is based on fears that a united germany might try 
to reclaim about a third of poland that was german territory before 
world war ii 
after fridays talks mitterrand endorsed the polish demand for 
an accord fixing their border but he stopped well short of calling 
for a full place for poland at the talks on reunification between 
the germanys and the four world war ii allies 
poland cannot be in the six that much is clear he said at 
a news conference he added warsaws role would be beside not 
within the process 
the two poles initially said they were pleased with the paris 
discussions but mazowiecki later said only full representation in 
the talks would soothe fears of his countrymen 
its not enough for us to be consulted but to take part in the 
discussions he said 
west germanys parliament agreed thursday that a united germany 
should honor polands present border but it apparently has not 
eased polands concerns 
the two germanys have formed the front between nato and the 
sovietled warsaw pact alliances for more than 40 years and a 
united germany would be a colossal country of more than 76 million 
people in strategically important central europe 
also friday east german public prosecutor hansjuergen joseph 
announced the release of former chief of the security police erich 
mielke on grounds of ill health adn reported 
mielke was jailed dec 8 on charges of abusing public office 
along with other former communist officials ousted in the fall 
revolution the charges against mielke were later upped to include 
high treason

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
on friday raised the possibility of a major role for un forces in 
efforts to disarm the nicaraguan rebels when he briefed the 
security council on developments there 
the private consultations focused on proposals to expand the 
mandate for the un observer group in central america un 
spokesman juan carlos brandt said 
the security council formed the 256member observer group known 
as onuca to verify the cutoff of aid to rebel movements and to 
patrol borders to keep guerrillas from launching attacks from other 
countries 
brandt said perez de cuellar will report to the 15member 
security council next week on the proposed heightened role for 
onuca 
the new mandate being discussed for onuca would have it play a 
key role in disarming the nicaraguan resistance forces and 
possibly their voluntary repatriation he said if the security 
council decides to give onuca that responsibility it would require 
significant increases in personnel and other resources 
the ussupported nicaraguan rebels are known as contras 
canadian ambassador yves fortier said after fridays 
consultations that there are some encouraging signs from 
nicaragua 
were talking about the demobilization of the contras both 
the men and equipment fortier said 
he said events in nicaragua are happening very rapidly 
there are lines of communication which are open the 
demobilization process under the supervision of the un is going 
forward 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has said armed citizens will 
fight the rebels if they do not disband before presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro takes office on april 25 mrs chamorro 
defeated ortega in presidential elections feb 25 
the contras have fought the sandinista government since 1981 
and ortega said they continue to launch attacks into nicaragua from 
camps in honduras 
both ortega and mrs chamorro called for the contras to disband 
before the inauguration but rebel leaders refused they said she 
must first take office and the new government be given control of 
the sandinista peoples army and the interior ministry forces 
the uncertainty over disbanding creates questions over how 
effective a unsponsored program to disarm the contras will be 
since it emphasizes the repatriation process is voluntary 
from following reports from the region one doesnt have a 
clear idea of whether they will or will not demobilize brandt 
said

for an investigation and recall of the onestep seat which it said 
had the highest injury and fatality rate in the industry 
the center also said was failing to enforce the recalls it did 
order 
evenflo tested the onestep following the allegations in december 
and concluded with great confidence that there was no problem 
said potter

said then that child safety seats were the single most effective 
safety device ever developed for an automobile 
federal auto safety officials did not return calls for comment

girl 
political sources said opposition parties were negotiating with

a prominent political and human rights activist 
a us embassy diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the united states was not involved in the talks 
we are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way 
involved with negotiations we are not putting together a deal it 
is up to haitians to decide if theres to be a change in 
government the diplomat said

country if avril does not step down by monday

gabriel volcy act as provisional leader until elections are held 
the parties have repeatedly said they want avril replaced for now 
with a supreme court judge 
avril who came to power in a soldiers revolt in september 
1988 has said he would be willing to step down if most haitians

revolution and chaos

out of the question he said

demand it but the peoples will can only be expressed through 
elections and not through disorder

feb 6 when the mayor was interviewing candidates for police 
chief he made the appointment 10 days later 
the mayor doesnt believe the timing was coincidence he told 
the boston globe daniels noted that police had taken an interest 
in his brother much earlier 
i firmly believe it was a setup daniels told the newspaper 
the mayor said he got several calls from the police department 
telling him there was a warrant for his brothers arrest and asking 
him what do you want us to do 
i shocked them daniels recalled saying he told police 
arrest my brother he is not above the law i want no coverup

an estimated 2 million people have been tested 
for aids in publicly funded programs and at least 6 percent were 
found to be among the million or so americans believed infected 
experts said thursday 
from 1985 to 1989 25 million tests for hiv the virus that 
causes aids were performed by 63 publicly funded prevention 
programs across the country the centers for disease control 
reported 
of the tests given 149639 or 6 percent were positive 
considering that between 12 percent and 30 percent of aids tests 
are apparently repeat tests that leaves an estimated 2 million 
people tested with 123000 or 6 percent to 145000 of them 
infected the cdc said 
one of the things that surprises me is how many people have 
elected to learn their aidsvirus antibody status and what they 
can do to protect themselves said dr stephen bowen deputy 
director for hiv in the cdcs center for prevention services 
many of the estimated 1 million people overall infected with hiv 
are unaware of their infection the atlantabased cdc said in its 
weekly report 
out of more than 1 million people tested in the last two years 
whose aids risk groups were known 44 percent were heterosexuals at 
risk including those with highrisk partners or multiple sex 
partners and 29 percent were heterosexuals who reported no aids 
risk factors but were tested anyway 
fourteen percent were homosexual or bisexual men who make up 
the largest group of aids victims and 9 percent were heterosexual 
intravenous drug abusers the secondleading aids risk group 
positivetest rates were highest for gay men who abused 
injectable drugs 17 percent of such test subjects were told they 
were infected the gay or bisexual men tested were infected at a 
rate of 165 percent 
health officials dont have a real good handle on the number 
of people who have been tested at private physicians offices not 
participating in the publicly funded aids programs bowen said 
such tests are not necessarily reported to health officials 
more than 120000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states with more than 72000 deaths the cdc recommended efforts 
to ensure that even more people with undetected hiv infections 
receive testing and counseling

tempting bryan said in a floor speech he vowed to renew his 
push for higher standards later either as a separate bill or as 
part of a package aimed at reducing the threat of global warming 
supporters described bryans move as a tactical retreat made 
necessary by last weeks cleanair deal between the senate 
leadership and the bush administration a deal to which many 
senators are committed even though they might otherwise back bryan 
the compromise deleted the fuel economy provision included in 
the bill as approved by a committee last fall 
the bottom line here is were going to come back and fight the 
auto industry in a couple of months said daniel becker lobbyist 
for the sierra club 
auto allies aware that the fuel economy battle is far from 
over reacted guardedly 
sen carl levin dmich reiterated his view that the fuel 
efficiency standards should not be linked with the clean air bill 
because the environmental issue at stake is global warming not air 
pollution 
improved fuel efficiency would lessen autos emissions of carbon 
dioxide a major cause of global warming 
when congress considers a global warming bill all sources of 
carbon dioxide emissions can be considered and the most 
costeffective means of achieving reductions can be seleted 
levin said 
spokesman for general motors ford motor co and chrysler corp 
vowed to contest future efforts to resurrect bryans proposal 
the technology doesnt exist to get us to 40 mpg whether its 
forced on the industry by an amendment or a separate bill 
chrysler spokesman john guiniven said

a group of house staffers spent more than 
28000 going to europe to plan a trip for lawmakers but received 
a jolt just before their return flight the bosses decided to stay 
home 
the decision to scrap the travel after the staffers had gone 
to london paris rome and elsewhere has triggered a dispute 
between the two lawmakers who planned it 
rep frank annunzio dill the chief organizer canceled the 
trip he said he didnt want to use a military plane during the 
us invasion of panama which began while the advance team was in 
europe 
but rep doug barnard jr dga said he suspected his 
colleagues got cold feet because of harsh winter weather in 
europe and bad publicity at home 
according to house records the sixmember advance team spent 
more than 28000 for lodging meals commercial air transportation 
and other expenses between dec 1320 the staffers and members 
contended they learned useful information regardless of the 
cancellation 
the lawmakers were to have traveled in january to gather 
information on europes move toward a unified financial system 
aides to annunzio and barnard also now disagree over whether the 
january itinerary was even set the lawmakers respective advance 
teams scouted different cities 
curtis prins staff director of the annunzioled house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions said the military jet would 
have taken members to strasbourg in france london brussels and 
rome those were the cities visited by annunzios staffer on the 
advance mission subcommittee economist gregory hallisey 
five house government operations subcommittee staffers traveled 
for barnard to paris brussels and madrid one of those staffers 
peter barash said the stops had not been fixed by the members 
barash was staff director of the government operations 
subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs a job he 
left on march 1 barnard is chairman of that panel and also serves 
on annunzios subcommittee a sixth congressional staffer on the 
trip was assigned to barnards committee by congress investigative 
arm the general accounting office 
barnard bristled over annunzios decision to cancel the trip 
maintaining it is vital lawmakers planning to restructure the us 
banking system learn firsthand about europes move toward unified 
financial services by 1992 
barash said he held useful meetings with foreign tax 
authorities us officials involved in tax enforcement 
representatives of the european community and us chamber of 
commerce officials 
weve been doing serious and hard work he said 
annunzio said in an interview that he canceled the trip because 
i could not in good conscience justify using military personnel 
and equipment when the us forces were fighting and dying in 
panama 
he said the military jet transport a version of the commercial 
boeing 707 might have been needed in panama and i wanted to make 
sure it would be available for that purpose 
barnard in a separate interview said i doubt if were that 
limited in military equipment 
he said several members who originally signed up had dropped out 
before the invasion leaving so few lawmakers that use of a 
military plane couldnt be justified anyway 
barnard added he knew of previous trips where at least a 
minority of people got cold feet because of potential adverse 
publicity 
it sounds alluring to go to london paris and madrid but when 
it gets down to going in wintertime its not as appealing and they 
change their minds he said 
barnard said he would like to reschedule the trip for congress 
easter break annunzio noted members will be busy with primary and 
general elections this year but he said he would revive the trip 
if i see interest 
prins staff director of annunzios subcommittee said 19 house 
members were signed up at one point for the january trip and the 
party would have reached 41 including military escorts spouses and 
staff members 
the number of house members had dwindled to 12 just before the 
cancellation prins said but he and annunzio insisted the trip 
would have gone ahead with that number if the invasion had not 
intervened 
prins acknowledged if we had many more defections the trip 
would have been canceled even without the invasion

the us attorneys office has quietly dropped 
charges against a kentucky dentist accused of scheming to kill race 
horses for insurance money prosecutors confirmed thursday 
dr joseph j brown of shelbyville ky was arrested feb 17 
in a calder race course thoroughbred barn on charges of wire fraud 
charges 
a source close to the investigation who spoke to the associated 
press on condition of anonymity said prosecutors agreed to drop 
the charges in exchange for browns cooperation with federal 
investigators in kentucky 
the case evolved after brown allegedly told an undercover agent 
for the thorougbred racing protective board that he would kill 
racehorses for a share of the insurance profits 
the case was dismissed by us magistrate peter palermo on a 
motion by the government us attorneys office spokeswoman 
diane cossin said thursday the charges were dropped march 1 
the case was dismissed without prejudice she said meaning it 
can be filed again at any time 
at the time of his arrest brown 43 had two vials of a clear 
liquid and two syringes hidden in his socks according to an fbi 
affidavit and apparently intended to give a thoroughbred a lethal 
injection miami fbi spokesman paul miller said 
the fbi alleged the dentist said he would charge 15000 to kill 
the horse at calder 2500 down and the rest upon settlement of 
the insurance claim 
the fbi affidavit made references to the related deaths of 
horses in new jersey and new york but the thoroughbred racing 
association in new york found no evidence of suspicious deaths at 
tracks in those states said chris scherf executive vice president 
of the organization

the idaho house voted thursday to repeal the 
states abortion trigger law which sets criminal penalties of 
up to five years in prison both for physicians who perform and 
women who get abortions 
in developments elsewhere cincinnatis archbishop asked 
abortion clinic operators to voluntarily refrain from holy 
communion and planned parenthood said it would appeal a ruling 
upholding the federal governments right to bar family planning aid 
to foreign organizations that perform abortions 
and in alabama a bill that would require preabortion 
counseling and an overnight wait prior to any abortion passed the 
house of representatives 7918 on thursday but the measure faces 
tough electionyear opposition in the state senate 
with little debate idaho house members voted 5428 to erase the 
socalled trigger law which wouldnt take effect unless the us 
supreme court allows states to outlaw abortion 
the repeal measure was forwarded to the state senate where it 
was expected to pass 
i dont think anyone in this house would like the women of 
idaho to be subject to criminal penalties for having an abortion 
said rep gary robbins a democrat who introduced the repeal 
measure i think the women of idaho are able to make their own 
choices and if they do so i dont think they ought to be 
penalized 
the law was adopted by the legislature in 1973 shortly after 
the supreme courts roe vs wade decision essentially legalizing 
abortion on demand through the first two trimesters of pregnancy 
if it were to go into effect the idaho law would mandate prison 
terms of two to five years for physicians who perform abortions and 
one to five years for women undergoing them 
the law couldnt take effect under provisions of roe vs wade 
hence the trigger desingation if the high court were to 
overturn that landmark ruling and allow states to once again ban 
abortion the idaho law would take effect on a proclamation by the 
governor 
in the idaho house debate thursday antiabortion lawmakers 
argued that lifting the threat of criminal penalties ignores the 
rights of the unborn 
some of us are here to speak for those who cant speak for 
themselves do they not count for something asked rep elizabeth 
allanhodge a republican for those of us who believe it is 
murder to kill the unborn we cannot possibly believe we should 
slap them on the hand and tell them its wrong 
in cincinnati archbishop daniel pilarczyk said wednesday that 
roman catholics who operate abortion clinics or promote abortion 
rights shouldnt receive the sacrament of holy communion 
the head of the cincinnati archdiocese stopped short of 
excommunicating or forbidding holy communion to prochoice 
activists 
catholics who obstinately persist in these activities while 
perhaps not formally excommunicated should not consider themselves 
properly disposed to participate in receiving holy communion 
pilarczyk said 
pilarcayks statement was released after a meeting with abortion 
opponents who complained that barbara rinto a catholic who is the 
new director of planned parenthood of cncinnati violates church 
law by operating a clinic that performs abortions 
ms rinto has said that her feelings on abortion are between 
me and my god and that her beliefs about birth control and 
reproduction are private 
in new york planned parenthood announced thursday it would 
appeal a ruling by a federal judge there that upheld a federal 
policy instituted under the reagan administration and continued 
under president bush barring family planning aid to private 
foreign organizations that perform abortions 
the policy adopted by the agency for international development 
1984 requires that foreign private health agencies in return for 
american grants certify that they didnt perform or actively 
promote abortion as a method of family planning 
planned parenthood which assists private foreign agencies had 
charged that the policy was a violation of their first amendment 
right to advocate abortion and interfered with the rights of 
privacy of people seeking family planning information

in effect yeutter has told health and human services secretary

a disabled marine an old womans chauffeur 
a cerebral palsy victim an english teacher and a king of england 
these are the widely divergent characterizations nominated by the 
academy of motion picture arts and sciences for the best 
performance by an actor in 1989 
rarely has the oscar race offered such a range of portrayals 
making perilous any predictions of the winner on march 26 daniel 
daylewis and tom cruise have been termed the favorites but its 
still anybodys guess 
an oscar for cruise would reward a star who is already on top of 
the hollywood heap after four smash hits in a row the color of 
money top gun cocktail and rain man he is the 
actor studios want most 
cruise took a chance with born on the fourth of july 
devoting painful months to portray ron kovic the paraplegic 
vietnam veteran who became an antiwar activist 
tom worked for nothing for 18 months to make this picture 
happen says director oliver stone he came from the same 
background as ron working class catholic upbringing he was 
motivated by the same desires to be the best at what he does to be 
a champion 
in an interview cruise said of his role id like people to 
see that kovic is not simply a victim instead he creates his life 
every day in the face of more difficulty than most of us have 
experienced that was crucial for me to understand that we have to 
fight back when we meet adversity 
christy browns adversity seemed insuperable born into a large 
poor dublin family his cerebral palsy made control of his body 
impossible except for his left foot yet he managed to become an 
acclaimed artist and writer 
daniel daylewis last seen as the libertine surgeon in the 
unbearable lightness of being undertook the punishing role in 
my left foot the son of a onetime poet laureate of england 
and an actress daylewis spent time in a dublin clinic studying 
how children with cerebral palsy coped with their handicaps 
it became very important to me that it didnt become a film 
about a supposedly ablebodied actor taking on the physical 
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man the actor says 
that seemed to me of secondary importance 
morgan freeman who won an academy nomination as supporting 
actor with his vicious pimp in street smart plays a far 
different role in driving miss daisy he is the patient 
understanding chauffeur for a cantankerous southern jewish woman 
jessica tandy freeman who spent his early years in greenwood 
miss had no trouble understanding the role of a black man in the 
postwar south 
having grown up in the south i knew this man he said i 
dont think of him as being subservient you live in a certain 
society and that society has rules and you abide by them you can 
always do that with a certain amount of dignity 
freeman had the advantage of originating the role of hoke in the 
offbroadway version of alfred uhrys play this character was 
totally realized on paper freeman remarks there was little 
for me to do but slip into it and do it 
for kenneth branagh having played henry v in the theater 
was a distinct advantage he was directing as well as starring in 
the film version 
since i had already played the role with the royal shakespeare 
company says the belfastborn branagh it was in the blood 
when i did a take it was like a release all i had to do was be 
the character i could use the medium as spontaneously as if henry 
was a modern figure 
as soon as i finished the take i had to face questions about 
the costumes the lighting and whatever if i had not been familiar 
with the role it would have been terrifying 
dead poets society provided an ideal vehicle for robin 
williams allowing him to use his quicksilver wit within the 
context of a drama he plays john keating a teacher who cajoles 
the students at a 1960s boys school to unshackle their 
imaginations the film was entirely different when presented to 
williams by director peter weir 
the first draft had the whole thing where keating was dying of 
cancer and thats why he was coming back and doing one last good 
deed before he died the actor said in an interview it would 
be real melodramatic that way like love story it was too much 
lets focus on the boys lets make their story stronger and 
weir did just that 
its not about one man against the system its about one 
man coming with some ideas and boys taking them and going off in 
every direction 
williams suggestion cut down his role to what some actors would 
consider a supporting part but the impact of his personality was 
strong enough to prompt academy voters to give him a second 
nomination as best actor his first was for good morning 
vietnam in 1987

khaled mariem came home crying one 
day and said a teacher had lectured about an infidel woman in the 
government who was trying to destroy islam the woman was his 
mother 
mariem bint ahmed aisha who is 35 and does not wear a veil is 
director of the womens affairs department in president maaouyia 
ould sidahmed tayas largely military government 
she got into trouble with fundamentalists by speaking out 
against polygamy mrs mariem says her efforts are not directed 
against islam but at improving the status of women in this 
overwhelmingly moslem nation 
when her 14yearold son described what had happened in school 
she told him your mother is a good moslem she is not what the 
fundamentalist teacher said 
mrs mariem is one of two women in high government positions 
khadjetou bint ahmed is minister of commerce and tourism but she 
became a special target because of her stand on polygamy 
fundamentalists have urged that her husband divorce her for such 
antireligious activities 
in december mrs mariem was a guest on a state radio program 
she explained to an interviewer in her office and the subject of 
the debate was the emancipation of women 
i expressed my point of view on certain issues among which 
was polygamy which is for me a very retrograde practice that 
doesnt reflect our modern age she said 
polygamy is a sensitive issue in mauritania a largely desert 
land in north africa 
aissata kan who in the 1970s became the first woman cabinet 
member worked hard as minister of social affairs for a law 
prohibiting polygamy 
she succeeded in getting it passed but her husband left her the 
night of its approval and returned a few days later with a second 
wife the law against polygamy was repealed later 
of the angry reaction by fundamentalists to her own stand 
against polygamy mrs mariem said to say that polygamy has no 
place in our era was for them the same as saying that islam is 
not good for every time and place 
the storm surrounding mrs mariem put the government in the 
difficult position of trying to safeguard her without offending the 
fundamentalists 
as she explained it the teacher at her sons school had spoken 
of an infidel woman protected by the government who is using the 
official media to destroy islam 
official media particularly television were ordered not to 
cover her activities she already had caused a stir in islamic 
circles by appearing on television in her nontraditional clothing 
in mosques public meetings and speeches the campaign against 
her grew 
i was really terrified she said i became a devil for our 
conservative society my husband who is a religious man was told 
to divorce me because a moslem is not permitted to be married to an 
apostate 
her main opponent has been sheik mohamed ould sidi yahya a 
cleric with a wide following his speeches have been played over 
loudspeakers all over the country 
they are heard on buses and even in taxis often whether the 
passenger wants to hear them or not 
yahya made two tapes attacking mrs mariem the government 
finally ordered their confiscation and the withdrawal of all 
recorded speeches by fundamentalists 
they are good proof against him she said of the tapes i 
was prepared to prosecute him but could not because of pressure 
from his tribe and from different personalities sent as mediators 
the most important thing is that i deprived them of a good 
means of propaganda 
mrs mariems department has been attached directly to the 
secretariat of the ruling military committee she described that as 
a government gesture to strengthen her position 
she said her fight in a country where the segregation of women 
is still the rule will not be finished until mauritanian women 
achieve their rights 
the situation of mauritanian women is not what it should 
be mrs mariem said we are still considered a beautiful 
creation whose only task is to please men

when two actors in the same movie are 
nominated for academy awards the common belief is that they will 
cancel each other out 
but it doesnt always happen sometimes one wins 
f murray abraham won as best actor for amadeus in 1984

in recent years there have been other winners and losers for

the phenomenon will be tested again this year lena olin and 
anjelica huston are both nominated for supporting actress for their 
roles in enemies a love story 
the two actresses offer an interesting contrast one a member of 
an american acting dynasty the other a product of the european 
theater huston made history in 1986 when she became a 
thirdgeneration oscar winner as supporting actress in prizzis 
honor she had been directed by her father john huston himself 
an academy award winner as writerdirector of the treasure of the 
sierra madre in 1948 his father walter was named best 
supporting actor for the same film 
in enemies a love story huston plays an auschwitz survivor

described her character as magnificent extremely intelligent and 
honest compassionate and yet not selfsacrificing i loved being 
able to make that statement 
shes after the truth all the time she cant compromise and 
thats what i like about her comments lena olin about her role 
she is another of the three wives of silver in the paul mazursky 
film 
olin was born in stockholm and became a protegee of ingmar 
bergman for whom she acted in after the rehearsal and fanny

brenda fricker only found out about her oscar 
nomination because she happened to be visiting her 80yearold 
father the day the 62nd annual academy award nominations were 
announced 
thats because fricker doesnt have a telephone at her holiday 
cottage in dublin and would like to keep it that way 
nothing will equal the excitement of that moment fricker 
45 said of her reaction at hearing she was up against anjelica 
huston lena olin julia roberts and dianne wiest for this years 
supporting actress oscar 
fricker was nominated for my left foot a lowbudget film 
about irish writer christy brown severely crippled by cerebral 
palsy who found renown through painting and writing with his left 
foot 
the film has received an unexpected five nominations including 
best film and best director as well as leading actor daniel 
daylewis as christy and fricker as his fiercely loyal and loving 
mother 
why has my left foot done so well in the oscar race when 
other independent films such as sex lies and videotape and 
do the right thing were more or less ignored 
maybe its because its a true story and its totally 
unsentimental fricker mused 
certainly few scenes in 1989 could match the flinty mothers 
softly spoken remark to her tormented son sometimes i think you 
are my heart 
in a recent interview fricker talked about the danger of 
milking such a part for cheap emotions 
there were places where it was quite tempting and jim 
director jim sheridan was in there the whole time saying dont 
do that and he was absolutely right she said 
i was resisting it myself and i kept saying to jim if you 
see one hint of it in my voice or face pull me up immediately 
she had thought her performance was not the sort to win prizes 
the style of acting i do is extreme underacting she said 
its insulting to the audience if you overstate everything when 
im a member of the audience i love guessing what actors are 
thinking on screen 
a lengthy stage career has included stints at the abbey in 
dublin and at the royal shakespeare company and national theater in 
london she has been a series regular for five seasons on 
casualty an english medical drama shot in bristol west of 
london where she lives 
while she doesnt think she will win the oscar she knows whom 
she is rooting for anjelica huston for paul mazurskys enemies 
a love story 
i really think she should get it fricker said shes so 
versatile if you think of prizzis honor and the dead shes a 
very talented lady

antonin scalia often seems impatient with the 
pace of change on an increasingly conservative supreme court but 
time could be on his side the comparatively youthful justice may 
be using his keen intellect and missionary zeal well into the 21st 
century to pull the court farther to the right 
the prospect delights conservatives and alarms liberals 
his supporters call him a man of principle unwilling to accept 
halfmeasures detractors say he is an extremist bent on undoing 
key liberal precedents 
both sides agree that scalia who turned 54 sunday and is 30 
years younger than the courts oldest member is assuming the role 
of conservative point man played by william h rehnquist before he 
became chief justice 
there is no question that since rehnquist has become chief 
justice he has seen his role as less of an advocate than a 
consensusbuilder a vacuum was created and scalia filled that 
void said rich samp of the conservative washington legal 
foundation 
scalias confrontational style was on display last year when 
justice sandra day oconnor stopped short of voting to overturn the 
courts 1973 ruling in roe vs wade that created a constitutional 
right to an abortion 
calling oconnors position irrational a frustrated scalia 
said we can now look forward to at least another term with carts 
full of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators 
american university law professor herman schwartz said scalia 
an ardent foe of judicially created rights was showing his pique 
i think he was angry and i think he feels oconnor may have 
betrayed the cause and hes a man who believes in causes 
schwartz said 
judge abner mikva a former colleague on the federal appeals 
court here on which scalia served before former president reagan 
named him to the high court in 1986 has described scalia as warm 
and engaging and unyielding in fighting for what he believes 
he understands the doctrine of collegiality and has in fact 
found middle ground mikva said but once scalia has made up his 
mind theres no shaking him loose 
scalia sticking to his general policy declined to be 
interviewed for this article 
gregarious and quickwitted he normally revels in being the 
center of attention before a reception held for him by reporters 
when he joined the high court he said i can have more fun if 
its off the record 
assured he would not be quoted for publication he engaged in a 
lively dialogue for hours as reporters peppered him with questions 
on another occasion scalia was asked why he was wearing a 
tuxedo to an informal evening gettogether at the court 
he was headed for another party scalia said adding esteemed 
jurist by day manabouttown by night 
the same playfulness is apparent at the courts argument 
sessions the justices only regularly scheduled public appearances 
scalia is among the courts most forceful persistent and 
frequent interrogators of the lawyers who argue before the court 
using the attorneys as foils he often appears to be trying to 
persuade other justices to see his views 
sometimes the tactic backfires 
justice harry a blackmun said after the courts 198788 term 
that scalia asks far too many questions he takes over the case 
from counsel 
rehnquist once indirectly scolded scalia from the bench after 
the junior justice persisted in quizzing a lawyer about a 
procedural matter 
i hope when youre given an opportunity to do so youll 
address some of your remarks to the question on which the court 
voted to grant review rehnquist told the attorney 
scalias critics worry that he has an agenda for overruling past 
decisions particularly ones that expanded civil rights and 
individual liberties 
it is as though he made a list of all the things he didnt 
like that the court has done in the last 50 years said american 
universitys schwartz essentially he sees himself as the agent 
of major change to root out these constitutional errors in many 
ways hes the most radical member of the court 
but alan slobodin of the washington legal foundation said 
scalias only agenda is adhering to the original intent of the 
framers of the constitution and reducing judicial intervention in 
decisionmaking by the executive and legislative branches 
i might call him the originalist conscience of the court 
slobodin said hes less interested in votecounting than in 
forcing the justices to confront first principles hes trying to 
make the court more accountable more principled 
scalia the courts first italianamerican and father of nine 
children has a strong academic background he is the only son of 
an italian immigrant father who was a professor at brooklyn college 
and a mother who taught elementary school 
scalia graduated first in his class from georgetown university 
and won high honors with his harvard university law degree he 
taught law for 10 years 
the impact of his brilliance on the supreme court remains 
uncertain 
university of chicago law school dean geoffrey stone who 
admires scalias boldness said the thing to keep in mind about 
scalia is he does have very strong intellectual skills that will 
lead him to be out in front the real question is will there be 
anyone behind him

a rude slab of granite 
inscribed with a celtic cross and the name patric proclaims the 
grave of irelands patron saint 
the stone rough and broken looks as old as ireland itself but 
the marker was placed outside the anglican cathedral around 1900 
i dont feel people should be let down by that said brian 
turner curator of the down county museum nearby you need a 
focus of attention 
it is quite likely that the man who was st patrick is buried 
somewhere around here 
canon brian mayne a prebendary of the cathedral of the holy and 
undivided trinity said he was 999 percent certain patrick was 
buried somewhere on the hilltop which attracted 20000 visitors 
last year 
turner called it 95 percent likely that he is buried in down 
or in saul two miles away he is assured by a tradition that can 
be traced to the 7th century although even that remote date is two 
centuries after patricks death 
the hills around downpatrick are dotted with sites related to 
patrick in very iffy ways legend say patrick landed at saul and 
432 came to be the accepted date 
another legend claims he received last rites from st tassach 
who is associated with a ruined church at raholp near saul 
a few miles south at struell wells more ruins mark the pools 
where patrick is supposed to have immersed himself all night 
singing psalms 
patrick stories are found all over ireland the roman catholic 
and anglican primates have their seats in armagh because it is 
said patrick chose the place 
thousands of pilgrims fast and pray in the summer on a little 
island in lough derg county donegal where as the story goes 
patrick wrestled with demons many more climb croagh patrick in 
western ireland retracing a saintly journey 
based on patricks own writings not one place in ireland can 
definitely be associated with him all he says about himself is 
that he was born in britain was taken captive in ireland escaped 
and later returned as a missionary 
patrick probably lived in the 5th century the traditional dates 
are 432 for the beginning of his mission and 461 for his death 
the first lives of patrick were written in the 7th century and 
collected in 807 in the book of armagh now a treasure of trinity 
college dublin 
the book of armagh says patricks grave was chosen by two oxen 
that were allowed to wander where they would pulling a cart 
bearing the body 
its a good story and so is one turner found which was written 
down in the 19th century 
sometime in the 1700s it seems a barber played a prank on the 
cathedrals sexton by leaving him halfshaved the humorless sexton 
vowed that the barber never would rest in his family gravesite 
the sexton had an old cross erected over the barbers family 
plot then spread the word that it marked the grave of st patrick 
pilgrims came flocking and further burials were impossible 
you know the irish always have to make a good story better 
said canon joseph maguire at the roman catholic cathedral

for years each school day lorraine begay was 
flung from side to side as the van from the local high school 
bumped over the 10 miles of rutted dirt roads leading to her navajo 
reservation home 
the girl crippled by severe arthritis wanted to attend a 
nearby federal bureau of indian affairs boarding school but the 
bureau would not install the wheelchair ramp and special toilet she 
needed 
ms begay still is being bounced around this time in federal 
court where she filed suit for unspecified damages after 
experiencing what one judge called bureaucracy at its worst 
because ms begay cannot sue the federal government directly 
she has sued individual bia employees ranging from an agency 
superintendent to a head custodian who face financial ruin if she 
wins their lawyers say 
both sides are hoping the federal government will reimburse the 
employees if ms begay wins a judgment but the government has 
refused any payments so far though it likely will spend more on 
attorneys fees than it would have cost to settle out of court 
in addition to the lawyers fees the government could be forced 
to reimburse the employees for whatever ms begay wins at trial 
us district judge carl muecke said in a january ruling that an 
assistant us attorney who represented them early in the 
litigation may have botched the case so badly that they will be 
able to sue the government for damages 
no trial date has been set and the case has dragged on for 
years despite general agreement that ms begay suffered 
unneccessarily 
the modifications the school needed to accommodate her 
wheelchair would have cost no more than a few thousand dollars at 
most according to court records and were supposed to have been 
made under a federal law mandating access for the handicapped 
school officials give conflicting reasons as to why the work 
wasnt done 
no records are available detailing how much the lawsuit has cost 
the government but one defense attorney estimates the legal bill 
for the four private lawyers alone already has reached 80000 and 
could double or triple if the case goes to trial 
ms begay now 23 graduated from high school two years late 
largely because of paininduced absences she still lives at home 
with no electricity or running water in the tiny community of many 
farms deep inside the sprawling navajo reservation 
arthritis has confined her to a wheelchair since age 13 and she 
often doesnt even have the muscle strength to sit up 
her mind is wasting away and thats all she has because her 
body obviously doesnt do much for her said pamela liberty who 
took on ms begays case while a legal aid attorney and stuck with 
it after moving to private practice 
were not trying to make this into a milliondollar lawsuit 
ms liberty said we want what it would take to get her through 
college 
ms begays problems began in 1980 but she tried to resolve 
them with school officials and did not file suit until july 1985 
she was offered placement in a distant school for the 
handicapped but chose to stay with her family and commute to the 
high school while waiting for the local boarding school to install 
the ramp and toilet 
as late as may 21 1985 she still hoped for an outofcourt 
resolution 
i am writing to you to see if you can help me go to school at 
many farms boarding high school she said in a handwritten letter 
to sen dennis deconcini dariz 
they say there is no ramp for my wheel chair she wrote 
they have told me they would fix the school up so i could go 
there but they never have 
i cry a lot because of pains from traveling the reservation 
roads thats why i want to go to a boarding school i do not want 
to go to a handicap school i am a regular child and want to be in 
school with all my brothers and sisters 
government officials made an offer 25000 according to 
sources relatively early in the case but ms begays lawyers 
wanted 100000 figuring thats what it would take to finance four 
years at a good outofstate college 
ms begays acceptable minimum has been rising as the legal 
maneuvers by defense attorneys continue ms libertys former boss 
at southern arizona legal aid bill morris now figures the minimum 
at 250000 
the judge has scoffed at defense claims that ms begay is to 
blame because she did not fill out applications after being told 
the school couldnt admit her 
the school telling her to forget it was like having somebody 
stand at the door with a gun muecke said 
of defense attorneys claims that only toplevel officials in 
washington are at fault the judge said i find that rather 
astonishing i find that bureaucracy at its worst 
i dont think any of the defendants have done anything 
wrong said dan rosenfelt an albuquerque nm lawyer who 
represents some of the employees including a school principal who 
says he never talked to ms begay and didnt even know about the 
problem 
its not clear that the government did anything wrong 
rosenfelt said this is not a case in my opinion where justice 
cries out for a settlement

in 1954 volker schlondorff was a 15yearold 
living in wiesbaden west germany when he saw elia kazans film 
classic on the waterfront after the movie was over he walked 
out of the theater and kept walking for hours 
schlondorff couldnt stop thinking about how effective movies 
were at showing injustice in the world how well he related to 
marlon brandos fight against corrupt union officials how film 
seemed larger than life yet completely believeable 
the same week schlondorff saw alfred hitchcocks thriller 
rear window and took another walk this time he thought of 
suspense watching and being watched of james stewart unable to 
move out of his wheelchair because of a broken leg making up 
stories about the neighbors on whom he spied 
idealism and voyeurism have been a major part of the directors 
own work never more effectively than in the 1979 film the tin 
drum schlondorffs acclaimed adaptation of gunter grass novel 
about nazi germany as seen through a young boys eyes 
so schlondorff had no difficulty agreeing to direct the movie 
version of margaret atwoods bestselling the handmaids tale 
in which a young woman natasha richardson in the movie observes 
and eventually escapes the horrors of gilead a society ruled 
by rightwing fundamentalists 
while we were doing it we were strongly reminded of the tin 
drum schlondorff said in a recent interview 
the main character of natasha richardson and the way she goes 
through life first trying to understand before even reacting the 
socalled passive character as if to watch and to think wasnt an 
activity is very similar to tin drum where hes mostly the 
witness of whats happening to others and whats happening to 
himself 
in gilead women live in a strict caste system their rank 
indicated by the color of their clothes richardson dressed in 
red is a handmaid her sole function to conceive children robert 
duvall is the commander whose child richardson is to bear faye 
dunaway is his wife and aidan quinn is the commanders chauffeur 
with whom richardson falls in love 
schlondorff viewed the characters as archetypes representing 
different aspects of society the patriarch the matriarch etc 
and thought the story had an epic structure in line with the 
operas he loves to produce 
the whole idea that every character has his aria then from 
time to time theres an ensemble piece and its important to have 
changes of pace you can not be fast all the time he said 
there is also the idea of a crescendo and a high point i like 
to work on screenplays some times in terms of music thinking of 
music and to get the musicians involved in it 
schlondorff emerged in the mid1960s as part of the junger 
deutscher film movement young german film movement which 
included rainer werner fassbinder werner herzog and wim wenders 
his first feature film young torless came out in 1966 and 
shared the international critics prize at cannes he has since 
directed the lost honor of katharina blum and coup de 
grace among others and also directed the american television 
adaptation of death of a salesman which starred dustin hoffman 
schlondorff begins his 1981 film circle of deceit with an 
explanation to the audience that the film about the civil war in 
lebanon is just a work of the imagination only fictional though 
the scenes were shot on location 
the handmaids tale is also a work of the imagination of 
course but schlondorff had little trouble finding a realistic 
setting for a society that supposedly doesnt exist 
we said what would an american dictatorship be like first 
of all it would be run by advertising people who would try to make 
the most gruesome things look comfortable 
this future society would be a cheap society a k mart 
society you wind up with a world of supermarkets and shopping 
malls and then you go to north carolina and you say well its 
all there so we gave up all this big elaboration and said 
lets just shoot the existing world and say its our future 
schlondorff considers each of his films a personal creation no 
matter who first developed the story noting that atwood began the 
book in berlin the director adds his own touch including a 
reconstruction of the berlin wall in the opening scene 
i think culture has to do not with reinventing from scratch 
all the time but with reflections and variations on things other 
people did before we are just in a chain of people working again 
and again with the same material it may seem minor to some people 
but its major enough for me

if any phrase could sum up the career of richard 
rodgers it is a lyric from no strings the only musical for 
which he wrote both words and music 
the sweetest sounds ill ever hear are still inside my head 
sing its lead characters played originally on broadway by diahann 
carroll and richard kiley that search for the perfect melody 
echoed throughout rodgers career of more than 60 years in the 
american musical theater years that were divided into three 
distinctive parts 
the composers career first with lorenz hart then with oscar 
hammerstein ii and finally with a variety of younger lyricists is 
celebrated in music by richard rodgers to be shown friday 
march 16 on pbs great performances 
the show narrated by shirley jones is studded with film clips 
from many rodgers shows as different as the garrick gaities 
pal joey and the sound of music 
and there is an appreciation of rodgers who died in 1979 by 
other composers including andrew lloyd webber burton lane jerry 
herman and charles strouse as well as remembrances by his widow 
dorothy rodgers 
he really was a theater writer she said the other day in an 
interview at her fifth avenue apartment unlike some other great 
writers irving berlin for instance who was the greatest 
songwriter who ever lived dick wrote only for the theater or film 
or television 
rodgers gave the impression of being a fast writer able to dash 
off music quickly that wasnt so mrs rodgers insists before he 
began composing he would carefully consider what he wanted to 
express the emotion he was trying to convey and what he wanted to 
say to advance the plot he also considered practical matters such 
as the musical ability of his stars 
just before he died he wrote i remember mama for liv 
ullmann who had a range of very few notes mrs rodgers said 
it was quite a difficult thing to do but he accepted all such 
challenges 
rodgers always looked for something new to do 
he felt the greatest way to insure failure was to repeat 
yourself mrs rodgers said 
his quest for innovation led to four of his best musicals with 
hart written after an unsatisfying sojourn to hollywood in the 
early 1930s these landmarks were on your toes 1936 with its 
use of extended ballet sequences created by george balanchine 
babes in arms 1937 which starred one of the youngest group of 
performers ever to appear on broadway the boys from syracuse 
1938 one of the most successful musical adaptations of a 
shakespeare comedy and pal joey 1940 a sophisticated 
sardonic show with gene kelly as its charming antihero 
rodgers always wrote at home he didnt have an office until 
after carousel in 1945 when he and hammerstein started to 
produce shows themselves 
larry hart and oscar hammerstein worked in totally different 
ways mrs rodgers recalled larry could not be forced to put a 
word on paper until he heard the tune but oscar wanted the freedom 
to write the lyric first dick didnt care he could work either 
way 
sometimes he would close open doors because he preferred not 
to feel that people were listening until he finished writing we 
all entered into a conspiracy of pretending that we couldnt hear 
him until he was done and he went along with that he allowed 
himself to be fooled 
if there was any question about a tune rodgers simply threw it 
away and wrote another one mrs rodgers said although hart and 
hammerstein mostly used what their partner wrote 
once in a while my daughters and i wouldnt let him forget 
something we were crazy about that got lost in the tryout period 
she said one example is getting to know you which was called 
suddenly lucky when it was in south pacific and then dropped 
theres a small hotel was written for jumbo and producer billy 
rose didnt like it so it was taken out later dick used it in on 
your toes but it was rare that he used a song again he felt that 
he could always do better writing a new song for a new situation 
the rodgers and hart partnership ended in 1943 with harts death 
at the age of 48 of acute pneumonia complicated by alcoholism 
larry was brilliant but he was basically a very unhappy man 
mrs rodgers said and if you read his lyrics that sadness is 
there 
even before harts death rodgers had begun work on a new 
project which hart turned down to adapt green grow the 
lilacs into a musical play his partner was hammerstein and the 
show became oklahoma 
oscar was a very methodical man if he said he would finish 
the lyric in a week it would be finished in a week mrs rodgers 
said once dick and oscar decided on the musical they would do 
they spent endless hours discussing every aspect of what kind of 
show it would be 
after oklahoma the rodgers and hammerstein partnership 
lasted 17 years and out of it came such classics as carousel 
the king and i and the sound of music 
hammerstein died in 1960 of cancer and rodgers plunged on alone 
with no strings besides writing both music and lyrics he did 
several interesting things with the show he put the orchestra on 
stage with the actors and took the shows title literally there 
were no stringed instruments in the show 
even though rodgers last shows two by two rex and i 
remember mama were unsuccessful they contained soaring melodies 
such songs as i do not know a day i did not love you away 
from you and you could not please me more are among his most 
haunting 
but even the master had selfdoubts about his work 
oh yes his wife said at least until he began to work on 
the next show once he got the first song out which he called the 
first olive out of the jar then he relaxed and felt confident

the turbulent events of bostons school 
busing years are told in the twopart cbs miniseries common 
ground through three families whose lives cross only at the 
schools 
common ground based on the pulitzer prizewinning book by 
j anthony lukas will be broadcast sunday and tuesday essentially 
telling three separate stories of how each family is affected by 
the busing of the 1960s and 70s the children occasionally pass 
each other on the common ground of the schools 
heading one family is rachel twymon a black divorced woman with 
six children 
basically all she was after was the best education she could 
get for her children said cch pounder who plays mrs twymon 
she wasnt a spokesperson she wasnt a radical at that time 
she wasnt a member of any organization she was on welfare 
jane curtin plays alice mcgoff a widow dismayed that her seven 
children might not be allowed to attend neighborhood schools she 
joins an antibusing group eventually called powder keg 
richard thomas is colin diver an idealistic young lawyer whose 
liberal attitudes and hopes for a racially mixed society are 
challenged by reality 
the three performers never met in production because their 
stories were filmed at different times 
rachel was a very strong woman extremely forceful said 
pounder i think she ruled and not necessarily with a velvet 
glove as she tried to keep her children straight she was 
definitely the strong arm but her daughters rebelled she had a 
stricter standard for her daughters the boys got to do what they 
wanted 
the miniseries written by edward hume and directed by michael 
newell was filmed on location in toronto canada because it was 
felt the wounds had not yet healed in boston the mcgoffs and 
twymons visited the sets during filming mrs twymon died in 
january 
pounder who was born in guyana and raised mostly in england 
worked closely with a voice coach to learn the colloquial boston 
black accent 
my mother had wanted me to become a newscaster so i wouldnt 
lose my british accent she said i now reserve my british 
accent exclusively for my family 
whenever im working and doing another accent i avoid calling 
my family its hard to switch it on and off you have to be 
afflicted with a parrot tongue as my mother says 
pounder called the miniseries more than just a story of the 
busing issue 
to say that common ground is about busing in boston is to 
say that moby dick is about whaling she said lukas went off 
to document each family he got a story thats really more about 
boston itself 
pounder whose full name is carol christine hilaria pounder 
attended a roman catholic boarding school in england she went to 
college in this country when her mother who had worked at the us 
embassy in london took a job with a new york newspaper 
i started acting at the age of 9 in england she said i 
played a lot of pages i dont think i played a girl until i was 
20 it took me the longest time to say out loud that i was an 
actress it seemed to be closely linked to the oldest profession 
when i began people were skeptical and would ask oh yeah what 
have you done 
shes done plenty shes probably best known for her starring 
role in the movie bagdad cafe and a featured role in prizzis 
honor 
shes starred in two other miniseries if tomorrow comes and 
the atlanta child murders and such tv movies as murder in 
mississippi and no place like home she was a regular on the 
comedy series women in prison and has been a guest on la 
law and hill street blues 
pounder was asked to reprise her role as brenda in the cbs 
series based on bagdad cafe but declined whoopi goldberg 
plays the role in the series 
i may do another series but i felt i had done bagdad 
cafe she said if i had done it i would have done it just 
for the money brendas walking a very thin line on being just your 
basic handsonloudmouth it could become shallow in a series if 
you dont have good writing

timbuktu was lucky last year it rained 
the locusts stayed away and with some help from the outside 
farmers produced one of the best harvests in half a century 
farmers in nearly all the countries that hug the southern sahara 
deserts harsh border produced similar bumper crops that filled 
graneries and childrens bellies from senegal east to niger 
the good fortune of 1988 and 1989 welcome as it is also 
illuminates the profound problems facing these poor nations 
struggling to feed themselves problems that range from a 
birthrate that outpaces production to a marketplace that stacks the 
deck against even the hardestworking farmer 
experts note that even with the bountiful harvest in most 
countries subsaharan africa imported nearly 9 million tons of 
cereal grains in 1988 
nonetheless the 500000ton grain surplus is spectacular 
news said us ambassador robert pringle now everyone is 
wondering how to export what they have grown 
abduleh al kalifa hipdeep in a field of emeraldgreen wheat 
rippling in a desert wind near timbuktu doesnt worry about 
exporting he just wishes he could sell his surplus 30 miles away 
in timbuktu 
five years ago there was no rain nothing to eat said 
kalifa 36 already middleaged in a nation where the average life 
expectancy is 49 foreigners gave us everything these last two 
years the harvests were good we have hope and two warehouses are 
full 
we have more than we can eat more than we can store and we 
cant sell the rest he said how can we get our grain to town 
if there are no roads how can we compete with grain from other 
countries how can we earn enough money to buy food when there is 
another drought 
malis last drought left its mark on the children twoyearolds 
are solid and round but children born in the drought of 19841985 
are spindly apt to suffer from chronic malnutrition 
if you are malnourished a few good meals will make you feel 
better but you are still malnourished said leo devos director 
of the united nations childrens fund in mali the whole country 
is like these children it will take more than a couple of good 
harvests to put the country back on its feet 
still its nice to see the green he said it is the 
color of hope 
when unicef arrived five years ago with emergency food the 
government was in chaos people were starving and huge numbers of 
refugees arrived in cities each day from the barren countryside 
enormous need remained when the crisis ended so unicef and 
others stayed on to help 
the united states which spends about 30 million a year in 
mali now helps entrepreneurs and small farmers west germany built 
warehouses for reserves and a highway that spans a nation as large 
as texas and california combined 
france italy and others fight the advance of the desert dig 
wells organize cooperatives and help in dozens of other ways 
unicef has concentrated on timbuktu a oncemysterious oasis 
that still evokes romance and adventure 
centuries ago timbuktu was a crossroads of caravans a center 
of learning and a garden in the desert where the river ran deep 
and trees hung heavy with fruit 
now the advancing desert has tied a noose of dunes around it 
and many donors have written the city off as a lost cause 
with funds donated by italian labor unions unicef installed 
pumps to make use of niger river water and drilled wells to tap 
ground water for irrigation 
we wanted to set an example to show what could be done in 
even the most precarious situation devos said one result of the 
fiveyear project was the field where kalifa and his neighbors grew 
a 15ton grain surplus little of which can be sold 
the malian government used to have price controls which kept 
food costs down and made urban voters happy but discouraged 
farmers because of the low return on their labor controls were 
abolished at the insistence of the world bank and international 
monetary fund 
international donors and lenders also demanded that mali 
eliminate protectionist measures and subsidies to farmers their 
message was simple no open markets no aid 
we have a longterm commitment to food aid in return for 
which we ask that the entire cereal market be freed said dennis 
brennan director of the us agency for international development

costs less in the timbuktu bazaar than grain grown down the road 
the little guy works like crazy to grow something pulling 
grain from soil that is poor in primitive conditions and in a 
climate that is never favorable even when there is no drought 
said giovanni fiore director of unicefs timbuktu project and an 
africa veteran 
then when the farmer produces a surplus there are no buyers 
no one in the villages has any cash and consumers in timbuktu buy 
whatever is cheapest 
it comes from europe or the united states where farmers 
receive subsidies fiore said how can a malian compete he has 
no subsidy all he has is taxes and the high cost of the pump 
gasoline oil fertilizer all of which has to be imported at 
double triple 10 times the cost to an american 
meanwhile the donors tie aid to an open market in which 
farmers from developed countries can sell their surplus so our 
farmers eat what they can store a little which will last a year 
or two and when there is another extended drought there will be 
famine

specialty apparel stores appear poised to outrun their mass 
merchandising competitors again this year retail analysts say 
results reported thursday by several nationwide retailers 
indicated womens mens and childrens clothing sold faster in 
february than other goods continuing a yearlong trend 
kurt barnard a new yorkbased consultant said the february 
reports show that the american public is willing to buy provided 
theyre given an incentive in terms of moderate prices and exciting 
merchandise displayed in a very exciting ambience 
although february tends to be one of the slowest times for 
shopping analysts said the retailing results for last month looked 
promising and were better than expected given current weakness in 
the economy 
certainly retailing is not dead said karen sack an analyst 
at standard amp poors corp in new york 
linda r morris of pnc financial corp in philadelphia said the 
february figures signal that the consumer is continuing to spend 
although its not a robust retail environment it certainly bodes 
well for a decent year 
among the retailers reporting thursday were department store 
groups specialty clothing chains discounters and mass 
merchandisers 
other national chains posted their february results a week ago 
including the nations largest general merchandiser sears roebuck 
and co discounter walmart stores inc department store operator 
jc penney co inc and others variations in fiscalyear 
calendars have caused retailers to have differing sales reporting 
schedules 
last weeks reports with the exception of the ones from sears 
and montgomery ward amp co showed solid sales increases 
thomas tashjian an analyst at seidler amdec securities inc in 
los angeles noted that this years results from the later 
reporting retailers werent exactly comparable with last years 
their 1990 periods ended one week later closer to spring so 
they benefited more from a seasonal pickup in shopping 
retailers specializing in apparel fared the best in times of 
sluggish economic growth purchases of expensive items such as 
furniture and home appliances are typically the first things to go 
tashjian said apparel shoppers responded favorably to bold 
prints chineselook florals short skirts for juniors and denim 
sportswear especially in white stores in malls had heavier 
traffic than ones located elsewhere 
the limited inc the largest specialty apparel retailer in the 
country reported a 21 percent gain in total sales for the four 
weeks ended march 3 while sales at stores open a year or longer 
were up 16 percent 
results at stores open at least a year called samestore or 
comparablestores sales are considered the best reflection of a 
retailers performance based in columbus ohio the limited 
operates its flagship stores plus victorias secret abercrombie amp 
fitch lane bryant and others 
san franciscobased gap inc another apparel retailer said its 
sales surged 29 percent while its samestore sales gained 20 
percent 
meanwhile may department stores co based in st louis said 
sales went up 106 percent and 77 percent on a comparablestore 
basis one of mays best known department store chains is lord amp 
taylor 
dayton hudson corp a minneapolisbased owner of department 
stores and the target discount chain said sales growth at all 
three of its operating units surpassed projected levels total 
sales rose 131 percent and sales at stores open at least a year 
increased 63 percent 
chairman and chief executive officer kenneth a macke said 
these increases are strong against a solid february last year 
mass merchandiser k mart corps overall results also benefited 
from good gains in womens mens and childrens clothing lines 
k mart based in troy mich said its sales for the four weeks 
ended feb 28 grew 147 percent and samestore sales were up 44 
percent the retailer second in 1989 sales volume behind sears 
also owns the waldenbooks bookstore chain pay less drug stores and 
other chains 
strong gains were seen in ladies mens and childrens 
apparel lines as good initial customer response to our early spring 
merchandise contributed to the excellent sales in these 
classifications said joseph e antonini chairman and chief 
executive officer 
k mart recently said it is speeding up plans to open additional 
stores and refurbish others as it attempts to capitalize on the 
weakness at sears and to stay ahead of fastgrowing rival walmart 
walmart is widely considered a powerful contender for the no 1 
ranking in terms of annual merchandise sales revenue in the united 
states currently it is no 3 but it is growing at a much faster 
clip than sears or k mart

debt experts testifying about junk bonds 
before a house panel looked at their tea leaves and said things 
will get better unless they get worse 
they also suggested congress shouldnt try to restrict junk 
bonds even though they predicted more companies are likely to 
default on their obligations 
representatives from the venerable bond rating agencies moodys 
investors service and standard amp poors corp were among the 
witnesses testifying thursday before a subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee 
while the credithappy 1980s saw corporations leverage their 
operations heavily by taking on ever more debt deleveraging is 
the future trend of the early 1990s said mark bachman senior 
vice president of sampps corporate finance department 
unfortunately there are reasons to be concerned that the 
process of deleveraging may not proceed smoothly he added the 
main reason the economy 
while a mild recession would not necessarily pose major 
problems a severe one could said bachman 
an sampp publication released earlier this week said us 
companies defaulted on 6 billion of publicly issued debt last 
year up from 44 billion in 1988 annual defaults could 
approach 15 billion in a difficult economic environment it 
predicted 
the congressional testimony provided a shortcourse in corporate 
finance especially concerning the highyield highrisk bonds 
dubbed junk 
a junk bond is a shaky debt it is the promise to pay of a 
debtor who is just getting by said james grant editor of 
grants interest rate observer 
most bonds are in effect corporate ious promising to pay back 
borrowed money at a later date while paying a regular fixed 
interest 
junk bonds however are considered by agencies like sampp and 
moodys to be speculative carrying a significant risk of default 
to compensate for the greater risk they pay a much higher rate of 
interest than more stable bonds 
proponents of junk bonds says that the high yields more than 
compensate for the risk of default if your portfolio is 
diversified 
pioneered by financier michael milken at nowdefunct drexel 
burnham lambert inc junk bonds helped small or fledgling 
companies expand and also assisted corporate raiders take over huge 
corporations with little or no cash 
but the 200 billion junk bond market has been rocked repeatedly 
in recent months by milkens indictment on racketeering charges 
corporate defaults the withdrawal of many savings and loan 
institutions as buyers and the bankruptcy filing by drexels parent 
company 
thomas j mcguire director of moodys corporate department 
said the default rate for junk bonds has risen to 54 percent 
the secondhighest rate since 1970 and the outlook given the 
increase in lower rated issuers and the potentially unfavorable 
economic environment is for still higher levels of defaults in 
the early 1990s 
a jittery market and the selfdestruction of drexel burnham 
lambert group have raised new questions about the role of junk 
bonds in our economy said rep edward markey dmass chairman 
of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
is there anything for congress to do about this markey 
asked 
not necessarily economists said 
legislation is more likely to worsen than help the problem 
said david a wyss chief financial economist for drimcgrawhill 
leverage is a response to the incentives in the tax law and 
unless those incentives change attacking the symptoms will just 
cause problems elsewhere he said 
moreover wyss said if investors can hold on to the bonds for 
an extended period riding through the current storm we believe 
their patience will be rewarded 
the junk bond problem is really a junk credit problem said 
grant a prominent critic of the growth of debt in recent years 
in the 1980s we had an explosion of the credit supply 
with the junk market battered by the developments of recent 
months i would advise the subcommittee to be wary of pushing the 
market toward even greater stringency grant said

government plans to increase taxes and 
regulation on futures trading are death threats that could 
imperil the industry the head of the worlds biggest futures 
exchange says 
in a speech thursday to the annual meeting of the futures 
industry association chicago board of trade chairman karsten 
mahlmann said americas share of worldwide futures trading volume 
has dropped by 175 percent over the last five years 
proposals to restrict and tax futures trading will make overseas 
exchanges even more attractive he said 
during a panel discussion mahlmann and officials of the chicago 
mercantile exchange and the new york mercantile exchange complained 
about several proposals including 
a plan by the commodity futures trading commission to restrict 
dual trading 
a bush administration proposal for an 11cent fee on every 
futures trade to fund increased cftc surveillance of futures 
markets 
a push by the securities and exchange commission to gain 
regulatory authority over stockindex futures a market that is now 
regulated by the cftc 
the proposals grew out of the federal investigation of futures 
trading fraud in chicago and the stock market crash of october 1987 
mahlmann said he too is seeking a healthier environment in 
which to conduct business but one in which we can work with 
our regulators rather than one in which we stand the distinct 
possibility of being killed 
chicago mercantile exchange president william brodsky and new 
york mercantile exchange chairman lou gutterman also lashed out at 
the cftcs dualtrading proposal 
brodsky told cftc chairman wendy gramm who also sat on the 
discussion panel in this particular case you used a 
sledgehammer instead of a scapel 
mrs gramm avoided the dualtrading controversy in her remarks 
instead she urged the industry to fight harder to keep regulation 
of stockindex futures under the cftcs jurisdiction and away from 
the sec 
the sec which oversees stock trading has been gaining 
congressional support for its view that the stock and stockindex 
futures markets are so closely linked that they should be regulated 
by one agency 
dual trading is the practice among floor brokers of trading for 
their own accounts after executing any orders from their public 
customers 
critics contend dual trading enables floor brokers to take 
advantageous market positions ahead of large customer orders that 
they know are likely to move prices that illegal practice known 
as frontrunning is among the fraud schemes alleged in the 
indictments of 48 traders at the board of trade and the chicago 
merc 
but futures exchange officials maintain that dual trading 
increases the efficiency of their markets by increasing the number 
of buyers and sellers 
since november the cftc has been gathering public comments on 
its proposals for a test ban on dual trading in selected markets 
regardless of the exchanges ability to detect fraud 
the cftc plan is based on an agency study that found no 
statistical support for the exchanges claims that dual trading 
increases market liquidity 
exchange officials involved in the panel discussion cited other 
studies that dispute the cftcs findings 
mahlmann said the board of trade opposes any restrictions on 
dual trading even so he said the cftc proposal is especially 
galling 
the cftc plan to ban dual trading has no basis in fact he 
said it appears to be designed for the sake of political 
expediency rather than logic 
the chicago merc has voluntarily restricted dual trading in one 
of its most active markets the standard amp poors 500 stockindex 
futures pit 
brodsky said the merc supports a cftc reauthorization bill 
passed last year by the house of representatives that would ban 
dual trading in the most active futures markets but would allow it 
to resume at exchanges that have a failsafe system for detecting 
abuses a similar measure is pending in the senate 
the merc and the board of trade are working together to develop 
an electronic trading card that would replace the paper cards 
on which traders record their trades such a system the exchanges 
say would create a foolproof means of detecting dualtrading 
abuses

greyhound lines incs hiring of replacements for 
its striking bus drivers reflects a trend toward tougher management 
stances in labor squabbles and some experts say the hardball 
tactics will make it harder to settle the weekold walkout 
hiring replacements is far different from the old strikes we 
used to have said mark kahn a labor arbitrator and professor 
emeritus at wayne state university in detroit 
in the past he said there has been a clearcut understanding 
that whenever the dispute is ironed out those workers will go back 
to work and the company will resume its operations that tends to 
create a relatively civilized atmosphere in which answers can be 
worked out 
replacements are indicative of some of the more bitter 
confrontational disputes that we are seeing said mike jadell an 
arbitrator and a professor at georgia state university in atlanta 
its become an additional tool in the arsenal of those 
employers who feel that they are in adversarial relationships he 
said 
some labor experts trace the confrontational approach to the 
start of the probusiness reagan administration and its decision in 
1981 to fire striking air traffic controllers and replace them with 
new hires 
greyhounds strategy is similar to that of eastern airlines 
which sought to rebuild as a smaller carrier with lower costs by 
hiring new nonunion workers after its machinists pilots and 
flight attendants struck a year ago 
we dont have a lot of options said p anthony lannie 
greyhounds executive vice president and chief negotiator this 
union has us backed into a corner 
the attimes violent strike began early march 2 when the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions and the company 
failed to reach agreement on a new threeyear contract the union 
represents 9435 of greyhounds 11825 employees including 6300 
drivers 1600 office workers and 1475 maintenance workers 
the company says it can afford no more than its original 63 
million offer the union says its last proposal is less than 
greyhounds but the company values it at 205 million 
there has been little contact between the two sides since 
although federal mediators thursday asked for a factfinding 
meeting with the union next week followed by a similar session with 
the company 
greyhound has been operating at reduced levels since the strike 
using replacements hired and trained in the last two weeks plus any 
union members who cross picket lines 
lannie said thursday 800 permanent replacements plus an 
additional 368 union drivers are behind the wheels of the 
companys buses the company says it received more than 6500 
applications for jobs and will be able to operate a full schedule 
by the end of the month 
in other words a total of 3468 of the most junior people 
that are striking right now do not have jobs he said 
because demand is expected to be lower immediately after the 
strike lannie said the company will need fewer drivers initially 
leaving only about 2000 regular fulltime openings left to be 
filled 
the union has vowed to regain the jobs for its members 
when management is prepared to enter into good faith 
negotiations their union will ensure that their jobs and seniority 
are secured said union spokesman jeffrey nelson 
the management team that took over the only nationwide bus 
service three years ago is taking a much harsher stance than its 
predecessors 
in a 47day walkout in 1983 greyhound then owned by 
phoenixbased conglomerate greyhound corp hired replacements 
during the strike but then fired them to make room for returning 
union members 
experts say the companys new position is bolstered by events 
since then including a supreme court decision last year concerning 
a strike against trans world airlines inc that decision upheld a 
companys right to keep union members who crossed pickets lines 
lannie said 
most companies have had the right to hire replacements for 
decades although few exercised it kahn said 
its a very contentious issue he said its a way an 
employer can beat the strike but its the antithesis of sensible 
and rational efforts to resolve the dispute 
the outcomes got to be very bad especially for the employees 
who lose their jobs 
the use of replacements also raises the stakes for the union he 
said and makes it far more difficult for the union to agree to a 
settlement under which many of its members wont come back to 
work 
two bills have been introduced in congress that would limit the 
use of permanent replacements but kahn and others doubted they 
would pass 
just wednesday the house failed to override president bushs 
veto of a bill to create a commission on the yearold eastern 
airlines strike 
replacement workers also have been used international paper co 
boise cascade phelps dodge and easterns sister carrier 
continental airlines 
charles m rehmus a labor law professor at the university of 
san diego said it was the 1981 air controllers strike that gave 
replacements legitimacy 
it encouraged employers generally to operate through a strike 
and employees to cross picket lines he said

american express co has labeled totally 
without merit a series of classaction lawsuits by shearson 
lehman hutton inc shareholders charging the two firms with setting 
low a price in a huge stock buyback 
one lawsuit filed in delaware chancery court claims the buyback 
price of 1250 per shearson share little more than onethird the 
price at which american express sold the shares to the public three 
years ago is grossly unfair it claimed the stock is below 
its true value because of recent problems at the firm 
american express announced earlier this week it was purchasing 
the publicly held shares of its ailing securities unit as part of a 
plan that included a management overhaul 2000 layoffs this month 
and a 1 billion capital infusion 
american express initially had sought to reduce its 61 percent 
stake in shearson the lawsuit claims that the company timed its 
reversal in an effort to cap the market at its currently 
depressed level 
american express officials said a total of about 20 classaction 
lawsuits had been filed in delaware and new york courts 
we have reviewed several of the original complaints and we 
believe them to be totally without merit american express 
spokesman lawrence armour said thursday he added that the lawsuits 
were expected to be consolidated into one complaint in each state 
under the proposed buyback which must be approved by a special 
committee of three outside shearson directors american express 
will exchange 350 million of its own shares for 28 million 
publicly held shearson shares or 32 percent of the firm 
each outstanding share of shearson will be exchanged for 0426 
of a share of american express the deal is based on march 2 
closing new york stock exchange prices of 1250 a share for 
shearson and 2937 for american express 
shares of both companies have fallen since with shearson 
closing down 12 cents at 1175 thursday and american express 
unchanged at 2787 at that price the stock swap would value 
shearson at 1187 a share 
shearson shares were offered to the public at 34 each in march 
1987 the complaints claim the american express buyback undervalues 
the firms assets and potential worth 
lawsuits say american express violated a duty to shareholders to 
maximize the value of the firm they claim the offer price was not 
based on an evaluation of the company or on negotiations and 
therefore was unfair to shareholders 
one lawsuit claims american express used coercive and 
manipulative practices in a scheme to eliminate minority 
shareholders another says shearson is poised for future growth 
and earnings that public shareholders will miss out 
the lawsuits ask the courts to stop or reverse the stock buyback 
or award damages to shareholders 
a suit made public thursday in delaware where shearson is 
incorporated claims that primerica corp offered to invest 900 
million in exchange for a 40 percent stake in shearson during talks 
that ended last week without a deal and preceded the stock buyback 
proposal 
no figures about the negotiations with primerica which is 
headed by former shearson and american express executive sanford i 
weill have been released by the companies 
but individuals with knowledge of the talks said the 900 
million figure represented not an offer price but an estimated 
value of primericas smith barney harris upham amp co unit which 
would have been merged with shearson 
weill also offered to buy all of shearson but shearsons new 
chairman howard l clark jr former chief financial officer of 
american express opposed the deal according to the lawsuit

stunned by allegations of child labor law 
violations burger king corp said it maintains strict policies 
regarding young employees but will review work rules in its us 
restaurants 
an executive at the nations no 2 fastfood chain called the 
government suit a complete surprise and vowed to look into the 
charges

hesitate to use available legal processes in addition to 
investigative efforts to protect americas children mrs dole 
said thursday

from oct 30 1986 to the securities and exchange commission the 
funds will be placed in escrow for investors who were affected by 
gafs actions sec enforcement division attorney kevin mcenery said

the sec and a federal grand jury accused sherwin and gaf of 
manipulating the price of union carbide stock in collaboration with 
former stockbroker boyd l jefferies in october 1986 they sought

of union carbide at sherwins request gaf was trying to sell five 
million union carbide shares after the takeover for the larger 
chemicals concern failed 
the sec said the 125 million represents certain benefits 
received by gaf as a result of purchases of union carbide stock by 
jefferies amp co jefferies securities firm 
the government alleged that sherwin and jefferies agreed to have 
jefferies close the price of the common stock of union carbide at 
22 or higher and sherwin agreed to compensate jefferies for any 
losses 
testimony showed jefferies amp co bought 190100 shares of union 
carbide on oct 29 and 30 which helped raise the stock price 125 
cents to 22 and sold the stock a week later for a reported loss 
of 40000 gaf later sold five million carbide shares for 23 to 
salomon brothers inc

the national football league seems to be living 
proof that the rich keep getting richer 
the leagues television income soared to nearly 3 billion on 
thursday when cbs agreed to a fouryear contract that maintains its 
sunday nfl package the deal which cost the network 106 billion 
or 265 million a year includes rights to the 1992 super bowl in 
minneapolis 
we are tremendously pleased to continue our 34year 
association with the nfl and nfc games cbs sports president neal 
pilson said retaining our sunday package was a key element in 
our longterm corporate strategy of providing broadcast coverage of 
dominant sports franchises 
no matter apparently what it costs 
pilson had previously dipped into the cbs coffers for 106 
billion for four years of baseball 1 billion for seven years of 
the ncaa basketball tournament and 543 million for the next two 
winter olympics 
the cbs contract followed the nfls 900 million deal with abc 
for the monday night package an extra tier of playoff games which 
the league provided and the silver anniversary super bowl at tampa 
in 1991 
as appetizers for those two fancy network agreements nfl 
commissioner paul tagliabue and his television negotiators 
completed twin 450 million cable contracts with espn and tbs for 
sunday night games 
still to be heard from is nbc locked in negotiations for its 
piece of the nfl pie following expiration of its threeyear 360 
million deal 
including the nbc pact which the wall street journal reported 
could be signed as early as today the nfl could reap some 36 
billion in total for four years of television rights a 90 percent 
jump over the annual cost of the previous football contracts 
consider the increases in fees the league has already forged 
under its previous deal abc paid 120 million a year thats gone 
up to 2375 million per year in the new contract 
cbs previously had a threeyear 450 million contract the 
price tag on the current contract amounts to a 76 percent increase 
espn was paying 150 million for 24 regular season games and 
three pro bowls now with tbs added to the equation cable 
television antes up six times that figure

the average unemployment rate in the 12 
european community nations dipped to 86 percent in january from 
87 percent in december the ec statistics agency said friday 
henning christophersen ec commissioner for the economy said 
two very positive trends can be drawn from the recent 
unemployment statistics first unemployment is now falling or 
static in all member states and second youth unemployment is 
falling even faster 
the unemployment rate for people under 25 has fallen almost one 
percent over the last six months dropping from 172 percent to 163 
percent this compares with a more modest drop in unemployment as a 
whole from 89 to 86 percent over the same period 
unemployment was highest in ireland where 167 percent of the 
potential work force was out of work in january spain also has a 
high unemployment rate at 159 percent luxembourg with only 18 
percent of its work force out of a job had the lowest rate 
followed by portugal at 49 percent 
rates in other countries were belgium 91 percent denmark 
64 percent west germany 54 percent france 94 percent italy 
109 percent netherlands 90 percent britain 61 percent 
figures for greece were unavailable 
christophersen said the community had the possibility over a 
few years to eliminate mass unemployment as we have known it since 
the end of the 70s particularly against the background of both the 
coordinated economic policy mix in the member states and in the 
light of the events and opening markets of central and eastern 
europe

carl icahn plans to spend as much as 10 
million on a campaign to convince usx corp shareholders that 
everyone will benefit from his proposal to sell the companys steel 
division 
i feel its very compelling and i certainly hope they will 
he said in a telephone interview i feel it will not only enhance 
shareholder value but also be good for other constituencies 
icahns proposal will be put to a nonbinding shareholder vote 
under an agreement announced thursday 
in exchange for the vote icahn usxs biggest shareholder 
agreed not to wage a proxy fight or submit other matters for 
consideration at the steel oil and gas giants may 7 annual 
meeting usx said 
stockholders will be asked whether usx should incorporate a 
separate steel business and spin off at least 80 percent of it 
icahn said in documents filed with the securities and exchange 
commission the new company would carry no more than 15 billion 
in longterm debt 
icahn chairman of trans world airlines inc said in the filing 
he will spend 5 million to 10 million on the campaign to persuade 
shareholders 
usx which will not be bound by the outcome said in a statement 
it opposes the resolution as not in the best interest of 
stockholders but would give due consideration to the results of 
such vote in determining its future course of action 
usx stock rose 1 to 3662 a share thursday in heavy trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
under a bylaw amendment approved by the companys board in 
january icahn was required to tell usx by the close of business 
thursday whether he would nominate his own slate of directors at 
the annual meeting 
icahn owns nearly 34 million or 1326 percent of the companys 
outstanding common shares he has long been unhappy with usx 
management and believes the companys stock price is too low 
icahn had argued in favor of the sale of usxs marathon oil amp 
gas subsidiary which usx management does not want to sell 
in 1988 he waged an unsuccessful proxy battle at texaco inc 
hoping to unseat the oil companys board and force a restructuring 
to boost texacos stock price 
charles a bradford a steel industry analyst said this may be 
a bad time to sell the steel division known as us steel 
it would be quite difficult to get a good value for the steel 
division today with the state of the stock market today he said 
bradford said potential buyers could be scared off by usxs 57 
billion longterm debt 
about 65 percent of usxs revenues comes from its energy 
division while about 31 percent comes from steel usx spokesman 
william keslar said 
the steel divisions operating income totaled 430 million in 
1989 compared with 501 million in 1988 the reduced income was 
due partly to the sale of the lorain ohio steel works to a 50 
percentowned joint venture in the second quarter of 1989 
the annual meeting will be held at marathons headquarters in 
findlay ohio

senate leaders today abandoned efforts to 
complete key parts of a clean air bill before an upcoming weeklong 
recess after a dispute emerged over whether the government should 
provide 700 million in assistance to coal miners 
the coal miner assistance proposal aimed at helping workers who 
lose their jobs because of tougher acid rain emission controls 
threatened a compromise agreement on clean air legislation with the 
white house which has vigorously opposed the measure as being too 
expensive 
it has become apparent that we cannot complete action on the 
bill this week said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine he said he expected the remainder of the day to focus 
primarily on the coal miner assistance proposal 
senate leaders had been prepared thursday night to bring the 
amendment offered by sen robert byrd dwva to a vote but 
when debate dragged beyond midnight action was postponed 
mitchell said negotiations were under way with the white house 
to attempt to work out an agreement but he said he was opposed to 
the assistance plan and said he accepts the view of senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan that the issue could scuttle the 
compromise agreement with the bush administration 
the delay on the byrd amendment prompted speculation that 
mitchell did not have the votes to block the proposal mitchell 
told reporters today he did not know what the vote count was 
mitchell had threatened all week to hold the senators in session 
into saturday if necessary to work out key provisions of the clean 
air legislation but he said today that a list of remaining 
amendments would be assembled for action after senate returns march 
20 after its weeklong recess 
he said he did not anticipate action on other major amendments 
including several strengthening auto pollution control proposals 
until the coal miner issue was resolved 
byrd called the measure a safety net for as many as 5000 
miners who will lose their jobs because stringent controls on 
sulfur dioxide will force midwest utilities to shift to other than 
highsulfur coal to power their plants 
the amendment was one of several before the senate that 
conflicts with the compromise agreement reached last month between 
senate leaders and the white house on the scope of the air 
pollution control bill the administration has been adamant in 
opposing provisions that would increase the expense of the 
legislation which in its present form would cost the economy about 
21 billion a year 
earlier thursday the senate in a 6633 vote rejected an 
amendment to require additional toxic emission controls on 
automobiles senate leaders called it a deal breaker because of 
strong opposition by the white house which objected to its 
reported 15 billion price tag 
but the byrd coal miner safety net amendment prompted the 
strongest debate and behindthescenes maneuvering 
if this amendment is passed its over declared sen bob 
dole rkan referring to the byrd proposal the administration 
doesnt like this amendment one bit and that would be an 
understatement 
mitchell said discussions were continuing with the white house 
on a compromise that would satisfy both the administration and byrd 
and clear the way for a vote on the proposal today 
the clean air measure represents the first tightening of federal 
air pollution control laws in 13 years it calls for sweeping curbs 
on smogcausing pollution from automobiles and industrial plants 
and requires new cuts in acid rain pollutants from coalfired 
electric power plants 
a similar bill remains in committee in the house 
byrd who for many years when he was majority leader blocked 
acid rain legislation to protect west virginia miners had been 
seeking 13 billion to provide miners who lose jobs because of the 
new pollution controls with full or partial salaries for six years 
he later cut back the proposal to four years with an estimated 
cost of 700 million 
the senator argued that his proposal was no different than the 
federal governments bailout of new york city its assistance 
program for railroaders after the penn central went bankrupt or 
federal aid to victims of the san francisco earthquake and 
hurricane hugo 
a disaster is a disaster and im talking about a disaster that 
is going to hit the coal fields byrd told his colleagues 
but dole and other senators said that if the coal miners are 
helped so should workers in other industries who might lose their 
jobs because of the sweeping pollution controls envisioned by the 
clean air bill

the white house today denied a report that 
president bush is unlikely to reappoint federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan when his term expires in august 1991 because of 
greenspans refusal to push interest rates down further 
the los angeles times today quoted an unidentified longtime bush 
adviser as saying the president is mad as hell about 
greenspans position on interest rates and will seek a new fed 
chief 
i deny the story bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said at 
the regular white house briefing were not angry 
also at the briefing was michael boskin chairman of the 
presidents council of economic advisers who said of the story 
its out of left field 
boskin said there hasnt been any discussion about whether 
bush should reappoint greenspan 
i have not even begun to think about that issue nor do i 
think has the president boskin said 
the president and chairman greenspan as well as treasury 
secretary brady and myself and others in the administration have 
good working relations with the federal reserve boskin said 
the administration has on occassion publicly called for lower 
interest rates comments widely interpreted as an attempt to 
pressure the fed to ease monetary policy as part of an effort to 
spark the economy which since last year has shown signs of 
weakness 
greenspan told congress two weeks ago that the threat of 
recession has faded and that he was unlikely to encourage rates to 
fall a move that could push inflation higher

the soviet union has formally applied for observer 
status with the general agreement on tariffs and trade a spokesman 
for the 96nation world trade forum said friday 
david woods said evgeny makeyev soviet ambassador in geneva 
submitted the application thursday and asked that the request be 
considered at the next gatt council meeting scheduled for april 3 
observer status would enable the soviet union to examine gatt 
and the preconditions for full membership while also keeping 
trading partners up to date with moscows economic restructuring 
program woods said 
members of the marketorientated organization which draws up 
agreements to liberalize global commerce and mediates trade 
disputes account for more than fourfifths of world trade 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was 
wide support for moscow to become involved in gatt before the end 
of the year but they added the application was unlikely to be 
approved as quickly as next month 
although observer status would not automatically entitle the 
soviet union to multilateral trading concessions enjoyed by full 
gatt members it would give moscow firsthand knowledge of changes 
in the world trading system such information is necessary to back 
up soviet economic and trade reforms 
but the soviet union would not be privy to talks on 
comprehensive new agreements to liberalize trade in areas such as 
agriculture and textiles that are being drawn up as part of the 
ambitious uruguay round of negotiations scheduled to end in 
december 
around 30 countries are observers at gatt including china 
which is seeking full membership 
at last decembers malta summit us president george bush said 
he would back moscows bid for observer status the united states 
had previously opposed any soviet involvement on the grounds that 
the soviet economic system was incompatible with gatts free trade 
principles

it was an unlikely snapshot of chicago 
mercantile exchange chief leo melamed sauntering past a turquoise 
swimming pool sporting a black silk shirt and pale yellow slacks 
he was smiling and tossing a small package perhaps a giveaway 
from a vendor at the futures industry association convention in the 
sprawling pink boca raton hotel 
melamed is known more for operating in hyperdrive whether hes 
proclaiming the global importance of the financial futures he 
fathered defending his industry against critics creating new 
worlds of science fiction or imagining new ways of managing risk 
trader lawyer author visionary leo melamed is considered 
the renaissance man of the futures markets once the domain of pork 
farmers and grain merchants 
his surprise retirement at years end from the dual role of 
special counsel to the merc and chairman of the boards executive 
committee will leave a void in the leadership of an industry 
fighting to preserve turf and reputation 
time will allow us to find other people melamed said when 
he announced his retirement march 5 theyre around and they will 
come forward 
even his main competitor chicago board of trade chairman 
karsten mahlmann says melameds contributions will be missed if 
he wants to become more of a private citizen the whole industry 
will feel his loss 
melamed graying but fitlooking at 57 says his only plans are 
to write memoirs publish a sequel to his sciencefiction novel 
the tenth planet do some trading and spend more time with his 
family 
but he is not likely to stroll far from the scuffling heart of 
the markets he nurtured 
robert wilmouth president of the national futures association 
an industryfunded watchdog agency that melamed helped found in 
1982 predicts that if the industry needs someone to lead it 
through tomorrows thickets leo is going to be holding the 
light 
melamed said he will be around to offer advice and when pressed 
on possible career moves said ill see what comes along the 
way 
his most notable achievement was the creation in the early 1970s 
of financial futures contracts riskmanagement tools used by large 
institutional investors around the world pension funds banks 
even governments rely on melameds invention to lock in returns on 
stocks bonds and currency trades 
these highfinance instruments are traded exactly the same way 
as pork belly and soybean futures from chicago to sydney traders 
crowd pits yell bids and furiously flash hand signals 
it is raucous adrenalinpumping and confounding it is melamed 
said in a speech last week at the convention an industry i loved 
from the very first moment that by sheer accident i came upon 
it 
that was around 1953 when melamed son of polish immigrant 
schoolteachers took a job at the merc as a runner for merrill 
lynch to earn his way through law school 
egg futures were the mercs main product line then but as he 
rose from runner to trader to chairman in 1969 melamed saw a 
deadend in limiting futures trading to the world of basic 
commodities 
he saw an opportunity to exploit fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates freed to float by an international agreement in 
1971 
a disciple of economist milton friedmans freemarket 
philosophy melamed envisioned a market for international currency 
futures where you could ensure a guaranteed price in yen for your 
dollars or pounds for your francs he took his idea to washington 
there at 33 melamed called on then treasury secretary george 
shultz federal reserve chairman arthur burns and alan greenspan 
then head of the presidents council of economic advisers for 
reaction 
they liked it he said in greenspans office i suggested 
that the markets we were creating in chicago might be beneficial to 
the american economy in an instant he stood up from his desk and 
literally reeled off a litany of uses that i had never dreamed 
possible for futures markets in treasury bills certificates of 
deposit tbonds and the like 
the merc launched its first currency futures contracts in 1972 
when annual us futures trading volume totaled 183 million 
contracts 
last year more than 267 million futures contracts were traded 
on us exchanges and more than 60 percent were products such as 
currency bond and stockindex futures 
melameds biggest project in recent years has been guiding the 
development of globex an electronic trading system that he sees 
linking us european and far eastern financial markets to create 
a 24hour exchange he expects it to begin operation by midyear 
melameds creations have not been free of controversy 
stockindex futures for example which allow investors to control 
large amounts of stock at low cost have been blamed by some 
experts for volatility in the stock market 
the securities and exchange commission appears to be advancing 
in its quest to wrest regulatory control over index futures away 
from the less intrusive commodity futures trading commission 
melamed finds the prospect distasteful though hes willing to 
compromise others in the futures industry abhor it fearing the 
sec will regulate them out of business 
in another blow to the industry 26 traders from the mercs 
japanese yen and swiss franc pits were among 48 people indicted 
last year on fraud charges stemming from an fbi sting operation at 
the merc and the board of trade 
but melamed has not been sullied he was praised by washington 
and the industry for quickly responding to the crisis 
if i were to do it all over again he said this is what i 
would do and that is how i would do it and i would regret nothing 
along the way

suggesting that the economy had regained more momentum than many 
analysts had thought 
that was interpreted as a plus for the outlook for corporate 
profits which have been weak lately

pressure on interest rates and seemed to dim whatever chances 
might have existed for any easing of the federal reserves credit

drexel burnham lambert group inc and its 
creditors agreed today to a plan to operate the company and its 
subsidiaries during bankruptcy proceedings for the collapsed wall 
street firm 
also attorneys for the committee of unsecured creditors said 
they would oppose an attempt by the securities and exchange 
commission to be admitted to the committee drexel still owes the 
sec 150 million to settle securities fraud charges brought last 
year 
under the oversight scheme which was was approved by us 
bankruptcy judge howard buschman iii a panel of three drexel board 
members would oversee the firms liquidation 
four representatives of drexels committee of unsecured 
creditors would attend daily board meetings receive information 
about the companys operations and have input into the liquidation 
drexels creditors dropped a plan to ask buschman to appoint an 
examiner to run the company during the bankruptcy case which 
drexel said would have hamstrung operations such as the 
timesensitive sale of securities 
the compromise agreement follows more than a week of 
negotiations in which drexel forestalled the appointment of an 
examiner and the creditors gained access to the firms liquidation 
it applies to the parent company and subsidiaries principally the 
brokerage drexel burnham lambert inc 
the deal also prevents for now the creditors from trying to 
force the subsidiaries which are not subject to the bankruptcy 
case into a chapter 7 liquidation monitored by the court 
drexel still is trying to sell off about 1 billion in junk bond 
holdings and other assets creditors have said they are concerned 
that the company was not receiving fair value for its assets 
under the agreement creditors with access to drexels inner 
workings will not have veto power over deals made by the firm but 
can file protests with the bankruptcy judge 
the threemember drexel panel is comprised of chairman john sr 
shad a former sec chairman roderick hills a washington lawyer 
and former sec chairman and ralph saul a former american stock 
exchange president 
drexel filed for bankruptcy protection feb 13 after defaulting 
on 100 million in shortterm debt and failing to raise new credit 
the firm was hardhit by a drop in the junk bond market 
the sec has the largest claim in the case but was not included 
on the 17member creditors committee it has filed a request with 
the judge to be appointed 
but marc kirschner a lawyer for the committee said creditors 
would oppose the move buschman indicated the sec should play some 
role on the panel but said the final decision rested with the us 
trustees office

digital equipment corp will substantially expand 
its voluntary severance program to eliminate thousands of employees 
and slash expenses as it contends with a slumping us computer 
market officials said friday 
digital officials would not give specific figures on how many 
employees might be cut saying the plan was still being prepared 
but brad allen manager of shareholder relations said the number 
was in the ballpark of previously estimated figures 
industry analysts have said digital which employs about 125900 
people worldwide and more than 70000 in the united states wants 
to pare its staff by at least 5000 and eventually redeploy as many 
as 15000 employees in new jobs 
the momentum has picked up the program definitely will be 
expanded allen said adding the program was to be implemented by 
the end of the companys fiscal year on june 30 
digital spokeswoman nikki richardson said the program will be 
similar to a package offered last year to 700 employees at the 
companys manufacturing plant in salem nh 
in that plan which has been accepted by 260 workers so far 
employees choosing to participate received a cash payment based on 
years of service as well as medical dental and life insurance 
coverage for one year 
workers with up to two years of service for example received 
40 weeks of pay those with three to 10 years got 40 weeks plus 
three weeks for each year between three and 10 years 
we are looking at all transition programs on a 
businessbybusiness basis richardson said what is 
implemented will be based on the salem model 
digital the worlds secondlargest computer company behind 
international business machines corp saw its earnings fall 39 
percent for the six months ended dec 31 
the company based in suburban maynard blames the drop on a 
lackluster computer market in the united states which has forced 
other companies to make cutbacks as well 
digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from 
manufacturing to sales

bank of new england corp named lawrence k fish 
as its chairman and chief executive friday as officials continued 
restructuring the troubled company in an effort to restore 
financial health and public confidence 
while there has been considerable speculation about 
candidates mr fish was our first choice and the only one to 
receive an offer from us peter l scott head of the executive 
search said in a statement 
analysts generally praised the decision to hire fish a former 
bank of boston corp executive vice president but they warned he 
might not be able to rescue the bank 
hes coming into a situation thats very grave said gerard 
cassidy an analyst with tucker anthony inc if the economy does 
not cooperate a miracle worker is going to have a hard time a 
major part of it is out of his hands 
fish whose hiring was expected for more than a week replaces 
walter connolly who oversaw the banks dramatic growth in the 
1980s but was ousted this year after the company suffered massive 
losses 
much of the trouble has been traced to the banks aggressive 
lending practices during a construction boom in the mid1980s when 
the economy slowed near the end of the decade the real estate 
market tumbled and the bank was saddled with a mountain of problem 
loans 
last month the bank announced it lost 111 billion in 1989 and 
disclosed it was reviewing financial data from previous quarters to 
see whether larger provisions against bad loans should have been 
made earlier in the year 
the bank also is operating under federal consent orders signed 
last week which place the corporation under strict government 
oversight while it takes steps to fix its problems 
under the orders the bank must tighten its lending practices 
withhold stock dividends and review the work of its senior level 
management to see where changes should be made 
fish has to come down like a ton of bricks on some 
situations cassidy said its fresh blood he can come in and 
make the decisions 
fish 45 left bank of boston in 1988 to become president and 
chief operating officer of columbia savings amp loan association in 
beverly hills calif 
part of his job at columbia was to produce a plan to make the 
institution less reliant on high risk high yield junk bonds 
fish resigned last august and since then columbia has suffered 
with a crash in the junk bond market 
the newly appointed chairman said in a prepared statement friday 
that he believed in the bank of new englands soundness and 
strength but acknowledged the road to financial recovery could 
be long 
we have significant problems i plan to be thoughtful but 
to make decisions promptly said fish who was also named 
chairman and ceo of the bank of new englands massachusetts 
subsidiary

the sultan of brunei on friday denied any role in 
the 1 billion takeover of harrods owner house of fraser plc by the 
alfayed brothers in 1985 
the sultan said in a statement that he had no part in the 
takeover nor did he provide funds to mohamed salah and ali 
alfayed to help them buy it 
the ruler of brunei acknowledged that a power of attorney 
privilege was granted to mohamed alfayed to buy the dorchester 
hotel for the sultan 
if this privilege was used for something else it was done so 
totally without the sultans authority or knowledge the statement 
said 
on wednesday the government released a report by department of 
trade and industry inspectors saying the alfayeds lied about their 
wealth and background to succeed with the bid and that it was 
likely they used their association with the sultan to enable them 
to obtain funds toward the takeover 
they said they believed the alfayeds did not have enough money 
of their own to buy the retailing group 
the evidence pointing to brunei is very strong indeed the 
report said and we have conveyed our findings to the sultan our 
views stand 
the alfayeds deny they misled anyone and maintain that they 
paid for house of fraser with their own cash 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said tuesday he would not seek 
disqualification of any of the companys directors 
the serious fraud office and the director of the public 
prosecutions announced last week they would not pursue a criminal 
prosecution in connection with the takeover

sen richard lugar the ranking republican on 
the senate agriculture committee introduced a farm bill friday 
that would freeze at current levels the target prices for crops 
regulated by the government 
the measure reflects most of the proposals laid out in february 
by the bush administration for the 1990 farm bill 
it goes a step further however by speaking to target prices 
which the administration avoided 
financial analysts have said that even keeping the prices steady 
could push the farm bill beyond the administrations proposed 
budget depending on the world commodities market 
we may need to find savings in agricultural programs this 
year but we cannot yet estimate how much said lugar rind 
my purpose today is to introduce a farm bill and not a budget 
reconciliation bill 
he said his bill had no price tag but estimated it could cost 
less than the approximately 10 billion currently spent on 
agriculture programs if market conditions are right and no weather 
disaster occurs 
target prices are what the government decides a farmer should 
get in the marketplace for wheat corn sorghum barley oats rice 
and upland and extralong staple cotton these commodities often 
are called program crops because farmers that grow them 
participate in the federal commodities program 
if the market price is below the governments target price the 
government pays the farmer the difference known as a deficiency 
payment 
congress sets target prices every five years when it passes a 
farm bill lawmakers say they want to send the 1990 legislation to 
the president by the end of the summer 
lugars bill which also emphasizes flexible planting options 
for farmers who grow program crops is similar to legislation 
introduced wednesday by sen rudy boschwitz rminn another 
member of the agriculture committee 
boschwitz calls his bill the farm flexibility act of 1990 it 
also calls for a freeze on target prices 
flexibility has been stressed by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter in promoting the administrations proposals he says the 
government will save money on deficiency payments if farmers are 
allowed to let market demand determine their planting decisions 
his proposals and the lugar and boschwitz bills safeguard farm 
income by allowing the farmer to collect deficiency payments based 
on whatever program crop dominates the acreage even if the market 
losses are on another crop the farmer has decided to experiment 
with that year 
yeutter says farmers also would be encouraged to rotate crops 
which will be good for the soil and reduce the need for chemicals 
today rigid planting rules often lock farmers into planting 
the same crop on the same land year after year said lugar 
past farm legislation has encouraged planting of socalled 
program crops such as corn even when market demand calls for 
more production of nonprogram crops such as soybeans as a result 
the united states loses foreign markets 
boschwitz said he came up with his proposal after holding 150 
meetings on farms across minnesota 
farmers have told me that they would enjoy having the freedom 
to adjust their crop mix in response to the market and consumer 
demands boschwitz said 
he and lugar said farmers are happy with the 1985 law both 
senators said their bills would basically extend that law 
an aide to sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
agriculture committee said many committee members will be 
introducing farm bills this month 
they all will be placed together for review of the committee and 
debate over which provisions from each should be part of the final 
bill voted on by the senate the aide said

drexel burnham lambert group inc creditors will 
receive confidential company information but no veto power over 
asset sales under a bankruptcy court agreement reached friday on 
managing liquidation of the collapsed wall street firm 
also attorneys for drexels unsecured creditors said they would 
oppose a move by the securities and exchange commission to join 
their committee drexel still owes the sec 150 million from its 
1989 settlement of securities fraud charges 
opposition to an sec role on the committee centers on 500 
million drexel already has paid the government that creditors have 
said they may seek to recover for repayment of debts 
but us bankruptcy judge howard buschman iii indicated the sec 
which has the largest claim against drexel necessarily would have 
a role in the case even if it was not on the creditors committe 
it is very hard to imagine a chapter 11 case disaffecting 
the single largest unsecured creditor regardless of what hat they 
wear buschman said 
under the oversight scheme approved by buschman a panel of 
three drexel board members would oversee the firms liquidation of 
about 1 billion in junk bond holdings and other assets 
a subcommittee of four creditors would attend daily meetings of 
the group receive highly confidential commercial information 
about planned transactions by 6 pm and attend a meeting the 
following morning on sales the creditors will not have veto power 
over deals but can contest sales with the bankruptcy judge 
drexel creditors had sought and then dropped a request for an 
examiner to run drexel during the bankruptcy proceedings which the 
firm said would have hampered such operations as the timesensitive 
sale of securities 
creditors wanted access to drexels inner workings because of 
concerns the company is not receiving fair value for its assets 
the creditors also will have access to information about past 
transactions including nearly 200 million in cash bonuses paid in 
december and january 
the compromise applies to the parent company and to its 
subsidiaries including the brokerage unit drexel burnham lambert 
inc which are not subject to the bankruptcy case all asset sales 
by the parent company still must be approved by buschman 
by granting creditors a role in the firms operations the deal 
apparently forestalls for now any bid to force the subsidiaries 
into a chapter 7 liquidation which would be monitored by the court 
drexel attorney alan miller said the arrangement ensures the 
process has integrity and every effort is being made to do the best 
possible job in the winddown of these entities 
the threemember drexel panel is company chairman john sr 
shad a former sec chairman roderick hills a washington lawyer 
and former sec chairman and ralph saul a former american stock 
exchange president 
the three who will be paid 190000 a year were named as an 
oversight committee to drexel as part of the firms settlement of 
civil securities fraud charges with the sec last april 
the four creditors on the subcommittee are first city bancorp 
of texas home capital services inc equitable capital management 
corp and copenhagen handelsbank 
drexel filed for bankruptcy protection feb 13 after defaulting 
on 100 million in shortterm debt and failing to obtain new 
credit the firm was hardhit by a drop in the junk bond market and 
its own legal problems 
the sec was not included on the 17member committee representing 
drexel creditors it has filed a motion to be appointed and has 
been negotiating a place on the committee a move opposed by the 
creditors 
the committee has granted another large creditor the california 
employees retirement system a nonvoting place on the committee 
lead creditor first city has said it may seek repayment of 
drexel debts from money the firm paid the government last year in 
resolving criminal and civil insider trading and other fraud 
charges 
of the total 650 million in penalties 300 million was paid in 
fines to the justice department and 200 million to an escrow 
account to satisfy possible investor claims against the firm 
drexel still owes 150 million to the account

futures prices for soybeans and corn advanced 
but wheat was lower at the close friday on the chicago board of 
trade 
a resurgence of export business and an active soymeal cash 
market overseas supported soybean futures said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc 
also south american rains could delay the start of the harvest 
there said karlin the soybean advance spilled over into corn 
and gave that market a boost 
wheat prices were depressed by rain forecasts for this weekend 
over us growing areas said walter spilka analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 383 a bushel corn was cent 
to 1 cent higher with march at 243 a bushel oats were 1 cent 
to 2 cents higher with march at 146 a bushel and soybeans

three california metropolitan areas 
riversidesan bernardino los angeleslong beach and sacramento 
were among the top five in the nation in singlefamily home 
building activity in 1989 the national association of home 
builders reported friday 
the riversidesan bernardino area with 38200 building permits 
topped the list for the second straight year 
it was followed by the los angeleslong beach area with 23640 
permits washington dc with 22360 atlanta with 21750 and 
sacramento with 16540 
the home builders said 938000 singlefamily building permits 
were issued nationally last year down from 1005000 in 1988 
multifamily permits dropped from 458000 in 1988 to 403000 in 1989 
high interest rates at different times during the year coupled 
with a sluggish economy affordability problems and consumer 
hesitance caused total permits for singlefamily and multifamily 
housing to drop from 1463000 in 1988 to 1341000 last year 
said home builders president martin perlman 
this is the lowest number of permits issued since 1982 during 
the most recent recession when 1 million units were authorized 
he said although at present we expect housing activity in 1990 
to closely mirror last years performance it could drop 
considerably if interest rates continue to climb as they have in 
recent weeks 
the housing and manufacturing industries were hardest hit as the 
federal reserve raised interest rates as it sought to stem 
inflation last year 
fixedrate 30year mortgages rose to an average 1122 percent 
in march before dropping into the single digits in july according 
to weekly surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
rates surged back over the 10 percent threshhold in midaugust 
dropped back into the single digits in october and remainded there 
until january when they topped 10 percent again they stood at 
1029 percent on friday 
another factor that could cause housing activity to drop off 
is the availability of funds for acquisition and development of 
land and construction of new homes perlman said noting the 
savings and loan bailout law limits the amount of money thrifts can 
loan 
despite heading the singlefamily list the number of permits 
issued in the riversidesan bernadino area was 112 percent below

a swiss company launched a cigarette named for 
mikhail s gorbachev on friday figuring that a popular kremlin 
leader might be just the guy to knock the marlboro man off his 
horse 
the company plans to invade the us market next with the 
cigarette which it calls gorbatchow enticing smokers with its 
slogan a taste of freedom 
the world health organization was less than enthusiastic about 
the launch of the new brand the un agency estimates that nearly 
3 million people will die this year from tobaccorelated illnesses 
such as cancer and heart disease 
peter studer owner of the small company that introduced the 
brand in geneva on friday said the name gorbatchow was formed 
by mixing spellings of the soviet presidents name in various 
languages 
the mediumstrength cigarette is a blend of 21 types of tobacco 
some soviet some american 
studer said in an interview that cigarette smokers need a new 
image 
we think people are bored with a tired cowboy on an almost 
dead horse he said an apparent reference to the advertisements 
for marlboro cigarettes which are popular in the soviet union 
he said he had not sought permission from moscow to use the 
presidents name 
studer plans to travel to the united states on saturday in 
preparation for the launch of gorbatchow international in north 
america and he said he has high hopes for sales 
posters announcing the cigarettes debut on the swiss market 
friday heralded gorbatchow international breaks through the 
wall joining the ranks of western companies rushing to 
capitalizing on the crumbling of the berlin wall 
just as gorbachev is changing the world so the new gorbatchow 
heralds perestroika on the international cigarette market gushed 
the accompanying publicity material 
the cigarette was first sold in dutyfree shops in hungary and 
bulgaria last may 
ironically soviet smokers are as yet unable to sample the 
cigarette named after their leader but studer said he has plans to 
introduce it in hard currency shops in moscow aimed chiefly at 
american tourists 
gorbachev has never been seen smoking in public although he 
reportedly once took a puff in canada cigarette use is widespread 
in the soviet union which has only a mild antismoking campaign 
the genevabased who is urging its member countries to ban 
promotion of all tobacco 
we are against anything which leads to an overall increase in 
consumption of cigarettes said dr clare chollattraquet of the 
tobacco or health program

shooting biobullets at 
diseased big horn sheep wasnt exactly what fred paul envisioned 
when he began tinkering with a new idea for bb guns 
as a researcher for 3m co paul was experimenting with a 
safeshooting waterfilled bb when he casually splattered a 
shot on his office wall 
suddenly it hit me paul said what i had wasnt a gun it 
was a longrange delivery device 
fifteen years and more than 8 million later pauls privately 
owned ballistivet inc is arming ranchers and wildlife 
veterinarians with guns that shoot soluble bullets packed with 
freezedried vaccines 
if his vision materializes biobullets will dominate syringes 
in the 1 billion vaccine sector of the animal health industry the 
company also is targeting the 4 billion market of antibiotics 
wormers fertility drugs and other pharmaceuticals 
this is a real buck rogers deal its goofy said dr jerry 
swanson veterinarian for hitch enterprises a 160000head feed 
lot business in oklahoma and kansas but its really taking off 
pretty soon every cowboy in the high plains will have one of these 
guns sticking out of his truck window 
for now the company has only 14 employees controls less than 1 
percent of the animal vaccine market and isnt expected to make a 
profit until 1991 
but paul who extracted the technology from 3m in 1983 expects 
sales to triple this year to about 3 million biobullets in 
addition the company is moving to a new plant capable of making up 
to 100 million doses a year 
swanson said the biobullet has distinguished itself by adding 
speed comfort dosage uniformity and sterility to the vaccination 
process the units fired rapidly from up to 50 feet away 
penetrate flank muscles and dissolve 
most important swanson said biobullets spare cattle the 
stress of syringe inoculations because heavy handling can disrupt a 
bovines eating habits for up to three days 
dr david jessup wildlife veterinarian for the california fish 
and game department in rancho cordova said the patented invention 
has vastly improved the fight against a pneumoniaproducing virus 
killing large numbers of lambs in a herd of big horn sheep ranging 
the santa rosa mountains near sacramento 
for us this is a godsend jessup said any alternative to 
having to catch animals is quite useful 
ron eis project manager of bioproduction development at rival 
smithkline beecham animal health products in omaha neb said 
biobullets are a wellcrafted alternative to syringes when used on 
wild or unpenned animals 
its not going to revolutionize the market and i dont think 
you are every going to replace the syringe eis said but it is 
quite quick and quite easy and there is a niche in the market for 
that 
in western wyoming game wardens are aiming biobullets at a 
herd of 22000 elk to vaccinate against brucellosis a bacterial 
disease that kills unborn elk 
its the biggest wildlife disease program in north america 
said tom thorne of the wyoming game and fish department the 
ballistivet gun is kind of the lynch pin to the whole thing 
the system also has been used on wild game in africa and south 
america but its biggest potential as a moneymaker is in the 
domestic beef industry which includes 110 million cattle 
paul and ballistivet president donald sturtevant wouldnt 
disclose sales projections but their product now sells for 47 
cents to 53 cents apiece about four times as much as syringe doses 
paul said 3m invested 2 million to 3 million to develop 
biobullets but decided in 1983 that they didnt fit with its 
business instead of killing the project 3m accepted royalties 
from paul who raised 500000 in a private stock offering to form 
ballistivet a year later he kept the company alive by taking out a 
second mortgage on his hobby farm 
we laughingly said at the time and it was true that we bet 
the farm on it paul said 
since then the company has raised 6 million in private stock 
sales and has avoided sizable bank debt it is marketing the 
product through distributors who handle other veterinary products 
keith eastman of northstar ventures inc a minneapolisst paul 
venture capital firm with a 20 percent stake in ballistivet said 
paul has operated the company as a classic entrepreneur 
he developed a dream and knows all the reasons that it will be 
successful and he refuses to give up on it eastman said 
the payoff may not be far away sturtevant said major drug 
manufacturers have shown interest in purchasing the company which 
would bring a windfall to ballistivet investors and executives 
freds earlyon dream is very very close to being a complete 
reality sturtevant said

american home products corp has agreed to sell 
its boylemidway home products business to reckitt and colman plc 
for 125 billion the companies announced friday 
the acquisition by reckitt and colman which makes colman 
mustards and other products is part of its strategy to increase 
its household products operations and expand in the united states 
and europe 
a joint statement from the companies gave no reason why american 
home products decided to sell boylemidway whose products include 
woolite laundry soap and easyoff oven cleaner 
however the division was outside american home products core 
pharmaceuticals business and contributed less than 10 percent of 
its 675 billion sales in 1989 
proceeds of the sale conceivably could be used to reduce the 
debt american home products took on last year in its 32 billion 
acquisition of ah robins co 
john considine a company spokesman was not in his office when 
a reporter called for comment 
reckitt and colman has acquired several other us businesses in 
recent years including the durkee foods business and airwick air 
fresheners operations 
we think its a very attractive deal ian white an analyst 
at the london investment firm kleinwort benson ltd said of the 
boylemidway purchase it would have been hard to think of 
anything which would fit better 
reckitt and colman spent four years trying to persuade american 
home products to sell the operations white said 
steve plag an analyst with barclays de zoete wedd ltd said 
such a move is necessary for reckitt and colman if it wants to 
make doubledigit growth in the years ahead 
the british companys existing products are in mature slower 
growing sectors of their markets 
boylemidway is about half the size of reckitt and colmans 
household products and toiletries division it had pretax profit of 
91 million in 1989 and its 667 million in sales were spread 
through the united states canada france west germany and spain 
similar reckitt and colman businesses had pretax profit of 117 
million pounds or 191 million on sales of 817 million pounds or 
13 billion last year the company did not provide aftertax 
profit figures 
reckitt and colman said the purchase was to be funded in part by 
selling to existing shareholders 200 million pounds or 326 
million in bonds which are convertible into stock 
the balance of the acquisitions cost will be financed through 
bank borrowing and the sales of assets valued at about 50 million 
the company said

the white house on friday emphatically denied 
a report that president bush was mad as hell at alan greenspan 
but some private economists said the federal reserve chairman was 
being given a blunt message to lower interest rates or risk losing 
his job 
the los angeles times in its friday editions quoted a longtime 
bush adviser as saying greenspans refusal to further lower 
interest rates made it extremely unlikely greenspan would be 
reappointed fed chairman when his term expires in august 1991 
the unidentified adviser said bush was mad as hell over 
greenspans position and the adviser was also quoted as saying i 
cant believe bush will reappoint him and i dont know a soul in 
the white house who thinks he will 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater denied bush was 
angry with greenspan michael boskin the presidents chief 
economic adviser said there was no foundation for the story which 
he termed out of left field 
however boskin stopped short of endorsing the feds current 
policies and he also refused to say whether he would recommend that 
greenspan be reappointed calling that question premature 
various administration officials have publicly criticized the 
fed over the past several months but the times story was the first 
to suggest bush was so upset that greenspans reappointment was 
unlikely 
at the fed spokeswoman marci schneider said greenspan would 
have no comment on the times story 
but many private economists said they believed the unnamed bush 
adviser was sending a clear warning that greenspan needs to relent 
his tightmoney policies in order to spur economic growth which 
dipped in the last quarter to its most sluggish pace in more than 
three years 
the administration thinks that greenspan is screwing up the 
economy they believe that if only greenspan would lower interest 
rates we would have faster growth a lower budget deficit and 
everybody would be better off said michael evans head of a 
washington forecasting firm 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker greenspans 
predecessor was the target of similar barbed comments in 1983 when 
his first term as chairman was expiring 
you never know on these whether they are trial balloons from 
some disgruntled element in the administration that wants to get 
rid of greenspan or whether bush is really mad said david wyss 
chief financial economist at drimcgraw hill i remember a lot of 
similar stories right about the time reagan reappointed volcker 
but other analysts said reagan was forced to reappoint volcker 
in 1983 because jittery financial markets had a lot of faith in 
volckers ability to manage the economy they said greenspan may 
not command the same amount of respect 
us financial markets seemed to ignore the entire flap on 
friday preferring to focus instead on the unemployment report 
which showed the jobless rate holding steady at 53 percent as job 
growth registered its biggest gain in 20 months 
analysts said the job growth supported greenspans current view 
that the danger point for a recession has passed and the economy 
should exhibit a modest rebound in coming months 
why would you lower interest rates when the economy seems to 
be pushing ahead you would just be running grave risks of making 
inflation worse said robert dederick chief economist of northern 
trust co of chicago

unemployment held at 53 percent in february 
while the economy produced the most jobs in nearly two years and 
factory payrolls swelled for the first time in 11 months the 
government said friday 
private economists and the bush administration said the report 
was fresh evidence that the economy is rebounding from its anemic 
09 percent growth rate in the final three months of last year as 
measured by the gross national product 
we believe the economy after a period of slower growth is 
likely to show progress in 1990 said michael boskin president 
bushs chief economic adviser 
he noted that the unemployment rate for black americans 105 
percent was the lowest since august 1974 
a labor department survey of households showed a seasonally 
adjusted civilian jobless rate of 53 percent the ninth 
consecutive month at that level the rate has ranged between 5 
percent and 55 percent since mid1988 and is in the lowest range 
since the early 1970s 
a separate survey of employers showed a nonfarm job gain of 
372000 the largest since june 1988 the department revised its 
figure for january to an increase of 332000 up from an earlier 
estimate of 275000 
manufacturers added 90000 workers the first increase since 
march 1989 
however labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood 
cautioned that february gains were inflated by temporary factors 
all of the increase at factories was attributed to the return of 
temporarily laid off auto workers other types of manufacturing 
were sluggish also construction payrolls grew by 60000 
employees the result of unusually mild weather in february she 
told congress joint economic committee 
economist rudy oswald of the aflcio warned that the strong 
dollar by increasing the price of us goods on overseas markets 
will dampen prospects for much improvement in manufacturing 
payrolls which are down 199000 from a year earlier 
layoffs by wall street brokerage houses and job losses at other 
service firms such as atampt and ibm havent been reflected yet in 
government reports he said 
nevertheless most private economists who as recently as two 
months ago were expecting a recession this year said the economy 
is beginning 1990 with more vigor than anticipated 
right now the recession fear has been pretty well put on the 
back burner said economist robert g dederick of northern trust 
co in chicago this is an economy which unless its hit over 
the head just keeps going 
stock and bond prices both turned down after the report brokers 
said it seemed to dim whatever chances might have existed for any 
decline in interest rates from the federal reserve 
the central bank has been keeping interest rates relatively high 
in order to slow the economy and curb inflation pressures it began 
nudging rates down last june after signs of an impending recession 
emerged 
however its left monetary policy unchanged since december and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan indicated in recent 
congressional testimony that central bank policymakers have once 
again focused policy on dampening inflation 
its hard for me to see why they would ease in the near 
future said economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill a 
lexington mass forecasting firm were going to see the fed 
holding monetary policy stable in the next few weeks 
overall total civilian employment edged up to 118 million the 
jobless numbered 66 million about the same as january 
the service sector of the economy added 22100 jobs including a 
gain of 47000 for health services 28000 in government 17000 in 
retail trade and 15000 in finance real estate and insurance 
the addition of about 20000 census workers over the past two 
months is bolstering the government number and several hundred 
thousand additional workers will be added in the next few months 
norwood said 
in other details the department said average hourly earnings 
posted a 06 percent rise in february to 987 up from 952 a 
year earlier 
also the average manufacturing work week held steady in 
february at 407 hours overtime fell slightly from 37 hours to 
36 hours 
the unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month 
were 
adult white men 41 percent up from 4 percent in january 
adult white women 41 percent up from 4 percent 
white teenagers 130 percent up from 127 percent 
all blacks 105 percent down from 113 percent 
adult black men 92 percent down from 112 percent 
adult black women 94 percent up from 92 percent 
black teenagers 28 percent up from 267 percent 
hispanics 78 percent up from 71 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the february 
jobless rate was 52 percent the same as january

the dollar moved mostly higher friday in quiet 
trading on world currency markets bolstered by a 
betterthanexpected us employment report 
gold prices slipped worldwide on the new york commodity 
exchange gold settled at 39980 a troy ounce off 20 cents from 
thursday republic national bank of new york later quoted a bid of 
39975 a troy ounce down 5 cents 
the dollar got a boost from a us labor department report 
showing nonfarm payrolls gained 372000 jobs in february the 
largest increase since june 1988 most estimates had called for a 
gain of roughly 250000 jobs 
the data gave the dollar good background support said marc 
chandler an analyst at mms international in chicago the numbers 
gave greater credence to the softlanding scenario and reduced 
lingering hopes of a nearterm easing of interest rates he said 
the federal reserve keeps the economy from overheating by 
keeping official interest rates at current levels or by raising 
them as some analysts have suggested the government might be 
considering higher interest rates enhance the value of 
dollardenominated securities 
despite the bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar chandler 
noted that the fear of central bank intervention prevented the 
currency from rising further several central banks stepped in to 
sell dollars in european trading but they did not follow through 
in domestic markets 
because of nagging political and economic problems in britain 
analysts predicted the pound would continue to weaken against the 
dollar 
the pound lost nearly 25 cents amid anxiety over recent 
demonstrations against a new tax imposed by city halls across 
britain in addition opinion polls show the popularity of the 
conservative government and of prime minister margaret thatcher is 
at an alltime low as inflation rises and interest rates remain 
high 
earlier in tokyo the dollar rose to 15115 japanese yen from 
thursdays 15083 yen later in london the dollar closed at 15132

aftershocks from president bushs savings and 
loan bailout are rippling across the financial and political 
landscapes touching for better or worse millions of americans 
taxpayers are hurting even if they dont know it money spent 
on savings institutions wont be available for education the drug 
war and other worthy purposes 
in its first six months the new bailout agency the resolution 
trust corp has spent 24 billion and thats just a down payment 
sophisticated savers who put their money in shaky sampls paying 
high interest rates are hurting too an infusion of government 
money into sampls has pulled those rates down 
others are benefiting however a booming new scavenger industry 
is rising from the ashes of the savings and loans 
although the rtc aims at a payroll of 4800 people by the end of 
the year up from 2300 now most of its work will be performed by 
private contractors 
more than 10000 accountants lawyers real estate brokers 
appraisers and property managers have queried the rtc and are 
waiting eagerly for the spring when the agency begins awarding an 
estimated 15 billion worth of contracts 
the pickings are particularly juicy for lawyers the rtc already 
is involved in 40000 lawsuits inherited from its bureaucratic 
predecessors or the sampls its taking over 
according to rtc chairman l william seidman that likely will 
double requiring help from 500 outside law firms 
commercial banks are beneficiaries of the bill as well in the 
vast majority of government thrift deals to date banks have been 
the buyers expanding their retail branch networks 
also as sampls make fewer loans banks have moved to replace 
them in the third quarter of last year residential mortgage 
lending at banks surpassed sampl mortgage lending for the first time 
banks had 38 percent of the market compared with 35 percent for 
thrift associations 
both banks and sampls but not savers are being helped by a 
program to reduce deposit rates paid by the institutions under 
government control the rtc has replaced 92 billion in highcost 
deposits with government money and expects to spend another 3 
billion in march 
as a result pressure has eased on healthy sampls and banks once 
forced to offer high rates to compete against insolvent but open 
institutions according to an office of thrift supervision study 
meanwhile developers complain that one provision of the 
legislation is having the unintended effect of choking off credit 
for worthy projects the law sharply reduced the maximum loan an 
institution can make to a single lender from 100 percent of net 
worth to 15 percent 
it was intended to force thrifts to diversify their risks but 
builders say even good loans arent being made 
the culprits of the crisis both politicians and sampl executives 
also are beginning to suffer 
the rtc has referred 1200 cases of suspected fraud to the 
justice department in texas alone 500 individuals are targeted 
for investigation according to mark m richard deputy assistant 
attorney general 
meanwhile five senators who intervened with regulators on 
behalf of millionaire charles h keating jrs lincoln savings and 
loan association are sweating through a senate ethics committee 
investigation 
at least one sen alan cranston dcalif the no 2 democrat 
in the senate is fighting for political survival with voters in 
his home state 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee is keeping the heat bipartisan his investigation of the 
lincoln debacle forced top thrift regulator m danny wall a reagan 
administration appointee to announce his resignation 
now he plans to focus on the connections between sampls and 
drexel burnham lambert incs indicted junk bond chief michael 
milken 
among the sampls coming under scrutiny will be silverado banking 
savings and loan association of denver the presidents son neil 
bush served on the failed thrifts board 
the younger bush is fighting conflictofinterest charges 
leveled by the thrift office and the house probe will keep that 
controversy simmering

pan am corp which has been seeking a merger 
partner to pull it out of financial trouble on friday reported a 
fourthquarter net loss of 1783 million 
the loss amounting to 121 a share widened from a net loss of 
517 million or 36 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1988 
revenue during the quarter rose to 69 percent to 8979 million 
from 8399 million a year earlier 
new yorkbased pan am the nations eighthlargest airline said 
its revenue was severely impacted by declining passenger 
traffic on its transatlantic routes 
the airline blamed a 103 percent jump in operating expenses 
largely on soaring fuel prices it said its jet fuel costs rose to 
1747 million in the quarter from 1294 million a year earlier 
pan am has lost around 2 billion since 1981 and is saddled with 
841 million in debt 
a year ago pan am chairman thomas plaskett said the airline 
needed to merge with another carrier in order to survive pan am 
offered about 33 billion last may for nwa inc parent of 
northwest airlines but was outbid by a 365 billion offer from a 
group led by investor alfred checchi 
pan am and the larger northwest have held discussions in recent 
weeks but a source familiar with the talks said they have stalled 
a merger between the two airlines just doesnt make sense 
the source said but he added that some sort of joint marketing 
arrangement between the two still could emerge 
for all of 1989 pan am had a net loss of 3366 million or 
231 a share compared with a loss of 727 million or 51 cents a 
share in 1988 
the 1989 results include a gain of 1105 million from the sale 
of pan am world services a contract subsidiary for security and 
other services the 1988 results included an 891 million gain 
from the sale of delivery positions for airbus jets 
fullyear revenue declined to 356 billion from 357 billion 
in 1988 
despite the severe setback in our 1989 financial performance 
we continued implementing our plans to provide highquality 
customer service plaskett said in a news release friday the 
positive traffic results in recent months are most encouraging and 
serve to support our belief that consumers are recognizing the 
improvements we have made in our service product 
pan am said its passenger traffic in january was up 23 percent 
over the same month last year followed by a 26 percent jump in 
february 
some airline analysts believe that short of merging with 
northwest pan am might sell some of its prized transatlantic 
routes or other assets 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon confirmed this week that the 
airline has held preliminary talks with lufthansa german airlines 
on a possible sale of pan ams internal german service 
last week pan am said it reached agreement with two 
unidentified creditors to defer about 106 million in payments the 
first scheduled repayments are due in this years fourth quarter 
and will extend through the fourth quarter of 1991 
in exchange the airline agreed to pledge additional assets 
including spare parts as collateral

coffee futures tumbled friday on speculation that brazil was 
ready to pour more of its crop on the world market 
on other futures markets soybeans and corn rose while energy 
products gold and pork prices fell 
the march futures contract for coffee dipped to nearly 95 cents 
a pound on the new york coffee sugar and cocoa exchange 
bert ruiz a vice president of balfour maclaine corp said the 
big decline in heavy volume followed an estimate thursday by the 
brazilian coffee agency that it has more than 16 million bags of 
coffee on hand 
thats a lot of coffee but very little of it is the finer 
exportable type said ruiz 
it was apparently enough to scare traders who also felt coffee 
futures rose too much earlier this week when it went to over 105 
a pound he said 
coffee settled 425 cents to 732 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 9518 cents 
futures prices for soybeans and corn advanced but wheat was 
mostly lower on the chicago board of trade 
a resurgence of export business and an active soymeal cash 
market overnight in rotterdam supported soybean futures said joel 
karlin an analyst with research department inc 
also south american rains could delay the start of the 
harvest there he said the soybean advance spilled over into 
corn and gave that market a boost 
wheat prices were depressed by forecasts of rain this weekend 
over us growing areas said walter spilka analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 383 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cent 
higher with march at 243 a bushel oats were cent to 2 cents 
higher with march at 146 a bushel and soybeans were 3 cent to 
6 cents higher with march at 587 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange pork futures were lower and 
cattle prices mostly higher 
buying interest in cattle was generated by active feeder cattle 
sales at higher prices and expectations for higher feeder prices 
next week analysts said 
pork prices were weakened by anticipation that many farmers who 
have spent the past week at home because of bad weather will be 
out marketing their animals on monday according to traders 
cattle settled unchanged to 35 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in april at 7762 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
05 cent lower to 40 cent higher with march at 8210 cents a 
pound live hogs were 15 cent to 30 cent lower with april at 
5192 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 100 cent to 143 
cent lower with march at 5095 cents a pound 
precious metals declined on the commodity exchange in new york 
gold was pressured by the us dollar firming against foreign 
currencies and lowerthanexpected february unemployment data 
analysts said the dollar and unemployment data usually move in 
opposite directions from gold 
gold settled 20 cents to 50 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 39980 a troy ounce and silver was 1 cent to 
2 cent lower with march at 510 a troy ounce 
energy products futures sank on the new york mercantile exchange 
peter beutel of elders futures inc said light refiner buying 
interest weighed on futures prices 
crude oil settled 23 cents to 35 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in april at 2043 a barrel heating oil was 142 
cents to 170 cents lower with april at 5386 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gasoline was 75 cent to 174 cents lower with april at

bond prices fell sharply friday knocked down by 
news of strong employment growth in february 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond tumbled point or 
750 for every 1000 in face value its yield which rises when 
the price falls surged to 862 percent from 855 percent late 
thursday 
analysts attributed the markets weakness to a labor department 
report showing nonfarm payrolls expanded in february by the 
largest amount in 20 months 
after the report was released in the morning it was put your 
helmet on and get in the foxhole said john sebastian executive 
vice president of clayton brown amp associates in chicago 
the seasonally adjusted gain of 372000 jobs was the largest 
since june 1988 in another sign of strength in the labor market 
the department revised the nonfarm payroll gain for january to 
332000 up from an earlier estimate of 275000 the overall 
unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent 
these numbers show an economy thats considerably stronger 
than some would have thought said william brachfeld an 
executive vice president at daiwa securities inc in new york 
that interpretation reinforced the widely held perception that 
the federal reserve has insufficient cause to pursue a more 
generous credit policy and push interest rates lower 
in fact brachfeld said some traders now have begun to ask 
whether the fed might be more inclined sometime in the near future 
to tighten its grip on credit in a steppedup effort to squeeze 
inflation out of the economy

the boeing co issued layoff notices to about 600 
workers friday roughly a third as many as anticipated nearly two 
months ago but a company spokesman said employment forecasts for 
the year remain unchanged 
about threefourths of the twoweek notices were for workers at 
the 767 and 747 plant in verett with the remainder scattered 
around the rest of the puget sound area paul binder said friday 
in january boeing said it expected to cut its seattlearea work 
force by 5000 people in 1990 but hoped that half those lost jobs 
could be absorbed through retirements or resignations the company 
said it anticipated laying off 1700 hourly workers by april and 
another 800 later in the year 
binder said the overall forecast for the reduced work force 
with about half the reductions accomplished through layoffs 
remained unchanged 
he said he did not know the reason for the apparent delay in 
layoffs but added that 200 to 300 more employees would get pink 
slips in about two weeks and another 200 or so about a week and a 
half after that 
under federal law boeing was required to give 60day notice to 
all workers who could be affected by the layoffs binder said the 
twoweek notices are a more definite indication that workers will 
lose their jobs but even if they do get the notice they 
still might not be laid off 
about 1400 of those facing layoffs are in everett boeing has 
been trying to reassign as many of the workers as it can to other 
plants and has set up centers to help them find new employment 
binder said that in the time since the initial notices were 
issued more people may have retired or taken other jobs 
especially those who knew their jobs were threatened 
in wichita kan boeings secondlargest employment center 91 
workers have been laid off since january and as many as 100 more 
may get pink slips by the end of the month said pete dakan of 
boeing military airplane group 
boeing employment in wichita has been reduced from about 24000 
people to about 23500 so far this year dakan said 
he added that more layoffs in wichita which are separate from 
those announced by binder may be announced early next week 
boeing employed about 106700 people in the seattle area at the 
end of 1989 and employment has since shrunk by about 800 binder 
said worldwide boeing employs about 163000 
the layoff notices come at a time when boeing has a record firm 
backlog of more than 1700 commercial jets with the everett plant 
alone booked through 1996 
boeing hired about 10000 additional employees last year and was 
so strapped for production workers that at one point it borrowed 
600 employees from the lockheed plant in marietta ga mandatory 
overtime was a major issue in the 48day machinists union strike 
against boeing last fall 
last year boeing fell behind schedule in introducing and 
certifying the new 747400 jumbo jet which was brought out in four 
different versions now with startup and certification work done 
company officials say the extra 747 workers no longer are needed 
boeing said earlier it had hoped to absorb those workers in 
defense contracts such as work on the b2 stealth bomber for which 
it is a major subcontractor to northrop but warming eastwest 
relations and the fall of communist regimes in eastern europe have 
cast doubt on the future of many military projects

the securities and exchange commission the 
bastion of law and order on wall street is forming an advisory 
committee to help soviet bloc countries keep their infant stock 
markets orderly and honest 
but securities and soviet economic experts in this country are 
divided over whether its too soon for emerging eastern european 
economies to launch the hunt for red investor 
they want to run before they can walk said ed a hewett a 
senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington 
he and other experts on eastern european economic affairs said 
developing a banking system might be a better course of action 
but they agreed it was important for the us government to take 
the initiative in guiding the way to capitalism despite market 
drops and junk bond scandals 
whatever our problems are theirs are greater said marshall 
i goldman associate director of harvards russian research 
center adding i think the last thing they want is a series 
of drexel burnham lamberts popping up 
last tuesday sec chairman richard c breeden who has met 
recently with highlevel financial officials from the soviet union 
hungary and poland announced that the sec is forming an advisory 
committee on emerging securities markets in eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
obviously they need a banking system breeden said in a 
telephone interview late friday but i disagree that you should 
do nothing but focus on banks and ignore the development of a 
capital market 
he said bank loans alone could create a greater dependency on 
debt financing than might be desired if we can also create equity 
markets 
breeden said the soviet delegation sought his advice during a 
visit that included a tour of the new york stock exchange and major 
securities firms 
they said equity was something they would like to move 
toward he said they obviously are not going to go from zero 
to the new york stock exchange in the next six months but they are 
looking for systems with low volume that can be expanded 
but a source familiar with developments leading up to the 
formation of the sec comittee said the idea grew out of the malta 
summit meeting between president bush and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
administration officials saw the creation of stock markets in 
the formerly communistdominated countries as symbolic of 
democracy said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
despite the frenzy over newly won political freedoms however 
experts contacted this week said eastern europe may not be quite 
ready to shift from das kapital to venture capital 
the first step is not going for a sophisticated stock 
market said stuart brown an assistant professor of economics at 
georgetown university 
most experts thought it was a great idea for the sec to be 
involved at such an early stage but questioned how ready moscow 
and warsaw were for leveraged buyouts and real estate investment 
trusts 
their questions are not about junk bonds but what is a 
stock what is a bond how do we move money around said hewett 
the securities markets are really only a small part of the 
economic system said alan bromberg a securities law professor 
at southern methodist university my guess is they must first 
have a banking system that will provide seed money for private 
enterprise 
if the federal reserve board has any plans for eastern europe 
the nations top economic policymaking body is keeping them close 
to the vest 
the central bank said in a statement friday in the course of 
our ongoing relationship with officials of foreign economies it is 
not uncommon for them to visit fellow officials of the federal 
reserve and in recent months these visits have included officials 
from some east european countries 
the advisory committee which may meet as soon as next month 
will recommend what action the sec and the financial industry can 
take to help create organize securities markets in eastern europe 
said breeden 
i hope they have somebody in there who knows something about 
the soviet union said goldman there can be a real danger to 
thinking it operates like a normal economy 
because of official corruption oppressive laws and a huge black 
market the soviet union is a crimeridden society that needs 
advice on regulations he said 
breeden said there was no more fitting manner for this country 
to help economic development in eastern europe than by assisting 
in the creation of free capital markets in these countries 
but some critics have noted that a system that has seen a stock 
market crash a steep drop in the junk bond market and the collapse 
of drexel burnham lambert inc the securities firm that pioneered 
the highyield highrisk bonds may not be the best example to 
emulate 
i think just the opposite countered arthur mathews a 
prominent washington securities attorney dont you think the 
fact that our markets could survive a crash and the collapse of 
drexel without a depression shows their strength

two drugs used to treat heart attacks save lives 
equally well despite a 10fold difference in their cost according 
to research announced thursday 
the risk of dying before leaving the hospital was the same no 
matter whether the patient was treated with streptokinase or tissue 
plasminogen activator called tpa 
when each drug was combined with a second drug called heparin 
streptokinase showed a lower death rate 
but an official of genentech inc the major biotechnology 
company that makes tpa the more expensive drug said he believes 
the study was not the final answer for american doctors 
the results released at a medical conference in florence 
italy dealt with more than 20000 european heart attack patients 
the researchers were from italy and elsewhere in europe 
the study found an overall death rate of 89 percent after 
treatment with tpa and an 85 percent rate after treatment with 
streptokinase statistically those rates are the same 
both drugs are designed to destroy blood clots that have caused 
heart attacks by blocking a crucial blood vessel 
genentechs tpa holds about twothirds of the market while 
streptokinase has about a third genentech reported tpa sales of 
197 million in 1989 
but their costs vary greatly an editorial in the new england 
journal of medicine last year said one treatment with streptokinase 
costs 78 at a san francisco hospital while tpa costs 2268 a 
separate report has cited a 10fold difference 
the new england journal editorial accompanied a study that 
suggested the two drugs worked equally well but it looked at the 
health of the hearts main pumping chamber rather than death rates 
the newly announced study bears out what a number of 
cardiologists have been really saying for the last four or five 
years that there has been absolutely no scientific evidence that 
tpa was superior to streptokinase said an american investigator 
familiar with the results william oneill of william beaumont 
hospital in royal oak mich 
but david stump director of clinical research for genentech 
said the trials treatment procedure hampered the effectiveness of 
tpa 
patients did not receive early intravenous doses of heparin 
along with tpa therapy he said many american doctors take that 
step to keep opened arteries from becoming obstructed again he 
said 
the heparin given some patients in the study was administered 
much later in the course of therapy and through injections under 
the skin rather than intravenously he said in a telephone 
interview from florence 
the combination of tpa plus heparin in the new study gave a 
death rate of 92 percent and streptokinase plus heparin yielded a 
79 percent rate 
g kirk raab president and chief executive officer of 
genentech called for further tests of patients who got early 
intravenous injections of heparin 
the study wont affect a planned merger between genentech and 
roche holding ltd the swiss pharmaceutical giant that was 
announced last month according to a roche news release 
individual trials limited to certain aspects only would not 
influence such important investment decisions roche said 
the study also found the risk of stroke was greater in patients 
treated with tpa the stroke rate was 13 percent among the group 
treated with tpa compared with 1 percent in those treated with 
streptokinase 
these stroke rates are within the 1 percent to 15 percent 
range seen in other studies with thrombolytics antiblood cloting 
drugs and are within the range seen in heart attack patients not 
receiving thrombolytic therapy genentech said in a statement
