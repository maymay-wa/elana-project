nation of islam leader louis 
farrakhan told a university audience he owes no apology to his 
jewish critics because jews have sucked the blood of the black 
community 
farrakhan spoke to about 4000 people sunday at michigan state 
university as jewish students and others protested outside 
the black muslim minister who has provoked controversy with 
previous remarks about jews said jews historically have exploited 
and mistreated blacks he said he owes no apology to jewish critics 
for his frequent attacks on jews 
you sucked the blood of the black community farrakhan said 
about 200 protesters held a candlelight vigil before the speech 
and others held a rally against racism earlier sunday 
he is a hatemonger as far as we are concerned said 
protester mark finkelstein executive director of the hillel jewish 
student center we stand united against bigotry 
farrakhan told the predominantly black audience that blacks were 
demeaned in the movies he saw as a youngster he blamed jews in the 
film industry 
you wrote us in as clowns and buffoons farrakhan said i 
never did that to you but you jews did that to black people 
security for the speech included police dogs sniffing the 
auditorium and public safety officers scanning ticketholders with 
metal detectors the searches delayed the speech for about an hour

salvage crews have cut apart the last of 
34 barges lodged at a dam since a new years day accident that 
halted monongahela river traffic 
the towing companies that owned the wayward vessels moved the 
last barges from the maxwell dam 30 miles south of pittsburgh on 
sunday many of them were cut apart and scrapped because of damage 
army corps of engineers spokesman john reed said 
three other barges sank and will not be recovered reed said 
a 24mile stretch of the river was closed for 17 days about a 
week after 62 barges broke loose during high water and crashed 
downstream thirtyfour of the barges ended up behind the maxwell 
dam 
one barge leaked 10000 gallons of gasoline into the river

the tough norwegians of the north can 
ride out the savage storms the isolation and the winter darkness 
that lasts for two months it is the regions shattered economy 
that is forcing many to leave 
most people very strongly want to stay here i cant explain 
it its hard to make the people of south norway understand much 
less foreigners said vigor rossvaer a university of tromsoe 
researcher 
for unemployed fisherman vidar esbensen the answer is simple 
this is home 
the norwegian arctic is vast sparsely populated and beautiful 
with snowcapped mountains sloping down into the fjords and the 
northern lights staging nightly shows but gorgeous scenery doesnt 
pay the mortgage 
unemployment alcoholism and the death rate have long been 
higher than the norwegian average then in january codfish quotas 
were slashed to protect declining barents sea stocks putting a 
chokehold on the regions main income 
you cant live on the quota and you dont quite die from it 
either said esbensen 35 who was thrown out of work when the 
cod quota was cut from 350000 to 130000 tons 
earlier this month the government offered a 500 million kroner 
77 million bailout package mainly interest relief on state 
loans to tide fishermen over while longterm solutions are sought 
disappointed fishermen called the package a bandaid on a 
bullet wound and threatened strikes 
in the northernmost province of finnmark unemployment is 77 
percent compared to 39 percent in oslo norways capital the 
county population has been falling for 40 years and dropped by 68 
percent in the past decade to 75000 
a survey of those who left indicated that 516 percent sought 
better jobs or schools while 227 percent said they were driven 
off by bad weather and the depressing 24hour winter nights 
rossvaer said the north is a victim of ecology economy and even 
world politics international pressure forced an end to whale 
hunting an important industry 
improving relations with the soviet union is both menacing and 
encouraging especially in finnmark which curls eastward as if on 
a mapmakers whim over northern sweden and finland to butt against 
the soviet union along a 122mile border 
some residents fear a scaling back of the permanent military 
presence and periodic nato maneuvers which brought airports bus 
services roads and employment to the north on the other hand an 
open soviet border could mean income from trade and tourism 
business analyst sven oppegaard predicts a reconstruction of the 
regions economic and social base scattered hamlets where 
residents catch and process their own fish will give way to 
larger more efficient centers he says 
some fishing stations already are abandoned 
we cant have a tiny village with a church school and fish 
factory on every little point of land said oppegaard of the 
norwegian confederation of business and industry 
the military disagrees residents in villages dotting the long 
jagged coast report on soviet naval activity said gunnar 
angeltveit of the defense ministry 
modern pressures are building up in this onceisolated 
tightlyknit coastal society which may account for the 73 percent 
increase in suicides from 1975 to 1985 and rising alcohol abuse 
said rossvaer 
there is a conflict of two cultures one is modern norway 
with its attractions and the other is the traditional coastal 
culture he said 
northerners are friendly open imaginative and sometimes 
wishful most villages even those seldom visited have a local 
polar museum adorned with relics of seal and whale hunts 
locals scratching for opportunities see tourism as a way to help 
preserve fading ways of life whale hunting with cameras reindeer 
rides and dogsled treks one suggested selling tourists neckties 
made from salmon skins 
we will do whatever we can to hang on said esbensen its 
hard in the barents especially in storms but there is a freedom 
out there ive tried working on land i couldnt take it 
not everyone can stick it out two years after its 
fishprocessing plant closed the village of bugoeynes won national 
attention with an advertisement seeking a new home in the south 
anywhere with jobs and room for all 300 villagers 
we dont really want to leave this is a cry for help one 
villager admitted 
theyre a symbol of a people trying to keep their society 
intact even if it means moving south together said rossvaer

sheep now feed off grass and overgrown 
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to 
seal off albania today the fight against the worlds corrupting 
effects takes a different form 
western culture although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and 
intellectuals seeps through the increasingly porous borders of 
europes most isolated nation 
western ideas contrast sharply with albanian orthodoxy but there 
is little open evidence of any grassroots disaffection threatening 
to topple the last european refuge of stalinism 
reports of anticommunist riots in the northern city of skhoder 
in january apparently were unfounded officials here charge they 
were fabricated by the statecontrolled media in yugoslavia which 
is at odds with albania over the fate of millions of ethnic 
albanians in the yugoslav province of kosovo 
we do not want to assimilate we want to preserve our national 
identity said ymer minxhozi general secretary of the albanian 
union of journalists 
we have no homosexuality no prostitution no drugs and no 
black market he told a group of visiting western journalists 
the bunkers first built during world war ii to guard against a 
land invasion were vastly expanded after the sovietled warsaw 
pact marched into czechoslovakia in 1968 now they are falling into 
disuse 
no one knows exactly how many bunkers there are but one 
official estimated at least one for every albanian 3 million 
the bunkers in albania do not move they have no feet or 
wheels they do not threaten anyone deputy foreign minister 
socrat placa said in an interview 
during its 45year history as a stalinist state albania has had 
little to do with the world beyond its borders it still reveres 
the memory of josef stalin and adheres strictly to marxistleninist 
doctrine 
albania cut ties with the soviet union in 1961 because of its 
destalinization program and with china in 1978 because of chinas 
perceived deviation from marxistleninist policies after mao 
tsetungs death 
enver hoxha the founder of the communist state in albania died 
in 1985 but his policies and personality cult survive a hoxha 
museum opened last year a marble and glass temple among tiranas 
dilapidated and windowless buildings 
hoxhas successor ramiz alia is credited with introducing some 
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the albanian 
system mistrust and hostility toward moscow and washington remain 
however 
placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard 
a western news report on a visiting reporters radio of an 
explosion at a soviet military base in czechoslovakia 
good good very good of course it may have some 
consequences but is a good lesson for gorbachev placa said 
nevertheless placa said discussions were under way to further 
increase ties with both east and west 
albanians are able to view italian yugoslavian and greek 
television scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in tirana 
were the words iron maiden a leading british heavyrock band 
in another part of town someone had repeatedly written liri 
freedom on a kiosk wall an uncommon slogan in a country with a 
powerful secret police the sigurimi 
activities of the sigurimi were assailed last year however in 
a bestselling novel by writer neshat tozaj who works as a 
criminal investigator in the ministry of internal affairs 
the novel thikat knives portrayed the sigurimi as 
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions 
publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could 
indicate a relaxation of censorship or as some western observers 
suggested a power struggle to restrict the sigurimi 
the artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it 
touched on certain themes in our society life must be 
reflected in literature said nasi lera secretary of the 
albanian union of artists and writers 
authorities still want to stop controversial material about 
albania from reaching abroad 
visiting finnish television journalists found on their return 
home evidence of tampering with an interview with foreign minister 
reiz malile which had been filmed by a local crew 
malile had acknowledged on camera that albania had some 
political prisoners but added its not a problem that section 
of tape was replaced by a segment of an albanian song contest 
modern western literature is translated into albanian and 
william faulkner ernest hemingway saul bellow and truman capote 
are better known than spanish italian or french writers said 
ismail kadare albanias bestknown modern author 
we dont approve of pornography and our greatest problem 
is mediocrity but thats a worldwide problem kadare added in an 
interview 
the west definitely has a corrupting influence even though 
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements 
and progress a 21yearold woman said 
she added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange 
program then said but things are so good here

the oil spill that fouled californias coast 
brought scenes of work gangs with towels and pads swabbing gooey 
beaches using methods industry called stateoftheart but 
environmentalists panned as primitive 
were watching a very crude burlesque show which unfortunately 
cannot get the job done said bob sulnick head of american 
oceans campaign a santa monicabased environmental group 
this spill unequivocally demonstrates you really cant clean 
up an oil spill 
oil company officials said the industry is doing the best it 
can and plans a multimilliondollar effort to develop better 
cleanup methods 
rather than dwell on the shortcomings of the stateoftheart 
as they now exist id try to look to the future american 
petroleum institute spokesman bill taylor said by phone from 
washington 
on feb 7 the tanker american trader spilled 400000 gallons of 
british petroleum america inc oil off huntington beach polluting 
some 14 miles of southern california coastline killing scores of 
birds and ruining business for local fishermen 
the coast guard estimated last week that skimming boats cleaned 
up more than a third of the oil while nearly half evaporated or 
dissipated in the ocean the rest hit the beach 
bays and wetlands were sealed off with booms and temporary dams 
vacuum trucks helped keep oil from the santa ana river 
unlike last years nearly 11milliongallon exxon valdez spill 
on alaskas rocky beaches highpressure hoses were not used on 
sandy california shores 
but television scenes still were dominated by the spectacle of 
hundreds of yellowsuited cleanup workers raking up the mess and 
dabbing globs of oil using absorbent pompons towels and pads that 
looked like big diapers 
coast guard lt cmdr jack kemerer said he wouldnt call cleanup 
technology primitive but it hasnt changed much in the last 10 
or 15 years 
cleaning the sand with absorbent pads may look primitive but 
i dont think it is kemerer said in this case its probably 
the most effective way to do it without destroying the beach 
using bulldozers to scoop up oily sand 
others were harsher in assessing cleanup methods 
politically you have to put on a show by hiring people and 
having them mop up whatever oil they can mop up sulnick said 
but people ought not to believe thats a cleanup this oil will 
be in the environment for a decade 
a spokesman for british petroleum defended the cleanup 
this cleanup used the best technology thats available 
even though the technology seems primitive and very very labor 
intensive said tom thomson 
he said officials must consider possible environmental damage 
from cleanup methods which is why toxic chemical dispersants were 
not used on the nearshore spill 
kemerer executive officer of the pacific area strike team that 
responds to oil and toxic spills said the oil industry and 
government have not spent enough money on research and development 
of new cleanup methods 
im sure on the government side it was budgetary 
constraints he said there probably was some complacency 
there werent any big spills for some time 
since the exxon valdez spill the oil companies are forming a 
petroleum industry response organization that will spend 
millions to study and develop better methods to recover spilled oil 
and prevent and reduce harm to shorelines taylor said 
the effort will seek improvements in oileating bacteria 
methods to wash oil off land boom designs absorbent materials 
oilcoagulating gels and oil disposal techniques he added 
thomson said that safety is clearly a topofthemind issue in 
the industry and cleanup methods will improve 
but the oil company spokesman added the unfortunate part of 
it is that technology gets developed as a result of crises like the 
exxon valdez disaster and the american trader disaster 
ann notthoff of the natural resources defense councils san 
francisco office said she is waiting for some results 
both the federal government and the oil companies havent 
taken the risk of spills seriously she said 
they clearly have not invested in prevention measures they 
resisted double hull requirements for tankers they havent 
invested much in development of stronger cleanup technology

a western visitor to poland tried to call 
his warsaw office from the airport jan 17 instead of a 
connection he got a closeup look at poland in reform 
pay phone rates quadrupled that day although at five calls per 
penny they were still a bargain to the average westerner that is 
to any westerner who has the right size 20zloty coin and can find 
a phone that works 
in poland like in much of eastern europe doing business comes 
down to overcoming the daily little difficulties 
the airport bank and the bar laughed him off downstairs the 
lady who tended the public toilets obliged with five coins in 
exchange for the remainder of a 500zloty note a nickel tip 
all three phones on the wall were kaput a short hike away in 
the domestic terminal four phones refused to take coins two did 
and would not surrender them 
the visitor wasnt surprised polands directdial system to 
western europe produced fewer successful first attempts than the 
marriott casino awarded jackpots trying to phone new york could 
take all day 
poles often have trouble calling across town 
an option might be the mail but a colleague tried that the same 
day all the post office clerk had to offer were stamps of such 
small denomination that they would cover both sides of a postcard

wilfred lepage saw his first zebra mussel feb 1 by september 
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water 
treatment plant he manages cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly 
sparking a water emergency 
there is no cheap solution to it and theres no real cure to 
the problem said lepage water treatment superintendent in 
monroe mich on lake eries western edge 
at the eastern end of the lake in dunkirk ny the 
greenandyellow striped shellfish first appeared oct 3 and now 
infest a niagara mohawk power corp generating plant decembers 
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they 
quickly settled inside the plant 
they like it where its dimly lit they like it where its 
warm and they dont like a lot of turbulence this place is ideal 
for them said robert c henderson a chemical lab supervisor at 
the plant by july were going to have a massive problem with 
them 
three years after they were introduced to north america and 
after only one year in lake erie zebra mussels have spread 
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to lake 
ontario and along the st lawrence river its an invasion 
scientists say could affect farming fishing and daily life along 
virtually every body of fresh water in north america in the next 
few years 
the mussels are mostly about a halfinch long although they can 
reach 2 inches during their fiveyear lifespans they eat by 
filtering microscopic food particles from the water and love 
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings 
them a steady supply of fresh food 
a mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour said r 
warren flint a scientist with the great lakes program at the state 
university of new yorkbuffalo as a result they will leave water 
cleaner than before from an aesthetic perspective that would 
certainly be a benefit i guess he said 
europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algaechoked ponds 
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed said 
charles oneill with the sea grant program at the state university 
college at brockport 
the mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and 
some kinds of fish including sturgeons and eels flint said but 
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food they 
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the 
billiondollar walleye and bassfishing industry 
and the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline 
farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes 
can expect problems and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because 
of the shells oneill said 
it can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet 
to the water at your tap oneill said its not just an 
environmental problem 
like their distant cousins the blue mussels zebras ought in 
theory to be edible by humans flint said but when canadian 
researchers tried steaming a bunch oneill said what they got 
was a stench that cleared the lab 
the mussels have plagued europe for more than a century and are 
believed to have arrived in north america on a freighter that 
emptied its ballast tanks in lake st clair upstream from lake 
erie in 1986 
scientists are studying the possibility that the lake erie 
infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 
event oneill said but flint said one colony could have infested 
the lake because one mussel can lay 30000 to 50000 eggs a year 
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells 
they could easily get across lake erie or lake ontario in that 
period of time he said 
for public water systems controlling the mussels is a matter of 
applying chlorine ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the 
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the 
plant say scientists and plant operators like lepage who have 
already faced the problem 
power plants have a different problem because officials are

the city of al capone and feisty politics has 
been abuzz for a week over claims by a suspected crime boss that 
the mob bribed local politicans and even helped engineer mayor 
richard m daleys election last year 
cook county republican party chairman james dvorak is at the 
uncomfortable center of the controversy over allegations he was 
paid thousands of mob dollars in bribes he and others hit by the 
tapedrecorded allegations including his onetime boss sheriff 
james ogrady deny the claims 
there also are questions about why federal prosecutors would let 
explosive taped allegations against known officials be played in 
open court with no advance notice little followup and to date 
no criminal charges filed 
the tapes dominated local newscasts and had wide play in 
chicagos two largest daily newspapers the chicago tribune and 
chicago suntimes tribune columnist mike royko though a longtime 
critic of politicians said the feds tactics were unfair 
it seems to me that the federal prosecutors out of fairness 
should do something more than play a tape that causes a media 
uproar then clam up wrote the pulitzer prizewinning 
commentator 
its great fun for the news business and for the political 
enemies of those mentioned on the tape royko wrote but i 
didnt know that the justice department believed in trial by a jury 
of gossip column items 
ira raphaelson acting us attorney declined to comment on the 
tapes release 
the story began with a continuing federal probe into organized 
crime that yielded indictments of 20 people and allegations that 
they used murder other violence and threats to run a gambling 
operation 
us attorney general dick thornburgh jetted in to announce the 
busts in a feb 7 news conference calling the operation one of the 
largest crackdowns ever on organized crime in chicago 
that generated some interest but nothing like the detention 
hearing two days later that sent politicians scrambling to clear 
their names 
at that hearing prosecutors played a secretly recorded 
conversation of rocco infelise a reputed mob gambling boss in 
which he talked about payoffs to officials and about influencing 
the last chicago mayoral race 
in the sept 14 conversation with william jahoda a 
bookieturnedinformant who was wearing a wire infelise said 
he had been making 35000 in monthly payoffs to police and 
officials included he said was 10000 a month to the sheriffs 
office 
i lay out 35000 a month for guys that are away and the 
coppers infelise said on the tape between you and i 10 goes 
to the sheriff 
what do you get for the 10000 he was asked by jahoda 
sheriff never bothers us he replied then weve got a guy 
at the states attorneys office we got another guy downtown 
media reports interpreted guys that are away as jailed mobsters 
and another guy downtown as a federal law enforcement official 
the tape said the payments were made through somebody called 
the bohemian irs agent thomas moriarty said in court that 
jahoda who also is under indictment identified the bohemian as 
dvorak the county gop chairman who had been ogradys top 
assistant 
dvorak denied the allegations a did ogrady if this were 
true i would be in argentina right now not before you dvorak 
said at a news conference 
but the political firing line was established 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan leading contender for 
the democratic gubernatorial nomination called on his gop 
counterpart secretary of state jim edgar to explain his 
relationship to dvorak 
republican steven baer a conservative hoping to upset edgar in 
the march 20 primary chimed in that edgar should get to the bottom 
of the allegations 
an edgar spokesman called hartigan and baer phonies edgar 
then called for dvoraks resignation to preserve the party gov 
james r thompson the states top republican who had backed 
dvoraks rise to the chairmanship agreed 
dvorak who acknowledged federal authorities told him in a 
letter he was the subject of an investigation though not a 
target said hed finish his term it ends in april and he said he 
might seek another one 
infelise also boasted on the tape that his organizaton helped 
daley win election last year by pressuring real estate tycoon 
edward debatolo not to contribute to rival edward vrdolyak a 
former alderman 
raphaelson countered that daley was not a subject of the federal 
investigation and even infelises attorney patrick tuite said 
his clients tape was hot air 
daley had another characterization a bunch of bs 
observers say the case proves an old truth politicians can ill 
afford negative charges even if no wrongdoing is proved or charges 
pressed 
politics like life is not fair said paul green a 
political science professor at governors state university in 
suburban university park who follows the chicago scene legal 
nuances politically are irrelevant

after decades of making people nervous bernt 
murphy just wants to be left alone to pick up the pieces of a life 
misspent in a mental hospital 
he even bought a welcome mat for the group home he shares with 
other retarded men so his neighbors will know they are harmless 
but its received precious little wear 
sometimes murphy can only laugh at the fright he inspires 
we keep seeing this white car at the end of the street by the 
fruit stand he said i think one night i might go knock on the 
window with a flashlight and ask what hes doing 
mildly retarded at birth murphy was 19 when he was arrested in 
1957 on charges he raped and beat a 5yearold girl during 
questioning about that crime police said he confessed to a murder 
two years before of a 23yearold woman murphy had known as a 
student at the utah state training school for the mentally retarded 
he was judged incompetent to stand trial for rape and was never 
charged with the murder his attorneys now claim murphy was a 
convenient suspect who admitted responsibility for the slaying 
under intense pressure from police 
declared insane murphy spent more than three decades at the 
utah state hospital in provo until the utah supreme court ruled in 
1988 that murphy was mentally retarded not insane and ordered a 
plan for releasing him 
last month after spending a year living in quarters on the edge 
of hospital property and holding an outside job he was secretly 
whisked to the duplex in nearby orem he shares it with three other 
s identity and smed a city council meeting to demand his removal 
a spokesman for the neighbors rich persons said their concern 
stems from lack of information about the residents 
no one from the state will step forward and tell us if these 
people are dangerous or not he said if the innuendos are 
correct and they are dangerous why dump them in the middle of 
7000 children 
murphys attorney lisa marcy said she repeatedly has assured 
the neighbors the men arent dangerous how many times do they 
need to hear it she said 
nevertheless the city council voted to require the private 
operators of the group home to obtain a business use permit even 
though the area is zoned residential murphys attorneys say they 
are prepared to file federal complaints to keep t 
the fair housing act that applies to bernt is the same one 
that prevenlacks hispanics or women from being moved out of 
neighborhoods marcy said ohn anderson program specialistthe 
state division of handicapped services scoffs at the idea that 
murphy is a threat to anyone he said the duplex should qualify as 
an apartment program for handicapped adults which normally would 
not require a permit 
i just theyd leave us alone and quit g us murphy the diner 
where he has worked for nearly a year as a dishwasher and janitor 
helping pay for his living expenses 
dressed in a 1950sstyle suit coat for his first formal 
interview with a reporter murphy 52 recalled his amusement at 
seeing 1960s tv footage of himself going to court in handcuffs 
that didnt even look like me he said an assessment echoed 
by his attorney who has seen murphy blossom outside the 
institutional environment hes a different person now marcy 
said the longer he is away from the institution the better he 
gets 
murphy proudly tells of losing several pounds following a 
vigorous walking program prescribed by his doctor and tries to 
avoid salt indeed he looks far younger than his 52 years despite 
chronic back trouble 
murphy arises at 5 am so he can be ready for work by 730 he 
is driven the two miles to and from the diner by a job adviser he 
had been permitted to ride the bus until his neighbors learned his 
identity 
murphy said that one of his first purchases after leaving the 
hospital grounds was a spotted dog he named brittney 
im teaching her to sit and stay he said murphy also 
bought a doghouse and a downfilled blanket to keep brittney warm 
at night 
murphys duplex is staffed by supervisors 24 hours a day and he 
cannot go on unaccompanied outings 
earlier this month murphy dated a woman from a neighboring 
group home they went dancing in matching shirts and likely will do 
so again soon shes a real nice girl he said 
his employer julie rees is pleased with murphys progress but 
disturbed by the friction with his neighbors and the attention it 
received 
i think the accounts of his life have been unfair she said 
if you plaster a persons face all over the television screen 
there will be no place he can live

from completely different 
worlds nelson mandela and president fw de klerk are trying to 
find a common ground between south africas whites and blacks and 
bring peace to their divided country 
despite opposition and threats from opponents and extremists on 
both sides the two men are forming an unlikely alliance in their 
quest to end centuries of racial conflict and replace 
whiteminority rule with a powersharing arrangement 
de klerk head of the party that created apartheid to enforce 
white rule comes from a background of wealth and privilege 
mandela who endured 27 years in prison for fighting whiteminority 
rule lived amid the poor black masses struggling to get an 
education 
mr de klerk and mr mandela have established a relationship 
that could be the key in a society so rigidly divided by race 
politics said the rev jesse jackson after seeing the two men 
in a bold attempt to start negotiations on political reform de 
klerk legalized the african national congress and other black 
opposition groups and released mandela from prison feb 11 
in what promises to be an equally important step the african 
national congress the main antiapartheid group announced from 
its headquarters in zambia on friday that it would send delegates 
for peace talks with de klerk 
many south africans have been deeply impressed by the resolution 
and vision of mandela and de klerk after years of worrying about 
an uncertain future the two men have created hope that the 
countrys divisions can be solved 
in a typical example of the positive white reaction to mandela 
the star newspaper wrote groups supporting him are ecstatic 
believing he has done everything expected of him and more in 
proving his transcending leadership qualities 
jubilant blacks celebrating mandelas release showed a new 
attitude to the white government by chanting viva comrade de 
klerk 
the two men have expressed admiration for each other and 
reportedly have established a personal rapport both appear to be 
strong leaders with intelligence and a dramatic ability to seize 
the initiative 
mandela and de klerk say south africas many ethnic and tribal 
groups must sit down and work out a new future where the rights of 
all are ensured or face the threat of war 
mandela while saying he supports continued armed struggle 
against the apartheid system has stressed the need for compromise 
since his release he has said he is willing to negotiate on 
everything including the longstanding black demand of oneman 
onevote and full democracy 
compromise must be made in respect to every issue as long as 
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population 
group but the country as a whole he said in an interview 
he has repeatedly stressed that whites face no threat in a 
democratic south africa 
de klerk also stresses compromise all of us now have an 
opportunity and the responsibility to prove that we are capable of 
a peaceful process in creating a new south africa he said 
but de klerk and mandela will need far more than good intentions 
to solve the enormous problems confronting south africa the two 
sides are far apart on most major issues 
the governing national party says it opposes majority rule 
because the 5 million whites would be swamped by the 28 million 
blacks government leaders favor a constitution based on group 
rights where the whites would retain some hold on power 
mandela has said economic and social divisions are just as big a 
problem as political inequality south africas wealth is 
concentrated in white hands and most blacks still live in squalid 
townships or barren rural areas struggling to survive 
our people need proper housing not ghettos our people 
need a living wage mandela said 
but while many whites want a political solution there are few 
signs that they are willing to give up their high standards of 
living and accept a major redistribution of wealth 
many whites want to keep segregated neighborhoods schools and 
other facilities but blacks want rapid change and integration 
the two leaders also face opposition from within their own 
ranks black and white hardliners oppose any kind of peaceful 
compromise 
the proapartheid conservative party is attempting to rally 
whites to oust de klerk and force new elections up to 40000 angry 
whites marched in pretoria feb 15 as the conservatives began a 
campaign to halt the governments reforms 
its a complete capitulation when the time comes and they 
want to enforce black communist government on the whites they will 
have to do it by force we wont accept it peacefully said koos 
van der merwe a spokesman for the conservatives 
black opposition groups are also split groups such as the pan 
african congress have used slogans such as one white settler 
one bullet and traditional tribal leaders oppose any settlement 
that would deprive them of power 
de klerk and mandela will have to retain substantial support in 
their respective constitutencies as they begin to make concessions 
at the negotiating table they are likely to need all of their 
strength and skills to retain support and preserve stability in the 
months ahead

the patchedup tanker american trader 
left port sunday for san francisco where it will undergo final 
repairs to a gashed hull that leaked 400000 gallons of oil off 
southern california 
the ship left the port of long beach at about 415 pm after 
inspectors ruled it had been made seaworthy by temporary repairs 
said coast guard petty officer elizabeth neely 
the trip up the coast was expected to take about two days ms 
neely said 
the oil spilled from the gashed hull feb 7 two miles off 
huntington beach as the ships crew maneuvered to unload the 
tankers cargo of crude oil into a submerged pipeline authorities 
said the tanker chartered by british petroleum may have 
collided with its own anchor 
also sunday cleanup experts were trying to decide how to get 
rid of oil coating rock jetties between the newport beach pier and 
the santa ana river along the coast south of los angeles 
theyre talking about using sea water heated to 85 degrees 
which is warm enough to liquefy the petroleum on the rocks but 
wouldnt cook any creatures said newport fire capt ray 
pendleton 
about 300 cleanup workers were on the beaches between huntington 
beach and laguna beach and their numbers may be reduced as the 
project winds down said tony kozlowski a british petroleum 
spokesman 
the spill forced closure of about 15 miles of beaches and two 
harbors and economically hurt charter boat operators whose craft 
are trapped inside the harbors 
the coast guard announced sunday that newport harbor would 
reopen sometime monday ms neely said conditions there improved 
greatly during the weekend 
booms would remain in place at newport harbor but ships could 
pass through a gate that would be installed she said 
there still was no timetable for opening the anaheim bay harbor 
as of sunday the oil had killed 300 birds and covered another 
461 birds in oil state fish and game officials said two of four 
sea lions found soaked in oil have also died

if the masses of human hair turn matted 
and the piles of inmates shoes fall apart museum conservators 
wonder how future generations will know the horror of the auschwitz 
concentration camp 
alarmed by the worsening condition of the barracks gas 
chambers crematoria and archives of victims belongings a team of 
western specialists has volunteered to map out a preservation 
effort that could cost up to 40 million 
the culture ministry of the new noncommunist polish government 
also has formed a commission to change the 35yearold museum 
exhibition which highlights the soviet armys liberation of the 
camp but mentions the holocaust only in passing 
if nothing is done in 10 to 20 years this site will be 
practically nonexistent said frank reiss vice president of the 
new yorkbased ronald s lauder foundation it is falling apart 
it is in urgent need of repair 
the foundation struck an agreement with the governmentrun 
museum to provide technical advice and raise funds for the 
preservation it sent a team of experts including the chief 
conservator from new yorks metropolitan museum of art to assess 
the damage in december 
the tens of thousands of pairs of shoes if you touch 
them they fall to dust reiss said the ruins of the gas 
chambers they have to be preserved but as ruins not put back 
together hollywood style 
nazi germany built the auschwitz concentration camp and the 
adjacent birkenau death camp in southern poland to carry out adolf 
hitlers final solution estimates of the number of people 
killed there range to 4 million mostly jews from across europe 
victims also included gypsies homosexuals and political prisoners 
partly demolished as the red army approached auschwitz was 
liberated on jan 27 1945 the camp remains much as it was left 
the sign reading in german work makes you free above the gates 
the train tracks bisecting the vast expanse of birkenau and ending 
feet from its destroyed crematoria 
inside a brick barracks at auschwitz is a museum exhibit opened 
in the mid1950s the masses of hair piles of shoes and mounds of 
eyeglasses artificial limbs suitcases and baby clothes give the 
human toll a vivid dimension 
the museum staff headed by former inmate kazimierz smolen has 
struggled with the beautifying effect of evergrowing grass the 
soothing sound of birds singing and the governments limited 
resources to maintain the camps hellish authenticity 
it is left largely to the silent testimony of the names on the 
suitcases and a separate lessvisited exhibit supported by foreign 
jewish groups to remind visitors that the camp existed mainly to 
exterminate jews 
the site is officially known as a monument to the martyrdom of 
the polish and other nations the official guidebook describes 
the concentration camps as the main nazi weapon against conquered 
people mainly slavs above all the polish nation and the peoples 
of the ussr as well as jews and other persons considered to be 
such 
polands new government is ready to tackle such sensitive 
issues prosolidarity culture minister izabella cywinska has named 
an independent auschwitz commission including museum experts and 
religious experts 
the commission is to see whether the exhibition fully reflects 
the historical truth and whether it speaks to younger 
generations said krystyna marszalekmlynczyk the vice minister 
leading the panel 
commissioners found many problems with the exhibit commentary on 
a recent inspection 
there is a phrase all poles spontaneously helped jews 
every word of this phrase could be questioned said francisiek 
cemka head of the department of museums 
it was not all and it was not always spontaneous they were 
under the threat of death so one was more bold one was less he 
said 
reiss said the foundation wants the preservation effort to 
ensure that the real story be told that at birkenau 95 percent 
or more of the prisoners killed were jews 
the polish and international teams also face difficult 
conservation problems such as how to preserve barracks built by 
inmate laborers 
we cannot just replace the barracks with new timber or 
strengthen the roofs with concrete as they will tell us later that 
we have falsified it all ms marszalekmlynczyk said 
pollution and a rainy climate also make things worse smolen 
said 
still there is no imminent danger to the artifacts the museum 
director said his staff of 175 already has a preservation program 
in place though with limited funds the museum had a 1989 
conservation budget of about 35000 
with as many as 10000 visitors coming daily to the museum the 
commission also plans to work with the surrounding town on 
developing accommodations including the interfaith prayer center 
to house nuns whose convent on the camp perimeter led to a dispute 
with jewish groups 
i hate to be pragmatic about these things but auschwitz is a 
no 1 tourist attraction in poland reiss said

us experts on eastern europe admit they were 
caught napping by the speed of the move toward german 
reunification and many say mikhail s gorbachevs unpredictable 
moves are what took them by surprise 
whom has he not surprised asked yale historian henry ashby 
turner author of the two germanies since 1945 
i was in east germany last summer i confess and i said 10 
years at that point before east and west germany could be 
unified turner said 
it was hard for all of the experts to conclude that gorbachev 
was willing to dismantle the soviet empire said kim holmes 
director of foreign policy and defense studies for the conservative 
heritage foundation we had to make that leap 
former sen charles mcc mathias rmd president of the 
american council on germany said the world at large has been 
surprised at the speed with which it has gone because there were 
substantial obstacles that could have been expected to slow it 
down and they have simply just collapsed 
among those obstacles said mathias were the assumption that 
the russians would never agree to it the concern that western 
europe thought it might feel about an enlarged germany the 
economic consequences that people foresaw 
but those obstacles were not as formidable as was previously 
thought he said adding that there was no question that 
gorbachev was a major factor 
michael geyer germanborn historian at the university of 
chicago said the soviet leaders support of moves leading toward 
reunification did come as a surprise and so far i have seen no 
good interpretation of what hes doing 
james a smith a historian who has written a book on think 
tanks and is an acknowledged expert on the experts says gorbachev 
may be part of what took them by surprise 
however smith said much of it is that the pace of change has 
simply outstripped the assumptions of the past 40 years 
in addition smith suggested that developments such as facsimile 
machines cable television satellites and improvements in 
telephones were helping fuel unrest faster than the experts knew 
whatever the reason many scholars acknowledge they were having 
trouble with their crystal balls 
they couldnt see the forest for the trees because they were 
so involved in discussing how you count aircraft and all the arcane 
aspects of nuclear strategy and nato doctrine said the heritage 
foundations holmes when these seismic changes were occurring 
they were very slow to see what the implications were 
holmes said he was thinking in terms of two or three years when 
he told a reporter in october that it could happen a lot sooner 
than a lot of people think 
now said turner i would say that by the end of the year in 
many respects there will be de facto reunification 
it now looks as though it is possible within a year mathias 
agreed some aspects of it might string out for a couple of 
years but the fact is something has to happen pretty fast 
events are indeed moving rapidly on monday in ottawa the 
united states west germany britain and france agreed on 
international conferences on security aspects of unification 
possibly soon after the march 18 east german elections 
on tuesday in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl and east 
german prime minister hans modrow agreed to start work on adopting 
west german currency for both countries on wednesday the west 
german government said the final obstacles to reunification had 
been removed 
gorbachev was the key turner said mikhail gorbachev is a 
very unpredictable man if he had decided to back up former east 
german president erich honecker honecker would still be there 
holmes while stressing the importance of gorbachevs steps 
cautioned this of course has not been played out yet and we 
are not fully certain of what the consequences are going to be 
former secretary of state william rogers asked in november 
about the outlook for one germany said he thought it would be a 
reality when east and west germany fielded one olympic team and he 
didnt expect this to happen before two fouryear olympic cycles 
were completed now reports from west berlin say a reuniting of 
the two countries olympic teams for the 1992 games is considered 
likely

after years of championing better 
eastwest relations foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of 
west germany returned to his east german hometown to be hailed as 
the architect of unification 
the whirlwind events of the last few months have bolstered 
genscher one of the first to take mikhail s gorbachev at his word 
when the soviet leader promised reform 
even occasional backbiting by us and british officials failed 
to stop genscher an affable and unflappable veteran diplomat whose 
protruding elephant ears have become his trademark 
referring to genschers legendary globetrotting soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze once joked that whenever two airliners 
cross paths over the atlantic genscher is on both of them 
while german unification itself would be his crowning 
achievement genschers trip back home friday to the decaying 
industrial city of halle provided an emotional high point 
about 60000 people crammed into the marketplace to give him a 
rousing heros welcome handing the 62yearold diplomat flowers 
and chanting for him to stay with them 
while the outdoor event was a campaign rally for the east german 
counterpart of genschers free democrats there was no doubt about 
the real star of the show 
a large banner on the town hall steps read halle welcomes 
hansdietrich genscher architect of unity 
the local newspaper featured a spread about genschers childhood 
in the city he left behind when he fled his communist homeland for 
west germany nearly 40 years ago 
genscher was the man who made all these developments toward 
german unity possible said albrecht klemenz a 37yearold 
physicist in halle he worked for years to win trust and improve 
relations between the two blocs and that was an important 
precondition 
for several years officials in washington and london used the 
term genscherism to describe what they saw as an attitude of 
excessive confidence in moscow 
now germans invoke the same term proudly to sum up their 
countrys achievements as a visionary force in european diplomacy 
perhaps genschers first major victory came in september after 
weeks of frantic efforts he appeared on the balcony of the west 
german embassy in prague czechoslovakia and told thousands of 
east germans they could leave for west germany 
the roar of approval touched the usually calm politician who 
has served as foreign minister since 1974 
that was the most moving point of my political career 
genscher told reporters outside the embassy compound 
in his speech friday genscher called for immediate recognition 
of polands present borders this would ease polish worries about 
losing to a united germany land it gained from germany after world 
war ii and it would remove an obstacle to reunification 
both german states can make an important contribution to 
stability in europe after the march 18 east german election by 
saying we germans do not have territorial claims on any one of 
our neighbors also not on the polish people he told the 
cheering crowd many spectators carried west german flags 
this peaceful revolution in east germany has brought honor to 
our entire german nation i am proud of halle on the salle he 
said visibly moved halle lies on the salle river in saxony in the 
southwestern part of east germany 
at the end of the speech the crowd mobbed genscher shouting 
hansdietrich along with the nowfamiliar germany united 
fatherland 
genscher was born in the nearby suburb of reideburg and his 
parents later moved to halle itself he returned to the 
sovietoccupied sector of his homeland after he was captured by the 
americans and imprisoned in britain until the end of world war ii 
the local newspaper freiheit mentions a cousin in the suburb of 
liskau as possibly the only immediate genscher relative left in the 
area 
freiheit featured an interview with that cousin werner ruehl 
in its friday edition 
we havent lost contact since 1952 the newspaper quoted 
ruehl as saying referring to the year genscher escaped to the west 
after growing disenchanted with the communist state he visits us 
every year usually around christmas 
genscher has long been troubled by health problems including 
heart trouble and a bout of tuberculosis in the 1950s

when the census bureau sets out to count 
americans in a few weeks workers will have all new maps the 
result of a massive cartographic cooperation by government agencies 
the project was undertaken because its not enough for the 
census to just count everyone every 10 years it also has to report 
where they are 
since 1983 the us geological survey and the census bureau have 
worked together to compile a new set of computerized maps known as 
tiger for topologically integrated geographic encoding and 
referencing 
censustakers for years were plagued by old and inaccurate maps 
sometimes setting forth with nothing more detailed than highway 
department road maps 
highway department maps typically only show the roads they 
maintain which are not all roads often they are very deficient 
for census purposes but they were the best available explained 
robert marx chief of the census bureaus geography division 
now all that has changed 
the tiger system allows us to tailor maps to the enumerator 
if you are working in downtown new york city you need a different 
type of map than if you are working in rural kansas observed 
marx and crew leaders need different maps from their workers 
tiger maps are stored on computer tape making it easy to change 
them and to run new copies as needed 
copies of the new local census maps have been sent to more than 
39000 local governments across the nation in recent months with 
preliminary housing counts going to 21000 local governments marx 
explained 
officials were asked to check the maps and make additions or 
corrections which then are entered in the computers for use in the 
april 1 census 
on the housing counts we have heard from about 13 percent of 
the 21000 governments he said 
comments ranged from it looks fine to some fairly serious 
problems where we have identified problems we are recanvassing the 
area to find out what happened and to get it fixed marx said 
this local review will be repeated after the census the maps 
will be sent out again along with the housing unit and population 
counts by block 
local governments then will be able to check for omissions and 
census officials will recanvass areas where questions are raised 
the 497000 tiger maps are at a variety of scales with a map 
inch equaling from onetwelfth to onethird of a mile on land 
large enough for workers to list every house and make small 
notations about them 
included on the maps are roads railroads rivers and government 
boundaries as well as postal zip code areas census blocks and 
tracts 
this allows the bureau to pinpoint every household location to 
be sent a census form or visited to make sure the residents are 
counted 
the fouryear effort to compile the maps cost 300 million and 
was based on the geological surveys topographic maps of the 
nation those maps were converted to computer form and then about 
1200 workers added the political boundaries streets highways and 
houses 
the workers added 63000 area names 45000 census tract 
numbers 300000 enumeration district numbers and 25 million block 
numbers 
the final maps will be released for government business or 
public use and they are expected to be helpful in routing police 
and rescue vehicles and in land management in addition the 
computer files will be sold to private firms

the bush administrations proposal to start 
requiring veterans to make down payments on home loans uses a 
forecast that a top veterans affairs official acknowledges is too 
pessimistic 
the administration in its 1991 budget proposal said it wants 
va loan borrowers to make a 4 percent down payment on loans over 
25000 currently the va loan program is distinguished from other 
mortgage programs by the lack of a required down payment 
the administration also proposes raising from 125 percent to 
175 percent a loanmaking fee that took effect in january and it 
wants to limit the number of veterans who can gain exemption from 
the fee because of serviceconnected disabilities 
the department of veterans affairs says the changes are needed 
to keep the program afloat in the face of rising losses due to 
foreclosures officials attribute the foreclosure problem to 
national and regional recessions in the past decade 
but the administrations fiscal 1991 budget relies on more 
optimistic economic assumptions 
according to the bush economic projections personal income is 
supposed to rise more than onethird over 1988 levels by 1995 
while wages and salaries are supposed to rise by more than 
onehalf unemployment the forecast says likely will stabilize at 
5 percent of the labor force 
the va based its feeraising proposals on a projection of likely 
future foreclosure rates of 10 percent to 11 percent over 10 years 
said bill lutes assistant director for program management in the 
vas loan guaranty service 
he said that figure represents a balance between the relatively 
low foreclosure rates of the 1970s and the doubledigit rates of 
the 80s 
but during a hearing last april before the house veterans 
affairs subcommittee on housing keith pedigo director of the va 
loan guaranty program acknowledged the 11 percent projection was 
too high 
my personal opinion is that the actual foreclosure rate will 
be somewhat less than 11 percent pedigo said under questioning 
by the subcommittee chairman democrat harley o staggers jr of 
west virginia 
i think the range of 7 percent to 8 percent is probably more 
realistic than 11 percent said pedigo 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office used a rate of 7 
percent over 10 years or 803 percent over the 30year life of the 
mortgage 
pedigo in a recent interview conceded that the 11 percent 
figure would be on the high side but he maintained the 
projection was nevertheless within the reasonable range 
and he insisted that the generally rosy economic projection 
underlying the overall bush budget proposal does not apply to the 
loan program 
some congressmen involved in veterans issues argue that the 
administration put the new loan proposal together too hastily they 
say it ignores a separate effort by lawmakers to reinvigorate the 
va program 
the proposals appear to be a broad attack by the president and 
the office of management and budget on a 46yearold program to 
which congress overwhelmingly recommitted itself just three months 
ago said sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate 
veterans affairs committee 
critics of the administration proposal both in and out of 
congress as well as various government audits say the va must 
bear much of the blame for losses because of insufficient staffing 
and poor management 
they also complain that the va for too long has succumbed to the 
temptation to unload va loan portfolios at firesale prices for 
quick cash fixes rather than waiting for the loans to mature 
the money raised by the higher loan origination fee would go to 
the mortgage guaranty and indemnity fund which was created in 
january 
congress said the trust fund would protect the lender borrower 
and government from losses on bad loans and would sustain itself 
through the decade 
but va officials during a jan 29 budget briefing disagreed 
with congress on how well the fund would work they presented a 
chart showing the fund would be 193 million in the red by 1995 
unless a down payment were required and the loan origination fee 
raised 
congress and the va are at odds on the prospects for the funds 
success because they disagree on the severity of the foreclosure 
problem 
an earlier fund that relied on a 1 percent fee was set up 
differently and made no effort to be selfsufficient as a result 
24 billion in homeloan losses have been swallowed by the 
treasury since 1984

for a decade congress has grappled with us 
policy toward el salvador and spent some 4 billion supporting its 
government in a civil war with leftist rebels 
about 70000 people have died victims of the fighting of 
leftwing assassins or of rightwing death squads and for all the 
aid critics of the us policy say the united states has bought 
little or nothing 
now congress is gearing up for yet another debate over el 
salvador as it considers president bushs request for a total of 
375 million in aid for the year that begins oct 1 
as usual the battle comes against a backdrop of rightwing 
murders amid protests over the us stance and with warnings that 
any signal of wavering support could throw the country into even 
worse chaos 
but this time there are new elements for the first time in the 
history of the countrys civil war an army colonel and seven 
others have been charged with deathsquadstyle murders in 
connection with the killing of six jesuit priests their 
housekeeper and her daughter 
whether the countrys rickety judicial system and president 
alfredo cristiani whose government brought the charges can stand 
the strain of a trial scheduled for may remains unclear but few on 
capitol hill are talking seriously about a wholesale slash in aid 
while the government attempts to bring the killers to justice 
another new element is a proposal by sen christopher dodd 
dconn that seeks for the first time to give the united states 
some leverage over the behavior of the leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
for years us conservatives have pointed at the fmln largely 
armed with sovietbloc weapons as the evildoers in el salvador 
emotions have been high as they berated the left for what they said 
was placing the primary burden of finding peace on the government 
now dominated by cristianis rightwing arena party 
the standard response has been that the us aid and therefore 
us influence extends only to the countrys government efforts 
on the other side of the equation have been largely limited to 
asking the soviets to stop sending arms 
dodds proposal seeks to rewrite the equation by cutting us 
military aid in half 
if the san salvador government fails to go along with united 
nationssponsored peace negotiations it would lose the other half 
of the aid if the fmln walks away from the talks or mounts a major 
military offensive like its attack on the capital last november 
the military aid to the government would be restored to its full 
level 
i believe this formula tests the goodwill on both sides to 
pursue an equitable and just political settlement and offers the 
best chance for achieving that result dodd said when he 
introduced the idea 10 days ago 
the proposals appeal for lawmakers likely will be that it 
represents a middle ground between the administrations 
fullspeedahead approach and the effort by a handful of liberal 
senators to cut aid off entirely and for the first time it would 
apply limited us pressure on both sides to reach an agreement 
rather than putting the burden totally on one side or the other 
members of congress have come under heavy pressure particularly 
from church groups to curtail salvadoran aid last week a group 
of activists in the spokane wash district of house speaker 
thomas foley won a commitment from him to study the dodd proposal 
much still depends on events in el salvador over the coming 
months including whether all sides can be satisfied that the 
killers of the priests are identified and punished and progress is 
made toward bolstering the judicial system and the pursuit of peace 
if they dont do those things then theyre in serious 
trouble on their aid package said rep david bonior dmich 
salvador has to understand that theres lots of demand for the 
aid pie right now theyve clearly got to understand that there are 
competing interests

president bush still is insisting 
that a reunified germany be part of the nato alliance as two top 
western leaders speculate the soviets will drop their objections to 
such a move 
there will be a lot of discussions before now and the event 
bush said sunday when asked by reporters about newly voiced soviet 
reservations regarding a unified germany joining nato 
we have our position supporting west german chancellor 
helmut kohl we know what kohls position is were just going to 
stay with it bush said during a beach outing near his vacation 
home 
kohl contends that if east and west germany reunite the country 
should be in nato although he does not advocate nato troops in 
east germany 
on saturday top soviet official valentin falin said that if the 
western alliance insists on a unified germany joining nato then 
there wont be any german unification 
the soviet position appears to be hardening against nato 
membership for the two germanies as talks on reunification get 
underway among east and west germany and the powers that divided 
them the united states france britain and the soviet union 
but secretary of state james a baker iii and nato secretary 
manfred woerner both said sunday they do not believe the soviet 
objections are final 
were going to have to see the degree to which they really 
feel that way baker said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program for myself i would tell you that im not so 
sure that they really strongly feel that way 
i think without putting words in the mouths of the soviets 
that they see the stability that is afforded by the continued 
presence of united states forces in europe he said 
woerner interviewed on the same television program said he 
believes the soviets will change their minds under one condition 
that we give them a clear guarantee this is not turning against 
them 
woerner contended the soviets are engaged in a tactical play 
and that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev hasnt staked out a 
firm position on the matter of german alignment 
if they really think their own legitimate security interests 
through it will be better for them to have a germany which is in a 
stable condition and is firmly embedded in safety and security 
structures than to have a neutral germany floating around trying 
to form alliances woerner said 
both baker and horst teltschik foreign policy adviser to kohl 
predicted sunday that unification of germany will take place by 
years end 
unification is taking place as we sit here this morning on 
the ground economically baker said 
bush also said sunday that he wants to invite gorbachev to join 
him for a visit to his seaside vacation home when the soviet leader 
comes to the united states for a summit meeting this spring 
bush said he wants to host gorbachev in kennebunkport if we 
can do it 
i think hed enjoy it the president told reporters as he 
and his wife barbara took a fastpaced power walk on the beach 
in subfreezing temperatures 
bush said however he has not yet invited gorbachev to maine 
the president already has had three heads of state to his 
walkers point home french prime minister francois mitterrand 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney and danish prime minister 
poul schluter 
the bushes today were concluding a threeday holiday weekend at 
their home on walkers point

a military appeals court cites bias among 
members of a court martial jury in overturning a marine corporals 
conviction for having sex with another woman court documents show 
barbara j baum who served 226 days in the brig in 1988 said 
this weekend she had expected to be exonerated because i knew it 
was unfair from the start and id said all along it wasnt all 
over 
the court of military review in washington ruled on thursday 
that two of the officers serving on the jury at baums court 
martial were biased and that the military judge allowed 
uncorroborated testimony 
i think that her trial was flawed in a number of respects and 
i am glad that they recognized the errors that they did said 
susan masling an attorney with the washington law firm of arnold 
and porter which represented baum at no charge 
they technically are free to retry her at another court 
martial however as we understand the law she would not be able 
to serve any more time in the brig so the only thing they could 
get out of another court martial besides a lot of bad publicity 
is perhaps getting her a bad conduct discharge masling said 
but lt col ron stokes a marine spokesman said last week that 
no decision had been made yet on a new trial 
the appellate court declined to rule on several other arguments 
raised in the appeal including that it is unconstitutional to 
selectively prosecute and punish homosexuals for sodomy while 
heterosexuals are not punished for the same actions 
baum said she will continue to fight to force the government to 
pay the 14000 bill from her first lawyer although she was not 
paid during the time she spent in the brig she has not sought to 
recover back pay 
baum 25 is originally from mishawaka ind but now lives in 
lakewood fla 
according to court papers the threejudge military appeals 
panel last week found that two jurors identified only as sgt 
major moore and col nunnally were not impartial 
moore had attended baums socalled article 32 investigation 
which is akin to a grand jury and had listened to the governments 
key witness 
sergeant major moores statement that he attended appellants 
article 32 investigation moreover suggested that he had some 
interest in the outcome of the case the judges wrote the 
military judge failed to ask him why he attended the hearing 
thereby leaving his reasons open to speculation 
nunnally revealed during the early stages of baums trial that 
he had discussed the investigation of lesbian activities at parris 
island with a navy investigator 
colonel nunnally appears to have extrajudicial knowledge of 
the evidence and an interest in the outcome of the litigation 
the judges wrote 
baum was the first of five women charged in a crackdown in 1988 
on alleged lesbians at the marine corps parris island sc 
recruit depot 
the defense departments official policy states that 
homosexuality is incompatible with military service the presence 
in the military of persons who engage in homosexual conduct 
seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission 
baum had been charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice 
sodomy indecent acts obstruction of justice and communicating a 
threat 
the woman with whom she allegedly had sex lance cpl diana 
maldonado testified against baum at the court martial but the 
appeals panel found the lack of independent corroboration rendered 
maldonados testimony insufficient as a matter of law 
baum was convicted in june 1988 sentenced to a year in prison 
and a dishonorable discharge but five months later her commanding 
officer maj gen jarvis d lynch granted baum clemency she was 
freed after serving 226 days in the brig at quantico va 
her dishonorable discharge was upgraded to a bad conduct 
discharge but lynch left intact portions of baums sentence that 
reduced her rank to private and required her to forfeit all pay and 
allowances

mayor marion barry and his advisers are 
planning the next step in his treatment for substance abuse with 
the only certainty being that he will not remain at the florida 
rehabilitation clinic he entered following his arrest on a drug 
charge 
barry who was indicted last week on perjury and cocaine 
charges was visited in florida on sunday by top aides to discuss 
options for a new treatment facility according to top government 
officials and the mayors political advisers 
barry was scheduled to complete a 28day treatment cycle for 
alcoholism at the hanleyhazelden clinic in west palm beach fla 
today and leave the facility on wednesday officials said his 
impending plans have not been formalized they said 
city administrator carol b thompson and the mayors chief of 
staff maudine cooper arrived at the clinic sunday to weigh 
treatment options the sources said although thompson and cooper 
said they were in florida only to discuss routine legislative 
matters 
however they said an announcement on barrys treatment would be 
made this week mayoral aides said last week that a top priority 
would be to enroll barry in a more secluded treatment facility 
barrys wife effie also was expected to participate in the 
treatment discussion said government officials and barry advisers 
the mayor entered hanleyhazelden on jan 22 four days after he 
was arrested on a cocaine possession charge in an fbi sting 
operation 
barry may enter the betty ford clinic in rancho mirage calif 
according to a top adviser barry expressed a desire to enter the 
ford clinic during the weekend following his arrest but settled on 
hanleyhazelden when no spaces were available according to sources 
barry is scheduled to appear in federal court wednesday to 
answer an eightcount drug and perjury indictment handed up last 
thursday although district of columbia corporation counsel herbert 
o reid said the mayor is unlikely to appear 
its my understanding that ken r kenneth mundy barrys 
personal attorney has determined that the mayor himself need not 
appear reid said mundy can answer those charges for him 
attempts to reach mundy by telephone were unsuccessful judy 
smith a spokeswoman for us attorney jay b stephens said last 
week that federal officials believe barry must answer the charges 
in person 
mundy has said the mayor will plead innocent to all eight 
charges 
barry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
were uncertain whether the mayor will return to the nations 
capital this week or go directly to a new treatment facility 
at least one political adviser has cautioned the mayor against 
returning yet 
hes got a good chance to lick this thing both the charges 
and the addiction but he needs to demonstrate that hes serious 
about it said the source who spoke on the condition his name 
not be used he can do that by going right back into treatment 
and if he stays away from here he can avoid being besieged by the 
media 
since entering the florida facility barry has been in daily 
telephone contact with either thompson who is handling the 
daytoday operation of the government or cooper 
in addition cooper has made at least two trips to florida 
carrying bills and government documents that required the mayors 
signature 
barry has been charged with three counts of lying to a grand 
jury about his drug involvement and five counts of cocaine 
possession the perjury counts all of which are felonies each 
carry a penalty of five years in prison and a maximum fine of 
250000 barry also faces a maximum of one year in prison and a 
100000 fine for each misdemeanor possession charge 
a perjury conviction would require barry to resign and bar him 
from holding elected office again 
the perjury indictments and four of the five possession charges 
stem from a 14month probe into barrys ties to a convicted drug 
dealer the fifth possession charge is the result of barrys jan 
18 arrest at a downtown washington hotel while visiting a longtime 
woman companion

of the tongueincheek maplewood njbased institute said 
sunday 
caruba would like to see a media recess in which nothing is 
said or written about the trumps for at least a week allowing for 
some minimal sanity to return to the newsrooms of america 
the trumps began making headlines feb 11 when the daily news 
reported trump was leaving his wife reports that a prenuptial 
agreement would give ivana 25 million a connecticut mansion and

drug policy director william bennett says he 
favors something analogous to the death penalty for highlevel 
bankers who launder drug money 
bennett has expressed support for the death penalty for 
convicted drug kingpins in an appearance sunday on nbctvs meet 
the press program he said bankers who knowingly handle drug cash 
should be treated similarly 
if were talking about capital punishment for people who are 
highlevel drug dealers we ought to be talking about something 
analogous for the highlevel banker who trades in drug cash said 
bennett 
president bushs proposed drug control strategy calls for 
expanding the circumstances under which convicted drug kingpins 
could face the death penalty 
bennetts comment came during questioning about a case in which 
the luxembourgbased bank of credit and commerce international 
pleaded guilty in january to cocainerelated moneylaundering 
charges and agreed to forfeit 14 million and to help prosecutors 
who say the case has ties to deposed panamanian leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
bennett indicated he was concerned that the sentence was light 
and said he raised that concern with bush and he agreed 
the bank remains in business bennett said the case is part of 
an ongoing investigation and that he and other officials will 
continue to monitor it

the chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee says the bush administrations fiscal 1991 budget would 
repeat wasteful mistakes of the previous decade by rushing weapon 
systems into production without enough testing 
when we look at our military procurement strategy it still 
reflects the thinking of the early 1980s rep john dingell 
dmich said in a feb 9 letter to president bush made public 
sunday 
dingell said 10 billion to 20 billion could be trimmed from 
bushs proposed 292 billion defense budget by delaying the 
purchase of weapons in need of further research and testing 
including a navy attack submarine and destroyer and the air forces 
b2 bomber 
pentagon spokeswoman chris cimko and white house spokesman doug 
davidson both said they could not comment 
as the united states underwent its biggest military buildup 
since world war ii in the early 1980s the pentagons weapon 
acquisition policy was geared toward getting major weapons 
systems produced and fielded today not tomorrow dingell wrote 
the primary method for expediting these procurements was to 
rush the systems into production prior to the completion of design 
engineering and testing this process of concurrency or buy before 
you fly has resulted in untold waste 
in the worst case the reagan administration contracted to buy 
100 b1b bombers for more than 20 billion before the plane was 
properly tested and evaluated dingell said

when the contra chief of staff 
learned a top comandante was going to lay down his arms and return 
to nicaragua for the elections he assembled the troops 
the message israel galeano had for the fighters of the quilali 
battalion on the day after christmas at their honduran base camp 
was blunt and unforgiving 
luis adan fley he said was a traitor 
if i return hell have me shot said fley this is what 
he said to the troops of the quilali 
under central american peace accords the ruling sandinistas in 
nicaragua offered amnesty to all members of the ussupported 
contra rebel force which has been fighting to overthrow the 
leftist government 
fley became the only active rebel commander to accept amnesty 
and return home before the electoral hand plays out sunday 
why did the man best known by his nom de guerre comandante 
johnson defy the rebel high command and leave his comradesinarms 
after eight hard years 
there are two groups inside the resistance those fighting for 
power and those fighting for the democratization of nicaragua 
fley said if id been fighting for power i would have stayed 
fley said he came home because he believes the new nicaraguan 
battleground is finally the ballot box the time has arrived 
he said for the people to decide with their vote what kind of 
government they want 
the armed struggle has borne its fruit he said last week 
during a campaign rally in matagalpa his hometown 60 miles 
northeast of managua for the 14party opposition alliance trying 
to unseat the ruling sandinistas 
the sandinistas have embarked upon a process of 
democratization and to elections the armed struggle isnt 
justified anymore it would only be justified if the sandinistas 
committed fraud or refused to hand over power he said 
with more than 1000 international observers fley thinks the 
possibility of fraud is remote and he is convinced the 
sandinistas will lose 
i dont have any doubt ive been all over nicaragua and i am 
sure uno the united national opposition will win by a 31 
margin he said 
the uno slate is led by publisher violeta barrios de chamorro 
president daniel ortegas principal opponent 
if fley is wrong and the sandinistas win the contra veteran 
insists he is ready to recognize an honest sandinista victory and 
remain in nicaragua as part of the peaceful opposition 
ive been influenced by the changes in europe systems have 
been changed without a shot being fired he said why cant we 
do this 
were a backward country we resolve all our problems with 
bullets and with killing anyone who thinks differently we have to 
evolve and imitate these european countries he said 
fley 39 said he doesnt believe the sandinistas if 
victorious will risk international condemnation by stifling the 
peaceful opposition 
they cant begin jailing all their opponents sending them 
into exile and killing them he said they have a lot of 
credibility problems abroad and economic problems they need the 
opposition to have a credible government 
sandinista leaders have made it clear they expect clean 
elections to bring improved relations with the united states and 
substantial international help in rebuilding an economy shattered 
by war us economic embargo and mismanagement 
fley who was running the contra office in tegucigalpa the 
honduran capital said he began negotiating his return a few days 
before christmas he agreed to renounce the armed struggle in 
exchange for government guarantees that he would not be 
investigated detained persecuted or drafted into the military 
although fleys decision to return is unique among the senior 
rebel commanders it illustrates the hopes raised by the election 
as well as the deep gulfs that must still be bridged before there 
can be national reconciliation 
two brothers both officers in the sandinista army were on hand 
to greet fley when he returned jan 8 along with eight 
lowerranking contras a third brother had died in a rebel ambush 
in 1987 
fley and his 32yearold brother francisco had fought together 
with the sandinistas in the 1979 revolution that ousted the somoza 
family dictatorship 
they had last seen each other in october 1988 francisco now a 
captain was leading a mission charged with persuading fley to 
commit 1200 rebel troops to a ceasefire in matagalpa province 
but fley deeply suspicious of the sandinistas instead took his 
brother prisoner to embarrass the army they spent eight days 
together in the hills trying to persuade each other to stop 
fighting 
neither budged 
although fley has come home believing nicaragua is on the road 
to democracy much remains the same he has talked with franciso 
and with his other brother jorge a lieutenant only briefly since 
his return 
its always the same rhetoric that their chiefs say they 
never say anything else fley said 
jorge 29 agreed there has been no political rapprochement 
among the brothers but he still believes his elder brothers 
return offers hope for peace and reconciliation 
i think luis has taken an important step jorge said he 
is well known among the contras he commanded a lot of men its a 
step toward peace in nicaragua

when it comes to bedroom habits americans 
are a rather staid lot a new survey concludes 
on average adults say they have sex once a week if they are 
married its almost invariably with their spouse and they 
overwhelmingly eschew homosexuality 
this shows that the sexual behavior of americans is more 
circumspect and traditional than the libertine impression we get 
from the popular media and fiction said tom w smith of the 
university of chicago who directed the survey 
a separate study shows that teenage boys as well are not 
living up to their reputations 
it found that adolescents seem to be having sex less often with 
fewer girls and at a later age than teenagers did a decade ago 
this contrasts sharply with the view that most young men are 
sexually promiscuous said fredya l sonenstein of the urban 
institute in washington who analyzed the results 
both reports were among sex surveys outlined sunday at a meeting 
of the american association for the advancement of science 
the university of chicago results were based on interviews and 
questionnaires administered to a crosssection of 1500 adults in 
1988 and 1989 the questions were added to the general social 
survey which has been conducted annually since 1972 
surprisingly little is known about the sex lives of ordinary 
americans smith said 
his survey found that on average adults have sex 57 times a 
year or about once a week 
we dont know what night of the week he said but it 
sounds like the traditional stereotype of every saturday night 
sexual frequency dropped with age from about 78 times a year for 
those under 40 to eight times for those over 70 overall married 
people have sex 67 times a year separated people 66 times 
divorced and nevermarried people 55 and widowed people six the 
survey found 
however 22 percent of people said they had no sex partners at 
all during the previous year nine percent of married people were 
abstinate as were 86 percent of widowed people 
among other findings 
only 15 percent of married people admitted cheating on their 
spouses during the previous year 
between 91 percent and 93 percent of people have been 
exclusively heterosexual during their adult lives five percent to 
6 percent have been bisexual and less than 1 percent are 
exclusively homosexual about 3 percent have never had sex 
married people who say they are the happiest also have the most 
sex 
seven percent of adults are at relatively high risk of catching 
aids because they have multiple sex partners they have sex with 
strangers or they are homosexual 
smith said some people probably lied about their sex habits 
especially unmarried men who seemed to inflate the vigor of their 
sex lives and unmarried women who claimed to experience less sex 
than they actually were having but in general he said he had 
reasonable confidence in the data 
the survey of adolescent boys was based on interviews with 1880 
people between ages 15 and 19 in 1988 the results were compared 
with a similar survey in 1979 
the boys said they had had six sex partners compared with seven 
a decade earlier they reported having had sex an average of three 
times during the previous month compared with almost five times in 
the earlier survey 
condom use has also changed dramatically apparently out of fear 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome now 57 percent say they 
wear condoms which is more than twice as many as a decade ago 
the researchers didnt give a margin of error for either survey

officials of the sierra club which promotes 
recycling say they dont use recycled paper in their lushly 
illustrated nature calendars partly because the photographs may not 
reproduce well 
two denverarea club branches calling that stance hypocritical 
have stopped selling the annual fundraising calendars and a state 
chapter official warns a real revolt is possible among members 
statewide 
as a group we cant walk one way and talk another way said 
michael reis a spokesman for the 1500member enos mills group 
how can we take a hard stand in promoting recycling when our own 
group doesnt use recycled paper 
the 1100member rachel carson group also voted to end sales of 
the calendars which sell for 695 and up and an executive 
committee for all colorado members plans a vote soon on a similar 
boycott 
if we dont see any commitment from the national group to 
increase their use of recycled paper well see a real revolt 
said eugene demayo chairman of the rocky mountain regional chapter 
but paul larmer spokesman at sierra club headquarters in san 
francisco said the organization doesnt have the equipment to do 
it right now and another concern is that slick glossy color 
photographs do not reproduce as well on recycled paper 
we get many many letters from our members about this issue 
and there is an internal task force looking into the issue right 
now he said i think eventually were going to go all recycled 
paper 
but old habits are hard to break larmer said 
reis said that although the recycled paper produces a slightly 
less glossy print others including the denver water board a 
longtime opponent of environmental groups because of its proposed 
two forks dam are doing it 
if the denver water board can do it why cant the sierra 
club said reis 
a boulder publisher johnson books now is producing two 
environmental books with recycled paper and although it is more 
expensive officials say it is worth it 
it looks good and every ton we use saves 17 trees said 
publisher barbara johnson mussil 
the sierra club was founded in 1892 by conservationist john muir 
and is a nonprofit national organization dedicated to preserving 
wilderness areas and natural parks 
at least 10000 of the clubs nature calendars are sold in 
colorado each year and hundreds of thousands are sold nationwide 
reis said

the dollar fell marginally against the japanese yen 
monday while the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged as 
investor concern quickly shifted from a national election to the 
possibility of a rise in a key interest rate 
the dollar closed at 14452 yen down 003 yen from fridays 
14455yen finish it opened at 14428 yen and ranged between 
14410 yen and 14458 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average plunged 23772 points or 
063 percent closing at 3722260 it had lost 1167 points last 
friday 
the comfortable majority secured by the governing liberal 
democratic party in sundays general election failed to boost share 
prices because the victory had been factored into the market 
since last week said yuji kawakami an analyst with nomura 
securities co 
the governing party won 275 seats more than expected in the 
powerful 512seat lower house of parliament six opposition parties 
together secured 237 seats including 136 won by the socialist 
party the largest opposition group 
sundays election was seen as a crucial challenge for the 
governing party which had lost its majority in the lesspowerful 
upper house in an election last summer following a series of sex 
and money scandals involving liberal democrats 
reassured by the result of the election investors are already 
concerned about a possible discount rate hike which they speculate 
may come at any moment kawakami said 
also pushing the nikkei down was a decline in japanese 
government bond prices which resulted from the yens poor 
performance against the dollar kawakami said 
in currency dealings the yen has not been getting much support 
despite expectations for the ruling partys victory and a rise in 
the bank of japans official discount rate dealers said 
they said the market reacted little to the election results 
although the market might not have expected the liberal 
democrats to gain so many seats the partys majority in the house 
has been factored in to the market said kimio kobori a dealer 
with the bank of tokyo 
he said trading was rather quiet as currency players were 
awaiting the release of japans money supply figure scheduled for 
tuesday 
the money supply figure would be an important indicator for 
market players to judge the likelihood of yet another discount rate 
rise kobori said 
following three rises last year the nations discount rate now 
stands at 425 percent

a vietnamese man denied refugee status hanged 
himself at his detention center in the first suicide among boat 
people in hong kong officials said today 
nguyen van hai 28 was found hanging from his belt in a 
bathroom at the whitehead detention center on friday and taken to a 
hospital where he died sunday night officials said 
hais appeal for refugee status had been refused by a government 
review board the day before he hanged himself according to the 
hong kong office of the united nations high commissioner for 
refugees 
the hong kong standard newspaper reported hais left a note 
saying i am killing myself to protest against the screening 
policy of the hong kong government which is too strict and 
unfair 
police spokesman robert yiu said police did not find a suicide 
note 
he said hai had told an interpreter at the hospital that he was 
dissatisified with the screening system that determines whether 
vietnamese are refugees to be resettled or illegal immigrants 
subject to repatriation 
the approximately 44000 vietnamese who have sailed into this 
british colony since june 1988 must prove a fear of persecution in 
their communist homeland or face repatriation 
the detention centers where they are housed have been 
particularly tense since 51 boat people were sent home against 
their will in december 
four vietnamese men have stabbed themselves in the abdomen in 
protest of the screening policy but all have survived the wounds 
yiu said the weekend suicide attempt was the first to succeed

after months of preoccupation with domestic 
problems as people focused on this weeks election japan now must 
now turn to urgent foreign policy issues in talks with visiting 
us defense and trade officials 
japan had several months reprieve from disputes over its 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states as leaders prepared 
for sundays balloting for parliaments lower house 
the conservative liberal democratic party which has governed 
japan since 1955 secured a solid majority of 275 seats in the 
512seat house promising continuity in foreign policy 
talks with us officials on trade in wood products were to 
begin today talks on informal trade barriers follow later this 
week and more talks on trade in satellites and supercomputers are 
slated for next week 
defense secretary dick cheney who arrives tuesday for a 
fiveday visit is expected to press tokyo to spend more to support 
the 50000 us troops based in japan 
us officials charge that japan isnt doing enough to open its 
markets for satellites telecommunications supercomputers forest 
products and finance among others to foreign goods and services 
they predict serious trouble with congress ahead of elections 
for the house of representatives in november if they are unable to 
demonstrate substantial progress in shrinking the deficit with 
japan which accounted for 45 percent of the 108 billion deficit 
last year according to us figures 
once their elections are behind them the japanese must move 
immediately to address our concerns before political reaction here 
hamstrings our chances for constructive negotiations us trade 
representative carla hills said in a recent speech 
within the next two months mrs hills must decide whether 
japans trade practices on lumber satellites and supercomputers 
are unfair and merit retaliation under the socalled super 301 
section of the 1988 us omnibus trade act so far she has said 
the outlook is not overly optimistic 
the negotiations on informal structural barriers to trade are 
more likely to raise mutual expectations than to satisfy 
congressional demands for trade concessions officials on both 
sides say 
in the talks washington has said anticompetitive practices 
such as corporate collusion and an inefficient retail distribution 
system drive up prices and make it difficult for foreign goods to 
enter the japanese market 
japan in turn says the united states needs to raise its low 
savings rate spend more on research and development improve 
education consume less and reduce the federal budget deficit 
the government will face difficulties in passing legislation to 
deal with usjapan problems because the opposition controls the 
upper house and must agree to bills passed by the lower house 
this is particularly true for farm trade issues although japan 
is the largest importer of us agricultural products and has 
gradually liberalized many of its food products markets its 
refusal to permit rice imports is an especially sore point 
opposition parties have adamantly opposed further opening of 
japans farm markets they also oppose increased military spending 
although the lower house has the power to pass the budget even if 
the upper house votes it down 
defense agency directorgeneral juro matsumoto has said tokyo 
does not plan to change its defense budget for fiscal 1991 which 
begins april 1 japan now shoulders about 28 billion or 45 
percent of american troops annual expenses here 
military spending is a controversial issue in japan the 
countrys constitution bans the use of force for settling 
international disputes and the government has tried to keep defense 
spending below 1 percent of the gross national product 278 
billion in fiscal 1991

a sheriffs decision to commandeer the 
local national guard armory to ease jail overcrowding apparently 
struck a chord with john q citizen a spokesman said 
theres a kind of exuberance that someone did something that 
it was a bold act richard mccarthy spokesman for hampden county 
sheriff michael ashe said sunday night as 15 prisoners prepared to 
bed down for the third evening in the armorys gymnasiumsized 
drill hall 
mccarthy said citizens local judges and other law enforcement 
officials have contacted him to voice support for ashe who said he 
occupied the springfield armory friday because he was fed up 
fighting jail overcrowding 
ashe acted after westfield district judge philip conant detained 
two hampden county deputies for five hours after they refused to 
take a prisoner to the overcrowded jail 
ashe planned to ask a hampden superior court judge tuesday for 
an injuction supporting his action as justified due to an imminent 
danger to the publics peace mccarthy said 
mccarthy said ashe also would ask the court to force armory 
officials to hand over keys to the showers and kitchen currently 
prisoners are transported to the jail for showers while food for 
the inmates is brought into the armory 
were going to run right at them in court mccarthy said 
were not going to go into court on the defensive our lawyers 
tells us that were on sound legal ground in taking over the 
armory 
the prison originally was built to hold 279 prisoners the 
federal government has ordered that no more than 450 inmates 
either those serving a sentence or those awaiting trial may be 
housed there 
that cap was exceeded this week and mccarthy said the usual 
remedies of early release late sentencing and housing prisoners 
elsewhere in massachusetts had not provided enough space 
mccarthy blamed the prison space crisis in springfield on 
tougher sentencing laws combined with the publics reluctance to 
finance jails or live near them 
my belief is that what we have in hampden county is a real 
perfect microcosm of the whole national dilemma he said 
theres no constituency for corrections liberals find it 
distasteful and conservatives find any commitment of resources to 
be coddling

a barge loaded with gasoline caught fire 
and spilled some of its cargo when it collided headon with another 
barge in the intracoastal waterway the coast guard said today 
no one was injured and the fire was extinguished at 11 pm 
sunday about 4 hours after the collision coast guard petty 
officer steve guy said 
the waterway was closed as a precaution because of an 
undetermined amount of gasoline in the water and the possibility of 
further fire guy said 
he said crews were letting the burned barge cool down before 
starting to clean up the spilled gasoline today 
the cause of the collision had not been determined guy said 
but weather may have had something to do with it we had a lot of 
rain and visibility was low 
guy said the crash happened when two tugs escorting barges 
approached each other in the intracoastal waterway one tug towed 
two barges each loaded with 30000 barrels of gasoline the other 
tug towed seven barges three empty one containing coke and the 
other a solvent with neutral oil

the farmer who owns part of the field 
of dreams outfield says hell restore the land to playing shape 
in time for tourists this summer 
people came by the thousands last year to see the field created 
for the kevin kostner movie but all they saw was the infield and 
most of right field maintained by farmer don lansing the rest of 
the outfield was planted in corn on land owned by farmer al 
ameskamp 
people came anyway just as baseball greats of many years past 
appeared when a farmer played by kostner listened to a dream voice 
telling him to build it and they will come 
in the summer of 1988 ameskamp and lansing agreed to let 
moviemakers carve a baseball diamond in their fields during 
filming and ameskamp said he was amazed that people wanted to see 
the place a year later 
on some sundays last summer traffic was nearly bumpertobumper 
on the gravel road past the ameskamps farmhouse on the way to the 
field we ate a lot of dust he said 
there has been talk of organized tours visiting the plot next 
summer including some from japan 
i decided even before the japanese thing that id put it back 
into grass this year so the field will be back like it was for the 
movie ameskamp said a lot of people stopped here and talked 
to us and we tossed the idea around for a quite a while before 
deciding to do it 
ameskamp said the field will once again return to crops in 1991 
im figuring that there will be a lot of people come to see it 
this year then next summer itll fizzle out he said

screaming opposition lawmakers shoved 
officials and smashed doors today to protest the aging politicians 
of the ruling nationalist party who will dominate parliaments vote 
for taiwans president 
three opposition assemblymen were dragged by about 60 police 
officers from the convention hall where the national assembly 
convened today for the election they had occupied the podium and 
roughed up officials who tried to stop their demonstration 
the protesters opposed the choice of hsueh yueh a 94yearold 
retired army general to preside over the 35day meeting 
opposition assemblyman tsai shiyuan told the convention that 
choosing hsueh was absurd because he is what the public considers 
an old thief who has not faced reelection in more than four 
decades 
the 752seat national assembly includes 646 members elected in 
china before 1949 when they fled to taiwan with the rest of the 
nationalist chinese government after it lost a civil war to 
communist forces 
the aging assemblymen were frozen in office to support the 
nationalist partys claim that it still is the legitimate ruler of 
china most are at least 70 years old and several die each year 
before the session began a 73yearold member had a heart attack 
at the convention hall and was hospitalized in intensive care 
the opposition democratic progressive party which has just 11 
seats in parliament has staged protests calling for the direct 
election of taiwans president and vice president 
police released the detained opposition assemblymen from a 
locked bus after they smashed the windows with umbrellas they 
quickly returned to the meeting hall and kicked in glass doors 
while president lee tenghui was delivering a speech calling for 
a society with harmony unity law and order 
lee who was nominated as the ruling nationalist partys 
presidential candidate on feb 11 paused briefly during the 
commotion before continuing his speech later opposition 
assemblyman huang chaohui overturned several tables at a luncheon 
banquet as lee toasted the elderly members 
during the national assembly convention the body will review 
the constitution including a temporary provision that gives the 
president the right to retire all members elected on the mainland 
many assemblymen oppose that provision 
the convention will end with the election of taiwans next 
president and vice president 
lee won the universal support of the nationalist partys central 
committee for a full sixyear term as president but many party 
elders were disappointed that he picked a personal aide li 
yuanzu as running mate 
more than 200 aging assemblymen had supported chiang wego a son 
of the late nationalist leader chiang kaishek to be the vice 
presidential candidate 
lee the first taiwan native ever to serve as nationalist 
president assumed that office in january 1988 upon the death of 
president chiang chingguo another son of chiang kaishek

mongolian reformers have capped months of protest 
against the communists political monopoly by founded a party that 
is demanding the ouster of leading officials and a soviet troop 
pullout a foreign source said 
official mongolian television covered some of sundays 
deliberations when the mongolian democratic party pledging to work 
within the constitution was formed sunday from the mongolian 
democratic union 
the union has organized five mass rallies in the past two months 
calling for an end to the communist partys nearly 70yearold 
monopoly rule said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
mongolia a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast 
deserts and grasslands of eastern asia has cautiously followed the 
reform policies taken by its protector state the soviet union 
also sunday chinese communist party chief jiang zemin met a 
highranking mongolian communist party delegation in beijing china 
and its northern neighbor have had strained relations and few 
contacts for the past three decades because of mongolias close 
ties with moscow 
in the mongolian capital of ulan bator more than 470 delegates 
to the mongolican democratic unions first congress almost 
unanimously adopted a party charter and a platform that urges 
changes in mongolias political and economic systems but pledges 
to work within the government constitution and under 
marxistleninist principles the source said 
the democratic union which claims 60000 supporters has 
stressed in the past that it is not against the communist party 
just its monopoly on power 
mongolian premier dumaagiyn sodnom hinted last week that a 
meeting between party and government officials and the democratic 
union might take place after the congress 
the first two hours of the daylong congress were broadcast live 
on television and given prominent coverage on the evening news the 
source said 
although the official press has published editorials and 
readers letters criticizing the movement as misguided the local 
media have given the democratic union considerable attention since 
it was formed in december by intellectuals and artists pressing for 
reform 
sundays meeting in the trade union palace was attended by 300 
observers including ranking government and communist party 
officials and foreign reporters the source said 
he said the meeting was wellorganized and orderly and there 
was no police or government interference the delegates mostly in 
their mid20s to mid30s were from across mongolia 
with a standing ovation delegates also adopted an open letter 
to the people and one to the communist party central committee and 
the great peoples hural or parliament 
the letters repeated calls for the resignation of the council of 
ministers and the party central committee and for trials and 
punishment for leaders of past regimes who brought the country 
its foreign dependence and economic crisis including a huge 
foreign debt the source said 
the soviet union has provided massive loans to mongolia 
estimated by some western economists to exceed 55 billion he 
said 
speakers also called for economic reform a multiparty system 
and withdrawal of foreign troops the source said 
he said it was the first time the union has called for a troop 
withdrawal soviet troops were sent into mongolia to patrol the 
border with china in the mid1960s when relations between the two 
communist powers had broken down and chinas ultraleftist cultural 
revolution was in full swing 
the soviet union began withdrawing its forces in may during a 
visit by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to china the kremlin 
has said it will withdraw 50000 troops threefourths of the 
estimated soviet force in mongolia by the end of 1990 
 
on saturday in ulan bator local news reports said the politburo 
had announced that the capitals last statue of stalin in front of 
the national library was coming down the foreign source said

business leaders breathed a collective sigh of 
relief today at the governing partys electoral victory 
interpreting it as voter support for the policies that have brought 
economic prosperity to japan 
but they warned that the scandalplagued party still must do 
more to bolster public trust 
i saw this election as a test for our nations liberalism and 
my feeling of crisis had been growing eiji suzuki president of 
the japan federation of employers association said in a statement 
eishiro saito chairman of the powerful japan federation of 
economic organizations keidanren told reporters the decision 
by the people not to destroy the foundation of the free economy 
the basis of japanese economic growth to date should be highly 
appreciated 
he welcomed the liberal democratic partys renewed majority in 
parliaments lower house but urged more discussion and mutual 
understanding between the governing and opposition parties for 
greater political stability 
shun ishihara chariman of the japan committee for economic 
development warned the liberal democrats that they should not 
think the public has forgiven and accepted all of their actions 
the party has not fully improved the liberal democratic party 
still needs to be reborn in order to recover the public trust he 
added 
the business community had been concerned about whether the 
probusiness governing party could keep control of the government 
after it lost its majority in parliaments less powerful upper 
house in elections last july 
voters then registered their disapproval of a new 3 percent 
sales tax and a widespread influencebuying scandal in which many 
leading liberal democrats were implicated 
in sundays election for the lower house which names the prime 
minister and controls the budget anger over the tax and scandal 
apparently had faded in addition many voters echoed the view of 
business leaders that the opposition socialists were not capable of 
governing effectively 
the liberal democrats who have governed japan since their 
partys founding in 1955 ended with a comfortable majority 275 
of the lower houses 512 seats the socialists won 136 
the outcome shows that the liberal democrats taxation policy 
including their stance toward the sales tax has been accepted by 
the people said rokuro ishikawa president of the japan chambaer 
of commerce and industry 
the liberal democrats have promised to review the tax which 
took effect in april and possibly lower the levy on groceries 
rents and some other items the opposition has demanded abolition 
of the tax 
keidanrens saito supported the review of the tax but added 
i do hope the parliamentary session will not be disrupted over 
the consumption tax revision when the taxation system is gaining 
general acceptance 
since the opposition controls the upper house a stalemate over 
the tax is possible 
the governing party also might face trouble in enacting 
legislation to deal with usjapan economic friction 
its the most serious concern for me right now that the trade 
dispute between japan and the united states will get worse said 
isao yonekura president of c itoh and co a leading trading 
company 
despite the relief of business leaders over the liberal 
democrats victory the tokyo stock exchanges leading index 
plunged today 
the 225share nikkei stock average rose more than 130 points in 
early trading as final election returns came in but then the 
markets concern turned to the possibility of higher interest 
rates a dampening factor on stock investment the nikkei ended at 
3722260 down 23772 points or 063 percent from last friday

life gradually returned to normal in the 
christian enclave today as mediators tried to devise a political 
settlement to intrachristian battling that has claimed at least 
660 lives 
the commands of renegade gen michel aoun and his rival militia 
warlord samir geagea called in separate statements on employees of 
the water electricity and telephone companies in their areas of 
influence to start repairing damages inflicted in the 18day clash 
by police count 1872 people have been wounded in what has been 
the bloodiest intrachristian confrontation since lebanons civil 
war erupted in april 1975 police estimated material losses at 750 
million 
geageas lebanese forces asked industrial commercial tourist 
and banking institutions to reopen today to help civilians 
resume normal life 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said workers were removing debris and burned cars from 
streets as a twodayold ceasefire held following ferocious 
battles for control of lebanons christian enclave 
but despite the calm people are still wary said the 
spokesman they have seen many other ceasefires collapse some 
areas are still mined and the fortifications have not been 
removed 
the new truce declared saturday was the 12th since the clashes 
started the others failed to take hold 
power plants and waterpumping stations stopped on jan 30 the 
first day of the fighting leaving the lebanese capital and its 
environs without electricity and running water 
a threeman mediating committee grouping independent christian 
figures was expected to hold contacts with aoun and geagea to 
consolidate the ceasefire and work out a settlement to what the 
leftist assafir daily called the game of balancing the maronite 
terror 
both aoun 54 and geagea 38 are maronites the community that 
has dominated the government parliament army and judiciary since 
lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 
aoun started the intrachristian duel by demanding disbandment 
of the 10000man lebanese forces and attacking with his estimated 
19000 army troops when geagea refused 
the voice of lebanon radio station quoted a source close to 
geagea as saying the militia chief was ready to to begin talks 
based on the necessity of mutual respect and safeguarding 
political freedoms 
what brings the lebanese forces and the army together is much 
bigger and deeper than what separates them the source quoted 
geagea as saying the lebanese cause needs the two guns together 
and eliminating one of them will weaken the other 
the source also said geagea was sorry that our society has 
paid this price to be convinced that dialogue is the right path to 
solve all the problems 
a source close to aoun retorted that what geagea has suggested 
is not enough there can only be a solution by unifying the gun 
and not by talking about two guns 
also monday classes resumed at the american university of 
beirut after a suspension of nearly three weeks 
school spokesman radwan mawlawi said the university opened after 
water was provided for the dormitories and other school buildings 
the university lies in syrianpoliced moslem west beirut which 
has not been involved in the christian fighting however the 
moslem sector has been repeatedly hit by shells since the clashes 
erupted leaving at least 31 people killed and 149 wounded 
aoun claims he launched his crackdown on the lebanese forces 
because geagea was out to force the implementation in the 
christian sector of an arab leaguebrokered peace accord to end the 
civil war 
president elias hrawi also a maronite was elected in line with 
the accord in november 
aoun has rejected hrawi as head of state along with the peace 
pact he objects to the accord because it includes no timetable for 
the withdrawal of the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon 
geagea has declared his recognition of hrawi but the militia 
chieftain has refrained from expressing a clear stand on the peace 
pact

scandal and an unpopular sales tax cost the 
longgoverning liberal democratic party voter support but it held 
on to its majority in parliaments lower house and with it the 
right to name the prime minister 
the conservative party that has held power for 34 years lost 20 
seats in sundays balloting but still captured a solid majority of 
275 in the 512seat house the japan broadcasting corp reported 
the party headed by prime minister toshiki kaifu had needed 271 
seats to retain the chairmanships of all lower house committees 
the main opposition japan socialist party led by takako doi 
made dramatic gains rising from 83 seats in the last house to 136 
two prime ministers resigned in quick succession last year amid 
sex and money scandals and the popular had ms doi seemed to have a 
chance to tilt japan to the left and become its first woman prime 
minister 
but japans conservative voters rejected bold change during the 
campaign the liberal democrats capitalized on ideological 
differences in the opposition camp and sowed doubts about the 
oppositions ability to govern 
the socialists potential coalition partners fared poorly 
the komeito clean government party fell from 54 seats in the 
outgoing house elected in july 1986 to 45 the japan communists 
from 26 seats to 16 and the democratic socialist party from 25 
seats to 14 
the remaining seats went to 21 independent candidates and two 
minor parties official final results are to be announced tuesday 
kaifu 59 told reporters he was very thankful for the result 
each candidate worked as if he were crawling on the ground and i 
think people gave us credit for that 
our purpose was to reduce the liberal democrats strength as 
much as possible said ms doi 61 who had campaigned hard on a 
vow to repeal the sales tax unfortunately the results showed 
that in a sense we have not obtained a majority toward abolishing 
the tax 
about 73 percent of the 905 million eligible voters a high 
turnout cast ballots 
when the 271st liberal democratic seat was captured kaifu 
painted in the blank eye of a papiermache doll at party 
headquarters in tokyo to signify fulfillment of the partys goal in 
the election the daruma doll ceremony is traditionally 
performed to indicate fulfillment of a wish 
ichiro ozawa secretary general of the liberal democrats said 
his party would consult with the socialists beginning tuesday over 
steering the nation 
the 3 percent sales tax and a series of scandals which 
contributed to the liberal democrats loss of their majority in the 
less powerful upper house of parliament last summer proved 
insufficient to defeat the liberal democrats 
the opposition never clearly explained its coalition plans 
said takehiko kamo professor of political science at tokyo 
university and so the public didnt feel confident in the idea 
of the idea of transferring power to it 
kaifu declared the election results a form of purification 
for his troubled party yet voters reelected virtually all liberal 
democrats in parliament who were implicated in the recruit stock 
scandal in which many politicians profited from cutrate shares 
simply being elected does not mean one is absolved said 
socialist secretary general tsuruo yamaguchi the need for 
political reform is bigger than ever 
among the candidates linked to the recruit stock scandal who 
still won reelection were former prime ministers yasuhiro 
nakasone 72 noboru takeshita 65 and sousuke uno 67 
takeshita resigned last year after admitting he accepted huge 
donations from the recruit co uno replaced him but lasted just two 
months as prime minister a former geisha said uno had paid her to 
be his mistress and he resigned after the liberal democrats upper 
house loss 
only one recruit figure former vice education minister kunio 
takaishi was defeated takaishi who is being tried on bribery 
charges had not held elective office before 
nakasone formally resigned from the party as atonement for his 
implication in scandal although he has denied wrongdoing 
his reelection may permit him to return to the party and 
greater behindthescenes influence 
a general election is a judgment by the people and i 
passed nakasone said sunday the recruit scandal broke after he 
left office in 1987 but the stocksforfavors transactions took 
place while he was prime minister and he was forced to testify to 
parliament about his links to the recruit co 
altogether as many as 14 successful independents are expected 
to ally themselves with the liberal democrats in the new house 
financial and currency markets showed little reaction to the 
elections outcome

two strong earthquakes struck the 
southwest pacific today causing minor damage to buildings on the 
north island of new zealand and rattling the vanuatu islands 
officials said 
the first quake measuring 64 on the richter scale struck at 
635 pm 1235 am est about 110 miles northeast of the capital 
of wellington according to the us geological survey in golden 
colo 
police said the temblor knocked out telephone service caused 
power blackouts and threw store merchandise off shelves some 
trains were halted as railway staff checked the line and bridges a 
railways corporation spokesman said there were no reports of 
injuries 
usgs spokesman don finley said earthquake monitors indicated 
that although the quake was centered on north island minor damage 
was reported in the palmerston north dannevirke and hastings areas 
the second quake measured at a preliminary magnitude of 68 
shook the vanuatu islands formerly the old new hebrides a little 
more than an hour later at 548 pm local time according to the 
usgs the vanuatu islands are located in a different time zone 
the temblor was centered nearly 2000 miles north of the first 
quake and about 1300 miles northeast of brisbane australia there 
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries finley said 
by usgs standards any movement measuring between 6 and 69 on 
the richter scale is considered a strong earthquake 
those can cause considerable damage in populated areas 
finley explained the vanuatu islands they have earthquakes 
there quite often many of them in the 7 and 8 range and we dont 
get much in the way of damage reports there 
an earthquake of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread 
heavy damage while a temblor measuring 8 or more on the richter 
scale is considered a great earthquake with potential to cause 
tremendous damage according to the geological survey 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means the ground motion 
is 10 times greater

police clashed with leftists today 
over us bases while defense secretary dick cheney warned that 
washington would abandon the six installations unless differences 
over their funding were resolved 
cheney on a twoweek tour of the pacific rim met for three 
hours with philippine defense minister fidel ramos in discussions 
described as very cordial but also very forthright 
the defense ministers were unable however to bridge conflict 
over funding of the us military bases cheny said the united 
states will maintain the installations only as long as the 
philippine people wish it to stay and only if the terms negotiated 
are acceptable to both parties 
there is growing opposition in the philippines to the bases 
which are among the largest outside the continental united states 
in 1988 the united states agreed to pay the philippines about 960 
million to maintain the facilities until their lease expired in 
1991 but this year congress significantly cut financial aid to the 
bases 
about 200 members of the leftist league of filipino students 
chanting yankees go home marched to the us embassy and 
hurled bottles and rotten tomatoes at police who charged them with 
clubs and tear gas 
one student was arrested and at least four policemen were 
injured in the protest which occurred near cheneys hotel 
earlier 50 students burned an effigy of cheney and picketed the 
military headquarters with banners reading cheney warmonger go 
home and white monkey go home with your bases 
in angeles city home of clark air base about 50 miles north of 
manila about 300 protesters hurled rocks at clubwielding police 
who tried to stop them from dismantling barbed wire barricades at 
the entrance 
demonstrators said about 30 students were injured 
relations between the two allies have reached new lows in recent 
weeks 
president corazon aquino refused to see cheney citing the aid 
cuts and anger over what officials consider adverse reports about 
her government in the american press 
cheneys talks with ramos focused on filipino claims the united 
states has failed to live up to its financial obligations for use 
of the six military installations 
this year the bush administration asked congress for 360 
million in funding but the figure was cut by 96 million and us 
diplomats say it is unlikely the money will be restored 
we recognize there is a shortfall of 96 million over what we 
had anticipated cheney said i also pointed out that in east 
asia in this part of the world the united states provided a 
little over 600 million and about 500 million of that comes 
specifically to the philippines 
cheney pledged his best efforts to restore funding cut by 
congress he also denied reports in the philippine press the 
cutbacks signal diminished support for the aquino government 
i think that is a misreading of events to suggest that 
somehow the united states is trying to send signals other than the 
one i have already given publicly which is our very strong 
commitment to our alliance with the philippines 
ramos acknowledged the us administration needs congressional 
approval for aid commitments but said he told cheney time is of 
the essence in meeting obligations 
asked whether filipinos wanted the bases to remain ramos 
declined to answer saying the issue was under discussion in the 
philippine congress 
us and filipino officials are expected to begin talks soon on 
extending the bases any agreement must be approved by twothirds 
of the 23member philippine senate where antibases sentiment is 
strong 
no date for the talks has been set and leading filipino 
congressmen have urged mrs aquino to postpone them until the cuts 
are restored 
cheneys spokesman pete williams said the secretarys meeting 
had not been intended to set a framework for the base 
negotiations 
many filipinos say the united states wants to maintain its bases 
here at all costs and that claims of budgetary pressures and a 
possible voluntary withdrawal are mere negotiating tactics 
being a big rich and powerful nation it the united states 
intends to get what it wants by bamboozling the filipinos into 
submission said the independent daily the manila times 
cheney later visited the us subic bay naval base 50 miles 
west of manila and was to visit clark air base on tuesday before 
departing for japan 
there are some 18000 us military personnel based in the 
philippines with another 20000 civilian and military dependents

striking miners began filing into local 
union halls in three states this morning to decide whether to 
accept a contract that would put them back to work nearly a year 
after they walked off their jobs 
james hicks president of virginia local 1259 in cleveland va 
said he was optimistic his fellow union members would vote for the 
contract 
just listening to the guys talking i believe itll go through 
down here he said everybody feels like its a pretty good 
contract 
united mine workers spokesman gene carroll said there were no 
hitches as secret ballots were cast beginning at 8 am 
everything so far is going according to plan he said 
todays the day the membership decides the next step well abide 
by whatever they decide 
another union spokesman john duray aid results of the vote 
would be announced tuesday 
about 1700 striking miners who have been out of work for 10 
months in virginia west virginia and kentucky are voting on the 
proposed agreement in addition an undetermined number of laidoff 
miners still in good standing with the union also were expected to 
cast their votes 
coal industry analysts say the proposed contract between the umw 
and pittston coal group inc represents a compromise on both sides 
on a longterm basis if the contract is approved both the 
company and the union win said marc cohen a coal analyst for 
kidder peabody co in new york 
on the nearterm basis both sides lost a lot of money he 
added 
under the tentative agreement pittston would continue to pay 
100 percent of miners healthcare coverage rather than forcing 
the miners to take on 20 percent of those costs pittston also 
would continue paying into an industrywide pension fund from which 
it had withdrawn 
union job security would be enhanced by giving laidoff umw 
miners the first shot at many pittston nonunion jobs 
the company won the right to operate shifts around the clock 
union officials said a voluntary sunday daytime shift might be 
added 
the proposed settlement was reached jan 1 with the help of 
federal mediator william usery who was appointed by labor 
secretary elizabeth dole striking miners received copies of the 
pact friday 
last summer the pittston walkout touched off wildcat sympathy 
walkouts at other coal companies that had settled with the umw at 
their peak the wildcat strikes affected tens of thousands of 
miners in much of the east and midwest

thousands of ethnic albanians 
demonstrated today in yugoslavias restive kosovo province after 
hearing rumors about the release of one of the nations most 
prominent political prisoners 
the official tanjug news agency later denied the reports saying 
adem demaqi remained in jail and had not yet served out a 
15yearprison term he began in 1976 
gunfire was heard overnight in podujevo a town 20 miles north 
of this provincial capital as albanians fired into the air to 
celebrate the release of demaqi a dissident who has spent nearly 
29 years in jail for alleged separatist activity 
the release of demaqi was one of the main demands by 
participants in large demonstrations that shook the region last 
month during which at least 27 people died in clashes with riot 
police 
pristina radio reported sunday that authorities had released 
demaqi a 53yearold sociologist who has been imprisoned almost 
continuously since 1959 
more than 20000 people gathered to greet him in the village of 
ljupce near podujevo and thousands more were were proceeding there 
in hope of seeing him said sefki ukai a local reporter 
several hundred university students gathered early today around 
their dormitories in pristina chanting demaqi demaqi and 
victory victory

some 45 miles west of pristina chanting democracy democracy 
and demanding to speak to the authorities local journalist sources

throughout the province for week skirmished with police in several 
towns but no casualties or arrests were reported 
protesters are demanding free elections and greater autonomy for 
kosovo a province of 19 million people 90 percent of whom are of 
albanian origin 
the authorities in yugoslavias largest republic of serbia of 
which kosovo is an administrative part claim they must retain 
control over the province to prevent what they describe as 
harassment and persecution of the serbian minority there by 
ethnic albanians 
they accuse albanian terrorists and separatists of inciting 
unrest to allow kosovo to secede from yugoslavia and join 
neighboring albania 
in a related development the trial of 15 prominent ethnic 
albanians accused of engaging in counterrevolutionary activities 
was adjourned today because the father of one of the defense 
attorneys was killed during a clash friday between security forces 
and demonstrators 
if our lawyers and their kin are not safe then we will 
dismiss them all and defend ourselves azem vlasi a former 
communist party head of kosovo told the court in titova mitrovica 
30 miles north of pristina 
the trial which has been going on since last october was 
adjourned until next week vlasis wife told the associated press

parliament today failed to elect a head of 
state in its first round of voting after the conservative new 
democracy party abstained from the roll call 
the action made it impossible for incumbent president christos 
sartzetakis the only candidate in the first round to receive the 
necessary number of votes new democracy greeces largest 
political group said it would continue to abstain over the next 
two rounds of balloting 
a candidate for a fiveyear term in the largely ceremonial post 
of president must win at least 200 votes in the first two rounds of 
balloting in the 300member unicameral parliament and 180 votes in 
the third 
the conservatives hold 148 seats the socialists 128 and the 
communists 21 three seats belong to independents 
sartzetakis who is also expected to run unopposed in the next 
two rounds received 151 votes one parliamentarian was absent from 
the chamber 
house speaker athanasios tsaldaris said the second round will be 
held on sunday and the third on march 3 parties may propose 
different candidates in each round 
anticipating the deadlock parliament last week agreed to hold 
general elections on april 8 the first task of the new parliament 
will be to continue voting for a new president 
new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis said his party would 
pick its presidential candidate after general elections when fewer 
votes are required to win the balloting 
former premier andreas papandreous socialist party or pasok 
announced its preference for sartzetakis one hour before the vote 
started newspapers had speculated that melina mercouri a 
longtime socialist culture minister and actress might be a 
candidate 
sartzetakis was elected by the socialist and communist parties 
in 1985 and was proposed for reelection by the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress last week his term expires on 
march 29 
sartzetakis is a former supreme court judge who gained 
recognition as a prosecutor in 1963 when he investigated the murder 
of leftist deputy gregoris lambrakis by rightwing police 
officials the affair was later made into a film called z 
starring frances yves montand 
the presidential election became a formality this month when 
veteran statesman and former president constantine caramanlis 
turned down the candidacy offered by new democracy 
the party that caramanlis founded in 1974 when a sevenyear 
military dictatorship collapsed then said it would not back any 
candidate until after general elections 
party leaders are holding their cards close to their chest 
right now keeping them for the next rounds of voting senior 
socialist party official costas simitis said sunday

a new lava flow from kilauea volcano 
that entered an isolated hawaii island subdivision over the weekend 
has destroyed one vacant home and may have wiped out two other 
homes officials said 
hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim said it will 
be later today before officials can determine the extent of damage 
in royal gardens subdivision which has been devastated since 
kilaueas latest and longest eruption began in 1983 
a helicopter was used sunday night to evacuate two royal gardens 
residents whose homes were endangered by lava 
the fastmoving flow covering a half mile a day destroyed at 
least one home saturday the 75th in royal gardens and a 
neighboring subdivision since the series of eruptions began seven 
years ago kim said the home belonged to peter heeneman who left 
the subdivision in 1983

flows have cut the road into royal gardens access is limited to 
foot traffic or motorcycles

the un human rights commission today welcomed 
the release of nelson mandela but renewed its demand for sanctions 
against south africa with only the united states and britain 
opposing continued sanctions 
the resolution was backed by all 32 third world and east 
european members the nine other western countries on the panel 
abstained in the rollcall vote requested by west germany 
while welcoming mandelas release the commission merely took 
note of the lifting of the ban on antiapartheid organizations 
and condemned last septembers election as seeking to further 
entrench white supremacy 
otherwise the text with its new call for sanctions and its 
support for a continued antiapartheid struggle by all available 
means was largely identical with a resolution approved last year 
zola skweyiya an observer with the african national congress 
told the commission the measures announced by president frederik w 
de klerk on feb 2 fell far too short in meeting the fundamental 
requirements for free political activity and the abolition of 
torture 
mandela a leader of the african national congress said today 
he urgently wanted to speak to prime minister margaret thatcher by 
telephone about her wish to ease sanctions against south africa 
my intention is to phone and speak to the british premier on 
this question he said in a television interview with britains 
tvam from his home in soweto south africa 
mrs thatcher wants to ease commonwealth and european community 
sanctions to encourage south african reforms and prevent a backlash 
by the countrys white minority 
mandela declined to say when he would telephone mrs thatcher

a routine security camera videotape will be 
scrutinized for clues to the bombing of two grocery stores in this 
wealthy atlanta suburb the police chief said today 
there was only minor damage and no injuries when the bombs 
detonated saturday in a kroger and a cub foods store the bombs 
misfired the detonators fired but did not trigger large 
explosions fbi spokesman pat johnson said 
investigators found absolutely no connection between the 
bombings and the unsolved bombings that killed an alabama judge and 
a savannah lawyer last december according to thomas w stokes an 
agent with the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
roswell police chief jerry king said today that authorities had 
no suspects no leads at all federal investigators from other 
regions were called in to help local authorities 
because a small bank is inside the kroger store king said 
there is a videotape showing everyone entering and leaving that 
store authorities will view that tape and look for anybody 
looking suspicious or carrying a strangelooking package he said 
king said the two bombs were basically identical it was not a 
pipe bomb he said it wasnt anything that sophisticated 
the two stores that were bombed and two others that were 
evacuated after bomb threats saturday were open and did a brisk 
business sunday but police in cobb county atlanta and college 
park reported that bomb threats apparently from copycat callers 
were phoned to three supermarkets on sunday each store was 
evacuated but no bombs were found 
no one has called claiming credit its fairly wide open 
saying what the motive is stokes said 
he said the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms had 
requested an additional eight to 10 agents from bureaus outside 
atlanta and they were expected to arrive today 
at this point we dont even know why someone would want to 
do this king said 
stokes would not comment on what investigators may have learned 
from the evidence saying that might give other people ideas

east germanys communist premier said today 
he refuses to beg west germany for aid on my knees and said 
claims by bonn officials that his country faces imminent economic 
collapse were irresponsible 
premier hans modrow speaking at the weekly talks between the 
government and opposition groups made the remarks in a report on 
the results of his twoday visit to bonn last week 
chancellor helmut kohls government rejected modrows request 
for immediate aid of 9 billion to help east germanys struggling 
economy 
kohl made it clear west germany would provide billions of 
dollars to improve living conditions in east germany but said he 
would wait until a democratically elected government takes over 
after march 18 elections 
i can understand the disappointment of many east german 
citizens modrow told the session but my government cannot do 
more than it is already trying to do 
i will not go down on my knees to beg for such a show of 
solidarity from the bonn government he said 
he also criticized what he called irresponsible comments by 
one of kohls top advisers last week that east germany would soon 
be unable to pay its bills and that the march 18 election may have 
to be moved up because of instability 
i reprimanded this irresponsibility in bonn modrow said 
but we did not get an official explanation or apology 
both german governments had quickly denied such a collapse was 
imminent though about 2000 east germans continue to flee westward 
daily despite reformist moves since hardline leader erich honecker 
was ousted in october 
meanwhile in bonn the defense and foreign ministers today 
agreed that neither west german nor other nato troops should be 
stationed in what is now east german territory if the two countries 
reunite 
the joint statement issued by defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher moved 
toward settling a dispute that rocked kohls centerright coalition 
government over the weekend 
the two ministers who belong to different coalition parties 
reached agreement after meeting at kohls request earlier 
stoltenberg had insisted that german troops placed under nato 
command should be deployed throughout german territory as part of 
the alliances security umbrella for the newly united nation 
the dispute was over whether a united germanys relationship 
will belong to nato a move already rejected by the soviet union 
the western allies want a reunited germany to remain in nato while 
the soviet union has insisted that a new state should be neutral 
west germany has about 490000 soldiers while east germany has 
170000 in addition 380000 soviet troops are stationed in east 
germany while nato has more than 300000 soldiers in west germany 
the west germans reportedly have promised to cut their forces by 
about 100000 east germany would disband its army as part of the 
twostage plan for german reunification agreed on last week by the 
four world war ii allies according to a statement last week by 
david shorr an analyst at the britishamerican security 
information council in washington 
with the dispute over the role of nato cooling down the debate 
over polands western borders heated up today with an association 
of west germans germans forced to leave former german land 
declaring they will not give up their claims on silesia 
kohls failure to clearly recognize polands border has led 
warsaw to demand to be included in talks on german unification

amnesty international appealed monday to moroccos 
king hassan to intervene personally to end human rights abuses that 
it said have persisted for many years in his country 
the worldwide human rights organization said it was concerned 
about the reported torture and disappearances of political suspects 
while in custody prolonged detentions without outside contact and 
unfair trials 
the appeal followed a meeting with the king and talks with 
senior government officials in marrakesh and rabat last week it 
accompanied a report calling on the moroccan government to review 
its detention procedures especially a form of police custody known 
as garde a vue kept from sight 
amnesty international said its delegation also raised with the 
king concerns about continued incommunicado detention of some 
military officers after their prison sentences expired and the 
longterm detention of prisoners of conscience it said one family 
has been held without trial since 1972 
amnesty international said it sent a copy of its report to the 
government of morocco before last weeks meetings and discussed it 
with the countrys ministers of interior and justice and a 
specially constituted commission of highranking officials and 
magistrates 
the commission submitted a written response but amnesty 
international said neither the response nor the discussions settled 
its concerns 
however it said it welcomed the governments willingness to 
engage in a prompt and detailed examination of its concerns and 
to receive another amnesty international delegation within one 
month 
the moroccan response released by amnesty international noted 
the government was a signatory to international human rights 
accords and said it was vigilant about investigating allegations of 
human rights abuses 
amnesty international said only one in five alleged deaths after 
torture in 1989 is known to have been investigated and the findings 
were not disclosed 
garde a vue allows police to detain suspects for 
interrogation without referring the cases to the judiciary 
suspects held in such conditions are not allowed to see relatives 
lawyers or independent doctors amnesty international said 
after interrogation they must sign a police statement before 
being brought before a magistrate it said while waiting they are 
often tortured to extract false confessions or as punishment it 
said 
the legal time limit on such detention is frequently exceeded 
arrest dates are falsified on police statements and extensions 
granted without the suspect being brought before a court amnesty 
international said 
the torture and illtreatment inflicted in police stations and 
secret detention centers especially in casablanca included being 
bound blindfolded and forbidden to talk for weeks or months 
according to the report 
it quoted former detainees as saying the soles of their feet 
were beaten they were nearly suffocated by having their heads 
plunged into buckets of water mud or excrement and were suspended 
in contorted positions

fighting alone to relax south african sanctions 
and evoking world war ii memories over german reunification prime 
minister margaret thatcher appears at her most isolated 
internationally 
critics including some of her own supporters and 
proconservative newspapers accuse her of forfeiting britains 
influence in a fastchanging europe and in a postapartheid south 
africa by clinging to outdated attitudes 
thatcher aides argue that on germany she says out loud what 
others believe on south africa they say it is her policy of 
seeking to encourage not punish the white rulers that has helped 
bring reforms and the feb 11 release of nelson mandela 
the storm over mrs thatchers foreign policy and charges of 
cold war nostalgia have blown up amid mounting government 
unpopularity on domestic issues particularly because of soaring 
interest rates and a controversial new property tax 
trailing in opinion polls for the last nine months the 
conservatives slumped to a 15year low behind the socialist labor 
party in the two latest surveys this month by gallup and icm both 
showed labor with about 50 percent support and the tories 15 points 
behind 
at a meeting in dublin on tuesday britain will try to get the 
12nation european community to lift a ban on new investment in 
south africa if the others refuse to budge britain has indicated 
it may break ranks 
if we fail to reach agreement then the government must 
reserve its right to act on its own if necessary foreign 
secretary douglas hurd said during angry exchanges in the house of 
commons last week 
retorted labors foreign affairs spokesman gerald kaufman to 
be alone in the world and right is heroic but to be alone in the 
world and wrong is futile and destructive 
he was shouted down by conservative party legislators but there 
were signs of unease among the governing party rankandfile and 
several urged that britain stick with the rest of the community 
over sanctions 
on german reunification britain welcomed last weeks agreement 
providing for the united states the soviet union britain and 
france conquerors of nazi germany in world war ii and the two 
germanys to agree on the external repercussions 
but mrs thatcher continues to sound cautious 
in a speech to britains jewish leaders sunday she said one 
germany was inevitable but added it is understandable that for 
some bitter memories of the past should color their view of the 
present and future 
last week mrs thatcher sympathized with polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowieckis fears about polands borders which include 
prewar german territories britain and poland she said shared 
experiences this century which we are determined should not 
happen again 
londons proconservative sunday times accused mrs thatcher of 
consummate folly to give the germans the impression that the 
british government is at best grudging in its support for the 
reunification of the two parts of their nation and at worst 
hostile 
another usually staunch thatcher supporter londons daily 
express complained in an editorial monday surely 45 years 
after the end of world war ii we can accept this momentous 
event german reunification with something more imaginative and 
generous than public foreboding 
mrs thatcher has been isolated abroad before and often this has 
proved a votewinner at home such as her battles in the 1980s in 
the european community over money and frenchinspired grandiose 
plans for closer unity 
even when polls have shown little voter support for an issue 
such as her backing of president reagans bombing of libya in 1986 
she has won praise for courage and honesty 
criticism of her foreign policy is heightened by a widespread 
perception in britain that since president bush took over the 
special relationship with the united states has waned thatcher 
aides deny this

interim president ion iliescu today 
threatened to severely punish the leaders of a violent 
demonstration in which hundreds of angry protesters smashed windows 
and invaded government headquarters 
down with iliescu demonstrators shouted sunday as they took 
over the headquarters on victory square used by prime minister 
petre roman since communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was ousted 
it was the most violent protest since the december revolution 
the only solution is another revolution the protesters 
shouted 
in a message broadcast on state radio iliescu said he ordered 
an investigation to identify the protest leaders whom he described 
as circles interested in destabilizing the situation in our 
country and restoring the vestiges of the dictatorial regime of 
ceausescu 
iliescu charged the protest was not a demonstration by those 
who want to rescue the revolution but they were 
counterrevolutionaries 
those who violate the law must be severely punished because 
they commit acts against national interests iliescu said he did 
not say what would happen to the protest leaders if they are caught 
more than 1000 people cheered as protesters smashed the windows 
and glassandmetal doors of the headquarters using rocks and iron 
carpet rods about 500 people poured in and destroyed part of the 
rooms and furniture 
hundreds of extra soldiers arrived after the takeover and pushed 
back the crowd which grew to around 5000 before dwindling to 
about 100 ten armored personnel carriers were wheeled to the front 
of the building 
the army blocked the entrance after allowing many demonstrators 
to leave 
scores of national salvation front supporters launched a small 
counterdemonstration outside the building housing iliescus 
office yelling terrorists terrorists 
government spokesman dan radulescu said 120 demonstrators were 
detained questioned and then released without being charged 
he said the police took down statements as to who sent them 
and why they were there but aded they were mostly drunk and 
they were released and probably will not be investigated any 
further 
the crowd had demanded that iliescu step down saying the 
government was dominated by communists from the despised ceausescu 
leadership ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 and executed three 
days later following a summary trial 
opposition to the national salvation front which took power 
following decembers revolution and includes several former 
communists has been evident almost since ceausescus fall 
the romanian state news agency rompres reported more than 20 
paratroopers were severely wounded in sundays occupation and 
romanian state tv showed what it said were injured paratroopers in 
a hospital late sunday but radulescu said only three or four 
soldiers were injured crushed by the mob 
workmen removed the debris around the government headquarters 
today and set new glass panes into the dozens of ornate windows and 
doorways destroyed by the demonstrators 
the front of the building was blocked by 12 armored personnel 
carriers and surrounded by 300 soldiers including sharpshooters 
in his statement broadcast from the meeting of the 21member 
executive bureau iliescu said it was regrettable that this 
happens just as our political situation gave us reason for hope 
the executive bureau is the decisionmaking body of romanias 
253member multiparty council of national unity which will serve 
as the legislative organ until elections scheduled for may 20 
the council of national unity which was formed earlier this 
month in the wake of considerable popular pressure for the front to 
share power is to lead romania until general elections scheduled 
for may 20 
it includes representatives of 37 political parties and interest 
groups as well as the front which critics claim still maintains 
control 
in paris interim romanian prime minister petre roman said the 
protesters represented an insignificant number of romanians and 
that officials in bucharest assured him all was in order 
earlier he told reporters that recent protests were the product 
of a population coming to grips with democracy after decades of 
harsh totalitarian ruleits a lack of confidence in democracy 
he said 
the only government official in the building at the time of the 
takeover sunday was vice prime minister gelu voican voiculescu 
iliescu recently moved his office to the old grand national 
assembly building several miles away 
at one point demonstrators found voiculescu and dragged him 
onto the balcony where he was jeered soldiers moved in and hustled 
him to his office which they locked and guarded from hundreds of 
demonstrators yelling voican voican 
an army colonel said that authorities did not issue orders to 
shoot 
if we had gotten an order to fire we would have fired and 
finished this off in two seconds he said on condition of 
anonymity 
the opposition says the front seeks a return to oneparty rule 
in romania which lacks a democratic tradition ceausescu brutally 
suppressed opposition during his 24year rule carrying on the 
intolerance of his predecessors in postwar communist romania 
longdormant political parties whose leaders spent decades in 
exile or prison thus face formidable obstacles in organizing 
campaigns to challenge the provisional government which controls 
the broadcast media the military and all major industry

prime minister toshiki kaifu said monday the voters 
gave his party a vote of confidence in its time of greatest crisis 
by keeping the liberal democrats in control of parliament 
some japanese who voted sunday said they were angry with the 
liberal democrats because of political scandal and an unpopular 
sales tax but still were not ready to entrust the government to the 
opposition socialists 
business leaders called the result a vote for the economic 
policies that have brought unprecedented prosperity to japan 
liberal democrats implicated in the recruit influencebuying 
scandal were reelected including former prime ministers yasuhiro 
nakasone 72 and noboru takeshita 65 nakasone ran as an 
independent 
kaifu said they were absolved by the voters but added we 
must proceed with political reforms in the party that has 
governed japan since its founding in 1955 
we started when the party was said to be in the greatest 
crisis since it was formed he told reporters the result of 
the election is a vote of confidence of the people under the 
constitution and our government has passed it 
socialist party leader takako doi also claimed a victory on 
grounds that our purpose was to reduce the liberal democrats 
strength as much as possible 
her party campaigned on opposition to the 3 percent sales tax 
introduced last year and reminded voters of the scandal in which 
the recruit co information and publishing conglomerate made large 
contributions to politicians and sold them stock at insider prices 
ms doi said nakasone takashita and others touched by the 
scandal won reelection to parliament because of their powerful 
political machines 
the liberal democrats got 275 seats in parliaments powerful 
lower house a 512seat body that chooses the prime minister and 
sets the budget fourteen more candidates who ran as independents 
are expected to join them before the election the party had 295 
seats 
when the liberal democrats reached 271 seats monday morning 
giving the party control of all committees in the lower house 
kaifu filled in the blank eye of a papiermache daruma doll in 
a traditional ceremony signifying fulfillment of a wish 
socialists won 136 seats up from 83 
liberal democrats won 303 million votes or 461 percent of the 
total down from 494 percent in the last lower house election in 
1986 socialists took 16 million votes or 244 percent a sharp 
increase from 172 percent in 1986 
hideo sato dean of international relations at tsukuba 
university said in an interview the liberal democrats won because 
socialists and other opposition parties were not able to provide 
substantive arguments in terms of specific policies they were just 
parroting their opposition to the consumption tax 
one scandaltainted candidate who lost was kunio takaishi a 
former vice minister of education who benefitted from lowpriced 
shares of a recruit subsidiary and is being tried on bribery 
charges he ran as an independent 
on sunday police arrested a ranking aide to takaishi on 
suspicion of buying votes 
a total of 23 people were arrested on suspicion of election law 
violations and 19 of the cases involved vote buying a national 
police agency official said 
rei shiratori chairman of the political science department at 
tokai university said the recruit scandal had faded somewhat and 
noted that many voters already had expressed their feelings in 
elections last july ousting the liberal democrats from control of 
the less powerful upper house 
kaifu 59 said of his party each candidate worked as if he 
were crawling on the ground and i think people gave us credit for 
that 
the prime ministers position had appeared shaky because of his 
weak personal power base in the party and doubts about the liberal 
democrats chances on monday kaifu said he would serve out his 
twoyear term as party president and pledged to fulfill his 
election promises 
one of japans major newspapers asahi said in an editorial 
tuesday the liberal democrats should not be allowed to shelve 
their campaign promise of reforming the political system and forget 
the lessons of the recruit influencepeddling scandal 
the ills of using huge amounts of money on the campaign 
worsened in the recent election it said the ldp should 
seriously revise its political structure 
ms doi said her party would continue working for repeal of the 
sales tax but acknowledged the election results showed that in 
a sense we have not obtained a majority toward abolishing the 
tax 
the liberal democrats have promised to ease the sales tax on 
groceries and some other items

defense secretary dick cheney 
shunned by philippine president corazon aquino told filipino 
officials monday that the united states will abandon its bases here 
if it finds that keeping them is too expensive or that americans 
are unwelcome 
as violence was reported in several clashes between leftist 
protesters and police near us installations cheney met for 
nearly three hours with defense minister fidel ramos in discussions 
that were described as very cordial very forthright 
meeting reporters afterward with ramos cheney said the united 
states will stay only as long as the philippine people wish it to 
say and only if the terms negotiated are acceptable to both 
parties 
at issue in mondays discussions was a 96 million cut congress 
made in the bush administrations request of 360 million to 
compensate the philippines for the six bases which include two of 
the united states largest overseas installations clark air base 
and subic bay naval base 
we recognize there is a shortfall of 96 million over what we 
had anticipated cheney said i also pointed out that in east 
asia in this part of the world the united states provided a 
little over 600 million and about 500 million of that comes 
specifically to the philippines 
cheney has said his discussions with filipino officials did not 
amount to the beginning of negotiations to extend the base 
agreement which expires next year 
an influential filipino minority is pressuring mrs aquino not 
to renew the agreement in addition leading filipino congressmen 
have urged her to postpone those discussions until this years cuts 
are restored 
there are some 18000 us military personnel in the 
philippines plus 20000 dependents 
for his part ramos acknowledged that the bush administration 
needs congressional approval for aid commitments but said he had 
told cheney that time is of the essence in meeting current us 
obligations the secretary said ramos had been very direct and 
very forthright in presenting his governments position 
mrs aquino was so upset over the congressional cut that she 
announced before cheney began his twoweek tour of asian nations 
hosting us bases that she would not see him leaving that task to 
her defense minister 
the secretary pledged his best efforts to restoring the 96 
million cut but us diplomats have said that an austerityminded 
congress is unlikely to change its mind 
despite the current differences cheney said that ties between 
the two nations are strong 
i think that is a misreading of events to suggest that 
somehow the united states is trying to send signals other than the 
one i have already given publicly which is our very strong 
commitment to our alliance with the philippines the secretary 
said 
when asked whether he could say that his government wanted the 
base to remain ramos declined to answer the question saying the 
issue was under discussion in the philippine congress 
after the talks with ramos cheney flew to the subic bay base 
50 miles west of manila to inspect a helicopter carrier and to 
chat with a group of marines and sailors 
while there were no reports of violence at subic bay about 300 
militants hurled rocks at police trying to stop them from 
dismantling barbed wire barricades at the entrance to clark 
demonstrators said about 30 students had been injured the 
protesters regrouped later and staged an indignation rally 
accusing philippine police of being puppets of us imperialism 
in manila about 200 members of the militant league of filipino 
students chanting yankees go home marched to the us embassy 
and hurled bottles and rotten tomatoes at police who charged with 
clubs and tear gas 
one student was arrested and at least four policemen were 
injured in the protest which occurred near cheneys heavily 
guarded hotel 
earlier about 50 students burned an effigy of cheney and 
picketed the military headquarters garrison with banners reading 
cheney warmonger go home and white monkey go home with your 
bases 
cheney who is to leave the philippines on tuesday for okinawa 
and tokyo is due to head back to washington on saturday 
he is touring the asian nations with us bases in preparation 
for an april 1 assessment he is to give congress on the nations 
military posture in the pacific 
he has been telling officials in each nation that there is a 
limit to the pentagon pocketbook and that budget pressures may 
force 10 percent to 12 percent cutbacks in us military forces 
based in japan south korea and the philippines

the debate in japan over the recruit scandal hasnt 
ended even after a national election in which most of the 
politicians tainted by the influencepeddling case won seats in 
parliament 
people are asking whether the most heavily tainted politicians 
can return to the inner circle of power and whether japanese 
voters tolerate too much corruption 
but the question of whether the governing liberal democratic 
party survived its worst postwar scandal was a firm yes 
it won a strong albeit reduced majority in the powerful lower 
house of parliament on sunday and leaders claimed this proved the 
people had accepted its apologies and promises of reform 
in prime minister toshiki kaifus view the vote was a form of 
purification 
the opposition disagreed socialist chairwoman takako doi 
attributed the reelection of recruittainted figures to powerful 
political machines 
but rei shiratori dean of the political science faculty of 
tokai university said the scandal had limited impact because it 
was almost two years old and no longer headline news 
many voters had used up their anger by voting against the 
liberal democrats in julys election for the less powerful upper 
house of parliament said shiratori 
still voters sunday punished virtually all of the 
scandaltouched politicians by giving them fewer votes than in the 
previous election the candidates scraped through thanks to the 
japanese system of multiseat constituencies shiratori said 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone for instance who 
resigned from the party in disgrace last year had been a strong 
votegetter for many terms in his gunma prefecture constituency 
the constituency has four seats and though nakasone did not win 
nearly as many votes as in previous years he managed to place 
third and captured a seat nakasone asserted he had been absolved 
kaifu who pledges political reform every time he gives a 
speech was asked at a news conference monday whether the party 
would welcome back the 72yearold nakasone and takao fujinami 57 
nakasones onetime chief cabinet secretary who is on trial for 
bribery in connection with the recruit affair both ran as 
independents 
kaifu said the voters had issued their verdict by reelecting 
nakasone and fujinami but that doesnt mean they will be 
unconditionally accepted by the party the ldp as a party has been 
pushing for political reforms 
in addition the liberal democrats do not need the votes of 
nakasone and fujinami to form a majority in the 512seat lower 
house as they won 275 outright and there are other conservative 
independents to call upon if needed 
the recruit scandal erupted in the summer of 1988 in less than 
a year it sent the liberal democrats popularity plummeting amid 
disclosures that the recruit co an informationservices 
conglomerate had lavished huge political donations and cutprice 
share deals on leading politicians news media executives 
businessmen and bureaucrats to buy influence the share deals 
occurred while nakasone was prime minister 
dozens of prominent officials resigned with careers in tatters 
and two politicians six bureaucrats and four recruit executives 
are being tried for giving or accepting bribes 
noboru takeshita resigned as prime minister last spring after 
admitting accepting 13 million in donations from recruit he 
too was reelected sunday and is widely held to be pulling the 
strings behind kaifu who had no personal power base when he was 
vaulted from obscurity into the premiership 
columbia university professor gerald l curtis asked at a 
meeting with foreign journalists whether japanese voters have a 
high tolerance for corruption said it was at least partially true 
voters believe most politicians are corrupt and may think those 
who have been caught are simply unlucky deserving of a sympathy 
vote curtis said 
curtis said an anticorruption climate is building in japan but 
it has not completely taken over 
he recounted a campaign meeting last month where the host 
introduced the incumbent candidate by saying he wasnt involved 
in recruit but please dont hold that against him he has good 
connections with the business community

foreign minister moshe arens has caused a storm 
with his cautious embrace of german reunification cabinet 
ministers demanded he be rebuked and newspaper editorials accuse 
him of fostering a fourth reich 
prime minister yitzhak shamir remained silent monday in a 
continuing debate that illustrates the dilemma posed for israel by 
the prospect of a reunited germany 
israeli leaders cannot afford to alienate west germany the 
staunchest supporter of the jewish state in the european community 
but they also must consider the emotions of the many israelis whose 
relatives were among the 6 million jews killed by the nazis 
we are still pondering the consequences of reunification 
senior shamir aide avi pazner told the associated press on monday 
the prime minister has concerns about such a possibility but has 
not taken a stand opposing it 
arens a shamir protege in the rightwing likud bloc started 
the trouble last week by saying on a visit to bonn that he had 
confidence in the democratic traditions of west germany and 
viewed extending democracy to east germany as a positive step 
after the criticism began arens pointed out that most of his 
family perished in the holocaust sundays edition of the newspaper 
maariv quoted arens who was born in lithuania as saying if i 
wasnt foreign minister today my feet wouldnt touch german soil 
arens suggested however that israel could not afford to 
disrupt ties with west germany and noted that bonn had promised 
help in blocking further european community sanctions against 
israel the sanctions were imposed to protest the treatment of 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
before his comments in the west german capital arens said in 
israel that if a united germany is a democratic germany a 
germany that is fully conscious of the responsibility that it has 
to the jewish people then i dont think there is a danger to be 
concerned about 
the text of the speech was sent to israeli embassies around the 
world to serve as a guide for diplomats 
in the weekly cabinet meeting sunday environment minister roni 
milo a confidant of shamir demanded that the government adopt a 
resolution against german reunification 
the generation that experienced the holocaust is still 
alive milo said on army radio a united germany should not be 
supported by a jewish state and a jewish government 
milo won support from communications minister gad yaacobi of the 
rival centerleft labor party 
most newspaper editorials on the subject were critical of arens 
no other country has welcomed in such an unreserved fashion 
the first steps toward the formation of a fourth reich and a new 
hitler maariv said just the state of the jews and its foreign 
minister had to jump to the head of the line

the body of a journalist for an 
international news agency washed ashore on a beach monday police 
said two days after he was abducted at gunpoint from his home by 
six men 
the body of richard de zoysa 33 was found at the moratuwa 
beach just south of colombo police officials said on condition of 
anonymity 
de zoysas mother identified the body which bore a gunshot 
wound in the neck the officials said the reporters body was 
apparently thrown into the sea after he was shot they said 
de zoysa who workd for the inter press service news agency was 
reported abducted from his home saturday family members said at 
least one of the men who took him away wore a police uniform 
police said the journalist was not arrested by their men they 
said they suspected he was taken by sinhalese militants who have 
been trying to overthrow the government 
de zoysas family said a military official initially told them 
the reporter was taken in for questioning but later the family was 
told he was not being held by the army 
defense secretary gen cyril ranatunga had denied the reporter 
was in military custody but also said he doubted de zoysa was 
abducted by extremists 
de zoysa wrote several articles on the sinhalese uprising for 
sri lankan newspapers 
inter press service is headquartered in rome and has 
correspondents in many capitals around the world 
authorities blamed sinhalese extremists of the peoples 
liberation front for the killings of three employees of the 
stateowned television station last year 
since 1987 when the sinhalese began their uprising at least 
6000 people have been killed by the militants or by security 
forces in retaliation 
sinhalese radicals began attacking the sinhalesedominated 
government when it tried to make peace with tamil rebels who are 
fighting for autonomy in the north and east the extremists contend 
the government has made too many concessions to the minority tamils 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people claim they are denied jobs and education by the sinhalese 
who make up 75 percent of the population

the weather isnt the only thing behaving 
strangely this winter the economy has been topsyturvy as well 
in just two months december and january many economists went 
from predicting an impending economic downturn to believing that 
the longest peacetime expansion in history has found another of its 
nine lives 
the new general consensus of moderate economic growth this year 
is likely to be an important element in federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspans testimony before congress tuesday when he reveals 
the feds policy targets for 1990 these targets will have a major 
influence on interest rates and economic growth 
greenspan could be excused for expressing a certain amount of 
perplexity about recent events 
in december the economic outlook was as bleak as the unusually 
cold weather housing construction plunged christmas sales were 
lackluster and the overall economy as measured by the gross 
national product turned in its worst showing in 3 years 
all that gloom prompted recession worries as economists feared 
the impending demise of the sevenyearold economic recovery an 
expansion that has already lasted almost five times longer than 
usual 
but in january the weather warmed and so did the economy 
housing construction soared 296 percent the biggest monthly 
increase on record retail sales rebounded largely on the strength 
of a pickup in auto demand and the economy produced 275000 new 
jobs almost triple the december increase 
the good news chased away the recession forecasts some analysts 
now look for 3 percent annual growth in the januarymarch quarter 
six times the pace from october through december 
the economy is doing a lot better than a lot of people thought 
it would said michael k evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm everything we have seen so far this year has been strong 
part of the rebound is almost certainly weatherrelated the 
warmest january on record spurred business activity which had been 
depressed in december 
but evans and many of his colleagues believe that even taking 
account of januarys weather the economy is staging a modest 
revival from the depressed fourth quarter 
greenspan in an unusually candid comment said that the chance 
of a recession had diminished markedly since last spring and that 
the fourth quarters sluggish growth was likely to prove only a 
temporary hesistation 
economists believe greenspan will restate those views tuesday 
and are not looking for any immediate credit easing on the part of 
the central bank especially in light of current inflationary 
pressures 
in january wholesale prices surged upward at an annual rate of 
more than 24 percent the fastest clip since the oil shock of the 
early 1970s analysts are expecting a similarly worrisome increase 
in januarys consumer prices which will be released wednesday 
while the inflation spike can be explained by temporary factors 
such as the december freeze which drove food prices higher 
economists said the fed would still find the pace too troublesome 
to ignore 
the fed does not want to be perceived as easing at a time when 
inflation is accelerating even if those inflationary pressures 
were considered to be temporary said david jones chief 
economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer 
that could set up a potential clash with the bush 
administration which has been complaining over the last year that 
the greenspanled fed has not been aggressive enough in pushing 
interest rates down to spur economic growth 
in addition to releasing the feds 1990 targets for growth of 
the money supply which influences interest rates greenspan will 
also reveal the feds economic forecast for the year 
the bush administration in the forecast on which it based its 
1991 budget projected that the economy would expand at a 26 
percent rate this year 
the administrations forecast which has been attacked as wildly 
optimistic by democrats in congress also calls for interest rates 
to fall sharply 
by forecasting faster growth and lower interest rates the 
administration was able to meet the 1991 budget deficit target 
without having to raise taxes or make even steeper cuts in federal 
programs 
many economists believe the central bank will stick to a 
preliminary forecast made last july in which the bank estimated 
that growth for 1990 would be in a weak range of between 15 
percent to 2 percent 
the federal reserve has a lot of influence on economic growth 
through its power over interest rates economists believe a lower 
growth forecast would be a warning that the fed still believes 
inflation is too high to loosen credit further something the 
administration would not like to hear in an electionyear 
the public comments from the administration will be coming hot 
and heavy later on this year as bush officials try to nudge the fed 
into an easier stance jones predicted

a palestinian was found stabbed to death in a 
west bank refugee camp monday the fifth victim slain in a week on 
suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities arab reports 
said 
throughout the occupied west bank and gaza strip palestinians 
staged a general strike to protest the immigration of soviet jews 
to israel and their possible settlement in the occupied territories 
most shops were closed and many workers stayed home under orders 
from the plobacked leadership of the 26monthold uprising against 
israels occupation 
the soviet immigration to palestine is a threat to world 
peace said a slogan spraypainted on a wall in the west bank 
city of nablus it was signed by the palestinian communist party 
plobacked uprising leaders also complained in a leaflet 
ordering mondays strike that soviet immigration and settlement in 
the occupied territories could hinder peace 
while israel is expecting up to 300000 soviet immmigrants in 
the next three years because of liberalized soviet exit policies 
israeli leaders deny they are trying to settle the immigrants in 
the territories 
also monday an israeli official said us and israeli diplomats 
were trying to arrange a meeting between secretary of state james 
a baker iii and foreign minister moshe arens to discuss middle 
east peace 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity the meeting 
could be held friday with arens stopping in washington on his way 
back from a visit to mexico 
baker has proposed a joint meeting with arens and egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid as a step toward an 
israelipalestinian dialogue 
in the alamari refugee camp near ramallah residents said 
hussein hamad abu radwan 35 an alleged collaborator was slain 
during the night after being kidnapped sunday 
he was stabbed to death and his body was dumped near the camps

radwan was the 187th palestinian killed by fellow arabs since 
the uprising began in december 1987 and the fifth killed in seven 
days 
in addition 657 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians and 43 israelis have been slain by 
palestinians during the uprising 
palestinians maintain that most victims are informers or 
collaborate in other ways the plo has urged restraint in executing 
alleged collaborators ordering that suspects be tried and given a 
chance to repent before being killed

prime minister toshiki kaifu looked like a shaky 
leader before the election but he now is strengthened after his 
party captured a strong majority in the lower house of parliament 
analysts say 
also helped by sundays balloting however was kaifus main 
opponent socialist party chairwoman takako doi whose party far 
outpaced other opposition parties moving from 83 seats before the 
election to 136 
ms doi 61 vowed to continue her struggles against the 
conservative governing party and appeared to have ways to stir 
trouble in parliament 
and the prime minister breaking away from cautious comment 
declared now we have to carry out the promises we made and i am 
determined to lead the effort 
the strengthening of the two opposing leaders may seem like a 
curious outcome to a hardfought national election but it derives 
from both the relatively low expectations of kaifu and the 
fragmented nature of the opposition in japans political spectrum 
kaifu 59 emerged from obscurity to become prime minister in 
august when the liberal democrats were on the ropes from the 
resignations of two prime ministers amid sex and money scandals 
and a big loss in the july election for the upper house of 
parliament 
he came from a small faction in the party had no personal 
clout and looked as if he could easily be the scapegoat if 
anything went wrong 
six months later kaifus personal clout is still to be 
measured but nothing has gone terribly wrong 
instead with the 275 seats his liberal democratic party won 
outright and 14 conservative independents likely to join it in the 
lower house the party is not far behind the 295 seats it held 
before the election 
its not going to be as easy to get rid of kaifu as some of 
the ldp leaders thought it would be said professor gerald curtis 
of columbia university 
curtis said at the foreign correspondents club of japan that 
kaifus leadership will be tested soon in usjapan trade 
negotiations and it was possible he might misstep and become 
vulnerable again 
the chances that he will stay around for another year or year 
and a half have surely improved the asia specialist said 
if kaifu stumbles a more powerful figure within the liberal 
democratic party former foreign minister shintaro abe is widely 
thought to be preparing to try to replace him 
rei shiratori dean of the political science faculty at tokai 
university told the same meeting he thought former prime minister 
noboru takeshita was manipulating kaifu from behind the scenes and 
if kaifu became too strong takeshita would seek to remove him 
shiratori said he thought kaifu would last at least until december 
though the opposition fell far short of ousting the liberal 
democrats in the lower house it holds a majority in the upper 
house which though less powerful still must give its assent to 
most bills passed by the lower house 
the socialists lead three centrist parties in that upper house 
majority which may be used to block essential government 
legislation like enabling bills for the budget or measures to deal 
with usjapan trade problems 
ms doi conceded that the oppositions main campaign theme of 
demanding abolition of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax had failed 
but she declared the effort would continue 
well carry out what we promised during the campaign in 
cooperation with other opposition parties she said 
the other parties however distrust the socialists and they 
lost seats in the lower house while the socialists advanced giving 
the centrists even more reason to try to rein in ms dois party 
curtis said the socialists had done well in the election mainly 
on ms dois appeal which drew issueoriented housewives into 
party activism but he said the party still needed to distance 
itself from leftist dogma if it is to become a true alternative to 
the liberal democrats and he was pessimistic that she could change 
the old party line

the united states is holding its own in the 
race against japan to develop the new superconductors which could 
be in commercial use within five years a panel of experts said 
monday 
next year the united states will for the first time launch 
simple superconducting devices into space to determine how well the 
devices survive 
communications equipment using superconductors would be much 
lighter than conventional equipment and thus ideal for use in outer 
space where the costs of launching climb enormously as weight 
increases said edward mead of ei du pont de nemours amp co in 
wilmington del 
the weight and size savings would be dramatic up there he 
said 
mead said the united states and japan are neckandneck in the 
race to develop the new superconductors which were discovered in 
january 1987 
he spoke at the annual meeting of the american association for 
the advancement of science 
conventional superconductors conduct electricity without 
resistance at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero which 
is equal to about 460 degrees below zero fahrenheit the new 
superconductors operate at the comparatively warmer temperatures of 
liquid nitrogen about 321 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
that increases the potential applications of superconductors 
because liquid nitrogen is inexpensive and widely available in 
industry 
in space it may be possible to achieve that temperature 
without refrigeration mead said 
japan is focusing its efforts on superconductors containing 
bismuth one of several classes of the socalled hightemperature 
superconductors mead said the japanese believe the bismuth 
compounds are the most promising he said 
if theyre right that would put them in a position far ahead 
of us he said if they are wrong however they could all go 
off the edge of a cliff 
most of the support for the japanese effort comes from industry 
in the united states twothirds of the support for 
superconductivity research comes from the government mead said 
that includes the support of the national weapons laboratories 
for 40 years theyve been the most secret places in the world 
and now theyre cooperating and sharing information mead said 
japan and the united states are each spending about 250 million 
per year on superconductivity research mead said far more than 
any other nations 
paul chu of the university of houston said that superconducting 
devices could be in use within five years in oil and mineral 
exploration 
devices called superconducting quantum interference devices or 
squids can detect very weak electromagnetic fields chu said 
the new superconductors will make it possible to use these 
devices to search for the telltale underground variations in 
electromagnetic fields that indicate the presence of oil or 
minerals chu said 
large applications such as transmission lines and magnetically 
levitated trains are 10 to 15 years away chu said and the 
japanese are ahead on those 
superconductors have unusual electrical properties that make 
them ideal for use in radar and other military applications using 
microwave communications mead said 
for radar and microwave applications i think the united 
states is way ahead he said

alexander dubcek the czechoslovak leader whose 
experiment in socialism with a human face was crushed by warsaw 
pact forces in 1968 said he had no regrets about his decision not 
to resist the invasion 
dubcek also said he believed his colleagues gave him sedatives 
during a showdown with soviet leader leonid brezhnev in an attempt 
to curb his temper 
i know that newsreel film shot at the time showed the people 
angry and ready for any sacrifice perhaps our army also would have 
been willing to stand up and fight but i think that the decision 
we made at the time was correct dubcek told independent 
television in an interview to be aired monday night 
if we had resisted which is certainly what the soviets 
expected we would have drowned in blood he said 
granada television said it was dubceks first extended interview 
with western journalists in 20 years 
the interview was conducted earlier this month by the producers 
of invasion granadas 1980 dramatization of the warsaw pact 
action in august 1968 and the confrontation in moscow the following 
october between dubcek and brezhnev 
the producers gave dubcek a videotape of the program and the 
interview shows him reacting to various scenes comments by dubcek 
now chairman of the czechoslovak national assembly were translated 
into english and dubbed into the program 
arrested after the invasion and taken to moscow dubcek then 
first secretary of the czechoslovak communist party said he told 
prime minister oldrich cernik he would take no part in negotiations 
intended to produce a written agreement with the soviets on his 
countrys future 
i told cernik to tell the presidium that i had resigned 
dubcek said his colleagues refused to accept his resignation 
dubcek said the czechoslovaks did win three concessions from the 
soviets they did not accept justification for the invasion there 
was no agreement to cancel czechoslovak reforms and there was no 
acceptance of the right of any other communist country to negotiate 
czechoslovakias future 
although our delegation was successful in keeping these three 
points out of the draft document we had to compromise to avoid 
bloodshed at home and to make sure that all the members of our 
delegation returned to prague safely he said 
when my colleagues read out the draft to me before the signing 
ceremony i told them look you know me you know my temperament 
i cannot guarantee that once i sit down and face them across a 
table ill just sign it i could ruin everything i may not be able 
to control myself thats the danger dubcek continued 
they kept saying calm down calm down i know now they had 
been giving me sedatives not injections but tablets vitamins 
and other sedatives that would make me amenable and keep me happy 
the invasion film claimed dubcek was given injections 
i dont know how many tablets i had dubcek said i know i 
look a pretty quiet man smiling peaceful looking more peaceful 
than i feel 
anyway the tablets simply didnt work 
the film showed dubcek losing his temper telling brezhnev that 
negotiations were a waste of time and that soviet leaders were 
blind to their own faults 
they goosestepped out just like that in the film and left 
us dubcek said 
by standing up against them and adopting a position which i 
knew they couldnt possibly accept i set out to create an 
atmosphere which would force them to break off which is what 
happened as the film shows they left the hall the document was 
unsigned and a total split opened up he said 
eventually on oct 16 dubcek and all but one of his colleagues 
signed a treaty accepting the temporary stationing of soviet troops 
in czechoslovakia

two cosmonauts ended a 22week mission monday that 
included the first american experiment aboard the space station 
mir floating out of the clear blue sky onto the glistening snow of 
the kazakhstan steppe 
staterun television broadcast a recording of the descent module 
of a soyuz tm8 capsule its white parachute casting a shadow in 
the vast snowy expanse 
mission commander alexander s viktorenko and flight engineer 
alexander a serebrov touched down near arkalyk in kazakhstan 
republic 1080 miles southeast of moscow the tass news agency 
said 
viktorenko 42 and his 45yearold crewmate were reported in 
good health tass said 
the tv report showed the cosmonauts smiling as they sat covered 
with blankets in the minus 26degree fahrenheit temperatures at the 
remote landing site they sipped hot drinks as well as champagne on 
a plane flight later monday to star city the cosmonaut training 
center near moscow 
viktorenko and serebrov blasted off sept 5 on a mission to mir 
that featured dozens of scientific experiments and the successful 
testing of a space motorcycle a oneman vehicle designed for 
repairing satellites servicing the buran space shuttle and 
rescuing cosmonauts in distress they tested the motorcycle during 
two of five spacewalks 
a replacement crew anatoly solovyov and alexander balandin 
flew to the space platform feb 11 and will remain aboard for about 
six months to continue the experiments 
among the 200 pounds of scientific cargo viktorenko and serebrov 
brought back were protein crystals exposed to weightlessness in an 
american experiment created by payload systems inc the company was 
the first authorized by the us commerce department to fly 
experiments aboard the soviet space station 
the crystals brought to space dec 20 will be shipped to the 
united states and analyzed at the brookhaven national laboratory 
next month according to payload officials 
other research completed by the returning cosmonauts included 
experiments in geophysics astrophysics medical biology and 
biotechnology tass said 
viktorenko and serebrov were the fifth crew to live for an 
extended period aboard mir the primary building block of the 
soviet orbital station launched in february 1986 
during their 166day stay in weightlessness the crew 
underwent regular medical checkups providing new data about mans 
working abilities and functional state during different stages of 
the flight tass said 
the 20ton platform designed to be permanently manned remained 
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and to give soviet 
scientists a chance to prepare two addon modules for mir 
one of the modules the kvant2 astrophysics laboratory was 
activated and successfully tested by the two cosmonauts tass said

kathleen brown daughter of californias 
builder governor and sister of its solar governor is trying to 
project her own image as she runs for state treasurer 
for 29 of the last 39 years a brown has held one of the states 
top political offices 
edmund g pat brown sr was attorney general from 1951 
through 1958 and governor from 1959 through 1966 edmund g 
jerry brown jr was secretary of state from 1971 through 1974 
governor from 1975 through 1982 and currently is chairman of the 
california democratic party 
now its kathleen 44 a lawyer who has been described as 
combining her fathers political charm with her brothers brains 
being related to two of the most wellknown politicians in the 
state brings ms brown the instant recognition a politician needs 
along with instant identification not always desirable with the 
very different accomplishments and problems of her father and her 
brother 
her father a classic gregarious politician built freeways 
universities and water projects and lost his third term bid to 
ronald reagan in 1966 her brother a cerebral jesuittrained 
visionary stressed alternate energy conservation and mass transit 
until he lost his 1982 us senate race to republican pete wilson 
her task now is to take that recognition as far as politically 
beneficial and move beyond it to create her own political persona 
she has several ready lines she uses when confronted with 
questions about her father and brother 
i have three marvelous assets i am a woman i am a democrat 
and i am a brown the liability side of my balance sheet includes 
the fact that i am a woman running for treasurer i am a democrat 
and i am a brown 
im not my father and im not my brother im a brown but im 
a different shade of brown my own shade of brown 
the state treasurer was once an obscure functionary until the 
late jesse unruh realized its potential and began organizing other 
states to use their power in the financial markets the treasurer 
not only invests the 19 billion in tax funds that isnt being used 
at any given moment but also sells the billions in bonds that 
build everything from prisons to sewage plants 
ms brown is unopposed for the democratic nomination in the june 
primary but in november will have to face one of two republicans 
who each have their own formidable connections like ms brown 
neither has run for statewide office before 
the incumbent is thomas hayes a former legislative auditor who 
registered as a republican only when gov george deukmejian 
appointed him to the vacancy created by unruhs death hayes has 
untested political skills but has all of the campaign apparatus of 
deukmejian who is retiring from politics after this term 
the other gop candidate is angela bay buchanan former us 
treasurer and sister of conservative columnist patrick buchanan 
in 1987 after ms brown moved back to california from new york 
with her family los angeles mayor tom bradley appointed her to the 
fivemember los angeles board of public works she resigned last 
summer to campaign fulltime 
hayes criticizes ms brown as a politician without his 
experience in managing and overseeing state finances ms buchanan 
criticizes both ms brown and hayes for holding new york 
fundraisers to collect contributions from investment bankers and 
says she will not accept money from firms that do business with the 
treasurers office 
ms brown calls hayes a technocrat and ms buchanan an ideologue 
she wont say which republican shed prefer facing in november 
instead she recalls her father and advisers discussing his run for 
a third term in 1966 when he was afraid he would have to run 
against a popular san francisco republican the advisers preferred 
a retired actor from southern california an easy target 
i learned my lesson she said

a former justice minister who was 
forced to resign after being the only woman to reach a cabinet post 
pleaded innocent monday to charges she illegally tipped her husband 
about a drug money probe 
elisabeth kopp testified before the supreme court on the opening 
day of the first criminal proceedings against a government minister 
in swiss history 
kopp her former personal assistant and another ministry aide 
are charged with breaking official secrets laws if convicted they 
face jail terms of up to three years 
kopp resigned jan 12 1989 under political pressure a special

a clandestine countdown advanced 
smoothly monday toward a fiery predawn liftoff thursday of space 
shuttle atlantis with five military astronauts and a spy satellite 
you wouldnt believe how smooth it is said nasa spokeswoman 
lisa malone the count picked up right on time without a hitch 
sunday night and weve had no problems 
shuttle forecasters said the weather outlook was 60 percent 
favorable for a launch thursday they said the main concern was an 
advancing cold front that could bring low clouds and rain into the 
area 
malone could not reveal the exact status of the countdown 
because of the classified nature of the mission the sixth 
dedicated to the defense department in 34 shuttle flights 
the count will be made public just nine minutes before the 
planned liftoff on thursday officials have said only that the 
launch will take place between midnight and 4 am but sources 
close to the program report atlantis is to take off at 1 am 
once atlantis is in orbit there will be a news blackout on what 
is happening until an hour before the shuttle returns to earth the 
flight is expected to last four days 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
shuttles payload is a 37300pound 500 million satellite 
designed to take highresolution reconnaissance photos and 
eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in much of the 
world 
they said the satellite will be launched into a highinclination 
orbit that will cover most of the soviet union including northern 
areas not previously flown over by shuttlelaunched spy satellites 
the soviets have heavy concentrations of naval ships and submarines 
and several missile bases in the far north 
the satellite known by the code name afp731 and other 
reconnaissance spacecraft will be important in verifying whether 
the soviets are complying with ussoviet disarmament agreements 
now being forged 
the soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor us 
compliance 
the five astronauts who will fly the atlantis mission reviewed 
their flight plan monday and went to bed about noon they have been 
adjusting their hours to match the sleep time they will have in 
space from about noon to 8 pm

michel aoun has told the christian 
militia challenging his supremacy to give up its east beirut 
strongholds in 72 hours or face an allout assault sources close 
to the rebel general said monday 
they said aoun informed samir geagea when a ceasefire began 
saturday that geageas lebanese forces militia had until late 
tuesday to withdraw from beirut port and the nearby karantina 
quarter 
lebanese forces officials declined comment but said geagea was 
prepared to negotiate differences with aoun 
late monday a threeman christian mediation committee that 
arranged the truce saturday said aoun and geagea had accepted a 
sixpoint agreement to strengthen the ceasefire 
there was little sign of decreased tension both sides 
reinforced their positions and christian civilians continued 
fleeing areas where fighting appeared possible 
the sources close to aoun speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the general would not leave geageas forces intact to mount 
another challenge 
a statement from the mediation committee said however that the 
combatants agreed to forming a national authority led by aoun 
within christian territory while leaving the lebanese forces 
intact that would leave the question of military supremacy 
unsettled 
aoun commands about 19000 men and attacked geagea on jan 30 in 
an attempt to establish sole authority over the 310sqaremile 
enclave north and east of beirut where 1 million christians live 
he now controls most of east beirut the mountains on the enclaves 
eastern flank and part of the coast 
geageas militia which has about 6000 regulars and several 
thousand reservists holds the coastal areas of kesrouan and 
batroun north of beirut and pockets in the capital 
his headquarters is in karantina next to the ashrafiyeh 
district a militia stronghold that has held out against aouns 
forces 
one source said the general is determined to capture 
ashrafiyeh and karantina to get to the port hell settle for 
nothing less than having beirut port to resupply his forces 
lebanese forces militiamen captured beirut port early in the 
battle leaving aoun with no harbor through which to receive 
supplies by sea geagea holds jounieh and byblos the only major 
ports in christian territory 
hes giving the lebanese forces time to pull out of ashrafiyeh 
and karantina peacefully one of the sources said otherwise 
hell uproot them by force the assault will be very bloody if 
geagea approves the truce will hold if he doesnt the clashes 
will resume 
annahar a respected beirut newspaper reported monday that 
geagea had flown to paris to meet with christian members of the 
lebanese parliament the report could not be confirmed 
independently 
police said the ceasefire the 12th of the 3weekold battle 
had allowed christians in the enclave to start repairing homes and 
businesses 
many remained wary however 
theyve seen many ceasefires collapse said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations many 
areas are still mined and fortifications have not been removed 
an army sergeant his wife and five children were killed when 
their car hit a mine in the tahwita district police said monday 
night that raised the toll to at least 667 people killed and 1872 
wounded in the worst fighting between christians since the 
moslemchristian civil war began in april 1975 
police estimated property damage at 750 million 
statements from both sides monday urged employees of water 
electricity and telephone companies to start repairing damage to 
the systems the police spokesman said debris and burned cars were 
being removed from streets 
aoun and geagea are maronite catholics the main christian sect 
in lebanon that has dominated the government army and judiciary 
since independence from france in 1943 
president elias hrawi a maronite elected president by 
parliament in november dismissed aoun as military commander but 
the general refused to step aside and does not recognize hrawi as 
president hrawi has syrian support and a mandate to implement a 
peace agreement aoun rejects 
fighting between aoun and geagea began when geagea refused the 
generals demand that he disband the lebanese forces the largest 
christian militia in lebanon 
geagea recognizes hrawi but has not taken a public position on 
the peace plan aoun rejects the plan because it does not set a 
timetable for withdrawal from lebanon of syrias 40000 soldiers 
with whom aoun fought a sixmonth artillery war that ended in 
september 
the syrians have been in lebanon since 1976 a year after the 
civil war began under a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
aoun calls them an occupation force 
a christian radio station voice of lebanon quoted a source 
close to geagea on monday as saying the militia chieftain was ready 
to begin talks based on mutual respect and safeguarding 
political freedoms 
the lebanese cause needs the two guns together and eliminating 
one will weaken the other the source quoted geagea as saying 
a source close to aoun responded there can only be a solution 
by unifying the gun and not by talking about two guns

a solidaritybacked candidate defeated an 
ethnic german in a parliament byelection that provoked ethnic 
sentiments in southwestern poland officials announced monday 
dorota simonides a professor specializing in the folklore of 
the silesia region received 258138 votes or 67 percent to 
defeat henryk krol a leader of the ethnic german community in the 
province of opole said a dispatch by the state pap news agency 
krol received 124498 votes or 32 percent pap reported 
turnout in sundays voting was 55 percent compared with 314 
percent attendance during the first round on feb 4 
in the two weeks since krol finished first and mrs simonides 
second in a fourcandidate field forcing sundays runoff emotions 
have run high in the industrialized silesia region historically 
contested by poland and germany 
ethnic germans comprise about onethird of the provinces 1 
million residents 
mrs simonides rejected any campaign appeals based on the ethnic 
difference between her and krol but it appeared that she inherited 
the support of the two eliminated candidates who had made such 
appeals 
i will be a senator of all residents of the opole province 
and thus also of the german minority she told polish television 
after her victory 
i would like to help to integrate spread agreement and real 
reconciliation she said 
the campaign was also waged against the backdrop of the planned 
reunification of germany a prospect that raises bitter memories of 
past german aggressions 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki seeking an ironclad 
guarantee of polands current border with germany has asked to 
participate at planned unification negotiations 
opole province is part of the nearly onethird of modern poland 
composed of lands forfeited by germany after world war ii 
compensating for an even larger polish territory taken by the 
soviets on the eastern border 
polish concern was evident during the campaign the 
prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza reported that one campaign leaflet 
called for being alert at the moment that the historic german 
enemy is raising his head 
across opole graffiti proclaimed krol to germany germans to 
germany and krol fascist the newspaper said 
opole province 190 miles southwest of warsaw has the highest 
concentration of enthic germans in the country and krol and his 
father jan krol were founders of the areas german minority 
culturalsocial society 
there are believed to be up to 1 million ethnic germans among 
polands population of 38 million 
communist officials for decades denied that any german minority 
remained in poland that changed with recent efforts by the 
solidarityled mazowiecki government to assure rights to ethnic 
minorities along with a visit to the region in november by west 
german chancellor helmut kohl 
there are no ethnic germans among the 460 members of the sejm 
the lower house of parliament or the 100 freely elected members of 
the senate 
sundays election was to fill the senate seat left vacant by the 
recent death of the incumbent

barbara bush dog millie in tow 
went looking for holiday bargains monday taking a brisk 1mile 
stroll to a favorite clothes shop 
mrs bush strode purposefully in icy morning air along the 
oceanfront road from the family compound to carlas corner near the 
village center where several dozen people gathered outside 
including a camera crew and a few reporters who had chanced upon 
her 
havent you ever seen an old lady walk a dog before she 
quipped to a photographer who took a photo of her greeting a woman 
and child standing on a snowy sidewalk 
the first lady who is known to resent press scrutiny of what 
she considers her private life also firmly told a reporter 
goodbye as she entered carlas you go on down into town 
she added 
she was accompanied by an aide and a small security detail as 
she took advantage of the chance to exercise a public spontaneity 
that is almost impossible within the confines of the white house 
later mrs bush chatted with reporters aboard air force one on 
the trip back to washington 
on the presidents suggestion the day before that he might 
invite soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to their maine home mrs 
bush said that bush had not told her about it 
but she added you know me anybody he asks ill be nice 
to 
on another subject she said that the 50000 rug that former 
president reagan had put in the oval office and which bush had 
taken out so one he liked could be put in its place would likely 
be given on loan to the reagan library when it is opened 
on her morning walk mrs bush walked past carlas corner 
window which advertised sales with savings of 50 percent to 60 
percent but the spring outfit mrs bush chose a black and white 
twopiece dress was not on sale said storekeeper lee walker mrs 
bush dressed in jeans and tennis shoes did not want to try it on 
so she took it to try at home before buying it she said 
store owner carla perkins said mrs bush and her family were 
regular customers 
when mrs bush came out she seemed exasperated by the cameras 
and good naturedly motioned them away 
she declined to answer questions about her purchases but did 
comment on dog millies health when asked 
george is convinced shes sick but it really is because shes 
jealous of her son a big bounding dog who belongs to one of 
bushs sons and frequently visits the white house mrs bush said 
its more in the mind than the body she said of millies 
listlessness 
after letting some local children pet millie mrs bush took off 
at a jog with her aides 
however she decided after a short distance to get in the car 
and ride back to walkers point commenting that her entourage and 
the accompanying car and photographers were likely to cause a 
traffic accident on the twolane road 
she also stopped on the way into town at the stately old 
nonantum hotel to see her aides room in the newly added wing 
mrs bush who spends every summer in kennebunkport with her 
husband said she had never seen the new part

ingvar carlsson who has led a 
caretaker administration since resigning as prime minister last 
week was asked monday to form a new government 
the speaker of parliament thage g peterson turned to carlsson 
after opposition leader carl bildt of the moderate party declared 
himself unable to assemble a centerright coalition 
after meeting with the speaker carlsson said he had been given 
until wednesday evening to determine whether he could form a new 
cabinet 
his minority social democratic government resigned thursday 
after parliament defeated his proposals for a twoyear wage and 
price freeze intended to combat inflation 
carlsson said his hopes of forming a new government hinged on 
building support for a new economic program but he did not say how 
his proposals would be modified 
bildt said peterson gave him the chance saturday to form a 
nonsocialist coalition but he could not put together a 
parliamentary majority or working minority 
the social democrats who hold 156 of riksdags 349 seats 
governed with the support of the communists who have 21 seats the 
communists joined the centerright opposition against carlssons 
economic package arguing that it would hurt people with low 
incomes 
under the constitution peterson may assign the task of forming 
a government four times then elections must be held the social 
democrats have been out of power only six years since 1932 
finance minister kjellolof feldt resigned from the caretaker 
government monday he was the architect of the economic recovery 
that began in 1982 and in recent years won respect from 
businessmen for reducing the regulation of banking and financial 
markets 
feldt said parliament had blocked him from imposing the tight 
fiscal policies he felt necessary to stop a wagecost spiral that 
threatened exports and that his own party sometimes did not 
support him

question how many board of education 
bureaucrats does it take to change a light bulb 
answer fill this out in triplicate and check back in a month 
thats the level of absurdity facing new schools chancellor 
joseph fernandez as he delves into bureaucracy and red tape at the 
new york education headquarters 
according to the daily news hundreds of teachers received a 
memo last year titled proper handwashing 
in seven easy steps the teachers were reminded that running 
water is necessary to carry away dirt and debris advised to use 
a circular motion and friction for 15 to 30 seconds and told 
to discard paper towels in receptacle 
fernandez faced with a system of 950000 students 1000 
buildings and a backlog of 33000 repair requests asked 
departments what their urgent needs were 
the director of the office of professional development and 
leadership training said her top priority was a concretizing 
mission 
a what 
capacity building of personnel resources the director 
wrote and personal abilities of central board of education 
districts and school sic to facilitate generating vehicles to 
assist schools in nurturing student achievement 
oh 
the official who was not identified in the news story showed 
off her abilities as an empire builder when she proposed the 
creation of a coalition of professional developers to provide help 
to the schools 
the coalition she said would be assisted by district support 
teams eventually the school board could create an academy of 
learning teaching supervising and management that would consist 
of four institutes including an institute for intellectual and 
creative development 
the bottom line a modest 2 million would pay for the entire 
lot the cpd the dsts the altsm and the iicd as they might 
eventually be known 
another priceless piece of paperwork came from public school 140 
in the bronx whose principal decided to ease congestion in the 
school office 
her solution request form for permission to come behind the 
counter in the main office that form was discontinued last year 
after being ridiculed by the teachers union

second attack 
police said that in the first assault four israeli 
fighterbombers fired eight rockets at the installations the 
guerrillas immediately closed all roads leading to the bases 
thirty minutes later a police spokesman said another formation 
of israeli fighterbombers hit the bases as the guerrillas tried to 
evacuate their casualties 
the raids brought to six the number of israeli air strikes 
against guerrilla targets in lebanon this year the last was feb 
16 against a shiite moslem amal militia base in alhajjah in 
southern lebanon 
the moscoworiented democratic front and terrorist abu nidals 
fatahrevolutionary council regularly attack targets in israels 
selfdesignated security zone in southern lebanon 
israel usually launches air strikes into lebanon in retaliation 
for guerrilla raids 
the army said the democratic front was responsible for a series 
of attacks on israeli troops including an incident wednesday in 
which four guerrillas tried to infiltrate into israels buffer zone 
in southern lebanon one guerrilla was killed and three captured in 
that incident 
the security zone six to 10 miles deep was established when 
israel withdrew the bulk of its army from lebanon in 1985 three 
years after it invaded the zone runs east from the mediterranean 
coast to the slopes of mount hermon and was designed as a buffer 
against guerrilla raids

a huge east german crane began dismantling a 
long section of the berlin wall next to the brandenburg gate on 
monday night and thousands of people cheered 
more than a mile of the wall is to be taken down between the 
reichstag building and the checkpoint charlie crossing point most 
of it is to be replaced by a fence 
this is terrific said ralf lukas an east german soldier 
who operated the crane it had to happen i was terribly lucky to 
be on the job 
a crowd of onlookers estimated by one policeman at 7000 
cheered as the crane began removing pieces from the top of the wall 
and loading them into a truck to be hauled away 
im so happy to see the wall come down said rita wolter 
20 of east berlin it was a blight on our country 
others stood on sections of the wall away from the crane 
watching the work under bright floodlights 
joachim damme of west berlin brought his little girl this is 
a historic event i want to be part of it i also want to show this 
to my daughter 
east german officials said they will leave a 200yard gap in the 
wall between the brandenburg gate and the reichstag but nearby 
fences on the eastern side would prevent unobstructed access to the 
opening 
rainer menzel a spokesman for east german border troops said 
the entire wall between the gate and checkpoint charlie would be 
down by the end of march 
since nov 9 the east germans have been opening numerous 
passages through the berlin wall although the east germans require 
a check of passports or identity cards at all of them 
the reichstag is the expected seat of the parliament of a united 
germany although officials say it will take years to renovate the 
ornate building

ingvar carlsson who has led a 
caretaker administration since resigning as prime minister last 
week was asked monday to form a new government 
the speaker of parliament thage g peterson turned to carlsson 
after opposition leader carl bildt of the moderate party declared 
himself unable to assemble a centerright coalition 
after meeting with the speaker carlsson said he had been given 
until wednesday evening to determine whether he could form a new 
cabinet

after parliament defeated his proposals for a twoyear wage and 
price freeze intended to combat inflation

building support for a new economic program but he did not say how 
his proposals would be modified 
bildt said peterson gave him the chance saturday to form a 
nonsocialist coalition but he could not put together a 
parliamentary majority or working minority 
the social democrats who hold 156 of riksdags 349 seats 
governed with the support of the communists who have 21 seats the 
communists joined the centerright opposition against carlssons 
economic package arguing that it would hurt people with low 
incomes 
under the constitution peterson may assign the task of forming 
a government four times then elections must be held the social 
democrats have been out of power only six years since 1932 
finance minister kjellolof feldt resigned from the caretaker 
government monday he was the architect of the economic recovery 
that began in 1982 and in recent years won respect from 
businessmen for reducing the regulation of banking and financial 
markets 
feldt said parliament had blocked him from imposing the tight 
fiscal policies he felt necessary to stop a wagecost spiral that 
threatened exports and that his own party sometimes did not 
support him

west germanys ambassador to the 
united states told american jewish leaders monday they have little 
to fear from german reunification but he met sharp questioning 
in his first public address to a jewish audience since serious 
discussions began of a union of east and west germany ambassador 
jurgen ruhfus said germans have for four decades worked to make 
sure nazi atrocities can never be repeated 
he said a united german state would be accountable not to 
nationalism but to a new european federation based on individual 
freedoms and human rights 
we germans are aware that a germany growing together will be 
viewed in part with concern with considerable concern he told 
about 500 delegates at the american jewish congress national 
covention we are convinced that this fear is unjustified 
ruhfus repeated west german chancellor helmut kohls rejection 
of the soviet position that the united germany be neutral he said 
north atlantic treaty organization membership would help keep 
german nationalism from again becoming the force that spurred world 
wars i and ii 
his audience was in a dubious mood and there were repeated 
questions about what the new german state would do to ensure that 
centuriesold ethnic and religious conflicts would not explode 
there is no guarantee but i can from my deepest convictions 
say that you can trust us ruhfus said prompting groans from the 
crowd you can count on germans to stand up against any 
infringement of human rights 
ruhfus was asked what has changed about germans that should 
allow jews to trust them 
i understand the feelings of those who have suffered if we 
want to shape the future we must be aware of the past he said 
the first thing that has changed is that the germans themselves 
have awakened in horror at what was done in their names they are 
standing up and saying we must never let this happen again 
members of the audience were skeptical 
the concerns so deeply felt by so many jews because of the 
trauma of the holocaust are not easily susceptible to dissipation 
by some simple even rational political formula henry siegman 
executive director of the american jewish congress said afterward 
to the extent that a jewish audience can be reassured that the 
german political leaders understand their concerns and recognize 
therefore a serious responsibility to act in a manner that allays 
them the ambassadors presentation was extremely well received 
and considered reassuring siegman added 
ruhfus said west germany has accepted responsibility for the 
hitlerera deaths of some 12 million people including 6 million 
jews it demonstrates this he said by compensating victims 
financially by being a staunch ally of israel and by placing its 
goal of a unified germany within a european framework 
ruhfus hailed talks in ottawa last week in which france 
britain the soviet union and united states endorsed german unity 
he also called for a summit to create paneuropean institutions 
based in a unified berlin that would include a european human 
rights court an environmental protection agency and an agency to 
verify disarmament by nato and warsaw pact countries 
this could become the first step on the way to a european 
confederation that french president francois mitterrand has 
recently proposed my government supports this idea as a concrete 
goal for our joint efforts to create a europe undivided from the 
atlantic to the urals 
with the new german state embedded in the future architecture 
of europe the country will have no interest in the sort of 
nationalist hegemony that fueled the wars of kaiser wilhelm and 
adolf hitler ruhfus said 
monday was the conclusion of the fourday conference

secret police said they seized 10 
shoulderfired missiles from drug traffickers on monday four days 
after president bush came to colombia amid fears the traffickers 
would use such weapons against him 
the missiles can shoot down aircraft 
in another development leftist guerrillas blew up colombias 
main oil pipeline for the sixth time this year in an effort to 
force the government to nationalize us and other foreign oil 
holdings officials said the pipeline would be out of service until 
at least wednesday 
a news release from the administrative security department the 
countrys secret police said the missiles were found in a raid on 
a bogota drug hideout 
it said two men arrested there were suspects in the november 
slaying of tv news anchorman enrique pulido in the capital 
pulido was one of 13 news media workers killed since president 
virgilio barco last august ordered security forces to wipe out the 
traffickers 
the police gave few details of the raid 
a us drug enforcement administration source told the 
associated press last month that colombian security forces have 
been making spectacular raids based on information found in records 
discovered in previous raids 
police and the army have seized scores of ranches mansions and 
warehouses belonging to traffickers and 33 million in us cash 
and gold 
the us secret service warned before bush visited cartagena 
last thursday that drug traffickers had sam7s a surfacetoair 
missile that is capable of downing large aircraft 
the medellin cocaine cartel said on jan 17 it would dismantle 
its drug empire and stop its campaign of terror in colombia if the 
government agreed to a truce security forces have kept pursuing 
the traffickers however 
bush went to the caribbean port city of cartagena to meet with 
presidents barco alan garcia of peru and jaime paz zamora of 
boliviad and all reaffirmed their will to fight drug traffickers 
the white house considered danger of attacks from traffickers or 
leftist guerrillas so grave that it had bush land in barranquilla 
a halfhour away from cartagena because the airport there is more 
isolated bush flew by helicopter over the ocean to cartagena 
sundays oil pipeline attack was by the national liberation 
army the government oil company ecopetrol said in a news release 
it said guerrillas blew up several yards of the pipeline near 
the village of convencion about 250 miles north of bogota 
the pipeline carries oil from the big cano limon field in 
northeastern colombia to the caribbean coast 
the same guerrilla group tried to blow up an oil pipeline near 
yopal 125 miles north of bogota sunday night but the explosion 
did not break the line ecopetrol said

chancellor helmut kohl made peace 
between his defense and foreign ministers monday on the nato role 
in a united germany while germans exiled from areas now in poland 
demanded their homelands back 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and the defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg issued a statement at kohls request 
saying neither soldiers from the alliance nor west german troops 
should be stationed in what now is east germany 
stoltenberg suggested on friday that nato defenses be applied to 
a whole germany genscher said the defense minister was 
causing unnecessary irritation where a subtle touch was needed 
in east berlin on monday most participants in weekly talks 
between the government and opposition spoke against nato membership 
for a united germany and said it should be demilitarized 
as a precondition for reunification they said east and west 
germany should issue a joint statement guaranteeing polands 
borders and giving security assurances to other european countries 
about 50000 east germans who favor a rapid union participated 
in the weekly rally monday at leipzig a center of the 
prodemocracy movement 
hans modrow east germanys communist premier told opposition 
leaders he would not go on his knees for interim aid from west 
germany 
at meetings with kohl and other west german officials last week 
in east berlin modrow asked for 15 billion marks 9 billion in 
solidarity aid to tide his government over until the nations 
free elections on march 18 
bonn refused on grounds that east germany would not disclose its 
financial condition or accept an offer to make the west german mark 
the currency of both countries west germany did provide the 
equivalent of about 35 billion in aid for projects over which 
east germany will have little control 
negotiations on economic and currency union begin tuesday in 
east berlin although modrows government has made clear such a 
step cannot be approved before the elections 
dieter vogel government spokesman in bonn told reporters kohl 
summoned stoltenberg and genscher to the chancellery monday their 
statement repeated assurances kohl made during talks in moscow with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who favors a united germany 
must be neutral 
genscher and stoltenberg who represent different parties in the 
governing coalition said no nato units or facilities would be 
extended into what is now east germany 
they said that included west german troops under nato command 
and those not directly assigned to the alliance such as 
territorial defense units 
last month genscher suggested what now is west german territory 
remain part of nato and the area east of the elbe river now east 
germany be militarily neutral 
stoltenbergs signature on the joint statement with genscher 
effectively reversed the position the defense minister took friday 
that nato troops defend all of united germany 
the security policy of the area now comprising east germany in 
all its aspects is to be determined with the freely elected 
government of east germany as well as with the four powers 
responsible for germany since world war ii it said 
the united states soviet union france and britain still have 
rights in germany the foreign ministers of all six powers 
announced last week that negotiations on german unity would begin 
soon after the east german elections 
poland has asked to be represented because of possible german 
claims to land awarded to poland after germany was defeated in 1945 
about onethird of modern poland was in hitlers third reich 
east prussia became part of the soviet union and now is called 
kaliningrad 
two organizations of germans evicted from those areas say the 
lost territories should be considered in plans for german 
reunification 
we are not giving up our silesia the ultraconservative 
silesian society said in a statement monday an article in the 
latest edition of the association of exiles weekly newsletter also 
raised the border issue 
herbert czaja head of the west german association of exiles and 
a member of parliament from kohls christian democratic union 
declared we cannot give up our homeland and 114000 square 
kilometers 45600 square miles of germany 
about 12 million germans were driven from silesia and east 
prussia after the war and at least 2 million died 
kohl has clouded the border issue by not publicly supporting the 
current border between east germany and poland

union leaders will not be intimidated 
by antiabortion forces waging a letterwriting campaign aimed at 
keeping them neutral on the issue aflcio president lane kirkland 
said monday 
kirkland spoke to reporters after the 141million member 
federation of unions opened its annual winter meeting 
as expected the executive council skipped voting on prochoice 
resolutions and appointed a 14member committee to determine 
whether the aflcio should take a position on abortion an issue 
the organization has sidestepped for more than a decade 
kirkland said union presidents have received a flood of letters 
from religious leaders and others urging them not to take an 
abortion stand 
the antiabortion national right to life committee has said the 
aflcio should not take a position on abortion because it is not 
directly related to such labor issues as collective bargaining and 
work place conditions 
prochoice union officials disagree saying abortion effects the 
economic wellbeing of working women and that the aflcio has taken 
positions on a wide range of issues including civil rights gay 
rights and school busing 
i do not think the committee will be moved by threats or 
suggestions of reprisals kirkland said of the letterwriting 
campaign i think the committee will address the issues fairly 
and rationally and on the merits and will act accordingly 
some of the letters warned that rankandfile union members 
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union 
dues withheld if the aflcio adopted a prochoice position 
prochoice union representatives said the committee formed to 
take up the abortion matter is comprised equally of those who think 
the aflcio should take a stand and those who prefer sitting out 
the issue to avoid alienating antiabortion union members 
i would say that the committee probably breaks down almost 
5050 said joyce miller vice president of the amalgamated 
clothing and textile workers union 
miller a prochoice member of the abortion committee predicted 
the aflcio could adopt a prochoice position as long as it 
includes language acknowledging the moral and religious views of 
some union members 
kirkland would not reveal his personal position on abortion 
the committees chairman william wynn president of the united 
food and commercial workers international union is prochoice but 
has said his personal feelings would not influence the panels 
decision 
kirkland did not give the committee a deadline but prochoice 
officials want a decision by the executive councils may meeting 
that would allow labor leaders to use abortion as an issue in 
making endorsements for political candidates this year 
labor secretary elizabeth dole was to meet tuesday with union 
officials as the aflcio works toward a warmer relationship with 
the bush administration than it had with president reagan 
several prominent democrats already have met with the labor 
leaders including democratic national committee chairman ronald 
brown he said organized labors support will be crucial to the 
partys congressional redistricting efforts 
brown sought help for the partys 25 million redistricting 
plan which is already partly funded by labor 
the party is putting special attention on 16 states that stand 
to gain or lose seats because of population shifts in the 1990 
census and states where legislatures are closely divided between 
republicans and democrats 
we think its going to come down to the battle of the great 
lakes and the battle of the sunbelt said tim dixon executive 
director of the partys redistricting effort called project 
500 
brown listed the 16 states as arizona california colorado 
connecticut florida illinois indiana iowa michigan new york 
ohio oregon pennsylvania texas washington and wisconsin 
thanks to the critical support of labor the hand that draws 
new district lines in 1991 will more often be democratic ones 
brown said 
house majority leader richard gephardt also met with union 
chiefs to discuss issues such as child care the proposed social 
security payroll tax cut and shifts in defense funding

politicians have moderated their 
violent language strengthening hopes that sundays elections will 
be peaceful free and fair the head of the un observer mission 
said 
iqbal riza of pakistan said monday threats exchanged by the two 
major political groups had worried all three three major observer 
groups monitoring the vote 
the ruling sandinista national liberation front and the 
usbacked united national opposition alliance of 14 parties are 
the main rivals the other two observer missions are from the 
organization of american states and former president jimmy carters 
council of freely elected heads of government 
over the last two weeks we had been rather worried about 
possible violence on election day and the day after riza said 
speaking to reporters in spanish at the foreign correspondents 
club 
over the last few days the tone has been lowered and we 
are noticing a willingness by each party to avoid violence he 
said 
more than 17 million nicaraguans are expected to vote sunday 
for a president vice president national assembly councils for 
144 municipalities and two regional councils for the atlantic coast 
riza said the un and oas observer missions would make private 
projections as early as sunday night based on a sample of partial 
returns the missions also are to make complete vote counts 
parallel with that of the supreme electoral council 
both the projection and the vote count will be kept 
confidential for comparison with the official results and will 
not be made public until later unless theres need to riza 
said 
he would not define such a need and said the figures would be 
included in the final reports of the observer missions 
speculation was that the observers might decide to release the 
information if there was evidence of cheating but riza seemed to 
dismiss the possibility of vote manipulation 
we are convinced there can be no massive fraud not only 
because of our presence but because of the measures taken he 
said 
the un and oas missions together will have 600 observers in 
teams of two visiting up to 80 percent of the 4394 polling 
places at least 1000 more observers will represent many other 
observer missions 
officials and candidates of the opposition alliance commonly 
called uno claim the sandinistas have turned government resources 
to party use 
uno has told us they anticipated an unbalanced campaign and 
they have entered the race with this knowledge so the alleged 
unfairness cannot be used now to invalidate the elections riza 
said 
its not that the process has been perfect he said but 
irregularities have not occurred to the degree of disqualifying 
the elections 
leaders of both sides have made threats against each other in 
the past two weeks virgilio godoy the opposition candidate for 
vice president said in two campaign speeches the alliance would 
make the sandinistas pay after it won the election 
president daniel ortega said the sandinistas might close the 
opposition newspaper la prensa owned by his challenger violeta 
barrios de chamorro and confiscate the homes of mrs chamorro and 
godoy the sandinistas have closed la prensa before 
interior minister tomas borge made campaign appearances in which 
he accused the opposition of planning disturbances to disrupt the 
elections 
opposition leaders denied the accusations and gave personal 
assurances to cardinal miguel obando y bravo the roman catholic 
archbishop of managua who has the respect of both sides 
all parties met at the supreme electoral council friday riza 
said the council will issue a general accord to be signed by all 
parties pledging them to promote peaceful elections 
uno closed its campaign with a rally monday in managua that 
attracted 60000 supporters the sandinistas will close their 
campaign wednesday with a rally in the capital 
no campaigning is allowed after wednesday

the european space agency said its satellite 
giotto in hibernation since a spectacular 1986 rendezvous with 
halleys comet reawakened monday on a signal from earth and is 
being readied for another mission to a comet 
esa began sending a series of commands to giotto from the madrid 
tracking station of the us national aeronautics and space 
administrations deep space network in spain to activate the 
spacecraft 
two hours and 21 minutes later the response came a weak 
whisper from 62 million miles away but enough to tell technicians 
at the esas european space operations center in darmstadt west 
germany that giotto was back in business 
the wakeup call was sent from the madrid stations 100000watt 
transmitter and 230footdiameter antenna 
esas mission control team now will perform a series of complex 
maneuvers to bring giottos highgain antenna into a better 
position to increase the signal strength and obtain telemetry data 
this was expected to take several days after which a complete 
checkout of the spacecraft will be run 
on march 14 1986 giotto passed within 375 miles of halleys 
comet the satellite was then put into hibernation sleepily 
revolving around the sun at a rate of once every 10 months 
in september the esas space science committee decided to 
assign giotto to rendezvous with the griggskjellrup comet in july 
1992 but it could take weeks for the scientists at darmstadt to 
find out if giotto is up to the job 
if its solar panels can still provide enough electricity to 
charge giottos batteries if the color camera and other 
instruments still work the craft will be given the signal july 2 
to begin its new trip 
passing within 13600 miles from earth giotto would use 
terrestrial gravity to increase its speed to catch up with 
griggskjellrup a comet that circles earth every 509 years

police fired monday on demonstrators 
demanding an end to nepals 29yearold ban on political parties 
killing five people and wounding 12 witnesses said 
a government minister said three people were killed and five 
injured in the clash in bhaktapur near the capital katmandu 
kamal thapa minister of state for communications said police 
were trying to control extremists and had to fire when the 
crowd tried to create an unpleasant scene they police had 
earlier used water hoses and charged with clubs to disperse the 
demonstrators 
he said the situation was brought under control after two hours 
on sunday a policemen and three demonstrators were killed on 
the first day of a planned mass campaign by the outlawed nepali 
congress party and the united left front an umbrella group of 
communist party factions to demand restoration of a multiparty 
system in nepal 
the congress party had pledged a peaceful campaign but thapa 
said the party had lost leadership of the movement and that it was 
in the hands of people who not support nonviolent tactics 
the situation is not grave but certainly alarming we are 
determined to suppress these extremist elements he said 
thapa said the oppositions demands ran counter to the verdict 
of a 1980 national referendum in which people voted in favor of 
continuing the nonparty system 
the nonparty system was introduced 29 years ago after king 
birendra took over the administration and dissolved the elected 
congress partyled government which he accused of misusing power 
katmandu was largely deserted monday as shops closed in 
accordance with the oppositions call for support taxis and 
private buses stayed off the roads in support of the campaign but 
some staterun buses and other vehicles were seen 
student agitators burned a bus in nearby kirtipur township and

the days when an argentine family 
could feast on filet mignon for less than what hamburger cost in 
most other countries may be nearing an end agriculture secretary 
felipe sola indicated on monday 
like most everything else in an economy wracked by 
hyperinflation and recession beef now is priced in us dollars 
rather than argentinas debased currency the austral for many 
argentines beef already is out of reach 
we argentines will have to get used to meat as something 
that is almost a luxury sola told reporters after conferring 
with president carlos menem at government house 
we will eat less or choose less expensive cuts of course 
thats not a happy or attractive situation for argentines but its 
reality 
for more than a century beef has been to argentina what oil is 
to saudi arabia a major export a source of prosperity a national 
symbol 
herds were so plentiful that travelers on the pampas the 
fertile plains surrounding buenos aires could shoot a cow for 
dinner and sometimes eat just the tongue according to legend 
provided they left the hide which would be sold for leather 
cows still outnumber argentinas 31 million citizens by almost 
21 and a top steak in a good restaurant can be had for 10000 
australs 250 or about what 22 pounds of filet mignon costs 
in a butcher shop 
thats still cheap in international terms but for many 
argentine salaries that have shrunk to 50 to 250 a month it is 
increasingly expensive 
consumption has fallen as inflation soared to 8164 percent in 
the past 12 months 
argentina still will consume more beef and veal this year than 
any other nation just under 140 pounds per person according to 
projections by the us agriculture departments foreign 
agricultural service 
but already lifestyle changes are apparent 
this nation that loves to dine out does so less and less 
guests at weekend barbecues often bring their own meat to throw on 
the grill noodles and rice have replaced beef on the shopping 
lists of argentines suffering wage shrinkage or unemployment which 
stands at about 10 percent 
so far the government has refused to intervene in the meat 
market where prices rose 45 percent between friday and monday 
that is slightly more than the austral which traded monday at 
4200 per dollar devalued last week 
the rate a year ago was 171 
the cost of living this month is projected on a par with what it 
was in january 79 percent workers might expect pay raises in that 
neighborhood but meat almost certainly will have climbed faster 
propelled by ranchers who would rather sell abroad than at home 
the price of meat is dollarized sola said

ground was broken monday for a prayer 
center that officials hope will end a long dispute over a roman 
catholic convent at the auschwitz death camp 
also monday edgar bronfman president of the world jewish 
congress met with president wojciech jaruzelski and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki and declared later there are no outstanding 
problems between the jewish people and poland 
in israel the religious affairs minister said the construction 
of the new prayer center removed a very hurtful obstacle in 
relations between israel and poland 
in my view the poles are seriously expressing a willingness to 
open a new page of good relations with the jews said the 
minister zevulun hammer 
the convent housing about a dozen carmelite nuns on the edge of 
the nazi death camp has angered jews and others worldwide who see 
it as an intrusion of christian symbols at a site where most of the 
victims were jews 
the roman catholic church agreed at negotiations in 1987 in 
switzerland to relocate the nuns to an interfaith prayer and 
education center farther from the camp but a february 1989 
deadline for moving the nuns was missed 
after polish church officials balked last year at fulfilling the 
agreement the vatican intervened in september and upheld the 
decision the new solidarityled government of mazowiecki also has 
worked to speed up construction of the new center 
cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow whose archdiocese has 
jurisdiction over the site near the southern polish city of 
oswiecim presided over the groundbreaking ceremony 
may justice peace and love radiate from this place and let 
people find enough strength in this place to overcome what divides 
them for the good of mankind macharski said as he took a 
shovel and dug out a few scoopfuls of dirt 
during his meeting in warsaw with bronfman macharski said his 
governments support of the project was illustrated by the presence 
at the ceremony of jacek ambroziak head of the office of the 
council of ministers and the prime ministers close aide 
this is not only a matter for poland or europe ambroziak 
said before the ceremony the construction of this center will 
have international significance in view of the extermination of the 
jewish nation which here suffered the greatest losses 
the first phase of construction will be to erect a temporary 
fence around the site now an empty field with a few trees in the 
distance and a sign announcing the planned construction 
bronfman called the groundbreaking very important 
citing the prayer center construction polands plans to launch 
full diplomatic relations with israel next week and the 
governments pledge to fight antisemitism bronfman said that 
there were no longer problems between the jews and poland but he 
also said he did not know exactly when the interfaith center would 
be completed and the nuns moved 
i dont think deadlines are useful he said it creates a 
kind of emotionalism that i think is not good so i did not press 
for an absolute deadline the spirit was as soon as possible 
he also expressed concern at what he called a resurgence of 
antisemitism in poland 
this is part i suppose of the price of democracy bronfman 
said if you are free to do anything else you are free also to 
not like people 
but he said the governments stance against antisemitism is 
very clear 
i express the intention of the polish government in all 
matters relating to polishjewish relations to arrange them 
successfully and to remove all frictions said mazowiecki in a 
brief statement after the meeting 
we are thoroughly opposed to any form of antisemitism and we 
believe that it should be counteracted by every means 
the new religious center at auschwitz will be about a 
quartermile from the death camp on a nineacre site 
known officially as the center for information dialogue 
educaton and prayer at auschwitz it will include meeting rooms 
exhibition and conference halls a library and accommodations for 
nearly 100 people pap said 
a separate section of the building will house the convent 
according to the rev marek glownia appointed to head the 
foundation by the krakow archdiocese 
the vatican has pledged financial support for the construction 
and funds also will be raised by the foundations and churches 
elsewhere in europe

the central bank and five other 
national banks were hit by strikes monday over plans to close 
surplus branches and lay off staff 
were not against restructuring state and private banks but 
we want to be at the negotiating table said hector pizzichini a 
leader of the 149000member bank workers association after 
thousands of members marched noisily through buenos aires 
financial district 
in other unrest over government economic policies university 
professors began an indefinite strike demanding that their salaries 
be nearly doubled to 90 a month their action may stall the start 
of the college year set for next month 
also clerks who shut down federal courts last thursday to back 
up their wage demands plan to do so again this thursday and friday 
the government last week proposed closing 14 branches of the 
national mortgage bank which was reported to run at a huge deficit 
and said to be overstaffed about 1200 jobs would be lost 
although the government pledged to transfer those who did not 
retire 
government officials said then that similar measures would be 
taken at the national savings bank and the national investment bank 
the national investment bank went so far astray in granting and 
collecting on loans that its 60 biggest debtors alone owe it 19 
billion the newspaper pagina 12 reported sunday citing data it 
said was obtained from the bank 
striking employees virtually closed down all three banks on 
monday 
besides the central bank the bank of the nation and the buenos 
aires province bank the two biggest in the country also were 
disrupted 
labor minister jorge triaca accused striking bank employees of 
meddling in plans that the government has established and said 
the strike may be declared illegal if employees dont return to 
work immediately 
that would allow the government to fire workers and take other 
discipinary actions 
tensions between the government of president carlos menem and 
organized labor have been growing since he adopted policies seen as 
antiunion although labor backed menem in the national elections 
last may 
to curtail inflation of 197 percent last july the month he took 
office menem allowed prices to rise faster than wages and 
increased public service rates by as much as 600 percent 
critics say menem has put a higher priority on narrowing the 
fiscal deficit and reducing inflation than on safeguarding workers 
buying power 
saul ubaldini one of the two secretariesgeneral of the 3 
millionmember general labor confederation last week urged menem 
to change the political economy and pressed for big increases 
in the national minimum wage 
member unions have resisted menem plans to privatize 
deficitridden state companies 
the confrontation coincides with a new burst of inflation the 
cost of living soared by 79 percent in january and is projected at 
about the same rate this month 
the austral argentinas national currency lost another 11 
percent against the dollar trading at 45001 on monday compared 
to 40001 on friday the austral lost 36 percent of its value in a 
week and 73 percent since early january

gen justin lekhanya said on government radio that some 
changes would be announced shortly he did not elaborate 
information minister vincent malebo held a brief news conference 
monday afternoon but refused to confirm or deny that members of the 
military council had been arrested 
troops surrounded government headquarters and forced three army 
colonels on the military council with their hands raised above 
their heads to get into the back of a military truck the 
witnesses said 
the transportation minister col monyane mokhanpso also was

lekhanya and his military council rule lesotho in consultation 
with king moshoeshoe ii the council which has good relations with 
the south african government seized power in a bloodless 1986 coup

council who were detained are sekhobe letsie thaabe letsie and 
aloysius mosoeunyane all of whom are colonels the letsies who 
are brothers also are cousins of king moshoeshoe ii 
the military council has banned all political parties and 
refused demands to call elections in lesotho which is completely 
surrounded by south africa

december 1988 at an inquest last year lekhanya said he shot the 
student george ramone after the man attempted to rape a woman and 
then fled the inquest ruled the shooting a justifiable homicide

as otto von bismarck once said politics is 
the art of the possible as possible as wrongly attributing the 
quote to a legendary irish barkeeper 
for pundits and politicians wanting to punch up their 
pronouncements with such pithy remarks help is at hand for 29 
the library of congress will provide 2100 similarly sage sayings 
and with the right attribution 
over the years the librarys congressional research service has 
found itself continually bombarded by requests for appropriate 
quotes for use in papers and speeches 
its researchers have discovered that many a quote popularly 
attributed to a famous person was actually uttered or scribbled by 
someone else for example the german chancellors comment on 
politics often attributed to finley peter dunnes mr dooley 
the 520page volume entitled respectfully quoted a dictionary 
of quotations requested from the congressional research service 
and for sale by the government printing office has several similar 
examples 
lincolns you can fool all of the people some of the time and 
some of the people all of the time has never been verified 
the volume points out nor has let them eat cake alleged to 
have been said by marie antoinette when informed the french people 
had no bread 
winning isnt everything its the only thing generally 
attributed to former green bay packer coach vince lombardi was 
actually said by red sanders at vanderbilt in 1948 the volume 
reports in fact it adds lombardi always denied having said it 
other corrections in attribution include it is better that one 
hundred guilty persons escape than one innocent person should 
suffer often attributed to supreme court justices oliver wendell 
holmes or louis brandeis actually was first stated by benjamin 
franklin 
currently the most requested quotation the research service 
says is from a 1977 speech of former vice president hubert h 
humphrey 
it was once said that the moral test of government is how that 
government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children 
those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who 
are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the 
handicapped 
a member of congress contemplating action or inaction might 
consider british author gk chesteron or french statesman georges 
clemenceau 
i do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act 
but i do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act 
chesterton wrote 
in order to act you must be somewhat insane a reasonably 
sensible man is satisfied with thinking clemenceau once said 
the collection is replete with patriotic quotations always 
popular with politicians including large sections under such 
headings as america democracy citizenship patriotism and union 
but quotations are also included under such headings as vietnam 
and watergate tyranny and violence hate and ignorance 
even a few last words are included such as sir james m 
barries to die will be an awfully big adventure and dont 
give up the ship attributed to admiral oliver hazard perry 
indeed that attribution to perry is a strength of the volume 
which takes three paragraphs to note that the same quote has also 
been attributed to many other historical figures 
it is intriguing to speculate the compilers comment in their 
introduction what circumstances could have led members of congress 
to request such quotes as 
if you give me six lines written in the hand of the most 
honest of men i will find something in them which will hang him 
cardinal richelieu of france 
never explain your friends do not need it and your enemies 
will not believe you anyway american writer and editor elbert 
hubbard 
politicians are the same all over they promise to build a 
bridge even where there is no river nikita khrushchev 
he has been called a mediocre man but this is unwarranted 
flattery he was a politician of monumental littleness theodore 
roosevelt discussing president john tyler 
it is a sin to believe evil of others but it is seldom a 
mistake american writer and critic hl mencken 
i didnt say that i didnt say it i said that i didnt say 
that i said it i want to make that very clear former michigan

interim president ion iliescu said 
monday the army and police should have more power to curb protests 
because violent antigovernment demonstrations could lead to 
anarchy and a new dictatorship 
more than 300 people staged a rally monday evening but this one 
was well away from government headquarters sundays target 
after 12 armored personnel carriers and hundreds of soldiers 
blocked access 
one soldier who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
unlike sunday when the army was caught unprepared by the angry 
demonstrators soldiers now had very specific orders to let no 
one near the building 
about 5000 miners rallied on monday in support of the 
government angrily demanding an end to protests that culimnated 
sunday when about 500 people ransacked government headquarters 
smashing windows and doors with rocks and iron carpet rods 
some miners attacked bystanders with sticks at least four 
onlookers were injured including a grayhaired man rescued from 
the miners by soldiers 
iliescu said the 21member executive bureau of the ruling 
provisional council of national unity decided to propose a law 
increasing the power of those organizations that must maintain 
law and order and defend institutions and citizens against violent 
acts 
he warned that violence unleashed by political passions could 
throw the country into the kind of anarchy that has torn lebanon 
asunder 
if the army and police dont have the legal ability to 
maintain order people will feel it necessary to defend themselves 
we could become like lebanon and anarchy could lead us to total 
chaos he said in an address read on state television 
we appeal for civic responsibility anarchy can only lead to a 
new dictatorship 
iliescu who did not outline the proposed powers sought for the 
army and police spoke amid reports of proleadership 
demonstrations nationwide 
gen dumitru penciuc the nations police commissioner was 
quoted by state radio as saying progovernment rallies were held in 
cluj brasov turda bistrita jiului valley and in bucharest 
the broadcast gave no details 
but state tv showed iliescu meeting with miners and saying the 
antigovernment demonstrators were hooligans hired by foreign 
agents rhetoric strikingly similar to that used by toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu to describe his opposition 
hundreds of protesters stormed government headquarters in 
victory square on sunday in the most violent protest since 
ceausescus ouster and execution in december 
they occupied the building for about three hours briefly 
holding vice prime minister gelu voican voiculescu before hundreds 
of troops arrived to establish order 
the protesters shouted down with communism and down with 
iliescu alleging that the interim president was linked to the 
discredited communist party and that the securitate ceausescus 
secret police continued to operate 
while iliescu was a former ranking communist official he was a 
central committee secretary in charge of propaganda he lost his 
position of power in 1971 after falling afoul of ceausescu 
police on sunday detained 80 of the demonstrators who occupied 
the government building according to executive council spokesman 
dan radulescu he earlier had said 120 people were taken into 
custody and did not account for the discrepancy 
but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said an 
additional 20 people had been detained since sunday on suspicion of 
leading the demonstration 
iliescu said there would be an investigation to identify the 
leaders of sundays protest he described them as circles 
interested in destabilizing the situation in our country and 
restoring the vestiges of the dictatorial regime of ceausescu 
but radulescu later appeared to weaken suspicions of a 
conspiracy behind the assault 
police took down statements as to who sent them and why they 
were there he said of the protesters but they were mostly 
drunk and they were released and probably will not be investigated 
any further 
radulescu said three or four soldiers were injured crushed by 
the mob but denied rumors of deaths 
the news agency rompres had said at least 20 troops were 
severely injured radulescu did not comment on the discrepancy but 
some rompres reports have proved exaggerated in chaotic 
postrevolutionary romania 
earlier monday workers removed debris from sundays protest and 
set new glass panes into the dozens of ornate windows and doorways 
of the government building others wiped slogans off the building 
proclaiming the national salvation front equals the romanian 
communist party 
the front whose collective leadership included iliescu and 
several other former communists who opposed ceausescu controlled 
romania for six weeks after the december uprising before 
reluctantly yielding to opposition pressure to share power pending 
may elections it now governs along with 37 other parties or 
political movements in the provisional council of national unity 
other nonfront members of the leadership joined iliescu in 
condemning sundays violence 
ion minzatu president of the romanian republican party called 
the incident an unfortunate action on the part of unknown 
manipulators which will find retribution in court 
several demonstrators said government agents had instigated 
sundays protest to discredit protesters and justify harsh 
countermeasures

authorities moved to placate separatist 
moslem militants monday by dissolving the legislative assembly of 
jammukashmir state and acknowledging that the 1987 polls in which 
it was elected might have been rigged 
also monday at least three people were killed and six injured 
in confrontations between security forces and moslem protesters 
agitating for the secession of the kashmir valley from 
hindumajority india 
state gov jagmohan said the jammukashmir assembly was being 
dissolved because it had lost its representative character 
the move clears the way for new elections to the assembly which 
could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants 
many of the militants say they were members of political parties 
earlier and began agitating for an independent nation after what 
they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections 
it has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had 
rigged the election jagmohan said in a statement issued in 
srinagar 
in those elections farooq abdullah was voted the chief 
minister the top elected post in the state administration for a 
fiveyear term abdullah resigned from the post on jan 19 to 
protest the appointment of jagmohan as governor of the state 
jagmohan a hindu who uses one name has said that quelling 
militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to 
defuse the separatist movement in the moslemmajority state 
police reported at least three deaths monday as moslem crowds 
violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley 
police officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two 
people were killed and six injured when police opened fire to 
control a rioting mob in the town of bijbehara 30 miles southeast 
of srinagar 
one person was killed in the town of shopian 33 miles south of 
srinagar in another incident of police firing they said 
the deaths raise to at least 103 the number of people killed 
since authorities launched a crackdown on the moslem movement on 
jan 20 most of the victims have been protesters killed in police 
firing on curfew violators 
the movement for secession of kashmir from india is at least 
four decades old but has flared in recent months the state of 
jammukashmir which includes the valley and the plains of jammu to 
the south is indias only moslemmajority state 
india and pakistan have both claimed kashmir since the indian 
subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining 
independence from britain in 1947 
the countries have fought two wars over kashmir and pakistan 
occupies a slice of the valley a unmonitored ceasefire line 
divides the valley into indian and pakistani sectors 
india accuses pakistan of fomenting the trouble in kashmir 
islamabad denies the charge but says the kashmri people have a 
right to selfdetermination 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are moslem 
nationwide moslems comprise 12 percent of the 880 million 
population hindus make up 82 percent

natural carcinogens in meat grain and other 
foods are a far greater danger than pesticides and additives 
accounting for more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet 
a government scientist said monday 
even a minor reduction in these naturally occurring hazards he 
said would surpass the benefits of eliminating all traces of 
dangerous manmade chemicals 
the culprits include not only such recognized health hazards as 
fats and beer but such seemingly innocent products as bread 
yogurt mushrooms and many spices including cinnamon and nutmeg 
the risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet because they 
overwhelm all the others said dr robert j scheuplein director 
of the office of toxicological sciences at the us food and drug 
administration 
this does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that 
people can do much about the hazard instead scheupleins analysis 
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely 
bogus health issue the hazards of chemical contamination 
he contended that the public is worried about the wrong risks in 
their diet in part because of exaggerated news accounts of such 
scares as alar in apples cyanide in grapes and dioxin in milk 
scheuplein based his conclusions on a statistical analysis of 
the quantity of cancercausing agents in the diet 
he said that the risk of dying from cancer from dietary exposure 
to both natural and manmade carcinogens or cancerinducing 
substances was 77 percent the risk from naturally occurring 
carcinogens alone was 76 percent 
most of the risks are peoples personal choices scheuplein 
said they are not imposed on people by corporations apparently 
thats a hard lesson people want to blame somebody 
scheuplein presented his findings at a meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
dr frank young a former fda commissioner who is now deputy 
assistant secretary of health and human services said he agreed 
with scheupleins contention 
the headline should not be all foods cause cancer or drop 
dead dont eat young said the good news is let us not as a 
nation focus just on the technological food additives we ought to 
focus on the big issues as well 
scheuplein said the clearest cancercausing agent in ordinary 
food is fat which has been linked with several kinds of tumors 
however he said most foods now eaten would not pass safety tests 
required for new food chemicals and additives 
he estimated that carcinogens make up onetenth of 1 percent of 
the food people eat among concerns he cited were 
wellcooked highprotein foods such as meat and eggs contain 
bacterial substances that can cause genetic mutations an ordinary 
days protein can be as damaging to the genes as five cigarettes 
hazardous urethane is a natural product of fermentation it is 
present in beer yogurt bread and other foods 
mycotoxins produced by molds are common in many foods 
especially when stored in warm humid conditions aflatoxins occur 
in corn and peanuts zearalenone in soybeans and luteoskyrin in 
yellow rice 
smoked or salted fish and pickled vegetables may cause 
digestive cancers this is attributed to nitrates and funguses 
grilling and charring fish or meat can produce potentially 
hazardous substances such as nitropyrenes 
many spices contain questionable substances there is estragole 
in tarragon eugenal in cloves cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon 
myristicin in nutmeg and anethole in fennel several spices 
including oregano marjoram and bay leaves may cause genetic 
damage 
other naturally occurring carcinogens include dlimonene in 
oranges psoralens in celery hydrazines in mushrooms and nitrates 
in spinach 
even a modestly effective attempt to lessen the dietary risk 
of natural carcinogens would probably be enormously more useful to 
human health than regulatory efforts devoted to eliminating traces 
of pesticide residues or other specific tracelevel chemicals

premier li peng apparently concerned about 
ethnic separatism in the neighboring soviet union ordered that any 
such movements in china be wiped out immediately an official 
report said monday 
a tiny number of separatists under the mantle of nationalism 
and religion oppose socialism and sabotage the unity of all 
chinese nationalities xinhua news agency quoted li as telling 
officials in charge of minority affairs 
we must not relax our vigilance we should wipe out all 
separatist activities while they are still in the embryonic stage 
li spoke last thursday xinhua said the release of speeches is 
often delayed in china 
china has 55 ethnic minority groups who make up a total of 8 
percent of the countrys 11 billion population but the regions 
they inhabit comprise more than 60 percent of chinas territory 
including vast undeveloped steppes and mountain regions on the 
countrys borders 
historically fierce battles were waged among the various 
groups the mongols and the manchus at times defeated the majority 
han and ruled the chinese empire 
since the communists took power in 1949 minority uprisings and 
protests have occurred but have been swiftly put down sometimes 
with bloodshed 
chinese officials have refused to comment publicly on soviet 
ethnic unrest but recently have stepped up calls for unity and 
vigilance against unrest 
officials in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region a huge arid 
region in chinas far northwest said last month they would step up 
antiriot training for police and intensify intelligence work among 
the mostly moslem residents 
the premier ignoring past ethnic clashes said chinas 
minorities share the tradition of loving their motherland and 
safeguarding national unity this is the superior quality and 
spiritual wealth of china 
li did not mention the most strifewracked minority region 
tibet where four clashes with chinese security forces resulted in 
dozens of deaths since october 1987 tibets capital lhasa 
remains under martial law imposed after a clash last march

a murder that may have enraged a mailbomb assassin 
julie love 27 was found shot to death in northwest atlanta 
last august more than a year after her disappearance prompted a 
nationally publicized search

for a competent federal judicial system claiming responsibility 
for the december mailbomb assassinations of a federal judge in 
alabama and a savannah alderman and civil rights attorney

vance and attorney robert robinson in reprisal for atrocities 
inflicted upon julie love the letter also threatened more 
violence in response to crimes by black men against white women 
ms love was white hammond 24 is black 
armed sheriffs deputies were posted in and around the 
ninthfloor courtroom monday at fulton county superior court with 
an extra metal detector outside the room bombsniffing dogs are 
checking the courtroom daily court officials said 
fifty potential jurors were summoned to court after judge ralph 
hicks told them the jury would be sequestered for up to three weeks 
during the trial 25 told him they would be under great hardships 
mostly family or business concerns and were excused 
attorneys for hammond and the prosecution then began questioning 
the remaining potential jurors individually chiefly about their 
feelings on the death penalty and their knowledge and opinions of 
the highly publicized case more potential jurors will be called 
and jury selection may take several days hicks said

marietta resident charged with murder felony murder kidnapping 
and armed robbery

their deliberations 
hammonds cousin william porter pleaded guilty in november to 
felony murder rape kidnapping and armed robbery in the case he 
has not been sentenced and is expected to testify against hammond 
who police contend fired the fatal shot 
the trial originally was to have started jan 30 but was 
postponed because mental competency hearings were not completed in 
time earlier this month hammond was ruled competent to stand 
trial 
ms loves disappearance in july 1988 sparked a huge search that 
included billboards and posters all over the atlanta area with the 
message have you seen julie love many of the prospective

soviet spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
said monday his countrymen are learning their new freedoms by 
trial and error and soviet journalists are rewriting soviet 
history 
gerasimov a speaker at a conference of asian journalists said 
the administrative command system of the past had to be changed 
because it did not suit modern soviet society 
the old system created a large group of educated people who 
asked troublesome questions the kind of questions asked and 
discussed in the privacy of their homes usually in the kitchen 
said gerasimov head of the foreign ministry information department 
he said the soviet press then began rewriting our own history 
so energetically that one deputy in our parliament complained that 
there is nothing more unpredictable than our history 
journalists exposed corruption and bad management everywhere in 
the bureaucracy with such vigor that everyone wondered if there 
are honest people left he said 
all this gave our people the sense of urgency for change and 
the feeling of power to bring this about gerasimov said 
describing that as good news 
gerasimov added however that some people misused 
democratic freedoms because they lacked experience with freedom of 
expression 
in the bad old days of socalled stagnation we followed oscar 
wildes maxim a problem does not exist if it is not talked 
about he said citing unrest in several soviet republics 
rumors have helped create tension in the troubled regions he 
said and told the journalists we used to have no real freedom 
of the press and no conflicts to report now we have more than our 
share of conflicts and we learn the hardest way which is by trial 
and error 
he expressed concern about negative reporting that starts 
the mechanism of selffulfilling prophecies 
soviet journalists have been too shy or too diplomatic to 
write the whole truth about developments in eastern europe 
gerasimov said and described their reporting as insufficient 
reflecting the legacy of easygoing reporting in the past 
about political upheaval in the former soviet satellites he 
said president mikhail s gorbachevs perestroika reform program 
was a signal for a change in their own society but the leaders 
didnt listen the people did

twelve civil servants face similar charges in the 1986 sale of 
9000 tons of yugoslav corn to an eec member in 1986 the corn was 
passed off as greek to avoid trade levies imposed on noneec 
agricultural products and to draw subsidies authorities say 
athanassopoulos denies any wrongdoing saying the coverup was 
the result of a decision taken with other government ministers to 
protect greeces interests 
on monday he claimed his detention was political and not a 
judicial decision

when she danced has a heroine who in real 
life was wildly romantic shamelessly manipulative overly 
melodramatic and fatally extravagant so why is she so difficult to 
capture on stage 
thats one of the themes author martin sherman explores in the 
play a intriguing sliceoflife look at isadora duncan the quirky 
high priestess and great revolutionary of modern dance 
shermans play which opened monday at offbroadways 
playwrights horizons suggests that only those who saw her dance 
could begin to understand the woman 
the comedydrama skillfully blends fact and fiction it takes 
place in isadoras paris apartment in 1923 four years before her 
odd death when she strangled on a long scarf which caught in a 
rear wheel of her openair automobile 
despite the title the playwright doesnt let isadora dance on 
stage how can you recreate what made her great instead he 
suggests what the woman must have been like through her own 
outrageous actions and through the memories of a parade of admirers 
shermans isadora floundering in her mid 40s is down but not 
out particularly in elizabeth ashleys heroic performance a 
portrait that revels in all of isadoras excesses 
at the start of the play the dancer has been married to the 
psychotic russian poet sergei esenin for a year and hopes to 
return to russia where she runs a dance school 
to survive in paris she sells off furniture from the apartment 
and awaits a visa to vienna so she can get back to work she also 
has plans to persuade the italian government to finance a dance 
school in italy 
the playwright surrounds isadora with a menagerie of misfits 
all of them speaking a different language they come together in a 
disastrous hilarious secondact dinner party where the lack of 
communication is the least of the problems 
besides sergei isadoras supper companions include miss belzer 
a mousy russian translator hired to communicate with sergei 
alexandros a young greek pianist who worships isadora mary a 
rich american friend in charge of what is left of isadoras waning 
career luciano an italian government official and christine an 
ungainly swedish girl who is an awkward discipline of duncans 
distinctive dance technique 
the play is just as much about these peoples remembrances of 
isadora as about the lady herself sherman is particularly adept at 
evoking the joy isadoras dances brought to people throughout the 
evening he stops the action so her admirers can soliloquize about 
her unique talent 
especially affecting is marcia jean kurtz as the comic but 
forlorn miss belzer a refugee from the russian revolution in her 
performance kurtz distills the worship isadora evoked 
marcia lewis gets every laugh she can from the role of mary 
isadoras confidante but jonathan walker is not always convincing 
as isadoras maniacal younger husband 
tim luscombe a young british director who made his broadway 
debut earlier in the season with tom stoppards artist descending 
a staircase handles the shift in action from tragedy to 
melodrama to farce with ease 
the autumnal setting a decaying apartment designed by steven 
rubin and filled with fading golds browns and grays suggests the 
disintegration of isadoras career 
i can not explain says the greek pianist portrayed with 
touching enthusiasm by robert sean leonard as he tries to describe 
what made isadoras dancing so extraordinary neither can sherman 
but he has built a fascinating play that nevertheless celebrates 
her elusive art

vaclav havel the dissident playwright who 
went from prison to the presidency of czechoslovakia inside of 
eight months will meet with president bush on tuesday the first 
of eastern europes new democratic leaders to visit the white house 
havel arrived here monday evening after stops in iceland and 
canada on a western trip that comes conspicuously a week before his 
first trip to moscow 
the czech parliament elected havel president dec 29 a few 
weeks after a peaceful revolution led to the ouster of communist 
party chief milos jakes and his hardline government 
now the country under havels caretaker government is 
preparing for june 8 parliamentary elections that will be its first 
free balloting in more than 40 years 
havel has said he is coming west not to look for charity but 
investment in a country that already maintains a standard of living 
well above that of poland its neighbor to the north 
czechoslovakia is not looking for us aid they are not in 
the same economic dire straits that poland has been in a 
senior bush administration official said 
shirley temple black the us ambassador to czechoslovakia 
agreed 
what they want is mainly language help mrs black told 
reporters after she accompanied havel on the helicopter trip from 
andrews air force base to washington they want to know about 
managing in other words how to do it they didnt come for the 
money 
after arriving havel spent about 15 minutes in a very 
cordial meeting at blair house with secretary of state james a 
baker iii said havels press secretary michael zantovsky 
in a visit to canada before coming to washington the czech 
prime minister marian calfa signed agreements with quebec premier 
robert bourassa for cooperation in hydroelectricity pulp and paper 
and other areas 
in a whirlwind sevenhour visit to the czech and slovak 
communities of toronto on monday havel received an honorary degree 
from york university bestowed on him in absentia in 1982 when he 
had little chance to leave the country 
baker in a brief visit to prague feb 6 already signaled 
support for giving czechoslovakia mostfavorednation trade status 
and allowing it to rejoin the international monetary fund it was a 
founding member of the imf but was evicted after the 1948 
communist takeover 
and if congress approves czechoslovakia would share in a pool 
of 300 million in new aid the bush administration has requested 
for the emerging democracies in eastern europe 
the united states has already announced plans to reopen its 
consulate shuttered for more than four decades in bratislava in the 
slovak region of czechoslovakia 
the administration also expects to expand exchanges and possibly 
dispatch peace corps volunteers to czechoslovakia said the 
official who briefed white house reporters on the havel visit 
the new czech government is prodding the soviets to remove their 
73500 troops as quickly as possible sharing borders with both 
east and west germany czechoslovakia also has no small stake in 
the thrust toward german reunification 
the czechs favor a europe that is democratic and in which 
germany plays a role but not necessarily a dominant role said 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the new government has also said it plans to quit selling arms 
to countries engaged in hostilities and eventually stop exporting 
arms altogether the czechs have been a supplier for cuba and 
nicaragua 
havel favors a gradual abolition of the warsaw pact and 
some members of his government have said nato should dissolve too 
bush will try to convince havel that nato still has a role to play 
in keeping europe stable and peaceful 
havel 53 spent five years in czech prisons and his plays were 
banned for nearly two decades for his defense of human rights and 
liberty 
he succeeded gustav husak who became president a year after 
backing the soviet invasion of august 1968 husak relinquished 
power without a fight in the face of massive protests in wenceslas 
square by students and the civic forum opposition group 
bush after a private chat with havel in the oval office and 
together with top ministers in the cabinet room will hold a 
private luncheon for havel 
on wednesday havel will address a joint session of congress 
then travel to new york for a round of business political and 
cultural contacts that includes a rock concert in his honor he 
leaves for home thursday night 
while havel is the first of eastern europes new officeholders 
to visit the white house bush gave the presidential medal of 
freedom one of americas highest honors to lech walesa of 
polands solidarity movement last nov 10

appreciates a suarez for governor tshirt but has no plans to 
challenge gov bob martinez this year 
the thirdterm mayor met last month with republican foes of 
martinez who encouraged suarez to challenge the gop governor 
i have consulted my family and myself and have concluded that

statewide office suarez said 
i also take seriously the mandate of my constituents who 
placed their trust in my leadership as mayor during the next four 
years he said 
suarez was elected in november to a new fouryear term he said 
he was impressed by attention from members of martinez own party 
attention that may have laid a foundation for him to seek a 
statewide office in the future 
it was nice to know that a lot of people knew who i was and 
had a favorable opinion suarez said 
martinez a firstterm governor elected in 1986 called suarezs 
decision good news 
were of course delighted he will continue to be mayor of the 
city of miami the governor said its always good for someone 
to stay in the office they hold 
suarez father of four said the timing of a statewide race 
wasnt right for his family 
he said his nonexistent gubernatorial campaign was bolstered by 
letters from supporters and even a suarez for governor tshirt 
suarez worked on president bushs campaign in 1988 and worked 
for martinez in 1986 but has supported several democratic 
candidates in other races 
republican state sen marlene woodsonhoward has announced plans 
to challenge martinez in the republican primary in september on 
the democratic side us rep bill nelson state sen george

sunday prompting the evacuation of two residents by helicopter 
said jack minassian fire management officer at hawaii volcanoes 
national park 
the homes are in the royal gardens subdivision on hawaii island

homes in royal gardens and neighboring subdivisions only four 
homes remain in royal gardens the home destroyed saturday has been 
vacant since its resident left the subdivision in 1983 
another finger of lava east of royal gardens crossed the 
kalapana bypass highway but headed for the ocean over old flows and 
did not threaten homes minassian said

he expressed dismay that there were no cleanup crews on the 
beach in newport despite oil coating rocky outcroppings there 
marino said government agencies must first approve the cleanup 
methods used 
proposed cleanup methods were expected to be demonstrated for 
the coast guard and state department of fish and game on tuesday 
he said 
theyre talking about using sea water heated to 85 degrees 
which is warm enough to liquefy the petroleum on the rocks but 
wouldnt cook any creatures said newport fire capt ray

the trump vs trump marital fight can only be 
made worse by all the headlines it has generated cardinal john 
oconnor said after meeting with one of the two warring parties 
publicity makes everything more difficult than it would be 
otherwise oconnor said sunday 
i think every problem that any of us have once its 
publicized its almost by definition magnified and the more 
visible one is the more intense any problem is said the roman 
catholic cardinal 
on friday the cardinal met with ivana trump but he would not 
say what was discussed during their 45minute meeting 
but asked what advice he would give to somebody whose marriage 
was threatened oconnor said pray 
multimillionaire donald trump who was reported last week to 
have split with his wife of nearly 13 years had sought counseling 
from the minister of marble collegiate church arthur caliandro 
the associated press reported last week 
mrs trump who turned 41 on monday flew friday to the couples 
117room mansion in palm beach fla where trump joined her 
sunday trump 43 returned to new york on monday after a 
wonderful trip said his spokesman howard rubenstein 
the visit had an atmosphere full of love rubenstein quoted 
trump as saying the children ivana and the family were very 
cordial and he had a wonderful time

owners of 60 oil tankers that regularly 
sail the florida straits agreed to keep at least six miles away 
from fragile reefs in the florida keys gov bob martinez said 
monday 
fifteen of the nations largest petroleum companies agreed 
voluntarily to observe the buffer zone to safeguard against 
groundings and oil spills martinez told reporters 
the coral reefs will be a much safer place he said 
martinez was joined by ed roland chairman of the marine 
transportation committee of the american petroleum institute 
roland president of amoco transport co called the agreement 
a major step in further safeguarding the southern florida 
environment 
ships sailing from the atlantic ocean into the gulf of mexico 
sometimes hug the reefs often sailing along coral banks to avoid 
fueleating currents of the gulf stream 
the agreement effective april 1 calls for ships to stay 10 
nautical miles 12 miles on land from the shoreline and five 
nautical miles six land miles from the edge of shallow reefs 
the move to put more distance between ships sailing between 
florida and cuba started last fall when three cargo ships ran 
aground on the 200mile string of barrier reefs that stretch from 
south of miami past key west to the dry tortugas 
there were no spills in the three incidents 
in addition to the 60 tankers 250 ships owned by the 15 
companies will keep their distance during infrequent trips through 
the straits 
roland said he couldnt estimate the cost of the program but 
said it will require extra time and fuel 
more than 5000 passages are made through the straits a year 
some by ships carrying as much as 21 million gallons of oil at a 
time

a hushhush countdown ticked away 
today for the thursday launch of space shuttle atlantis with a spy 
satellite that reportedly will help monitor soviet compliance with 
armscontrol agreements 
a soviet official on an unprecedented tour of the kennedy space 
center on sunday said with a smile the shuttles classified payload 
was a waste of money as his country has no special secrets 
after announcing that the launch clock had started sunday night 
nasa pulled a curtain of secrecy over the countdown because of the 
shuttles secret satellite 
the count will be made public just nine minutes before the 
planned liftoff on thursday officials have said only that the 
launch will take place between midnight and 4 am but sources 
close to the program report atlantis and its crew of five military

the widespread adoption of existing 
energysaving technology could cut us energy use by 75 percent 
solving the globalwarming problem profitably a researcher says 
improvements in energyefficient devices have come along so 
quickly that they now create astonishing potential savings 
said amory lovins director of research at the rocky mountain 
institute in snowmass colo 
he said his studies show the proper use of energy efficiency can 
outpace the current growth in the worlds population which stands 
at 53 billion 
a world of 8 billion people with a standard of living equal to 
that of west germany and an economy five times the current size 
could survive on onethird the energy that is being consumed 
worldwide now lovins said

when it comes to bedroom habits americans 
are a rather staid lot a new survey concludes 
on average adults say they have sex once a week if they are 
married its almost invariably with their spouse and they 
overwhelmingly eschew homosexuality 
this shows that the sexual behavior of americans is more 
circumspect and traditional than the libertine impression we get 
from the popular media and fiction said tom w smith of the 
university of chicago who directed the survey 
a separate study shows that teenage boys as well are not 
living up to their reputations it found that adolescents seem to 
be having sex less often with fewer girls and at a later age than 
teenagers did a decade ago 
this contrasts sharply with the view that most young men are 
sexually promiscuous said fredya l sonenstein of the urban 
institute in washington who analyzed the results

when the census bureau sets out to count 
americans in a few weeks workers will have all new maps the 
result of a massive cartographic cooperation by government agencies 
the project was undertaken because its not enough for the 
census to just count everyone every 10 years it also has to report 
where they are 
since 1983 the us geological survey and the census bureau have 
worked together to compile a new set of computerized maps known as 
tiger for topologically integrated geographic encoding and 
referencing 
censustakers for years were plagued by old and inaccurate maps 
sometimes setting forth with nothing more detailed than highway 
department road maps

in the taunting chatter of the dugout theyd 
call it rabbit ears ballpark slang for the way some players seem 
to hear every boo and jeer no matter how long and loud the cheers 
of the fans this condition now appears to be afflicting a retired 
ivy league first baseman 
but then george bush has company among presidents as well as 
ballplayers theyd like the applause to be unanimous and they 
keep going to bat anyhow 
so hours after bush said on the way to the cartagena drug summit 
that he was going to change his ways and stop holding so many press 
conferences he held numbers 38 and 39 
the presidential pique apparently stemmed from critical accounts 
of his comments at no 37 on monday feb 12 which turned out the 
next day to have been misleading at best 
on wednesday he said he hadnt known that what he said wouldnt 
survive a days events on thursday irked the president said he 
was going to change his ways and stop holding so many 
questionandanswer sessions because he wasnt going to get burned 
any more 
bush has been holding presidential press conferences at a rate 
never approached in the era of televised questions and answers 
theres been nothing like it since the early years of lyndon b 
johnsons presidency and many of his sessions were off camera 
bush was supposed to have trouble with communications at least 
by comparison with the smooth old professional ronald reagan and 
he has spent a year proving otherwise 
and its working thirteen months into his term bush has poll 
approval ratings far beyond those of his predecessors reagan 
included his job performance is gaining the approval of 75 to 80 
percent in the major public opinion surveys all those news 
conferences have helped build that standing 
but that constant exposure can be wearing even grating 
especially when it leads to adverse commentary about the answers 
some of which have indeed been misleading 
hence the rebuke which wasnt unusual although such flareups 
usually come when a president is having political trouble bushs 
political stock is up so there is not likely to be a major shift 
in the way he does business communication included its working 
too well for that 
among the specific items on which bush comments have turned out 
to be misleading 
the president said feb 12 that he didnt think it was time for 
a conference of the four allied powers of world war ii on german 
reunification not at this juncture the next day the united 
states the soviet union britain and france agreed on such a 
conference 
long after the administration has started planning for what 
became the malta summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev bush 
said no such plans were in the works he then said there would be 
no set agenda for malta and went there with 21 proposals to be 
discussed 
shortly after the administration banned highlevel exchange 
visits with china because of the military crackdown on democracy 
demonstrators two bush aides were sent on a secret mission to 
beijing they went again in december bush took shelter in 
semantics saying he hadnt banned contacts only exchanges 
episodes like those have led to complaints that bush and his 
aides sometimes mislead the press and therefore the public in order 
to maintain secrecy on things they arent ready to announce there 
are other ways to handle the problem as secretary of state james 
a baker iii said after acknowledging a televised misstatement on 
china he could and should have said no comment 
bush did a lot of no commenting as he lectured reporters aboard 
air force one on the way to colombia i hate to be secretive to 
say nothing of deceptive he said choosing the words his critics 
had used 
i think we have too many press conferences he said its 
not good its overexposure to the thing 
so from now on its going to be a little different 
later that day white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said the president had only been kidding 
i think the president had it backwards said chief of staff 
john sununu im supposed to be the bad cop

the pilgrims ate what they could grow because 
they had to centuries later the restaurant that is the mecca of 
california cuisine demands what the pilgrims were stuck with 
locally grown ingredients 
a moveable feast to be broadcast wednesday as part of 
public televisions smithsonian world series traces the circle of 
taste and necessity that shaped our eating habits 
its sort of an explanation of how the things that happened 
happened its not really about food its about transportation 
growing seasons social habits lloyd dobyns the programs 
writer and narrator said in a telephone interview from his north 
carolina home 
viewers get a fascinating tour around the united states and 
through history from the pilgrims introduction to indigenous 
american foods to the eating revolution wrought by the railroads 
dobyns tells how the people who run the air force academys 
cafeteria feed each cadet for 380 a day and why the patrons of 
new york citys 21 club pay nearly three times that for a 
hamburger alice waters and one of the farmers who provide for her 
restaurant chez panisse show off the glorious produce that fills 
her california kitchen 
a moveable feast produced and directed by rolfe tessem is 
the first offering from linda ellerbees lucky duck productions 
company she and dobyns coanchored nbc news overnight 
the show starts off a little slow with a reenactment of a 
17thcentury feast at plimoth plantation in massachusetts but it 
makes the point that each wave of immigrants to this country 
brought a food culture it learned to blend into what was available 
what you ate was dictated by where you ate and what you could 
grow dobyns explains in the program so the pilgrims learned 
about corn roast american eagle which miles standish compares 
to mutton and at least 200 types of fish and seafood 
little changed for 200 years until trains carried food to 
stores thousands of miles from the farms and with that 
development a moveable feast becomes a delightful journey 
too with wonderful film clips and characters 
in 1880 the first year of the refrigerator car 7 million tons 
of food was shipped says jack white senior transportation 
historian at the smithsonian institution this radically changed 
the american diet 
the railroad helped to carry us from an agricultural to an 
industrial society dobyns says the railroads did one thing 
more as they were born so was the fast food chain 
harvey houses founded by fred harvey offered clean tables 
reliable food and uniformed waitresses along the railroad lines 
immortalized by judy garland in the 1945 mgm musical the harvey 
girls 
it was the railroad that created a national menu not food 
not taste its one of those things that you say gee i knew 
that but no you didnt dobyns said in the interview 
the american love of gadgets was requited many times over in the 
kitchen machines to pour pancake batter toasters that toast more 
slices of bread plenty of inventions were supposed to make women 
happier in their kitchens and theres a newsreel of the kitchen 
of tomorrow a pushbutton dream coming true for mrs housewife 
but another invention the automobile was taking people out 
of their homes dick mcdonald tells how his carhop restaurant in 
california was transformed into the first burger joint under the 
golden arches 
we thought this was really going to be a sensation he says 
a moveable feast moves to the present to another kitchen 
where the burger is famous and the work fast a meal a minute at 
lunch but the results very different at the tony 21 club in 
manhattan here is food as power and status orson welles at the 
bar a wine cellar with bottles marked as belonging to the likes of 
elizabeth taylor 
then on to food as sustenance the us air force academy 
kitchens a ton of produce a day astonishing vats of hot cereal 
and chili an enormous grill of scrambled eggs 
for all those developments food just didnt taste as good as it 
should to alice waters who opened chez panisse in berkeley 
calif in 1971 
we wanted to cook the way we had eaten in france yet we 
didnt have the foodstuffs to cook with she says 
what could be had however was the bounty of california farms 
and at chez panisse the farmer has become as important as the chef 
in determining what is served the salad greens are picked that 
day the tomatoes used depend on what is flown up from the chino 
family farm in southern california 
i think its very important to connect people with the source 
of their food waters says and as a result chez panisse winds 
up nearly where the pilgrims started with fresh seasonal local 
food

mind you im no purist when it comes to 
pesticide i grew up on a mississippi cotton farm in a cloud of 
ddt making war on the boll weevil no ddt no cotton we figured 
then there was the time a couple of years ago that my elderly 
nextdoor neighbor defoliated his entire garden by following my 
advice on how to get rid of white flies without resorting to 
heavyduty poisons 
but let me back up 
my neighbor pete you see is an italianamerican who grew up 
on manhattans lower east side and was a metalworker until he 
retired to the suburbs and became the star gardener of the baxter 
park neighborhood even had his picture in the local paper with 
some of his yardlong beans for which he saves the seeds from year 
to year 
then about five years ago i moved in a former member of the 
yalobusha county future farmers of america who cultivated 4h club 
acresized cotton and corn patches with a muledrawn shovelstock 
plow a son of southern soil i was now reduced to backyard 
vegetable gardening in new england with a shorter growing season 
and limited space 
the first time i saw pete was around st patricks day when i 
went outside and started digging my raised beds a new copy of 
square foot gardening in hand i dug eight plots each 6 feet by 6 
feet bordered with 4inch by 4inch treated timbers in each i 
dumped about 2 cubic feet of peat moss a 40pound bag of 
storebought composted and dehydrated cow manure and half a coffee 
can of 5105 commercial fertilizer 
seems like youre going to an awful lot of trouble and 
expense said pete whose own garden plot butted up against mine 
but a few mornings later i discovered that petes entire garden 
was covered with a 6inch layer of cow manure the real stuff 
from his soninlaws upstate farm 
the battle was joined 
i started setting out broccoli plants one per square foot as 
the book says 
youre planting those too close together pete advised 
what does a new yorker know about farming i thought 
around mothers day i started transplanting my tomato plants 
supersteaks that i had started from seed on my glassedin back 
porch i planted them about 18 inches apart with a 6foot trellis 
to grow on 
youre planting those too close together pete advised 
now fastforward to midjuly 
pete was right about the broccoli crowded each other out 
he was wrong about the tomatoes he had nothing to compare with 
my supersteaks some weighing around 3 pounds plentiful and tasty 
then came the white fly caper 
one saturday afternoon i saw pete getting ready to go after the 
pests with malathion 
pete you know you can get rid white flies with a mild mixture 
of water and liquid soap like ivory and its a lot cheaper i 
advised 
the cheaper got his attention 
now i dont know how much soap pete used or what kind but the 
next morning his garden was wilted in a few days leaves were 
turning brown and falling off to his credit he didnt yell at me 
summer before last came the invasion of the japanese beetles in 
swarms not seen here in years mating and munching away when they 
started devouring my okra a southern delicacy rarely found fresh 
in yankee grocery stores it was time to bring out the heavy 
artillery sevin it worked 
last summer im happy to report i used neither soap nor sevin 
every year is different in backyard gardening last year for 
example pete had ripe tomatoes two weeks earlier than i did and 
more plentiful but my zucchini for the first time was more 
productive 
one more thing about pete and me he never could understand why 
i want to grow okra i feel the same way about his figs figs like 
okra just arent cut out for connecticut climate thats why every 
fall pete goes to great pains to wrap his puny little fig trees in 
plastic tying them snugly to fend off the freeze 
seems like youre going to an awful lot of trouble i always 
advise him

radar is being used to spy on insects measuring their numbers 
when they fly how high and how long they stay in the air 
a team of u s department of agriculture scientists is using 
radar which can spot an airplane or a thunderstorm 40 miles away 
to improve pest control strategies by helping predict mass insect 
migration 
among their findings 
mild wind convergences can concentrate insects into lines 
several miles wide and many miles long 
night flying insects often fly in layers if temperatures and 
wind conditions are favorable as many as five layers of insects 
have been detected at one time 
in a georgia radar sample most insects were found to fly 
uniformly rather than swarm densities were greatest a few hours 
after sunset 
scientists have long known that insects move vast distances in 
masses but only recently have they had technology including radar 
to confirm it they hope information from their studies can be 
applied to pest control strategies that will help save chemicals 
equipment labor and consequently money 
theres a big ocean up there transporting insects says 
wayne w wolf an agricultural engineer on the usdas agricultural 
research service team based at tifton ga 
the radar right now is not capable of discriminating between 
specific insects but it can give estimates of total numbers in the 
air wolf adds 
others on the team include entomologist sammy d pair and 
meteorologist john westbrook 
basic radar equipment is trailermounted and beamed at various 
altitudes to detect insects the equipment can scan as low as 10 
feet or for more than mile depending on ground cover terrain and 
insect size a corn earworm moth can be tracked for about 1 miles 
the scientists say that insects tracked by radar are too big to 
be supported by air currents alone so they must actively fly to 
stay aloft even so insects go to higher altitudes where wind 
currents help carry them the researchers are trying to find out if 
insects modify their behavior in response to changes in air 
pressure temperature and winds they want to be able to predict 
mass movements in air currents 
the corn earworm a species of moth that invades corn and cotton 
fields is one of the insects studied by the ars it reports that 
the radar has shown that the insects travel mostly by night 
taking off from farms in south texas and northeast mexico riding 
warm winds north to targets hundreds of miles away flying a few 
thousand feet above the ground they come each year billions of 
them invading corn and cotton fields throughout the texas high 
plains oklahoma louisiana and the missisippi delta 
during one twoweek period researchers say an estimated 65 
billion corn earworm moths left the lower rio grande valley for 
points north 
according to alton n sparks of the ars team near weslaco 
texas documenting the migratory behavior of insects could lead 
to more efficient control programs and an early warning system that 
alerts farmers to when and where infestations are most likely to 
occur 
he believes that farmers might be cutting more deeply into 
profits than necessary with blanketapproach spraying to pest 
control done when the infestation already is under way with 
better information they can attack a pest like the corn earworm 
when its population level is at its lowest before it increases and 
starts spreading over a wider area 
timely use of control measures at this point something that 
would require cooperation between the united states and mexico 
would be the best way to control the pests according to the teams 
the scientists use a narrowbeam radar that can spot a single 
1inch moth flying over a mile away were perfecting our 
equipment so that one day well be able to electronically sort and 
count all the different kinds of insects in flight says wolf 
depending on the numbers size and brightness radar blips can 
represent just a few insects or several thousand during periods of 
heavy migration the engineers have tracked as many as 50000 
insects per hour and 16 million in a mile most of the moths take 
off at dusk and then before sunup drop out of the air currents 
landing on corn or cotton fields to feed and breed 
another radar aboard a plane measures how long the moths fly and 
how much moth density decreases downwind from the source fields 
when radar readings indicate a high density of insects a plane 
fitted with large nets collects samples to determine how many of 
the insects being tracked are actually the worn earworm moths 
weather balloons also profile the atmospheric environment 
surrounding the moths temperature humidity air pressure 
windspeed and direction 
the teams say that these insects cruise in layers 500 to 5000 
feet above ground with a favorable wind the moths might travel as 
far as 200 miles in five to 10 hours 
ars also is studying the fall army worm these moths fly north 
each spring from southern florida to lay eggs in grain and forage 
crops in other states and canada 
nonpest insects like honeybees also are being tracked to 
learn more about their mating behavior 
drones or male bees are hard to track while mating says dr 
gerlad m loper ars plant physiologist at tucson ariz until 
now the only way we could pinpoint the concentration of drones was 
to tie a honey bee queen to a balloon or kite and start walking 
when we got near a drone concentration the males would suddenly 
appear near the queen this method of tracking is very inefficient 
and unpredictable our radar detected several of these 
hardtofind columnshaped swarms up to a halfmile away

would you like a giraffe in your garden or a unicorn perhaps 
or a grouping of neat geometric figures an orb a triangle a 
spiral 
or how about setting your guests adrift in a maze or giving 
your herb garden a bit of pizazz by making it into a knot 
the gardener with patience work and imagination can do all 
these things 
but before undertaking such a project you may want to find out 
what others have created in these special gardens 
many botanical gardens and others open to the public around the 
country have knot gardens a formal style of arrangement of herbs 
popular in elizabethan times one at brooklyn botanic garden in new 
york for example is an exact replica of a garden described by a 
16th century writer thomas hill under the pen name dydymus 
mountaine in his book gardeners labyrinth 
topiary is the art of pruning and training plants into 
sculptured shapes a master of that art was the late harvey s 
ladew who became intrigued by topiary during visits to england 
his gardens in monkton md were developed between 1929 and 1971 
and include a hunting scene a chinese junk winston chrchills hat 
and vforvictory sign a unicorn and sea lions 
back in the 1870s massachusetts industrialist thomas e brayton 
purchased an estate on the shores of narragansett bay in 
portsmouth ri because he wanted a topiary garden his garden 
green animals has more than 60 topiary pieces including a camel 
giraffe and elephant started 70 years ago and a horse and rider 
dating back more than 40 years 
both the ladew and green animals gardens are open to the public 
and other examples of topiary can be found in other public gardens 
topiary reached the height of its popularity in europe in the 
17th century a period when mazes also were in vogue 
but the concept of the maze or labyrinth is far older than 
that according to greek mythology daedalus built a labyrinth on 
crete for king minos in which to house the minotaur and egyptian 
king amenemhat iii built himself a funeral temple in the form of a 
labyrinth 
but these were not garden mazes the garden variety made from 
growing plants is traced back to the stillflourishing specimen 
at hampton court palace outside london it was laid out around 
1700 when king william iii lived there an estimated halfmillion 
tourists visit it each year 
in rydal pa h thomas hallowell jr built himself a smaller 
version of the hampton court maze in the 1940s as a way to use 
1600 english boxwood plants it too is still in fine shape 
though it is not usually open to the public 
anyone can see the labyrinth in new harmony ind it is a 
replica or possibly the original planted there by the harmonists 
or rappites followers of the german separatist george rapp rapp 
founded this separatist model community on the wabash river in the 
early 19th century but later moved on leaving his maze which may 
have symbolized obstacles that have to be overcome to find the 
meaning of life the tower in the center rough on the exterior 
attractively furnished within symbolized ultimate achievement 
and colonial williamsburg visited by countless people every 
year also has a maze at the governors palace 
but how about making your own knot garden topiary figures or 
maze 
the knot garden probably will be the simplest 
here are some pointers from bernard currid in herbs amp their 
ornamental uses published by the brooklyn ny botanic garden 
first draw a plan visualizing both pattern and color mark it 
off in squares covering the dimensions of the available plot 
in planning remember that most of the herbs youll be using 
like light welldrained soil and full sun 
herbs should be compact by nature and able to withstand 
trimming and the foliage should be sufficiently varied in color to 
delineate the various features of the knot 
plants mentioned by currid include gray and green santolinas 
germander winter savory a form of lemon thyme with leaves edged 
in white hyssop roman wormwood edging box dwarf forms of 
lavender and golden variegated sage 
gardeners contemplating topiary should start by pruning the 
plant roughly into shape according to the bbgs handbook 
trained and sculptured plants once the plant is established 
yearly clipping is necessary to maintain and refine a clear 
outline but dont prune topiary in late autumn or winter in areas 
where freezing weather may occur it could damage the plant 
plants favored for topiary are boxwood yew hemlock privet and 
arborvitae privet is not an evergreen and it may not look 
attractive in winter 
topiary also needs plenty of water to keep it in shape during 
hot summer weather so the gardener who cannot supply it shouldnt 
attempt it 
for mazes boxwood is a favorite plant the labyrinth at new 
harmony is made of amoor river privet noted for its hardiness the 
hampton court maze is yew and the colonial williamsburg maze is 
holly 
patience is the key for these projects it takes time for the 
work to look its best 
the boxwood plants in hallowells maze in pennsylvania grow 
about an inch each year they were about 6 inches high when he 
planted them in the 1940s and are now about four feet high

should you seed your lawn in the spring or fall 
natures way is usually best and autumn seeding comes closest 
to duplicating natural conditions says eliot c roberts of the 
lawn institute in pleasant hill tenn 
by this time of year temperatures are cooling off days are 
getting shorter and soil moisture is ideal for germination of seed 
and early seedling establishment 
at this time many annual weeds like crabgrass have finished 
their growth cycles and will not compete with seedling lawngrass 
plants he adds 
the ideal time to plant a new lawn or overseed one that has 
suffered through an unfavorable summer is four to six weeks before 
the first autumn frost lawns started or improved then will be 
ready for sturdy growth through the fall 
the lawn institute can provide names of lawngrasses for your 
area send an sase envelope to the institute at po box 108

warning watering can be harmful to your lawns health 
watering helps to keep your lawn green and healthy but if you 
dont do it right it can do more harm than good gardening experts 
say 
lawns only need about an inch of water each week to stay green 
says linda neill a spokeswoman for the gilmour group manufacturer 
of lawn and garden products grass like any other plant can be 
ruined by too much water only add whats needed when natural 
rainfall hasnt done the job 
climatic factors such as temperature wind velocity humidity 
and the frequency of rain along with choice of soil and grass 
types will dictate water needs she says 
for best results water when the soil has dried 2 to 6 inches 
deep the company advises another way to tell when a lawn needs 
watering is to watch the grass noting when it shows signs of 
wilting or has lost its normal green color 
other watering tips 
the best time to water a lawn is early morning although late 
night may be equally effective in some areas 
different soil types need different watering schedules clay 
soils hold more water while sandy soils drain more quickly and 
need to be watered more often 
mowing the grass too short puts it under stress and creates a 
shallow root system shallow roots do not absorb moisture well set 
the mower blades higher and mow less frequently so grass roots will 
grow deeper into the soil

here is a fourseason recipe for producing a nice green lawn 
experts at om scott amp sons co lawn specialists recommend 
feeding your lawn four times a year for best results 
early spring by the end of april your lawn is on the move 
grass plants send out new shoots from their bases underground 
rhizomes form offshoot plants and new roots tap moisture and 
nutrients gardeners then stimulate this activity by applying 
nutrients at about this time 
unfortunately crabgrass and other annual weeds also are on the 
move thats why scott recommends applying a combination lawn 
fertilizer and crabgrass preventer apply the product by the fourth 
mowing or before temperatures are regularly in the 80s 
when planting a new lawn or repairing major bare spots use a 
special fertilizer formulated for starting seeds sod or sprigs 
late spring by june grass plants will have consumed nutrients 
applied earlier another feeding helps grass stay green thick and 
fortified through the hot tough summer months ahead 
its likely that a few extras like dandelions plantain and 
clover will appear on your lawn wait until these weeds are 
actively growing before clearing them out since rapid weed growth 
usually occurs in time for the second lawn feeding it makes sense 
to use a good combination broadleaf weed control plus fertilizer at 
this time 
summer during june july and august your lawn will probably 
endure heat and perhaps a few insects replenishing the nutrient 
supply at this time will stimulate top growth thinned by heat and 
lack of moisture nutrients will also promote production of new 
leaves and offshoot plants insects will thrive near the root zone 
so apply a combination insect control plus fertilizer product and 
water it in to carry active ingredients down to the root zone 
late fall the years last feeding should be applied by 
november this helps winterize the lawn and keep it greener longer 
as winter approaches also grass plants fed in fall produce and 
store carbohydrates for immediate use in early spring allowing the 
lawn to green and thicken earlier and faster 
four feedings are suggested for most grass varieties including 
kentucky bluegrass ryegrass fescue and st augustine grass there 
are a few exceptions apply three feedings spring summer and 
fall to centipedegrass zoysia or bahia grass five feedings are 
recommended for bermuda grass in florida and mixed dichondragrass 
lawns 
because they turn green sooner in spring and stay green longer 
in the fall than other grasses cool season grasses are recommended 
for northern areas 
zoysia and bermuda grass are used through much of the transition 
zone between north and south even though their growth period is 
shortened by cool spring and fall weather in these instances 
their increased tolerance of summer heat and drought stress make 
them more reasonable to maintain 
in more northern locations bermuda grasses not only have a 
short growing season but also are more subject to winter kill 
zoysias are hardier in winter but growth usually is restricted to 
the frostfree period 
in choosing a grass for your lawn bluegrases fine fescues 
perennial ryegrasses turftype tall fescues and colonial 
bentgrasses will provide longer periods of green turf in northern 
locations 
these same grasses are adapted to fall winter and spring 
conditions in the transition zone and upper south but they suffer 
from hot summer conditions and are increasingly difficult to keep 
healthy further south zoysia and bermuda grass are used 
effectively in these locations

environmentalist researchers are seeking new answers to the 
question of what to do with grass clippings from mowing the lawn 
according to estimates of the environmental protection agency 
grass clippings and leaves account for more than 18 percent of 
household waste sent to landfills most of it grass clippings 
most homeowners bag the clippings but a dont bag it study 
from the texas agricultural extension service says that lawns 
actually become healthier when the grass clippings are left there 
in the test 150 fort worth texas homeowners spent the summer 
of 1989 mowing their lawns with identical sidedischarge toro 
lawnmowers at the end of the summer participants rated their 
lawns 30 percent healthier than when they were bagging clippings 
according to bill knoop turfgrass specialist for the extension 
service tampa fla minneapolis and los angeles are among cities 
trying similar programs 
another test program was begun last may to compare the benefits 
of a mulching mower to bagging behind a walkbehind mower 
the continuing tests are being conducted by garden way inc and 
the rodale research center in kutztown pa in the testing two 
identical grasscovered plots will be mowed on a weekly basis one 
with a bolens walkbehind mulching mower and the other with a 
bolens walkbehind rear bagging model 
the grass on each plot will be cut the same way each week at 
2to 3inch heights soil cores will be taken before and after each 
growing season then analyzed by the research center staff and 
pennsylvania state university 
the experiment is being conducted because the disposal of 
grass clippings has become a major environmental concern for 
communities all across the country says david lessard vice 
president of product and brand management for garden way we 
believe a mulching mower can offer a very viable and effective 
solution and we wanted to objectively and quantitatively verify 
previous assertions that mulching returns increased nitrogen and 
nutrients to the soil making chemical fertilizer unnecessary 
knoop has this advice for mowing 
mow every five or six days and dont remove more than 
onethird of the grass blade service 
use a recycling lawnmower which has a special deck that cuts 
and recuts clippings and forces them back into the lawn 
fertilize only so grass grows at a reasonable rate use a 
slowrelease fertilizer 
aerate each spring to open up soil and allow greater movement 
of water fertilizer and air this increases the speed of grass 
clipping decomposition 
dont overwater during the driest period of summer lawns 
require one inch of water every five to six days

before all else in gardening is the soil 
healthy garden plants need soil thats full of organic material 
is neutral and drains well this ideal soil however is hard to 
come by and you probably will have to make up the deficits in your 
garden earth the canadian spagnum peat moss news bureau says the 
task isnt as daunting as it sounds and offers some advice for soil 
improvements 
first analyze your soils texture if it runs through your 
fingers its too sandy which will allow water and nutrients to 
drain off too quickly if the soil is thick lumpy and clinging 
you probably have a high clay content plant roots will have a hard 
time penetrating this soil and may starve from lack of air and 
water you can improve texture of any soil by adding organic 
materials such as grass clippings straw hay wood shavings 
chopped leaves dehydrated manure or sphagnum peat moss work a 
layer 2 inches thick into the soil add it in the spring before 
planting and in the fall after harvesting 
check your soils ph or balance between alkalinity or 
acidity you can do this with a kit available at garden centers 
these will measure the balance on a scale of one to 14 with ph 7 
representing a neutral balance numbers below this indicate 
alkaline levels and numbers above represent acidity levels the 
numbers are geometrically progressive so a ph 5 reading is ten 
times as acidic as ph 6 
lawns vegetables and most flowers prefer a neutral or slightly 
acid soil soil that is too acid commonly found in the northeast 
can leach out calcium and magnesium this can be countered by 
adding ground limestone using about 2 pounds per 100 square feet 
of light soil or 3 pounds of hydrated lime or 6 pounds of ground 
limestone per 100 square feet of heavy soil to improve the ph by 
one unit alkaline soil often found in the southwest can be 
balanced with agricultural sulfur about a halfpound per 100 
square feet of light soil or 2 pounds per square feet of heavy soil 
will lower the ph by one unit 
make sure your soil has adequate nutrients the major ones are 
nitrogen n phosophorus p and potassium of potash k 
when shopping for fertilizer note that the bags are labeled 
with threenumber formulas indicating the balance between these 
elements the first number represents nitrogen which encourages 
growth of plant tissue to boost nitrogen content condition the 
soil with a mixture of organic material that includes aged manure 
phosphorous the second number stimulates cell development 
fruiting and disease resistance to add phosphorus rake bone meal 
into the soil potassium the third number helps plants form 
starches and sugars and helps them resist disease and drought wood 
ashes are a good source of potassium 
fertilizer thats marked 51010 or 101010 is most suitable 
assuming your soil has had sulfur or lime added and is close to 
neutral 
put mulch a thick layer of organic material around 
developing plants to help cut down the amount of water and weeding 
needed straw ground garden refuse bark and canadian peat make 
good mulches 
boost your soil with compost which is decomposed organic 
matter such as vegetable peelings lawn and garden debris and 
coffee grounds mixed with canadian peat they make excellent 
nutrients

trees and shrubs especially those whose roots may have been 
damaged in droughts of recent years need deep watering often for 
several hours 
symptoms of root damage include dieback and early leaf fall 
it may take about 15 gallons of water to penetrate soil a foot 
deep for an average tree depending on the type of soil how damp 
it already is and the water pressure used 
one way to be sure water penetrates to the roots is with a root 
feeder a sharp hollow spike about 30 inches long 
a nutrition cartridge to be dissolved in the water can be fed 
through the spike continue soaking until the soil is sufficiently 
saturated to help the plant food solution spread through the 
subsurface soil clay soils absorb more water and retain it longer 
below the surface sandy soils take less water but need it more 
often 
perforations made in the soil by a root feeding device should 
extend beyond the tree canopy at depths of 8 to 12 inches the 
performations also allow better penetration of rain water and 
provide air especially in compacted soils 
one root feeder is available from ross daniels of west des 
moines iowa

heather celebrated in literature captured in scents and 
emulated in colors also is being used by some gardeners for 
yearround pleasure 
writing in a recent issue of fine gardening magazine joyce 
descloux describes her garden of various heathers also called 
calluna in spring the tips of the young shoots are brightly 
colored others have green foliage that stays bright in winter 
but most turn plum purple or almost black during cold weather 
there are varieties with foliage that stays gold all year and 
others with gold foliage in summer that changes to shades of vivid 
orange crimson or dark red for the winter months 
closely associated with the moors of the british isles and 
western europe where these woody plants grow wild most heathers 
are easy to cultivate and maintain according to ms descloux who 
edits heather news journal of the north american heather society 
because it has naturally adapted to nutrientpoor soils heather 
doesnt need fertilizer it forms cooperative relationships with 
soil fungi which break down nutrients in acid soil for the host 
plant in exchange for carbohydrates manufactured by the plant 
heather grows best in soil much leaner than youd provide for 
most other flowering perennials says ms descloux 
some varieties grow to three feet others grow only half that 
height and spread horizontally often trailing down rocks and 
slopes most plants thrive well in cool moist climates with 
temperatures between 40 and 80 degrees but ms descloux says they 
can endure more extreme conditions if they are properly sited and 
cared for 
their foliage begins to assume winter color with the first 
autumn chill the colder it gets the more intense the colors 
become she writes

nut trees are not difficult to grow and they make ideal 
dualpurpose additions to your garden they are attractive and 
shady and in time they will provide a bonus of nuts 
nut trees need no more care than a common maple or oak and they 
are longlived most are deeprooting and thus little affected by 
vagaries of seasons and pests 
spring is the best time for planting in most areas though you 
can prepare the site in the fall start by digging a hole three 
feet in diameter and two feet deep fill it with good top soil 
which has been mixed with peat moss or other humus and some cow 
manure if the soil is poor add a generous amount of good 
vegetable fertilizer 
youll have a good choice of trees to plant but check your 
county agricultural extension service for advice on the best for 
your region 
possibilities include the thomas black walnut which is hardy 
bears when young and produces large easytocrack nuts the 
carpathian an english walnut is hardy fast growing and is good 
for shade its recommended you plant two for pollination 
if almonds are suitable to your area you might try halls 
these trees are small growing to about 15 feet wide and tall they 
can be grown in any area where peach trees thrive other small 
varieties include filberts and hazelnuts which grow to about 12 or 
15 feet 
pecan trees will grow much larger an old variety is stuart 
which can reach 40 to 50 feet bearing thinshelled fruit

home gardeners may be getting short shrift from seed producers 
with low and uneven yields resulting from individual packets 
writes steve solomon in the januaryfebruary issue of harrowsmith 
a garden and farm magazine 
some major seed growers consider small retailers and home 
gardeners as an uncritical trade according to solomon an 
author and mailorder seed merchandiser gardeners are such 
pushovers as customers that the trade has a saying the gardener 
gets the sweepings off the seedroom floor 
most seeds are produced by what solomon terms primary growers 
usually big corporations that are almost unknown to the gardening 
public they sell to the seed merchandisers who in turn package 
and market the seeds to the public 
solomon says that commercial farmers who account for the 
largest part of the primary growers profits have the most clout 
and get the cream of the seed crops 
many seed catalog firms offer welltested quality seeds that 
have been grown under controlled conditions but many others do 
not and because ungerminated seeds look alike the individual 
consumer takes his chances solomon says consumer protection laws 
set standards too low seeds so weak that they will barely come 
up in the field despite the best possible sprouting conditions 
can still be above the minimum standard germination he writes 
he advises gardeners to avoid bargains and pay top price for 
seeds the cost of seed is small compared with the value it can 
create and it takes the same amount of fertilizer water tillage 
and work to grow vegetables using bad seed as it does using good 
he also recommends buying from companies who operate trial gardens 
in a climate similar to your own

the space age tomato is nearly here 
about 125 million tomato seeds that orbited earth for six years 
in nasas ldef for long duration exposure facility satellite are 
being put into the hands of millions of students who will carry 
out experiments to find out what effect space exposure has on 
spaceexposed seeds 
there is no precedent to predict how the seed has been 
affected on the ldef satellite says dr jim alston research 
director for park seed company which is cooperating with nasa and 
langley research center in the experiment alston thinks the seeds 
on the satellite deployed by the shuttle orbiter challenger in 
l984 and retrieved by the space shuttle columbia in december will 
remain viable 
an estimated 4 million students and 40000 educators around the 
world will carry out experiments under a program called seeds 
space exposed experiment developed for students complexity will 
depend on grade level students in elementary classes for example 
will grow and compare the flight seed with the earthbased seed 
while secondarylevel students will work with lights and 
hydroponics university students will look at genetics and plant 
breeding nasa will publish a summary of the findings 
alston selected tomatoes because the vegetable is widely grown 
and recognized and because he estimated the density of the seeds 
would be right for the number required for the experiment he 
picked the rutgers an openpollinated variety because it breeds 
true which means the offspring are just like the parents through 
successive generations mutations from radiation exposure would be 
easier for students to identify and isolate in this strain 
educators who want their classes to participate in the 
experiment should request kits stating class level from nasa

by butterflies and butterflies in turn pollinate flower plants 
because natural hibernating sites for butterflies such as native 
woods are diminishing due to development threatening butterfly 
populations some gardeners are installing butterfly hibernation 
boxes to simulate the natural crevices in which the creatures 
hibernate these boxes are set up in the shade near trees

allergy sufferers who have problems with pollen outdoors can 
enjoy plants indoors as long as they dont overdo it says a 
university of oklahoma clinical professor of medicine 
plant lovers can have their cake and eat it too when it 
comes to having a green thumb indoors says to dr john bozalis of 
the universitys health sciences center 
plants can be a problem if a person is especially sensitive to 
mold spores we arent too concerned about indoor plants because 
most of them dont pollinate and cause problems he says 
the exception to that are flowers in the ragweed family such 
as chrysanthemums some people can have bad reactions to them keep 
in mind that people can have nonallergic irritant reactions to 
some odors of flowers such as honeysuckle 
bozalis a partner in the oklahoma allergy clinic says there is 
some concern about those who have many plants in their homes 
plants need water and the moist soil grows mold the spores 
of which are picked up and spread through the house causing 
allergic reactions he explains 
six or eight plants are usually all right for allergy sufferers 
bozalis says mold levels wont be high enough to cause trouble 
unless there is a hidden problem such as a leaky pipe in a wall 
allergic reactions to plants are usually seasonal and can be 
attributed to tree or grass pollination he notes 
bozalis says one clue to indoor allergic reactions is whether 
someone has problems yearround 
these can be caused by animals house dust or mold he says 
theres nothing better to determine the cause of an allergic 
reaction than for a patient to just sit down with a physician and 
do a thorough personal history

a chain saw is useful for cleanup and maintenance of your yard 
and garden but observe some basics for safe and easy operation 
solo incorporated which makes chain saws has these tips 
when starting the chain saw place it on level ground at least 
10 feet from the gas can and fueling area hold the saw down by 
placing one foot on the rear handlebar while firmly holding the 
front handlebar with one hand if your saw has only a top 
handlebar hold it firmly on the ground pulling up on the starting 
grip 
hold the saw firmly with both hands maintaining a secure 
grip this will help you avoid injury from kickback dont 
overreach or cut above shoulder height and when cutting logs only 
cut one at a time 
in bucking timber dont stand directly behind the saw while 
cutting position yourself so youll be away from the direction of 
the log roll hold the saw on the right side of your body outside 
the line of sight across the chain to minimize chances of injury 
from an unexpected broken chain or kickback examine the log for 
internal stress a bowed appearance is an indication and avoid 
cutting the log on the wrong side which can result in kickback 
to avoid kickback while limbing make sure the log is in a 
secure position and work on the safest side usually uphill and 
away from the fall of cut limbs to avoid kickback make sure the 
guidebars tip doesnt come in contact with another branch the 
side of a tree or another object when limbing bend your knees 
slightly and position your right leg behind the front carrying 
handlebar the left leg should be forward and away from the 
guidebars contact range avoid standing on limbs slash or debris 
survey the area before felling a tree is the trunk sound or 
hollow and rotted whats the wind direction and speed which 
direction is the tree leaning in is the trees crown denser and 
heavier on one side when youve determined the answers to these 
questions figure your escape route which should be at a 45degee 
angle back from the line of the fall when you have checked this 
and cleared the small limbs and branches from the bottom portion of 
the trunk youre ready to fell the tree stand away from the tree 
and maintain a balanced stance then start by making a careful 
undercut this notch cut to a depth of a quarterinch will 
determine the line of the fall and should be positioned at a right 
angle to the projected fall 
wear protective clothing each time you use a saw these 
include goggles or a face mask snug but comfortable work clothing 
cuffless long pants hearing protection nonslip safety gloves 
and boots with steel toecaps

you can make potted plants reflower outdoors but not very well 
inside with patience plants like tulips hyacinths narcissus and 
crocus are forced to bloom out of season in controlled conditions 
at the greenhouse so to bloom again they need a rest period and 
natural outdoor environments to reflower first remove the faded

too much fertilizer on house plants is worse than too little it 
can burn the roots of troubled plants fertilizer salts can build 
up and form crusty white residues which can harm plants be sure 
to follow dosages recommended on fertilizer packages slowgrowing 
plants need less than fastgrowing ones and all types will grow 
faster in spring and summer when they get more light from longer 
days if salts accumulate leach them out of the soil by watering

how often should you water your plants as often as they need 
it most houseplants need water when soil feels dry to the touch 
you also can judge by the weight of the pot a light pot means the 
soil is dry or insert a probe if soil clings to it when you pull 
it out that means the bottom soil is moist you also can tap the 
plant a hollow sound means dry soil when watering do it 
thoroughly but be sure to allow for drainage and empty the saucers 
of excess water avoid overwatering as it damages roots and causes 
yellowing and loss of lower leaves check with the florist or 
garden center where you bought the plant for recommended watering

the site where joseph campbell spawned a 
food products revolution has stopped canning soup for the first 
time in 121 years 
in two weeks production will grind to a halt at campbell soup 
cos oldest manufacturing plant marking another significant step 
in the companys march toward modernity 
for this economically strapped city across the delaware river 
from philadelphia the closing of a plant that employs 1000 
workers ushers in an uneasy time in its crucial revitalization 
efforts there are concerns that campbell might abandon plans for a 
new headquarters building here as well as doubts about the 
companys ability to remain independent 
to campbells officials the plants end was long overdue 
its like any other industry if youre doing anything like 
you were 50 years ago youre out of date said company spokesman 
james moran its just a plant whose time who has come no amount 
of money would make it competitive 
workers at the plant still load ingredients onto an elevator and 
transport them to different floors renovation would have cost 
millions but still would not have brought the facility up to par 
with campbells modern onefloor production plants elsewhere 
officials said 
the closing is part of a worldwide restructuring campbell 
announced last august that will eliminate 2800 jobs as well as 
plants in maryland and tennessee the reorganization is expected to 
save the company about 15 million during fiscal 1990 and about 
150 million over the next four years 
negotiations on severance agreements are continuing in camden 
production from the plant will be taken up by plants in napoleon 
ohio paris texas and maxton nc 
many of the bluecollar employees at the downtown plant have 
worked there most of their lives 
most of these people assumed they would be here for a while 
said alvin still president of local 80 of the united food and 
commercial workers which represents about 640 of the hourly 
employees in the plant 
still who has worked at the plant for more than 40 years said 
an estimated 230 employees will qualify for a pension plan the 
future is uncertain for the others he said 
we dont want to leave this company with our heads between our 
legs still said we want to walk straight with dignity 
there will be no fanfare when the last can rolls off the 
production line at the site where icebox maker abram anderson and 
fruit merchant joseph campbell began canning vegetables jellies 
and mincemeat in 1869 
the original building was replaced by a brick facility in 1896 
and the first condensed soups began production the following year 
the symbolism is already over said moran the plant is 
winding down 
during its heyday the eightstory plant produced 10 million 
cans of red and white labeled soup varieties daily in the 1930s 
recent output has averaged about 1 million cans a day of prego 
spaghetti sauce francoamerican pasta and beans 
campbell has been a mainstay in this economically depressed city 
of 85000 with its four huge soup cans prominent on the skyline 
campbell officials maintain the headquarters will remain here 
plans are underway to begin construction this year on a 35 
million 200000foot international headquarters on the citys 
waterfront 
nevertheless david johnson who became the first outsider to 
head the company when he took over as president in january met 
last week with gov jim florio and said plans for the new 
headquarters remain under review 
the possibility that campbell will back out concerns lawmakers 
the headquarters is considered vital to a 500 million waterfront 
project that includes a 42 million state aquarium 
you would lose that symbolic stability that a company like 
campbell brings said mayor aaron a thompson it will be a 
slowdown for the redevelopment 
johnson was hired to help change campbells image as an industry 
laggard slow to update facilities and products the companys 
dominance in the retail soup market has dropped in recent years and 
campbell has had trouble in the fastgrowing dry soup market 
for years john t dorrance jr the son of the 
chemistturnedentrepreneur who invented condensed soup in 1897 
was reluctant to close plants or lay off workers 
since his death last april the company has undergone massive 
changes including a split in the founders family that has fueled 
speculation that about a possible sale of the company 
three grandchildren of john t dorrance sr who own 174 
percent of campbell stock have announced they want to sell three 
other grandchildren who own 313 percent say they want to keep 
their shares and maintain the companys independence 
campbells fiscal 1989 earnings totaled 13 million or 10 cents 
a share down sharply from a profit of 2741 million or 212 a 
share the previous year the august restructuring reduced profits 
by 343 million

the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged today 
as relief over the governing partys election victory gave way to 
concern over higher interest rates and the dollar edged down 
against the japanese yen 
the dollar closed at 14452 yen down 003 yen from fridays 
14455yen finish it opened at 14428 yen and ranged between 
14410 yen and 14458 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average fell 23772 points or 063 
percent closing at 3722260 
the index which lost 1167 points friday climbed almost 150 
points in early trading today as results from sundays election 
showed the probusiness liberal democratic party retaining a 
comfortable margin in parliaments lower house 
the election results did reassure market players and prompted 
buying but it lasted only temporarily said yoshio shimoyama a 
senior dealer at nikko securities co 
as soon as investors felt relieved their concern quickly 
shifted to the possibility of yet another discount rate hike he 
said and the index headed downward 
in addition the governing partys victory had been anticipated 
in the market since last week said yuji kawakami an analyst 
with nomura securities co 
some people say the rate hike may come very soon and others 
say it will come sometime in spring he said adding that market 
players are gradually getting ready 
the official discount rate the interest charged by the bank of 
japan on loans to commercial banks now stands at 425 percent 
after three increases last year higher interest rates tend to 
discourage stock purchases 
shimoyama added that declines in japanese government bond prices 
and futures stock prices accelerated the nikkeis fall 
in currency dealings traders said the governing partys 
election victory did not strengthen the yen against other 
currencies today 
it was because market players bought back the dollar to make 
up their shortcover or oversold positions from last friday 
said koichi amaya a trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
investors had bought the japanese currency based on optimistic 
predictions for the ldps victory he said 
amaya said the discount rate rumor did not help support the yen 
the market doesnt have enough energy to buy more yen and push 
it higher he said

the widespread adoption of existing 
energysaving technology could cut us energy use by 75 percent 
solving the globalwarming problem profitably a researcher says 
improvements in energyefficient devices have come along so 
quickly that they now create astonishing potential savings 
said amory lovins director of research at the rocky mountain 
institute in snowmass colo 
he said his studies show the proper use of energy efficiency can 
outpace the current growth in the worlds population which stands 
at 53 billion 
a world of 8 billion people with a standard of living equal to 
that of west germany and an economy five times the current size 
could survive on onethird the energy that is being consumed 
worldwide now lovins said 
lovins said his extensive calculations show proven energysaving 
technology can save 80 percent of the oil the united states burns 
each year and can cut us electricity use by 75 percent 
the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil has left 
elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and enhanced 
the atmospheres ability to trap the suns heat a process called 
the greenhouse effect 
scientists generally agree that this process will noticeably 
raise average global temperatures perhaps in the next few decades 
producing environmental disruption and unpredictable weather 
changes 
most experts have assumed the shift away from fossil fuels to 
prevent global warming will be costly and difficult but lovins 
argued otherwise 
far from being costly abating global warming should on the 
whole be immensely profitable he wrote in a study he described 
sunday at the annual meeting of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
improving energy productivity can save the world upwards of a 
trillion dollars per year as much as the global military 
budget he wrote 
the utility industry and others say lovins has exaggerated the 
savings from improved energy efficiency 
onefourth of the electricity savings would come from 
improvements in lighting onefourth from improvements in motors 
and another quarter from energyefficient appliances and other 
equipment lovins said 
in the case of lighting the replacement of existing equipment 
with new reflectors lenses lamps controls and maintenance 
methods would create as much light as is provided now but with 
just 8 percent of todays electrical use lovins said 
lovins long has championed greater energy efficiency and 
published in 1977 a widely quoted book called soft energy paths

a chinese company ordered by president bush to 
sell a seattle aircraft parts company protested the decision 
monday saying it would jeopardize sinous relationships in the 
aviation industry 
the stateowned china national aerotechnology import and export 
corp or catic said the divestiture order will undoubtedly 
cause negative impact on future cooperation between the aviation 
industries of the two countries 
citing national security considerations bush ordered catic on 
feb 2 to sell mamco manufacturing co he acted on the 
recommendation of an interagency panel that found the seattle 
company was involved in sensitive materials that could have 
military applications 
bush said his action was based on one particular transaction and 
that his administration continues to welcome direct investment from 
china and other countries 
however the move was seen as an effort by bush to mute 
criticism from congress that he has been too quick to restore ties 
with the beijing government following its harsh suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement last spring 
it was the first time bush invoked a provision of a 1988 trade 
law giving the president power to restrict foreign investment if 
us security is at risk 
catic in a statement issued by the official xinhua news agency 
said its 1988 purchase of mamco was solely a commercial activity 
in the area of civilian aircraft manufacture and complied with 
federal and local laws in the united states 
it said mamco makes ordinary precision machinery for general 
manufacturing purposes and the acquisition does not involve any 
high technology leakage nor does it impair or threaten the 
national security of the united states 
catic was given three months to sell all its holdings in the 
company but may be granted a threemonth extension

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
increased for the first time this year when it jumped by 19 rigs 
this week to a total 918 officials said 
baker hughes inc reported monday the number of working rigs 
remained well above the figures from a year ago when the nations 
rig count was posted at 766 
last week the rig count dropped by 32 to 899 following several 
weeks of decline from the beginning of the year until this week 
the country had lost 167 working rigs 
experts had blamed the drop on a general seasonal decline 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
ike kerridge a baker hughes vice president and economist has 
said the rig count generally declines during the first quarter and 
is expected to bottom out in march or april he could not be 
reached for comment monday because of the holiday 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states texas flopped from having the 
greatest drop last week with seven to having the greatest gain with 
16 this week other states reporting gains include louisiana with 
10 pennsylvania with five ohio with three north dakota with two 
and colorado with a gain of one 
among states posting losses for the week wyoming showed the 
greatest drop with a loss of 14 while michigan lost four and new 
mexico was down two

the distinctive green bottles of perrier sparkling water that 
once adorned every table at the palm a tony restaurant in 
washington dc have been replaced by complimentary bottles of 
poland spring water 
in nashville tenn the manager at the french restaurant 
julians is using last weeks worldwide recall of perrier as a 
chance to introduce la croix a sparkling water from california to 
his customers 
the recall of perrier has reduced the choices of bottled waters 
at the four seasons in new york from three to two the sparkling 
water san pelligrino from italy and the noncarbonated evian from 
france but restaurant manager julian niccolini said there were no 
protests 
restaurant owners across the country report few problems in 
finding replacements for perrier the bestselling imported water 
brand in the united states 
that could be bad news for source perrier sa which recalled its 
flagship brand from stores and restaurants worldwide last week 
after discovering traces of benzene a potentially toxic chemical 
in some of its bottles 
perrier became a symbol of trendy sophistication in the 1980s 
and also benefitted from a move toward heightened health concerns 
like several other restaurant managers ray jacomo of the palm 
in washington said he will see what happens before putting perrier 
back on his tables when production resumes but expects to carry 
the brand again 
it still has the best name its like marlboro in cigarettes 
or hershey in chocolate bars he said 
but can perrier still lay claim to a selfstyled image of 
pristine purity and even if the company shows the drink being 
bottled is pure have its conflicting accounts of what caused the 
contamination scarred the brands reputation irreparably 
when source perrier sa ordered a recall of its bottles in the 
united states about 10 days ago a company official was quoted as 
saying an employee mistakenly used a product containing benzene 
the toxic chemical found in tiny amounts in some bottles to clean 
grease from a bottling line 
but when it recalled its water from distribution worldwide last 
wednesday perrier said small amounts of benzene gas passed through 
a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles at its natural spring 
in southern france it said workers had failed to change a pipe 
filter that would have caught the gas 
beverage analysts were divided on whether perrier can fully 
recover 
there is no way of predicting really said hellen berry 
market research director for beverage marketing corp a new 
yorkbased consulting firm the longer they are off the market 
the more difficult it will be 
jane lazgin a spokeswoman for perrier group of america inc 
perriers us subsidiary in greenwich conn said it will take 
two to three months for perrier to be back in restaurants and 
grocery shelves here 
jesse meyers publisher of the trade newsletter beverage digest 
in greenwich conn said he thinks people will respect source 
perrier for ordering the recall i think the company can come 
back stronger than ever before he said 
but tom pirko president of the consulting company bevmark inc 
in los angeles said he doubts the perrier brand will regain its 
prominence 
he said in a subliminal sense the public is now aware that the 
water was contamainated where it was bottled and will likely 
wonder maybe the filter works and maybe it doesnt 
i think perrier has seen its day pirko said 
according to bevmark the perrier brand captured 57 percent of 
the bottled water market estimated at 22 billion in wholesale 
sales in 1988 perrier was the thirdbest selling bottled water 
here behind arrowhead also from perrier at 77 percent and 
sparkletts from mckesson corp at 59 percent poland spring 
another perrier product was fourth at 35 percent 
perrier was the clear leader among the imports which accounted 
for 98 percent of the total market bevmark said 
at julians in nashville manager peter marti suspects people 
are going to be scared to drink perrier for a while when it gets 
back on the market 
he said he wants to see how la croix sells before deciding what 
to do when perrier gets back on the market maybe i would carry 
them both to give them a choice marti said 
niccolini of the four seasons said its going to take them a 
lot of advertising and a lot of promotion to be able to get back as 
strong as they were once production resumes 
but he added when they come back well take them back

the days when an argentine family 
could feast on filet mignon for less than what hamburger costs in 
most other countries may be nearing an end 
like most everything else in an economy wracked by 
hyperinflation and recession beef has come to be priced in us 
dollars rather than argentinas debased currency the austral for 
many argentines beef already is out of reach 
we argentines will have to get used to meat as something 
that is almost a luxury agriculture secretary felipe sola said 
monday 
for more than a century beef has been to argentina what oil is 
to saudi arabia a major export a source of prosperity a national 
symbol 
herds were so plentiful that travelers on the pampas the 
fertile plains surrounding buenos aires could shoot a cow for 
dinner sometimes eating just the tongue according to legend 
provided they left the hide which would be sold for leather 
cows still outnumber argentinas 31 million citizens by almost 
21 and a top steak in a good restaurant can be had for 250 or 
about what a 22 pounds of filet mignon costs in a butcher shop 
thats still cheap in international terms but as a proportion 
of salaries that have shrunk to 50 to 250 a month it is 
increasingly expensive 
beef consumption has fallen as inflation rocketed to 8164 
percent during the past 12 months nevertheless argentina will 
consume more beef and veal this year than any other nation 139 
pounds per person according to projections by the us agriculture 
departments foreign agricultural service 
but already lifestyle changes are apparent 
this nation that loves to dine out does so less and less guests 
at weekend barbecues often bring their own meat to throw on the 
grill beef has been replaced by noodles and rice on the shopping 
lists of argentines suffering wage shrinkage or outright 
unemployment which stands at about 10 percent 
so far the government has refused to intervene in the meat 
market where prices rose 45 percent from friday to monday or 
slightly more than the austral which traded monday at 4200 to the 
dollar 
the austral rate a year ago was 171 
the jump in the cost of living this month is projected to be 
what it was in january 79 percent workers might expect pay raises 
in that neighborhood but meat almost certainly will have climbed 
faster propelled by ranchers who would rather sell abroad than at 
home
