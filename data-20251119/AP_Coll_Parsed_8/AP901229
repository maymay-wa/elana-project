china is supplying new military 
aid to cambodias communist khmer rouge guerrillas despite its 
claim to have halted shipments months ago western intelligence and 
other sources say 
the sources also say the cambodian government is receiving 
support from thousands of vietnamese soldiers disguised as 
cambodians vietnam says it has withdrawn all its troops but the 
rebels have long disputed that 
the reports emerged this week as peace talks were stalled 
between the cambodian government and the resistance fighting has 
intensified in western cambodia over the past month 
the khmer rouge are loading trucks and trucks of new chinese 
ammunition said one western intelligence official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity there is a recent increase in chinese 
supplies to the khmer rouge 
other sources at the thai border town of aranyaprathet and 
elsewhere along the cambodian frontier said this week that the 
chinese are preparing fresh deliveries of ammunition in 
anticipation of a government offensive 
china is the main backer of the khmer rouge and two other 
guerrilla groups fighting the government vietnam installed after 
invading cambodia in late 1978 the khmer rouge which was ousted 
from power by the invasion is the strongest guerrilla army 
china said it had stopped military assistance after the five 
permanent members of the un security council including china and 
the united states adopted a peace plan for cambodia in late 
august 
since the five member countries of the security council 
adopted the five documents on cambodia china has not provided any 
military assistance including weapons to the cambodian 
resistance chinas foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said 
last month 
the guerrillas have supported the un plan which calls for a 
truce followed by un involvement in the countrys administration 
and unsupervised elections but the vietnameseinstalled 
government has rejected key elements of the plan 
meanwhile government forces are preparing a major offensive in 
the approaching dry season western intelligence and guerrilla 
sources say 
they say the government is supported by vietnamese troops who 
have secretly returned to cambodia disguised as cambodian 
government soldiers 
vietnam says it withdrew all troops from cambodia in september 
1989 but western intelligence sources in bangkok say they believe 
there are 4000 to 9000 vietnamese military personnel in the 
country 
they say vietnam has supplied large amounts of ammunition to the 
government in recent months 
however one analyst predicted that if peace talks break up the 
khmer rouge is in a position to win the war 
if the phnom penh government chooses to fight it out with the 
khmer rouge they are making a big mistake said the intelligence 
analyst in bangkok 
khmer rouge support within the country is growing and they 
have the means to continue regardless of any international cutoff 
if this peace proposal fails it is out of the control of anyone 
but cambodians and in the long run it is the khmer rouge who will 
win 
during its rule from 197579 the khmer rouge killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians directly through purges and executions and 
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical 
agrarian relocation program

vice president dan quayle doesnt abide 
discrimination at golf clubs his office says but he still plays 
at one of the most exclusive allmale courses near the capital as 
an honorary member 
quayle on friday canceled a second round of golf at the 
allwhite cypress point golf club near monterey calif after he 
learned the facility was mired in a racial controversy said his 
press secretary david beckwith 
he had played there thursday unaware beckwith said that the 
club was ruled ineligible for its share of the 1991 atampt pebble 
beach national proam tournament next month because it has no black 
members 
quayle was unwilling to leave any impression that he condones 
any form of discrimination so he left california and returned to 
vail colo where he had been on a skiing vacation beckwith said 
but the spokesman said he could not explain why quayle is an 
honorary member of the burning tree club in suburban bethesda md 
which bars women from its course 
he encourages all clubs to adopt nondiscriminatory 
policies beckwith said 
he said quayle is not a duespaying member the clubs 
membership roster lists him as an honorary member 
burning trees members include some of the nations most 
powerful political leaders the 68yearold club last year lost a 
court battle to regain a tax break the maryland legislature had 
revoked in 1986 because of its refusal to admit women as members or 
generally allow them on the property 
quayles chief of staff bill kristol said in a telephone 
interview i dont think playing at burning tree is inconsistent 
with opposing discrimination lots of people with good 
antidiscriminatory records have played golf at burning tree 
cypress point does admit women but it refused to admit black 
members in time to conform to the professional golfers 
associations new guidelines that hold no host tournament club can 
discriminate against blacks or women 
we have no discrimination clauses in our bylaws but we do not 
have black members said club pro jim langley we have a 
waiting list of approved applicants of several years and we 
couldnt bypass them 
quayle went to cypress point at the invitation of his college 
roommate mark rolfing a media golf commentator according to 
local sources he teed off thursday with two cypress point club 
members who are administration officials air force secretary 
donald b rice and ebersole gaines the top us diplomat in 
bermuda 
beckwith said quayle was assured the club had no policy of 
discrimination but left friday because he did not want to leave any 
appearance of condoning discrimination 
asked how quayle could be unaware of the highly publicized 
banning of cypress point from the pga tournament kristol said 
it proves hes not spending time reading the golf pages 
the vice president leaves washington tonight on a new years 
visit to us troops in the persian gulf area

indonesia plans to try leaders of a 
littleknown insurgent movement next month and overseas human 
rights groups should monitor the trial one of the groups says 
about 40 defendants face charges in three cities for alleged 
activity in behalf of aceh merdeka or free aceh an armed 
liberation group operating at the northern tip of sumatra sidney 
jones executive director of asia watch said friday 
the cases could provide accounts of torture killings and other 
atrocities that have become routine in counterinsurgency campaigns 
in the aceh region and elsewhere in indonesia asia watch said 
in aceh there is no question that both sides have engaged in 
atrocities but the scale and brutality of the indonesian response 
is out of all proportion to the threat posed by the insurgents 
ms jones said 
the current outbreak of violence in the aceh region began 18 
months ago and the combined death toll on both sides has been 
estimated as high as 1000 asia watch said in a yearend report on 
the situation 
corpses continue to be found along roads and rivers in three 
districts of aceh it said the indonesian military appears to 
have systematically killed at least dozens and perhaps hundreds of 
suspected aceh merdeka supporters in revenge as a deterrent and as 
a means of disposing of prisoners 
human rights violations in the aceh region fall into a pattern 
of systematic and gross abuses already well established in 
indonesia the report said 
it cited similar abuses in past disturbances in east timor east 
irian and central java torture techniques reported from aceh 
occur throughout indonesia including in jakarta police stations 
torture reported from aceh and standard throughout indonesia is 
the placing of a chair or table over the suspects foot which the 
interrogator then sits on it said 
indonesia does not admit international human rights 
organizations for official observation but asia watch hopes to be 
represented unofficially at the open trials in the cities of medan 
banda aceh and lhokseumawe ms jones said by telephone from new 
york 
asia watch is affiliated with helsinki watch and other groups 
that promote observance of human rights set forth in the 1975 
helsinki eastwest agreement 
ms jones said she discussed human rights at a meeting with 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas at the united nations this 
fall and later visited sumatra privately 
she quoted alatas as telling her that asia watch could come to 
his country officially when it stops taunting indonesia she 
said she replied that international pressure is critical to bring 
about improvements in the human rights situation and what they 
call taunting we call constructive criticism

a request from the surinamese ambassador to delay action 
ambassador glenn a alvares had asked the council for the 
postponement until we have sufficient information of what 
happened in suriname to act in conformity with the realities 
but the venezuelan representative guido grooscors refused to 
accept a delay calling the coup an intolerable action against the 
will of the people of suriname 
the use of armed force to take decisions in the political 
field must be eradicated from this continent he said 
us representative luigi einaudi said 
we cannot be silent about the events in suriname that deprive 
the surinamese people of their rights we cannot allow those 
illegal acts to threaten the democracy now developing in latin 
america 
the united states condemns the violation of constitutional 
order in suriname and calls on the surinamese military to restore 
power immediately to the democratically elected authorities of that 
country

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan says millions of sick elderly or poor americans will 
suffer if proposed cuts in his budget are implemented 
the reductions would leave sullivans agency unable to maintain 
current services in programs like medicare and social security the 
secretary said in a letter to the white house protesting the office 
of management and budgets proposed cuts he said the result would 
be longer processing times for claims 
sullivans letter said also that the omb proposal would provide 
inadequate funds to turn more attention to prenatal care and 
expansion of programs to combat lead poisoning breast cancer 
tuberculosis and aids as the department wants to do 
the letter a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
on friday was sent last friday night to omb director richard 
darman first word of it appeared in fridays new york times 
a department budget official said that during the past week much 
progress had been made in negotiations with omb but he declined to 
give specifics the negotiations are continuing he said 
the letter said that cuts in funds for administration of the 
health care financing administration which handles medicare and 
medicaid and the social security administration could hurt our 
ability to respond to the needs of 50 million aged and disabled 
beneficiaries 
kevin moley hhs assistant secretary for management and budget 
said that while the figure of 50 million was correct when the 
letter was written a week ago it is far fewer today than last 
week and we expect to resolve those issues by the time we announce 
our budget 
moley declined to say how much money was in dispute and the 
letter did not spell out the total 
sullivans letter of appeal is part of the annual budgetmaking 
process after a department drafts a budget request omb reviews 
it makes changes and sends the resulting proposal called a pass 
back to the department the department then negotiates with omb 
and if still not satisfied may appeal to the president himself 
it is rare that any agency head is satisfied with ombs pass 
back 
president bush will give his budget proposal covering the 1992 
fiscal year beginning on oct 1 1991 to congress in early 
february 
ombs pass back to hhs would cut medicare by 27 billion in 
addition to the nearly 6 billion agreed to in the 
deficitreduction package approved by the administration and 
congress in october the extra cuts would come from payments to 
physicians and hospitals 
the proposed cuts in administrative expenses of social security 
would increase the backlog of telephone calls and mean more busy 
signals sullivans letter said 
sullivan said the department needs an additional 82 million 
beyond what omb would provide for efforts to get highrisk women 
into prenatal care these efforts would help reduce the united 
states high infant mortality rate and reduce costs for care of 
premature infants he said 
sullivan also wants 143 million beyond ombs proposal for 
programs that increase access to health care for minorities and the 
disadvantaged 
the secretary also told darman he wants to further decrease the 
low income home energy assistance program to 468 million which 
has been running at about 1 billion a year in recent years and 
target it to the northeast states where lowincome residents are 
most likely to use fuel oil to heat their homes

prime minister toshiki kaifus 10monthold cabinet 
resigned today after intense party pressure to allow other senior 
politicians to hold prestigious government posts a top official 
said 
kaifus new cabinet was to be announced this evening many key 
ministers are expected to retain their posts and no major policy 
changes were expected 
the makeup of the new cabinet has been the subject of intense 
debate within the governing liberal democratic party kaifu is 
strongly opposed to demands by some senior party leaders to bring 
back politicians who were tainted by an influencepeddling scandal 
last year 
whether kaifu can keep his cabinet free of politicians linked to 
the scandal in which the recruit jobplacement conglomerate 
offered lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians is 
being viewed by analysts as a test of his political clout 
there was no immediate official announcement of the cabinet 
reshuffle but politicians leaving an afternoon meeting with kaifu 
indicated the resignations had been tendered 
a top government official speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that all 21 cabinet members had handed letters of 
resignation to kaifu upon his request 
nothing is going to change except faces in the cabinet profile 
book said masaya ito a prominent political analyst who served 
as secretary to the late prime minister hayato ikeda 
japans cabinet is typically reshuffled annually to give 
desirable assignments to senior lawmakers of the liberal democratic 
party 
the party is comprised of five major factions each headed by a 
powerful politician who aspires to become prime minister and to win 
cabinet posts for his allies 
because he belongs to the smallest faction kaifu is regarded as 
having a weak power base and needs to compromise with other faction 
leaders 
kaifu originally had said he would not announce a change before 
the new year in an effort to display some independence but 
apparently changed his mind after meeting friday afternoon with 
ichiro ozawa the partys powerful secretary general

americans paid more attention to the persian 
gulf crisis than to any other news story in 1990 a year in which 
domestic news reports were dominated by international events a 
survey shows 
twothirds of the public closely followed stories about the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and the deployment of us forces in the 
region over the last five months according to the survey by the

communism in almost all of eastern europe and the economic and 
political turmoil in the soviet union the survey said that at no 
point did more than 30 percent of americans closely follow these 
events 
the mideast events also figured in the most closely followed 
domestic news story of the year sixtytwo percent of those 
surveyed said they regularly read stories about soaring gasoline 
prices in august and september 
by comparison reports in november about the declining economy

stories leaing up to and including the november general election 
caught the regular attention of only 38 percent as did stories 
last january about the war against drugs 
only one other news event also involving us soldiers fighting

americans sixty percent of americans regularly read stories about 
the us invasion of panama although us troops invaded panama in 
december 1989 their presence in the country and numerous news

year 
last spring only 18 percent of the public paid close attention

39 percent 
there was only scant attention to the nations budget deficit 
last spring when rep dan rostenkowski dill proposed a deficit

package 18 percent of the readers were following the issue closely 
with public attention increasing to 34 percent by the fall amid

widely during the year 
when bush attended the drug summit in columbia last february 
only 22 percent of the public paid close attention to news stories 
about the visit criticism of the president on his changing 
position on taxes and his persian gulf policy caught the close 
attention of slightly less than a third of the public 
by contrast three out of four people read last march about 
bushs distaste for broccoli 
sensational crimes and trials brought substantial public 
interest during 1990 
news about the serial killings in gainesville fla attracted 
more public attention 36 percent than any other crime story 
during the year twentyeight percent of the readers followed the 
drug arrest of mayor marion barry of washington dc but interest 
waned only 16 percent paid close attention to stories about 
barrys conviction on some of the charges 
some stories attracted less public interest than expected 
despite the extensive coverage of the nomination of david souter 
to the us supreme court only about 15 percent followed the event 
closely and more than half of the people surveyed said they 
strongly felt too much was written about the marital breakup of

from his wife 2 percent 
the 1990 survey reflects monthly telephone polls of about 1200 
adults nationwide each monthly survey has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percent

convicted of violating any drug law including possession of 
marijuana for personal use 
states that refuse could lose 5 percent of their federal highway 
aid in the 12 months starting oct 1 1993 that would be 60 
million at current levels of aid to california said the 
amendments sponsor rep gerald solomon rny the amendment 
passed in july 
new yorks penalty would be an estimated 16 million said state 
transporation department spokesman david ernst 
the penalty would become 10 percent two years later 
the penalty appears modest in light of californias 55 billion 
budget but with 1991s state deficit projected as high as 10 
billion any potential loss of revenue is a sensitive issue 
govelect pete wilson has not taken a position on driver 
license suspensions but press secretary bill livingstone said 
wilson agrees with outgoing federal drug overseer william bennett 
that californias drug laws are too lenient 
wilson cannot require the democraticcontrolled legislature to 
pass a license suspension law but his position could determine the 
fiscal impact on the state solomons amendment lets a state avoid 
a monetary penalty only if both the legislature and the governor 
oppose the requirement of license suspensions 
california liberalized its marijuana law in 1975 possession of 
an ounce or less which previously could be prosecuted as a felony 
with a state prison sentence is now subject to a 100 fine with 
no jail time or permanent criminal record 
the state requires a fourmonth license suspension for drunken 
drivers but doesnt suspend licenses for drinking drug use or drug 
possession unrelated to driving 
any action by the new york state legislature on the requirement 
probably wouldnt come for several years after the federal 
government issues details of how the highway program would be run 
were aware of the law were waiting for the regulations to 
see how to best proceed said christopher cernik counsel to 
assemblyman michael bragman chairman of the assembly 
transportation committee 
a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws gordon brownell called the mandatory license 
suspension tantamount to a recriminalization and a federally 
imposed interference with california public policy 
in california the chairmen of the legislative committees that 
would handle the license suspension bill both criticized the 
federal law but declined to predict the states response 
sen bill lockyer chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
said he generally favored minimal sentences for possessing small 
amounts of marijuana but was noncommittal on the license 
suspension proposal 
assemblyman john burton chairman of the assembly public safety 
committee said he opposed the license suspension as unwarranted 
federal interference as well as on its merits 
driving under the influence of a drug is one thing possessing 
it is another he said

rebels in rwanda say they have killed 
more than 70 government soldiers in recent clashes in the northern 
part of the central african country

rwandan patriotic front said its guerrillas inflicted the losses in 
six skirmishes against government forces in the week before 
christmas

referring to a recent government claim that it had killed 400 
rebels the statement said most of those slain by rwandan soldiers 
had been civilians 
independent casualty figures were unavailable

the regimes forces turn on innocent civilians the statement 
said

investigators looking for the counterfeiters of 
several famous brands of perfumes found a more common but no less 
distinctive trademark bogus jars of vicks vaporub 
sleuths hired to track down suppliers of phony yves saint 
laurent and giorgio scents discovered 10000 fake jars of the cold 
remedy in a raid on an illicit perfume laboratory 
the nov 22 raid was confirmed this week by brandt handley 
director of marketing for procter and gamble the cincinnatibased 
company that owns richardsonvicks inc 
the bogus vaporub jars with arabic words in addition to english 
on the label were intended for sale in the middle east handley 
said valid vaporub made in neighboring malaysia has only english 
and chinese lettering for the regional market 
the salve is sold in more than 100 countries and made in more 
than a dozen legitimate plants around the world from its 
birthplace in north carolina to factories in mexico india and 
australia 
handley said his companys trademark had been ripped off 
sporadically over the past 15 years the latest batch smelled more 
like chinese medicated oil than the distinctive mix of menthol 
camphor and eucalyptus oil 
responding to pressure from the united states singapore 
tightened its copyright laws in 1987 this was an attempt to end 
its reputation as one of the hubs of counterfeit goods ranging from 
computer software to clothing books watches perfumes and music 
and video recordings 
us officials complained that the copying often called piracy 
cost legitimate producers hundreds of millions of dollars a year in 
lost revenue 
five years ago pirated cassettes accounted for 90 percent of all 
tape sales in singapore tens of millions of illicit prerecorded 
cassettes were exported each year 
the 1984 band aid charity recording of do they know its 
christmas produced to aid famine victims in ethiopia was 
pirated in singapore two weeks after it was released in britain 
singapores role as the major world center for sham scents 
peaked in 198788 when 800000 bottles were exported annually said 
jeanlouis faure security director of yves saint laurent 
perfume pirates took advantage of the countrys excellent 
shipping facilities and dutyfree status to import components 
cheaply the bottles generally came from taiwan and essences could 
be ordered from specialist companies in france and switzerland 
they prospered because the equipment needed could be cheaply 
installed in an apartment and the penalties were relatively light 
after pursuing the pirates for years with limited success 
manufacturers hope that a recent series of raids mark a turning 
point 
private investigators mounted 17 raids in the last 14 months 
two of the last three major illicit perfumeries known to be 
operating were hit in november faure said they found the vaporub 
in one of those raids apparently a synthetic sideline

the texas house speaker was indicted on 
charges he accepted 5000 from a law firm and didnt disclose it 
joining legislative leaders in the two other most populous states 
under an ethical cloud 
house speakers in new york and california also are under 
scrutiny as they prepare for new legislative sessions the 
investigation in texas also involves other legislators 
a travis county grand jury returned indictments on two 
misdemeanor charges friday against gib lewis alleging he solicited 
and received a gift from the san antoniobased law firm of heard 
goggan blair amp williams then failed to report it 
despite the charges lewis lawyer said the lawmaker would seek 
an unprecedented fifth term as house speaker 
i dont see any legal reason or otherwise why he shouldnt be 
elected to the speakership attorney bill willms said 
the 150member house will elect a speaker jan 8 the first day 
of the regular legislative session 
the first charge alleges the law firm paid part of a tax bill 
lewis owed the second claims he failed to disclose the payment as 
a gift on his public financial disclosure statement 
the maximum penalty upon conviction of both charges is 1 years 
in jail and a 3000 fine 
although these crimes are misdemeanors they are among the 
most serious crimes a public official can be charged with 
prosecutor ronnie earle said friday 
lewis a fort worth democrat has denied any wrongdoing and his 
lawyers said he would plead innocent lawyer allen hill and other 
defense attorneyes said the charges were politically motivated 
lewis 54 was traveling and unavailable for comment on the 
indictment said his spokesman monte williams 
the grand jury which will remain in session for another three 
months also is investigating an april 1987 trip to mexico that 
lewis took with four partners in the law firm an austin lobbyist 
and six women one of whom reportedly was a topless dancer named 
chrissee 
there are a number of allegations remaining under 
investigation concerning mr lewis various members of the 
legislature and lobbyists earle said 
heard goggan one of the few law firms in texas with contracts 
to collect delinquent taxes for local governments paid about half 
of a 10433 delinquent tax bill owed by a company partly owned by 
lewis the indictment claims lewis has said the payment 
represented a business settlement 
as speaker for the last eight years lewis has controlled the 
house assigning bills to committees naming their chairmen and 
directing floor debate 
earle said the indictments were issued friday to meet the 
statute of limitations on misdemeanor charges and because of the 
upcoming election for house speaker 
in the past eight years the law firm has flourished under a 
state law that allows a private firm hired by local governments to 
add a 15 percent fee onto overdue tax bills 
numerous legislative attempts aimed at changing the law have 
died in house committees 
in new york assembly speaker mel miller pleaded innocent dec 
20 to federal mail fraud harges involving allegations of a real 
estate scam 
miller a democrat from new york city and top aide and former 
law partner jay adolf were indicted on 19 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy and falsifying documents 
the charges stem from millers private law practice and miller 
claims they amount to a political witch hunt 
california assembly speaker willie brown reportedly is being 
investigated about allegations that he was involved in legislation 
aimed at helping a regional garbage company get around local 
restrictions on landfills brown has not been charged with any 
crime and denies any impropriety

nancy cruzan is free at last her father 
said at a tearful funeral amid proud reflections on the young 
womans role in the national righttodie debate 
ms cruzans nearly eightyear journey to death resulted in a 
landmark us supreme court decision and a 500fold jump in 
inquiries about living wills joe cruzan told mourners friday 
living wills allow adults to specify in advance their wishes about 
lifesustaining treatment 
i believe that these facts speak to the legacy that nancy left 
us he told more than 200 mourners she did not die in vain 
ms cruzan 33 severely brain damaged in a 1983 car accident 
died wednesday at missouri rehabilitation center in mount vernon 
12 days after her feeding tube was removed 
she was buried in carterville cemetery just north of joplin 
mourners crowded under a broad green tent to view her blue metal 
casket which was etched with flying sea gulls and decorated with 
about two dozen bright floral arrangements 
the flowers included a single red rose from ms cruzans 
grandparents a red white and blue arrangement from her 1975 webb 
city high school graduating class and violets from the cheese plant 
where she worked 
before the burial 13 photographs of ms cruzan were displayed 
above the casket including one of her as an infant bundled for 
winter play as a little girl wrestling with a tootall bicycle and 
as a smiling young woman 
we all feel good that nancy is free at last joe cruzan told 
reporters it was time 
after most mourners left he returned for a moment alone and 
placed a pink flower on the grave 
ms cruzans parents waged a long legal battle for permission to 
remove the feeding tube contending their daughter would rather die 
than continue in a persistent vegetative state but their request 
was stymied because she left no written instructions about being 
kept alive 
in its first righttodie decision the supreme court ruled in 
june that missouri could require clear and convincing evidence 
to verify ms cruzans intentions 
a federal judge ruled that the family did provide such evidence 
and the feeding tube was removed ms cruzan died 12 days later 
demonstrators kept a death watch outside the hospital and made 
unsuccessful pleas to missouri and federal courts to reconnect the 
feeding tube there were no protests at the funeral or burial

while not dismissing the lawsuit us district judge manuel 
real said there was insufficient evidence presented to block the 
transaction

tony the tiger says frosted flakes are grrrreat but attorneys 
general from five states claim he isnt telling the full story 
the officials allege kellogg co used deceptive and misleading 
health claims about frosted flakes and two other cereals a company 
spokesman denied the accusations 
in documents filed friday in federal court in des moines iowa 
the attorneys general responded to kelloggs claims made in a 
lawsuit filed in august against the iowa attorney general and 
secretary of agriculture 
the lawsuit and counterclaims stem from an investigation into 
kelloggs advertising that began two years ago 
the officials from minnesota california florida texas and 
wisconsin also made several counterclaims among them that 
kelloggs lacks reasonable substantiation for claiming frosted 
flakes is a healthy snack food superior to some fruits television 
commercials for the cereal feature the cartoon character tony the 
tiger 
regarding special k the officials said kelloggs misrepresented 
the cereals benefit by saying those who eat it can keep the 
muscle lose the fat 
they said such representation failed to disclose that for the 
vast majority of consumers and even for those on a diet eating one 
serving of special k would have virtually no effect on preventing 
the loss of muscle as the majority of dieters are in no danger of 
losing muscle and for those who are a serving of special k would 
be insignificant 
kelloggs claim that a cereal formerly named 40plus bran flakes had 
a particular benefit because it contained the maximum amount of 
fiber plus iron for people over 40 failed to say the cereal was 
not formulated particularly for people over 40 the officials said 
in addition there was no proof that people over 40 needed the 
ingredients contained in the cereal more than younger people they 
said 
kellogg no longer markets its bran flake cereal under the 40plus 
name 
joseph stewart kelloggs senior vice president for corporate 
affairs said the company based in battle creek mich stands 
behind its advertising 
the federal authority over advertising exists and these 
individuals are attempting now to regulate advertisements 
statebystate he said 
kellogg has promoted special k as a high protein cereal for more 
than 35 years he said and claims the cereal can help retain 
muscle while losing fat when eaten as part of a regimen that 
includes exercise 
frosted flakes has 11 grams of sugar while an apple for 
example has 14 grams of sugar stewart said 
he said kellogg officials at first sought to negotiate with iowa 
officials but now contend the accusations amount to harassment

faced with a growing wave of violence and 
unrest somalia has appealed for public support for a crackdown on 
various armed gangs and rebels bent on overthrowing the government 
of president mohamed siad barre 
the appeal for public support by information minister umar 
muhammad abd alrahman came late friday after a government 
announcement of new clashes between security forces and armed gangs 
thursday 
the government said two gunmen were killed and more than 20 
arrested in the shootout in a shantytown on the northern outskirts 
of somalias capital mogadishu 
but unofficial reports reaching nairobi the capital of 
neighboring kenya spoke of many more deaths and hundreds of 
arrests by security forces in the somali capital 
in a broadcast monitored in nairobi somali national radio said 
alrahman appealed to the people of the country to collaborate with 
the security forces 
the minister appealed to the somali masses to show their 
allegiance by collaborating with the forces engaged in maintaining 
the countrys security and stability the radio said 
it was not clear whether security forces were battling lawless 
elements or rebels in mogadishu the government has long used the 
term bandits to describe armed rebels 
siad barres government has lost ground in recent months to 
separate rebel groups in the north center and south of the 
elbowshaped nation his grip on the capital also appears to be 
slipping 
the united somali congress the insurgency fighting in the 
center of the country is reported by western diplomats and others 
to be within 30 miles of the capital 
the somali national movement which began the uprising against 
barres rule two years ago occupies much of the northern part of 
the nation 
a smaller rebel group the somali patriotic movement has tied 
up government troops with scattered raids in the south 
the united states and most other western nations withdrew all 
but essential embassy personnel from mogadishu two weeks ago and 
urged their nationals to leave the horn of africa country

hundreds of american indians gathered 
in frigid weather to commemorate todays centennial of one of the 
saddest days in their history the wounded knee massacre 
the indians traveling by foot and horseback arrived friday at 
the site where hundreds of sioux including chief big foot were 
slain by us cavalry soldiers on dec 29 1890 in the last major 
engagement between american indians and us troops 
tribal leaders gov george mickelson and hawaii sen daniel 
inouye who chairs the senate select committee on indian affairs 
were among those scheduled to participate in commemorative 
ceremonies 
the band of riders left two weeks ago on a 220mile journey 
retracing the path taken by big foot and his fellow sioux as they 
headed toward the pine ridge indian reservation in southwest south 
dakota 
one hundred years ago this was the last day big foot was 
free said alex white plume who helped coordinate the ride 
they didnt know they were going to bloodshed but today we know 
what happened 
also riding with the group was former american indian movement 
leader russell means who helped lead an armed takeover of wounded 
knee in 1973 to protest treatment of indians he said his return to 
the area he and other protesters held for 71 days filled him with 
pride 
wounded knee proved to indian people that its all right to 
stand up and be an indian and that its even worth fighting for 
he said 
two people were killed and several wounded in the takeover 
which divided the sioux nation indictments against means and 115 
others eventually were dismissed 
after sioux leader sitting bull was killed big foot led a band 
of sioux in december 1890 from central south dakota toward the pine 
ridge reservation 
accounts vary as to who fired first at wounded knee but scores 
of sioux men women and children were killed federal officials put 
the figure at about 150 while sioux officials say as many as 400 
died

the soviet union is deliberating its political 
ties to cuba and preparing to drastically cut aid next month while 
its longtime ally in the caribbean is bracing for the worst 
cuban president fidel castro on friday spoke of impending 
dismissals of communist party officials during a parliamentary 
session on ways to restructure the island nations political and 
economic system the havanabased official news agency prensa 
latina reported 
castro expressed that the central committee had reached 
excessive levels of personnel said an agency dispatch monitored 
in mexico city 
it said the party personnel must be transferred to farm work and 
construction to meet cubas needs in the face of economic crisis 
soviet economic aid to cuba hovers at 5 billion a year and 
military aid is near the 15 billion mark according to western 
estimates but economic hard times in the soviet union are expected 
to mean an aid reduction decision during january trade talks 
the kremlin maintains it will stand by castro politically but 
castros unflagging rejection of sovietstyle reform may influence 
the national supreme soviet legislature when it comes to debating a 
foreign aid bill 
if they cubans continue the socalled old course well 
let them continue but foreign aid wont be as it was before 
said nikolai v neyland a member of the supreme soviets foreign 
affairs committee 
prensa latina quoted castro as saying that twothirds of the 
cuban communist partys officials were recently cut from the ranks 
and reported that parliament president juan escalona invited 
lawmakers suggestions on how to trim away moreof them 
the goal is to propose to the cuban communist partys 4th 
congress how municipal governments should be structured and how 
many people can function efficiently escalona said 
the scheduling of the congress expected to result in 
constitutional reform sometime in the first half of 1991 is seen 
as an indication that cuba needs to adjust its political 
trajectory 
castro has given a cold shoulder to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs political reforms undertaken in 1985 
in turn gorbachevs new thinking on foreign affairs led him 
to state during a 1989 visit to cuba that he opposes castros 
support for communist revolutions in countries such as el salvador 
angola and nicaragua 
the soviets are also promoting a thaw in uscuban relations a 
31year antagonism that nearly led to nuclear war over the 1962 
cuban missile crisis 
however the official reason for cutting soviet aid to cuba is 
financial 
gorbachevs foreign aid bill proposes a 75 percent cut in 
gratuitous foreign economic aid apparently for all soviet 
allies 
it envisions a new policy starting jan 1 requiring allies to 
pay convertible currency at world prices for most trade with the 
soviet union 
that would mean the end of favorable trade terms to cuba as well 
as vietnam north korea ethiopia and other countries 
meanwhile more than 100000 supporters of the communist youth 
guild held a rally in havana friday in support of castro prensa 
latina said castros cuban revolution marks its 32nd anniversary 
on tuesday

a dentist gave a false name and 
occupation to doctors treating him for aids contends a lawyer for 
a woman who says she contracted the deadly disease from him during 
dental surgery 
attorney david eaton who represents 22yearold kimberly 
bergalis made the allegation friday during a hearing in her suit 
against cigna dental health of florida inc 
the insurer put the late dr david acer on its list of preferred 
dentists to be used by the companys clients bergalis claims acer 
transmitted the disease to her during a september 1987 visit in 
which he removed two of her wisdom teeth 
one defense being raised is that acer was told he could 
continue treating patients eaton said 
but eaton said acer who died sept 1 didnt even tell the 
doctors treating him his real name 
he said he was david johnson a real estate developer so 
theres no way a doctor could have told him it was ok to continue 
treating patients eaton said 
the dentist died two days after he wrote a letter to former 
patients urging them to be tested for aids but expressing doubts 
they could have caught the disease from him 
i consulted medical experts on whether i should continue 
practicing dentistry acer said in the letter the experts 
advised me that as long as i followed the guidelines promulgated by 
the center for disease control that i could safely continue to 
practice as a dentist and that i would not infect my patients 
continental national america insurance co carried acers 1 
million dental malpractice policy which is the only asset of 
acers estate 
attorneys for both sides were in st lucie county circuit court 
on friday for a hearing on whether bergalis attorneys are entitled 
to examine acers medical records from the veterans administration 
hospital in miami 
attorney dennis vandenberg representing cna said acers 
parents dont want their sons family history and names of social 
contacts turned over to eaton 
circuit judge robert makemson gave the va until jan 11 to turn 
over all medical records including acers family and social 
history

a leader of a tourism boycott says the sending of a 
2yearold proclamation to nelson mandela fails to make up for what 
protesters see as a snub of the south african antiapartheid 
leader 
metrodade mayor steve clark sent a proclamation designating 
june 26 1988 nelson mandela day clark uncovered the littleknown 
proclamation last weekend 
organizers of the 5monthold tourism boycott want metrodade 
miami beach and miami to each award mandela a proclamation and keys 
to the city honors denied him during his visit last june 
since your visit to miami beach last june clark wrote 
mandela on thursday controversy and misunderstanding have 
developed over the lack of recognition given you by our local 
officials 
the 2yearold proclamation shows that the fight which you 
have waged for almost a quarter of a century in opposing the 
policies of apartheid in south africa long has been recognized by 
myself and the people of metropolitan dade county he said 
boycott organizer ht smith said the action doesnt go far 
enough the wrong occurred in 1990 and anything that happened 
before that does not redress the wrong done in 1990 smith said 
because your boss gave you a raise in 1988 dos not at all make 
up for him unfairly snubbing you in 1990

reporter dwayne bray to reveal the contents of notes he took during 
an interview with joyce anaga

said her husband had abused her and that she shot him while they 
were struggling over a shotgun she said she planned to plead 
selfdefense under a new ohio law for battered women she goes on 
trial next week before macmillan 
prosecutors said they want to see all of mrs anagas comments

yugoslavias foreign minister today 
launched a new mediation effort in the persian gulf crisis on 
behalf of the 102nation nonaligned movement 
the move by yugoslav foreign minister budimir loncar who 
arrived in baghdad friday night came 17 days away from the un 
deadline for iraq to get out of kuwait or risk attack by the 
growing usled multinational force 
yugoslav diplomats said loncar conferred today with iraqs 
foreign minister tariq aziz and was to meet president saddam 
hussein later in the day 
also today the government denied reports of secret contacts 
with washington and soviet deputy foreign minister igor belousov 
left baghdad after a fourday visit 
loncars trip signaled an effort by the nonaligned movement to 
negotiate a settlement as the pressure on saddam to relinquish the 
conquered emirate now designated iraqs 19th province mounts 
daily 
yugoslavia is the current chairman of the group which includes 
kuwait and iraq 
the yugoslav diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
declined to comment on reports that loncar will discuss with saddam 
details of a nonaligned peace initiative 
loncar last month visited iran the united arab emirates syria 
and jordan for talks on the crisis 
aziz said before beginning discussions with loncar that there 
has been no breakthrough in the stalemate over fixing a date for a 
proposed visit to baghdad by secretary of state james a baker iii 
no progress has so far been made on this issue he told 
reporters 
both sides accuse the other of stalling saddam has said he is 
prepared for serious and constructive dialogue with the 
americans but diplomats see little sign of any meaningful talks 
between washington and baghdad 
iraqs information minister latif nussayif jassim today denied 
reports of secret talks after radio monte carlo quoted unidentified 
diplomatic sources in cairo as saying iraq was considering some 
ideas proposed by washington 
the radio said these include an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait in 
exchange for assuarnces that it will not be attacked by the 
multinational force that is expected to total more than half a 
million personnel by the end of january 
these are ridiculous ideas and figments of the imagination 
the official iraqi news agency quoted jassim as saying 
he reiterated the iraqi position that there will be no pullout 
from kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 a un security council 
resolution authorizes the use of force if iraq does not withdraw by 
jan 15 
the iraqis appear adamant that any negotiations must include 
linkage between an iraqi pullout from kuwait with an israeli 
withdrawal from occupied arab territory designed a palestinian 
homeland 
president bush is equally adamant that there is no linkage 
belousov the soviet envoy met saddam thursday but no details 
of their talks have been released 
in an interview with the semiofficial aljomhuriya daily today 
belousov said they covered bilateral relations and issues of 
mutual interest specially those related to the gulf crisis 
moscow has made repeated diplomatic efforts since the invasion 
to avert the threat of war there was no indication whether 
belousovs visit had any positive effect in this regard 
belousov told aljomhuriya that the majority of soviet contract 
workers left in iraq will leave before jan 10 
most of the 10000 soviet citizens who were stranded in iraq at 
the outbreak of the crisis have already left 
the soviet embassy said 160 soviets employed mainly in oil and 
power installations will be staying on 
amid the apparently faltering diplomatic campaign the iraqis 
stepped up preparations for war with reports that special commando 
squads are being trained for behindthelines suicide attacks on 
american forces in saudi arabia 
aljomhuriya told iraqs 17 million people today particularly 
those in baghdad and other cities to be prepared for mock air raid 
warnings to test civil defense drills baghdad already staged mock 
drills this month 
in another development that underlined baghdads isolation the 
iraqi news agency reported that all iraqi employees of the arab 
league including its deputy undersecretary salah almoukhtar 
have resigned in protest over the transfer of the leagues 
headquarters to cairo from tunis 
the transfer was approved by the majority of league members 
including egypt which have denounced the invasion of kuwait and 
which have joined the multinational force in saudi arabia 
the headquarters was moved from cairo in 1979 when egypts 
membership of the league was suspended because of its peace treaty 
with israel egypt was allowed back into the arab fold last year

supporters are xhosas 
an inkatha statement late friday protested anc plans for 
increased demonstrations strikes and other mass action in natal

prime minister toshiki kaifu today revamped his 
cabinet replacing his justice minister who drew fire for insulting 
american blacks however the departing justice minister received a 
powerful party post 
kaifus 10monthold cabinet resigned earlier in the day under 
intense party pressure to allow other senior politicians in the 
governing liberal democratic party to obtain prestigious government 
posts 
but kaifu scored a partial victory over powerful party kingpins 
by keeping out some scandaltainted politicians 
no major policy changes were expected although both the 
minister of international trade and industry kabun muto and 
agriculture minister tomio yamamoto were replaced the move could 
affect trade negotiations with the united states and other 
countries 
seventeen new members were named in the 21member cabinet it 
was kaifus third cabinet reshuffle since he rose from being a 
member of a weak party faction to prime minister in august 1989 
the prime minister however succeeded in retaining principal 
cabinet members including foreign minister taro nakayama finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto and chief cabinet secretary misoji 
sakamoto 
japan is facing mounting problems and we needed to maintain 
our continuity sakamoto the principal government spokesman 
told reporters he cited soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
scheduled visit in april the persian gulf crisis and strains in 
relations over trade 
prior to the cabinet reshuffle kaifus public ratings had been 
declining on charges of indecisiveness in responding to the gulf 
crisis but the key question for kaifu had been whether he 
possessed the clout to resist demands by senior party leaders to 
bring back politicians tainted by the recruit influencepeddling 
scandal last year 
the recruit jobplacement conglomerate had offered lucrative 
unlisted stock to influential politicians kaifu was named prime 
minister mostly because his mr clean image positioned him as a 
compromise replacement for those affected by the scandal 
none of the new cabinet members had been connected with the 
recruit scandal 
among those who will not be back is embattled justice minister 
seiroku kajiyama who again apologized for making racist remarks 
about american blacks that stirred outrage in the united states and 
other countries this fall 
after touring a redlight district in tokyo on sept 20 
kajiyama had compared foreign prostitutes in japan to american 
blacks saying they ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they 
move into 
i feel relieved now that i quit my post kajiyama said 
however shortly after resigning he was appointed chairman of the 
liberal democratic partys legislative affairs committee an 
important post 
the annual rotation of cabinet posts has become a party 
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial position 
after serving five or six terms in parliament 
kaifu earlier said he would not announce a cabinet change before 
jan 1 in an effort to display independence but apparently changed 
his mind under pressure from party leaders 
the governing party is comprised of five major factions each 
headed by a powerful politician who aspires to become prime 
minister and to win cabinet posts for his allies 
among the key new cabinet members is the minister of 
international trade and industry eiichi nakao 60 an eightterm 
lawmaker who formerly served as directorgeneral of the economic 
planning agency 
the new agriculture minister is motoji kondo 60 a fiveterm 
lawmaker in his first cabinet post

israeli officials say december will be a record 
month for immigration setting off new debate on how to tackle the 
deepening housing crisis 
about 4000 newcomers are expected most of them soviet jews 
some officials are urging the government take a greater role in 
housing construction others are calling for such stopgap measures 
as creating tent cities or putting newcomers in trailers atop 
buildings or in bomb shelters 
december will be a record month in the history of immigration 
in israel simcha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish 
agency told a news conference friday 
about 40000 jews are expected to immigrate to israel this 
month 35000 of them from the soviet union said dinitz whose 
agency assists the israeli government in transporting and 
resettling immigrants 
the pace of immigration has accelerated in recent weeks because 
of increasing political and economic uncertainty in the soviet 
union and better transportation arrangements by israel dinitz told 
a news conference 
the government expects more than 200000 immigrants this year 
about 90 percent of them soviets the total will be second only to 
1949 when more than 239000 immigrants arrived in the state 
created a year earlier 
the flood of newcomers has put a severe strain on housing 
nationwide driving up rents and forcing many families to double up 
in scarce units 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz advocates purchasing tents to 
house up to 20 percent of the 400000 soviets expected next year 
there will be no choice but to adopt this solution he was 
quoted as saying friday in the hebrew newspaper maariv he noted 
that modern tents can be equipped with lights heating and 
appliances 
dinitz rejected tents as an outdated response to a housing 
shortage 
in 1990 i think ingenuity can find better accommodation than 
tents especially in winter dinitz said urging the installation 
of more mobile homes 
dinitz urged the government to take over construction he said 
the government set aside funds this year for 45000 new housing 
units but only 27000 had been started by private contractors 
in the interim he said we will have to use public 
buildings army camps hostels hotels every available space 
israeli mayors have suggested immigrants be put in bomb 
shelters and housing minister ariel sharon said thursday that 
small mobile homes should be put on apartment house rooftops and in 
the back yards of houses to accommodate the crush 
soviets have been pouring into israel since the spring of 1989 
when the soviet union eased its policy on exit permits 
the number has grown each month this year and the government 
has ordered the el al national airline to use every available plane 
for immigrants this week planes have been arriving at halfhour 
intervals from transit stops in hungary romania and poland 
the government predicts that 1 million soviets will arrive by 
the end of 1992 and dinitz said the figure could exceed 2 million 
before the wave of immigration ends the countrys current 
population is about 45 million 
dinitz repeated the governments claim that it was not directing 
the new immigrants to settle in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip home to 17 million palestinians many of the arabs were 
forced from israel when the state was created in 1948 
he said only a few are settling there he said estimating the 
number at less than 05 percent 
his estimate did not include arab east jerusalem captured with 
the west bank in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed by 
israel an estimated 4500 soviets now live in the arab sector of 
the city according to western diplomats 
palestinians have opposed the soviet immigration fearing they 
will be displaced and arguing that israel will be less inclined to 
give up the occupied territories

the united states and iraq remain at an impasse over dates for 
direct talks iraq had invited secretary of state james a baker 
iii to visit on jan 12 but the bush administration say that is 
too close to the jan 15 deadline washington has said any 
bakersaddam meeting must take place before thursday 
in other developments 
vice president dan quayle was scheduled to leave late today for 
a new years visit to us troops sent to the gulf region since 
iraq invaded kuwait nearly five months ago quayles intinerary 
included trips to military outposts in the saudi arabian desert 
iraqi media reported up to 300000 paramilitary troops in the 
kurdish region have been reactivated to shore up the countrys 
northern border with turkey part of the multinational coalition 
against iraqi president saddam hussein 
lloyds shipping intelligence has advised vessels off saudi 
arabias northern gulf coast to use extreme caution after two 
drifting mines were found earlier this week near the zuluf oil 
field the friday report did not say who detected and destroyed the 
mines 
a 66yearold swedish peace activist was hospitalized in oman 
for a heart condition after us forces intercepted an iraqi ship 
she was aboard in the arabian sea omani health ministry officials 
said margaret andersson was on a cardiac monitor in a hospital 
after the us navy airlifted her from the freighter she 
reportedly suffered chest pains after the boarding which was 
condemned by baghdad the freighter was carrying sugar and other 
goods in violation of a un embargo on iraq 
british and us military officials have not given details of 
plans to inoculate troops against biological weapons which are 
germs used to carry diseases such as cholera anthrax and typhoid 
about 21000 british civilians in the gulf region will also 
receive gas masks officials said 
cia director william webster has said iraq has stockpiles of 
germs which can be delivered on warheads or by lowflying planes 
iraq has denied the allegations 
some of the problems facing the inoculation program is the wide 
variety of vaccines needed and the month or more needed for some 
vaccines to take effect military and medical analysts said 
the british government on friday ordered 390 army meical 
reservists sent to the gulf after too few volunteers came forward 
it is the first military conscription in britain since forces were 
sent to cyprus borneo and aden in 1965 
saddam has sent an estimated 500000 troops to southern iraq and 
kuwait since he seized the emirate on aug 2 in a dispute over oil 
land and money

president bush was named time magazines 1990 
man of the year the magazine announced today or rather the two 
sides of president bush were dubbed the men of the year by 
the magazine which praised bushs foreign policy work while 
criticizing his domestic role 
each year the magazine chooses as its woman or man of the year 
a person who for better or for worse has the most impact on the 
years events 
this year time said it chose to feature the two faces of 
president bush on the cover of its jan 7 issue which hits 
newsstands monday because he fits both aspects of the magazines 
definition 
on foreign policy bush was a study in resoluteness and 
mastery while domestically he was just as strongly marked by 
wavering and confusion 
the magazine credited bush for having raised a vision of a new 
world order with his leadership in the creation of the embargo 
and military buildup against iraq that puts him in a position to 
have a favorable impact on the course of events 
meanwhile domestically bush has left things alone until he 
could no longer avoid taking action 
the two sides of bush show what interests him according to the 
magazine 
global diplomacy is what he has trained for and what absorbs 
him domestic affairs are just not as much fun time said 
in an interview with time bush blamed the democraticcontrolled 
congress for stalling his domestic plans 
to accomplish things you have first got to beat down the 
democrats and thats not true in foreign affairs bush said 
about iraq bush said his gut feeling is that saddam hussein 
will withdraw from kuwait 
but that flies in the face of what some of the arab leaders 
tell me which is that he cannot get out he cannot do in kuwait 
what he did in iran he cannot do it and survive domestically 
bush said 
four others cited by time as among the years most important 
newsmakers were saddam nelson mandela helmut kohl and boris 
yeltsin 
bush is the ninth us president or presidentelect to be 
selected for the man of the year issue the others are franklin d 
roosevelt 1932 1934 and 1941 harry s truman 1945 and 1948 
dwight d eisenhower 1959 also selected in 1944 before he became 
president john f kennedy in 1961 lyndon b johnson in 1964 and 
1967 richard m nixon winner in 1971 and cowinner in 1972 with 
henry kissinger presidentelect jimmy carter in 1976 and ronald 
reagan winner as presidentelect in 1980 and cowinner with yuri

authorities blamed the first snowstorm of the 
season for an electrical fire that trapped four rushhour trains in 
a smokefilled subway tunnel killing one person and injuring 150 
others a second rider died of her injuries today 
in boston authorities investigating a trolley accident that 
injured 33 people friday said tests showed the trolley driver had 
high levels of alcohol in his system it was the second rail 
accident this month in the citys back bay section 
the driver of the trolley which rammed a streetcar that was 
unloading passengers blamed faulty brakes for the collision 
officials said but investigators ruled that out as a possible 
cause said peter dimond spokesman for the massachusetts bay 
transportation authority 
the fire friday morning in new york filled trains with smoke in 
a subway tunnel linking manhattan and brooklyn fire and transit 
officials said melting snow from a 7inch snowfall overnight 
apparently caused an electrical shortcircuit 
passengers heard explosions and then saw smoke first pouring 
into the tunnel and then into their trains 
we really thought we were gone that we wouldnt see new 
years said gertrude hoyte a 51yearold brooklyn resident 
trapped in the tunnel some people began vomiting into their 
newspapers she said 
people were screaming were going to die and others 
prayed out loud said 28yearold dana sullivan 
andrew rea 29 said that as smoke began filling the train it 
got so bad you couldnt see halfway down the car 
a lot of people passed out said naomi smallswatson 23 
transit authority spokeswoman caren gardner said the exact cause 
was unclear but that snow may have fallen onto the electrified 
third rail and caused an electrical cable to short 
the dead man was identified by transit police spokesman al 
oleary as peter hagen 35 of smithtown the cause of death was 
under investigation 
another rider a 37yearold massapequa park woman died this 
morning at long island college hospital in brooklyn said said 
nursing supervisor adriene kushner se had been revived at the 
hospital friday after appearing dead at the scene 
authorities said 150 people were injured including some police 
and firefighters injuries ranged from smoke inhalation to cuts and 
bruises 
transit police capt michael ansbro said 300 to 400 people were 
on the 10car train that carried most of the injured 
fire commissioner carlos m rivera said the accident couldnt 
have been prevented its something that is beyond our control 
nature does what nature wants to do 
bostons green line trolley crash occurred during morning rush 
hour when one trolley rammed the rear of a second parked in the 
underground arlington street station transit officials said each 
had about 40 people aboard 
the driver in the rear car the car that did the hitting a 
20year veteran was found to test positive for alcohol dimond 
said the 64yearold driver whose name was not released was 
suspended without pay pending the outcome of the investigation 
dimond said 
dimond declined to specify the drivers bloodalcohol content 
but said it was high he said investigators had ruled out brake 
failure and the signal system as possible causes 
ernest jones a passenger on the stationary trolley said one 
minute he was reading his newspaper the next the lights were out 
and he saw at least four people bleeding from head injuries 
i was looking at the lady across from me next thing i knew 
the lights went out and she was on the floor he said i saw 
one man in the back on the floor on his back crying obviously in 
agony hurt 
most of the injured people were treated and released at area 
hospitals one was seriously hurt and taken to new england medical 
center and another was admitted to university hospital 
more than 260 people were injured dec 12 when an amtrak train 
derailed in the area

the pentagons plan to inoculate troops in the 
persian gulf against germ warfare agents is a medical roll of the 
dice because no single vaccine works against all of the hundreds 
of microbes that could be used in a biological attack experts say 
for a military force to be immune to any such assault the 
troops would have to be vaccinated weeks or even months in advance 
and the vaccines used would have to exactly match the microbes used 
in the attack the medical authorities say 
with most vaccines it takes from two to four weeks to develop 
adequate immune protection said dr bradley sack a johns 
hopkins university expert on infectious diseases and often he 
said full protection for some specific diseases could take up to 
several months 
to develop immunity the body of each soldier would have to be 
exposed to a vaccine and then have time to build up the billions of 
antibodies needed to repel the disease 
if vaccinations of us forces dont start until next week sack 
said it is unlikely that the troops would all have developed the 
full immunity needed by jan 15 the unset date for iraq to pull 
out of kuwait or face military action 
us military officials refuse to identify any particular 
disease for which troops will be vaccinated but published reports 
have said that iraqs biological arsenal may include these 
diseases typhoid cholera anthrax rabbit fever and botulism 
this group says dr sanford kuvin vice chairman of the 
national foundation for infectious diseases is only the short 
list of possibilities 
if you restrict the biological warfare possibilities to the 
short list of common things it could probably be dealt with in a 
moderately effective way by the us military he said 
but the real problem said kuvin is that nature has provided so 
many microbe warriors that can be marshaled into armies 
the menu of lethality is very long said kuvin there are 
innumerable viral diseases and i dont know how you could make a 
cocktail of vaccines that would be effective against them all 
and there are problems even with the short list 
there is a vaccine for anthrax the most popular candidate named 
by experts as a possible biological weapon but the vaccine is not 
commercially available and few american doctors even in the 
military have ever dealt with it 
theres very little of that disease in this country said 
sack 
but another expert who asked not to be named said that the 
military is thought to have developed an anthrax vaccine designed 
for use in combat situations 
cholera another disease candidate on the short list has 
virtually no effective vaccine sack said there is an experimental 
oral vaccine that has been tested in bangladesh but it has not 
been tried in this country 
ive heard that the military may want to use it he said 
of the little we have it seems to be the most effective it 
takes at least three doses over a month 
for typhoid there is an oral vaccine that provides 65 to 70 
percent protection with few side effects it requires four doses 
over eight days and immunity is good within 10 days of the last 
dose said sack 
science has no vaccine for rabbit fever or tularemia neither 
is there one for botulism the common foodborne bacteria both 
diseases can be fatal but both will respond to antibiotics 
kuvin said however the biological weapons that are of most 
concern to him are the hundreds of microbes that are rarely or 
never seen in the united states but which could be devastating to 
american troops 
there are organisms he said that spring up from africa or asia 
or south america wipe out large populations and then burn 
themselves out only to pop up again years later somewhere else 
they bear names like blue nile virus rift valley fever marburg 
virus dengue fever or lassa fever 
some of these are almost universally lethal said kuvin and 
there is no proven vaccine for many of them 
and even if there were vaccines for them all which should 
american troops be protected against that said the experts is 
the military and biological gamble 
if the americans choose correctly then the us troops would be 
protected but if the soldiers are inoculated for one group of 
diseases and then are attacked with weapons containing a totally 
different disease the results said kuvin could be 
devastating 
the physician however said all of these factors are wellknown 
to the army experts who have studied biological warfare for years 
i know for a fact that the army has the best microbe hunters 
in the world said kuvin if anyone does they have the experts 
to solve the problems we have discussed

for the new congress convening on thursday 
the questions of peace and war are waiting with added urgency as 
the days dwindle toward the jan 15 for iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait 
five months of intermittent debate and a dozen house and senate 
hearings have produced no answers and scant guidance to define the 
role of the democratic congress in a crisis under republican 
management 
at this point its a crisis on hold for the holidays 
at a quiet capitol recorded telephone messages report some 
offices closed until after the new year president bush is at camp 
david md on an 11day break 
theres little traffic and less tension in the capital even as 
reinforcements are deployed in the persian gulf and the saudi 
arabian desert building to the troop strength that could deliver 
on the us threat to take the offensive after midjanuary thats 
when the united nations has authorized the use of force if 
necessary 
according to the democratic leaders of congress us forces 
cannot be sent to fight without congressional approval according 
to the republican administration bush already has all the 
authority he needs to act 
that debate will resume when congress does it wont be 
conclusive the answer has been elusive for two centuries under a 
constitutional system that makes the president the commander in 
chief and empowers only congress to declare war 
bush has met with congressional leaders several times over the 
gulf crisis and according to senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas will do so again thursday as soon as the new congress is 
sworn in defense secretary richard cheney and secretary of state 
james a baker iii also are expected to participate in the 
sessions 
there were demands during the fall that congress be summoned 
back to declare war there were calls for a resolution of approval 
for bushs policy of threatening military action against iraqi 
occupation of kuwait there were proposals to invoke the creaky 
machinery of the war powers system under which a president cant 
send troops into danger unless congress approves 
none of that happened and none of it is likely to happen now 
but in one form or another the 102nd congress is going to have 
to come to clear majority decisions on the persian gulf possibly 
but not necessarily on direct questions of policy certainly on the 
money and manpower to back up that policy 
the administration will need a supplemental appropriation of up 
to 20 billion early this year to finance operation desert shield 
callup authority for some support units summoned to active duty 
will begin expiring in march unless congress extends it or bush 
declares a national emergency 
and there may have to be action later in the year to change the 
timetable for cutbacks that are supposed to reduce active duty 
military forces by at least 80000 before next sept 30 
an attempt to write a policy resolution and get it through house 
and senate would be risky for both congress and the white house 
bush has been quoted as telling members of congress that he would 
welcome a resolution of support along the lines of the united 
nations resolution authorizing force after jan 15 but if youre 
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and 
argue about it then that may not be helpful 
resolutions endorsing his policy were adopted by overwhelming 
votes in the house and senate early in october backing continued 
action by the president to deter iraqi aggression and protect 
american lives and vital interests but the authors of those 
measures said they covered only what had been done to that point 
and did not authorize the use of force 
when those measures passed the strategy for forcing iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait was built around economic sanctions against 
iraq with the united states assigned to defend saudi arabia 
against any attack by saddam husseins forces 
on nov 8 bush ordered us forces doubled to create the 
capability and raise the possibility of military action to retake 
kuwait democratic leaders were told of the decision shortly before 
bush announced it and support that had been almost unanimous began 
to fray with democrats urging patience to give economic sanctions 
more time to work 
but democrats cant risk becoming the party of dissent while 
american forces are at risk that could weaken the us position in 
the current confrontation at a time when bush says the best way to 
avoid war is to convince saddam hussein that he faces war unless he 
relents and it could do them lasting political damage vice 
president dan quayle produced a preview of a republican 
counterattack saying earlier this month that patience at any 
price would amount to appeasement of saddam hussein 
as the debate resumes sen george j mitchell dmaine the 
majority leader says whatever the differences on timing and 
tactics the united states is united on the goal of getting iraq 
out of kuwait 
the question is how

an air force weather forecaster 
said saturday the us military isnt getting important data 
collected by saudi arabia even as winter sandstorms and choppy 
seas pose new obstacles for usled forces 
although the kingdom does supply some information it does not 
share data on wind speed and direction fearing that teletype 
reports would aid iraq in launching a chemical or biological 
attack the forecaster said 
its not as good as what we get in the states said capt 
judy dickey referring to the extensive network of weather 
reporting stations operated by the military and the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration 
they arent transmitting any wind data because of the chemical 
threat they dont want the upper level winds to go out worldwide 
so the iraqis could pick it up she said 
she said the forecasts are good enough to provide planning 
information for commanders to help them decide whether to attack 
but still the us military could use the wind data to help plan a 
defense against chemical attack she said 
capt dickey who produces forecasts for the 1st tactical 
fighter wing said the nightmare condition would be a shamal 
a violent 100milewide sandstorm that could shut down air 
operations and impede ground units in combat 
the shamal or northwest wind is a rare occurrence that drives 
sand at speeds of more than 50 mph and can cause haze as high as 
18000 feet sand propelled at that speed can strip paint from 
cars 
moreover she said the same conditions that give rise to the 
shamal also can cause smaller disturbances that affect specific 
regions hampering air ground and sea operations 
at christmas for example dickey thought a shamal was brewing 
blowing sand cut visibility to one mile with winds at 32 mph 
that was sort of a little precursor to a shamal she said 
sort of a little appetizer i guess 
she said forecasters could only give a twotothree day warning 
of a shamal 
the united states has a limited weather staff in saudi arabia 
split primarily between the air force and the navy capt dickey 
said measurement of weather conditons is the most difficult 
problem 
comprehensive data which requires the regular launching of 
weather balloons and surface measurements from a wide area are not 
collected regularly by the military she said they depend on the 
saudis for the rest 
the 25yearold captain from anaheim calif said some data is 
collected from occasional balloon launches by the marine corps 
when they do it we get great data but they dont have enough 
balloons to do it twice a day like we do in the states 
the military is coping by pooling data obtained from pilots but 
such general information is useless for pinpointing the localized 
dust devils that play havoc with ground forces the best the 
military can do is warn ground forces that conditions are favorable 
for a sandstorm in a given region 
at sea military sources have said swells of eight feet and 
greater have been observed high seas could delay amphibious 
landings by some landing craft 
soldiers are already coping with markedly colder temperatures in 
eastern saudi arabia capt dickey said january the month in 
which combat operations could begin is one of the coldest with 
overnight lows in the 40s 
its a big switch from 100degreeplus temperatures that greeted 
the first units of the us force deployed to saudi arabia 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
in the northern desert temperatures plunged to 34 degrees 
thursday and friday night forcing soldiers to burrow deeper into 
their sleeping bags 
you can feel it down to the bone if you dont wear your 
longjohns youll be freezing said army spec hector macias 25 
of el paso texas

taking lives and threatening what was left of californias 
frostravaged citrus crop and the very trees themselves 
the latest cold front accompanied by howling winds freezing 
rain and snow hit most of the continental united states on friday 
leaving only parts of the southeast untouched 
it was expected to keep an icy grip on most of the nation at 
least through sunday although parts of the east coast including 
new york new jersey connecticut massachusetts and pennsylvania

ditches or into each other on iceglazed interstate 35 north of des 
moines but no serious injuries were reported 
all i know is its really bad said lori pruismann a 
cashier at touchdown truck stop near webster city most truckers 
are staying right where theyre at 
one day after pennsylvania residents struggled with snow up to 
16 inches deep they are facing another hurdle to driving fog 
the whole states pretty much blanketed in fog doug young 
a meteorologist with the national weather service said today 
the fog is produced by warm air moving over the cold snow 
causing the snow to evaporate visibility in many places this 
morning ranged from a halfmile to zero according to the weather 
service 
in california highs were expected to reach the 40s and 50s but 
inland lows in the 20s were predicted further threatening the 
states embattled citrus crop 
it wont be the bitter cold that occurred last weekend but 
people will still have to take care to shelter plants and 
animals said betty reo of the national weather service in 
california in the coldest areas farmers will suffer more crop 
damage 
growers estimate half the states navel orange crop 288 
million worth was destroyed by the last cold snap now they are 
worried about the citrus trees themselves 
how much can the trees take night after night after night 
and then they get hit again said tom mcnair a statistician with 
the state department of agriculture 
elsewhere the latest round of storms knocked out power to tens 
of thousands on friday stranded thousands more on roads in homes 
or at airports resulted in hundreds of injuries and claimed 
several lives 
there have been more than 90 weatherrelated deaths since the 
wave of cold began dec 18

in july 1989 a band of reporters quit a 
prochina newspaper in hong kong because they opposed beijings 
crackdown on a movement for democracy and wanted to report the 
truth 
they started a magazine on china and called it contemporary it 
was going to be different independent and analytical 
but a year after the first issue hit the stands contemporary is 
foundering hurt by falling circulation a virtual boycott on 
advertising and a lack of reporters willing to brave criticism from 
hardline chinese officials to report the news 
whats happening to contemporary sums up whats happening to 
hong kongs once freewheeling press 
1997 the year communist china takes control of the british 
colony looms as a dangerous deadline for the media in hong kong 
reporters and editors say they face a choice either dont 
insult china or leave the profession or even the territory 
contemporary for example has lost about half of its 15 
founding members all of whom came from the hardline wen wei po 
newspaper some have immigrated to the west others have taken jobs 
at less controversial publications 
already one religious newsletter is moving its headquarters from 
hong kong to bangkok several other international publications are 
believed to be exploring the same 
were adopting a waitandsee attitude said barry wain 
publisher of the americanowned asian wall street journal our 
attitude is that weve made no plans to leave 
but the bulk of hong kongs 60 plus daily newspapers and 600 
plus magazines live and breath the territory they have nowhere to 
go 
to succeed reporters at chinese and englishlanguage 
publications say one has to practice selfcensorship and there are 
fewrewards for bucking the trend 
exploring sensitive topics scares advertisers loses reporters 
access to news conferences and doesnt necessarily win more 
readers 
in the last few months contemporarys circulation has dropped 
from 10000 to 8000 despite a series of wellwritten pieces on 
chinas military and several scoops about the workings of the 
xinhua news agency chinas de facto embassy to the territory 
its reporters are now banned from china 
when i started this thing i firmly believed that a society as 
rich as hong kong could support a serious magazine said ching 
cheong contemporarys editorinchief now im dismayed to find 
thats not the case 
cheong said the magazine needed to reach 15000 to break even 
and thats with advertising 
but contemporarys ad space has dwindled to nothing due to 
apparent pressure from beijingcontrolled companies on potential 
advertisers cheong said 
one americaneducated advertising executive speaking on 
condition of anonymity said he received a phone call earlier this 
year from a chineseowned company asking him why his firm placed 
ads in contemporary 
it was subtle but the message was clear if we wanted 
mainland business we couldnt deal with contemporary he said 
attempts by journalists to quantify such pressure have failed 
said emily lau a correspondent for the hong kongbased far eastern 
economic review and the president of the hong kong journalists 
association 
several months ago the associations executive committee 
proposed a seminar on the topic no one attended 
its a pretty dismal situation lau said everybody knows 
its happening but nobody has the guts to confront the issue 
under a historic agreement between china and britain the 
chinese have promised to preserve hong kongs way of life for at 
least 50 years after beijing takes over in 1997 clause 5 of the 
agreement guarantees freedom of speech and the press 
but faith in chinas pledge has been shaken in the past year by 
the crackdown on a prodemocracy movement in beijing chinese 
authorities arrested dozens of mainland reporters and editors and 
closed or reorganized under hardline leadership several newspapers 
if they treat their reporters like that how will they treat 
us after 97 asks juan tze a leading political cartoonist in 
the territory 
few reporters and editors in the territory have much trust in 
britains ability to keep china to its word 
the colonial government itself passed a law in 1988 that allows 
the banning of films that could seriously damage relations with 
other countries most notably china it was most recently invoked 
earlier this year when the first half of a taiwanese film 
mainland china 1989 was cut because it included interviews with 
prominent chinese dissidents 
to increase its influence china is also moving into hong kongs 
media business 
in october the xinhua news agency announced the launching of 
chinas first magazine in the territory a glossy periodical named 
bauhinia after hong kongs territorial flower in 1988 several 
beijingowned companies merged to form sinounited publishing ltd 
the largest publishing house and book seller in hong kong 
this is not a game cheong said its a serious political 
struggle 
but ironically it appears to be a struggle that interests few 
people in the territory 
contemporarys circulation for example pales when compared to 
the 130000 of the ming pao weekly which serves up a fare of 
gossip glossy watch advertisements and revealing photographs of 
slinky chinese models 
and of the territorys 60 plus daily newspapers more focus on 
horse racing a local obsession than anything else

after a 30year political career gov michael s 
dukakis is the same cool untiring technocrat and unflappable 
optimist but if theres any change in dukakis as he prepares to 
leave office thursday it may be that he finally managed to lighten 
up a little bit 
he has made spontaneous jokes beyond the canned lines provided 
by speech writers hes used humor to take on old adversaries hes 
shaken hands and posed for photographs with anybody who asked one 
day he started whistling during a break in a press conference 
on a recent helicopter trip across the state dukakis refrained 
from emotional reminiscing with an accompanying reporter but among 
old political allies nostalgia and an uncommon lightheartedness 
hung in the air 
dukakis recalled for example a campaign trip in the early 
1980s when the pants to his suit split 
im walking around with my back to the wall trying to get the 
endorsement of the teachers he said they said take your 
coat off and stay 
the memories span a political career that began as a town 
meeting member in his hometown of brookline the birthplace of john 
f kennedy dukakis still lives there in a modest residential 
neighborhood 
born to greek immigrants nov 3 1933 dukakis went to brookline 
high school then swarthmore college and harvard university law 
school he was first elected to the massachusetts house in 1962 in 
1970 he lost a bid to become lieutenant governor 
he won the governors seat in 1974 but after raising taxes and 
cutting social spending he lost the democratic primary to edward 
king in 1978 the resilient dukakis came back in 1982 beating king 
in a rematch and won a third term by a landslide in 1986 
dukakis then became one of the socalled seven dwarfs seeking 
the democratic nomination he was at the height of his popularity 
when he left the atlanta convention with his partys endorsement 
but his performance in the waning weeks of the campaign 
disappointed many and voters went overwhelmingly for bush 
i gave it my best shot dukakis said after he lost 
two months later with what he had ballyhooed as the states 
miracle economy collapsing he announced he would not seek 
reelection as governor 
while the states financial rating neared the junkbond level 
and his popularity plummeted dukakis wife kitty drank rubbing 
alcohol and sought treatment for alcoholism 
then his lieutenant governor evelyn murphy caused an uproar by 
threatening to implement programs of her own while dukakis was out 
of the state he postponed the trip and squelched the rebellion 
dukakis was steadfast throughout he kept cutting ribbons 
swearing in judges and breaking ground on new projects through his 
final days in office 
and as he leaves office even ron kaufman a white house aide 
and former state republican activist had words of praise 
youve got to give the governor some points kaufman said 
he with all his problems now brought a sense of honesty to 
government that no one ever doubted 
dukakis counts among his major achievements in office a job 
training program for welfare recipients a bill that made health 
care available to all state residents and economic incentives that 
helped keep a boom running through much of the 1980s 
he hasnt ruled out the possibility of another run for political 
office although he says thats not the first thing on his mind 
these days 
his immediate plans call for him to travel to australia then to 
hawaii where he will teach political science at the university of 
hawaii 
william schneider the political analyst whos teaching at 
boston college this year gives dukakis little hope of resurrecting 
his presidential aspirations 
id say hes looked upon with contempt schneider said 
hes probably the most despised man in american politics along 
with richard nixon because democrats believe i think unfairly 
that he lost the election through incompetence 
but if a democrat wins the presidency dukakis may find a 
position schneider said 
he would probably play some role in that administration quite 
likely in the cabinet in the health area schneider said 
another former failed democratic presidential hopeful walter 
mondale urged dukakis to take time off and to give himself time 
mondale noted his onetime boss former president jimmy carter 
has found renewed respect and popularity since leaving office 
mikes had a tough couple of years here when this settles 
hes going to find that hes a lot more respected than he might 
gather mondale said i think theres a healing process that 
doesnt come quickly

confined to a house in a wealthy dhaka 
suburb ousted president hussain muhammad ershad reads poetry and 
occasionally asks his guards plaintively about weather or politics 
outside the capitals streets and newspapers are full of the 
gossip that until ershads fall was talked about only in the byways 
of the bazaars and the private rooms of the countrys rich and 
wouldbe powerful people 
the allegations gathered steam and contributed to the outrage 
that finally forced the 60yearold exgeneral to relinquish power 
after two months of protests led by opposition parties and 
university students ershad resigned as president on dec 6 eight 
years after he seized power in a bloodless coup 
newspapers including governmentowned ones that once carried 
only laudatory accounts of ershads public deeds now print saucy 
stories full of allegations of corruption and clandestine romances 
ershads girlfriend is in jail blared a headline in the 
bengalilanguage inqilab the day after zeenat mosharaf wife of a 
top official in the ershad government was arrested along with her 
husband 
a headline in the englishlanguage morning sun said fast lady 
and husband arrested 
for the past three years opposition politicians had been 
doggedly demanding ershads resignation accusing him in tedious 
rhetoric of running a corrupt military dictatorship but this time 
from the bazaars the campuses and the mosques come new 
antiershad slogans 
he has been denounced as an emperor and a womanizer 
epithets that struck an unsavory tone of opulence and decadence in 
his impoverished islamic nation eighty percent of bangladeshs 110 
million people live below the poverty line which means they cant 
afford enough food to meet minimum health requirements 
just before and after ershads fall from power teenage boys 
dressed up in womens clothing and paraded through the streets 
mockingly claiming to be presidential girlfriends 
with ershad and his wife raushan under house arrest and 
expected to stand trial on charges of corruption and abuse of 
power the newspapers have gone public with the longtalkedabout 
allegations of shady business deals and love affairs 
dainik bangla a governmentowned daily claimed ershad and 
zeenat mosharaf used to meet at a guest house owned by the 
bangladesh chemical industries corp zeenats husband mosharaf 
hossain was the companys chairman until 1988 when he was given a 
job in ershads government as secretary of the ministry of 
industries 
the newspaper claimed zeenat who is in her 40s got a bcic 
business deal worth 106 million in 1989 without submitting legal 
tenders 
another story now making the public rounds concerns mariam 
mumtaz a bangladeshi woman who lives in the united states and 
claims to be the second mrs ershad 
in 1986 britains observer newspaper quoted ms mumtaz as 
saying she secretly married ershad on aug 14 1982 after he 
forced her to divorce banker chowdhury badruddin early in 1990 
the story surfaced again in the new york post and londons sunday 
correspondent 
ms mumtaz was quoted as saying ershad had concealed 150 
million in secret bank accounts in the united states and 
switzerland 
now the stories are being reprinted in local newspapers along 
with a photo of ms mumtaz and ershad holding hands 
ershad and his relatives have made no public response to the 
allegations but a source at the home ministry said ershad has 
asked government permission to hire a lawyer to respond in court 
we have got the request for a lawyer from him its under 
study the source said speaking on condition he was not 
identified further he declined to give any other details 
ershad presumably is reading some of the newspaper reports 
despite his isolation some of the 150 guards assigned to watch him 
said he gets two local newspapers every day 
he does not talk much to us but he sometimes comes down to 
the lawn and usually asks about how politics are shaping up in the 
country one of the guards said on friday he was talking about 
weather 
the guard said raushan ershad rarely leaves her room and spends 
most of her time watching movies on a video machine 
but ershad sometimes behaves in a way that suggests he hates 
the loneliness he craves human contacts said another guard who 
like the first spoke on condition he not be identified

prime minister toshiki kaifu revamped his cabinet 
on saturday resisting pressure from party leaders to give posts to 
some powerful but scandaltainted politicians 
kaifu also jettisoned his justice minister who had drawn fire 
for insulting american blacks however the minister was given 
another important post 
both the minister of international trade and industry and the 
agriculture minister were also replaced a move that could affect 
some trade negotiations with the united states and other countries 
yet no major policy changes were expected from the reshuffle in 
which 17 new members were named to the 21member cabinet 
officials of the governing liberal democratic party said the 
administration was concerned with maintaining a unified front in 
the face of the persian gulf crisis and friction over international 
trade also soviet president mikhail gorbachev is scheduled to 
visit in april 
the annual rotation of cabinet posts has become a party 
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial position 
after serving five or six terms in parliament 
kaifu succeeded in keeping his three principal cabinet members 
foreign minister taro nakayama finance minister ryutaro hashimoto 
and chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto the principal 
government spokesman 
none of those named to the cabinet was linked to last years 
recruit influencepedding scandal kaifu was named prime minister 
mainly because his clean image positioned him as a compromise 
replacement for those affected by the scandal 
analysts said kaifu would have lost any remaining credibility 
had he opened his cabinet to senior politicians tainted by the 
affair in which the recruit jobplacement conglomerate had offered 
lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians 
underscoring the effort to distance the government from the 
scandal the new cabinet member agreed to refrain from stock 
transactions while in office kyodo news service reported 
the departing justice minister seiroku kajiyama again 
apologized for remarks made this fall in which he compared us 
blacks to prostitutes the comments provoked an international 
outcry 
i feel relieved now that i quit my post kajiyama told 
reporters however he was appointed chairman of the liberal 
democratic partys legislative affairs committee an important 
position 
kajiyama was replaced by megumu sato 66 who like nakao and 
kondo is a member of one of the partys three most powerful 
factions 
the new international trade minister is eiichi nakao 60 an 
eightterm lawmaker who formerly served as directorgeneral of the 
economic planning agenc he replaced kabun muto 
the new agriculture minister is motoji kondo 60 a fiveterm 
lawmaker in his first cabinet post replacing tomio yamamoto 
kaifus administration also includes its first woman since his 
last cabinet reshuffle in february she is akiko santo a 
48yearold former television personality and upper house member 
who was named directorgeneral of the science and technology

in the year since a defeated manuel noriega was 
dramatically delivered to the us justice system sideshows and 
legal maneuvers have repeatedly sidetracked the drugtrafficking 
case against him 
red underwear taperecorded conversations frozen swiss bank 
accounts missing documents contempt charges against a television 
network an exercise bicycle and endless wrangling over attorneys 
fees have overshadowed what was billed as a showcase trial that 
would cap the us invasion of panama 
there have been a lot of twists and turns us district 
judge william hoeveler reflected in an interview earlier this 
month its like the quest for the holy grail 
amid the hoopla prosecutors have strengthened their case 
quietly by plea bargaining with coconspirators who may be able to 
tie the deposed panamanian leader directly to drug payoffs 
the latest coup was a guilty plea dec 6 by luis del cid a 
former noriega aide who confessed to handing drug cash directly to 
his boss 
the most important developments have been the increased 
evidence said us attorney dexter lehtinen as for the 
unexpected hitches he said they will disappear and become a 
footnote to history 
just when that increased evidence will be heard by a jury is 
unclear since noriegas jan 3 surrender the trial date has 
slipped from march 1990 to january 1991 to spring 1991 the defense 
has asked it be postponed at least until june 
panama meanwhile is pursuing a 65 billion federal damage 
lawsuit against noriega and has asked for his extradition to face 
charges of murdering a major who attempted a 1989 coup on friday 
the head of the panamanian supreme court said noriega also is 
suspected in the 1985 decapitation slaying of leftist opponent hugo 
spadafora 
lead defense attorney frank rubino says he believes or at 
least hopes the drug case will be over in another year 
i think the general will be back in panama and running the 
country rubino says 
but hes not sure hell be the winning attorney rubino has 
announced he will withdraw unless the government finds a way to 
unfreeze some of 20 million tied up in european bank accounts 
he says he and his two fellow attorneys often work until 1130 
pm even though they havent been paid since noriegas surrender 
in january rubino has been forced to take other cases to pay the 
bills he complains giving him even less time to work on the 
complicated case 
he blames some of the controversies on overzealous prosecutors 
i would have thought that they would try to give the general a 
fair trial instead of doing everything they can to thwart it 
wiretapping his phones freezing his bank accounts rubino said 
rubinos complaints forced the us government to ask reluctant 
european authorities to release millions of dollars to the man the 
united states accuses of accepting 46 million from colombias 
medellin cocaine cartel to protect usbound drug shipments 
its peculiar on its face lehtinen said but its the 
same tension that is always apparent when the government believes a 
person is guilty yet still has a right to a fair trial 
noriega spurned a deal to give up power in exchange for 
dismissal of his february 1988 indictments his capture complete 
with red underwear purportedly to ward off the evil eye 
suspected cocaine that turned out to be tamale powder and rock n 
roll music blared into the vatican embassy resulted from an 
invasion the defense tried to have ruled illegal 
but the defense won a battle to prove noriega was a prisoner of 
war entitling him to wear his uniform in court and receive a red 
cross allotment when the united states opposed initial efforts to 
unfreeze the accounts because they were drugtainted the defense 
responded by saying noriega had received 11 million from us 
intelligence agencies 
us immigration officials then revealed they had enough 
evidence to indict noriega for alien smuggling as soon as his drug 
trial was over prompting a horrified us attorneys office to 
announce no such indictment was planned 
michael okane an attorney for codefendant daniel miranda 
angered noriegas lawyers when he sued the former panamanian leader 
on behalf of two photographers injured during the us invasion 
the combative okane also produced document logs that suggested the 
us government had removed some secret documents from files 
confiscated in panama a charge the government has denied 
noriegas quarters at the metropolitan correctional center 
outside of miami aroused ire in congress when it was revealed he 
had an exercise bicycle a phone a telecopier and a computer 
prison officials said security requirements made it cheaper to 
outfit the cell than move noriega who has the right to visit with 
attorneys and to exercise federal marshals have spent more than 
360000 on security and transportation for noriega the miami 
herald reported last week 
perhaps the biggest flap came over noriegas taped prison phone 
conversations some of which were telecast by cable news network 
hoeveler ordered the network to stop an order the us supreme 
court allowed to remain in force until the judge examined the tapes 
and decided they were harmless to the defense cnn still faces 
possible contempt penalties in that case 
federal prosecutors meanwhile launched their own investigation 
of the leaked tapes determining that one of their potential 
witnesses former noriega intelligence chief jose blandon was 
responsible he faces possible charges in the case

president bush says he has a gut feeling 
that iraqs saddam hussein will withdraw from kuwait even at risk 
of being toppled from power by his own people 
bush in a time magazine interview to be published monday also 
said he was confident he had chosen the right course in the persian 
gulf crisis 
maybe that is why i am i will not say relaxed but 
determined and i am not churning about it he said 
speculation about bushs state of mind has been growing as the 
united nations jan 15 deadline nears for iraqs pullout from 
kuwait the un security council has authorized the united states 
and its allies to use force after that date if iraq refuses to get 
out 
bush was spending the weekend at his camp david lodge in 
marylands catoctin mountains about 60 miles northwest of the 
capital with his brother jonathan and his family vice president 
dan quayle meanwhile was headed for saudi arabia to spend new 
years day with us troops and to consult with saudi leaders and 
the exiled emir of kuwait 
quayles staff said he bore no new diplomatic initiatives from 
bush 
at camp david the president reviewed reports on the gulf crisis 
saturday and signed an executive order that implemented his 
decision to grant the soviet union up to 1 billion in credits to 
buy farm products from the united states 
in signing the order bush waived the 1974 jacksonvanik 
amendment which barred aid to communist governments unless they 
allowed free emigration bush had announced on dec 12 that he 
would lift the ban until june 1991 because the soviets were 
allowing unprecedented numbers of jews to leave for israel 
the soviets asked for the farm aid to help them overcome severe 
food shortages moscow also will be entitled to buy up to 300 
million in us manufactured goods on credit 
asked whether he had made the decision to sacrifice american 
lives to implement the un resolution against iraq bush bristled 
in the time interview 
no i am not willing to sacrifice american lives i do not 
like the question put that way 
but he also said he was determined to do whatever was necessary 
to get iraq out that includes every inch of territory no 
concessions 
asked whether that means going to war bush answered 
my gut says he will get out of there but that flies in the 
face of what some of the arab leaders tell me which is that he 
cannot get out he cannot do it and survive domestically 
nonetheless bush added anyone who has fought a war is going 
to have to find a way to see that he does not fight another one 
saddam fought an eightyear war with iran which ended in 1988 with 
some 1 million casualties on both sides 
bush himself was a young flyer in world war ii and saw action 
against japan in the pacific 
bush or rather the two faces of president bush was chosen 
as times man of the year and will be featured on the magazines 
front cover that hits the newsstands monday his interview with the 
magazine was on dec 20 at the white house 
the annual distinction features a woman or man deemed to have 
made the most impact on the years events 
on foreign policy bush was a study in resoluteness and 
mastery while domestically he was just as strongly marked by 
wavering and confusion time said 
praising his ability to form and lead an international coalition 
against iraq but claiming he was unable to lead in similar fashion 
on domestic issues time asked bush for an explanation 
there is a very simple one we dont control either house of 
congress where democrats far outnumber republicans he said on 
domestic matters to accomplish things you have to first beat 
down the democrats and that is not true in foreign affairs 
bush said his administration could boast of some domestic gains 
but conceded much remained to be done among his goals for the 
coming year he listed improving the countrys education programs 
speeding progress on fighting drug abuse passing a strong 
anticrime bill and a new civil rights bill to replace the one bush 
vetoed this year 
but the president may also be in for a fight on foreign policy 
because democrats assert he must get congressional approval before 
he orders us troops to fight bush is expected to meet with the 
congressional leadership next thursday when the new congress will 
be sworn in

joe cruzan didnt want his daughter to 
become the focus of a national debate but she did 
antieuthanasia activists didnt want nancy cruzans 
lifesustaining feeding tube removed but it was 
town leaders didnt want their cozy ozarks community which 
promotes its fall apple butter makin days to become a news 
dateline about protests against stopping ms cruzans food and 
water but it did 
no one got what he or she wanted out of nancy cruzans sad saga 
joe cruzan did get a court decision allowing for the removal of 
his daughters feeding tube removed but he said after her funeral 
friday i would prefer to let my daughter die and let somebody 
else be this trailblazer our courage came from the young lady we 
just buried 
for him there will be no more onesided conversations with his 
33yearold daughter who died wednesday after spending nearly 
eight years in a vegetative state because of a devastating car 
crash 
he used to sit in ms cruzans quiet room at the missouri 
rehabilitation center here talking to her about legal action 
updating family news explaining why he wanted to help her life 
end 
encouragement came from supportive letters 
the letters have just been pouring in cruzan said the 
biggest part of the people support us im thankful and appreciate 
that 
now the cruzan family wants privacy and rest 
their home telephone number has been changed no longer will 
they make the drive from carterville to mount vernon that helped 
put 38000 miles on a 2yearold car cruzan says the vehicle is on 
its third tape deck so often have his daughters favorite songs 
been played during the drive 
to the ones who maybe didnt understand or didnt agree we 
did what we felt we had to do cruzan said we appreciate their 
prayers 
those who didnt agree converged on mount vernon as ms cruzan 
was dying they camped at the staterun hospital carrying signs 
urging the cruzans to reconnect the feeding tube some spent days 
in custody after trying to enter ms cruzans room identifying 
themselves only as nancy cruzan 
the demonstrators from wisconsin minnesota georgia and other 
states should have been run out of town on a rail said gene 
burk a barber for 24 years in mount vernon 
that family has gone through eight years of pure hell he 
said between haircuts friday at his shop near the county square 
it was a really sad situation i think the town is ready for it 
to be over 
opponents of removing ms cruzans food and water went to state 
and federal courts but failed in their efforts to reconnect it 
one warned that the state had slipped a big notch closer to 
hell because of the tubes removal 
kathy fairchild presidentelect of the mount vernon chamber of 
commerce was more immediately concerned about her towns image 
than missouris status in the hereafter 
editor of the weekly lawrence county record she was soliciting 
support friday for an advertisement commending efforts of the 
hospital whose 465person payroll makes it mount vernons largest 
employer 
the ad omits mention the cruzan case 
but sure thats the inspiration its disgusting to have all 
this attention and to have our friends and neighbors called 
murderers ms fairchild said friday 
its time to get back to normal its like our paper said in 
an editorial were ready to drop off the map

in the wake of nancy cruzans death 
combatants over the right to die are ready for fresh debate in the 
missouri legislature 
ms cruzan who died wednesday at age 33 had been hospitalized 
with no hope of recovery since a 1983 car wreck her parents tried 
since 1987 to have the womans lifesustaining feeding tube removed 
so she could die arguing they believed she would prefer not to 
live as she was 
finally after a legal fight that went to the us supreme 
court the family got what it sought a judge subsequently ruled 
that the family had presented clear and convincing evidence 
the standard set for missouri by the supreme court that ms 
cruzan would not want to live in a persistent vegetative state 
the years of litigation were prompted partly because ms cruzan 
left no written instructions about how to handle her incapacity 
with the cruzan case in mind state sen bob johnson is 
sponsoring a health care surrogate bill that he says would 
prevent others in missouri from having to face the same legal 
ordeal he failed in a bid to get similar legislation passed in the 
last session 
his bill would allow a person to sign legal documents 
designating one or more people family or friends to make any 
health care decision when the person becomes incapacitated their 
advance instructions could include approving withdrawal of food and 
water 
johnson said this would more than meet the legal standard of 
clear and convincing evidence 
if you sign this document theres no question that you 
wouldnt have to go through what the cruzans faced because it would 
be out of the court system he said 
missouri law currently has only the living will statute which 
allows a person to leave written instructions about medical care 
but it applies only when the person is in a terminal condition and 
specifically excludes withdrawal of food and water to a patient 
this is not a euthanasia bill this is not designed to induce 
the painless death of a person its to be used in cases where 
there is no chance of recovery johnson said recalling arguments 
against the measure 
johnsons bill in the last legislative session faced opposition 
led by the missouri catholic conference among others it was 
weakened over several weeks amid allegations that it authorized 
euthanasia 
finally with little of the measures original intent intact 
johnson spiked it for the year 
lou defeo the catholic conference lobbyist who organized 
opposition to johnsons bill said hell be back in 1991 to work 
against it 
the major defect is there are no safeguards for a vulnerable 
person and the persons most in need are the ones who will be the 
most vulnerable defeo says theres no balancing or protection 
by the family the surrogate could be a total stranger 
johnson said opponents were better organized than supporters of 
his measure but he promises that will change in the upcoming 
session 
among the supporters the missouri bar the organization for the 
states lawyers whose lobbyists have pledged to work the hallways 
along with senior citizens groups he said

the immigration and naturalization service 
plans to establish express lanes at certain border crossings to 
mexico and canada and charge for the expedited service 
according to ins spokesman verne jervis the agency will 
inaugurate the system sometime in 1991 expresslane locations and 
the amount of the fee have yet to be decided he said 
supporters of a bordercrossing toll say the ins proposal is a 
start but that the agency has room under legislation passed by 
congress this year to adopt a more ambitious fee program to pay for 
improved border security 
they have an opportunity for an aggressive intelligent 
program and the results could provide for a permanent effective 
financing vehicle for sound border security and theyre ducking 
for cover already said dan stein executive director of the 
federation for american immigration reform 
hispanic rights activists however questioned the precedent of 
establishing any fee even if optional for crossing the us 
border cecilia munoz of the national council of la raza expressed 
discomfort about paying to get into a country were living 
in an age when walls are coming down in other parts of the world 
and yet the united states is considering a fee for coming in 
and she questioned whether ins can handle another new program 
given its current management and financial woes the general 
accounting office in a recent draft report on the agency was 
harshly critical of the agencys administration and budget process 
jervis in an interview friday said that under the 
expresscrossing program users who pay the fee would be given a 
document or decal entitling them to quicker inspections the fees 
would be used solely to finance the program and would come on top 
of the bridge tolls already charged at some crossings 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the ins has 
critical shortages of inspector staff at the largest border 
crossings waits of several hours are not uncommon for travelers at 
some of the large land border crossings gao said 
in addition gao said ins faces a significant and unnecessary 
degree of potential fraud due to inadequate controls over nearly 
300 million in annual fee revenue 
jervis however said the agency would not be tackling a new 
program if we didnt think we could handle it 
ms munoz said a bordercrossing fee also has the potential of 
operating like a regressive tax hitting hardest those least able 
to afford the cost poorer residents of the southwest who travel 
frequently between the united states and mexico visiting relatives 
those who commute legally over the border or who have businesses 
in both countries 
but fair which proposed a bordercrossing fee two years ago 
said quicker inspections funded by a toll would be a boon to 
commerce in border communities 
the biggest detriment to transborder commerce is the two to 
threehour wait currently encountered in crossborder excursions 
stein said those who are crossing the border for legitimate 
reasons will be more than happy to pay for better and faster 
inspections time is money 
stein said a toll of 2 would increase the services budget by 
50 percent 
the additional money and manpower could also be used to help 
control drug smuggling and violence on the border stein said 
we want to get the border under control and this is a place to 
get the money stein said but im not sure the justice 
department has the political guts to do anything along these lines 
the administration of attorney general dick thornburgh has been 
characterized by an overriding desire to avoid controversy the 
ins is part of the justice department

dr james carroll witnessed the devastation 
wrought in kuwait by iraqi soldiers and recorded the events in a 
diary that he hoped would be delivered to his wife if he lost his 
life 
carroll a pediatric neurologist at the medical college of 
georgia delivered the diary to her in person after his dec 6 
release he was among hostages freed when iraqi president saddam 
hussein declared that all foreigners could leave the region 
the augusta chronicle published carrolls diary in sundays 
edition 
carroll was starting his third year working at kuwait university 
in kuwait city when iraq took over the country aug 2 
he spent the next four months first hiding among kuwaiti friends 
and then caring for the people remaining at the american embassy 
until they were freed 
he didnt believe he would make it out of the middle east alive 
and intended the diary be given to his wife shirley 
his account began the day of the invasion when a sudanese friend 
phoned to tell carroll doctor dont go outside there is 
war 
carroll continued to hide from iraqi soldiers because of 
saddams use of foreigners as human shields but he was able to 
describe the toll the invasion and occupation took on kuwait city 
day after day huge flatbed trucks go by the embassy with 
goods of all kinds he wrote on sept 1 the iraqis clear out 
entire apartment buildings by kicking in doors and evicting or 
capturing the occupants then they bring the trucks in and load 
everything they even remove the wiring 
carroll twice was invited to flee across the desert with 
friends some who said they had an escape route provided by the 
cia both times he declined citing the high risk both groups 
failed 
when saddam threatened to execute kuwaitis caught harboring 
foreigners carroll fled to the american embassy where a depleted 
staff was battling to stay open with phone lines cut and food and 
water deliveries stopped by the iraqis 
carroll described a hot boring routine of exercise digging a 
well eating canned tuna and standing guard duty 
there is no danger on guard duty we are here only to notify 
everyone if the iraqis decide to come in he wrote we have no 
way to stop them 
i am sitting here looking at the us flag flapping in the 
breeze this must be a real affront to the iraqis if they come in 
here i think war might be touched off probably they think the 
same 
carroll had no diplomatic passport and so was afraid to leave 
the embassy compound he left once to take to a hospital a woman 
who had broken her hip in a car accident while trying to flee 
across the desert 
somehow god got us through four iraqi checkpoints he 
wrote the soldiers requested the documents of the driver who 
had a diplomatic passport but never asked for mine 
he also wrote of being glad that his wife and seven children 
were safe the family was to have rejoined him in kuwait on aug 
24 
you and i are being tried in a most holy fire carroll wrote 
his wife 
carroll was allowed to leave kuwait on dec 9 but he didnt 
allow himself to believe the news until he landed in germany 
we were so out of practice in hearing good news that we didnt 
let ourselves get excited saddam had lied before and he would 
certainly do it again 
as he left the embassy carroll described what he saw kuwait 
had been transformed from a crowded metropolis to a deserted city 
with trash strewn through the streets 
carroll told the augusta newspaper he believes the strife is 
only beginning 
id like to go back at some point to help them rebuild the 
medical school he said but even if things clear up 
miraculously over there it wont be a safe place suitable for 
families for a number of years

nominated as his prime minister a littleknown businessman who 
promised to continue painful economic reforms aimed at achieving a 
market economy 
the selection of jan krzysztof bielecki 39 ended weeks of 
speculation about who would succeed prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki now serving in a caretaker capacity 
parliament was to consider the nomination on friday bielecki 
would serve until parliamentary elections which are to be held 
sometime next year 
bielecki a parliament deputy from gdansk and head of a 
consulting company was once part of the solidarity underground he 
is a leader of the liberaldemocratic congress a small political 
party devoted to development of private enterprise in poland 
the choice appeared aimed at underscoring walesas commitment to 
continuing the difficult transition to a market economy after four 
decades of communist rule the switchover has caused poles 
considerable economic hardship 
it the nomination should first of all be understood as the 
president treating economic problems as the most important the 
bearded graying bielecki told reporters after his nomination was 
announced 
he said he expected to announce his proposed cabinet within a 
few days combining people with a lot of experience with 
people as unknown as i am 
walesa spokesman andrzej drzycimski said talks on forming the 
new government would resume after the president and bielecki return 
to warsaw on wednesday following the new years holiday 
walesa as president is head of state and commander of the 
military the prime minister heads the government on a daytoday 
basis 
the selection of bielecki followed a few false starts defense 
lawyer jan olszewski withdrew from consideration for the prime 
ministers job dec 18 saying he and walesa disagreed over the 
makeup of the government 
leszek balcerowicz the finance minister was also a contender 
but he wanted to stay in his current post so he could concentrate 
on economic reform according to presidential spokesman andrzej 
drzycimski 
balcerowicz is the chief architect of the shock economic reforms 
now under way which bielecki said he would work to continue 
the reforms which took effect jan 1 call for largescale 
privatization and combined sharp rises in prices with an end of 
state subsidies on most goods 
mazowieckis announcement that he would quit as prime minister 
came one day after he was eliminated from the presidential race in 
nov 25 balloting finishing behind walesa and emigre businessman 
stanislaw tyminski walesa went on to beat tyminski in a runoff 
mazowiecki who differed with walesa over the pace of economic 
reform refused his former allys request that he stay on until the 
parliamentary elections 
parliament which is still dominated by former communists or 
their former allies elected in a partially rigged 1989 vote has 
said it will decide by march 1 when to dissolve 
vice adm piotr kolodziejcyzk said saturday he would remain as 
defense minister but interior minister krzysztof kozlowski in 
charge of police declined an offer to stay walesas spokesman 
said 
bielecki on dec 20 had denied rumors that he was to be prime 
minister telling the state pap news agency that he was not forming 
a government he was apparently tapped for the post after that

researcher in the field of management after the imposition of 
martial law in 1981 because of his participation in a protest at 
the lenin shipyard 
unemployed he earned a living as a truck driver hauling lumber 
while participating in the solidarity underground

iraqi leader saddam hussein is sending 
thousands more troops to bolster defenses on the border with turkey 
in the north a potential second front in a persian gulf war 
the iraqi buildup is believed to include at least eight 
divisions including two armored divisions or possibly more than 
100000 men asian diplomats in baghdad said saturday 
the diplomats said the troops backed by highquality t72 
battlefront tanks and supported by paramilitary militias are being 
deployed along the 435mile boundary to beef up defenses after 
turkey reinforced its army there 
iraqi media reported friday that up to 300000 paramilitary 
troops in the kurdish region have been reactivated as part of the 
plan to shore up iraqs northern defenses 
in early november the iraqis were reported to have only about 
40000 men along the turkish border 
although both sides have said they have no territorial ambitions 
against the other neither is taking chances turkey is a key ally 
of the united states in its faceoff against saddam 
turkish newspapers reported last week that the air force was 
deploying several squadrons of f4 f5 and f16 fighters in 
southeastern turkey and that 12500 paratroopers and infrantrymen 
would join an estimated 100000 troops already along the border 
turkey has also requested that nato send 42 jets for its defense 
against possible iraqi attack turkey wants the warplanes before 
jan 15 the un deadline for iraq to leave kuwait or face attack 
by a usled multinational force 
the us air force has several squadrons of longrange f111 
fighter bombers and f16 interceptors deployed at incirlik airbase 
in southern turkey 
and germany is considering sending air force planes and pilots 
to turkey on friday germany flew eight air force advisers there 
to look into preparations for basing a jet force there within 
weeks 
none of this is lost on saddam whose main force is concentrated 
along his southern border 
about 500000 iraqi troops are massed in southern iraq and 
kuwait facing a comparable number in the multinational force in 
saudi arabia and the gulf region 
one baghdad diplomat said that increasing turkish pressure on 
iraq could revive the old turkish dreams in northern iraqi 
provinces 
after the ottoman empire was divided up after world war i 
turkey had claims against the province of mosul and oilrich kirkuk 
similar to the claims of iraq on kuwait a large turkoman 
population is found in the northern provinces 
saddam also must keep an eye on turkeys southern neighbor 
syria which has joined the arab forces arrayed against iraq with 
19000 troops in saudi arabia 
president hafez assad is a bitter enemy of saddam who heads a 
rival wing of the arab baath socialist party assad has an active 
army of about 350000 troops at home and 40000 in lebanon 
soon after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait saddam made a dramatic 
move to secure his eastern front by making peace with iran giving 
in to tehrans demands for a permanent end to the 19801988 persian 
gulf war 
since the un security council voted on nov 29 to warn saddam 
he must leave kuwait by jan 15 or face possible military action 
saddam has called up reserves shifted commanders and moved 
divisions in ways that analysts say are clearly preparations for 
war 
last week iraqi interior minister samir mouhamad abdulwahab 
urged local chieftains in the kurdish region to help confront a 
possible military challenge in the north 
the kurdish chieftains who supported the government during 
iraqs battle against kurdish separatists in the 1980s were 
appointed as commanders of the national defense brigades which 
were defunct after baghdad reached a ceasefire with iran and 
crushed the rebellion 
analysts said they numbered about 300000

the cross were of forgiveness 
it is painful to be the victim said mormon bishop bruce 
johnson who presides over the congregation attended by kaye tiede 
and her husband rolf in humble texas a houston suburb 
but have you not learned how much more painful it is to be the 
offender johnson asked 
rolf tiede who was shot twice in the face when he arrived at 
the cabin later led about 30 family members into the chapel his 
face was bandaged in several places and part of his head had been 
shaved 
also in the family procession were tiedes daughters linae 20 
and tricia 16 who were kidnapped and briefly held hostage by the 
assailants 
summit county officers arrested von lester taylor 25 and 
edward steven deli 21 following a brief chase they have been 
charged with capital homicide aggravated burglary kidnapping 
arson and other felonies 
the two victims were eulogized by family and friends as model 
homemakers and parents 
mom and kaye were not only mother and daughter but were 
friends said sue ellen tidwell one of mrs potts three 
surviving daughters 
mrs potts had been left partly blind and infirm in an 
automobile accident that killed her second husband but remained 
the active matriarch of a family that included 19 grandchildren and 
six greatgrandchildren 
the rest of us well sometimes wed get short with mother 
since the accident but kaye would always point that out to 
us said miss tidwell

for all the other things in her life she never got to do said 
her son kenneth eugene tidwell 
he also said his older sister mrs tiede was a woman of 
exemplary faith

germany is considering sending air force 
planes and pilots to turkey in response to that nations request 
for nato help in bolstering its defenses against iraq 
on friday the government flew eight air force advisers to 
turkey to check what preparations are necessary to base a 42jet 
force there within weeks the unit is made up of 18 german 18 
belgian and six italian air force jets 
the development comes as germany is under international scrutiny 
because of a limited contribution to the antiiraq coalition in the 
persian gulf region and exports to iraq before a un embargo was 
imposed 
turkey has requested deployment of the air unit by jan 15 the 
un deadline for baghdad to pull out of kuwait or face attack by a 
usdominated multinational force 
chancellor helmut kohls government says germany is not 
considering a deployment of ground troops in turkey the only 
country neighboring iraq that is a member of the north atlantic 
treaty organization a western military alliance 
ground forces are absolutely not under discussion said 
government spokesman dieter vogel 
iraqi media has reported that baghdad has reactivated up to 
300000 paramilitary troops to shore up defenses on the countrys 
northern border with turkey a possible second front if war breaks 
out between iraqi troops and the antiiraqi multinational force in 
saudi arabia 
some germans worry that sending a handful of air force pilots to 
turkey could lead to a larger german commitment 
germanys opposition social democrats have demanded kohl turn 
down the turkish request 
hansjochen vogel national leader of the social democrats 
instead demanded that kohls government launch an initiative to 
seek a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
hanschristian stroeble and renate dumas leaders of the leftist 
greens party called on german troops to desert rather than face 
fighting iraq through deployment in turkey 
when tensions arose over iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
germany avoided joining the antiiraq military deployment by saying 
that sending troops to nonnato turf would be a constitutional 
violation 
instead germany agreed to help finance the efforts to isolate 
iraq and to provide military equipment and logistical help in 
moving supplies to the gulf the total value of the promised 
assistance amounts to about 22 billion 
nonetheless criticism persists in washington that germany has 
done too little to support the gulf cause 
germany has come under even closer scrutiny in the past two 
weeks because of allegations that german firms had helped iraq 
advance its atomic technology at least 100 german firms are 
suspected of helping iraq develop its unconventional weapons 
capabilities 
there have been reports that iraq is anywhere from 2 to 10 years 
from being able to construct an atomic bomb 
nato is expected to decide in early january whether to grant the 
turkish request kohls government has not clearly stated its 
position on the matter 
but opposing a nato decision to send the mobile force to turkey 
would raise severe doubts about germanys loyalty to the alliance 
kohls governing party the christian democratic union leans 
toward showing greater solidarity with washingtons gulf policies 
hans stercken chairman of parliaments foreign affairs 
committee and a prominent christian democrat said all efforts must 
be made to resolve the gulf crisis without a war 
but he said germanys armed forces and all other members of 
the north atlantic alliance would be obliged to repel an 
attack on an alliance member such as turkey

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday ordered 
the creation of a development fund and a 5 percent national sales 
tax whose revenues would partly go to helping the poor and 
stabilizing the ruble 
under powers granted him earlier this year by the national 
supreme soviet legislature gorbachev can order emergency decrees 
to carry out his plan to create a market economy 
the latest decrees were not connected to the soviet parliament 
vote thursday that strengthened gorbachevs power over a 
reorganized executive branch that vote has brought accusations the 
soviet union was moving toward a dictatorship 
a gorbachev aide was quoted saturday as saying public debate and 
scrutiny by the media and democratically elected lawmakers will 
ensure the president does not abuse his strong new powers 
the presidents every move and word are discussed by the 
people and the press in an ever more open manner so we have got 
the main remedy against dictatorship georgy shakhnazarov told 
rabochaya tribuna or workers tribune newspaper 
the decrees announced saturday appeared to show a sensitivity on 
gorbachevs part to the 15 republics demands for more autonomy 
from the federal government 
under the sales tax decree 70 percent of the proceeds would go 
to the republics with the remainder for the federal government 
the state news agency tass said no such sales tax has existed in 
the soviet union for years 
the purpose is to provide financial resources for the 
implementation of socioeconomic programs adopted by the soviet 
parliament and the parliaments of the union republics to support 
the section of the population in the low income bracket and to 
stabilize the monetary system tass reported 
the tax would be imposed on sales of production and 
technological commodities consumer goods work and paid 
services tass reported it did not say when the tax would take 
effect 
there was no way immediately to determine how much revenue the 
tax would generate 
it would raise the 3ruble price of a pack of soviet cigarettes 
for example by 15 kopeks a kopek is a hundredth of a ruble the 
average soviet monthly wage is only 257 rubles 411 at the 
official exchange rate 
the division of revenues among national and republic governments 
became a heated issue last week when the russian parliament voted 
to slash its contribution to the national government by roughly 85 
percent next year 
gorbachev had said the move could cripple the government and had 
pleaded with russia to reverse the decision 
another of saturdays decrees created a vaguely defined 
nonbudget stabilization fund to be created from sales of 
state property and from existing taxes and other payments tass 
said 
it was created with the goal of providing a normal functioning 
of the countrys economy of financial investments of scientific 
research and of other programs in the interest of all republics 
and also for the support of companies that experience hardships 
outside their own control during the transition to a market 
economy tass reported 
the decree recommended that republics create analogous 
funds that could be consolidated into a single account before the 
signing of proposed economic agreements between the republics and 
the kremlin 
shakhnazarov in the newspaper interview said the powers 
granted gorbachev on thursday would not allow him to interfere in 
areas under the republics jurisdiction 
if he oversteps the boundaries of his authority republics 
will be able to appeal against his actions he said he did not 
explain how this would work 
late friday a group of reformist lawmakers issued a statement 
warning the soviet union is heading toward dictatorship where the 
key role is assigned to repressive bodies and violence could become 
the major means of solving internal political issues 
shakhnazarov said comparison of gorbachevs powers to those of 
former soviet leaders leonid brezhnev or josef stalin were 
stupid 
we had none of the legislative structures we have now under 
stalin or under brezhnev he said

panama may ask the united states to extradite 
manuel antonio noriega to face possible charges in a second murder 
case the head of panamas supreme court said 
also friday the united states signed an agreement with the 
government of president guillermo endara to help train the 
fledgling police force which replaced noriegas defense forces 
that were defeated in the us invasion a year ago 
court president carlos lucas lopez said friday that noriega in 
a florida prison awaiting trial on drugtrafficking charges is 
suspected of involvement in the 1985 death of huga spadafora 
panamas attorney general earlier asked the foreign ministry to 
request noriegas extradition to face charges in a homicide case 
involving maj moises giroldi who attempted a coup against gen 
noriegas rule in october 1989 
the judge said the court has decided to hear charges against 
noriega in the spadafora case and could solicit noriegas 
extradition from the united states 
spadafora fought with the leftist sandinistas against 
nicaraguas anastasio somoza regime of the 1970s and was later a 
critic of noriega in panama 
he was killed and decapitated along the panamacosta rica 
border his attackers were never caught 
thenpresident nicolas ardito barletta in 1985 refused to open 
an inquiry into the case after the military under noriega opposed 
it 
the court said it was also opening investigations into the 
deaths of carlos efrain guzman baules killed in an antinoriega 
demonstration of marcos alberto rodriguez justine grandson of a 
former noriega aide and of carlos rodriguez justine grandson of 
former col marcos justine a noriega ally rodriguez was killed 
this year 
panama filed a 65 billion damage suit against noriega in us 
district court in october claiming he took part in assassination 
torture drug trafficking money laundering embezzlement sale of 
visas and passports and other abuses while chief of panamas 
defense forces 
the united states and panama signed an accord friday providing 
us training and support for panamas struggling new civilian 
police force no cost was given for the program 
vice president ricardo arias calderon said the pact aims at 
establishing a civilian police force with a high level of 
professionalism that respects human rights and helps 
institutionalize panamanian democracy 
he and us training program director patrick long signed the 
accord at a ceremony attended by us ambassador deane hinton 
panama replaced noriegas military police with a civilian law 
enforcement agency after noriegas ouster 
the accord allows the us international criminal investigation 
and training assistance program to design police academies provide 
police training and funnel equipment into programs a us embassy 
communique said 
us police and army reservists have tried to help panama 
convert its corrupt 20yearold military police system into an 
effective civilian one but many members are military men still 
loyal to noriega 
bank robberies store holdups and prisoner escapes plague the 
nation 
the new 13000member agency has half the budget of its 
16000member predecessor the defense forces 
early this month officers led by an escaped senior police chief 
took over the police headquarters for several hours protesting 
their treatment by the government they surrendered to us and 
loyal panamanian forces

a 32 million judgment against a shipping company 
has done little to improve pay for foreign sailors whose 
substandard wages are hidden by false bookkeeping attorneys and 
industry chaplains said 
the penalty against delicia shipping co was handed down in 
august by us district judge jack tanner in tacoma tanner found 
the company intentionally underpaid 21 filipino seamen who had 
signed shipping articles promising higher wages under the worldwide 
international transport workers federation collective agreement 
the decision hailed as a victory for seamen has become buried 
in months of legal motions petitions and appeals 
richard dodson a baton rouge la attorney for the seamen 
said none has seen a dollar from the case and more than half have 
been blacklisted in the industry and cant get work 
dodson said the case was pending before the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals in san francisco with several more motions and 
hearings possible 
if finally the seafarers win the case then i think its going 
to have a very serious impact on the practice of double 
bookkeeping because most ship owners are just not going to be able 
to afford that kind of penalty said paul chapman of the new 
yorkbased seamens church institute 
double bookkeeping refers to the practice of keeping two sets of 
financial records one is shown to inport union inspectors to 
indicate that sailors are being paid the negotiated standard 
wages the other shows their actual pay sometimes as little as 
onefifth of the first figure 
us law gives federal courts jurisdiction over wage cases 
involving foreign vessels and crews when their voyages end in us 
waters 
the delicia case involved the pine forest a ship flying the 
flag of the south pacific republic of vanuatu which requires that 
sailors sign shipping articles promising the high union wages the 
sailors did not get that pay but each month were required to sign 
a voucher showing they had received it and sign a separate receipt 
for their actual wages tanner found 
chapman said double bookkeeping remained widespread in the 
shipping industry after the decision he said filipino sailors are 
paid as little as 275 a month 
the practice was defended by joseph stacey an attorney for 
delicia part of inui steamship co of japan 
once the filipino seaman is paid as much as the japanese 
seamen they will just use japanese sailors he said 
low wags reflect the realities of the market stacey said 
most filipino seamen are eager to work for the lower wage and 
some resisted the lawsuit brought by their coworkers he asserted 
seamens chaplains said the sailors are afraid to complain even 
through they often are underfed and denied medical attention and 
pay 
they really have to be desperate before they speak they all 
know they would be out of work said the rev norris stoa of the 
seattle seamens center 
the rev john moes of the seamans center christian in seattle 
said he was glad the pine forest case focused attention on double 
bookkeeping 
he asserted that on many other ships sailors work under 
similar conditions but they live in such fear to do anything 
no one at several seamens centers in seattle and tacoma could 
produce a filipino seaman willing to talk about shipboard 
conditions 
of the 21 pine forest defendants 13 have been blacklisted in 
the philippines and cannot get shipping jobs dodson said 
the other eight defendants did not appear in court and continued 
to work on the ship while their filipino union represented them he 
said 
dodson who specializes in maritime law and has worked with the 
seamens church institute said he will represent sailors from the 
fir grove cargo ship against inui next july in a case identical to 
the pine forests 
as long as shipping competition remains intense companies will 
look for methods such as double bookkeeping to hold down costs he 
said 
the vessels cost the same finances fuel and food are the 
same the only place you can possibly save money is in wages to the 
crew so if you want to gain some advantage you engage in some 
nefarious activity such as double bookkeeping dodson said

salvadoran guerrillas have 
announced an end to their sixweek military offensive and declared 
themselves ready for new peace talks to end their 11yearold war 
against the government 
in a broadcast late friday by the clandestine rebel radio the 
general command of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
said its ceasefire would take effect monday morning 
the rebels said they were prepared to resume peace talks aimed 
at ending the civil war that has claimed more than 73000 lives and 
made a shambles of the economy in el salvador this central 
american country of 5 million people 
the guerrillas promised to bring new proposals to their next 
meeting with the government and if it abandons its intransigent 
positions we could reach an agreement rapidly 
there was no immediate comment from the government 
the guerrillas claimed their military campaign begun nov 20 
had caused 1190 army casualties including dead and wounded 
official statistics put the toll at more than 600 dead and 1000 
wounded including soldiers guerrillas and civilians 
early this month the rebels for the first time shot down two 
government planes with surfacetoair missiles the attacks alarmed 
the salvadoran government which relies heavily on the air force to 
keep the rebels from launching fullscale assaults 
the state department also worried announced dec 7 it was 
speeding delivery of 481 million in military aid to the 
government those funds included 106 million from 1990 and 375 
million from the 1991 account 
congress in october halved the 85 million in military aid 
previously allotted for fiscal 1991 saying the salvadoran 
government was too slow in prosecuting human rights abusers in the 
military 
the promise of a truce if carried out would belie a us state 
department claim last week that the rebels planned major military 
attacks early in the year 
negotiation is the rational way to solve the conflict the 
guerrilla announcement said nevertheless arena and the armed 
forces oppose a peaceful solution with the argument that the 
purification of the army is an obstacle 
arena is the spanish acronym for the nationalist republican 
alliance the elected rightwing governing party 
unbrokered negotiations have stalled over the guerrillas 
demand for major reductions in the size of the armed forces and 
removal of officers implicated in human rights abuses the army has 
resisted such moves

plo leaders said saturday that israeli and 
palestinian officials have met and discussed giving autonomy to the 
occupied gaza strip in exchange for palestinian concessions in the 
persian gulf crisis 
a senior official of the palestine liberation organization said 
a meeting took place last week in paris he said the plo rejects 
the proposal though some individual palestinian leaders may 
consider it 
the plan aims at providing the plo with imaginary promises and 
illusions in order to cause splits in the unified palestinian 
position over its support for iraq he said speaking on 
condition he not be identified 
reports on the meeting were confirmed by officials from the 
plos mainstream fatah faction the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine and the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine 
a saudi businessman israeli labor party leader shimon peres and 
other israelis met with a palestinian personality and 
representatives of some arab states and discussed the possibility 
of granting gaza strip to the palestinians to exercise 
selfautonomy there according to abdulrahim mallouh politburo 
member of the damascusbased popular front for the liberation of 
palestine 
mallouh whose faction is the second largest within the plo 
said a final agreement was being proposed only after the plo 
offers some concessions including withholding support from iraq 
and dropping the linkage between the palestinian problem and iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait 
the paris meeting was one of the americanisraeli plots to 
implant a split within plo ranks he said once this happens 
they hope to strip iraq of its main ally and of its claims to 
secure a link between all regional problems 
mallouh said that according to the plan israeli housing 
minister ariel sharon would coordinate with israeli leftwing 
leader shimon peres on forming a new coalition government that 
would take steps to implement this scheme 
there was no israeli comment on the reported talks 
the gaza strip home to more than 800000 palestinians was 
captured from egypt during the 1967 arabisraeli war 
arabs have rejected a previous israeli plan to grant selfrule 
to palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
they have called for an israeli withdrawal from those lands and the 
formation of a palestinian state after talks under the aegis of the 
united nations 
israeli leaders have rejected a binding international peace 
conference on the middle east prime minister yitzhak shamir has 
recently suggested he would keep the territories under israeli 
rule

vice president dan quayle left saturday night 
for a quick trip to saudi arabia to spend new years day with 
american troops and visit saudi leaders and the exiled emir of 
kuwait 
the vice president and his party took off at 745 pm est from 
andrews air force base outside the nations capital 
the trip comes just two weeks before the united nationsimposed 
deadline of jan 15 for iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw 
his army from kuwait 
quayles itinerary included a dinner sunday night with saudi 
crown prince abdullah and a meeting with king fahd to discuss the 
state of the usled military buildup in the gulf region 
after spending the night in riyadh quayle and his entourage 
will spend monday and tuesday visiting troops and sailors deployed 
in saudi arabia 
new years day also will include a side trip to taif where 
exiled kuwaiti emir jaber alsabah will receive the vice president 
quayle will return to washington in the predawn hours on 
wednesday 
administration officials said the visit primarily is intended as 
a morale builder for the troops as tensions mount over whether and 
when armed conflict will break out with iraq 
among the more than 400000 troops president bush has ordered to 
the gulf are many who serve as quayle did in the national guard 
quayles military background has caused him some controversy 
when bush selected him as his vice presidential running mate in 
1988 allegations arose that quayles family had pulled strings to 
get him into the indiana national guard in 1969 so he would not 
have to be drafted and sent to vietnam 
quayle has said he is proud of his guard service and took that 
route so he could finish law school while fulfilling his military 
obligation 
quayles staff said there were no plans for him to carry a new 
diplomatic initiative on the gulf standoff and that his meetings 
with fahd and the emir were of consultative nature 
his visit comes as baghdad and washington remain stalemated over 
a date for saddam to meet with secretary of state james a baker 
iii for talks on the crisis

president bushs resoluteness in foreign affairs 
in contrast to his wavering and confusion over domestic 
policies made him time magazines twofaced man of the year in 
1990 
time said saturday that the two sides of president bush will 
be presented in the cover story of its jan 7 issue which hits 
newsstands monday 
one is a leader whose foreign policy during the year was a 
study in resoluteness and mastery the magazine said saturday 
the other is a leader whose domestic track record was just as 
strongly marked by wavering and confusion 
we did something a little unusual this year a little 
unorthodox time managing editor henry muller said at a news 
conference 
the magazine said bush raised a vision of a new world order 
by taking the lead in a united nations embargo against iraq and a 
military buildup in the persian gulf after iraqs invasion and 
annexation of kuwait in early august 
but domestically bush left things alone until he could no 
longer avoid taking action time said 
global diplomacy is what he has trained for and what absorbs 
him domestic affairs are just not as much fun time said 
bush narrowly defeated iraqi president saddam hussein for the 
man of the year title muller said 
why didnt we pick saddam the answer in the end really is 
that invading a little country is not enough to make you man of the 
year muller said 
others cited as some of the years most important newsmakers 
were south african black nationalist leader nelson mandela german 
chancellor helmut kohl and boris yeltsin president of the russian 
republic 
every president since franklin d roosevelt has been selected by 
the magazine as its man of the year

the national assembly confirmed the 
armys choice for president saturday without a vote and some 
members stormed out of the chamber in protest 
the new president was sworn in five days after the military 
threw out president ramsewak shankar in a bloodless coup and 
pledged to install a nonpolitical interim cabinet and organize 
a popular vote 
shankar had been locked in a bitter dispute with former army 
commander cmdr desi bouterse who ruled suriname as dictator from 
19801988 
the main purpose of the new government will be to organize 
elections within 100 days according to the military 
the new president johan kraag in his late 70s belongs to the 
national party of suriname ousted vice president henck arron is a 
member of the same party 
jules wijdenbosch was also sworn in as the new vice president 
he is a former prime minister who organized surinames last popular 
elections in 1987 which shankar won wijdenbosch is chairman of 
the national democratic party which was organized by bouterse 
one national assembly member arti jesurun vice president of 
the national party of suriname said on surinamese radio there had 
been an agreement for a secret ballot but the rules were reversed 
saturday 
as far as i am concerned the national assembly approved the 
new president and vice president with bowed heads jesurun said 
national assembly chairman jaggernath lathmon said that under 
surinamese tradition no vote was necessary because there was only 
one candidate for each office he declared the nominees to be 
unanimously approved without a vote 
several of the 51 members at the session stormed out of the 
chamber leaving 34 members on the assembly floor had a vote taken 
place at least twothirds 34 votes were needed for approval 
shankar and his cabinet formally submitted their resignations to 
the national assembly on thursday the military claims that 
surinames constitution permits military intervention as long as 
the national assembly is left intact 
this ethnically diverse nation of 400000 people on the 
northeast coast of south america has suffered progressive economic 
decline since 1980 the year that bouterse rose to power in a coup 
shankars overthrow coincided with growing popular discontent 
with his governments inability to revive the economy of this 
former dutch colony beset by high inflation and unemployment the 
government has a monthly trade deficit of 10 million 
bouterse stepped down as army chief just hours before the latest 
coup in the culmination of a longrunning dispute with shankar he 
is widely believed to have planned the coup 
in washington the organization of american states on friday 
denounced the military takeover the united states joined in the 
protest 
domestic opposition to the takeover has been muted although the 
daily de ware tyd on friday accused the army of imposing its will 
on the government 
bouterse still remains the most powerful army figure in the 
country as chairman the military authority which supervised the 
armed forces he resigned as army chief but that resignation is 
expected to be reviewed by the new government the army has stated

an attitude adjustment is more important in 
preventing disease than changes in diet and exercise habits the 
american institute for preventive medicine says in its new years 
resolutions list 
the no 1 entry on the institutes sixth annual top ten 
healthiest resolutions list is to avoid psychosclerosis a 
hardening of the attitudes dr don powell president of the 
institute said friday 
its the way we view the events in life he said we used 
to think physical fitness was from the neck down but now we see it 
as more of an integration of mind and body 
powell author of 365 health hints said working out at the 
gym isnt enough for people who want to live longer healthier 
lives 
you have to look at their attitude the way they deal with 
stress whether they have a social support network and the way 
they view life he said 
adopting the resolutions on the list which is based on recent 
medical research could add up to 20 years to a persons life 
powell said 
the list includes traditional goodhealth commandments like 
watch weight reduce cholesterol get physical control blood 
pressure limit alcohol and use seat belts it also includes 
resolutions to control hostility and develop a social support 
network 
stop smoking appears on the 1991 list as it has each year since 
1985 but this years list includes a resolution to avoid smokers 
to escape the potentially harmful effects of passive smoke outlined 
in a recent us surgeon generals report 
thomas lauria spokesman for the washingtonbased tobacco 
institute said that that resolution suggests segregating 30 
percent of the population and would foster unnecessary ill will 
were seeing a 90s version of the new segregationist 
lauria said imagine if you put any other group in that category 
like dont associate with catholics can you imagine the outbreak 
that would cause 
resolutions to get at least seven hours of sleep each night was 
bumped off the list for 1991 to make room for the attitude 
adjustment priority 
other past resolutions include seeking the medicinal values of 
laughter avoiding loneliness and practicing safe sex 
thats not to say safe sex isnt a critical issue in our time 
too but the mental health issues take precedent powell said

anatoly karpov kept his hopes alive for a 
5050 cut of the 3 million world chess championship prize money 
saturday by defeating garry kasparov who has already won the 
title in the 23rd game of their match 
karpov playing white forced his fellow soviet grandmaster to 
withdraw in the 29th move after 3 hours 50 minutes of play that 
narrowed kasparovs lead in their series to 1211 
the pair play their 24th and final game monday 
kasparov who needed only 12 points to keep his title 
successfully defended it for the third time wednesday by drawing 
with karpov the 05 points awarded for the draw brought kasparovs 
point total to 12 against 10 for karpov 
but karpovs victory saturday night brought the score to 1211 
and the final game is vital for both men in terms of dividing up 
the prize money 
if karpov wins the last match he assures himself of an equal 
15million share with his rival if he loses or draws he will 
have to settle for a 13 million share while kasparov pockets

gov mario cuomo who had scrapped plans for 
a fancy inauguration because of his states tight budget says he 
now plans a modest swearingin ceremony 
it wont be a big public ceremony said the democrat 
governor who begins his third fouryear term on new years day 
last month cuomo canceled plans for a traditional public 
inauguration a move he estimated would save the state about 
70000 and planned a private inauguration instead 
cuomo changed his mind last week saying an inaugural ceremony 
is a nice tradition although not legally necessary since he was 
continuing in office 
cuomo and lt gov stan lundine will be sworn in monday 
afternoon at the new york court of appeals building by chief judge 
sol wachtler and the ceremony will cost nothing the governor 
said 
earlier this month cuomo and the state legislature approved a 
package of spending cuts to help eliminate a projected 1 billion 
deficit the governor also is laying off 2000 state workers by the 
end of the fiscal year on march 31 
when he announced he was canceling the traditional inauguration 
cuomo said he wanted to avoid the expense it would necessarily 
entail 
past inaugural ceremonies included rousing gospel choirs and 
indian chiefs in traditional dress

iraqi opposition factions say they want 
to overthrow president saddam hussein and form a transitional 
government to hold free elections and establish a democracy 
newspapers reported saturday 
the conservative alanwar and prosyrian ashsharq dailies 
published a statement by 15 oppositon groups saying the 
transitional government should be set up in baghdad once saddam has 
been toppled 
it also said the state of emergency should be abolished a 
general amnesty should be declared for all saddams opponents and 
human rights should be guaranteed 
the dissident groups have been meeting in damascus capital of 
syria 
the syrians are saddams archrivals in the arab world they have 
sent about 19000 troops to join the usdominated multinational 
force opposing iraq 
the crisis has accelerated moves by the disparate and often 
fractious iraqi opposition groups to unite and exploit saddams 
international isolation 
they have been seriously weakened by saddams ruthless 
elimination of opponents his pervasive security apparatus and 
their own divisions all the groups are banned in iraq 
in recent months they have made more determined moves to 
present a viable alternative to saddams oneman rule through the 
baath socialist party 
but analysts do not believe the dissident factions pose a 
significant threat to saddam even in the dire straits he now finds 
himself most analysts believe that the iraqi army is the only 
organization capable of toppling him 
the opposition groups in damascus included the iranianbacked 
shiite moslem addawa islami movement or islamic call which has 
waged a bloody terrorist campaign against baghdad for more than a 
decade other groups taking part were a splinter baath faction the 
independent arab nationalists the patriotic union of kurdistan led 
by veteran guerrilla jalal talabani and other kurdish factions 
the kurdish groups which have a history of feuding among 
themselves have been fighting the baghdad government off and on 
for decades seeking an independent kurdish homeland there are 
about 35 million kurds in iraqs 17 million population

exchange for assurances that it will not be attacked by the 
usled multinational force which is expected to total more than 
half a million troops by the end of january 
these are ridiculous ideas and figments of the imagination 
jassim was quoted as saying 
independent radio monte carlo which has an arabiclanguage 
service widely listened to in the middle east is generally 
reliable in its reporting on the persian gulf situation 
a statement later saturday by iraqs ruling revolutionary 
command council called the report a sick interpretation that 
exists only in the minds of the planners of evil and their suspect 
circles 
us officials have also denied that secret talks are being 
held 
iraqi president saddam hussein has sent an estimated 500000 
troops to southern iraq and kuwait since he seized the emirate on 
aug 2 in a dispute over oil land and money 
the statement by his ruling council reaffirmed iraqs 
determination to hold on to the conquered emiate despite the un 
deadline to pullout by jan 15 or face possible attack 
a political activist in jordan said saturday that saddam has 
messaged king fahd of saudi arabia warning that his country will be 
iraqs second target after israel if saudi leaders continue to push 
for war 
azmi khawaja leader of the marxist popular jordanian democratic 
unity party said saddam spoke to him of the letter during a 
90minute meeting in baghdad this week 
last week saddam threatened to attack israel in the event of 
war 
aziz took a hard line in his discussions with yugoslav foreign 
minister budimir loncar who was in baghdad on behalf of the 
102nation nonaligned movement which yugoslavia leads 
iraqs state news agency reported that aziz repeated iraqi 
demands to link a pullout of kuwait with a resolution of the 
arabisraeli dispute the united states has repeatedly rejected 
attempts to link the two issues demanding saddams unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait 
details of loncars initiative were not given previous attempts 
at mediation have failed but loncars new initiative had at least 
one difference both iraq and kuwait belong to the nonaligned 
movement which rejects any formal military alliances with east or 
west 
loncar was to meet sunday with saddam last month he visited 
iran the united arab emirates syria and jordan for talks on the 
crisis 
aziz told reporters there had been no breakthrough in the 
stalemate over fixing a date for direct usiraqi talks iraq had 
invited secretary of state james a baker iii to visit on jan 12 
but the bush administration says that is too close to the jan 15 
deadline washington has said any bakersaddam meeting must take 
place before thursday 
in other developments 
iraqi media reported that up to 300000 paramilitary troops in 
the kurdish region have been reactivated to shore up the countrys 
northern border with turkey part of the antiiraq coalition 
the iraqi buildup at the turkish border is believed to include 
at least eight divisions including two armored divisions or 
possibly more than 100000 men asian diplomats in baghdad said 
saturday 
turkey has requested nato send 42 jetfighters as a deterrent 
against iraq and germany is considering taking part in the force 
in bonn germany foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
proposed that his european community colleagues convene a special 
meeting next week to discuss the gulf crisis german radio reported 
saturday westdeutscher rundfunk radio said genscher has suggested 
the meeting occur on jan 4 
further details were not immediately available 
an air force weather forecaster said the us military isnt 
getting important data collected by saudi arabia even as winter 
sandstorms and choppy seas pose new obstacles for usled forces 
the forecaster capt judy dickey said that although the 
kingdom does supply some information it does not share data on 
wind speed and direction fearing that teletype reports would aid 
iraq in launching a chemical or biological attack 
american medical experts say a us plan to inoculate troops in 
the gulf against germ warfare agents could not possibly protect 
servicemen against all of the hundreds of microbes that could be 
used in a biological attack 
dr bradley sack a johns hopkins university expert on 
infectious diseases said the troops would have to be vaccinated 
weeks or even months in advance for sufficient protection against 
disease 
in toulon french chief of staff gen maurice schmitt said 
saturday that his countrys soldiers in the gulf or en route have 
been vaccinated for contagious diseases like typhus and cholera

a 20year transit veteran who operated a boston trolley that 
crashed into another rail car had an alcohol level above the 
massachusetts drunken driving limit transit officials said 
saturday 
investigators worked into the weekend to learn the circumstances 
of the boston accident which injured 33 people and a new york 
subway fire which injured 150 and claimed a second life saturday 
both occurred underground friday morning 
new york mayor david dinkins said he expected city workers to 
have a report on his desk by monday afternoon he ordered the 
review amid charges that mistakes and confusion hampered rescue 
operations 
questions also arose about whether huge ventilation fans in the 
brooklyn subway tunnel that were out of order could have drawn away 
smoke from the electrical fire 
in boston federal safety officials began inspecting the 
trolleys involved massachusetts bay transportation authority 
officials said the brakes and signals functioned properly but the 
operator said he had trouble braking 
there is no indication that we know of at this time that 
alcohol was used on the job said peter dimond an mbta 
spokesman he said officials believe the operator drank before 
starting his shift 
dimond said he could not release the exact alcohol test results 
for the 64yearold mbta worker but said the operator exceeded the 
states blood alcohol drunken driving limit which is 10 percent 
the driver whose name was not released has been suspended without 
pay 
the driver was on the return leg of his first trip at 634 am 
when the car he was steering crashed into the rear of another green 
line trolley at arlington station in the citys downtown district 
transit officials were trying to determine whether the operator 
involved in the crash was the one a passenger had called to 
complain about just a half hour earlier 
we got a message that there was abusive language that the 
driver was not behaving properly but there was no indication that 
there was a safety risk dimond said 
the boston herald reported that tony niederberger of watertown 
telephoned mbta police and told a fare collector that a driver was 
cursing and had sped through a curve knocking passengers from 
their seats 
the mbta promised a prompt public hearing 
we want to be fair to the operator we want to be fair to the 
traveling public as well dimond said 
the new york review will include recommendations on preventing 
further accidents and ensuring rescue efforts are performed in a 
timely and coordinated fashion dinkins said 
fire and transit authorities blamed melting slush for 
shortcircuiting a transformer which exploded and caused a smoky 
fire that stopped a manhattanbound train 
passenger peter hagen 35 of smithtown ny apparently 
suffered a heart attack and was pronounced dead friday on arrival 
at long island college hospital in brooklyn 
another rider dorene blumenthal 37 of massapequa park ny

two former dictators who led the 
1970s dirty war against a leftist insurgency and a rebel leader 
whose movement inspired the repression were freed saturday by 
government pardons 
the onetime dictators former army gens jorge videla and 
roberto viola and montonero guerrilla founder mario eduardo 
firmenich walked free for the first time since 1984 
videla and viola were among 11 former officials mostly generals 
convicted of torture and other rights abuses who were pardoned 
under an order announced thursday by president carlos menem 
menem who last year freed 39 other generals and 64 terrorists 
said saturdays releases would definitely close a sad and black 
stage of argentine history 
the pardons however will reopen wounds for many argentines 
recent polls have shown up to 80 percent of the population opposed 
freeing the men who symbolized a painful period in which thousands 
were spirited away by men in civilian clothing and never seen 
again 
the army said its unconventional war in the late 1970s and early 
1980s was the only kind possible to fight leftist insurgents human 
rights groups say up to 30000 people died in a campaign of 
genocide 
this is a very sad day for argentina said former president 
raul alfonsin who pushed forward the bitter trials of the military 
regime after being elected in 1983 menem succeeded him last year 
politicians clergy and human rights activists planned to 
demonstrate sunday across this south american nation of 31 million 
people 
the others freed by menems announcement included dismissed 
admiral emilio massera and former army chief of staff carlos suarez 
mason who was extradited from the united states in 1988 for a 
trial that never was held 
argentinas war began in the early 1970s when leftists trying 
to topple the government unleashed a wave of assassinations 
bombings bank robberies and kidnappings for ransom 
firmenich boldly announced the existence of the montoneros in 
june 1970 by kidnapping and executing former military president 
pedro aramburu 
growing unrest led videla and viola to stage the march 1976 coup 
that overthrew president isabel peron videla became president 
until 1981 when viola took over for a year 
the military stepped down in december 1983 after its disastrous 
defeat in the falklands war with britain 
officials have documented the disappearance of at least 8960 
people in the years after the 1976 coup all are presumed to have 
been kidnapped and executed by the military 
according to testimony in the trials the military burned the 
bodies of some its victims buried others in unmarked graves and 
tossed some from helicopters into the sea thousands of argentine 
families spent years trying to find out what happened to loved 
ones some still dont know 
adolfo perez esquivel winner of the 1980 nobel peace prize 
said the pardons signify the consecration of impunity for the 
authors of grave crimes against humanity 
menem a former governor jailed for nearly five years by videla 
said he was ready to surrender the past and so should his 
countrymen in the interest of national reconciliation and political 
stability 
the pending trials of dirty war officers sparked three army 
insurrections in recent years and the imprisonment of videla and 
the others was the justification for a fourth uprising on dec 3 
the government news agency telam said videla viola massera and 
retired gen pablo riccheri were released from magdalena military 
prison 62 miles south of buenos aires and taken away in a 
helicopter 
firmenich was met outside devoto prison in buenos aires by his 
lawyer and family and whisked away by car 
suarez mason and dismissed general ramon camps were released 
from a military hospital in the capital telam reported 
the others who received pardons including former economy 
minister jose martinez de hoz already had been freed two of the 
former officials norma kennedy and duilio brunello served prison 
terms for fraud charges unrelated to the dirty war 
the pardon cleared a total of 12 men and women of pending 
charges officials said but since the decree has not been 
published it wasnt known if it permits those pardoned to hold 
public office again

cashstrapped cuba signed a new economic aid 
pact with the soviet union on saturday cubas official news agency 
said soviet exports would be adjusted but it gave no figures 
soviet officials have warned that the crisis in their own 
country would mean significant cuts in aid to cuba whose hardline 
communist government is increasingly at odds with the changing 
soviet union 
western experts say cuba has received about 5 billion yearly in 
economic help and 15 billion in military aid for many of the past 
30 years 
the prensa latina agency in a dispatch from moscow did not 
reveal detailed information about the aid agreement which it said 
was signed after 10 days of talks 
the agreement was reached by the cuban foreign commerce 
minister ricardo cabrisas and the soviet economic relations 
minister konstantin katushev the agency reported 
cuban sources considered the volumes of soviet exports 
adjusted to the requirements of the country in the special period 
facing cuba said the agency monitored in mexico city 
the special period refers to austerity measures adopted to 
confront cubas loss of its friends in eastern europe the 
declining soviet economy and increases in the price of oil which 
cuba must import 
more and more goods are rationed in cuba communist officials 
are being shipped off to do farm work in the countryside and the 
leadership is promoting the use of bicycles to save gasoline 
the agency said cuba agreed to ship sugar nickel citrus 
tobacco alcoholic drinks medications and biotechnology products 
to the soviet union 
in return cuba will receive fuel cereals chemical and metal 
products machinery and other goods as well as continued technical 
and economic assistance 
foreign aid is to be considered by the soviet parliament next 
month and soviet officials have suggested cubas aid may be cut 
the soviet union wants its allies to pay in convertible currency 
at world prices starting jan 1 that would be a major blow to 
cuba which has long enjoyed subsidized soviet exports in return 
for exports shipped at inflated prices

hundreds of american indians held a 
spiritual ceremony saturday at this massacre site to commemorate 
the 100th anniversary of one of the saddest days in their history 
about 100 horseback riders and several hundred other people 
watched as indian spiritual leaders conducted the halfhour 
ceremony in subzero temperatures at the grave site of 146 sioux 
indians killed by us cavalry troops a century ago 
to us it was a massacre unjustified said mario gonzalez 
attorney for the wounded knee survivors association the army had 
no legal right to do what it did we want wounded knee to be 
remembered so it will never happen again 
russell means a leader of the militant american indian 
movement blocked the entrance to the cemetery when gov george 
mickelson showed up to pay his respects the governor made no 
effort to get past him but entered the cemetery later said an 
aide gretchen lord anderson 
it would be an insult for mickelson to enter because we live 
in the racist state of south dakota and he is the governor means 
said 
he said i wasnt welcome the governor said he wants to 
make a mockery of all that has occurred in reconciliation 
mickelson later declared 1990 the year of reconciliation as part 
of state efforts to improve relations between indians and 
nonindians 
the morning ceremony was conducted in temperatures of 21 below 
and a wind chill of 60 to 70 below zero 
riders who circled the cemetery rode past a spiritual leader 
holding up a can of burning sage they waved their hands and eagle 
feathers at the smoke to purify themselves as others beat drums and 
sang traditional songs 
the riders had retraced the 220mile journey that chief big foot 
and his band took before they were killed by cavalry troops at 
wounded knee the riders endured snow and subzero wind chills 
during part of their twoweek ride 
i think it weather was probably appropriate during this ride 
because indian people believe that when they make a pledge and 
commitment that suffering is part of that pledge and commitment 
said colorado congressman dan night horse campbell an indian 
the crowd later went to a school seven miles away for other 
ceremonies at which mickelson and others spoke the names of those 
who died at wounded knee were read 
the massacre at wounded knee is one of many dark moments in 
american history mickelson said 
mickelson said he was pledging my own commitment to learn from 
our past in order to build a future for all south dakotans 
regardless of race or culture 
the governor said he will keep trying to persuade federal 
officials to create a national monument at wounded knee the site 
should be preserved according to the wishes of wounded knee 
descendants he said 
hundreds of sioux men women and children were killed b us 
cavalry soldiers at wounded knee in an event that some historians 
said signified the end of the indian wars 
on friday nearly 300 horseback riders and others on foot 
endured windchill temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero 
friday on their way to the ceremony 
the riders assembled their horses in a circle at the massacre 
site friday and prayed for peace within the sioux nation and 
throughout the world 
two former american indian movement leaders means and dennis 
banks joined the riders last week some riders said they were 
bothered by the participation of activists associated with the 
armed takeover of wounded knee in 1973 which led to two deaths 
after sioux leader sitting bull was killed in december 1890 big 
foot led a band of about 400 sioux from central south dakota to 
seek refuge at the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern 
south dakota 
accounts differ as to who fired first and how many died when the 
cavalry intercepted the sioux the federal government says about 
150 indians died the sioux say as many as 400 were killed

a power outage darkened national airport 
outside the nations capital for four hours saturday and airline 
workers reverted to precomputer era methods to get travelers on 
their way 
security workers checked luggage by hand as xray machines went 
dark and ticket agents found themselves working without benefit of 
the computer reservation systems normally used 
there were some delays at the airport located just across the 
potomac river from washington and a few flights were canceled but 
a backup generator provided enough emergency power to keep air 
operations going 
the airports acting manager ronald strange said all airline 
computer reservation systems had been affected as well as baggage 
claim facilities 
airport personnel used flashlights to guide passengers through 
darkened corridors and down stairways no injuries were reported 
the first of two power lines that feed the airport blew at 1153 
am causing some areas to lose power 
the system automatically restored power to those areas by 
shifting the entire burden to the remaining line 
virginia power officials said however that a few minutes after 
noon someone in the airport inadvertently threw a switch that blew 
the other circuit 
the power failure lasted until about 4 pm officials said

mayorelect sharon pratt dixon is calling on 
aides to draft plans for 250 million in spending cuts to fight 
this citys burgeoning budget deficit without raising taxes her 
financial advisers say 
dixon who takes her oath of office wednesday promised in her 
campaign last fall that if elected she would not call for a tax 
increase 
aides said dixon who succeeds outgoing mayor marion barry 
hopes to lay the groundwork for an increase in federal aid to the 
city by showing congress and the white house she will back tough 
spending cuts 
shes going to try to show her bona fides before she asks for 
help top financial adviser franklin d raines said 
what dixon wants increased is the 435 million federal payment 
that is sent annually to the district of columbia government to 
help with the cost of running the city 
the federal payment which has not increased in five years is 
made in lieu of local taxes 
raines warned dixon in a dec 21 memo that the deficit for the 
fiscal year ending next sept 30 could reach 275 million to 300 
million 
dixon has asked aides to find budget cuts totaling about 250 
million more than 6 percent of the citys 38 billion operating 
budget 
the incoming mayor said last week she expects the federal 
government to substantially increase the annual payment many local 
politicians have been claiming that the federal government has been 
treating the city unfairly 
dixon said in her campaign that she could solve the budget 
problem by eliminating waste and inefficiency and cutting 2000 of 
the 48000 city workers she said she did not believe it would 
require cuts in programs and services 
but dixon may reconsider her support of pay raises for city 
workers raines indicated the city has planned for raises for 
teachers police officers and other city workers totaling roughly 
60 million to 80 million during the current fiscal year

just how bad a year was it for business 
ask michael milken or donald trump or citicorp 
by almost anyones standard 1990 failed to measure up for the 
start of a new decade the year was particularly disappointing 
it was a year of undoing and retreat of dashed hopes and 
unfulfilled promises fortunes were lost reputations were damaged 
big deals fell apart 
the economy slid into decline the stock market hit a record 
high and then tumbled downhill car sales slumped and consumers 
spent sparingly for christmas 
homebuilding stalled and real estate values in many parts of 
the country plummeted 
the buyouts of the 80s gave way to the bankruptcies of the 90s 
as heavy debts pushed enterprises big and small to the brink of 
collapse 
banks were left holding the bag for much of the mess having 
loaned billions for souring real estate deals and corporate 
takeovers 
the news turned bad even before iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 but 
the ensuing crisis in the persian gulf added a war premium to 
oil prices that drove up prices at the gasoline pump and stoked the 
embers of inflation 
it all inspired federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to 
pronounce a meaningful downturn in the economy near years end 
although he stopped short of using the r word to proclaim an 
official recession 
the chairman of one hardhit wall street firm was more blunt in 
his assessment of the 1990 environment business stinks george

the governments regular monthly statistics on the economy 
became a litany of woe in the waning weeks of the year 
unemployment reached 59 percent in november a threeyear high 
the index of leading economic indicators signaled the beginning of 
a recession with five consecutive monthly declines beginning in 
july 
as construction slowed sales of new homes dipped to their 
lowest level since the last recession eight years ago 
manufacturing also languished just this past week orders for 
durable goods items that last more than three years were 
reported off by 105 percent in november the drop was viewed by 
some economists as confirmation of a deepening recession 
the lone break in the chain of bad news was a moderate inflation 
report for november which provided an opening for the federal 
reserve to try to turn things around 
the fed which can influence the fate of the economy by 
regulating the nations money supply had been holding a tight rein 
on credit to keep inflation under control when inflation abated 
despite the lingering effects of the gulf crisis the fed took a 
dramatic step to ease credit by lowering its lending rate to banks 
the drop in the discount rate by a half point to 65 percent 
was the first cut in the rate in more than four years

the medicine might have worked wonders under normal 
circumstances but the nations banks were too weak to respond to 
the dose of easier credit only a handful of banks lowered their 
prime lending rates to business customers after the feds december 
move 
the biggest banks were busy shoring up their own finances on 
the same day the discount rate was cut citicorp the nations 
largest bank said it would set aside 340 million to cover bad 
loans and cut up to 8000 jobs 
many banks were shaky and the cost of insuring bank deposits 
against failures was skyrocketing william seidman head of the 
federal deposit insurance corp said the insurance fund would lose 
9 billion through 1991 leaving just 4 billion to guarantee 2 
trillion in deposits 
the hard times were expected to prompt a wave of consolidation 
in the industry that would leave fewer stronger banks

one of the most depressing experiences of the year for 
shareholders was watching the stock markets steady decline from 
the exhilarating heights of a record close in july a quarter point 
shy of the 3000 mark on the dow jones industrial average 
the fall was precipitated not by saddam hussein but by a rash 
of poor corporate earnings reports that preceded the kuwait 
invasion 
the gulf crisis added oil price worries to the mix and 
corporate earnings looked even bleaker by the third quarter 
most of the action in the financial markets shifted to the oil 
pits where barrels of crude for future delivery are traded 
frenzied speculation nearly doubled the price of a barrel of oil to 
more than 40 by october before it slid back under 30 toward 
years end 
the conventional wisdom held that the world was awash in oil 
but the supply side of the equation mattered little as long as the 
threat of a shooting war in the middle east loomed

one missing ingredient in the markets was merger mania it 
departed with the 80s
