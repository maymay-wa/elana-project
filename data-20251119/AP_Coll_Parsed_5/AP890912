in a city known for its brusqueness where 
officeholders are often loud and brash david dinkins comes across 
as something of an anomaly a gentleman politician 
dinkins the manhattan borough president defeated mayor edward 
i koch for the democratic mayoral nomination on tuesday thus 
earning a chance to become the citys first black mayor if he can 
outpoll republican rudolph giuliani in november 
he is a cautious and thoughtful politician a healer and 
conciliator and consensusbuilder according to his supporters 
a quiet man who reaches out to people said state attorney 
general robert abrams 
even opponents like the contentious koch concede that dinkins 
is a very decent guy 
but they question whether a nice guy can run a city facing a 
myriad of difficult problems stand up to special interests fighting 
over its 27 billion budget and ride herd over its more than 
200000 employees 
he has been careful to the point of timidity and his indecision 
sometimes frustrates his colleagues the new york times said of 
dinkins when it endorsed koch 
dinkins 62 has been in public life for more than two decades 
although he says he was hopelessly hooked on politics from his 
first race he does not have a reputation as being driven or a big 
risktaker 
ive never had the ambition particularly to be the citys first 
black mayor he said last year he announced his decision to run 
after forming a committee to examine what was needed for a mayoral 
bid a step that was derided by some 
a trenton nj native he graduated in 1950 from howard 
university with a mathematics degree he moved to harlem in 1951 and 
was married two years later 
he graduated from brooklyn law school in 1956 got involved in 
democratic politics and was elected to one term in the state 
assembly in 1965 
he served as city clerk for 10 years until he won the borough 
presidency in 1985 on his third attempt 
the citys highest elected black officeholder dinkins has stuck 
to his middleoftheroad approach in the citys often seething 
cauldron of racial and ethnic politics 
he has been outspoken against apartheid in south africa yet was 
slow to comment on the tawana brawley case when he did he was 
critical of her advisers he also has denounced statements by louis 
farrakhan as antisemitic 
in a display of independence he supported jesse jacksons 1984 
presidential bid when other black leaders backed walter mondale 
jackson returned the favor by coming to new york twice to campaign 
for dinkins 
one problem that has haunted dinkins was the four years 196871 
when he said he forgot to pay his income taxes 
he brushes off questions about that now saying it was an 
oversight that he has rectified 
he chooses instead to talk about his record as borough president 
on such issues as housing and homelessness aids services infant 
mortality and education 
of average height and with a slight paunch he exudes confidence 
and carries himself in a reserved and dignified manner hes an avid 
tennis player with a mean forehand even though hes a grandfather 
ive been described as a nice guy as a gentleman dinkins 
said last february but im also an exmarine and i dont intend 
for a second to get shoved around in this or any other campaign

public service company of new hampshire said 
tuesday it has agreed with creditors and shareholders on major 
points of a bankruptcy reorganization plan but gov judd gregg said 
the state had found a better deal 
the agreement was reached three days ahead of a deadline set by 
the federal bankruptcy court in manchester for reorganization plans 
and for buyout offers from other utilities 
but gregg told reporters at a news conference that a deal by 
massachusettsbased new england electric system was a dramatic 
improvement over proposals by public service and connecticutbased 
northeast utilities 
gregg who earlier backed the northeast utilities plan said the 
new england electric proposal has the states primary 
endorsement 
new england electric said that under its plan electricity rates 
for new hampshire customers would increase 48 percent for each of 
the next seven years regardless of whether the seabrook nuclear 
plant operates 
the 62 billion plant finished three years ago is idle for 
lack of a federal operating license public service is the plants 
lead owner 
the public service and northeast utilities plans call for 55 
percent increases for seven years and additional 11 percent hikes 
for five of those years if seabrook never operates 
northeast utilities is offering about 19 billion for public 
service whether or not seabrook runs new england electrics offer 
is 2 billion if seabrook runs 19 billion if it is canceled and 
public service valued its new proposal at 22 billion 
public service said creditors and investors already accepted the 
major points of its proposal which means its plan could be 
implemented much sooner than the other two which dont have such 
approval 
wilbur ross of rothschild inc financial advisers to the 
committee that represents public service stockholders said they 
agreed to the public service plan very reluctantly because its 
very painful he said it represented losses of 1 billion to 
stockholders and 300 million to bondholders 
he said the new england electric plan would inflict another 200 
million in losses on investors 
northeast spokesman jeffrey kotkin declined to compare plans 
without seeing details of his competitors proposals 
details of all plans must be submitted to bankruptcy judge james 
yacos by friday yacos plans hearings on the proposals into 
midnovember and then shareholders and creditors will vote on the 
plans 
public service the states largest electric utility filed for 
bankruptcy protection in january 1988 under the burden of its 36 
percent share of the seabrook plant 
public service had been unable to agree with creditors 
shareholders and the state on a reorganization plan and the state 
still is holding out

the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant was 
put on alert tuesday because state officials feared that an earthen 
dam might fail sending herbicidecontaminated water from a holding 
pond into suburban water supplies 
state health officials said they were concerned more that the 
runoff water holding pond contains herbicides than its radiation 
which is low but measurable and comparable with other water 
sources around the state 
holding pond c2 empties into womans creek and from there into 
standley lake which provides drinking water for the suburban denver 
communites of westminster thornton and northglenn 
rocky flats which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons is 16 miles northwest of denver and is operated for the 
department of energy by rockwell international corp 
doe officials had expressed concern about the earthen dam when 
heavy rainfall filled the pond to 75 percent of capacity they asked 
the state department of health for permission to release some water 
without treating it 
the state office of emergency preparedness which coincidentally 
was holding a drill at rocky flats on tuesday morning at 10 am 
issued an alert the thirdhighest level of preparedness for the 
facility 
in a 230 pm news conference colorado dropped its alert after 
an inspector for the state engineers office declared the dam was 
sound 
health officials denied does request to release the water 
without treating it saying the pond contains the herbicide 
atrazine a possible carcinogen as well as manganese and sulfide 
fbi agents and epa investigators raided the plant earlier this 
summer for evidence of illegal dumping of hazardous materials a 
federal grand jury is investigating the matter

three former hopkinton police dispatchers 
will share 1500 from the town for being told they couldnt write 
letters to the editor 
lynette labinger the american civil liberties union attorney who 
handled the case said the town agreed monday to pay each of the 
former dispatchers 500 to settle their us district court lawsuit 
the town also accepted an injunction against barring future letter 
writing by police dispatchers labinger said 
the three had drafted a letter to the westerly sun last year 
complaining about the town councils decision to lower their salary 
increases 
they argued they were grossly underpaid and should earn more 
than clerical employees because dispatchers made lifeanddeath 
decisions 
after a reporter made inquiries about doing an article on the 
dispute police chief george weeden barred the dispatchers from 
sending the letter the aclu claimed that was a violation of their 
freespeech rights 
were confident we would have prevailed at trial but this was

the bush administration is seeking to save 
money on us emergency oil reserves by possibly leasing rather 
than buying oil from saudi arabia and other major producers 
sources say 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer expressed his governments 
interest in the idea during private talks last thursday with energy 
secretary james d watkins although no specific proposals were made 
by either side the sources said 
the talks with the saudis and other potential foreign suppliers 
including norway kuwait venezuela and the united arab emirates 
are in a preliminary stage and the united states has made no 
decision to shift from the current practice of buying and holding 
title to all the oil put into the oil reserve sources said 
the main reason for leasing would be to reduce the cost of 
filling the strategic petroleum reserve which was created in 1975 
in response to the 1973 arab oil embargo led by saudi arabia mexico 
currently is the exclusive supplier under a sales contract due to 
expire nov 30 and providing 60000 barrels a day 
the oil is held in underground salt caverns in louisiana and 
texas congress earlier this year ordered the energy department to 
study leasing and to assess interest among foreign suppliers 
nazer told watkins his government was interested in a crude 
leasing deal as a way of strengthening saudi ties to the united 
states which is the largest market for saudi crude said the 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
theyre very interested one source said adding that leasing 
was the first subject raised by nazer in the meeting at energy 
department headquarters 
no details of a possible leasing deal were discussed and watkins 
told nazer the next step could be a meeting of the two sides 
technical experts the source said adding that senior us and 
saudi officials will pursue the matter further during regularly 
scheduled talks in october 
james akins who served as us ambassador to saudi arabia from 
197376 said a leasing arrangement would appear to be a good move 
for the bush administration 
from the point of view of the united states its an 
extraordinary good deal he said in a telephone interview i 
cant see anything wrong with it although i cant see any greater 
economic benefit for the saudis 
leasing rather than buying additional oil could be cheaper and 
could allow the administration to fill the reserve faster some 
critics have noted that because the nation is importing more of its 
daily crude requirements the strategic reserves value as an 
emergency fallback is diminishing 
at one point in 1985 the reserve held the equivalent of 115 days 
worth of us oil imports now it holds 73 days worth even though 
the reserve itself has continued to grow 
the energy department has not yet worked out the mechanics of a 
possible leasing arrangement although it is expected that a lease 
would allow the united states to take possession of the oil in the 
event of an emergency the source said a means of setting a 
purchase price would be included too 
were at the stage of entertaining any bright ideas about how 
a lease could be structured said one source 
norway also has expressed interest in the leasing idea although 
it has far less unused production capacity that could be activated 
for such a supply arrangement than do the saudis 
tore sandvold energy counselor at the norwegian embassy said he 
discussed leasing with energy department officials in august he 
said his government had made no decisions on the matter and its 
really just in the questionandanswer stage right now 
mexico has rejected the leasing idea one us source said while 
kuwait venezuela and the united arab emirates have indicated an 
interest

wildlife on federal preserves is being harmed 
by human activities ranging from military dogfight practice to 
waterskiers congressional investigators reported today 
interior department managers know that secondary uses of refuges 
are causing direct harm to wildlife general accounting office 
investigators concluded 
but they bow to intense local pressure for more recreation 
facilities or are forced by law to share ownership of the land with 
other government agencies or private interests such as those with 
drilling rights the report said 
the gao congress investigative arm reported on the refuges at 
the request of rep mike synar dokla chairman of the house 
government operations environment subcommittee and rep gerry e 
studds dmass chairman of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
environment subcommittee 
the us fish and wildlife service of the interior department 
which manages the preserves acknowledged the problems in testimony 
prepared for a joint hearing of the two committees 
david olsen an assistant director of the wildlife service said 
a review is underway to see whether the management system should be 
changed 
the gao investigators found that 
on the des lacs refuge in north dakota power boating and 
waterskiing have disturbed migratory bird nesting and the broods of 
newly hatched chicks duck and other bird production is 50 percent 
less than it could be 
at the chincoteague refuge in virginia offroad vehicles and 
thousands of visitors on the beaches are threatening the breeding of 
piping plovers an endangered bird and reducing other migratory 
bird populations 
at the cabeza prieta refuge in arizona military air exercises 
including airtoair missile firings are believed to be harming the 
desert bighorn sheep and the endangered sonoran pronghorn antelope 
the military is authorized to conduct the exercises 
livestock grazing at the browns park refuge in colorado is 
hampering efforts to improve goose and duck production disturbing 
the nesting birds and destroying plant growth necessary to provide 
optional nesting habitats 
drilling for new gas wells and operating existing wells at the 
darbonne refuge in louisiana is destroying the habitat of 
endangered red cockaded woodpeckers and other wildlife a federal 
judge has permitted the continued drilling 
with federal law requiring that refuge use be compatible with 
wildlife protection olsen said the issue of compatibility 
determinations will receive a lot of attention in the government 
review 
he said activities such as waterskiing on the des lacs refuse 
would clearly seem incompatible however it is an historic use of 
the area one which the local public has come to expect and is 
therefore extremely hard to curtail or eliminate as you might 
imagine 
he said the proximity of certain refuges to urban areas leads 
inevitably to pressure for picnic grounds camping facilities 
beaches boat ramps baseball fields target ranges and other forms 
of recreation 
once any of these forms of nonwildlife oriented public use 
becomes established it often increases and becomes difficult to 
terminate he said 
the gao report concluded after conducting a survey of refuges 
that managers reported that secondary uses are occurring on 92 
percent of all refuges and include all manner of public economic 
and military activities such as power boating mining military 
air exercises and use of offroad vehicles 
managers told the gao they were sometimes willing to accept the 
adverse effects of some harmful activities as the price of obtaining 
the good will of the local public or various economic interests

nearly a decade of progress on the scholastic 
aptitude test by female and minority youngsters stalled during the 
last school year the nations top education official termed the 
results disheartening 
statistics presented by the college board on monday show a 
widening race and gender gap among the 1088223 high school 
students who took the sat in 1989 
white students in the high school class of 1989 gained 2 points 
on their combined sat scores to 937 and now average 200 points 
higher than blacks whose mathverbal scores were unchanged from the 
previous year at 737 
womens combined scores dipped 2 points to 875 male 
testtakers averaged 934 1 point higher than a year earlier 
for all students sat averages showed little change for the 
fourth consecutive year average verbal scores dropped a point to 
427 from 1988 math scores were unchanged at 476 for a combined 903 
the combined national averages have changed little since 1985 
when they hit 906 
average composite scores on the act assessment the college 
entrance test that predominates in 28 mostly midwestern and western 
states dipped 02 point in 1989 to 186 averages on the fourpart 
exam assessing english math social studies and natural science 
skills are scored on a scale of 135 
the results were disheartening at the end of a decade marked by 
substantial education reform efforts said us education 
secretary lauro f cavazos 
the scores cavazos said pointed to an urgent need to 
restructure the nations elementary and secondary schools to create 
intellectual opportunities for all 
the sat sponsored by the college board and administered by the 
educational testing service in princeton nj is the predominant 
college entrance exam in 22 states the twopart multiplechoice 
test is scored on a scale of 200800 with a combined 1600 being a 
perfect score 
the act taken by 855171 high school students during the last 
school year is administered by american college testing of iowa 
city iowa the organization announced that beginning october 
students will receive 12 scores instead of the current five 
including seven new subscores in specific content areas of english 
math and reading 
robert g cameron executive director of research and development 
for the college board said he was disappointed by the erosion in 
average verbal scores he attributed the decline in part to an 
increase in recent years in the number of testtakers whose first 
language is not english 
the latest results also were certain to fuel the perennial debate 
over whether the tests are valid predictors of college success and 
whether as critics insist the tests are biased against females and 
minorities 
critics led by the cambridge massbased fairtest say sat 
questions tend to cover subjects that male and affluent testtakers 
are more likely to be familiar with 
college board president donald m stewart attributed the 
continued lag in sat averages among women and minority students to 
inequities in educational opportunities 
college board research reveals a strong relationship between 
the strength of a students high school preparation and his or her 
test scores stewart said thats why we believe that score 
differences among ethnic groups and between men and women reflect 
wide disparities in academic preparation or lack of it 
he nonetheless noted that scores among most minority groups have 
been gaining more rapidly than among whites during the 1980s at 
least until this year average scores among blacks for example 
gained 28 points on the sats math portion and 21 points on the 
verbal since 1979 
the latest scores prove that the college board and ets have 
failed to address the issue of bias said bob schaeffer coauthor 
of a newlypublished book standing up to the sat 
the sat is simply not a level playing field for women and 
minorities american indians suffered the biggest drop among 
ethnic groups averaging a combined 812 down 9 points on the verbal 
section and 7 on the math 
the best gain was by puerto ricans who rose 5 points on the 
verbal to 360 and 4 on the math to 406 during the decade the 
groups combined sat scores have risen 33 points 
among other groups asianamericans the highest scoring ethnic 
group gained a point to 409 on the verbal section and 3 on the 
math to 525 
mexicanamericans averaged 2 points better in the math to 430 but 
lost a point on the verbal at 381 for a combined 811 among other 
students identifying themselves as hispanic verbal scores were up 2 
to 389 and up 3 to 436 in the math

three federal agencies are denouncing an 
environmental groups campaign against the use of pesticides on 
food saying it pressures grocers to make regulatory decisions 
better left to the government 
the effort by the national toxics campaign appears to attempt 
to put the onus for pesticide regulation inappropriately on the us 
grocery industry said a joint statement by the environmental 
protection agency the food and drug administration and the 
agriculture department 
the bostonbased environmental group on monday announced 
agreement with a small number of grocery chains to sign a pledge 
designed to reduce pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables 
however the federal agencies said the government seeks to 
balance the benefits and risks of pesticides and accused the 
environmentalists of ignoring the fact that pesticides rid food 
products of diseases that could pose serious health concerns 
the grocery industry also attacked the effort saying the 
environmental group was seeking to create a major crisis of 
confidence in the nations food supply industry spokesmen accused 
the group of trying to pit company against company and retailers 
against their suppliers 
the use of pesticides on food has gained widespread attention 
following the uproar earlier this year over alar which ultimately 
was pulled off the us market by its manufacturer after sales of 
apple products plummeted costing the industry an estimated 100 
million 
craig merrilees director of the environmental groups consumer 
pesticide project expressed surprise at the strong industry and 
government reaction but said the group is enlisting grocers as 
allies in the war against pesticides because government regulation 
has not done the job 
weve given up on our governments ability to deal with 
pesticides said merrilees 
the companies that signed the agreement represent fewer than 200 
stores in the united states but merrilees called their 
participation a major breakthrough in getting supermarkets to 
break ranks with most of the industry on the pesticide issue 
signing the agreement were four regional us grocery chains and 
a large canadian chain and merrilees group said it hopes to 
convince other chains to join according to industry figures there 
are more than 35000 supermarkets in the united states 
dr samuel epstein a professor of environmental medicine at the 
university of illinois and persistent critic of the widespread use 
of pesticides maintained there has been a virtual total failure 
of the regulatory system in protecting consumers against 
pesticides in foods 
were now seeing the emergence of market force pressures 
said epstein who participated in the environmental groups news 
conference monday 
the agreement announced monday commits the retailers to little 
beyond general goals of seeking a reduction in pesticides on foods 
in the agreement the grocers pledge to request growers to 
disclose what pesticides were used on produce to actively 
encourage the phasing out of cancercausing chemicals on produce 
by 1995 and to whenever economically feasible carry 
certified organic produce and produce certified to contain no 
detected pesticide residues 
nevertheless spokesmen for distributors processors and 
retailers of fruits and vegetables denounced the campaign 
we do not want to be the nations food police declared karen 
brown a spokeswoman for the food marketing institute a trade group 
representing more than 1500 grocery chains and stores 
these organizations are seeking to create a major crisis of 
confidence in the food supply and coerce supermarket retailers 
into assuming the job of government said robert carey president 
of the produce marketing association 
the five retail grocery chains that are participating in the 
national toxics campaign program are provigo inc the second 
largest grocery chain in canada with more than 1000 stores petrini 
supermarkets a subsidiary of provigo 23 stores in the san 
francisco area raleys supermarkets 57 stores in the sacramento 
calif area abco supermarkets 87 stores in arizona and bread amp

tomato lovers who shop at farm markets or have 
backyard patches of their own are nearing the time of autumnal gloom 
it descends with the first killing frost and nothing will 
suffice until next year not tomatoes shipped from mexico or the 
warm southern areas of the united states 
soaring tomato prices were a major contributor to a sharp rise in 
consumer food costs last winter says the agriculture department 
retail vegetable prices which had been expected to ease in the 
first quarter of 1989 rose an average of 57 percent 
much of that increase was blamed on cold weather in mexico 
florida and california which cut supplies of fresh vegetables 
including tomatoes there was also some lingering effect from last 
years searing drought 
in the first half of 1989 prices paid to commercial tomato 
growers averaged more than 41 per 100 pounds up from 26 during 
the same period of last year 
a late january freeze in mexico slowed shipments to us 
consumers and boosted retail tomato prices by 48 percent in the 
first quarter a freeze in florida in late february damaged the 
newly planted spring crop and added further problems 
prices paid to us tomato growers rose to a record of 5580 per 
100 pounds in april and retail prices averaged a record 132 per 
pound in may 
gary lucier of the departments economic research service said 
august figures show tomato prices at the farm dropped to less than 
half of the earlier record level 
were in better shape now lucier said monday in a telephone 
interview we could see some fluctuations up and down for the next 
few months but typically if there arent any freezes i dont 
see any problem 
after peaking in may at the record retail price of 132 per 
pound nationally consumers by june saw tomatoes ease back to 87 
cents per pound as new seasonal supplies took hold 
and then it was time for locally grown produce to make its market 
entry the tomatoes melons sweet corn squash and other items 
that headline thousands of roadside stands and farm markets each 
summer 
even the industry recognizes that in the summertime anyway 
theres a lull in demand for tomatoes because of home gardens 
lucier said prices are typically at their low point

the us sheep flock has increased slightly in 
recent years but still is one of the smallest inventories since the 
agriculture department began keeping track in 1867 global sheep 
numbers meanwhile are at record levels 
currently the worlds sheep flock is estimated at 1145 billion 
head up 2 percent from a year ago according to a report by the 
departments economic research service most of the increase is in 
china australia and the european economic community 
the us flock of sheep and lambs as of jan 1 was estimated 
earlier this year at 108 million head up fractionally from a year 
earlier inventories have been declining generally for many years 
since a peak of 562 million in 1942 
as a result the us wool clip has also been relatively small 
although the 1988 production of shorn wool increased 5 percent from 
1987 to 892 million pounds 
comparatively us mills used about 352 million pounds of wool 
in the second quarter of this year down slightly from januarymarch 
but up about 4 percent from the second quarter of 1988 the report 
said 
with mill use up wool imports have risen totaling 319 million 
pounds in the second quarter of 1989 up nearly 10 percent from 
januarymarch and 26 percent more than in the same period of last 
year 
australia new zealand and the united kingdom are major suppliers 
the 198889 world output of wool is estimated at a record 712 
billion pounds on a greasy or uncleaned basis up by more than 2 
percent from last year the report said 
most of this increase occurred in australia the main source of 
apparel wool entering export trade where excellent pasture 
conditions and large sheep numbers caused 198889 production to be 
almost 209 billion pounds greasy 36 percent above the previous 
season the report said china and argentina also experienced 
larger production 
new zealand the major source of coarser grades of wool used in 
carpets blankets and heavy clothing reported a decline in

last weeks sale to the soviet union of 50000 
metric tons of surplus butter held by the agriculture department 
averaged less than 74 cents a pound or a little more than half of 
what it cost american taxpayers 
the sale for a total of 809 million involved a price to the 
soviets of 1618 per ton the department said at 2205 pounds per 
ton that was about 733 cents per pound 
according to a recent usda inventory accounting the commodity 
credit corp which acquires and stores surplus butter under the 
governments milk price support program had about 140 per pound 
invested in its butter stockpile that translates into about 3087 
per ton 
but moscow didnt get a special price break according to usda 
officials congress in 1985 and 1988 legislation ordered usda to 
sell for export 150000 tons of dairy products per fiscal year 
through september 1990 
so far this year sales total about 84000 tons including the 
butter sale to the soviet union prices charged foreign buyers must 
be competitive on the world market

a capital gains tax cut endorsed by president 
bush is drawing fire from liberal economists who call it an unfair 
windfall for the rich that will worsen the deficit and do nothing to 
stimulate savings 
it is at best a budgetary quick fix with harmful longterm 
consequences five economists said in a letter to congress monday 
it is at worst yet another shell game which will redistribute the 
nations wealth toward those already most welloff 
one of the five lawrence summers of harvard university said the 
proposal may well be the worst tax idea in the history of the 
republic 
the criticism came as the house ways and means committee prepared 
to resume consideration of the proposed capital gains cut the most 
recent unofficial count indicated that all 13 republicans on the 
committee and six democrats a bare majority favored the proposal 
the committees democratic leadership has been delaying a vote on 
the cut sponsored chiefly by reps ed jenkins dga and bill 
archer rtexas 
rep dan rostenkowski dill who opposes a reduction has 
drafted a substitute in hopes of knocking down the bushendorsed 
jenkinsarcher plan aides say rostenkowski is broadening his 
proposal so the reduction would apply to some assets already held 
the committee expects to take a final vote this week 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stock land and 
other assets are taxed at the same rates as wages and other income 
bush says a capital gains cut would stimulate the economy and 
increase revenue collections by encouraging taxpayers to cash in 
longheld investments 
under the jenkinsarcher plan the 33 percent maximum tax rate 
would be cut to 196 percent for capital gains for 2 years it then 
would be raised to 28 percent and indexed so that profits caused 
solely by inflation would not be taxed 
democrats in congress generally oppose a capital gains reduction 
their main arguments presented monday in writing by the five 
economists were 
eighty percent of the benefits from the jenkinsarcher bill 
would go to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
noting that the 1986 tax overhaul sharply reduced all tax rates 
by taking away preferences for capital gains and other deductions 
the economists wrote to restore that preference now would leave 
the tax system tilted unconscionably toward those who already enjoy 
the greatest share of our nations bounty 
because the reduction would be temporary it will reward those 
who have already made profitable investments and not at all those 
who must choose whether to invest in the future 
from a budget standpoint a capital gains tax cut is a clear 
loser after a quick surge revenues will fall 
as to stimulating savings the economists wrote evidence is 
completely lacking that a cut in tax rates on capital gains will 
have any effect on savings 
three of the economists attended a news conference hosted by 
reps donald pease dohio and sander levin dmich ways and 
means members who oppose a reduction 
summers joseph minarik executive director of congress joint 
economic committee and henry aaron of the brookings institution 
spoke at the news conference also signing the letter were alan 
auerbach and alan blinder chairmen of the economics departments at 
respectively university of pennsylvania and princeton university 
meanwhile another ways and means member who opposes a capital 
gains cut rep byron l dorgan dnd sought to deny any benefit 
from such a reduction to those with incomes over 200000 a year

the government says it will order modification 
of more than 1100 mcdonnell douglas jetliners to help them grow old 
safely 
the action similar to that taken for boeing airliners earlier 
this year is the result of an airline industrygovernment task 
forces effort to address growing concern over the worlds aging 
airliner fleet more than half the passenger jets flying are over 20 
years old 
the federal aviation administration announced monday it will 
issue within a few days airworthiness directives covering older 
dc10 dc9 dc8 and md80 airliners in line with task force 
recommendations announced at the same time the cost for us 
airlines flying mcdonnell douglas jets is expected to total 53 
million over the next four years the faa said 
industry officials at a joint news conference with the faa said 
it could eventually cost 10 times that much for the worldwide 
mcdonnell douglas fleet over the next 20 years but officials said 
much of the work already has been done or planned and they do not 
expect it to affect service or fares 
let me emphasize that the safety record of commercial aircraft 
continues to be excellent said clyde kizer of the air transport 
association 
jim lundy spokesman for delta air lines which flies 75 
mcdonnell douglas planes said the faa orders do not indicate older 
airlines are unsafe 
this a way to make absolutely positively sure that the 
integrity of the airplane is maintained he said 
industry officials said the mcdonnell douglas and boeing planes 
can fly safely as long as various parts of the fuselage landing 
gears and doors are replaced 
the task force which made recommendations affecting boeing 
airliners earlier this year included engineers and officials from 
the faa other government agencies airlines airplane manufacturers 
and foreign airlines and aviation agencies it is to report on 
planes built by other manufacturers by the end of the year 
the work is to be done after each plane reaches a set number of 
landings depending on the aircraft model and the items to be 
replaced 
so far the government has agreed airliners can continue to fly 
well beyond their original design goals as long as they are properly 
maintained although there is some support in congress to set a 
mandatory retirement age for jetliners 
the initial mcdonnell douglas changes are less extensive and less 
costly than those affecting boeing which average more than 1 
million per plane 
dale warren mcdonnell douglas vice president estimated the cost 
under the planned faa order would average 290000 per plane 
74000 for dc10s 161000 for dc8s 490000 for dc9s and 
90000 for md80s 
the higher cost for dc9 modifications was due primarily to the 
need for costly replacements in the landing gears warren said 
the faa order will cover only us planes over the next four 
years with work required as each airliner logs a set number of 
landings said ray ramakis assistant faa director for maintenance 
programs and flying standards the landings threshold varies for 
each type of aircraft and for the type of work to be done 
ramakis said the orders initially will cover 218 dc8s 568 
dc9s 173 md80s and 194 dc10s the dc8s date back to the late 
1950s with dc9s first built in 1964 and replaced by the md80 in 
the 1980s dc10s were first used in the early 1970s 
foreign airlines and regulatory agencies generally adopt faa 
orders for usbuilt aircraft 
robert aaronson ata president said the orders are not linked to 
the july 19 crash of a united airlines dc10 in sioux city iowa 
which killed 112 people a separate industrygovernment group is 
studying the design of larger airliners partly as a result of that 
crash 
the aging airliner task force was set up after an aloha airlines 
737 with nearly 90000 flights lost an 18foot section of fuselage 
in an april 1988 flight over hawaii a flight attendant was killed

as the us war on drugs begins to put a crimp 
in drug lords operations americans may become targets for 
terrorists both in south america and at home say government and 
private witnesses 
this assassination of government officials legislators and 
judges will no longer solely be a colombian indeed andes 
problem said robert h kupperman a senior adviser at the center 
for strategic and international studies in washington the 
phenomenon may well spread to our borders the american people must 
understand the true costs of waging an aggressive campaign 
with their enormous wealth and easy access to advanced weapons 
it is not beyond the realm of the possible that exocet missiles 
might be directed against coast guard cutters or stingers 
antiaircraft missiles against us commercial aircraft 
kupperman said monday 
so far terrorist acts have focused primarily on colombians 
including a leading presidential candidate a former mayor of the 
drug cartel center of medellin and other officials 
but if us efforts to shut down growing processing and shipment 
of cocaine prove effective americans are likely to become terrorist 
targets a series of witnesses told the senate governmental 
operations committee 
if the drug cartels mount a campaign to have blood running in 
the streets of america i cant give you assurances we would be in a 
position to preempt it conceded oliver b revell investigations 
chief for the federal bureau of investigation 
revell and others said south americas cocaine empires already 
have shown their ruthlessness and inclination to use the techniques 
of terrorism when their operations are pinched 
they have dealt in blood since their inception revell said 
adding that he expected the first strikes to come against american 
targets personnel and facilities in colombia the hub of the 
cocaine trade 
its easier for them to operate there he said but that 
does not mean we are not vulnerable here in the united states the 
cocaine cartels already have elaborate networks in place inside us 
borders and have carried out assassinations primarily of other drug 
traffickers 
revell noted that colombian drug lords hired a team in 1987 which 
assassinated barry seal a former drug pilot and an informant for 
the drug enforcement administration in louisiana 
and cartel operatives enlisted the colombian urban leftist 
guerilla group m19 in 1985 to storm the palace of justice in bogota 
and assassinate supreme court judges 
if the united states is successful in extraditing drug figures 
for trial it is quite clear that this group will respond 
violently said another witness brian michael jenkins of the rand 
corporation we have to anticipate the possibility of 
hostagetaking there is no question they have the capacity there 
is no question they have the record 
elsewhere on capitol hill lawmakers were responding to president 
bushs antidrug initiative and making suggestions to beef it up 
sen dennis deconcini dariz an intelligence committee member 
said a secret bush directive authorizes the military to be 
physically involved with units in the field where we have been 
invited to have our law enforcement people 
deconcini said the military would be able to offer protection to 
drug enforcement agents and other law enforcement officials in the 
field in bolivia and peru and also called on the cia and other 
intelligence agencies to share information with law enforcement 
agencies 
and sen john kerry dmass chairman of a narcotics 
subcommittee and sen mitch mcconnell rky asked treasury 
secretary nicholas brady to convene a summit of bank presidents to 
increase the focus on moneylaundering aspects of the drug problem

the food and drug administration plans to take 
a closer look at 11 generic drug companies where inspections turned 
up serious manufacturing and recordkeeping problems 
irregularities that ranged from falsified records to 
misrepresentation of test data were found at 11 of the 13 companies 
that make generic versions of brandname drugs paul f vogel 
deputy director of the fdas generic drug compliance staff told a 
house subcommittee monday 
the investigations into the companies where problems were found 
are continuing and the fda is reviewing the operations of 20 more 
companies and testing samples of the 30 leading generic drugs one 
of the companies has admitted substituting a brandname drug for its 
own in sampling tests 
we dont think our job is yet completed said vogel 
the investigation sparked by evidence turned up by the house 
energy and commerce investigations subcommittee has resulted in 
charges against three fda employees two generic drug makers and 
former executives at the companies as well as fda action to remove 
dozens of generic drugs from the market 
we can no longer be sure that generic drugs are safe and 
effective said rep john dingell the subcommittee chairman 
he added however for those drugs with broad therapeutic 
ranges there is probably little danger to the consumer 
vogel did not say whether disciplinary action against the 
companies is being considered but he noted in the case of one the 
superpharm corp we are presently considering our options 
rep thomas bliley rva ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said the fda must rein in the generic drug makers as 
more drug patents expire and become eligible for generic 
applications 
if there was already an incentive to pay illegal gratuities 
submit fraudulent samples and make false statements on generic drug 
applications the temptation to cut corners will grow unless the bad 
actors are driven out of the industry he said 
fda officials said deficiencies were found at american 
therapeutics inc of bohemia ny barrenational of baltimore 
bolar pharmaceuticals of copiague ny par pharmaceuticals of 
spring valley ny pharmaceutical basics inc of morton grove 
ill and denver colo pharmafair of hauppauge ny a subsidiary 
of bausch and lomb of rochester ny quad pharmaceuticals of 
indianapolis sidmak laboratories of east hanover nj superpharm 
corp of central islip ny and bayshore ny vitarine 
pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens ny and watson 
laboratories of corona calif 
vogel said fda found no significant problems at two 
manufacturers able laboratories of south plainfield nj and 
zenith labs of ramsey nj he said neither is a major manufacturer 
of generic drugs 
vitarine has admitted substituting the brandname drug dyazide 
for its generic copy in tests to win fda approval and has since 
removed its product from the market the fda is investigating to 
determine whether bolar did the same with its generic version of the 
drug used for high blood pressure 
current and former officials of par and quad which is a 
subsidiary of par appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena 
but most declined to answer questions claiming protection under the 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
among those who declined to testify were ashok patel former 
senior vice president of par and dilip shah former president of 
quad a subsidiary of par both of whom pleaded guilty to bribing 
fda chemists to win approval for generic drug applications 
comment from other companies was not immediately forthcoming 
people answering the telephone at pharmafair and pharmaceutical 
basics said no one could be reached until tuesday there was no 
answer at vitarine and at barrenational

democrats say they must take care not to head 
into the 1992 presidential campaign as the party of taxes while 
republicans take credit for the war on drugs 
in fighting with the president for our vision of americas 
future lets not lead with our chin party chairman ronald h 
brown told a meeting of democratic strategists monday 
when we entangle ourselves in talk about taxes before we lay 
out clear longterm goals and objectives we dampen the 
publicspirited response of americans who want to believe that we 
can act together to make a difference brown said 
robert g beckel a veteran democratic political consultant said 
the response of some democrats to president bushs drug speech 
identified their party with higher taxes 
within 24 hours of the news cycle they the republicans got 
drugs and we got taxes as issues beckel said 
looking forward to the 1992 presidential campaign he asked 
why give the next guy a drug policy in which the republicans stand 
for getting tough on drugs and we stand for taxing to get tough on 
drugs 
democrats have criticized bushs program as being inadequately 
funded and rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee said unless the president supports the 
tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug 
dealers are going to win 
the oneday conference was organized by robert rubin a new york 
investment banker active in democratic affairs and richard medley 
who runs a consulting firm in washington that concentrates on 
economic issues 
brown urged democrats to starting preaching the democratic 
gospel by calling for a newly vigorous public spirit but he 
added programmatic liberalism is not the gyroscope that guides 
the national democratic party 
he said rankandfile democrats believe that the new deal 
shaped our history and message as democrats over four decades but 
now they are ready for something more

the bush administration is giving tentative 
backing to legislation that would attack the disparity between the 
health of whites and minorities by encouraging training of more 
black and hispanic doctors and nurses 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan told sen 
edward m kennedy on monday that several of the provisions in a bill 
kennedy is introducing would help in his own quest for improved 
minority health 
sullivan former head of the morehouse university school of 
medicine said he favors kennedys proposal to spend 117 million in 
fiscal 1991 to expand minority training programs he said he expects 
the money to be added to the hhs budget rather than be transferred 
from other programs 
but sullivan stopped short of a formal endorsement saying the 
justice department has expressed concern about the constitutionality 
of provisions that would set aside grants for scholarships at 
predominantly black medical schools 
kennedy dmass expressed confidence any problems could be 
worked out since they involved distribution formulas rather than the 
shared goal of increasing financial support for minority medical 
students 
be set 
up for nursing schools 
while the legislation would focus on stimulating medical training 
for minority students lawmakers said general health education 
directed at minority groups will play a major role in improving 
health among those groups 
hatch said at a hearing of the senate labor and human resources 
committee that much of the gap between white and minority health can 
be closed through improved public education and better 
coordination of services for minorities 
smoking among adult males continues to be about 25 percent 
higher among blacks than among whites he noted as an example 
dr herbert nickens vice president for minority health disease 
prevention and health promotion for the association of american 
medical colleges called for a special congressional committee to 
ride herd on how minority health issues are coordinated at the 
federal level 
he agreed that mass education is a cornerstone to improved health 
health promotion and disease prevention is an essential 
component of any minority health strategy because the diseases which 
kill us in america now depend heavily on our behavior and 
lifestyle said nickens a former head of the hhs office of 
minority health

house republican leader bob michel says its 
all right with him if lawmakers vote for a statute prohibiting 
desecration of the flag so long as democrats allow a vote this fall 
on a constitutional amendment 
while i personally have to be opposed to the statute because 
im supporting the amendment process there are a number of members 
who want to vote for most anything to protect the flag michel 
said monday 
although there is little argument between democrats and 
republicans about the desire for congressional remedy for a supreme 
court decision giving first amendment protection to flag 
desecration there has been wide disagreement about how that should 
be done 
the house was taking the first crack at the matter today in the 
form of the statute pushed by democrat leaders who dont want to go 
the republicanbacked route of amending the constitution 
i happen to think the language even tends to weaken the current 
statute michel said the bill would make desecration of a flag a 
federal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment 
on the eve of todays house action republican and democrats 
discussed an agreement that would allow a vote on the statute as 
well as a later vote on an amendment 
these talks came as president bush traveled to capitol hill and 
had lunch with former house colleagues reps sonny montgomery 
dmiss and john paul hammerschmidt rark the congressmen said 
bush briefly discussed the flag issue with them 
although bush made no comments as he left the capitol both 
montgomery and hammerschmidt said they believed the president 
despite his preference for a constitutional amendment would not 
veto flagprotection legislation passed by congress 
he understands that politically members have to have a chance 
to vote on a statute hammerschmidt said 
montgomery chairman of the veterans affairs committee said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told him friday he would let 
the house vote on a flag amendment in november 
i think its pretty locked in montgomery said 
montgomery said he would vote for the statute until now many 
veterans groups have been pressuring lawmakers to oppose the statute 
because they fear it would preclude a vote on a constitutional 
amendment which they prefer 
michel sidestepped reporters questions about the discussions 
with the congressional leadership 
michel said he was still working with foley with the 
expectation we would have the same kind of agreement as is current 
in the senate where therell be a vote on the statute and assured 
vote on an amendment some time later

the unrest in china last may disrupted crucial 
arms shipments to moslem guerrillas in afghanistan crippling their 
drive to dislodge the sovietbacked regime there us officials say 
the interruption in the arms flow from china was only one strand 
in a complex web of events that has stalemated the afghan war six 
months after guerrillas forced the soviets to end a nineyear 
occupation say administration and congressional sources 
the united states has been sending the afghan guerrillas about 
600 million in arms a year since 1986 purchasing many of them from 
china which shipped them to pakistan for rail transport to 
peshawar a border town where seven major resistance parties are 
based 
saudi arabia has been buying the guerrillas a smaller amount of 
arms said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
following the crackdown on prodemocracy forces in china the 
chinese came to us and said our rail shipments are being 
disrupted said one source we werent sure whether that was 
true or they were mad because the united states was supporting the 
democratic movement there 
at about the same time the cia and its pakistani counterpart 
the interservice intelligence cut the flow of arms to afghan 
parties based in peshawar 
they were finetuning the pipeline one source said seeking 
to decrease arms supplies to the lackluster afghan interim 
government based in peshawar and send them directly to guerrillas 
inside afghanistan 
officials at the cia and other agencies also badly miscalculated 
the amount of aid the kremlin was sending to the najibullah regime 
in kabul and misjudged the ability of that government to cling to 
power sources said 
the head of the cia covert aid program to afghanistan has been 
shifted to other duties and although he has not been reprimanded 
has been cast as a scapegoat for the faltering us policy said 
one administration source 
since the red army pulled out in february sources said moscow 
has been sending an estimated 250 million to 300 million in arms 
per month to kabul about five times the level of aid going to the 
anticommunist guerrillas 
the guerrillas at the urging of pakistani intelligence began an 
assault against jalalabad a major administrative center in eastern 
afghanistan 
but the offensive sputtered because the supply of arms to the 
guerrillas dropped off sharply and because of infighting among the 
seven parties based in peshawar said the us sources 
the us government while maintaining support for the afghan 
interim government has cut the supply of arms to the peshawar 
parties by half sending the remainder directly to guerrilla leaders 
inside afghanistan 
we need to get the stuff directly to the people who are doing 
the fighting said one source 
the policies of the cia and the bush administration in general 
have come under fierce attack from members of congress who have 
voted large amounts of money for the afghan resistance and expected 
victory over the kremlinbacked regime 
the cia has secretly pursued a wrongheaded afghan policy for 
years the chairman of the republican task force on terrorism and 
unconventional warfare wrote in an opinion piece that appeared 
sunday in the washington post 
the congressman rep bill mccollum rfla said the worst 
blunder was allowing pakistani intelligence to give most of us 
saudi and chinese arms shipments to the hezbiiislami the party 
headed by gulbadin hekmatyar one of the seven resistance leaders 
based in peshawar 
as it shifted the flow of supplies from hekmatyar and the other 
peshawarbased resistance parties the bush administration was also 
developing ties with the last king of afghanistan mohammad zahir 
shah who was deposed in 1974 and lives in rome 
talking with the king is not a shift in policy said one 
administration official but it is part of a wider strategy to find 
a way to breathe life into the faltering afghan resistance

federal regulators are seeking millions of 
dollars in restitution from two commodity options firms charged with 
misleading their customers about risky investments 
siegel trading company inc based in chicago and international 
trading group ltd with headquarters in san mateo calif were 
sued separately monday by the commodity futures trading commission 
this is probably the largest antifraud sales solicitation case 
the cftc has ever brought said dennis klejna director of the 
commissions enforcement division 
the suits were filed in us district court for the central 
district of california accused the firms of charging clients 45 
percent commissions while giving investors advice they knew or 
should have known was wrong or incomplete 
both lawsuits seek preliminary injunctions barring the firms from 
continuing their alleged illegal practices klejna said the cftc 
also would seek to have the firms return all profits made through 
illegal practices 
a spokesman for chicagobased siegel was not in his office when 
called for comment and did not return a reporters phone call monday 
evening 
in san mateo calif itg issued a statement saying it was 
reviewing the charges but intended to fight them vigorously itg 
sales practices comply with applicable law and regulation do not 
mislead potential or actual customers and are proper in all 
respects it said 
itg also said it is not connected in any way with siegel 
options are contracts that give their owners the right to conduct 
a specified transaction such as buying or selling a certain number 
of shares of a given common stock at a set price within a stated 
period of time usually just a few months 
options can be highly risky and since they are usually shortterm 
investment vehicles they involve a lot of buying and selling for 
which commissions must be paid each time 
in the itg case the cftc said that between jan 1 1984 and may 
31 1989 more than 85 percent of the firms customers lost a total 
of 428 million 283 million of it in commissions collected by itg 
in the other case from jan 1 1984 until the present about 85 
percent of siegels customers lost money totaling 336 million 
for the same period the firm took in 40 million in commissions

the 17nation european jewish congress has endorsed 
suspending formal contact between jewish groups and the roman 
catholic church because of the dispute over a convent at the 
auschwitz death camp in poland 
at issue is the word of the church it is difficult to speak 
with someone when you have this kind of problem said theo klein 
who led the french delegation monday at the annual meeting 
klein a former president of the european jewish congress said 
he has appealed to jewish organizations to suspend official contacts 
with the catholic church he said there had been no dissent 
each organization is free to make its own policy so i cannot 
say to you that all organizations have stopped dialogue but i think 
so said klein who helped negotiate a 1987 pact with catholic 
leaders to remove the carmelite convent 
the meeting was dominated by the convent issue which has split 
catholics and revived debates about lingering antisemitism in 
europe 
many jews regard the convent at the camp where at least 25 
million jews were among the estimated 4 million victims during world 
war ii as offensive 
under the 1987 accord negotiated between jewish representatives 
and officials of the catholic church including polish cardinal 
franciszek macharski it was agreed the convent should be removed by 
feb 22 
but the polish primate cardinal jozef glemp continues to back 
the convent which was intalled in 1984 in a hut where the nazis 
stored gas used to murder jews and other inmates 
glemp has said the geneva agreement was not negotiated by 
competent people and after summer protests by jewish activists 
at the convent angered jews and nonjews alike with remarks many 
people consider antisemitic 
two french cardinals and a belgian cardinal who helped negotiate 
the 1987 agreement have rejected glemps stance insisting the pact 
be carried out 
klein said he wrote to cardinal albert decourtray frances 
catholic leader and a party to the negotiations in july announcing 
that all formal jewishcatholic contacts would cease until the 
convent issue is resolved 
since then klein said he has refused all invitations from 
catholic organizations including a recent invitation to address a 
french catholic student body 
the catholics themselves understand it is very difficult to 
have a dialogue now without having solved this problem of the 
carmelites he said 
informal contacts will continue with the european catholic 
cardinals who want to stick to the agreement klein said 
it seems to me that in the vatican some people will try to find 
a solution but if it will be the boss i dont know said klein 
referring to pope john paul ii who has not publicly expressed his 
opinion on the issue 
lionel kopelowitz president of the european jewish congress 
said the meeting endorsed the suspension of formal contacts 
in a resolution the congress urged swift removal of the convent 
and said it hoped that the hitherto fruitful jewishcatholic 
dialogue strongly affected by the situation will not suffer 
lasting damage 
auschwitz itself is holy ground said kopelowitz it needs 
no memorial of any sort to any faith it is soaked in the blood 
of all those who died 
glemp has canceled a us visit scheduled to start on sept 21 
the polish news agency pap reported over the weekend 
the announcement came after us jewish leaders said they planned 
to sue glemp for defamation claiming he implied that jewish 
protesters sought to harm the nuns during a july 14 demonstration at 
the camp

under redtinted photographs of a smiling 
mikhail s gorbachev raising a vodka toast american teenagers are 
raiding new perestroika boutiques at bloomingdales for a hot 
new clothing fad soviet military jackets festooned with campaign 
medals 
if gorbachev is seeking a vote of confidence from the west for 
his reform policies where better to look than bloomies the trendy 
bastion of capitalist consumerism and affluent teenage customers on 
buying sprees 
miraed smith publicity director for the new yorkbased 
department store chain reported a heavy demand for soviet exports 
of khakicolored armystyle jackets with fake fur collars and 
hoods which retail for 190 
youngsters decorate them with elaborately colored enamel medals 
commemorating everything from lenin to soviet space exploits and 
wartime triumphs the medals sell for 5 to 15 apiece depending on 
size 
the kids think all this is sizzling and cool ms smith said 
in a telephone interview from new york 
bloomingdales which takes pride in anticipating fashion trends 
believes it has found a new frontier in the soviet market said 
pat cummings public relations director for bloomingdales two 
stores in the washington suburbs of maryland and virginia 
she said sales have been brisk since perestroika boutiques 
opened here on friday the counters are stacked with soviet 
tshirts wristwatches and just the item for the american shopper 
credit card holders in redbordered black leather 
ms smith said bloomies started selling soviet goods in may when 
it bought some black russian rye bread which sells for about 30 
cents in moscow from an unnamed american importer our people 
tasted it and said it was the most luscious bread theyd ever 
eaten she said they went absolutely wild over it 
bloomies called it peace bread and sold 1500 loaves in the 
first week at its manhattan store people didnt hesitate to spend 
6 a loaf she said 
suspecting that their customers were intrigued by almost anything 
made in the soviet union bloomies buyers ordered more tshirts 
and sweatshirts bearing indecipherable cyrillic slogans 
militarystyle wrist and pocket watches with lots of dials and 
buttons sunglasses medals and an assortment of russian cakes and 
cookies including hard biscuits traditionally dipped in wine or hot 
tea 
bloomies has buyers in moscow ordering additional goods which 
they hope will arrive in time for the christmas season and in 
quantities large enough to outfit perestroika boutiques in all 
of bloomingdales 17 stores most of them in the northeast but 
others in chicago miami and dallas 
officials said negotiations are under way with soviet authorities 
for a reciprocal agreement that would allow bloomingdales to build 
a couple of outlets in moscow possibly at the airport and a 
downtown hotel 
i think perestroika is here to stay but boy do i hope im 
right said bill lane a bloomingdales buyer who sees enormous 
potential in the soviet union as a producer of exotic new consumer 
goods for the us market 
in this era of glasnost lane said the military flavor of the 
jackets wristwatches and other soviet goods appearing in american 
stores carries a far different more hopeful message than it once 
did 
military is a fashion not a means of making war he said 
its a look and thats a wonderful thing were glorifying the 
end of war were not celebrating destruction were celebrating 
military as fashion

for more and more high school students mousse abuse is taboo so 
is hair down to there and though they dont necessarily have to 
dress for success some say they must dress under duress 
along with perpetual peer pressure to wear in clothes and 
sport the latest trendy haircuts whether its a batman insignia or 
a moussedup do american teenagers are facing dress and hair 
codes that impose official ideas of fashion 
in a flashback to the 60s some students are protesting what 
they consider infringements on their right to free expression 
its very regrettable when educators fail to see that kids have 
rights and that breathing down their necks about ways they should be 
able to express themselves is not encouraging real education said 
leanne kats executive director of the national coalition against 
censorship 
in henry county ga for example about 100 students picketed 
the school superintendents office last month when dozens of boys 
were sent home because their hair touched the collar in violation of 
a new policy 
the same rule in jasper ala resulted in an angry school board 
meeting 
shelia whitfield whose son duane a 10thgrader was sent home 
because his hair is an inch longer than allowed complained the rule 
was an invasion of privacy 
his hair doesnt have anything to do with his education mrs 
whitfield said 
new dress codes are in effect in several texas school systems 
mostly to guard against offensive or suggestive tshirts and in 
baltimore where furs costly jewelry and leather coats were banned 
dozens of other systems including some in michigan new york and 
louisiana have adopted voluntary dress codes for their schools to 
consider 
gary marx a spokesman for the american association of school 
administrators said stricter dress and hair codes have not yet 
become a national trend but sentiment is growing to strengthen such 
rules 
we do see indications here and there that schools are thinking 
about dress codes and how students are attired may affect their 
education and the education of others marx said i think there 
is a sense in society that we sometimes act the way we look 
lawrence tribe a harvard university law professor who 
specializes in first amendment issues said the us supreme court 
has never dealt directly with the issue and the lower federal courts 
have ruled both ways 
the high court would likely side with school boards if it ruled 
today he said 
i think it stretches the free expression clause to apply it in 
schools tribe said the power of compulsory education already 
involves a major intrusion into a persons ability to express 
himself the school board has a broad range of powers over its 
students 
in baltimore schools spokesman dick holden said the new code 
was aimed at eliminating the uniform of the drug culture he 
said the clothes also are too expensive for some students to afford 
leading to violence 
the dress code became a major topic of discussion after some 
violent incidents in our schools involving outsiders stealing or 
attempting to steal jackets or jewelry of our students holden 
said clothing had become attractions to criminal activity 
the new orleans school board instituted a voluntary uniform 
policy for schools and spokeswoman rose peterson said about 100 
schools have adopted some kind of uniform 
she cited three reasons its a security issue when the 
schools are wearing a uniform its easy to recognize an outsider 
for the parents they perceive it as a lot cheaper and it takes the 
pressure off kids to wear designer clothes 
in clovis nm a oneyear trial dress code is in effect after 
students rewrote an old one that banned shorts for boys but allowed 
miniskirts for girls in protest some boys wore miniskirts to 
school 
the new policy allows shorts and skirts if neither is shorter 
than 5 inches above the knee 
and in san antonio a 13yearold student was forced to get rid 
of two batman emblems emblazoned on each side of his head with 
bleach officials banned him from class until he came back with a 
flattop 
among students though opinions can be divided 
many see the restrictions as arbitrary and others worry that 
some adults assume a given style of dress means a student is taking 
drugs or involved in illegal activity 
still others including student body president jason thompson of 
allen high school in dallas support policies encouraging neat 
appearance 
fads come and go thompson said last year when stud 
earrings were allowed for the first time almost everyone went out 
and got his ear pierced but now you dont see earrings that much

the farmers almanac renewing its crusade 
to revamp the nations coinage and currency is promoting a 1 coin 
to replace the dollar bill to pinch a few pennies for uncle sam and 
taxpayers 
the almanacs 1990 edition just off the presses also calls for 
the elimination of the penny and 50cent piece the new 1 coin 
could be called the columbus dollar honoring the explorer who 
discovered the new world the publication said 
the almanac endorses a bill introduced by rep jim kolbe 
rariz to direct the treasury to mint and circulate the columbus 
dollar and halt production of the 1 bill 18 months after the coin 
is placed in circulation 
under the new system the littleused 2 bill likely would become 
the most popular piece of currency says almanac editor ray geiger 
geiger maintains that the new system would create a coinage and 
currency system that reflects contemporary values and lifestyles 
he quotes the federal reserve as saying replacement of the 1 
bill by the 1 coin would save the treasury more than 120 million a 
year 
it costs approximately 26 cents to print a 1 bill and the 
bill lasts about 18 months before it goes to the shredder it costs 
3 cents to mint a 1 coin but the coin will last 20 years he 
said 
the farmers almanac 173 years old has always been a champion 
of the common man and we think the common man is entitled to 
protect his right to a coinage thats sensible and realistic he 
said in an interview 
geigers publication not to be confused with the 197yearold 
new hampshirebased old farmers almanac has previously prodded the 
government to restore city names to postmarks eliminate the 
ninedigit zip code and print currency in colors other than green 
geiger who claims a circulation of more than 5 million said 
this years 48page almanac contains the usual mix of calendar data 
household hints oneline jokes and inspirational messages 
it also has weather predictions by prognosticator caleb 
weatherbee that are based on a secret formula based on sunspots 
the position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon 
weatherbee predicts that the winter of 198990 will be milder 
than usual with less snow while next summer will be pleasant with 
moderate rainfall 
the campaign for the 1 coin follows last years proposal for a 
new coin worth 12 cents or one bit as geiger saw it the bit 
would bridge the gap between the dime and quarter that suggestion 
didnt catch on 
but the almanac remains adamant that the penny has got to go 
saying most of the 200 billion in circulation simply gather dust in 
shoe boxes and piggy banks it suggests that sales be rounded off to 
the nearest nickel 
on the 1 coin geiger said the susan b anthony dollar coin 
failed to become popular because it was not easily distinguished 
from the quarter and because it was introduced as an alternative to 
the paper dollar rather than a replacement 
the almanac even has a design ready for a new 1 coin art 
director ed greenwood drew a sample coin that features a portrait of 
the explorer on one side and two of his ships on the other 
the almanac suggests that the coin be gold toned 1 inches in 
diameter ungrooved or unribbed on the edges with the thickness of 
a quarter it would also be light 015 ounce or onequarter the 
weight of the old silver dollar

the governor reluctantly signed legislation to 
repeal the nations only premarital aidstesting requirement 
acknowledging that in 1 years only 52 aids cases were found among 
the 250000 tests 
lawmakers health officials and civil rights organizations 
applauded republican gov james r thompsons action monday 
it was infringing on peoples civil liberties was detrimental 
to the public health and had very little benefit said john 
hammell director of the aids and civil liberties project of the 
illinois american civil liberties union 
were talking about tens of thousands who changed marriage 
plans or went out of state 
the illinois state medical society also congratulated thompson on 
signing the bill and said counseling and education is more 
effective in stopping the spread of aids than is mass testing the 
society represents 18000 physicians 
the repeal effective immediately also removed a longstanding 
requirement that prospective spouses be tested for syphilis 
that means couples will no longer be required to take premarital 
blood tests to get a marriage license in illinois as they had been 
since the syphilis measure was passed in 1938 said mary huck a 
spokeswoman for the state department of public health 
the repeal bill provides for the department to develop a brochure 
on sexually transmitted diseases that would be distributed to 
couples applying for marriage licenses thompson said the provision 
would help achieve the objectives of the original bill 
the law required couples seeking a marriage license to show a 
doctors certification that they had been tested for the disease 
illinois had been the only state in the nation to mandate 
premarital aids tests louisiana enacted and then repealed a similar 
law last year 
the illinois requirement was approved in june 1987 over the 
objections of the state public health director dr bernard turnock 
whose confirmation was blocked for weeks by lawmakers angered by his 
opposition 
we were simply penalizing the citizens of illinois and 
requiring them to do some unproductive medical research for us 
said rep grace mary stern a sponsor of the repeal 
the cost of an aids test ranging from 20 to 150 per person 
was blamed for a sharp drop in the number of marriage licenses 
issued in illinois from nearly 100000 in 1987 to fewer than 80000 
last year 
counties along the state line reported the sharpest declines 
while counties in neighboring states experienced sharp increases 
for example wisconsins kenosha county issued 1142 marriage 
licenses to illinoisans in 1988 compared with 67 a year earlier 
thompson said the repeal decision was difficult but necessary 
since the program turned up only 52 cases of 250000 tests 
its pretty clear people were going to neighboring states 
thompson said what we were doing was in fact alienating people

officials today said prince aya the secondinline 
to the throne will take as his bride a college student whose humble 
background gave her the nickname apartment princess 
the announcement by the imperial household council came a day 
after kiko kawashimashe celebrated her 23rd birthday with the 
prince the emperor and empress at akasaka palace a far grander 
home than the simple apartment where she lives with her parents 
prince ayas choice of his college sweetheart who has no noble 
background and whose family is welloff but not wealthy has caused 
a stir among some palace conservatives 
it will be hard for her because she is the closest person to 
the general public ever to marry into the royal family said one 
palace source who requested anonymity empress michiko may have 
been a commoner but her family was certainly upper class 
michiko the first commoner to become empress reportedly helped 
deflect opposition to the marriage 
the idea of 23yearold aya marrying before his 29yearold 
brother naruhito also had met considerable opposition from palace 
conservatives another palace source said 
but the crown prince seems to be in no hurry and hasnt found 
the right woman yet the source said earlier this month 
requesting anonymity 
the plans were announced after the 10member imperial household 
council headed by prime minister toshiki kaifu met this morning 
together with the people of japan i express my salutations 
regarding this auspicious engagement and pray for the continued and 
increased prosperity of the imperial family kiko has a 
wonderful personality and is a most fitting princess kaifu told 
reporters after the announcement 
although prince aya chose his bride himself by law the council 
has to meet to discuss the marriage of any male member of the 
imperial family 
in sharp contrast to the empress whose family business is the 
nations largest flour miller miss kawashima lives with her parents 
and younger brother in humble oncampus housing at tokyos gakushuin 
university where she studies psychology and her father tatsuhiko 
teaches economics 
that university however is the alma mater of much of japans 
royalty including aya and the emperor 
aya 23 is secondinline to the chrysanthemum throne after 
naruhito who will be formally installed as crown prince next year 
on a date yet to be decided 
aya will complete postgraduate studies in zoology at oxford 
universitys st johns college in june 
no date has been set for ceremonies related to the wedding but 
they will not be held until after jan 7 when a oneyear mourning 
period marking the death of the late emperor hirohito ends 
hirohito who died at age 87 is ayas grandfather 
once the mourning period is over an imperial envoy will be sent 
to the kawashima residence to present her family with gifts rice 
wine fish and red and white silks that future imperial inlaws 
traditionally receive 
the gifts seal the engagement much as a ring would in the west 
after the presents are given miss kawashima will begin 
princess studies daily classes in imperial history and customs 
the constitution foreign language and etiquette

the reputed money man behind colombias medellin 
cocaine cartel has been denied bail after pleading innocent to 
moneylaundering charges 
eduardo martinez romero the first of colombias 
extraditables brought to the united states without trial is 
accused of helping the cartel launder about 12 billion in drug 
profits through us banks 
the cartel based in the colombian city of medellin is believed 
to supply 80 percent of the cocaine in the united states 
during an arraignment monday us magistrate joel m feldman 
ordered martinez held without bond after prosecutors contended he 
was likely to flee the country before a trial 
assistant us attorney wilmer parker iii told feldman that 
martinez could easily afford to lose whatever bond amount was set to 
ensure his return 
defense lawyers ed garland and oscar rodriguez said the 
36yearold martinez was a highly educated businessman with a loving 
wife and four children 
the defense attorneys asking the judge to place martinez under 
house arrest pending his trial said he had never come to the united 
states to set up moneylaundering arrangements they said he had 
only been in the country to bring his children to disney world 
parker noted that martinez escaped an arrest attempt in panama in 
march shortly after his indictment by a federal grand jury in 
atlanta 
the indictment was a result of a 2year investigation dubbed 
operation polar cap which led to charges against 127 people and two 
latin american banks 
rodriguez said martinez is being held in solitary confinement at 
an undisclosed location which is believed to be in the atlanta area 
if convicted martinez could receive 30 years in prison under 
colombian law or life under us law garland said it is not yet 
clear which law applies

a cuban exile who led 1500 men in the 1961 bay of 
pigs invasion then spent 28 years deeply depressed over the defeat 
was found dead after an apparent suicide 
jose alfredo perez san roman 58 was found dead sunday morning 
in his mobile home where he lived alone police were analyzing the 
handwriting on a suicide note and awaiting autopsy results monday 
before they would announce the cause said metrodade police 
spokesman george reyes 
roman led the 1500man brigade of cuban exiles in the abortive 
usbacked assault on their island homeland in april 1961 they 
were defeated by troops loyal to the communist government of fidel 
castro who had seized power in 1959 after dictator fulgencio 
batista fled amid guerrilla fighting 
san romans brother roberto perez said the bay of pigs defeat 
and the failure to liberate cuba haunted his brother 
the cuban invasion was his life his reason for living perez 
said afterward it was very difficult for him to cope with the 
political upheaval of exile 
col ramon j ferrermena san romans chief of staff in the 
invasion said the commander took the humiliating defeat personally 
and didnt accept the missions failure even as it collapsed around 
the small exile invasion force 
the first thing i thought when i got off the phone from hearing 
that pepe was dead was that it was a suicide said ferrermena 
san roman was one of 1189 exiles captured and imprisoned in cuba 
after the invasion the exiles were returned to the united states 19 
months later and ransomed by president kennedy for 53 million in 
food and medicine 
like most of the bay of pigs veterans san roman felt betrayed by 
the united states for not providing vital air and sea military 
support said mario cabello a veteran of the invasion 
robert kennedy the thenattorney general said san roman told 
him after he was liberated from cuba that 10 times as many troops 
would have been needed to succeed 
veterans of brigade 2506 still meet in miami and discuss what 
might have been 
san roman was honored as a hero in the exile community said col 
humberto olivera another bay of pigs veteran 
during his trial he behaved as a commander said olivera 
he never said no and he was a man who faced a firing squad and 
never turned his back on his principles he was a brilliant man 
olivera said san roman was an honor student and graduate of 
managua military academy the cuban equivalent of west point he 
also was one of the youngest captains in the cuban army olivera 
said

after three months of propaganda and political 
study about the crushed prodemocracy movement beijing residents 
views of the protests still are split along generational lines 
most of the leaders of the sevenweek movement that ended in 
bloodshed in june were college students 
wuer kaixi the charismatic leader who fled to the united 
states is 21 the average age of the 21 students on chinas most 
wanted list of student leaders is 23 
students say the older generation was so cowed by years of 
oppression that it dared not support the students 
an intellectual in his late 60s said recently of the current 
crackdown on dissent theyre not paying too much attention to us 
oldsters this time its the young ones 
the intellectual who like the others spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the leadership probably believes the older 
generation supports the government line which calls the democracy 
movement a counterrevolutionary rebellion that sought to topple the 
government 
regardless of what they think they know we wouldnt have the 
guts to do what the students did he said 
troops killed hundreds of civlians on june 34 as they put down 
the popular movement since then all chinese are forced to undergo 
weekly political study sessions at their work units and college 
students this fall have had several weeks of intensive political 
study 
the students were the inspiration and the force behind the 
movement that was joined by hundreds of thousands of ordinary 
citizens most in their 20s or 30s 
they are a generation that has grown up with only dim memories of 
the horrors of the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution and for 
whom the rigidity and purges of the 1950s and early 1960s are 
history 
for the youth the past 10 years of opening to the outside world 
have been the most vivid and they have welcomed what foreigners 
have brought to china from the ideals of democracy freedom and 
human rights to western cigarettes fancy clothes and rocknroll 
a beijing university student who actively participated in the 
movement spoke impatiently of his parents and their generation who 
he said were afraid of the changes he and his friends sought 
he said that his parents were afraid to even think about what 
we were saying much less support or even take part in the 
movement because of their experiences with chinas rapidly changing 
political winds 
the old intellectual who has repeatedly been persecuted during 
chinas frequent political campaigns tried to dissuade young 
friends and colleagues from even going to see what was happening in 
tiananmen square 
many older chinese forbade their teenage and collegeage 
children to go out during the protests because they have learned it 
is best not to get involved in political affairs 
at beijing university recently a senior advised a foreigner 
talking to school security personnel not to ask too many questions 
about what happened this spring 
the older folks they dont think like us they dont 
understand he said if you ask too many pointed questions of 
them they may get you in trouble 
the old intellectual asked if he thought what the students did 
was right said you ask me what is correct and what isnt but 
i cant tell you 
the beijing university student however had no doubts at all 
while regretting the high price that was paid he said what we 
did was right 
others students echo his words even three months after the 
crackdown and after weeks of intensive political education at 
school but they also say they get no support from their parents for 
their activities 
a senior at a technical school said that when he went home in 
late may after taking part in the hunger strike his parents forbade 
him to return to beijing and told him the students were foolish to 
think they could change anything

a defense lawyer said he does not plan 
to challenge blood samples and other physical evidence that 
incriminate ramon salcido in seven slayings during a wine country 
rampage 
but marteen miller said monday he will seek to disqualify 
salcidos confession to mexican authorities on the grounds that it 
was not voluntary 
miller outlined his strategy following the first day of a 
preliminary examination to determine if there is enough evidence to 
hold salcido over for trial 
salcido 28 who has pleaded innocent to the charges is accused 
of killing his wife two daughters his motherinlaw and her two 
daughters and a coworker on april 14 he also is accused of 
attempting to murder his third daughter another coworker and the 
colleagues wife 
during the hearing a sheriffs deputy fought tears when asked to 
identify a photograph of salcidos daughters found with their 
throats slashed in a dump 
sonoma county sheriffs deputy mike mcmanus the first officer to 
arrive at the grisly scene spoke haltingly as he described finding 
the bodies of sofia 4 and teresa 1 lying near their sister 
carmina then 2 who survived 
also testifying was richard waller of the california department 
of justice laboratory who said blood found on the body of salcidos 
motherinlaw marion richards and her 12yearold daughter ruth 
appeared to be salcidos 
the finding also linked to salcido a blood sample found on a 
22caliber semiautomatic pistol used in at least two of the 
shootings said waller 
after the hearing assistant district attorney peter bumerts 
called the physical evidence as conclusive as it gets 
i dont think this is a whodoneit and i dont think mr 
miller has ever indicated it would be said bumerts 
municipal judge knoel owen denied a defense motion to continue 
the hearing for 30 days to assure the appearance of two special 
agents with the us drug enforcement administration who were with 
salcido when he was arrested by mexican authorities five days after 
the rampage 
salcido told the agents he killed his wife and a coworker in a 
jealous rage believing they were romantically involved authorities 
have said 
miller accused the mexican authorities of coercing salcidos 
confession the defense attorney said it would take 30 days for 
authorities in washington dc to ensure the agents appearance 
owen said he would reconsider millers motion if at the end of 
the preliminary hearing the agents have not testified 
the hearing is expected to last two weeks

if a jury believes larry robertson 
had honey smacks in his cereal bowl he could spend the rest of his 
life in prison but if it was froot loops he could go free 
robertsons attorney has stirred up this confusion in an effort 
to clear his client a fourtime convicted felon 
robertson 25 is charged with stealing a rifle and a box of 
cereal from a house in lake worth on oct 15 
the victim said the pilfered cereal was sugar smacks the puffs 
of wheat since renamed honey smacks but a neighbor claims he saw 
the thief wearing a red shirt and blue shorts carrying an m16 rifle 
and box of froot loops 
police never located the rifle but found robertson around the 
corner wearing a red shirt blue shorts and eating a bowl of cereal 
robertson said he was eating froot loops police said they saw 
a puffedrice type of cereal and charged him with burglary and 
grand theft 
we all know cereal gets soggy after a minute or two and it 
loses its identity said robertsons attorney michael lebedeker 
my defense is that the victim said sugar smacks and the 
witness saw froot loops 
when assistant state attorney mark hanson heard about the froot 
loop defense he facetiously named two new witnesses toucan sam 
the cartoon mascot on froot loops cereal commercials and digem 
the hyperkinetic frog for honey smacks 
if digem identifies sugar smacks then there goes his 
defense the prosecutor said 
robertson also is accused of robbing and stabbing a milkman oct 
6 if he is found guilty of the attack and the burglary at his oct 
23 trial he could be sentenced as a career criminal to a life term 
hanson said 
im just going to eat my wheaties and lucky charms and hope the 
jury does the right thing hanson said then hell have more 
than spilled milk to cry about

paul gann who helped lead the 
proposition 13 tax revolt in the 70s and fought a losing battle for 
criminal penalties for those who knowingly spread aids died from 
the effects of the disease he was 77 
the selfproclaimed peoples advocate who continued fighting 
for ceilings on government spending into the 1980s died monday of 
pneumonia complicated by a problem with the aids virus said 
ted costa his longtime political aide 
gann had been under treatment for a broken hip at the kaiser 
permanente medical center since a fall at his home on sept 2 he 
said he contracted aids from blood received during openheart 
surgery in 1982 before blood screening for the aids virus had been 
developed 
gann cowrote the property taxslashing proposition 13 initiative 
in 1978 with the late howard jarvis 
gov george deukmejian called gann a tireless crusader on 
behalf of lower taxes fiscal responsibility and good government 
paul and howard jarvis will be remembered for leading the 
modernday version of the boston tea party which culminated in the 
overwhelming approval of proposition 13 the republican governor 
said 
the state senate adjourned in ganns memory the assembly had 
left for the day before his death 
proposition 13 which cut california property taxes by 57 
percent sparked a national trend of taxcutting movements in other 
states in 1979 gann successfully sponsored another voters 
petition drive that set limits on state and local government 
spending 
during two decades of crusading in california gann sponsored or 
coauthored 12 ballot initiatives for conservative causes dealing 
with taxes crime aids and public salaries 
the june 1990 ballot will include a proposal sponsored by 
deukmejian and leaders of both parties to modify the gann limit 
on state spending to allow enactment of an 185million 10year 
transportation package 
in his only bid for elective office gann won the republican 
nomination for the us senate in 1980 but was crushed by 47 
million to 3 million votes by incumbent democrat alan cranston in 
the general election 
gann first announced he had aids on june 9 1987 when he 
declared that his fight against aids would be the last campaign of 
my life 
after the announcement gann fought for criminal prosecution of 
people who knowingly spread aids and mandatory reporting of the 
names of people who test positive for the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
i feel i have the gravest responsibility to accomplish this 
more so than anything ive ever done actually gann said of his 
war on aids during a 1988 interview 
voters in californias 1988 election rejected the measure

the dollar dropped sharply against the japanese yen 
today while the tokyo stock exchanges key index bounced back after 
a weeklong decline 
after losses totaling more than 370 points over five trading 
days the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues climbed 21922 
points or 064 percent tuesday and closed at 3433288 
market players were reassured by the yens overnight recovery in 
new york dealers said 
the dollar plunged in new york monday after a rumor that the us 
federal reserve board planned an emergency meeting to ease monetary 
policy 
the yens rebound helped bond prices to rise which also 
encouraged market players to buy stocks said masahiro umemori a 
stock analyst with nomura securities 
trading was thin however with first section volume estimated at 
500 million shares among gainers were electrical shipbuilding and 
construction issues 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14673 yen down 104 
yen from mondays finish of 14777 yen its highest close in nearly 
three months it opened at 14680 yen and ranged between 14660 yen 
and 14693 yen 
after opening sharply lower following its overnight plunge in new 
york the dollar moved little in tokyo said yoshitsugu hanada a 
trader with mitsui bank 
although some market sources had expected the dollar to fall 
further during tokyo trading it didnt mainly because many 
investment trust companies bought the currency whenever it moved 
lower he said 
but the dollar could fall some more considering many market 
players still have long dollarholding positions he said 
he said the bank of japans dollarselling intervention which 
totaled some 400 million today also was likely to check the 
dollars rise 
the bank of japan does not comment on its exchange market 
activities 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a trader at daiwa bank said however that 
expectations of a strong dollar persisted despite the temporary fall 
hanada said there was little news to prompt major moves by market 
players who were awaiting the release of us retail price figures 
for august on thursday and trade figures for july on friday

the state intends to begin its own oil 
spill cleanup after exxon removes the last of its crews this week 
from the fouled coastline of prince william sound and the gulf of 
alaska 
david ramseur a spokesman for gov steve cowper said the 
details are still being worked out but the governor will agree to a 
statefinanced cleanup to begin after exxon withdraws friday 
cowper plans to announce the plan in valdez home port of the 
tanker exxon valdez which ran aground march 24 on a charted reef 
spilling nearly 11 millions gallons of alaska crude in the nations 
worst oil spill 
he will spend the next few days working with the state department 
of environmental conservation figuring out what kind of cleanup the 
state should attempt during alaskas stormy dark and frigid winter 
were looking at some light manual cleanup picking up 
remaining tar balls and funding some research and development that 
goes beyond squirting hot water on rocks ramseur said 
the governors office had no estimate monday of how much its 
cleanup might cost press aide ernie piper said the state was 
confident that based on exxons past willingness to pay its oil 
spill bills the company also would cover the cost of the states 
wintertime cleanup 
exxon estimates its expenses for the summer cleanup at more than 
12 billion and disputes state and federal agencies claims that 
the cleanup has been inadequate the company says it has treated 
more than 1000 miles of shoreline leaving only four miles undone 
state authorities say exxon is overstating the work it has done 
and is quitting before the job is finished 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly has 
defended exxons decision to leave for the winter but said the oil 
company must finish the cleanup next spring or pay the government to 
do the job 
in san diego meanwhile shipyard workers cut pieces of steel off 
the bottom of the exxon valdez on monday as repairs started on the 
tanker the repairs at national steel and shipbuilding co where 
the ship is in dry dock will take about nine months and cost an 
estimated 25 million

for days people stood in line by the 
hundreds in materialscarce poland to pay about 13 months wages 
just for the chance to buy a prefabricated house within the next 
four years 
i prefer this to waiting 15 years for an apartment at a housing 
cooperative one man told state radio monday when shares in the 
project went on sale 
realization of a dream read the newspaper advertisement 
placed by the privatelyowned drewbud bank which offered shares 
that would entitle some lucky stockholders to buy a house by 1993 
the company said it would also give away 100 free houses annually 
to stockholders 
the company is making the first largescale effort to sell houses 
in poland an effort that reflects hopes that through fundamental 
economic reform engendered by a truly representative government a 
solution might finally be found for the countrys desperate housing 
shortage 
drewbud is not selling finished houses however just the 
prefabricated pieces needed to put them together 
the housing situation is so dire in poland that just the chance 
of being able to buy the elements of a house drew hopeful crowds to 
the 11 banks nationwide where the 15000 shares went on sale some 
people stood in line as long as four days 
each share entitles its owner to enter one drawing for the free 
houses and another to set the order in which the prefabricated 
houses will be sold 
the price for a share in the poznanbased company was 2 million 
zlotys about 222 at the freemarket exchange rate 
the average monthly salary is about 150000 zlotys an income 
poles find they must supplement with cash earned on the side or with 
hard currency obtained from relatives abroad or by working in the 
west several months a year 
currently the homes drewbud is offering cost an estimated 
180000 zloties per square meter or about 3160 for a 
158squaremeter twobedroom plan 
however there is no accurate estimate of what the houses will 
cost when sold the inflation rate was 40 percent for last month and 
is thought to be edging toward 200 percent annually 
the price does not include the property the cost of assembling 
the house or providing connections to power water and sewage 
systems 
nor does it include a furnace plumbing or any other fittings 
such as floor tile or appliances 
the advertisement included two pages of plans for 10 styles of 
homes from rowhouses to manor style 
the plans appealed to those facing often decadeslong waits for 
the more typical residence which are two or three tiny rooms in a 
worn apartment block 
a government report citing severe shortages in almost all 
building materials high cost and government bureaucracy said 
housing construction will be 30000 units below projections this 
year 
the difficulty of obtaining materials as well as red tape and 
expense also stalls private efforts to build homes 
the report issued this week said the efficiency of housing 
construction approaches that of the late 1960s it said the problem 
is aggravated by the lack of hard currency with which to buy 
materials and equipment in the west 
but drewbud promised homes that were ones own healthy 
energysaving made of natural materials and easy to assemble 
the sale was advertised to last for five days by monday 
afternoon 250 of the 1150 shares available at the warsaw bank 
branch had been sold

the possibility of a mistrial in the nearly 
6yearold mcmartin preschool molestation case became more likely 
with the final alternate juror replacing an ailing member of the 
panel 
we are a heartbeat away from a mistrial superior court judge 
william pounders said monday 
pounders said he is desperately concerned about getting the 
case to the jury soon if one more juror drops out the case would 
have to be mistried because it would lack the required 12 votes 
pounders said the stress of the trial has taken its toll on 
jurors health there originally were six alternates 
the excused juror suffers from a blood disorder his physician 
said could prove fatal if he continued to serve 
the pressure is too much for the jury pounders said we 
have 12 healthy jurors right now that should be able to stay with 
us but the minute that one of them is gone weve lost 2 years of 
effort 
raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a joint count of 
conspiracy prosecutors allege they molested 11 children at their 
family owned mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach seven teachers 
originally were charged in the case which has lingered in the 
courts nearly six years charges against the others were dismissed 
despite his desire to end the case quickly pounders granted a 
prosecution request to present nine more witnesses in their rebuttal 
case 
it feels to me to be a clear gamble to present evidence like 
this he said noting the longer the case the greater likelihood 
of a mistrial 
i feel like we are in las vegas rolling the dice he said 
and i lose in las vegas i feel like we are going to lose it 
but pounders said he granted the prosecution request for more 
testimony because he blames the defense for prolonging what is now 
the longest and costliest criminal trial in american history 
the vast majority of time has been taken by the defense in this 
case he said 
he summoned the remaining jurors and told them their absent 
colleague was ill with a blood disease and with shingles the latter 
disease is contagious but he told them if they were going to 
contract it you would have had it by now 
these are the 12 jurors who will decide this case he said 
so your participation is vital until the conclusion of the trial 
the trial has been plagued by jury illnesses pounders frequently 
has called recesses when jurors had to keep doctor appointments at 
one point he recessed for several weeks to allow a juror to have 
spinal surgery

a freighter carrying bales of newsprint 
and canned food for the besieged christian enclave ran the syrian 
blockade today as syrian and christian gunners fought a shelling 
duel in and around beirut 
police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in the 
overnight duel which escalated at 330 am as the princesshand 
entered lebanese territorial waters about 20 miles north of beirut 
by police count the sixmonth confrontation between gen michel 
aouns mainly christian troops and the syrian army has claimed the 
lives of 847 people and left 2528 wounded 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said the syrians opened up at the princesshand using 
radarcontrolled 130mm howitzers deployed north of the christian 
enclave 
the ship he said sailed very close to the 
christiancontrolled coast as shells exploded around it but made it 
safely to the port of jounieh and dropped anchor at 430 am he 
said further details about the ships nationality and agents were 
not available 
however the spokesman said the bales of newsprint were imported 
by three newspapers operating in christian east beirut he did not 
elaborate 
east beirut and the rest of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
northeast of the capital has been besieged by the syrians for more 
that six months in retaliation for a blockade imposed by aoun on 
ports run by syrias militia allies south of beirut 
syrian gunboats have intercepted several ships trying to defy the 
blockade and several vessels have been hit by syrian shellfire as 
they approached christian ports most such attacks have not been 
reported 
the daily newspaper annahar published a study released by the 
governmentrun maritime transport directorate which said 27 ships 
have been affected by the syrian blockade of christian waters which 
has killed 14 seamen and wounded five 
the study said five of the ships were set ablaze by syrian 
shelling six suffered direct shell hits 11 were hit by shrapnel 
and five were intercepted by syrian gunboats and taken to 
syriancontrolled ports 
meanwhile lebanese newspapers predicted that a truce in the 
syrianchristian confrontation would result from a meeting by a 
threeman arab mediation committee scheduled for wednesday in saudi 
arabia 
annahar said aoun has agreed to the idea forming a team to 
monitor the import of weapons by the warring lebanese factions an 
issue which has been a sticking point 
the syrians claim iraq their arab arch rival is providing aoun 
with weapons and ammunitions by sea 
the 54yearold maronite catholic general has repeatedly refused 
proposals for the formation of a team of observers to monitor the 
28mile christiancontrolled stretch of lebanons 130mile 
mediterranean coast 
aouns reported acceptance of an observation team which could 
not be officially verified is expected to facilitate efforts of the 
mediation committee which comprises the foreign ministers of saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria 
the three chief diplomats after wednesdays meeting are to 
report to their leaders on the possibility of stabilizing the 
situation in lebanon 
kind fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and algerian 
president chadli bendjedid were asked by a fullfledged arab summit 
in may to find a settlement by november to lebanons 14yearold 
civil war 
however the mediation committee announced july 28 that its 
efforts on lebanon were deadlocked and blamed syria for blocking its 
mission 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of betraying 
their 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22nation arab league by 
siding with moslems against christians in the civil war which has 
taken more than 150000 lives

a former aide to the late mayor harold washington 
delivered an hourlong speech protesting his innocence but was 
sentenced to eight years in prison for his conviction on fraud and 
racketeering charges 
clarence mcclain also was ordered monday to pay 35000 in 
restitution and placed on five years probation 
mcclain 48 was convicted in july of racketeering fraud and tax 
evasion for taking 35000 in bribes from undercover fbi informant 
michael raymond 
during the sentencing hearing monday mcclain repeatedly handed 
us district judge ilana rovner documents that he said would prove 
his innocence and castigated the prosecution and news media who 
created this diabolical event 
mcclain who did not take the stand at his bribery trial accused 
federal prosecutors of suppressing tapes he said would have cleared 
him he said he would call for a congressional investigation of his 
prosecution which was part of the fbis operation incubator probe 
of corruption in city government 
mcclain became so agitated during his speech that ms rovner 
ordered a fiveminute recess so he could calm down 
assistant us attorney michael shepard told the judge that 
mcclains speech was one more reason why she should not consider 
leniency 
shepard said mcclain would not subject himself to 
crossexamination but could not resist a chance to rant and rave 
in front of an audience as if a trial had not occurred 
mcclain was accused of accepting bribes from raymond and the 
president of a new yorkbased company in exchange for using his 
influence to make sure the company systematic recovery services 
got a lucrative city contract for retrieving delinquent parking 
fines 
clarence mcclain traded harold washingtons dream of reform for 
cash and he put it in his own pocket shepard said 
mcclain served as an aide to washington when he was a state 
representative and a member of the illinois congressional 
delegation but was dismissed by the mayor shortly after his 1983 
election when reports surfaced about mcclains prior criminal 
record which included a conviction for pandering 
mcclain reportedly told raymond and others that he still had the 
ear of the mayor and could direct bribes in washingtons direction 
raymond a convicted swindler was the central figure in the 
undercover investigation operation incubator netted 16 convictions 
in chicago and spawned a a probe in new york city that led to 10 
convictions including that of stanley m friedman democratic 
chairman of the bronx 
raymond agreed to serve as an undercover fbi operative after 
being arrested on weapons charges in nashville tenn in 1984

chinese officials today welcomed the first soviet 
parliamentary delegation to visit since the two countries normalized 
relations in may 
the sixmember supreme soviet delegation led by anatoly 
lukyanov vice president of the bodys presidium will be in china 
for six days and is also to tour wuhan and shanghai soviet 
officials said 
it is the first parliamentary group to come to china since 
mikhail s gorbachev normalized party and government ties in a may 
visit the first by a soviet leader to china in 30 years 
gorbachevs trip was overshadowed by massive prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
since the movement was suppressed in a bloody june 34 military 
assault china has emphasized its good ties with communist and third 
world countries which unlike the west have generally withheld 
criticism of the use of violence to put down the protests 
the head of chinas communist party international liaison 
department zhu liang is currently in moscow to discuss ways to 
develop interparty ties following the gorbachev visit 
sinosoviet relations were frozen at most party and government 
levels after a 1960 split over ideological and strategic 
differences and did not begin to thaw until the mid1980s 
the first supreme soviet visit to china after the split took 
place in 1985 there have been two more lowerlevel parliamentary 
visits before the current delegation

chancellor helmut kohl has weathered 
a storm inside his party and won another term as christian 
democratic union leader but with the smallest majority of votes in 
his 16 years as party chairman 
kohl was elected to the new term late monday and will be the 
partys candidate for chancellor again during next years tough 
election battle 
but the 59yearold kohl who will be angling for a third term as 
head of the bonn government managed just 77 percent support from 
his own party faithful despite having no opponent in the vote for 
the chairmanship 
the sizeable novote expressed the discord within the kohls 
party after numerous local election losses over the past two years 
as the west german electorate has moved to the left the 
traditionally conservative christian democrats have drifted toward 
the center angering their most rightwing members while doing 
little to win votes from the left 
kohl last month fired the partys longtime manager heiner 
geissler triggering another intraparty dispute that reared its head 
monday on the national party conventions opening day 
geissler architect of the partys comeback at the beginning of 
the 1980s initially disputed his firing by claiming it signaled a 
move by the christian democrats in the wrong political direction 
in an effort to put a unified face on party affairs heading into 
the national election campaign kohl offered geissler a job as 
deputy chairman of the party one of eight and geissler was voted 
into that seat monday night 
but some notes of discontent were voiced by moderates among the 
750 party delegates at the convention who saw kohls removal of 
geissler as highhanded or an act of desperation 
the christian democrats are currently running neckandneck with 
the leftleaning social democrats in public opinion polls which 
give each party about 38 percent of the vote 
that means the christian democrats need to retain a coalition 
with the liberal free democratic party and with their bavarian 
sister party the christian social union to win a majority in 
december 1990 national balloting 
the free democrats which poll about 8 percent in national 
surveys have indicated they will make their continued alliance 
dependent on how the christian democrats fare in regional elections 
over the next few months 
christian democrat losses this year in berlin and frankfurt cost 
the party control of those cities 
free democrat support among voters has also withered over the 
past year and the party blames its drop on the declining popularity 
of the christian democrats with which it is aligned in bonn 
continued discord within the christian democratic party 
reflected in the fact that kohl won only 571 of 738 votes for the 
chairmanship could further erode the partys popularity and its 
chances for retaining leadership of the bonn government next year

what was supposed to have been a flyby of the new 
boeing 737500 for its customers turned into a flybehind 
the new jet flanked in tight formation by a 737300 and a 
737400 was scheduled monday to fly in front of the guests waiting 
at the museum of flight at boeing field but the jets flew over the 
building and behind the spectators 
im not sure what happened said dick schleh a boeing 
commercial airplanes spokesman i think the pilots of the planes 
believed they were to fly over the building and not over the 
runway 
some guests did catch a glimpse of the formation although the 
sun was directly overhead at the time schleh said 
some people saw most of the first plane half of the second and 
none of the third he said with a laugh 
the guests included officials of major customers for the 737500 
including southwest airlines braathens euralair and maersk 
the 737500 boeings smallest commercial jet was first flown on 
june 30 and is aimed at the same market as the 737200 which first 
flew in 1967 and ended production in 1988 
the 500series planes which sell for 24 million to 28 million 
apiece carry about the same number of passengers as the 200 series 
but can save 20 percent of the fuel

researchers at brookhaven national 
laboratory have created energy using a new method for 
hightemperature nuclear fusion that may have the potential for 
producing a clean and efficient form of nuclear energy 
i would classify this as a new approach that has not been tried 
by anybody else before there may be promise dr robert beuhler 
a chemist at the laboratory on new yorks long island said monday 
he said the new method involves the firing of a cluster of up to 
1300 fuel molecules at a stationary fuel target the resulting 
compression causes atoms from the cluster and the target to fuse 
producing a small burst of nuclear energy 
we were quite surprised beuhler said on behalf of himself 
senior chemist dr lewis friedman and another colleague dr gerhart 
friedlander 
but the researchers enthusiasm was tempered by the realization 
that it would take years of further work to verify whether fusion 
can be achieved on a much larger scale 
this is very new ground beuhler said 
beuhler said the method produces a small burst of nuclear energy 
only once in every 10 billion times it is tried 
the work to create nuclear fusion began in the spring financed 
by the federal energy department cluster research at brookhaven has 
gone on for more than a decade 
the findings were accepted for publication in the sept 18 issue 
of the journal physical review letters he said in a telephone 
interview 
researchers did not formally announce their findings because they 
felt it was too early to tell how the new process will do at higher 
temperatures and with other variables 
he said scientists can achieve fusion now in a hydrogen bomb but 
he added with a chuckle its not very controlled 
in the brookhaven experiments the fuel consisted of tiny 
clusters of molecules of heavy water whose hydrogen had been 
replaced by a heavier isotope deuterium which is commonly found in 
sea water 
the clusters he said were electrically charged and speeded up 
before being fired at a solid target of atoms the clusters heated 
and compressed at impact setting off the burst of nuclear energy 
this is really stellar research heating up a large number of 
atoms to the temperatures that exist in stars beuhler said

he was reported monday to be in worsening condition after 
gallbladder surgery last month

campaign in the west to encourage citizens to leave east germany

about 88 percent of vietnamese boat people 
languishing in this colonys fetid detention centers face forced 
repatriation the government said in figures released today 
over the past year just 424 vietnamese among the 3455 cases 
reviewed by the government won the right to stay in hong kong until 
they can be resettled elsewhere the figures said 
government officials said they expected further review would 
follow the pattern of the first year and that about 88 percent of 
the refugees would be denied the right to temporary stay in the 
colony 
at a news conference to disclose the findings francis blackwell 
chairman of the refuge status review board one of two agencies 
supervising the screening process said most of the vietnamese were 
economic migrants and not political refugees 
as such they should be returned home he said 
real refugees are hard to find blackwell said lies are 
legion for many migrants who pose as refugees and try to deceive not 
only the director of immigration but also the board 
britain and vietnam are currently negotiating on the forced 
return of the boat people to vietnam blackwell said it would take 
about two years for his board to finish screening all the boat 
people in hong kong to determine who was a refugee and who was 
simply an economic migrant 
although he did not name the united states blackwell criticized 
it for opposing forced repatriation calling it a pontius pilate 
that country he said washed its hands of the matter some 14 
years ago a reference to americas withdrawal from the vietnam 
war 
when asked whether he meant america blackwell replied who 
devastated vietnam 
hong kongs 55865 vietnamese boat people are divided up into two 
groups those who arrived before june 16 1988 and those who arrived 
after 
the 100000 who arrived before that date were automatically given 
refugee status and many were resettled in third countries 
currently about 13000 remain in hong kong awaiting resettlement 
they live in open camps and have the right to work 
the approximately 42000 who arrived later were placed in squalid 
detention centers which include converted ferries and several 
sparse islands in hong kongs harbor the colonys government 
require that they prove their refugee status before giving them the 
right to stay temporarily in hong kong 
over the past month there have been numerous fights at the 
camps including a bloody battle between vietnamese groups that left 
one man dead cholera has broken out among other vietnamese refugees 
living in primitive conditions on outlying islands 
under the screening process hong kong immigration department 
handles the first application appeals are sent to the refugee 
status review board 
blackwell said that most of those rejected in their first test 
are expected to appeal he said the board has heard 1719 appeals 
and overturned 136 decisions of the immigration department to send 
the boat people back

voters in new yorks tightest mayoral race in 12 
years decided today whether to nominate ed koch for an unprecedented 
fourth term or send david dinkins on his way to becoming the citys 
first black chief executive 
lastminute polls showed the race for the democratic nomination a 
dead heat in the republican primary former us attorney rudolph 
giuliani was expected to beat ronald lauder heir to the estee 
lauder cosmetics fortune 
for the 64yearold koch the race represents a fight for his 
political life the brash garrulous mayor of 12 years started out 
far behind dinkins the manhattan borough president but moved up 
strongly in the polls 
on monday koch pleaded with a crowd of about 500 at a rally 
reminding them im no 2 
mayday is a signal of distress for those who are nautically 
minded he said im saying to everybody who understands that 
expression i need you come out tomorrow vote for me mayday 
mayday 
dinkins had 48 percent and koch 47 percent in a poll of 
democratic voters taken sunday and monday for wabctv and the daily 
news far back were former city transit chief richard ravitch and 
controller harrison j goldin 
polls have shown giuliani with twothirds of the vote over 
lauder who has spent an estimated 12 million most of it his own 
on the race against the prosecutor who put mafia bosses wall street 
cheats and corrupt politicians behind bars 
kochs critics have portrayed him as having lost interest in the 
job and have accused of him being racially insensitive for such 
things as saying last year that jews would be crazy to vote for 
jesse jackson 
the softspoken dinkins has sought to portray himself as a 
conciliator who could heal divisions in the city 
drugs crime and homelessness were among other major issues 
the slaying of a black teenager by a gang of whites in brooklyn 
aug 23 brought the largely unspoken issue of race to the surface 
especially after koch criticized blacks for holding protest marches 
in the neighborhood 
both men pinned their hopes on turnout dinkins from union 
workers and blacks koch from jews and mainstream democrats 
koch hasnt faced a battle like this since 1977 when he first 
won the office in a close fight against mario cuomo now the 
governor koch handily won his primaries in 1981 and 1985 
on monday koch and dinkins shook hands and agreed to hold a 
unity rally wednesday no matter who wins to kick off the fall 
campaign against the gop 
we gotta get started on giuliani koch said this guys got 
clay knees and the reporters are only up to his ankles 
on the last full day of campaigning monday comedian jackie mason 
campaigned with giuliani in senior citizen centers mason said 
lauder should be locked up or 30 years without toilet paper for 
his attacks on giuliani 
lauder for his part said his polls showed its going to be a 
major upset he toured a shopping district in brooklyn where one 
woman told him i like your mother i use her makeup all the 
time

china executed two men accused of corruption and 
released four who turned themselves in and admitted their guilt 
news reports said today 
two other men who refused to admit their guilt were given life 
sentences in a group trial in a city gymnasium that was aired on 
national television and reported in detail in the beijing daily 
more than 2400 people including beijings communist party chief 
and politburo member li ximing attended the sentencing 
last week in a similar trial seven people who allegedly stole 
weapons from troops during the june 34 military attack on 
prodemocracy demonstrators were given jail terms of up to 13 years 
another seven who turned themselves in were let go 
the government has promised leniency to all student activists 
wanted by police for their activities during the prodemocracy 
movement it has issued a similar promise during its current 
campaign against corruption a major issue raised by students during 
the protest movement 
those who refuse to admit their crimes or give themselves up are 
being threatened with harsh punishment 
in the corruption cases wu keqiang vice director of a leather 
factory was accused of illegally trading in steel other metals and 
imitation leather in deals worth 92700 between 1981 and 1987 
he was also charged with bribing factory managers with television 
sets refrigerators tape recorders cameras electric fans 
watches washing machines motorcycles and bicycles worth 9000 to 
set up his black market transactions 
he was sentenced to death and executed immediately after the 
meeting the report said 
also sentenced to die was shen xiaoping 31 a purchasing agent 
for an electronics company who was charged with stealing 105000 
by using fake receipts the report did not say if the sentence was 
carried out 
wang huaiyin manager of a construction materials plant should 
have been sentenced to death for embezzlement and accepting bribes 
the beijing daily said but because he gave himself up to police 
last february he was allowed to go free 
the court also set free three others said to have voluntarily 
confessed their crimes 
in a separate report the beijing daily said citizens have turned 
in six submachine guns three pistols and 644 bullets in the past 10 
days that followed a call by security forces for citizens to give 
up weapons seized during the june military drive to recapture 
tiananmen square from prodemocracy demonstrators 
in another development the chinese government is erecting its 
own statue on approximately the same spot on tiananmen square where 
student demonstrators raised the goddess of democracy that was 
to become a symbol of their movement 
the 26foothigh statue of a worker peasant soldier and 
intellectual will be completed before oct 1 national day 
celebrations the official xinhua news agency said 
the report said the statue will be located about 105 feet south 
of the national flag pole at the northern end of the square 
the 33foot high goddess of democracy fashioned from white 
plastic foam by eight beijing art schools was unveiled on about the 
same spot on may 30 it was destroyed when military tanks invaded

reportedly forced to become porters for the military 
those who stumbled and fell and were unable to march were 
brutally beaten to death said a report received in bangkok from 
the kachin independence organization one of several ethnic rebel 
groups fighting the central government 
on friday a spokesman for burmas military government col aung 
thein denied the report since then three other independent 
sources have provided confirmation with varying degrees of detail 
we understand that political prisoners were conscripted to 
serve as porters in the north one western diplomatic source 
contacted in rangoon said there they were given virtually nothing 
to eat made to walk barefoot abused and taunted 
the kachins said the prisoners were bound together by ropes in a 
chain handtohand foottofoot and forced to each haul heavy 
loads of rice over rough jungle terrain from mongmawomongyin to 
namtu a distance of about 25 miles 
they were stripped beaten and taunted by the army escorts who 
shouted this is what democracy is all about the kachins said 
the sources said up to 500 prisoners were involved in the marches 
a junta of military officers on sept 18 declared a coup and 
brutally ended months of prodemocracy demonstrations in the 
southeast asian nation new arrests began in late july following 
smallscale protests and the arrest of several leading opposition 
figures 
the us state department last week charged that thousands had 
been arrested during the past seven weeks and some tortured while 
under detention 
the united states government condemns these acts of 
oppression spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the kachin report quoted one porter who escaped military control 
on aug 12 as saying he saw 14 students who had died after being 
beaten the porter said at least three to four students died daily 
and he quoted guards as saying the prisoners were deliberately being 
marched to death in the namtu area 
villagers living along the namdumongmawomongyin road told the 
kachins they were forced by the military to bury the dead the 
condition of the surviving prisoners was not known the sources said 
one source who asked not to be identified said he saw the group 
rounded up in a football stadium in namtu before the marches began 
he estimated that two thirds were people in their 20s while the rest 
were between 30 and 40 years of age about 20 women were reportedly 
among the prisoners 
there have been numerous previous reports of forced conscriptions 
of civilians and brutal treatment of porters by the burmese 
military some porters who escaped have been interviewed by 
journalists along the thaiburmese border 
last year the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international published two reports it said showed a consistent 
pattern of gross violations of human rights by the burmese 
military 
kachin as well as palaung and shan rebel groups operate in the 
namtu area the sources said that the rice carried by the prisoners 
had been confiscated from villagers by troops of the burmese armys 
99th light infantry division who claimed it had been stored by the 
locals for the kachin insurgents

labor party leader shimon peres said today he 
supports most of the provisions in an egyptian peace plan and is 
willing to push for a cabinet vote if the proposal is accepted by 
the palestinians 
the statement was likely to stir unease in israels joint 
government led by prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing 
likud bloc 
shamir said monday that his own peace initiative which he 
unveiled in april and was approved by the government must be 
implemented without any additions or eliminations 
nothing is obliging apart from the peace initiative that has 
been approved by the government and the parliament shamir said 
those who say other things are harming the decisions 
the israeli plan calls for elections in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip to choose palestinians for talks on an interim 
autonomy period with the final status of the occupied territories 
to be determined later 
the 10point plan proposed by egyptian president hosni mubarak 
includes israeli acceptance of the usbacked concept of trading 
land for peace it also calls for allowing the 140000 arabs in 
annexed east jerusalem to vote 
those points are acceptable to labor but not to likud the 
israeli proposal worked out by the two parties deliberately leaves 
these issues open 
the israeli daily davar said today that shamir was willing to 
show flexibility on the question of letting east jerusalem arabs 
vote and on the possible participation of two palestinian deportees 
in peace talks in exchange for a summit with mubarak 
shamirs aide yossi ahimeir denied the report and told davar it 
was an attempt to ignite fire within likud by showing that shamir 
is considering some concessions davar is affiliated with the 
labor party 
peres who serves as finance minister in the government said on 
israel army radio he would be willing to talk to a palestinian 
delegation with positions that would more or less conform with the 
10 points 
i dont think i have to accept all the 10 points or their 
style peres said i accept most of them and most of them are 
also accepted by the labors central committee or the partys 
governing body 
peres confirmed that abba eban a former foreign minister and a 
senior labor politician is likely to convey his views to egyptian 
leaders during his current visit to cairo 
ebans visit coincides with one by plo leader yasser arafat and 
egyptian newspaper alakhbar said arafat has told mubarak he 
supports the egyptian initiative however arafat left cairo monday 
night without making any statement 
two leading israeli dailies called on the government to adopt the 
egyptian proposal which the haaretz newspaper termed a positive 
document 
the masscirculation yediot ahronot newspaper accused shamir of 
undermining his own initiative by not showing a minimum of 
tactical flexibility

a ruffled pink dress concealed the tubes that 
have sustained her since birth but nothing could hide the 
excitement of a toddler planning to leave a hospital where she has 
lived all her life 
ogechi anyanwu waved and smiled and called frequently for her 
pacifier at a news conference to announce she will leave the johns 
hopkins childrens center wednesday for a hospital in missouri 
where her parents who are from nigeria plan to live 
her progress has been excellent and her prognosis for leading a 
normal life is terrific said dr david dudgeon ogechis 
pediatric surgeon 
ogechi weighed barely more than 2 pounds when she was born 
prematurely at hopkins in october 1986 within 10 days she 
developed an intestinal disease called neonatal necrotizing 
enterocolitis which kills bowel tissue 
the disease which strikes about one premature baby in 100 
spread quickly in ogechi doctors had to remove 80 percent of her 
small intestine and 50 percent of her colon 
without a normal intestine ogechi is unable to eat solid food 
even when she rides her tricycle a machine holding three bags that 
supply her with nutrients must trail behind her 
two pumps provide a mixture of fats proteins and sugars which 
she receives intravenously another provides 80 percent of her 
calories which she receives in a tube to her stomach 
to give her something to taste doctors have occasionally treated 
her to tiny sponges flavored with lemon extract 
its a far cry from ice cream but its something dudgeon 
said 
ogechis condition is exacerbated by diarrhea and frequent 
infections she must take antibiotics regularly and has returned to 
surgery more than a dozen times for repairs to her intestinal tract 
and insertion of intravenous lines for feeding 
despite her lifelong hospitalization doctors say ogechi is 
developmentally normal she weighs a robust 35 pounds and has an 
advanced vocabulary 
how many 3yearolds do you know who know how to say 
stethoscope asked dudgeon 
she is full of joy love very rambunctious and very giving 
she is truly a people person said maura mahon a nurse who cared 
for ogechi her first year 
nurse mary kay alford who has cared for ogechi the past year 
said aside from the fact that normal 3yearolds dont get their 
temperatures taken every four hours around the clock we try to give 
her as normal a life as possible 
alford will escort the child to university hospital in columbia 
mo where ogechis parents longinus and edith live her father 
teaches computer science at columbia college 
ogechis doctors anticipate the toddler will be released from the 
missouri hospital within several months 
dudgeon said ogechis intestines have recently doubled in length 
and grown in diameter which will soon allow her to eat food 
normally 
i expect that within a matter of months she will be eating 
solid food although she might have to stay away from real spicy 
pizza dudgeon said

voters went to the polls in a primary today with 
mayor coleman young a sure bet to advance to novembers runoff for 
an unprecedented fifth term 
the real question was who would finish second 13term us rep 
john conyers or accountant tom barrow 
the top two votegetters in the 13way nonpartisan primary will 
meet in the runoff and political analyst and racing handicapper 
bill ballenger judged young a 45 favorite better than even to 
finish first or second 
youngs challengers have charged that the 71yearold mayor has 
been in office too long and they ran what were dubbed abc 
campaigns for anyone but coleman the dean of americas black 
mayors branded his challengers uncle toms 
slightly more than 30 percent of the citys registered voters 
were expected to go to the polls deputy city clerk jeff blaine 
said turnout for the last mayoral primary in 1985 was 23 percent 
he said 
ballenger who publishes a newsletter on michigan politics and is 
the race handicapper for the detroit free press said conyers was a 
slight favorite over barrow while city council president erma 
henderson had a slight chance of finishing in the top two 
barrow who like young conyers and henderson is black is 
thought to have a strong chance of finishing no 2 because of his 
appeal among whites who make up about 25 percent of detroits 
507000 registered voters barrow got more than 55 percent of the 
white vote in the 1985 primary but lost to young 6139 percent in 
the general election 
conyers and barrow have accused the mayor of neglecting 
neighborhoods at the expense of downtown development and not doing 
enough about drug use among police 
conyers a late entry in the race picked up the endorsement of 
the rev jesse jackson who exhorted a crowd monday to keep hope 
alive by voting for conyers barrow who led last years 
opposition to youngs third effort to bring casino gambling to 
detroit has been endorsed by a few unions and church leaders most 
have committed to young 
one matter that put young into the headlines a few months ago 
the disclosure that he fathered a child by a former city 
administrator hasnt been much of an issue

lawyers for the man convicted of killing 
prime minister olof palme asked an appellate court today to overturn 
the ruling for lack of evidence 
he totally lacked a motive to murder palme defense attorney 
arne liljeros said of christer pettersson who was convicted in july 
of the 1986 shooting and was sentenced to life in prison 
liljeros said pettersson sympathized with palmes politics and 
admired the social democratic leader liljeros also said there was 
no forensic evidence pointing to pettersson as the killer 
palme and his wife lisbeth were walking home from a late movie 
on feb 28 1986 when an assailant shot palme and wounded his wife 
pettersson 42 had been convicted in a split decision by the 
lower district court jury with six lay jurors voting to convict and 
the panels two professional judges voting to acquit 
the conviction came even though no motive was established no 
murder weapon was found and no one saw pettersson shoot palme 
the svea court of appeals which will hear many of the 43 
witnesses who testified in the lower court consists of four 
professional judges and three lay jurors two new witnesses were 
also scheduled to testify 
the prosecution today asked the court to change petterssons 
conviction of endangerment in the shooting of mrs palme to one of 
attempted murder asking for stiffer sentences during appeals is the 
prosecutions prerogative under the swedish system 
the lay jurors in the lower court based their judgment heavily on 
the testimony of mrs palme who said she saw pettersson standing 
nearby just after her husband was shot she did not testify to 
seeing him with a gun however 
liljeros complained he had not been allowed in the room when mrs 
palme picked out pettersson in a police lineup after petterssons 
arrest in december 
i havent heard any statements seen any reactions or been able 
to pose any questions about the first identification by mrs 
palme liljeros said 
arguments in the appeal were scheduled to end oct 5 
if the lower courts decision is overturned pettersson must be 
released immediately

unusually large squadrons of hostile yellow 
jacket wasps joined by an aggressive new species are sending 
people to hospitals along the west coast 
those suckers are eating us alive said ruth budesa of the 
northern california town of sonora 
at least one horse died after disturbing a nest of the 
meateating yellow jacket also known as the meat bee 
one sting is enough to kill a hypersensitive human said 
george poinar an entomologist at the university of california 
berkeley fifty to 75 stings are enough to kill a normal human 
last weekend more than 20 sting victims sought aid at the 
yosemite national park clinic including a woman who went into 
shock rangers say more than 100 people have been treated for wasp 
stings in the past three weeks 
this in my 10 years of experience is the worst ive ever seen 
for meat bees sad ed heneveld who works in the tahoe forest 
hospital emergency room in truckee ive treated five people 
myself who have been stung inside the mouth 
entomologists say last winters mild weather allowed more wasps 
to survive in addition a new and aggressive strain of wasps from 
northern europe has settled on the west coast the entomologists 
said 
the germanica species builds nests to house 5000 to 6000 
workers the native california species builds nests for only 150 to 
300 workers 
in addition to california heavy activity has been reported in 
oregon and as far north as british columbia said roger akre a 
university of washington entomologist 
the beaches are just humming with them right now said glenn 
bissell of the el dorado county health department bissell said 
traps he set out in the lake tahoe area are catching more than 50 
wasps a week the worst in a decade

despite her governing labor partys worst 
electoral showing since 1930 prime minister gro harlem brundtland 
seems likely to remain in office 
when the dust settled from mondays turbulent national vote the 
balance of power seemed to have changed little because the 
conservative opposition also lost ground 
voters had switched allegiances as never before 
a radical rightwing party went into the election with two 
parliament seats and came out with 22 a farleft party doubled its 
strength 
this election clearly shows that the new generation is sick and 
tired of the old parties said trygve bull a retired educator and 
former leftist politician 
as in the 1985 election mrs brundtland and her allies were left 
just shy of a majority but it was unclear if the opposition parties 
could overcome their disunity to unseat her 
according to official results with all but the absentee ballots 
counted labor won 63 seats in an expanded 165seat parliament or 
storting and 17 seats went to its allied socialist left party the 
threeparty nonsocialist alliance conservatives christian 
democrats and center party received 62 seats 
shunned as a partner by all other parties the rightist party of 
progress swept up 22 seats in a stunning performance that indicated 
widespread disenchantment with the social welfare policies of the 
last 40 years 
a lone independent won a seat on a local list after he broke with 
labor 
labor was hurt by record unemployment of 5 percent and discontent 
among this countrys 42 million people with a growing shortage of 
hospital facilities daycare centers and care for the aged about 
824 percent of registered voters turned out 
official results showed labor with 896717 votes or 343 percent 
of the ballots down 65 percent from the 398 percent it polled 
four years ago the conservatives had 580425 votes and 222 percent 
of the vote 
the progress party won 340461 votes for 13 percent of the total 
nearly triple its percentage from the last election and the 
socialist lefts 261814 votes represented 10 percent or nearly 
double its past percentage 
in a postelection television debate of party leaders mrs 
brundtland watched silently while her opponents traded 
recriminations you are the ones creating chaos one accused the 
rest 
despite the setback mrs brundtland said she had no intention to 
quit and doubted that any centerright alliance could last for 
long a nonsocialist coalition could break up at any time she 
said 
her refusal to step down meant the opposition would have to 
defeat her in a noconfidence motion when parliament convenes on 
oct 2 
opposition leader jan p syse of the conservative party which 
also suffered heavy losses admitted that it was not the best 
result for forming an alternative government 
the opposition parties were split over tax issues welfare 
programs agricultural subsidies relations with the european 
community and immigration policies 
carl i hagen the progress partys bluntspeaking leader said 
he was prepared to help topple the labor government in a 
noconfidence vote and to negotiate a majority government but he 
accused the other nonsocialists of locking him out 
you say no to even entering the room to discuss the question 
with us he said in the television debate blaming them for the 
chaos in the rightist camp 
the next government will have to be a minority government 
said center party leader johan j jakobsen the 12 percent who 
voted for the progress party cant dictate policies that the other 
88 percent of voters will have to live with

the skeletal remains of thousands of american 
indians will be buried in their native soil under an agreement 
announced today by the smithsonian institution members of congress 
and indian leaders 
today a process has started that will allow the ancestors of 
native americans to at last find their final resting place said 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs its a day that will be celebrated by 
indian leaders throughout indian country 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo an american indian who was 
instrumental in achieving the compromise said the provisions would 
be included in a bill before the house that will establish a 
national museum of the american indian in washington 
under this agreement the smithsonian is going to inventory the 
human remains and funerary objects which are those objects that are 
placed in gravesites with indian people when they are buried 
campbell said at a news conference 
those remains that can be identifed either specifically or by 
the name of tribe the smithsonian will notify the individuals in 
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them 
the agreement represents a change of thinking by the 
administration of the smithsonian which previously had said the 
bones were necessary for scientific study said institution 
secretary robert mcc adams 
i should make clear theres a deep sense of loss on the part of 
many scientists at the smithsonian he said 
but adams said he was persuaded by years of listening to 
anguished indians and reading about the atrocities committed against 
indians during this countrys western expansion 
that becomes a weight that one ultimately cannot carry he 
said 
suzan harjo head of the national congress of american indians 
said the smithsonian was setting a precedent bound to influence 
museums all over the country which have the remains of an estimated 
600000 indians 
there is no doubt about it the smithsonian is king of the 
hill when it comes to setting policy she said 
the smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately 
18000 indians eskimos and aleuts most of which were unearthed 
during archaeological excavations construction or erosion about 
4000 remains came from the army medical museum and were transferred 
to the smithsonian at the turn of the century many of those were 
the result of graverobbing 
indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several 
years on religious grounds but adams had said the smithsonian would 
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or 
traced to living descendants in the last 18 months only the 
remains of 18 blackfeet were returned according to adams 
inouye and campbell are sponsoring bills to establish a national 
museum of the american indian in washington the museum would be 
created when the collection of the museum of the american indian in 
new york city is transferred to the smithsonian the shift cant 
take place without legislation providing funds and giving the 
smithsonian authority to build 
the smithsonian said last week it would keep a museum at the 
current site in upper manhattan in addition to building a washington 
museum the new york museums collection is the worlds largest 
collection of indian artifacts

mazowiecki looking exhausted but composed asked for a recess 
he was examined by doctors who found no serious problems said 
dr zofia kuratowska a senator and solidarity activist 
the prime minister nominated 23 people to cabinetlevel posts 11 
as ministers solidarity will have 12 votes on the council of 
ministers because mazowiecki is also a member 
the candidate for the foreign ministry is considered an 
independent 
mazowiecki was elected prime minister aug 24 after communist 
prime minister gen czeslaw kiszczak resigned when he was unable to 
form a government 
the communists have four cabinet posts and the peasant party and 
the democratic party which switched their long alliance with the 
communist party to form a coalition with solidarity last month 
received four and three posts respectively 
once in place the solidarity government must cope with a 39 
billion foreign debt and a work force demoralized by long lines for 
scarce poor quality goods

the bush administration will hold admissions of 
refugees to the united states to 125000 in the next fiscal year an 
increase of slightly less than 8 percent from this year the 
chairman of a house panel said today 
the administration which doubled the allotment for people from 
the soviet union this year to 50000 has decided the country cannot 
handle more and will leave the figure the same for the year 
beginning oct 1 said rep bruce morrison dconn who heads the 
house subcommittee on immigration 
but morrison speaking at the start of subcommittee hearings 
about the administrations proposed plan said the governments 
proposal only provides funding for 84000 refugees 
where do we get the money for the rest he asked a panel of 
private witnesses government officials will testify wednesday 
morrison also expressed concern about the backlog of an estimated 
20000 soviet emigres in rome and vienna awaiting us decisions on 
their eligibility to enter this country he said the administration 
had wasted money through this processing method and changes would 
have to be considered 
the administration would like to shut down the vienna and rome 
facilities and handle all applications at the us embassy in moscow 
by increasing the current staff of several processors to more than 
two dozen 
morrison said congress will also debate pending legislation that 
would determine the criteria for granting refugee status to soviet 
and other emigres 
under a revision of regulations ordered last year each person 
applying must prove individual eligibility for refugee status which 
means government aid in resettlement and admission outside the 
normal immigration rules previously jews from the soviet union 
were automatically considered refugees 
the new decision has made the backlog grow 
the hebrew immigrant aid society which helps resettle soviet 
jews told morrisons subcommittee that 46 percent of the applicants 
in moscow had been rejected for refugee status 
karl zukerman executive vice president of the organization 
predicted that at least 72000 jews will apply to enter the united 
states next fiscal year 
overall this years refugee quota arrived at by the 
administration each year in consultation with the house and senate 
judiciary committees is 116000 people up from 94000 at the start 
of the 1988 fiscal year last oct 1 
the 125000 figure for next year would include 4000 whose 
resettlement would be paid for by private organizations 
rep lamar smith rtexas said the number of people facing 
persecution around the world grows every day at the same time as 
us budget resources are shrinking he urged other countries to 
help the united states share the burden

alexander haig today denied as totally 
untrue a published report saying he would reveal in a future book 
that he was the deep throat source for many newspaper stories 
about watergate 
my efforts then and now have been to preserve the presidency 
not to tear it down said haig who was richard nixons chief of 
staff in his last 16 months in office 
the story regarding my being deep throat is totally untrue 
haig said 
the new york daily news quoting unnamed sources said haig would 
disclose that he was deep throat in his memoirs to be published 
in 1992 by warner books 
washington post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein who 
wrote many of the stories that led to exposure of the watergate 
scandal that brought about nixons resignation have conistently 
refused to identify deep throat who they said was a major 
inside source 
the washington post won the pulitzer prize for distinguished 
public service for its watergate coverage 
haig came to the white house with the nixon administration in 
1969 serving as military assistant to the president and to national 
security adviser henry kissinger until 1973 he left briefly to be 
vice chief of staff of the army and returned to succeed white house 
chief of staff hr haldeman who had resigned in the watergate 
affair he served as secretary of state early in the reagan

about 2400 teachers began returning to work today in sacramento 
calif after reaching a tentative contract agreement in the

illinois and michigan 
the settlements left some 5300 teachers on strike affecting 
more than 93000 students in eight states 
details on the agreement that ended the twoweek sacramento

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced 
today a ninemonth extension of the current sugar import quota year 
and an increase of about 860000 tons in the amount of foreign sugar 
that can be imported 
import quotas are used to protect domestic producers from cheaper 
foreign sugar being dumped on the us market 
the original 1989 quota year began jan 1 and was to have ended 
dec 31 the extension lets the quota year run through sept 30 
1990 
this change puts quota shipments for the new 21month quota 
period at a somewhat higher level on a 12month equivalent basis 
than the previously announced quota of 1125255 metric tons 
yeutter said in a statement 
now with the extension the new 198990 quota will be 1986950 
tons an average of 94617 tons per month or a 12month equivalent 
of about 1135400 tons an increase of about 1 percent from the 
old quota 
yeutter said the change in the quota was an action 
independent of a ruling earlier this year by the general agreement 
on tariff and trade that the us sugar import quotas are in 
violation of international trading rules 
we are continuing to look at the options for bringing these 
quotas into conformity with the gatt but a decision on how to do 
this has not been made he said 
in the interim this modification of the import quota and the 
quota period is necessary to correct for a tightness in our sugar 
market particularly during the last quarter of this calendar 
year yeutter said 
shipping patterns are being adjusted to assure that 135000 tons 
of the increase provided by the stretched quota period are allowed 
to enter the united states during the octoberdecember quarter he 
said 
we will continue to monitor on a daytoday basis whether 
additional modifications in the quota are necessary yeutter said 
new countrybycountry quota allocations were announced today by 
us trade representative carla hills 
the allocations include a reallocation of panamas initial quota 
of 30537 tons and leave 23403 tons of the new panama quota 
unallocated and not yet authorized for shipment to the united 
states the announcement said 
panamas remaining 23403 tons may subsequently be allocated to 
other countries as was done in 1988 and as has just been done for 
their initial quota allocation of 30537 metric tons it said 
other allocations for the period jan 1 1989 through sept 30 
1990 in metric tons of 2205 pounds each include

police and fbi officials said 
they would study videotapes today of a weekend riot at a paper mill 
to learn who incited the mob violence against nonunion construction 
workers 
if we have 200 trials so be it city attorney joseph boyle 
told the city council on monday 
koochiching county attorney dave johnson who charged six people 
monday with a variety of counts said he would file charges today 
against 18 others arrested in the violence saturday at the boise 
cascade corp mill 
in addition four union mill workers were suspended while company 
officials determine if they participated said boise spokesman bob 
anderson a former mayor of the town of 6500 on the canada border 
during the weekend melee rioters set fire to vacant trailers 
overturned cars and threw rocks law enforcement officers used tear 
gas to break up the crowd and arrested 31 people five people were 
injured and damage was estimated at 13 million 
the melee involved mostly union construction workers angered by 
the use of nonunion labor on the mills 535 million expansion 
project 
police planned to join fbi agents and sheriffs officials in 
studying videotapes police made saturday to determine who instigated 
the violence 
earlier police watching the tape identified five or six people 
who will be arrested and charged johnson said a meeting between 
company and union officials also was planned for this afternoon to 
review the tapes anderson said 
there could be a penalty up to and including discharge 
anderson said if there is nothing found the employees will be 
paid as if they worked all their hours 
if they start going after the mill employees theyll have a 
real mess on their hands said bruce ness a 20year mill employee 
who was one of the four suspended also suspended was nesss father 
we were just standing on the street watching bruce ness 
said i guess boise cascade is trying to say we dont have any of 
our own civil rights 
union leaders condemned saturdays riot but said violence could 
break out again 
an fbi agent arrived in international falls because some rioters 
crossed state lines to get to the boise plant johnson said two of 
the six people charged monday were from michigan the others from 
minnesota 
the charges against the six included riot damage to property 
arson trespassing and assault johnson said they appeared before a

a lawyer fed up with unsolicited sales calls has 
won a court order barring the nations biggest brokerage and its 
12000 stockbrokers from calling him at work 
its been something that has bothered a lot of people but they 
dont have the sense they can do something about it said alan j 
schlesinger 
merrill lynch said it will appeal the order which was issued 
june 2 in superior court and was reported today in the boston globe 
william fitzpatrick general counsel for the securities industry 
association said it sounds like hes using an atom bomb to deal 
with a gnat 
being a fellow lawyer i guess he doesnt have enough brains to 
hang up fitzpatrick said 
schlesinger said he took action after getting a couple of 
unsolicited calls from stockbrokers every month for years in 1984 
and 185 he wrote to merrill lynch the most persistent firm 
asking that it order its brokers to stop calling 
the last straw came in 1988 when schlesinger returned a call from 
an woman in new york and found she was a merrill lynch broker with 
an investment proposal at that point i said i am going to get 
their attention he said 
fred yager a merrill lynch vice president said he believes the 
company will win on appeal 
we have 12000 brokers working for us alone he said its 
virtually impossible to prevent another call from getting through to 
him accidentally 
merrill lynch said that after schlesinger won the court order it 
asked its bostonarea brokers to stop calling him two week later a 
merrill lynch broker who said he was unaware of the court order 
called schlesinger with a sales pitch 
schlesinger filed for contempt charges and was awarded 300 in 
court costs

colombias cali cocaine cartel is more 
efficient than its more wellknown medellin counterpart and as a 
result it may be shipping more drugs to the united states 
according to a senate report today 
the report by the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations minority staff says us law enforcement agencies 
agree the cali cartel although smaller in number runs a much 
more businesslike less highprofile operation than the medellin 
cartel 
medellin appears to be more loosely organized informal and 
spontaneous in its operational style than cali the report says 
in fact some law enforcement officials believe cali actually 
ships more cocaine to the united states than medellin 
mary vincent who presented the report said there are estimates 
that the medellin cartel has as many as 100000 members and the 
cali cartel from 2500 to 6000 members 
bruce m carnes a top aide to national drug control policy 
director william bennett told the subcommittee that the enemy is 
the organizations that produce cocaine and other dangerous drugs 
transport it to our shores distribute it to retailers and users 
throughout america and launder the profits and return them to the 
organizations coffers 
the objective of the war on drugs he said is to put these 
organizations out of business dismantle them 
under questioning by subcommittee chairman sam nunn dga 
carnes acknowedged that the two primary measures of drug abuse in 
the united states the household survey by the national institute on 
drug abuse and a high school survey are not comprehensive 
the household survey does not measure use by students in dorms or 
people in institutions and the survey of high school seniors does 
not take into account those young people who have dropped out of 
school 
so basically what youre saying is after 20 years of fighting 
the socalled war against drugs thats been declared by at least 
four to five presidents of both political partieswe still not 
only dont have adequate tools and we arent using the tools in the 
right direction and the ones we are using to measure our success or 
failure are not even developed yet is that too strong nunn asked 
this glass is half full in my view and i think were better 
than we used to be carnes said 
the subcommittee report says fabio castillo a colombian 
journalist who fled his native country due to threats from drug 
traffickers and who was to testify before the subcommittee today 
believes that cali is indeed the more significant of the two 
cartels 
a rivalry between the medellin and cali organizations does not 
yet appear to have either threatened the existence or significantly 
affected the operations of these two cartels says the report 
which was obtained monday by the associated press 
sen william v roth jr rdel the panels ranking minority 
member said the report and hearings this week are the first major 
public effort to expose in detail these organizations their 
membership and their methods of operation 
we cant win the war on drugs if we dont know the enemy 
roth said in a statement 
administration drug experts say 80 percent of the cocaine in the 
united states is processed in and shipped from colombia although 60 
percent of the coca leaf is grown in peru 30 percent in bolivia and 
only 10 percent in colombia 
while the report confirms the belief that the medellin and cali 
cartels dominate the cocaine trade in the western hemisphere it 
notes secondary trafficking groups along colombias north coast 
rent a variety of their smuggling services to the top two and 
conduct their own trafficking operations 
larger drug trafficking organizations are run like corporations 
with each stage of the cocaine processing and distribution handled 
by a separate department the report says 
we found definite indications that a trafficker of the stature 
of medellin cartel leader jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha for 
example will have his own coca paste suppliers his own 
laboratories his own stash sites and his own warehouses in the 
united states the report says 
the report resulting from a yearlong investigation does not 
attempt to determine how the organizations may have been changed or 
disrupted by the crackdown imposed by colombian president virgilio 
barco

antinuclear activists today protested the 
launch next month of a nuclearpowered space probe but 
administration officials say president bush will not block the 
flight 
the president is expected by next week to authorize the use of a 
48pound nuclear generator to provide electrical power for the 
galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch to jupiter from the shuttle 
atlantis on oct 12 
the nuclear powerplant is similar to the one the voyager 2 
spacecraft used so successfully on its 12year journey to neptune 
and beyond and on 21 other space devices but protesters worry 
about a release of radioactivity should the atlantis have an 
accident similar to the one that destroyed challenger 
a recent safety analysis by the national aeronautics and space 
administration concluded the probability of an accident resulting 
in a release of plutonium ranges from 1in2500 to 1in2 million 
and any release from these low probability events would be very 
small 
about a half dozen signcarrying protesters stood outside nasas 
national headquarters today passing out a flyer that said keep 
project galileos plutonium on the ground 
one sign said if galileo explodes kiss florida goodbye and 
another said one pound of plutonium could kill every person on 
earth the demonstrators represented the maryland safe energy 
coalition which is headquartered in columbia md 
this weekend a group called the florida coalition for peace and 
justice says it will begin a 200mile peace walk from cape 
canaveral to kings bay ga to protest both the galileo probe and 
the trident missile program 
a spokesman said the walk will be completed oct 8 and the 
protesters will return in time for the atlantis launch 
we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the 
launch pad to halt the october launch said bruce gagnon of 
orlando leader of the florida group which has staged past 
demonstrations against trident launches 
kings bay is where the trident is flight tested 
a lawyer for the christic institute larry sinkin said the group 
will file suit in federal court later this month to stop the 
atlantis launch citing among its reasons the very poor record 
nasa has of estimating risks and the reliability of the shuttle 
itself 
the presidents science advisers are studying risk assessments of 
the launch and a separate safety evaluation thomas p rona deputy 
director of the white house office of science and technology policy 
said monday 
an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
asked if the galileo launch will be approved replied certainly 
rona declined to say what the recommendation to bush will be but 
said every possible design precaution has been taken my 
personal opinion is that the shuttle is far more reliable now than 
before 
elizabeth prestridge spokeswoman for the national space council 
which is chaired by vice president dan quayle said the staff 
considers the galileo probe safe and a congressional source said 
there is no doubt the president will allow the launch 
the review process which makes white house approval mandatory 
before nuclear isotopes can be launched into space has been in 
effect since 1977 
the nuclear devices are called rtgs for radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators they have never caused a spacecraft 
failure although three of the 22 have been involved in space 
mission accidents with no release of plutonium 
galileo will be the first spacecraft to orbit jupiter and it will 
insert a probe into the atmosphere to investigate thick cloud layers 
covering the huge planet the trip is a complicated one in which the 
spacecraft will twice return near earth for gravity boosts to gain 
necessary velocity to reach jupiter in 1995

four israeli employees of the us embassy have 
been arrested on charges they were involved in a scheme to produce 
counterfeit us visas the embassy announced tuesday 
the four were arrested by israeli police monday for alleged 
participation in a conspiracy involving the purchase of us 
nonimmigrant visas an embassy statement said it said no american 
employees of the embassy were believed involved 
nonimmigrant visas are issued to tourists visitors on exchange 
programs and people with specialized shortterm jobs 
the maariv newspaper said in a report tuesday that police had 
uncovered a network of people producing bogus visas to the 
united states 
it said the investigation started several weeks ago and that 
police believed the false visas were being produced with stamps and 
documents stolen from the embassy 
there are apparently dozens involved in the affair some acting 
as middlemen between visa seekers and the counterfeiting ring 
maariv reported 
the paper said the people seeking the visas were israelis with 
criminal records or citizens who lacked the necessary documents to 
qualify for legal visas

president bush told the nations schoolchildren 
by television today that saying no to drugs wont make you a 
nerd 
in a midday speech from the white house library bush called 
drugs an equal opportunity destroyer 
they have no conscience he said they dont care where the 
money comes from they just murder people young and old good and 
bad innocent and guilty it doesnt matter for too many drugs 
mean death 
the presidents address was broadcast live by all four major 
television networks for viewing in schools and marked the latest 
round in bushs campaign to fight the flood of drugs in american 
society 
the speech came a week after bush unveiled a 79 billion 
national drug strategy that calls for more prisons more 
prosecutors tougher sentences and aid to latin american nations to 
help combat drug cartels 
many democrats have assailed the package as too modest and sen 
robert byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee said he was introducing legislation today to boost it to 
101 billion to pay for the increase byrd proposed cutsin many 
domestic and defense programs of 0575 percent 
presidents dont often get the chance to talk directly to 
students so today for each of you sitting in a classroom or 
assembly hall this message goes straight to you bush said in 
his 15minute speech 
most of you are doing the right thing he said but for 
those of you who let drugs make their decisions for them you can 
almost hear the doors slamming shut 
the president equated drugs with death and displaying the badge 
of a slain 22yearold rookie policeman said i keep this badge 
in a drawer in my desk to remind me of that 
the badge belonged to new york city police officer eddie byrne 
who was killed in 1988 while protecting a witness in a drug case it 
was presented to bush during a campaign appearance in new york last 
year by byrnes father 
bush displayed the badge several times during the presidential 
campaign 
in the early hours of a cold february morning sitting in a 
police cruiser eddie was blown away at pointblank range killed 
on the order of a drug kingpin cold and caculated the president 
said 
to me this badge is a constant reminder that eddie byrnes 
life was not given in vain the president said 
in a speech that aides said was particularly tailored to 
schoolchildren bush said ill let you in on a secret we all can 
succeed if you dont use drugs you can be anything you want to be 
so dont blow it 
saying no wont make you a nerd it wont make you a loser 
in fact it will make you more friends than drugs ever will real 
friends 
at another point in the speech the president held up a baseball 
and told his audience i used to play baseball knew id never 
make the big leagues but i made a lot of friends he stressed the 
importance of friends on and off the field 
bush wearing a blue suit and a red tie spoke in measured tones 
during the speech and looked directly into the camera 
bushs drug program which calls for spending 717 million more 
in the upcoming fiscal year than he had previously requested has 
run into stiff opposition from many congressional democrats some 
have claimed it doesnt go far enough and others have denounced his 
proposal to cut other domestic programs to help finance it 
in advance of todays speech presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater accused democrats of playing price tag politics with 
the drug war 
fitzwater said the white house expected millions of students to 
watch bushs address 
the president combined his warnings against drug use with a plea 
that drugfree students help troubled friends im asking you not 
to look the other way he said 
you know all of you in a classroom know whos got a problem 
today im not just asking you to get help im asking you to find 
someone who needs you and offer to help 
asserting that the day of the dealer is drawing to a close 
bush said some think there wont be room for them in jail well 
make room some think there arent enough prosecutors well 
hire them with the largest increase in federal prosecutors in 
history 
no matter who you are or how strong you are drugs take 
control of your life but without drugs youre in control you can 
determine your future and that means staying in school the 
president said 
and he added using illegal drugs is against the law and if 
you break the law you pay the price because the rules have 
changed 
earlier white house communications director david demarest said 
that in preparing the address there was a fair amount of 
consideration of who the message was directed to it is not heavily 
laden with particular policy information 
it is more of an effort to communicate to the kids why drugs or 
doing drugs is a mistake and why its important for kids to try and 
help other kids for them to intervene in someone elses life 
demarest added 
bush on monday sought to dispel new speculation raised by the 
weekend disclosure of a secret white house directive that he was 
prepared to send us combat forces to the three andean drugsupply 
nations of colombia bolivia and peru 
let me state clearly none of the andean nations have asked for 
us troops and there is no contemplation of the use of american 
armed forces in any combat role there the president said 
speaking at a ceremony honoring the treasury departments 200th 
anniversary bush said no us military forces would accompany host 
government forces on actual field operations 
our personnel will provide training equipment and operational 
support bush said and i will see that it works exactly that 
way

toads that grow to the size of dinner 
plates are invading brisbane australias thirdlargest city and 
local authorities are planning an elaborate program to get rid of 
them 
for toads in brisbane this summer is shaping up as a 
nightmarish scene from the texas chainsaw massacre the sydney 
morning herald said tuesday the day the eradication project was 
announced 
plans include ringing the citys suburbs with recordings of the 
rattling call the male toad uses to attract females when the 
unsuspecting females arrive trappers will shove them into plastic 
bags and freeze them said greg stegman a city councilman in charge 
of the eradication plan 
residents who find toads around their homes are being advised to 
sprinkle detergent on them because it does the job quickly 
stegman said 
he promised that the city of 1 million in the northeastern state 
of queensland will be toadfree within five years 
the queensland museum said the toads pose a major threat to 
australias fauna and wildlife biologists say the toads when 
cornered and frightened squirt a liquid that can asphyxiate a dog 
the size of a german shepherd 
the cane toads were first introduced to australia in 1935 when 
they were brought in from south america to end a beatle plague that 
was destroying crops 
since then they have marched across northern australia and are 
heading south the biggest weigh more than five pounds and children 
occasionally use them as footballs 
stegman said the current infestation began after the toads began 
to wake up after their winter hibernation 
theyre in plague proportions he said im not advocating 
that people stamp them to death or spear them with pitchforks but 
something has to be done 
anne nakano of brisbane complained that the space underneath her 
home which is built on stilts is crawling with toads we stamp 
on them when we open the front door in the morning to pick up the 
milk she said 
the city council decided against offering a bounty for every toad 
killed because knowing the australian entrepreneurial spirit 
theyll start breeding them stegman said 
the state of queensland is holding a contest to find the biggest 
toad to be entered in the guinness book of world records the 
leading candidate is mary lou who measures one foot across weighs 
six pounds and eats 11 mice a day in addition to eggs mixed with 
insects

firefighters today dumped truckloads of 
dirt on a heap of 15 million tires and knocked down a smoky fire so 
fierce that water just vaporized but the pile of rubber could 
smolder for weeks 
the blaze the second fire in four years at the usedtire dump 
now has townspeople asking where is ernie hunt 
hunt is the attentionloving guy who assembled the tires at the 
sevenacre dump before it was taken away by the state over the 1985 
blaze hunt began amassing the tires 15 years ago charging gas 
stations 50 cents a tire 
mr hunt remains at large said geoffrey huntington the 
assistant attorney general who has been dealing with the dump hunt 
is wanted on a perjury warrant accusing him of lying at hearings on 
the seizure of the site 
the stubborn fire broke out sunday sending flames 40 feet into 
the air and billowing acrid black smoke that could be seen 25 miles 
away 
about 250 firefighters from 45 communities in three states worked 
to contain the fire sixtyfive trucks and 10 loaders through the 
night hauled tons of dirt from a sand and gravel pit 
we switched from water because even at 2500 gallons a minute 
the water was vaporizing said david tordoff of the environmental 
protection agency said instead we will smother it 
about 50 residents were evacuated some began returning to their 
homes late monday 
william toland state fire marshal said the cause of the blaze 
appeared suspicious it was out of control right from the 
beginning he said the fire just absolutely raged 
six years ago hunt received a 22000 down payment from a london 
company that had planned to ship the tires to africa with the 
money hunt bought a luxury automobile but the tires were never 
moved in july the state contracted with a buffalo ny company 
to shred the tires for shipment to greece to fuel a cement plant 
the removal was to have begun shortly 
its not ernie so much said danville resident jackie mclean 
i used to say to him hey ernie what are you going to do with 
all those tires and hed say someday somebody will want them 
he was just following the american dream the towns knew what he was 
doing i blame the communities 
he was quite a character said tim dube past whose house 
hunt used to drive his car he liked the attention 
but said dube the state and the communities should have done 
something years ago 
tordoff said his agency earmarked up to 1 million from the 
superfund for the effort he said epa scientists were monitoring 
air soil and ground water for harmful chemicals from the fire the 
1984 blaze smoldered for several weeks 
tordoff estimated that 2 acres of tires 30 to 40 feet high were 
on fire 
amy juchatz a state toxicologist said the smoke could cause 
respiratory problems and other irritation and that lead and zinc 
fumes and other chemicals possibly cancercausing could be inhaled 
or could contaminate the soil

a rise in ocean levels caused by the melting of 
polar icecaps during a global warming trend could devastate 
lowlying countries and submerge some islands environmental experts 
said tuesday 
the worlds poorest countries are likely to be hit hardest the 
experts said as higher temperatures destroy traditional crops and 
spread tropical diseases 
specialists at a threeday conference on the worlds environment 
sponsored by the japanese government said lowlying countries like 
bangladesh could lose up to 20 percent of their land area as sea 
levels rise thousands of pacific islands could disappear as a 
result of melting polar icecaps they said 
scientists have predicted the earth will warm gradually over 
coming decades because of an increase of manmade gases in the 
atmosphere that prevent heat from escaping the phenomenon is known 
as the greenhouse effect 
dennis tirpak director of the us environmental protection 
agencys global climate change division said temperatures are 
likely to increase by 3 to 5 degrees and ocean levels could rise up 
to 6 feet if current emissions of the gases continue through the 
next century 
the gases primarily carbon dioxide methane and 
chlorofluorocarbons are created by the burning of fossil fuels and 
industrial and agricultural processes 
the limited financial resources of developing countries in asia 
and the greater dependency of many of these countries on natural 
resource production make them especially vulnerable to the impacts 
of global warming tirpak said 
in addition the environment in many developing countries may be 
particularly sensitive to climatic changes because of previous 
damage from rapid population growth and deforestation he said 
if current trends continue global warming will be more extreme 
than anything which has occurred during the period of written 
history said irving mintzer of the university of marylands 
center for global change 
the stresses which would result from such a rapid climate 
change threaten to undermine the stability of modern civilization 
he said 
tirpak said rising temperatures could endanger food production 
and economic growth in developing asian nations where agriculture 
contributes up to 80 percent of income and employment 
the sensitivity of rice asias staple food to high 
temperatures and widespread farming of marginal lands make the 
region particularly vulnerable to soaring temperatures he said 
rising temperatures also could worsen droughts in india and other 
nations and cover portions of indias western coast bangladesh 
egypt indonesia and the maldives with sea water officials said 
the homes and lives of millions of people living in the deltas 
of the ganges the nile the mekong the yangtze and the mississippi 
could be at risk mintzer said 
the 60 officials and specialists participating in the conference 
part of a new japanese environmental initiative are expected to 
release a set of recommendations wednesday to combat global warming 
and protect the environment

at least 10000 east germans jammed 
resettlement camps in west germany today and thousands more arrived 
in hungary waiting to follow the newly opened path to the west 
residents of this border town filled a convention hall with 
banners and balloons to welcome the immigrants 
this reception is really amazing said ute kindl a young 
east german woman im really speechless over the warmness and 
kindness here 
resettlement camps were overflowing here today one day after 
hungary broke with east germany a warsaw pact ally and allowed 
east germans to cross freely into the west 
bavarian border police said they estimated the number of 
immigrants in west germany at over 10000 
there were conflicting reports about how many east germans had 
crossed into hungary since monday morning maj janos hornyak of the 
hungarian border guards said 6529 east germans arrived between 630 
am monday and 930 am today 
he said all but 1181 entered from czechoslovakia which is 
sandwiched between hungary and east germany and the rest entered 
from romania 
in the czechoslovak capital of prague witnesses said more than 
half of the 400 east germans holed up in the west german embassy 
today left the grounds today 
several refugees said east germany had promised not to punish 
them if they returned home and would let them apply to emigrate to 
the west the refugees had camped out in hopes of being allowed to 
emigrate to west germany like their countrymen in hungary 
the remarkable path westward was cut by hungary which is 
embracing liberal political reforms and seeking closer economic and 
diplomatic ties with western nations 
east germans have used hungarys looser borders to flee to the 
west for years that stream turned into a steady flood in may when 
hungary removed many border fortications with western neighbor 
austria and turned into deluge on sunday when thousands of east 
germans vacationing in hungary were allowed to emigrate en masse 
the refugees who came through three separate crossings had 
completely filled five temporary camps near the austrian border in 
bavaria and officials were seeking more shelter in military barracks 
chief federal government spokesman hans klein criticized east 
germany for its public condemnation of the unprecedented exodus 
its not ice age verbiage but rather stone age verbiage that 
they have reacted with klein told a news conference in passau 
late this morning 
soviet politburo hardliner yegor ligachev arrived today in east 
berlin soviet and east german reports said it was expected he 
would discuss the refugee situation with officials 
most of the refugees arrived in private cars and at least 100 
buses bringing them through austria into the southern west german 
state 
michael tietmann director of the tiefenbach refugee camp just 
outside passau said many of the emigres who had cars arrived later 
than expected a lot of them told me they had gone shopping in 
vienna and took in the sights before going on to west germany 
he said 
about 60000 east germans were reported in hungary on sunday 
most of them on vacation but an interior ministry official in 
budapest said monday that 26000 of them had returned home 
east germanys communist government expressed anger at west 
germany and hungary for arranging the exodus but announced no 
immediate retaliation 
east germanys adn news agency accused west germany of luring 
away and misleading citizens of our land through an unrestrained 
slander campaign it said hungary had unilaterally suspended 
agreements between the two countries regulating movement of people 
across borders 
many east germans here expressed fears that their relatives back 
home would face reprisals 
our parents still dont know for sure what we have done 
remarked one young man who arrived with his wife from leipzig the 
couple asked not to be identified by name 
we just hope this wont hurt them they east german security 
officials have a way of making life difficult for people whose 
relatives have fled to the west the man said 
it was not known how long the exodus of east germans out of 
hungary would last or be permitted news reports said the east 
germans might restrict travel to hungary in retaliation but east 
berlin denied the reports 
some of west germanys 613 million citizens have expressed 
concern about how their country can absorb an estimated 100000 east 
germans likely to arrive this year up from nearly 40000 last year 
and the largest number since 207000 fled in 1961 about 400000 
ethnic germans from other soviet bloc countries also are expected to 
arrive this year 
chancellor helmut kohl on monday said his countrymen expressing 
discontent were insensitive 
we have no right to resist the search for personal happiness of 
our countrymen from east germany he said 
while west german unemployment is about 9 percent not enough 
young people are signing up for apprenticeship programs to work as 
craftsmen and most of the east german refugees are young craftsmen 
klein the government spokesman said officials received 8000 
job offers in passau alone for the refugees 
inside passaus sprawling niebelungen halle civic center the 
west german red cross and other relief groups had set up tiered bunk 
beds kitchens and consultation centers for other new emigres 
hundreds of people gathered in front of the center to greet the 
arriving east germans 
hungarys action marks the first time a warsaw pact country has 
aided a mass exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation the 
exodus is the biggest since the berlin wall was built 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass condemned western media 
for what it called a tendentious campaign to spur illegal east 
german emigration 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
praised hungary for boldly opening its western border in defiance of 
a warsaw pact ally 
the exodus came after weeks of talks between the two germanys 
failed on sunday night the hungarian government formally announced 
it would allow all east germans to leave for west germany 
before this week about 6000 east germans had already fled this 
summer through hungary

north korea on tuesday proposed 
negotiations to remove us nuclear weapons allegedly in south korea 
and convert the korean peninsula into a nuclearfree zone 
army maj gen choe ui ung saying a us nuclear arms buildup on 
the penisula could start another korean war made the north korean 
proposal at the 451st meeting of the military armistice commission 
in this border truce village 
us navy rear adm larry vogt speaking for the un command 
refused to discuss the communist request on grounds it was a 
political issue and did not come under the jurisdiction of the 
commission which was formed after a 1953 armistice ended the 
threeyear korean war 
the un command led by the united states was formed in 1950 
with 16 foreign countries that rushed troops to help south korea 
repel invaders from the north 
north korea has frequently demanded the united states remove 
nuclear weapons it says are in south korea and it proposed a 
nuclearfree zone at a commission meeting may 9 
us forces have refused to confirm or deny the presence of 
nuclear arms 
vogt charged the communist north with propaganda and misusing the 
commission to rehash trumpedup charges the meeting was called 
by the north 
vogt suggested the meeting of the armistice commission discuss 
proposals to ease tension along the demilitarized zone that 
separates the two koreas 
vogt said joint teams should investigate alleged armistice 
violations and work to return remains of american soldiers who died 
in the korean war north korea has said it has the remains 
choe chief communist delegate to the commission contended the 
united states has deployed a colossal amount of nuclear weapons 
ranging from mininuclear shells and bombs to operational and 
tactical nuclear missiles and constructed a number of storehouses 
for nuclear weapons in at least six areas in the south 
he said unless the nuclear arms are withdrawn and south korea is 
converted into a nuclearfree zone confrontation and hostile 
feelings cannot be removed nor can confidence be built between both 
sides forever

democrats in texas and california today hope to reclaim two house 
seats in special elections prompted by the resignation of speaker 
jim wright and majority whip tony coelho in a capitol hill 
bloodletting over ethics 
new york mayor edward koch is looking for a comefrombehind 
victory in the democratic primary over david dinkins who could 
become the citys first black mayor and in detroit mayor coleman 
young is expected to brush back a swarm of primary challengers who 
want to keep him from winning a record fifth term in november 
among other elections around the country today are mayoral 
primaries in buffalo ny new haven conn and minneapolis and 
st paul minn 
in the congressional races democrats are basking in the support 
of the leaders they are trying to succeed although wright and 
coelho resigned because of alleged ethics violations both remain 
popular and have been central figures in the campaigns 
wright has campaigned for democrat pete geren a fort worth 
lawyer and former aide to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas geren faces 
republican bob lanier a tv medical commentator who has countered 
with endorsements from president bush and former dallas cowboys 
coach tom landry 
lanier said he initially worried that wrights endorsement would 
be a major factor in the race but now believes it hasnt been 
quite as much as we anticipated 
still he conceded that hes swimming upstream as a 
republican in a district with a long history of sending democrats to 
congress 
in californias san joaquin valley coelho has endorsed 
democratic state assemblyman gary condit in a lowkey race against 
republican clare berryhill a former assemblyman and state 
agriculture chief 
berryhill and condit are considered the leading candidates among 
the six running unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of 
the vote there will be a runoff 
the new york city race once considered a lost cause for koch 
has turned into a cliffhanger between the brash mayor and his 
softspoken challenger 
koch sent out an sos call to his supporters monday saying he 
needed a big turnout to win his partys nomination for an 
unprecedented fourth term 
im saying to everybody who understands that expression i 
need you come out tomorrow vote for me mayday mayday koch 
said at a lunchtime rally 
at a school dedication koch pulled dinkins aside to call for a 
unity rally on wednesday no matter who wins 
i think thats a nice gesture said a smiling dinkins who is 
the manhattan borough president i mean he recognizes that the 
likelihood is that im going to succeed and he offers to help me i 
think thats fine 
koch said it was important for his party to work on defeating 
republican rudolph giuliani the former federal prosecutor who leads 
cosmetic heir ronald lauder in the gop race 
in detroit young faces a dozen challengers including rep john 
conyers a 13term democratic congressman who says young has been 
mayor too long

thousands of voters ditched norways two 
largest parties in general elections and analysts tuesday gave the 
governing labor party coalition only a 5050 chance to survive a 
rightwing challenge 
neither grouping got a majority in parliament from mondays 
balloting and conservatives must gain the support of an 
increasingly popular farright party if they hope to topple prime 
minister gro harlem brundtland 
mrs brundtland whose party suffered its greatest postwar 
defeat said she will remain in office until opponents oust her 
minority government the nonsocialist parties planned meetings next 
week to discuss forming a coalition 
voters fed up with high unemployment rising prices and little 
perceived difference between the labor and conservative parties 
streamed to the farright party of progress and the socialist left 
the analysts said 
this election was marked by enormous changes and just the same 
nothing changed said political scientist lars svaasand of the 
university of bergen 
whichever side succeeds it probably will control a minority with 
limited ability to complete norways economic recovery svaasand 
said 
the vg newspaper called it the election that norway lost 
there is a clear polarization in the system both the largest 
parties suffered setbacks but the conservatives were the big 
loser said analyst bernt ole aardal of the institute for social 
research 
analysts gave mrs brundtland roughly equal chances of remaining 
in government with some suggesting she might be forced out 
initially but regain power over the divisive nonsocialist bloc 
to gain power the opposition bloc must come to terms with the 
progress party of carl i hagen who challenges the foundations of 
norways social democracy the party soared from two seats in the 
1985 parliament to 22 in the new one 
the nonsocialist bloc won a slim majority of 84 seats to 80 for 
labor and the allied socialist left which doubled its strength the 
single independent anders aune will probably support labor still 
norways largest party 
hagen said he will support a vote to topple mrs brundtland but 
warned that if he is not included in a coalition his party will be 
another opposition party 
if they want the benefit of our support it is at the cost of 
our having influence he said 
the other nonsocialist parties dont want anything to do with 
the progress party but they may be forced into cooperating 
svaasand said 
aardal said relations in the nonsocialist bloc are tense and 
that it will take a while until we see a solution for the whole 
period 
my guess is that the government will operate on an 
issuebyissue basis but that doesnt necessarity mean that it will 
be inefficient and unstable it has happened many times before in 
norwegian history he said

a lawyer for inmates at the county jail asked a 
judge today to release up to 500 prisoners early because of a 
bacterial infection that has killed two inmates and sickened as many 
as 35 others 
james oitzinger also asked us district judge james deanda to 
isolate inmates at risk of contracting the illness either because 
they already are sick or have impaired immune systems 
the hearing was expected to continue through the day 
a bacterial infection known as pneumococcus bacteremia killed two 
inmates thursday according to doctors they said the two ages 21 
and 30 had had their spleens removed leaving them more susceptible 
to the infection 
since then 18 more inmates have been admitted to ben taub 
hospital and at least 17 are in the jail infirmary reporting 
flulike symptoms authorities said cultures indicated pneumococcus 
bacteria in five of the inmates at ben taub one of whom is missing 
his spleen and is in very critical condition dr stephen greenberg 
an infectious disease expert at baylor college of medicine said 
monday 
we dont ever see five cases of pneumococcal bacteremia coming 
from one place at one time greenberg said bacteremia is an 
infection that attacks virtually all bodily systems 
the cause of the other inmates symptoms is not yet known and 
neither are the source of the outbreak and exactly how it spreads 
doctors said 
greenberg said outbreaks have been seen in the military and among 
south african miners groups that live in crowded conditions 
the harris county jail designed for 4200 inmates houses about 
8300 although no specific measures were ordered by health 
authorities jail officials canceled religious services 
recreational activities and classes 
oitzinger who represents inmates in a suit over jail 
overcrowding asked for early release of up to 500 inmates in jail 
on misdemeanor charges 
at the hearing sheriff johnny klevenhagen testified that medical 
experts told him the outbreak was not caused by overcrowding the 
jails not the breeding place and certainly not the environment 
for the illness he said 
two doctors from the centers for disease control in atlanta 
toured the jail monday with state and local health officials but 
declined to comment on their findings or plans to curb the spread of 
the bacteria 
authorities were preparing to screen 3200 inmates who indicated 
they at risk of contracting the infection 
klevenhagen said he expects the number to be narrowed to about 
500 once health officials question the group about any chronic 
illnesses and immunesystem problems

gunmen believed to be sinhalese 
radicals killed the sisterinlaw of former president junius 
rjayewardene at a traffic intersection in downtown colombo on 
tuesday police said 
gladys jayewardene 72 was gunned down by two men on a 
motorcycle police said 
no one claimed responsibility for the killing but police blamed 
the peoples liberation front a sinhalese extremist group that has 
been trying to overthrow the government since 1987 
mrs jayewardene the wife of the former presidents younger 
brother ronald was the chairwoman of the state pharmaceutical 
corp a governmentowned firm responsible for distributing medicine 
many of the drugs sold by the pharmaceutical corporation are 
imported from neighboring india which sent peacekeeping troops to 
sri lanka two years ago the deployment of the troops sparked a 
violent protest by the peoples liberation front including a demand 
to boycott indian goods 
military officials blamed the radical group for 12 other deaths 
in the countrys south and center since monday at least three 
people were killed in fighting between indian soldiers and tamils 
rebels in the north 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said police found the bodies of 11 unidentified sinhalese men on 
tuesday in panadura town 15 miles south of colombo 
on monday the director of a private supermarket chain was 
abducted from his car at gunpoint and killed the officials said 
they said rs pereras body was found in kahawita a colombo suburb 
the killings occurred as the government prepared to meet leaders 
of opposition parties wednesday in a bid to end the ethnic violence 
the violence was sparked by a tamil movement for a separate 
nation in the northeast tamils who make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people claim the sinhalesedominated government 
deprives them of jobs and education 
junius jayewardenes government attempted to end the insurgency 
with an indiasponsored peace accord in july 1987 but it was 
rejected by the largest rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam who said it did not grant enough concessions to the tamils 
the tigers turned their guns on indian peacekeeping troops 
deployed to monitor the accord 
besides the tamil violence the sinhalese fronts campaign has 
claimed 5000 lives since 1987 most victims have been sinhalese a 
community that makes up 75 percent of the population 
the group protests the july accord saying it gave too many 
concessions to the tamils and compromised the countrys independence 
by inviting indian soldiers to sri lanka 
president ranasinghe premadasa has invited the sinhalese front to 
wednesdays meeting but the guerrilla group has not responded it 
has rejected at least five calls from the government for ceasefires 
two tamil tiger representatives will attend the meeting as 
observers government officials said tuesday they said most of the 
23 political parties have accepted premadasas invitation

senate democrats today pushed for a 22 
billion expansion of president bushs antidrug plan but top 
administration officials immediately said they would urge a veto if 
the proposal reaches the white house 
in a statement released by the office of management and budget 
administration officials said bushs 79 billion proposal made 
the tough choices while the democratic alternative throws money 
at the plan 
the clash came as sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the 
appropriations committee formally proposed the legislation with the 
backing of senate majority leader george mitchell 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas also said the 
democratic proposal was too expansive and legislative leaders met 
off the senate floor to discuss the measure which byrd sought to 
add to the transportation appropriations bill 
secretary of defense richard cheney drug policy coordinator 
william j bennett budget director richard darman and other senior 
advisers will recommend to the president that he veto the democratic 
plan the omb statement said 
meanwhile bennett told the house foreign affairs committee 
today i dont think its unreasonable to say that we are talking 
about a 50 billion program over five years to fight drugs 
but several members told him it would be unacceptable for the 
administration to find those funds by shifting money out of other 
vital domestic programs 
chairman dante fascell dfla told bennett i dont want to 
see one dime diverted from from essential domestic purposes that are 
in fact part of the drug problem i think that would be a tragic 
mistake 
fascell said funds should not be shifted from such programs as 
education health welfare housing or from programs designed to 
help communities deal with the impact of largescale legal and 
illegal immigration 
that doesnt help communities win the drug fight fascell 
said 
bennett suggested that a large percentage of the needed money may 
come from drug users themselves in the form of heay fines imposed on 
drug offenders 
substantially increased fines will come back into the 
treasury he said 
byrd said monday his plan would increase the governments 
antidrug budget by 39 billion above the level congress would have 
otherwise provided to pay for the extra spending byrd proposed 
acrosstheboard cuts in many domestic and defense programs of 0575 
percent 
he may have the best solution on the funding side of the 
equation dole said of byrds proposal before debate began im 
not certain of the amount but perhaps thats something we can work 
out 
byrd said monday he was seeking to transfer money to drug 
spending from other programs because bush has refused to consider 
tax increases 
the president says read my lips byrd told reporters he 
says he wont support any increase in taxes so i have to do what i 
can do 
byrd whose panel oversees about half of all federal spending 
said he would introduce the proposal as an amendment to the 119 
billion transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 that 
bill also contains language permanently banning cigarette smoking on 
all domestic airline flights 
byrd not only topped the dollars bush would spend but said his 
proposed acrosstheboard cuts were fairer than what the president 
proposed 
last tuesday bush asked congress to increase antidrug efforts 
by 717 million he said he would trim a handful of programs 
including immigration aid rural development housing and a defense 
department radio system the president has ruled out a tax increase 
to pay for the new drug spending 
the drug epidemic facing this country is a crisis that affects 
us all byrd told reporters in my view it is critical that we 
look for solutions that will seek to spread not only the pain but 
also the gain in a fair and evenhanded manner 
the funds byrd proposed spending include 1 billion for new 
prisons 200 million to help state and local law enforcement 
agencies 81 million for new federal attorneys 97 million for the 
fbi and 59 million for the drug enforcement administration 
he would also spend 11 billion for drug and alcohol treatment 
289 million for education 45 million for customs agents 43 
million for the customs service to buy new helicopters and 
airplanes 100 million to help drugaddicted veterans and 100 
million for public housing authorities to deal with drug problems 
of the extra spending byrd said 53 percent would go to law 
enforcement and 47 percent to education treatment and prevention 
programs 
social security and other benefit programs would be exempted from 
his spending cuts byrd said 
because the pentagon budget will be close to 300 billion next 
year the cut in defense spending would total more than 15 billion 
byrd said when he explained his amendment to senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine he liked it 
he also said he had spoken to the democratic chairmen of most of 
the 13 appropriations subcommittees and to the ranking republican on 
the committee mark hatfield of oregon 
his reaction was positive he said

disabled activists are disturbed by recent court 
rulings that let quadriplegics choose death over life with 
paralysis a trend they contend subtly encourages the disabled to 
end it all 
advocates for the disabled say the case of larry mcafee the 
atlanta man who won a court order allowing him to shut off the 
ventilator that has kept him alive since 1985 is but one example 
of what happens when state health systems fail to give their 
disabled patients a chance at life outside of hospitals and state 
institutions 
paul k longmore a california historian and quadriplegic said 
institutionalized care for the disabled is the norm in most states 
many states are like that longmore said essentially 
states like georgia give disabled people two choices the 
nursing home or the cemetery 
mcafee 33 was injured four years ago in a motorcycle crash he 
received athome care until his health insurance ran dry then he 
became a ward of the state 
no nursing home in georgia could take him in social workers 
arranged for him to live in an ohio facility but that home returned 
mcafee to georgia in january 
he lived in the intensive care unit of an atlanta hospital until 
august when he went to a nursing home in alabaster ala 
before he left mcafee asked a fulton county judge to let him 
die saying he could no longer cope with being paralyzed from the 
chin down mcafees court petition came on the heels of a similar 
request from a michigan quadriplegic david rivlin who carried out 
his wish in july 
year after year day after day it just slowly drains 
everything you have mcafee said at a news conference last weekend 
mcafees lawyer randall davis said tuesday his clients wish to 
die stemmed from his abhorrence to being dependent on other 
people for his care 
the cost of his care in his situation and that there are no 
resources left for him was a factor but not the predominant 
factor davis said 
mcafee has not said when he plans to end his life 
when superior court judge edward johnson granted mcafees 
petition to turn off his life support system he said mcafees 
desire to die outweighed the states interest in preserving life 
that ruling and the one in michigan were scary said longmore 
43 who has used a ventilator for 25 years since being crippled by 
polio 
these two coming together within two months have really shaken 
a lot of people up he said i hear a lot of people saying they 
are fed up with the bigotry that says we are better off dead 
but davis said a lot of these people making these statements 
dont know larry mcafee at all he says he doesnt like to be 
dependent on anybody else 
georgia attorney general michael bowers said the state cannot 
interfere in a competent adults decision to stop living 
mark johnson a counselor at an atlanta spinal center and a 
paraplegic called the states attitude cavalier 
its real interesting how the discussion of suicide turned into 
a discussion of refusal of medical treatment he said 
briefs filed in support of mcafees decision by bowers the 
roman catholic archidocese of atlanta and the georgia medical 
association probably didnt help mcafees morale longmore said 
hes getting a lot of messages from nonhandicapped people 
telling him that he really is better off dead longmore said 
the only people who are telling him they want him to try to live 
are other disabled people 
and here we are among the most devalued people in society 
what kind of credibility do we have 
longmore said he was particularly disturbed that the judge 
directed the state to appeal the decision to the georgia supreme 
court but didnt force mcafee to await the outcome 
such an order he said is the first time any state in this 
country has tried to set up legally assisted suicide for disabled 
people 
inevitably people with disabilities will be pressured into 
choosing suicide he said thats extremely dangerous 
mark johnson questioned whether states try to prevent the sense 
of inadequacy felt by mcafee and rivlin who disconnected himself 
from a life support machine and died july 20 after winning a court 
battle rivlin 38 had been on a respirator since a 1971 surfing 
accident and wanted to die rather than become bitter because he had 
no hope for recovery 
why would anybody be allowed to get to that point to where they 
feel that way johnson asked how are you supposed to feel good 
about yourself 
i dont want to see mcafee die longmore said i know how 
hard it is i know if i had gone through the same kind of battering 
by the system i would want to die too 
i also know it doesnt have to be that way

president bush told soviet maverick boris 
yeltsin his administration enjoys a very positive relationship 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev the white house said today 
the president met with the soviet official an outspoken critic 
of some of gorbachevs policies for about 15 minutes according to 
a statement by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the statement said bush dropped by a meeting between yeltsin 
and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
fitzwater earlier had suggested that the session would be little 
more than a handshake between the president and the visiting soviet 
figure saying we dont want to do anything to foster internal 
conflict that might be associated with this trip 
however fitzwaters later statement said the meeting included 
discussion of overall ussoviet relations and of drugs 
yeltsin said in a speech prior to the meeting that he wanted to 
tell bush we have to combine our efforts to rescue perestroika 
which is in a supercritical situation today 
the president said that there is much interest in mr yeltsins 
visit he expressed his view that the overall bilateral relationship 
is in good shape said fitzwaters statement 
in this connection the president noted his very positive 
relationship with general secretary gorbachev and reiterated his 
support for perestroika it continued 
the president emphasized that the american people share his 
hope for the success of the reform movement in the soviet union 
the short statement added 
vice president dan quayle also dropped by to greet yeltsin 
the statement said 
fitzwater said bush met with yeltsin shortly before his 
nationally televised antidrug speech to school children 
the spokesman said the president mentioned the speech to the 
soviet official and the problem that drugs have created throughout 
the world the president and mr yeltsin both agreed that drugs are 
a major problem that touches on both american and soviet societies 
the 58yearold yeltsin ousted as moscows communist party chief 
in 1987 but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular 
support in a contested election arrived saturday on a private tour 
he has been prodding mikhail gorbachev to step up the pace of reform 
in the soviet union 
we didnt want to indicate that we were trying to provide a 
platform for dissent fitzwater said 
yeltsin also was to meet with secretary of state james a baker 
iii and sens bill bradley dnj and barbara milkulski dmd 
he announed monday night that he would cut short his us visit 
to go home to attend meetings on pressure from various nationalities 
for independence from the kremlin 
in his speech today at johns hopkins university in baltimore 
yeltsin said perestroika had not improved the delivery of food and 
other consumer goods to the soviet people 
he repeated earlier statements that unless gorbachev improves the 
consumer goods situation in the soviet union he faces an upheaval 
from below he has said gorbachev has six months to a year to 
achieve progress 
i have a lot to tell president bush yeltsin said but did 
not spell out what requests he might make of the us government 
white house officials had said monday the administration did not 
want to send the wrong signal to gorbachev by having bush meet with 
yeltsin who has been prodding the soviet leader to speed reforms 
in a questionandanswer session with reporters yeltsin said he 
approved of the exodus of thousands of east germans through hungary 
to west germany where they have been granted citizenship 
it should be regulated by international agreements stating that 
people have the right to live where they want yeltsin said 
speaking monday evening at columbia university yeltsin said the 
kremlin has suppressed numerous peoples in its power for too long 
the feeling of national dignity was constantly being crushed in 
our country he said through an interpreter if they even wanted 
to build a school they had to go hat in hand so to speak to 
moscow it was very offensive 
giving soviet republics more power to govern themselves would 
greatly reduce tensions he said 
the problem is serious enough he said that he was cutting his 
twoweek tour by a week to attend a special meeting in moscow to 
discuss the nationalities issue if the problem is to be solved the 
ruling politburo must be reinvigorated with progressivethinking 
leaders yeltsin said 
we have so many odious and incompetent people in the 
politburo he said all they do is raise questions and never 
answer them they are hanging on to their positions with dear life 
we need to catapult them out like they do with ejection seats but 
the question is who is willing to push the button 
he said the soviet people should throw off our false pride and 
take a lot from the american experience of running a country 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
said yeltsins views were his own and not necessarily the 
governments 
yeltsins visit is organized by the esalen institute 
sovietamerican exchange program he is receiving 25000 per 
speech which will pay for the trip and contribute to aids research 
in the soviet union

an administrative law judge ordered the 
colt firearms division to rehire 800 strikers with back pay a 
ruling the union said could mean as much as 40 million for workers 
who have picketed for 3 years 
the decision by judge marvin roth although not final delighted 
striking members of the united auto workers 
theyre jumping up and down robert madore a regional uaw 
official they cant believe we won the whole decision 
madore estimated back wages at 40 million an average of 
50000 per worker 
this is wonderful said marie lambert who worked for colt 
for 14 years before the strike there havent been any christmas 
presents for my kids for the past three years 
roth in a ruling dated thursday and released monday found that 
the gun maker had engaged in unfair labor practices during the 
strike 
the company has until oct 5 to appeal to the national labor 
relations board if neither side appeals the board will adopt 
roths decision said john sauter assistant regional director for 
the board in hartford 
michael g dunn a spokesman for colt industries in new york 
said colt had not yet decided whether to appeal 
about 1050 workers walked off the job at colt plants in hartford 
and west hartford in january 1986 after working 10 months without a 
contract 
the division which was put up for sale by colt industries in 
april kept the plants operating with replacements and about 200 
union members who crossed picket lines 
the judge found that colt unilaterally changed working 
conditions failed to bargain in good faith offered to settle 
separately with employees who quit the union and rejected a 1986 
offer to have strikers return under their old contract 
roth dismissed colts allegations that its negotiators had been 
threatened by the union but found that union members had threatened 
people and property during picketing he ordered an end to such 
behavior 
a state board ruled in 1988 that the colt workers were victims of 
a lockout and entitled to millions in unemployment benefits colt 
has appealed that decision 
colt was founded in 1836 by samuel colt inventor of the first 
successful repeating pistol the company later developed its 
sixshooter the legendary gun that won the west it also makes the

the state department strengthened its ban on 
sugar imports from panama today by denying that country any share of 
a quota increase being allocated to sugarexporting countries 
in addition the department said the administration is expanding 
the list of panamanian companies and individuals affiliated with the 
panamanian government to which americans cannot make payments 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the actions are a direct 
result of the continued unwillingness of gen manuel antonio noriega 
to respect the will of the panamanian people by stepping down and 
permitting the installation of a freely elected government 
as part of the economic sanctions the united states imposed 
against the central american country last year panamas sugar quota 
was suspended and cost the panamanian government 15 million in 
revenues ms tutwiler said 
panamas share of a general quota increase announced by the 
office of the special trade representative would have been 23403 
tons she added 
ms tutwiler had no additional information on the expanded list 
of panamanian companies and individuals to which the americans 
cannot make payments 
the administration has refrained from imposing sanctions on china 
after the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement on grounds that 
such action would hurt the chinese people asked why the 
administration does not apply the same rationale to panama ms 
tutwiler said noriega is hurting the panamanian people more by 
refusing to step down 
the administration took the new actions 12 days after 
noriegadominated council of state selected a longtime noriega 
associate to be panamas unelected president 
at the time the administration said it would have no diplomatic 
dealings with the new leadership

armbands rallied to cheer escaped leaders of chinas prodemocracy 
student movement tuesday the 100th day since its suppression

chinatown section to commemorate victims of the crackdown other 
protests were held in taiwan and the portuguese territory of macao 
chinas state media did not mention the day 
many of hong kongs favorite pop singers performed during a 
nearly threehour concert to mark the day but the loudest cheers 
were for leaders of the movement who escaped chinese authorities

is to return to chinese rule in 1997 
police estimated the crowd at more than 20000 while organizers 
said it could be up to 50000

downtown monument to war dead the lanterns were in the shape of the 
tents used by chinese students who occupied tiananmen square before 
the crackdown

concert tuesday in a taiwan park despite heavy rains from typhoon

chief 
at the ceremony a refugee played a tape of gunshots that rang 
out in beijing when soldiers moved in to end the movement 
it is important to remember what happened and why it 
happened said a chinese poet duo duo today is a day to 
remember tiananmen which was a humiliation to us all to humanity 
and for all mankind

here is a text of president bushs remarks 
tuesday to the nations school children concerning drugs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you know somehow the fall always feels like a time to start 
over a time full of possibility and everyone gets a new chance 
now i know there are americans of every age watching and to 
those at home or at work i ask you to talk with your families and 
coworkers about drug abuse presidents dont often get the chance 
to talk directly to students and so today for each of you sitting 
in a classroom or assembly hall this message goes straight to you 
when i was thinking about what i wanted to say to you today about 
drugs i tried to put myself in your place to look at it from your 
perspective but you know the harder i tried the harder it got 
it may seem to you that your parents and your teachers grew up in 
simpler times but most of them lived through the civil rights 
struggles some of your fathers fought in vietnam and for many of 
you your parents and teachers were among the first to face drugs 
if you care enough to talk to them you might be surprised at how 
much they do understand 
i used to play baseball i knew id never make the big leagues 
but i made a lot of friends friends i learned to count on both on 
and off the field and we trusted each other to come through no 
matter how tough it got and i learned from that i learned that the 
kind of people you make your friends can either give you strength or 
take it away 
im not sure why it is but some people just make you find the 
best in yourself they can help you become a better person help you 
discover more of who you are there are others who may seem like 
friends but theyre not and they prove it every time they offer you 
drugs 
every day with a thousand small decisions youre shaping your 
future its a future that ought to be bright with potential and 
most of you are doing the right thing but for those who let drugs 
make their decisions for them you can almost hear the doors 
slamming shut 
it isnt worth it we know that now attitudes that once 
encouraged or excused drug use have changed among high school 
seniors cocaine use has dropped by about a fifth and overall drug 
use is at the lowest levels in 10 years 
but even if you dont use drugs you ought to be angry about them 
because you are being cheated by those who do add it all adds up 
drug and alcohol abuse cost this country billions of dollars a year 
and i dont know how to quantify the human suffering that drugs 
cause but i do know we are all paying for it we are all feeling it 
every day 
every time someone does drugs or sells drugs or even just looks 
the other way they are supporting an industry that costs more than 
money it costs lives each of you has a decision to make and dozens 
of chances to make it at a party on the street in the school 
parking lot and parents teachers coaches politicians 
presidents no one else can make that decision for you 
but if you talk to someone you trust they may remind you of 
whats at stake yes its your decision i cant tell you how to 
make it but i will tell you what it means 
you all watch tv you see the news the crime the devastation 
every dollar that goes to drugs fuels the killing as long as there 
are americans willing to buy drugs there will be people willing to 
sell drugs and people willing to kill as a cost of doing business 
there is a connection between the suppliers and even occasional 
or weekend users that can never be forgotten casual drug use is 
responsible for the casualties of the drug war from the city 
streets of america to the street bombings of colombia even dabblers 
in drugs bear responsibility for the blood being spilled and unlike 
those of you in school this fall those killed by the drug trade 
never do get a second chance 
drugs are rightly called an equal opportunity destroyer they 
have no conscience they dont care where the money comes from they 
just murder people young and old good and bad innocent and 
guilty it doesnt matter for too many drugs mean death 
i keep this badge i keep this badge in my drawer desk to remind 
me of that it was worn by a young rookie cop named eddie byrne 22 
years old not much older than some of you he was out trying to 
stop the drug trade protecting a witness so that a dealer could be 
brought to justice eddie byrne had three brothers a girlfriend 
hed known for four years he loved fishing and football he was a 
running back at plain edge high school in new york and he had a 
lot of friends in his neighborhood and eddie byrne had dreams but 
in the early hours of a cold february morning sitting in a police 
cruiser eddie was blown away at pointblank range killed on the 
orders of a drug kingpin cold and calculated 
ive heard some say if you do drugs now and then well youre 
not hurting anybody its no big deal well the next time you 
think about using drugs i want you to think of eddie byrne and i 
want you to think about the family that lost him to me this badge 
is a constant reminder that eddie byrnes life was not given in 
vain this is a promise the killing must and will stop 
more

where youre sitting right now or youre sitting there in 
school i know youve got your dreams everyone does but out on the 
street a nightmare for america is happening every day every night 
somewhere a teenaged girl who ought to be in school is giving birth 
to a baby already addicted to cocaine and that baby is coming into 
this world shaking and twitching from withdrawal so sensitive to 
the touch that it cant be held or fed properly 
how can drugs cause so much pain how can they lead brothers to 
kill brothers and mothers to abandon children and behind all of 
the senseless violence the needless tragedy what haunts me is the 
question why 
i have one answer drugs are still a problem because too many of 
us are still looking the other way and thats why i wanted to talk 
to you today i am asking you not to look the other way 
maybe you are in trouble or on the edge of trouble maybe you 
know someone who is maybe youve got younger brothers or sisters 
you know they are looking up to you dont risk your life or theirs 
and if you are struggling with the kind of problem that can truly be 
the toughest if you have parents who have problems with drugs or 
alcohol find someone you can trust talk to them about it 
you know all of you in a classroom know whos got a problem 
today i am not just asking you to get help im asking you to find 
someone who needs you and offer to help ill say it again if 
youre not in trouble help someone who is 
we all want to succeed and ill let you in on a secret we all 
can succeed if you dont use drugs you can be anything you want to 
be 
maybe youve heard michael jordan say youve got at least 
three quarters of your life to go thats three more lifetimes to 
use so dont blow it 
saying no wont make you a nerd wont make you a loser in fact 
it will make you more friends than drugs ever will real friends 
but if thats not enough reason there is another side 
using illegal drugs is against the law and if you break the law 
you pay the price because the rules have changed if you do drugs 
you will be caught and when you are caught you will be punished 
you might lose your drivers license some states have started 
revoking users driving privileges or you might lose the college 
loan you wanted because we are not helping those who break the law 
these are privileges not rights and if you risk doing drugs you 
risk everything even your freedom because you will be punished 
now i can imagine a few whispers out there maybe you think 
well never get drugs under control that its too easy for the 
dealers to get back on the street well those days are over too 
the revolving door just jammed 
some think there wont be room for them in jail well make room 
were almost doubling prison space some think there arent enough 
prosecutors well hire them with the largest increase in federal 
prosecutors in history the day of the dealer is drawing to a close 
no matter who you are or how strong you are drugs take control 
of your life but without drugs youre in control you can 
determine your future and that means staying in school if youre 
thinking about dropping out think it through maybe you know 
somebody who wants to quit school talk to them about it and if you 
have friends who have already dropped out talk to them too find a 
way to bring them back 
today ive asked you to think about the terrible cost drugs are 
making us all pay every day but even more important im asking you 
to think about what you can do to make a difference for someone else 
last winter after i was sworn in as president i said that from 
now on in america any definition of a successful life must include 
serving others helping others and i hope you all believe that 
theres a story about a young boy and an old man who are walking 
along a beach and as they walked the boy picked up each starfish 
he passed and threw it into the sea and the old man asked him why 
if i left them here the boy said they would dry up in the 
sun and die im saving their lives 
but the beach goes on for miles and there are millions of 
starfish the old man said how can what youre doing make any 
difference at all 
and the boy looked at the starfish in his hand threw it out into 
the ocean and answered it makes a difference to this one 
youre here to make a difference for yourself and those around 
you so learn to count on each other take care of each other give 
someone else another chance and make the days mean something 
have a good year and god bless you

parliament on tuesday approved the first 
government in the east bloc not led by communists giving half the 
seats to solidarity but reserving the key ministries controlling 
defense and police for the communists 
for the first time in half a century poland has a government 
that can be considered by millions of people as their own said 
solidarity leader lech walesa from gdansk where the independent 
movement struggled through eight years of communist repression to 
its triumph 
my biggest dream has come true said prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki also of solidarity after his cabinet was approved by a 
vote of 402 in favor none against and 13 abstentions 
the new cabinet called the council of ministers includes 
mazowiecki 11 solidarity members and a foreign minister 
independent but sympathetic to solidarity the communists have four 
seats 
the solidarityaligned united peasant party holds four seats and 
solidaritys other coalition partner the democratic party has 
three 
the communists in addition to controlling the army and police 
will retain considerable influence through president wojciech 
jaruzelski a communist the new government also has promised 
allegiance to the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance 
still mazowiecki once a political prisoner promised an 
overhaul of communist institutions in an eloquent speech that he was 
forced to interrupt for 45 minutes when he felt faint from 
exhaustion 
he called for reforming the police and the justice system 
liberalizing laws on associations gatherings and censorship 
creating a new democratic constitution removing political and 
ideological barriers to promotion giving universities full autonomy 
and battling catastrophic environmental pollution 
the main focus was polands economy mazowiecki said the ranks of 
the poor were swelling and warned that production and living 
standards already lower than 10 years ago were likely to decline 
further 
the new government will act under the pressure that at any 
moment the construction of democracy that only just started can 
collapse under the economic crisis he said 
he called for immediate steps to combat tripledigit inflation 
including tax reform making the zloty convertible with western 
currency and creating a stock exchange 
mazowiecki a solidarity newspaper editor who became the east 
blocs first noncommunist prime minister rejected a past when the 
communist government wanted to rule not only over the lives but 
the minds of poles 
poland can be lifted only by a society of free citizens and by 
a government that enjoys the confidence of the clear majority of 
society he said 
marian orzechowski the politburo member who heads the communist 
parliament delegation rose to support mazowiecki 
my party is not going into opposition orzechowski said we 
will govern together and together be responsible for the fate of 
the nation 
in the soviet union foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said we are prepared to cooperate with the new 
government and develop our relations with poland 
state department spokesman margaret tutwiler said in washington 
the approval of the new government is another step in what has 
been a historical process of transformation 
the new government can count on our continued support she 
said 
a succession of onceinconceivable events led to the moment when 
mazowiecki celebrated the new government with the v for victory 
sign and when jacek kuron who spent nine years in prison for his 
activism sipped champagne as the new labor minister 
the communist party realizing it was unable to control economic 
and social tensions alone began negotiating early this year with 
solidarity which it had sought to crush after declaring it illegal 
in december 1981 
the april accords that resulted from the roundtable talks 
led to the restoration of solidaritys legal status and 
unprecedented democratic elections in june solidarity won those 
elections decisively 
walesa negotiated a coalition with the united peasant and 
democratic parties which had been docile communist allies 
mazowiecki became prime minister aug 24 after gen czeslaw kiszczak 
was unable to form a communistled government and resigned 
in addition to the defense and interior ministries the 
communists will run the strategically important transportation 
ministry they also retain a degree of responsibility for the 
economy through the foreign trade ministry 
mazowiecki told parliament he came as a man of solidarity 
faithful to the legacy of august 1980 when solidarity became the 
first legal independent union in the east bloc 
the legacy of august is also the ability to overcome disputes 
and divisions the ability to find partnership and renounce the idea 
of taking revenge for the past he said 
after 40 minutes mazowiecki looking exhausted asked for a 
recess he was examined and a doctor said fatigue was to blame 
returning he said i am very sorry but this is a result of 
several weeks of too intensive work and i have reached the same 
condition as the polish economy but i have overcome it and i hope 
the economy will do it as well

students returning to class this fall are returning home if their 
hairs too long or skirts too short as more high schools across 
the country enact new hair and dress codes to impose official ideas 
of fashion 
but some parents and students say theres too much ado about 
hairdos and the clothes kids wear they argue that long hair or 
tattered jeans tell little about how a student will do in class 
several texas school systems have new dress codes mostly aimed 
at offensive or suggestive tshirts and baltimore schools banned 
furs costly jewelry and leather coats dozens of other systems 
including some in michigan new york and louisiana adopted 
voluntary dress codes for schools to consider 
a houston father filed a lawsuit tuesday against school 
officials accusing them of sexual discrimination and civil rights 
violations for barring his two sons from class for a second 
consecutive year because of their long hair 
in jasper ala a mother complained about an invasion of privacy 
after her son was sent home because his hair was an inch longer than 
allowed by school policy 
his hair doesnt have anything to do with his education 
shelia whitfield said at an angry school board meeting that brought 
comparisons to the individual rights arguments of the 1960s 
so far the courts are on the side of authority 
laurence tribe a harvard university law professor who 
specializes in first amendment issues said the supreme court has 
never dealt directly with the issue and the lower federal courts 
have ruled both ways still he said the high court would likely 
side with school boards if it ruled today 
i think it stretches the free expression clause to apply it in 
schools tribe said the power of compulsory education already 
involves a major intrusion into a persons ability to express 
himself the school board has a broad range of powers over its 
students 
sentiment is growing for stricter dress and hair codes as school 
administrators seek a sense of normalcy and discipline in 
classrooms said gary marx a spokesman for the american association 
of school administrators 
we do see indications here and there that schools are thinking 
about dress codes and how students are attired may affect their 
education and the education of others marx said i think there 
is a sense in society that we sometimes act the way we look 
civil libertarians see the codes as irrelevant to learning 
its very regrettable when educators fail to see that kids have 
rights and that breathing down their necks about ways they should be 
able to express themselves is not encouraging real education said 
leanne kats executive director of the national coalition against 
censorship 
in henry county ga about 100 students picketed the school 
superintendents office late last month when dozens of boys were 
sent home because their hair touched the collar in violation of a 
new policy 
in baltimore schools spokesman dick holden said the new dress 
code was aimed at eliminating the uniform of the drug culture 
he said the banned clothes are too expensive for some students to 
afford leading to violence 
the dress code became a major topic of discussion after some 
violent incidents in our schools involving outsiders stealing or 
attempting to steal jackets or jewelry of our students said 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke clothing had become attractions to 
criminal activity 
in new orleans school board spokeswoman rose peterson said about 
100 schools have adopted some kind of uniform 
she cited three reasons for the policy its a security issue 
when the schools are wearing a uniform its easy to recognize an 
outsider for the parents they perceive it as a lot cheaper and it 
takes the pressure off kids to wear designer clothes 
sometimes both the rules and the reactions are laughable 
in clovis nm a oneyear trial dress code is in effect after 
students rewrote an old one that banned shorts for boys but allowed 
miniskirts for girls in protest some of the boys wore miniskirts 
to school 
the new policy allows shorts and skirts if neither is shorter 
than 5 inches above the knee 
and in san antonio a 13yearold middle school student was 
forced to get rid of two batman emblems emblazoned on each side 
of his head with bleach officials banned him from class until he 
came back with a classic flattop haircut 
many students see the restrictions as arbitrary but others 
including student body president jason thompson of allen high school 
in dallas support policies encouraging neat appearance 
fads come and go thompson said last year when stud 
earrings were allowed for the first time almost everyone went out 
and got his ear pierced but now you dont see earrings that much

in a jammed tent city in 
picturesque bavaria uwe and norma koenig eagerly scan a bulletin 
board offering jobs ranging from bakers assistants to electricians 
for the couple tasting their first day of freedom getting back 
to work is the no 1 priority 
its a little scary said koenig who worked 10 years as a 
welder at a stateowned cooperative factory near leipzig east 
germany 
its going to be difficult at first but we knew that when we 
decided to leave were very optimistic we didnt leave everything 
we owned behind to just give up or fail said koenig 
for most of the thousands of east germans streaming into bavaria 
the tent city in tiefenbach is just a brief stop on the way to other 
facilities set up throughout west germany to help them get started 
in a new life 
as the emigres shower and have their first meals in west germany 
relief workers and area businesses are at work compiling lists of 
job possibilities and lodging 
bulletin boards with scores of job notices have been set up 
inside and outside the tent city 
some large companies and hospitals have parked vans outside the 
camp where they are interviewing potential employees on the spot 
local entrepreneurs have stuffed handbills listing job openings 
under the windshield wipers of the east germans easily recognizable 
trabant sedans 
like most of the temporary residents at the tiefenbach camp the 
koenigs are taking time to decide where they want to live and where 
to find work 
the east german government told us for years what we could and 
could not do said mrs koenig now were going to do whats 
best for us 
the koenigs said they hoped to eventually settle in the dortmund 
area where they have relatives 
most of these people here are young and have had technical 
training of some kind said michael tietmann the director of the 
tent city for them getting a job should not be a big problem 
more than 500 people are staying at the camp nestled in a small 
valley outside tiefenbach nine miles north of passau 
in the crowded camp red cross volunteers scurry through the 
narrow avenues between the tents serving meals giving advice and 
tending babies as their parents rest from the long journey from 
hungary 
most of the east germans will move on within a day tietmann 
said but they are quickly replaced by new arrivals 
uwe brinkmann one of the recent arrivals said he hoped to 
eventually get a job as an elementary schoolteacher again he 
admitted it would take some time to adjust to the west german system 
in east german schools the curriculum is pretty much dominated 
by communist party doctrine he said 
brinkmann said he is prepared to take lesser work temporarily to 
make ends meet 
richard albrecht a 33yearold professional gardener agreed 
the main thing is to get going said the divorced father of 
two children who accompanied him west 
but he said it is also important for him and his fellow 
countrymen that they quickly be allowed to use their skills and 
knowledge in west germany 
ive worked hard and know my profession were not beggars and 
we dont want to be treated like poor cousins we want to work hard 
and earn real money for honest labor albrecht said 
he said he was wary of some of the offers being made to the new 
arrivals 
there are a lot of hucksters out there trying to offer jobs to 
us on the quick for much less than west germans get paid you have 
to be careful albrecht said 
for many of the young and unmarried arrivals thinking about work 
is still far from their minds 
ive been in the west now for two days and im going to enjoy 
myself for awhile said a 22yearold machinist from dresden who 
asked not to be identified by name 
i think ill go to paris and then come back and look for a 
job he said

the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant went 
on alert today when a holding pond containing toxic substances 
neared capacity because of heavy rain authorities said 
state officials disagreed over whether the pond contained 
radioactive substances and what sort of risk a dam break or overflow 
posed 
the pond is at 75 percent capacity with its water 2 feet below 
the point of overflow but the level has been rising a quarter foot 
a day since friday and is still climbing said paul frohardt rocky 
flats program manager for the state health department 
state operations officer len boulas said our concern was not 
so much flood damage but sediment in the pond whose trace elements 
are radioactive and toxic in nature 
however frohardt said a herbicide is the only toxic chemical 
known to be in the pond which could overflow into a creek that 
provides drinking water to westminster thornton and northglenn 
even if that water needed to be discharged today there is not a 
present or substantial health risk to people downstream frohardt 
said 
he said flood damage from a dam break on the pond which has a 
capacity of 23 million gallons could be greater than the risks 
posed by toxic substances 
coincidentally the incident occurred about 1045 am as the 
state division of emergency services was conducting an emergency 
preparedness drill at the plant said boulas 
health department officials were taking samples from the pond at 
midday to determine the toxicity of the pond water boulas said 
officials also were examining the pond itself to see whether it 
might overflow or its dam break 
the division of emergency services drill today involved the 
hypothetical failure of a pond at rocky flats but not the one 
officials became concerned about according to division spokesman 
dave lawton the drill was called off 
it is a normal thing the training exercise but it was 
getting to be too similar to what was happening said lawton 
and as it was playing out some people were responding to look at 
the other situation that took them out of the exercise and it was 
getting too hard to deal with 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons are made at rocky flats 
which is 16 miles northwest of denver and is operated by rockwell 
international for the department of energy 
fbi agents and investigators from the environmental protection 
agency raided rocky flats on june 6 for evidence of illegal dumping 
of hazardous wastes a federal grand jury convened aug 1 to look 
into the matter

the besieged christian enclave police said 
police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in rocket 
howitzer and mortar duels across the lebanese capital which is

the violence came on the eve of a new effort by three arab 
nations to end the violence in lebanon king fahd of saudi arabia 
said he was optimistic about a settlement 
the syrian barrage on the christian region escalated when the

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade widened to 3099 billion from april through june as the 
country suffered its first shortfall in the category covering 
overseas investment earnings in three decades the government 
reported tuesday 
the commerce department said the current account deficit rose by 
2 percent over the januarymarch imbalance of 3039 billion it 
marked the second consecutive quarterly setback and provided fresh 
evidence economists said of how entrenched americas trade 
problems are 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also trade in services 
the deficit in merchandise trade actually narrowed during the 
spring falling by 23 percent to 277 billion the smallest 
imbalance in merchandise trade in more than four years 
however this improvement was offset by the first deficit in the 
services category since 1958 
that category which primarily reflects investment earnings 
between countries registered a deficit of 176 million in the 
second quarter compared with a surplus of 15 billion in the first 
quarter 
analysts called the services deficit an ominous sign as 
foreigners begin to earn more and more on their us investments 
making it even more difficult for the country to close its trade gap 
the negative services payment is a distressing omen we are now 
paying more to foreigners on their us investments than we are 
earning on our assets in foreign countries and that is worrisome 
said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co 
while the spring services deficit was small and could well be 
revised away in coming reports analysts said the trend is clear 
the united states will be forced to transfer more and more wealth 
overseas to service the growing level of foreign holdings in the 
united states 
john hagens senior economist at the wefa group an economic 
consulting company said he expected the services trade category 
would be in deficit throughout the 1990s reflecting the fact that 
the united states is the worlds largest debtor country 
simply put that means foreigners own more in us assets than 
americans own overseas americas net debtor position stood at 
5325 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by 
another 120 billion this year 
many economists predict that us living standards will begin 
declining because financing the growing foreign debt burden will 
make less funds available in this country 
we are a halftrillion dollars in debt to the rest of the world 
and debtors must eventually pay the piper hagens said 
in addition to merchandise and services the third segment of the 
current account deficit us foreign aid payments and pensions to 
americans living overseas fell by 114 percent to 31 billion in 
the spring 
the current account deficit reflects the sum of the deficits in 
services merchandise trade and socalled unilateral transfers 
for the first six months of the year the current account deficit 
ran at an annual rate of 12276 billion down only slightly from 
the 1988 deficit of 12655 billion 
while the 1988 deficit reflected a 12 percent improvement from an 
alltime high of 1437 billion in 1987 many economists predicted 
that the current account will show little improvement this year and 
will actually begin to worsen again in 1990 
they base this pessimism on the deterioration in americas 
investment position and an expected slowdown in merchandise export 
growth reflecting the big rise in the dollars value in the past 
year a higher dollar makes us goods less competitive on overseas 
markets 
the commerce department on friday will report on the monthly 
merchandise trade performance for july in advance of that report 
many economists were expecting the deficit to worsen to around 9 
billion up from junes 817 billion deficit 
at the start of this decade the united states was running 
surpluses in its current account because earnings from american 
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign 
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions the investment 
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985 when the 
united states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
while the united states has been a net debtor for four years the 
country still enjoyed a surplus in investment earnings because many 
of the us investments were older and brought in more of a return 
than the newer foreign investments in this country

the world wildlife fund on tuesday 
urged the 12nation european economic community to rethink its 
timber strategy as it launched a major initiative to save tropical 
forests 
the appeal by the organization was made in a report presented to 
the european parliament the report was aimed at the eec because the 
trade bloc is the largest consumer of tropical hardwood importing 
more than onethird of the worlds annual production 
the report noted that within 80 years there would be no undamaged 
tropical forest if current rates of deforestation continue 
the most urgent need is to increase funds to protect and manage 
these forests the report said urging the eec to set aside 520 
million for this 
chris elliott the world wildlife funds tropical forest expert 
said the funds could be used to increase protected areas of tropical 
forests train more forest rangers and compensate timber producing 
countries for lost revenue 
the group called on the eec to introduce substantial 
initiatives on debt relief to take financial pressure off developing 
countries which depend on timber exports 
elliott said countries mine tropical forests to pay off 
interest on their debt he suggested these countries should be 
encouraged to view their forests as a renewable resource 
the major exporters of tropical timber to the eec based on 1984 
figures were gabon ivory coast cameroon liberia congo ghana 
philippines brazil malaysia indonesia and singapore according to 
the report 
the world wildlife fund founded 28 years ago and based in 
switzerland is the worlds largest private conservation 
organization its aim is to conserve the natural environment and 
ecological processes essential to life on earth 
sometimes called the lungs of the earth tropical forests act 
as a natural pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide and 
producing oxygen if carbon dioxide isnt removed from the 
atmosphere it can trap heat there which some scientists say 
contributes to a global warming trend called the greenhouse 
effect

in a department store kiosk the stern face of 
vladimir i lenin glared out at the bustling crowds and glittery 
goods 
the soviet leaders image wasnt there as a comment on the 
excesses of americas bourgeois consumer culture it was emblazoned 
on a tshirt which trendconscious shoppers could buy for 40 
also being hawked in the perestroika kiosk at bloomingdales 
department store coarse rye bread flown in from a moscow bakery 
for 6 a loaf and heavy outdatedlooking soviet watches for up to 
180 miraed peake smith a store spokeswoman said the items sold 
at a bullmarket pace 
soviet products and western goods made to look like they came 
from the soviet union have suddenly acquired cachet in america 
merchandisers and sovietologists give two reasons for the 
phenomenon americans boundless hunger for novelty and an appetite 
for more understanding of the country in view of the changes wrought 
by president mikhail s gorbachev 
the appeal is that theyre hokey said a woman named mexx 
who sells soviet watches at a market in an affluent manhattan 
neighborhood 
a large part of fashion is antifashion she said of the 
watches that feature large faces heavy casings and canteenlike 
caps that screw on to the stem for an oldfashioned method of 
waterproofing 
i think people like them because theyre grotesque said 
marshall goldman an economist at harvard universitys russian 
research center 
advertisements capitalize on the watches archaic appeal great 
1950s design never died it just defected to moscow chirps the 
catalogue of the sharper image a chain of novelty stores about a 
watch it describes as perfect for threshing wheat at your country 
dacha or going on maneuvers near the chinese border 
portraying the soviet union as just another purveyor of campy 
consumer goods isnt necessarily trivializing the country said kim 
penney vice president of creative licensing corp which markets 
moscow state university tshirts 
were not pretending it is going to bring world peace but 
20 years ago they were the enemy we have to have a better 
understanding of them as people she said 
almost anything can help fill americans knowledge gap about the 
soviet union ms penney said 
when we showed the tshirt to people some thought we made it 
the university up she said 
wearing such garb also might express a more serious assessment of 
the country said ellen chances a professor of russian culture at 
princeton university 
the trend that you see comes from the fact that gorbachev has 
been pushing for real reforms and americans are responding to 
them she said we buy from countries we feel good about dont 
forget that a few years ago liquor stores were boycotting 
stolichnaya vodka 
it is a manifestation of the feeling that buyers are hoping the 
ussr and the united states will have a happy marriage said 
ms smith of bloomingdales 
along with goodwill the vogue also is bringing the soviet union 
badly needed hard currency said economist judy shelton 
ms shelton author of the book the coming soviet crash 
gorbachevs desperate pursuit of western credit said she believes 
the selling of consumer goods will teach them how to market 
products in the west 
but she added i wouldnt call it a first wave of the soviet 
unions becoming a robust trader in the world market soviet goods 
generally tend to be pretty crummy she said 
questions of quality apparently dont bother people who want to 
ride the wave of fashion said mexx the watchseller pointing to a 
watch guarantee written in russian she said they have no idea 
what it says and i plead innocence 
nor was she concerned that soviet chic might be shortlived 
theres always another fad on the horizon 
last year people were interested in spain so i sold spanish 
things she said 
her view was borne out by bloomingdales which took down the 
perestroika boutique last week 
were starting a vive la france promotion ms smith said

us district judge walter nixon told the 
senate on tuesday that the trial that led to his imprisonment on 
perjury charges was a miscarriage of justice and that he wants 
to return as an active federal judge 
nixon 60 has been in prison serving a fiveyear sentence since 
march 1988 but will continue to collect his 89500 annual judges 
salary until he resigns dies or is convicted by the senate on 
impeachment charges 
i was wrongly convicted nixon told a 12member senate panel 
that will summarize the evidence against him for the full senate 
which is trying the judge following his impeachment by the house 
last year 
the case revolves around nixons knowledge of a marijuana 
smuggling case and whether he tried to influence its outcome it 
involved the son of a wealthy businessman in hattiesburg miss who 
had sold nixon lucrative oil properties 
nixon denied to federal investigators and a grand jury that he 
ever discussed the case with anyone that denial was the basis for 
his later conviction on perjury charges 
nixon who remains chief us district judge for the southern 
district of mississippi was appointed by president johnson and is 
the last remaining democrat on the federal bench in that state 
he told the senate committee tuesday the conversations that were 
the central points of his impeachment were not discussions about 
the narcotics case and were was so minor that he never thought to 
mention them to federal investigators or the grand jury 
nixon said that in march 1983 he visited oilman wiley fairchild 
because fairchild had asked him to keep in touch with him after he 
sold him oil property in 1980 
fairchild was mad as hell because his son whod been 
arrested on narcotics charges was causing the fairchild name to 
be dragged through the news media nixon said 
furthermore fairchild said he thought the local prosecutor paul 
bud holmes and another attorney carroll ingram were trying to 
blackmail him into paying more legal fees by getting his son 
indicted in state court said nixon 
i was taken aback said nixon who said he didnt believe 
either lawyer both friends of his would be involved in blackmail 
i thought it was a figment of his imagination said nixon 
the case had already been handled federally and the son drew 
fairchild had arranged a plea bargain that kept him out of jail 
holmes testified last week that at unbeknownst to the elder 
fairchild or nixon he also had arranged a plea bargain with the son 
nixon testified that at one point he went to holmes house to 
borrow some hank williams records when he got there he mentioned to 
holmes what fairchild had said about blackmail 
nixon said holmes was on the phone most of the time he was there 
he said he was about 20 feet away from holmes but could not hear 
holmes phone conversations because of loud background music but he 
said at one point holmes called him over and handed him the phone 
on the other end of the line was wiley fairchild 
he said im glad you talked to that fellow im satisfied 
said nixon i said thats good and handed the phone back to 
holmes 
nixon said he went back to playing records and holmes talked a 
little longer to fairchild 
nixon said he asked holmes why he placed the call and the 
prosecutor said it was because he wanted to get the damn thing 
straightened out 
the judge testified that he thought fairchilds remark about 
being satisfied was a reference to the blackmail accusation and that 
he never thought about the incident again 
he said that when questioned by federal officials and during 
grand jury proceedings about whether he had discussed drew 
fairchilds case he did not think about the phone conversation that 
night at holmes house 
he said at the time he did not consider it a discussion of 
the case and to this day does not 
the house voting unanimously for impeachment alleged 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do 
officialy or unofficially with the fairchild case and never 
influenced anyone in the case 
nixon undermined the integrity of the judiciary and 
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during 
an interview with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand 
jury testimony

the bush administration called somewhat 
mystifying tuesday a charge by the soviet foreign minister that 
the united states has been dragging its feet on nuclear arms 
negotiations 
we reject any suggestion of united states footdragging in the 
start talks or that negotiations have been put on a back burner 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
he said the united states was still awaiting a soviet reponse to 
us proposals made at the latest round of the start talks 
including new ideas on verification and stability measures start 
is an acronym for strategic arms reduction talks 
fitzwater called soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes 
criticism of the us stance on arms control somewhat mystifying 
in the sense that we have felt the negotiations were going ahead 
rather well 
shevardnadze in an interview published monday in the soviet 
government daily izvestia charged that talks in geneva on a partial 
nuclear test ban had been frozen because of the new bush 
administrations indecision 
he contrasted the constraint and timidity of the bush 
approach with progress on arms reductions made during ronald 
reagans presidency 
shevardnadze said both countries and the entire world community 
have lost a lot because of the bush administrations restrained 
indecisive position 
shevardnadze is scheduled to meet with secretary of state james 
a baker iii in wyoming on sept 2223 for discussions on nuclear 
testing and conventional arms reductions the talks could be a 
prelude to a later summit between bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
fitzwater asked if he felt the soviet minister was playing 
politics with his criticism said i wouldnt want to characterize 
his motives i dont know 
but the white house went out of its way tuesday not to antagonize 
the kremlin on another matter the visit to washington of soviet 
maverick boris yeltsin 
bush met with yeltsin for about 15 minutes and emphasized that 
the american people share his hope for the success of the reform 
movement in the soviet union the white house spokesman said 
afterwards 
bush also noted his very positive relationship with gorbachev 
and reiterated his support for perestroika fitzwater said in a 
written statement 
fitzwater said beforehand that bush only planned to drop by 
yeltsins meeting with national security adviser brent scowcroft to 
shake hands 
fitzwater said bush did not want to provide a platform for 
dissent or do anything to foster internal conflict that might be 
associated with this trip 
the meeting was closed to reporters who usually are allowed to 
observe the start of bushs meetings with visiting dignitaries

a government spokesman on tuesday stopped short of 
condemning hungarys decision to let east germans move to the west 
but indicated the exodus is illegal 
moscow sent a hardline politburo member yegor ligachev to east 
berlin the soviet government denied ligachevs trip was to discuss 
the refugee issue but it was presumed the subject would be raised 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
briefing hungary had taken an unusual and unexpected step by 
allowing the germans to go west he added the hungarian news 
agency has said that hungary is not responsible for that situation 
hungary on sunday broke with east germany a warsaw pact ally 
and announced that east germans were free to cross into the west 
thousands of east germans took advantage of the offer 
v kondratyev a reporter for soviet staterun television based 
in bonn said on the evening newscast vremya that the exodus was 
designed by west germans to destablize the gdr german 
democratic republic authorities create conditions for spitting 
socialist friendship and for german reunification 
as vremya showed east germans packing into cars kondratyev 
said the forbidden soil of the west was apparently a prime lure 
drawing east germans 
some east german citizens want to see the world to quickly 
obtain a car and home and other good things the reporter said 
some are acting on political motives 
he said some west germans are trying to attract their eastern 
neighbors by portraying east germany as a country without a 
future 
gerasimov chatting with reporters said the east germans do not 
merit being called refugees 
they dont have the status of refugees refugees are people who 
are under political or religious persecution i dont think they can 
claim that they simply want to move 
gerasimov scoffed when a reporter asked if the hungarian decision 
was a humanitarian act 
i believe there are legal ways to leave the country 
gerasimov said theres no reason to take the route via hungary 
asked if the kremlin was worried about the exodus he answered 
naturally there is some concern about this situation but he then 
added although our allies are in question here this does not 
affect us directly

transit chief richard ravitch also were on the democratic ballot

the new york city race was the liveliest there since 1977 when 
koch won his first term in office after a freeforall primary and a 
general election race against thenlt gov mario cuomo now the 
governor 
koch 64 was all but counted out as a formidable candidate a few 
months ago his popularity badly damaged by corruption scandals and 
his propensity for angering entire blocs of voters blacks and 
irishamericans most prominently with his frequently outrageous 
remarks 
early polls gave big leads to dinkins 62 whose quiet dignified 
manner contrasted sharply with that of the bombastic mayor 
but koch steadily ate away at dinkins lead in the weeks before 
the election and the race was considered a tossup by the last 
weekend of the campaign 
on monday dinkins and koch ran into each other at a high school 
dedication and agreed to a display of unity on wednesday 
regardless of which candidate won the primary 
no such display is expected in detroit where young has undergone 
vigorous attacks by challengers who ran what were dubbed abc 
campaigns anybody but coleman 
they said the 71yearold mayor has been in office too long and 
accused him of paying too much attention to downtown business 
interests at the expense of the citys poorer neighborhoods 
the two house vacancies were the outgrowth of one of the biggest 
political shakeups in congressional history the resignations of 
wright and coelho in the wake of investigations into alleged ethics 
violations 
in texas republicans saw the gerenlanier race as a rare chance 
to break into a district that has long sent democrats to congress 
but lanier 44 a pediatric allergist who is featured on the 
television program 60second housecall called his race an 
upstream swim against geren 37 geren raised nearly twice as 
much campaign money and had the advantage of wrights endorsement 
in the california race condit stressed his ties to coelho and 
berryhill conceded that there was little point in attacking the 
former congressman who remains extremely popular in his old 
district 
the major issues in the race were abortion highway congestion 
and agricultural problems 
berryhill opposed abortion except in cases involving rape incest 
and a threat to the life of the mother condit opposed abortion but 
said it was a personal decision that one needs to make for ones 
self

commerce secretary robert mosbacher wont 
concentrate on promoting a highdefinition television industry in 
the united states after being reprimanded by the white house a 
congressional source said 
mosbacher in their eyes is a renegade promoting industial 
policy and they thought it was absolutely necessary to reprimand 
him said the source who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
mosbacher was made to stand in front of the class and made to 
say i believe in the free market 500 times the source said 
as a result the commerce department will consider hdtv the next 
generation of television only as part of a broadbased effort to 
boost us technological competitiveness an administration source 
said monday 
mosbacher said for months that he was prepared to recommend that 
the bush administration loosen tax and antitrust laws to jumpstart 
private american industry efforts to compete with europe and japan 
to build hdtv which promises motionpicture clarity and compact 
discquality sound 
commerce officials first promised congress they would unveil the 
government plans for hdtv by midsummer and later by the end of the 
year 
now the administration official said the hdtv initiative is on 
hold 
there isnt necessarily going to be a single hdtv report as was 
once envisioned the official said adding that the issue would be 
viewed in a broader context 
were going to study it further and probably weave it into a 
more extensive hightech competiveness package theres no 
datecertain of when that will be ready said the official who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
its something that were working toward but its just a 
bigger animal than we thought 
the congressional source said the white house had reined in 
mosbacher for talking in terms reminiscent of the industrial 
policy program that democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis advocated in the 1988 campaign 
the wall street journal last month quoted sources who said 
mosbachers hdtv initiative was soundly criticized by other 
government agencies and was near death 
advocates of hdtv say it could revitalize a moribund us 
electronics industry and have important applications in medicine 
defense and other industries 
it is envisioned as a 20 billion industry by 2000 and would be a 
technology driver for industries such as computer chips 
the american electronics association has asked congress for more 
than a billion dollars in development money for hdtv and several 
bills are pending in congress that would provide taxpayer money to 
spur the industry 
the defense department has allotted 30 million in seed money for 
the us hdtv industry 
but a congressional budget office report last month said hdtv 
claims were very optimistic and that even under the rosiest of 
scenarios hdtv sales will be small relative to other electronic 
equipment markets 
the congressional official said nervous electronics industry 
officials are beginning to back away from hdtv 
richard wiley chairman of a broadcast industry panel that will 
advise the federal communications commission on setting a 
transmission standard for hdtv by 1992 said last week there are 
only eight applicants down from 14 who will be ready to begin 
testing next year 
he said testing will begin in january in alexandria va by the 
advanced television test center and cable labs

talks between the government and 
leftist rebels open wednesday but there appears to be little chance 
the two sides will come together to end a decade of civil war 
the talks in mexico will pit representatives of a battletempered 
guerrilla army against members of a rightwing government that 
considers them little more than murderous brigands 
the two ways of looking at these talks are very different 
said guillermo ungo leader of a leftist political coalition allied 
with the rebels 
the government views them as dialogueconcertation 
demobilization of the guerrillas and administration of democratizing 
aspirins the guerrillas see them as dialoguenegotiation true 
democratization then demobilization 
and democratization here is not a matter of aspirins it 
requires major surgery 
the rebel delegation includes two of the five members of the high 
command of the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
one of the two is joaquin villalobos considered the most senior 
member of the organization 
president alfredo cristianis delegation includes two 
cabinetlevel officials one of whom is a retired army colonel and 
the presidents chief of staff it also includes lawyers and 
academics representative of the rightwing private sector 
the rebels said monday their suspension of sabotage one of 
their most effective weapons and declaration of an 11day 
unilateral ceasefire are clear indications of determination to 
reach accords 
but they expressed doubts about the governments good faith 
we note with concern that mr cristiani and his government are 
placing obstacles in the way of the upcoming meeting by opposing the 
logical and necessary presence of international witnesses a 
moderator and national and international observers and in so doing 
are trying to establish a closed dialogue said their communique 
cristiani considers this weeks sessions preparatory he says 
they will deal with the mechanism for proceeding with talks rather 
than substantive issues the question of whether a moderator will 
take part remains to be resolved he says 
the rebels have insisted that monsignor arturo rivera damas the 
archbishop of san salvador participate as moderator the 
archibishop is on a tour of europe and the united states and will 
not take part in wednesdays meeting 
auxiliary archbishop gregorio rosa chavez is to attend the 
sessions as a witness 
the rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982 el 
salvador exhibits only a democratic veneer they say individual 
liberties are systematically violated and that public avowal of 
socialism still entails the risk of ones life 
the insurgents also contend that civilian authority remains 
subordinate to the veto and tutelage of the virulently antileftist 
armed forces 
cristiani in a press conference last week dealing with the 
upcoming dialogue said here there is no state of war the fmln 
simply operates outside the law 
the rebels on their clandestine radio ridiculed the presidents 
perception of the state of the situation 
only president cristiani in his marble tower thinks there is no 
war in our country if theres no war then what are we going to 
mexico to talk about they said

732 billion bushels up 49 percent from last years droughtplagued 
harvest of 492 billion bushels the agriculture department said 
tuesday 
but the latest estimate based on sept 1 field surveys was down 
fractionally from the 735 billion bushels indicated a month ago 
the report by departments national agricultural statistics 
service said the corn crop was in mostly good to fair condition 
last month 
at the end of august crop development was lagging behind 
normal in most of the 17 major producing states the report said 
harvest of corn for grain is well under way in the southern 
states but progress is slightly behind normal 
corn yields were estimated at 1124 bushels per acre harvested 
up from 846 bushels in 1988 but well below the record of 1194 
bushels per acre in 1987 yields were forecast in august at 1128 
bushels per acre 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is an essential ingredient for the production of meat 
poultry and dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 41 percent in 
1988 are expected to go up 5 percent to 7 percent this year 
according to usda economists 
soybean production was estimated at 189 billion bushels up 23 
percent from last years harvest of 154 billion bushels but that 
was down 1 percent from 191 billion bushels indicated last month 
yields were estimated at an average of 32 bushels per acre this 
year compared with 268 bushels in 1988 and the august forecast of 
323 bushels the record was 341 bushels per acre in 1985

acre compared with 341 bushels in 1988 and the august forecast of

the 1989 harvest at about 147 billion bushels down 6 percent from 
last year 
production of durum wheat which is planted in the spring was 
indicated at 936 million bushels up 109 percent from last years 
droughtravaged harvest and up 3 percent from the august estimate

percent from the 1988 harvest and 4 percent more than estimated in

percent from 1988 but up from the august forecast of 118 million 
bales

for major commodities analysts said total corn use in the 198990 
marketing year that began on sept 1 is still expected to be around 
75 billion bushels including domestic and export requirements 
with demand exceeding 1989 corn production that will mean 
another drawdown of us stockpiles to about 168 billion bushels 
left over by next sept 1 down from current inventories estimated 
at 186 billion bushels 
the report said corn prices may average in the range of 185 to 
225 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year down from 255 last 
season that was only a slight change from the august forecast

the tiny deer tick blamed for spreading 
lyme disease also carries another disease that has sickened at 
least five people in southeastern connecticut in the past year 
state health officials say 
the disease babesiosis is relatively rare and is caused by the 
infection of red blood cells with a parasitic protozoan a 
microscopic animal called babesia microti said matthew j cartter 
state epidemiologist in the state department of health services 
symptoms develop in about one to four weeks after exposure and 
include fever chills fatigue anorexia headache sweating muscle 
and joint pain and nausea he said 
health officials issued a warning monday as part of their effort 
to get doctors to report all cases of babesiosis 
there have been fewer than 200 confirmed cases of the disease in 
the united states in the past 10 years said eric mintz an 
epidemiologist for the federal centers for disease controls 
connecticut station 
most cases have been reported from nantucket island and marthas 
vineyard in massachusetts shelter island and fire island in new 
york block island in rhode island and wisconsin 
until 1988 only one case had been reported in a connecticut 
resident who did not acquire the disease in one of those areas 
although babesiosis is less of a risk to public health than lyme 
disease it is lifethreatening in people whose spleens do not 
function or those with other conditions that result in a suppressed 
immune system health officials said the infection is more severe 
in elderly people and in infants they said 
mintz said that unlike lyme disease babesiosis will not cause 
longterm or recurring health problems to those in good health 
lyme disease causes a rash or aches and pains and a lowgrade 
fever followed by arthritislike pain in the joints or nerve damage 
causing pain or numbness

the state department on tuesday reinforced its 
ban on sugar imports from panama and expanded the list of panamanian 
companies and individuals americans are not permitted to pay 
the actions reflected us displeasure over recent political 
developments in panama including the swearing in two weeks ago of a 
longtime associate of gen manuel antonio noriega as the countrys 
unelected president 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the moves 
were a direct result of noriegas unwillingness to respect the 
will of the panamanian people by stepping down and permitting the 
installation of a freely elected government 
as part of the economic sanctions the united states has imposed 
against panama the countrys sugar quota was suspended costing it 
15 million in revenues ms tutwiler said 
in addition to reallocating panamas 30537 metric ton quota to 
other sugar exporting nations the administration also is denying 
panama participation in a general quota increase approved by us 
special trade representative she said 
panamas share of the increase would have been 23403 tons she 
said 
ms tutwiler had no additional information on the expanded list 
of panamanian companies and individuals to which the americans cant 
make payments 
the administration has refrained from imposing sanctions on china 
on grounds that such action would hurt the chinese people asked why 
the administration doesnt apply the same rationale to panama ms 
tutwiler said noriega is hurting the panamanian people more than the 
sanctions by refusing to step down 
other officials asking not to be identified said the 
administration is reluctant to take stronger measures against panama 
because they could inflict further damage to the countrys already 
weak economy without necessarily ensuring noriegas departure 
noriega has been indicted by two florida grand juries on drug 
smuggling charges 
most of the sanctions against panama were imposed 18 months ago 
after noriega forced out a president who had demanded he step down 
as commander of the countrys military forces 
the us also has frozen panamanian assets in the united states 
worth about 300 million

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said in his annual report on the state of the world tuesday that 
there is a new international atmosphere of cooperation but that 
grave problems remain in the middle east 
perez de cuellar also recommended that foreign ministers of the 
15member security council meet periodically to consider 
international peace and security in different regions to avert 
conflicts and defuse explosive situations the idea is not new but 
the secretarygeneral placed special emphasis on prevention of armed 
conflicts as well as peacekeeping operations to control them 
the un chief in a 28page survey of international problems and 
progress said the past year has brought little relief from 
frequent sometimes massive violations of human rights worldwide 
but the world he said is witnessing the end of the era of 
sterile confrontations between east and west in the past year he 
said the assistance of the united nations was sought as never 
before 
a major un accomplishment was implementation of an independence 
plan for namibia formerly southwest africa from south africa he 
said 
despite un successes in other areas the situation in the 
middle east remains a source of grave concern perez de cuellar said 
hopes for early progress because of the palestinian national 
councils conciliatory statements toward israel have sadly given 
way to mistrust and doubt among the parties concerned he said 
efforts to pave the way to negotiations have proved frustratingly 
inconclusive 
he said the situation in the israelioccupied territories has 
worsened steadily since the palestinian uprising began nearly two 
years ago and that lebanons government and society also are 
disintegrating because of escalating violence between christians and 
moslems there 
concerning the divided island of cyprus the secretarygeneral 
said we have now reached the critical juncture where an overall 
settlement that will safeguard the legitimate interests and meet the 
concerns of both communities seems possible 
he has been meeting with leaders of the greek cypriot and turkish 
cypriot communities 
perez de cuellar said one place where un involvement had not 
solved a problem was in afghanistan where moslem rebels are 
fighting a sovietbacked government 
efforts to end the fighting have failed and un humanitarian 
assistance to afghanistan has been severely impeded because of a 
massive infusion of military aid from the united states pakistan 
and the soviet union to the warring parties he said 
in addition despite a yearold unsupervised ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war both sides remain far apart and a un peace plan has 
not been implemented the secretarygeneral reported 
although the united nations is at the forefront of international 
efforts in peacekeeping and other areas the secretarygeneral said 
the organization is short of funds and greater demands are being 
made for more un operations 
the present financial position is not reassuring he said 
as of aug 31 outstanding contributions to the regular budget 
exceeded 688 million including 347 million for the current year 
the un chief reported for peacekeeping operations the arrears 
were 661 million

communist east germany on tuesday issued a sharp 
formal protest to warsaw pact ally hungary for permitting thousands 
of east germans to go to the west and demanded the flood be stopped 
the state adn news agency also said soviet politburo hardliner 
yegor ligachev and east german government officials had issued a 
joint statement harshly criticizing west germany 
the developments came amid indications east berlin had begun 
clamping down on trips to hungary 
the german democratic republic east germany expects the 
immediate rescinding of hungarys decision to unilaterally 
suspend parts of bilateral agreements on border controls said a 
lengthy report by adn 
the hungarian side is responsible for the current situation 
said the report 
according to adn the protest note was handed over to the 
hungarian foreign ministry in budapest 
more than 10000 east germans who were vacationing in hungary 
have fled to the west since early monday 
east german newspapers devoted large amounts of space to the 
exodus and portrayed it as an unjustified act caused by west germany 
with the assistance of hungary 
neues deutschland the communist partys official newspaper ran 
a report from a refugee camp at passau west germany it called the 
exodus a provocation organized at high levels and an illegal 
action to lure away east german citizens in hungary 
the communist party youth newspaper junge welt called the exodus 
an antisocialist action by bonn 
sources told the associated press that police offices responsible 
for processing applications for tourist visas are filled nearly 
every day with east germans eager to go to hungary ostensibly for 
vacation but many more are seeing those requests turned down they 
said 
no official figures are available on the number of east germans 
waiting for a judgment on their visa applications 
some unofficial estimates put the number of east germans who 
desire to emigrate to the west at 1 million 
news of the exodus of east germans to the west provoked bitter 
cynicism among some who remained in their communist homeland 
the officials are soon going to introduce a new holiday just 
for us who stayed the day of those left behind said an east 
berlin construction worker who would not give his name 
the east germans arriving in the west say they left their 
homeland because of repression and frustration over the governments 
refusal to adopt political reforms 
a new opposition political group has been founded in east germany 
to try to pressure the communist government to make democratic 
reforms 
according to lutheran church sources the new forum was 
founded by 100 east germans including former communist party 
members scientists workers and students from across the country 
in an announcement of its founding the group said it is tired of 
a country filled with henchmen informers and donothing 
loudmouths 
some communist party functionaries have complained they feel like 
their country is like a ship without a captain with east german 
leader erich honecker slowly recovering from gall bladder surgery 
western news reports have said honecker may be dying but 
government sources deny that

federal agents who hauled in 2700 pounds of 
cocaine 17 defendants and five boats described the bust tuesday as 
a textbook case of how us agencies can choke off the cocaine 
pipeline from colombia 
the seizure of the freighter nerma allegedly used as a smuggling 
mother ship as well as three speedboats and a trawler used to 
haul the cocaine to land was described by agents as the largest 
since president bush announced his battle plan against drug 
trafficking 
videotape provided by the coast guard showed a chase in which the 
speedboats tried to evade a persistent but slower coast guard 
craft which fired 43 warning shots near the speedboats a fourth 
speedboat escaped 
the drug organization supervising the cocaine smuggling was based 
in miami and had been under investigation for several months said 
drug enforcement administration agent tom cash more arrests were 
expected 
federal agents moved in early sunday while cocaine was being 
unloaded from the nerma in bahamian water the document said 
the cocaine was believed to have originated in medellin 
colombia home of the enormous medellin cartel of cocaine 
traffickers and was loaded onto the freighter on the island of 
aruba off the northern coast of venezuela 
the cocaine had left colombia before the aug 18 assassination of 
colombian presidential candidate luis carlos galan set off a new 
crackdown in colombia and was already in the pipeline to the 
united states the dea estimated 
cash said the bust is indicative of the magnitude of the 
pipeline 
this is a textbook case of what taxpayers get for their money 
in drug enforcement he said 
the dea coast guard customs and local police were involved 
officials said 
a coast guard cutter had been sent to intercept the nerma 
registered in the south pacific island nation of vanuatu after the 
ship was detected on radar saturday officials said 
coast guardsmen boarded the nerma early the next day after seeing 
bales of cocaine each weighing about 70 pounds floating alongside 
court documents said each bale consisted of plastic packages 
bundled around flotation devices 
seven danish crew members aboard the freighter were arrested and 
ordered held without bond monday 
six more men were arrested aboard the three speedboats and four 
were arrested late monday in miami in the vicinity of the trawler 
which apparently picked up a load from the nerma before the coast 
guard reached the freighter and had sailed into the miami river 
the defendants face federal charges of possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute 
authorities seized 1100 pounds of cocaine bobbing near the 
freighter nerma an additional 70 pounds was seized inside the 
freighter and 1540 pounds was seized aboard the trawler the jj 
lorick dea spokesman john fernandes said tuesday

abortion will prove an important and perhaps 
decisive issue in the two governors elections this fall in virginia 
and new jersey democratic consultants and analysts said tuesday 
but the analysts in a discussion of abortion politics sponsored 
by a liberal think tank differed on whether democratic candidates 
are smart to promote positions in favor of abortion rights in other 
races around the country 
democratic candidates for governor in both states holding 
gubernatorial elections this year have staked out positions 
generally in favor of abortion rights 
a consultant to the virginia democratic candidate lt gov l 
douglas wilder suggested wilder plans to use the issue in 
television advertising in his race he faces republican nominee j 
marshall coleman who has softened his opposition to abortion but 
remains perceived as the antiabortion candidate the analysts said 
frank greer a washingtonbased media consultant to the wilder 
campaign said until this year we always said this is an issue 
you dont want to pay to put on tv 
this year people are going to be paying and i think that 
will make it a cutting issue greer said everyone will face the 
question of deciding its an important issue in how you vote and it 
will be a determining issue i think in the virginia race in terms 
of how people vote 
greer commented at a luncheon sponsored by the center for 
national policy 
celinda lake a democratic pollster described both virginia and 
new jersey as prochoice states she said that there and 
elsewhere the supreme courts recent decision permitting states 
more leeway in regulating abortion has presented a political 
opportunity for democratic candidates supporting abortion rights 
in new jersey rep james florio a democrat faces republican 
rep james courter 
lake said polls show that about 20 percent of voters are 
influenced by the abortion issue and that democrats can be aided by 
a feeling among many moderate voters that we shouldnt go back 
to a time when abortions were illegal 
but charles cook editor of the cook political report newsletter 
and a political analyst said much of the polling showing voters in 
favor of abortion are meaningless because voters will decide their 
votes on other issues 
he said it was very very dangerous for the democratic party 
to allow itself to become identified as the proabortion party and 
that candidates who push proabortion positions risk alienating 
older democratic voters less educated voters and in many states 
black voters 
where the american people are now is theyre mildly 
prochoice cook said 
any candidate that decides to go full out on abortion one way 
or the other runs a very real risk of damaging their party base 
cook said you risk offending your whole partisan base id be 
very leery before i crawled out on that limb

the bush administration plans to propose to 
congress that the united states next year accept 50000 soviet 
refugees plus 6500 more from eastern europe a us official and 
sources in the american jewish community said tuesday 
worldwide 125000 refugees would be admitted an increase of 
slightly less than 8 percent from this year 
the 50000 soviet refugees at least half of whom are expected to 
be jews are a fraction of the 250000 soviet citizens the state 
department estimated last week would apply for entry to the united 
states in 1990 
of the 50000 the sources said 40000 would have their 
transportation and settlement costs paid by the united states the 
10000 others would have to depend on private organizations friends 
and relatives 
this years combined quota for refugees from the soviet union and 
eastern europe is 50000 the new plan would allocate 50000 slots 
to the soviet union and set up a separate category of 6500 for 
eastern europe 
last year as emigration from the soviet union began to climb 
the combined quota for the soviet union and eastern europe was 
15000 
jewel s lafontant the state departments refugee affairs 
coordinator is scheduled to testify to a house judiciary 
subcommittee wednesday about the administration proposal 
an estimated 40000 soviet jews are expected to leave the soviet 
union this year currently there is a backlog of an estimated 30000 
to 40000 jews with exit permits for israel who have not left the 
soviet union or are in vienna and rome seeking entry to the united 
states 
most soviet jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in 
israel all but a fraction however then apply for admission to the 
united states once they have left their country 
according to the jewish sources who demanded anonymity the bush 
administration will also drastically revise its processing 
procedures tentatively refugees who apply before oct 1 the 
beginning of the 1990 fiscal year will be processed in rome and 
vienna 
thereafter applications will be handled by a beefedup us 
embassy staff in moscow and by a new office to be set up outside 
washington 
the us official who also asked not to be named said that the 
oct 1 cutoff date was very likely but that it might be set back a 
few months 
while the soviets seeking admission remain in their country 
their applications would be considered both in moscow and in the 
washington area office 
israel has expressed concern that jewish refugees from the soviet 
union were increasingly choosing to head for the united states once 
out of their homeland depriving the jewish state of needed settlers 
it was not clear whether the change in us procedure would 
increase the flow of refugees to israel 
the rising exodus from the soviet union which results from us 
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by president mikhail s 
gorbachev poses administrative and financial problems for the bush 
administration 
eager to reinforce the right of soviet citizens to travel freely 
us officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open 
but beyond the 50000 slots allotted for the soviet union 
prospective jewish emigres will be encouraged to apply for parole 
status this requires private support for the immigrants 
also the sources said in admitting 50000 refugees from the 
soviet union preference will be given to those with close relatives 
here but no applicant will be declared ineligble on the grounds he 
has no relative here the officials said 
rep bruce morrison dconn who heads the house subcommittee on 
immigration said as hearings opened that the administrations 
proposal provides financing for 84000 of the 125000 refugees 
overall 
where do we get the money for the rest he asked a panel of 
private witnesses 
morrison also expressed concern about the backlog of emigres in 
rome and vienna awaiting us decisions on their eligibility to 
enter the united states he said the administration had wasted money 
through this processing method and changes would have to be 
considered

two lawmakers on tuesday introduced a bill 
that would allow judges to send adults to prison when children 
injure or kill someone with a firearm that was not safely stored 
we require childproof caps on aspirin bottles yet we allow 
loaded guns to be left in the kids playroom said rep david 
clarenbach this bill is a small step toward sanity and a giant 
leap for safety 
the measure would set maximum penalties of two years in prison 
and 10000 fines for adults who leave loaded guns or weapons 
accessible to children under 16 resulting in an injury or death 
the bill endorsed by the wisconsin arm of the national rifle 
association and handgun control inc was touted as an effort to 
reduce childhood injuries through education 
this is not a gun control bill its a gun safety bill 
clarenbach said 
he and sen john plewa said the measure was in response to a 
number of accidental shootings involving children this summer in 
madison and milwaukee 
ir would require the department of natural resources to expand 
its hunter safety program to promote gun safety public awareness 
and safe use and storage of weapons the bill also would require gun 
retailers to post information about the penalties for failing to 
secure loaded firearms

crews finished burying an enormous pile of 
burning tires under a layer of soil tuesday after two days of work 
but the nowunderground fire was expected to smolder for some time 
state fire marshal william toland said the cause of the fire 
appeared suspicious 
about 35 people living within a halfmile of the dump who were 
evacuated from their homes and took shelter sunday night at a church 
were home tuesday several roads in the area were reopened 
meanwhile the fire means the state and a new york firm may have 
to renegotiate a 11 million contract to get rid of the tires a 
state official said 
the abandoned dump caught fire sunday the second time since 
1984 sending flames 40 feet into the air and releasing billowing 
smoke that could be seen 25 miles away for the next two days 
david tordoff of the federal environmental protection agency said 
epa scientists monitored the air soil and ground water for harmful 
chemicals stemming from the fire that is expected to smolder for 
some time the 1984 fire at the dump hung on for several weeks 
tordoff estimated that about 2 acres of tires stacked 30 to 40 
feet high was on fire the dump holds an estimated 15 millions 
covering about seven acres he said his agency earmarked up to 1 
million from the hazardous waste superfund for the effort 
about 250 firefighters from 45 communities in three states worked 
to contain the fire using 65 trucks and 10 loaders to haul tons of 
dirt onto the fire which burned so hotly that even 2500 gallons of 
water a minute just vaporized 
in july the state contracted with integrated waste systems inc 
of buffalo ny to shred the tires at the dump for shipment to 
greece to fuel a cement plant the removal was to begin shortly 
william evans of the department of environmental services waste 
management division said the fires effects would need to be 
assessed and the contract possibly renegotiated 
charles laubisch a vice president of the company walked the 
site monday with evans laubisch while not commenting on possible 
renegotiations said equipment for the cleanup is already in town

president bush in a televised appeal to 
millions of schoolchildren said tuesday that refusing drugs wont 
make you a nerd and urged youngsters to help others stay away from 
narcotics 
im asking you to not to look the other way bush said in an 
address beamed live from the white house to thousands of schools 
across the country 
saying everyone knows someone who has a problem bush added 
im asking you to find someone who needs you and offer to help 
ill say it again if youre not in trouble help someone who is 
on another front as bush made his speech the white house 
uncorked a toughly worded partisan attack against congressional 
democrats who are criticizing the administrations antidrug efforts 
as inadequate and underfunded 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said democrats were 
trying to play pricetag politics with the administrations 
plan which calls for more prisons more prosecutors tougher 
sentences and aid to latin american nations to help combat drug 
cartels 
their first answer was to tax more fitzwater said of the 
democrats then they had a daylong conference to decide why they 
cant win a presidential election and now their new answer is to 
spend more 
on capitol hill sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the 
senate appropriations committee proposed legislation to boost 
antidrug spending to 101 billion or 22 billion more than 
bushs program in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
byrd proposed acrosstheboard cuts in many domestic and pentagon 
programs of 0575 percent bush had suggested taking money away from 
a handful of domestic programs to pay for his program 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan indicated that despite 
the white house opposition he liked elements of byrds plan he 
may have the best solution on the funding side of the equation 
dole said of byrds proposal im not certain of the amount but 
perhaps thats something we can work out 
white house spokesman fitzwater said byrds proposal throws 
money at the problem rather than providing a plan the white house 
said bushs advisers would recommend he veto the democratic version 
while the white house argued with democrats the administration 
offered a new price tag for the longterm cost of the drug war 
william j bennett the national drug control policy director 
told the house foreign affairs committee i dont think its 
unreasonable to say that we are talking about a 50 billion program 
over five years 
at the white house bush spoke for 15 minutes to schoolchildren 
in an address carried live by the four major television networks as 
well as educational cable systems 
the education department had alerted 15000 superintendents and 
55000 principals of the broadcast and some schools arranged to 
hold assemblies where students could watch the speech and discuss 
the drug problem 
presidents dont often get the chance to talk directly to 
students so today for each of you sitting in a classroom or 
assembly hall this message goes straight to you bush said 
speaking from the presidential library 
most of you are doing the right thing he said but for 
those of you who let drugs make their decisions for them you can 
almost hear the doors slamming shut 
calling drugs an equal opportunity destroyer bush said 
they have no conscience they dont care where the money comes 
from they just murder people young and old good and bad innocent 
and guilty it doesnt matter for too many drugs mean death 
he said ill let you in on a secret we all can succeed if 
you dont use drugs you can be anything you want to be so 
dont blow it 
the president said that saying no wont make you a nerd it 
wont make you a loser in fact it will make you more friends than 
drugs ever will 
first reactions from pupils in classrooms at least publicly to 
reporters were skeptical 
its not going to make no difference people dont listen 
said 11yearold louranda ross after listening to bushs address 
along with her fifthgrade classmates at mattahunt elementary school 
in innercity boston 
in washington 13yearold russell davis blurted out in a 
questionandanswer session after his class heard bush tell kids to 
help other kids sometimes you cant help them if they dont want 
help 
if a person is using drugs and he feels he must have it when 
you offer help he might rebel against you what can you do 
russell asked raising his hands in exasperation 
dont give up said health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan who had come to hines junior high school in the southeast 
section of the nations capital to reinforce the presidents message 
equating drugs with death bush displayed the badge of a slain 
22yearold rookie policeman and said i keep this badge in a 
drawer in my desk to remind me of that 
the badge belonged to new york city police officer eddie byrne 
who was killed in 1988 while protecting a witness in a drug case it 
was presented to bush during a campaign appearance in new york last 
year by byrnes father 
bush combined his appeal to stay off drugs with a warning of 
punishment for those who use narcotics 
some think there wont be room for them in jail well make 
room were doubling prison space 
some think there arent enough prosecutors well hire them 
with the largest increase in federal prosecutors in history the day 
of the dealer is drawing to a close the president said

a jury was seated tuesday in the 
murder trial of a former nurses aide charged with smothering five 
nursing home patients with her lesbian lover 
although defense attorney james piazza had sought to move the 
trial out of the county due to pretrial publicity a jury was seated 
in less than two days opening arguments are to begin wednesday 
gwendolyn graham 25 is charged with five counts of firstdegree 
murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of 
female patients at alpine manor nursing home in suburban walker 
the key witness for the prosecution will be grahams alleged 
accomplice and former livein companion catherine wood of grand 
rapids 
wood also was charged with two counts of firstdegree murder but 
prosecutors allowed her to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder in exchange for her testimony against 
graham firstdegree murder carries a mandatory life sentence 
without parole while wood has a chance of parole in 10 years on the 
lesser charges 
at grahams preliminary examination wood described how graham 
of tyler texas chose frail patients who would not be able to 
struggle and therefore would leave no signs of suffocation 
wood testified that graham told her killing the patients helped 
her relieve tension 
piazza has called wood a pathological liar 
when the five patients died in 1987 their deaths were listed as 
natural and no autopsies were performed police only began 
investigating late last year after woods former husband told them 
his former wife confessed to her part in the slayings

environmental abuse appears to be 
heating the earth damaging lungs poisoning lakes defacing 
monuments and shrinking the food supply scientists warned tuesday 
at a conference of chemists 
six of the warmest years in the last 100 occurred in the 
80s said stephen schneider deputy director of the national 
center for atmospheric research and ill give you odds that the 
90s will be warmer than the 80s 
doomsday scenarios of global warming acid rain and ozone 
depletion once only the province of radical environmentalists 
topped the agenda at the american chemical society convention 
the amount of carbon dioxide the largest component of the 
greenhouse effect has increased by 25 percent in the atmosphere 
since the industrial revolution began and 10 percent since 1950 
methane another heattrapping gas has doubled 
the warmth will generate more killer hurricanes change farming 
areas to deserts and raise sea levels high enough to cause major 
flooding and salinization of coastal water supplies and farm lands 
schneider said 
a worstcase scenario would raise the temperature over the next 
100 years by up to 10 degrees farenheit or more than the difference 
between the ice ages and warmer intervals and that took 10000 
years to change 
we probably entered global warming two decades ago but it 
will take another two decades or so to be sure he said the 
problem is the experiment is in a laboratory called the earth 
prompted by growing environmental concerns the chemical society 
which represents more than 137000 chemists nationwide and has met 
annually for 198 years scheduled three days of special sessions 
this week on atmospheric chemistry and the environment and received 
scores of related papers 
a texas aampm researcher found that increased ultraviolet light 
an effect of the thinning ozone layer seems to kill phytoplankton 
in the antarctic the tiny plants which sayed elsayed calls the 
grass of the sea are the basis for the entire marine food chain 
a paper from the university of copenhagen said human beings may 
already be feeling increased acidic air pollution in their lungs 
including chronic bronchitis among those already suffering from 
asthma 
william wilson of the atmospheric research and exposure 
assessment laboratory showed that air pollution is becoming a major 
issue in art and monument conservation around the world a paper by 
david pimentel of cornell traced the increasing insectcaused losses 
of corn and other crops despite a 1000fold increase in the use of 
polluting pesticides and suggested other forms of managing farm 
yield 
canadian government pollution expert hans martin painted a gloomy 
picture of acid rain in his country saying half of the nations 
720000 lakes were affected by the fallout from sulfur and nitrogen 
compound pollution 
martin showed pictures of accelerating forest damage over the 
past decade from canada to czechoslovakia saying little is 
understood about the phenomenon but it is clearly worsening 
the death of the trees may be caused by pollution mobilizing 
aluminum in the soil and aluminum martin notes is also blamed 
for contributing to alzheimers disease in humans 
our society has messed up for 10 to 20 years and will mess up 
for 10 more years he warned 
but one of the most important changes has already occurred most 
of the speakers agreed martin said environmental concerns are 
already listed by canadians as their biggest concern 
schneider said that since the long hot summer of 1988 the 
interest in global warming has increased astronomically

the house on tuesday overwhelmingly approved a 
bill designed to overcome an unpopular supreme court decision and 
restore criminal penalties for flag burning 
the democraticsponsored bill was passed 380 to 38 and sent to 
the senate which plans action next month 
the lopsided tally came after speaker thomas s foley promised a 
vote later on a constitutional amendment the remedy demanded by 
president bush and many congressional republicans to undo the 
courts ruling that flag burning could be a protected form of free 
speech 
i remain opposed and i think the leadership is opposed to a 
constitutional amendment said foley dwash calling such action 
unnecessary tampering with the bill of rights 
however he said he had assured those seeking an amendment they 
would get their vote and he denied that that marked a political 
setback he suggested he would work to keep the amendment from 
getting the twothirds vote needed for passage 
some seeking an amendment softened their opposition to the 
statute once assured that the democratic leadership would not use 
it to block their alternative 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house veterans 
committee and cosponsor of bushs amendment stood up in the house 
and announced he would vote for the statute 
i still have doubts that we can do the job by statute but this 
is a step in the right direction he said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we believe 
that this bill is insufficient to provide the protections that we 
seek and therefore continue to press for a constitutional 
amendment 
but he stopped short of any veto threat thus heling the house 
democrats garner support for the statute 
conservative republicans however continued to accuse the 
democrats of trying to sidetrack the constitutional amendment while 
pushing a statute the gop lawmakers contend may still be 
unconstitutional 
the game is obvious said rep chuck douglas rnh this 
is the flag burner protection act of 1989 
the statute a version of which is expected to come before the 
senate in early october includes criminal penalties of up to a year 
in jail plus an unspecified fine for flag burning or other 
mutilation 
senate majority leader george mitchell has promised a vote on the 
constitutional amendment later next month and foley said tuesday 
that house action would follow the senates 
both the statute and the constitutional amendment are attempts to 
address a supreme court ruling in june that threw out the conviction 
of a man who burned a flag at the 1984 republican national 
convention in dallas 
the court held that the law was unconstitutional because it was 
aimed at suppressing the mans right to political expression as 
guaranteed by the constitution 
bush who visited a flag factory as part of his campaign last 
year joined republican leaders on capitol hill in a drive for a 
constitutional amendment to give the federal government and the 
states specific power to protect the flag from desecration 
foley and other key democrats however argue that such an 
amendment would dangerously create a loophole in the bill of rights 
and a regular statute could meet the high courts concerns 
we offer a carefully drawn constitutionally sound statute a 
law that will protect the flag with no threat to our precious right 
of free speech said rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the 
house judiciary committees subcommittee on constitutional law 
edwards said the statute could pass muster with the court because 
it does not make expression illegal just the actual physical abuse 
of the flag 
but rep f james sensenbrenner rwis senior republican on 
edwards subcommittee said that approach gutted the purpose of the 
statute 
why are we so reluctant to amend the constitution to demand 
that flag desecration be prohibited he said is it too much to 
ask those who consider themselves americans to be required to have 
respect for our flag 
the house bill includes a provision for expedited review of the 
law by the supreme court if its constitutionality is challenged and 
an exception so that veterans groups could continue their practice 
of disposal of old wornout flags by burning them 
opponents of the statute said the disposal exception was a 
loophole that could protect unsavory flag burners that they could 
dirty their flags before burning them the bills drafters however 
said the dirtying itself would be illegal

prime minister margaret thatcher 
praised a locally recruited army unit tuesday and sidestepped 
questions about murder charges lodged a day earlier against two of 
its members 
mrs thatcher expressed confidence in the 6500member ulster 
defense regiment which she said had suffered greatly in the 
irish republican army uprising against british rule 
i have just been looking at the figures 179 udr members 
have been murdered in the last 20 years they are a very very brave 
group of men said the prime minister during a visit to northern 
ireland 
on monday two members of the mainly protestant regiment and a 
taxi driver were accused in court of killing a roman catholic 
loughlin maginn 38 
maginn allegedly was targeted after security documents 
identifying him as an ira suspect were leaked to an outlawed 
protestant group the ulster freedom fighters 
one of the two soldiers was also charged in the slaying of 
another catholic liam mckee 36 
during a full day of talks with businessmen soldiers and police 
mrs thatcher met an eightman defense regiment patrol at the 
lissanelly army barracks in omagh in the center of the province 
a member of the regiment who spoke to mrs thatcher said she did 
not mention the allegations of leaked documents which authorities 
are investigating 
the soldier who was not allowed to be identified told 
reporters she assured us she was being supportive we talked 
about personal security nothing was mentioned about intelligence 
files nothing dramatic was said 
mrs thatcher told reporters that claims of collusion between 
some soldiers and extremists were matters for the courts 
as for the murder charges she told reporters it is not a 
matter for me if a person is charged they are not guilty until 
they are found guilty by the courts 
as is usual with visits by british leaders to the province 
nothing was announced about mrs thatchers trip until after she 
arrived at a royal air force base near belfast 
roadblocks were set up wherever she went and police 
sharpshooters were on rooftops 
the security measures have been set up to prevent attacks by the 
mainly catholic ira which is fighting to unite the 
protestantdominated province with the catholic majority irish 
republic

the pentagon said tuesday the united states is 
prepared to expand the training role of us troops sent to 
assist the andean drug battle but insisted those forces will not 
take part in any local antidrug operations 
giving the latest update on the us effort to battle the 
international drug war pentagon spokesman pete williams also 
defended the defense department against criticism from the chief of 
colombias national police force who complained the pentagon is 
sending the wrong equipment for the fight 
theres a great deal more to go said williams noting that 
some 104 million in equipment has been sent to columbia as part of 
president bushs emergency 65 million aid package to that nation 
williams said there are less than 50 us military officers 
in colombia peru and bolivia but he refused to specify where their 
locations 
controversy arose about the role of us troops in the 
presidents new strategy following a published report that bush had 
signed a secret directive authorizing us special forces to 
accompany local forces on some patrols 
asked to clarify the role of us advisers in the current 
situation williams stressed as bush and white house officials 
have done as well that the troops are not there to enter combat 
but to provide training equipment and support for the local police 
and military in the antinarcotics fight 
the critical point to bear in mind no us forces no us 
military personnel will accompany host government forces on actual 
field operations williams said but we are prepared to expand 
the training role its clearly an expansion of our training 
role 
although williams refused to discuss the details of bushs secret 
directive he said us forces now will be allowed to go beyond 
the boundaries of secured garrison training areas in their 
training missions 
he was also asled about published comments by colombias maj 
gen gomez padilla that the us equipment being sent to that nation 
was more suitable for conventional warfare than operations against 
narcotic traffickers 
this is not something where you fill out your eastern 
mountains sports catalog and mail it in its not that simple 
williams said 
he said the items sent to colombia have been derived as the 
result of continuing discussions between the united states and the 
colombians its their request and we match it with what we can 
provide 
the spokesman noted that under the emergency program the 
pentagon must send materiel gleaned from existing stocks and cannot 
purchase new items 
so far he said that aid has included 15 aircraft 23 jeeps and 
ambulances medical supplies bulletproof vests radios machine 
guns and grenade launchers 
the colombian police have recieved 5 uh1 huey helicopters 
small arms machine guns grenade launchers and ammunition the 
colombian army has been sent vehicles radios medical equipment 
grenade launchers and ammunition while the air force has been sent 
two c130 transport planes and spare parts eight oa37 
reconnaisance jets and spare parts he said 
the judiciary has been provided 500 bulletproof vests williams 
said 
we are undergoing extensive and continuing negotiations with 
the government of colombia both civil and military officials to 
develop the maximum amount of benefit of our available military 
equipment williams said it may not be a perfect match but the 
equipment and its schedule has received a great deal of attention at 
the pentagon 
the spokesman said that the pentagon believes that the aid that 
we have offered is appropriate to the circumstance

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter agreed 
tuesday to consider boosting disaster payments to farmers who 
harvested a second crop after severe weather destroyed their winter 
wheat and cotton 
farm state lawmakers contend the agriculture departments formula 
for calculating relief payments is inflexible and unfair to farmers 
who planted a replacement crop after drought hail and extreme cold 
battered the great plains earlier this year 
under the current formula some farmers who did nothing after 
the drought are better off than those who planted a second crop 
said sen phil gramm rtexas 
you cant treat the guys who are trying to help themselves 
worse than the guys who are waiting around for the government to 
help them gramm said 
gramm and senate minority leader bob dole of kansas predicted 
usda would modify its second crop formula under which 75 percent of 
the gross value of a second crop would be deducted when calculating 
disaster payments for losses on the first crop 
thats tantamount to saying the cost of production was 25 
percent said cotton fanning executive assistant at the high 
plains cotton growers inc in lubbock texas 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he was encouraged by yeutters 
response to lawmakers concerns during a meeting tuesday in doles 
office 
the secretary recognized that changes are needed although he 
stopped short of a firm commitment bentsen said after the session 
gramm who also attended the meeting said the usdas forumula is 
totally arbitrary and that farmers costs vary he said he asked 
yeutter to come up with a practical way of calculating the real 
costs 
bentsen has proposed that only the net value of the second crop 
be deducted 
yeutter spokeswoman kelly shipp said the secretary would respond 
after evaluating the suggestions

the house on tuesday approved a compromise 
186 billion spending bill that includes money to break ground on a 
5 billion superconducting super collider physics research center in 
texas 
the energy and water projects appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 
also includes 636 million four times the amount allocated for 
this year for environmental cleanups at the nations nuclear 
weapons plants 
the compromise between earlier house and senate versions of the 
bill was approved by the house 39227 senate action sending the 
measure to the presidents desk was expected later in the week 
the super collider a 53mile underground loop to be constructed 
25 miles south of dallas would get 225 million under the 
compromise 
president bush had asked for 250 million for the project in his 
adopted home state the house had cut the request to 200 million 
after critics called the science project an expensive toy 
the collider would be the most powerful and advanced facility in 
the world for examining subatomic particles physicists hope to use 
the machine to duplicate on an infinitesimally small scale the 
conditions of the postulated big bang moment of creation of the 
universe and thus answer the most basic question what is matter 
the super collider is just one of many projects in the bill dear 
to lawmakers seeking federal spending in their home states 
construction would begin on some three dozen new flood control 
and navigation projects more than three times what the white house 
requested however the bill cuts total spending on water projects 
by 2 percent from the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
the 636 million for nuclear production plant cleanups is part 
of 97 billion provided for the energy departments atomic weapons 
program total cost of cleaning up the dangerous radioactive waste 
from the plants dating back to the manhattan project of world war 
ii could run as high as 100 billion 
the bill also provides 22 billion for energy research and 
development and 121 million for the tennessee valley authority

high school sports stars being recruited by 
college coaches may soon be signing a piece of paper showing they 
know the percentage of athletes who graduate from the school before 
they sign a scholarship 
under strong pressure from sen bill bradley the head of the 
national collegiate athletic association promised to back a federal 
law requiring such disclosure unless the ncaa acts on its own next 
january 
if we dont pass meaningful legislation i will personally 
lobby for this bill ncaa executive director dick schultz told 
bradley 
similarly ithaca college president james whalen testifying on 
behalf of the american council on education pleaded with a senate 
committee to delay passing a law until college administrators have 
more time to implement a disclosure plan of their own 
if the school chiefs fail to act whalen promised to join schultz 
in backing legislation 
however bradley a new jersey democrat and rhodes scholar who 
starred in basketball at princeton university and for the new york 
knicks before taking up politics said he viewed such assertions of 
good intention as too little too late and said he would not 
wait for the ncaa 
bradley told reporters he hopes to win passage of the legislation 
before the ncaa meets in january 
legislation would be better he said because there are nearly 
500 us colleges that are not members of the ncaa he also said 
having the consumer disclosure requirement contained in an act 
of congress would temper the temptation for college coaches to cheat 
in pursuit of a better wonloss record 
bradley said he was astounded there was any opposition to the 
bill at all because i really thought i was introducing something 
that was apple pie and motherhood 
among those testifying in favor of the bradley bill monday were 
oscar robertson a former nba player and member of the national 
basketball hall of fame villanova university basketball coach 
rollie massimino bob hurley coach of the topranked st anthonys 
high school basketball team in jersey city nj richard lapchick 
director of northeastern universitys center for the study of sport 
in society and dr patricia lucas principal of southeast high 
school in bradenton fla testifying on behalf of the national 
association of secondary school principals 
schultz said the 48 percent graduate rate for college athletes at 
ncaa member institutions is actually a fraction of a point better 
than the rate for student bodies as a whole 
schultz who has headed the ncaa for two years also argued that 
rules put into place over the past five years to strenghten academic 
achievement by athletes have not had time to show up in statistics 
the ncaa collects graduation data from its member institutions 
and issues it in an annual report however the report is not broken 
down by individual college 
the bradley bill would require that the individual figures be 
reported publicly to the us department of education broken down 
by sport and that each institution also disclose its own rates to 
prospective athletic recruits and that the figures be printed on any 
scholarship papers signed by the student 
moreover the legislation would require the student to 
acknowledge in writing that he or she has discussed the graduation 
statistics with a high school guidance counselor or principal 
lapchick said it was particularly important that disclosure be by 
sport rather than confined to an overall rate for all the school 
athletes because the worst problems are in the big revenue sports 
football and basketball 
it doesnt do an inner city kid much good to know how white 
male soccer players are doing or which female field hockey players 
are graduating he said

in a highly unusual move the 
government tuesday said it would allow a mass march condemning 
alleged brutality by police riot squads protest marches in south 
africa normally are outlawed 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu and other organizers of 
wednesdays demonstration had refused to seek authorization from the 
government but acting president fw de klerk told reporters the 
protest would be allowed nonetheless because of assurances that it 
would be peaceful 
i hope tomorrow will prove that a new spirit can arise in our 
beautiful country a spirit in which all christians and all people 
who say that they believe in peace will reach out and really start 
talking to each other de klerk said 
the march through downtown cape town is to coincide with the 
opening of parliament where the national partycontrolled electoral 
college is expected to elect de klerk to a fiveyear term thursday 
he has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would give some 
form of political rights to the nowvoteless black majority 
tutu and other activists allege that at least 23 people in cape 
towns black and mixedrace townships were killed on the night of 
the sept 6 parliamentary elections by police police say 15 people 
were killed 10 in blackonblack faction fighting 
de klerk said police were forced to act because militants were 
forcefully preventing people from voting he said remedial steps 
would be taken on any policemen found to have used excessive force 
this is not the time to aggravate the differences that exist in 
our society said de klerk this is the time for finding common 
ground 
one government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
indicated the decision to allow the march came after an appeal from 
officials of the white dutch reformed church who contacted the 
government after meeting tutu and other protest leaders 
tutu is to be joined at the head of the march by cape towns 
white mayor gordon oliver 
they and two other activists issued a statement inviting all cape 
town residents to join in a dignified peaceful procession 
under the theme peace in our city 
the statement said the marchers would demand removal of riot 
police from the townships a halt to detentions release of police 
records to lawyers and negotiations aimed at ending apartheid 
the government announced tuesday that maj gen jaap joubert a 
senior police investigator had been appointed to lead a probe into 
the allegations of police violence 
however lt gregory rockman a mixedrace policeman who has 
created a furor by accusing riot squad members of brutality said he 
was not satisfied and proposed a judge be appointed to oversee a 
public inquiry 
this just doesnt satisfy me rockman said of jouberts 
appointment they are just trying to cool us off 
rockman spoke after he and about 40 other mixedrace officers met 
with law and order minister adriaan vlok and police commanders from 
the cape town area where riot squads and protesters have clashed 
almost daily since early august 
tutu among others has hailed rockman as a hero for going public 
with his allegations that police behaved like wild dogs when 
they beat schoolchildren and bystanders during an antielection 
protest on sept 5 
the topranking mixedrace policeman col john manuel was among 
those who met with vlok afterward manuel said rockman has full 
support from his colleagues and from me 
in another development a former newspaper photographer told a 
news conference he had been a police spy for the past two years 
providing information about antiapartheid journalists and 
organizations 
gregory flatt 21 said he was coerced into becoming an informer 
while in detention in early 1987 
he said he decided to confess his role because of the election 
night violence and because he was impressed by rockmans courage 
both flatt and rockman are from the mixedrace township of 
mitchells plain 
flatt formerly worked for south an antiapartheid weekly 
newspaper published in cape town 
i betrayed the cause of my people and helped to maintain an 
unjust system flatt said

opponents of the governments plan to close 
some military bases got a mild victory tuesday as a senate 
subcommittee voted to tie the future of the domestic bases to a 
congressional audit 
the 2882 billion military spending bill approved by the 
appropriations defense subcommittee contains a provision that would 
prevent closure unless an audit determines the savings to the 
pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of locking the gates 
a similar effort died in the house in july but the senate 
measure is considered attractive because the general accounting 
office audit would include all 86 bases targeted by a government 
commission the house amendment affected only 15 
critics have accused the commission on base closure and 
realignment of using faulty data in the cases of some of the bases 
ordered to close by sept 30 1995 they also question whether the 
commission considered the cost of environmental cleanup at the sites 
the commission said the government would save 56 billion over 
20 years if the bases are closed 
the senate appropriations committee will consider the defense 
bill on thursday 
we view this as incremental progress said david carle 
spokesman for sen paul simon dill whose state includes chanute 
air force base in rantoul and fort sheridan in chicago two bases 
ordered to close 
it shows that the subcommittee is daring to open the 
baseclosing issue carle said

backers of expanded drilling for oil on the 
outer continental shelf contended tuesday that the huge spill from 
the exxon valdez tanker is impossible with an offshore rig 
a greater risk comes from foreign tankers carrying foreign oil 
representatives of the petroleum industry and interior department 
told a house merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee 
ocs outer continental shelf oil and gas development is 
inherently safer than importing oil on tankers said barry a 
williamson director of the minerals management service at the 
interior department he noted that two of three oil spills in us 
waterways shortly after the march 24 exxon valdez accident involved 
foreign vessels 
every barrel we dont produce from ocs is another barrel that 
must be imported he added 
if we dont move forward with a domestic ocs program our 
country is going to suffer in the future said rep jack fields 
rtexas 
the national audubon society contended however that the 
pollution from offshore rigs consists of more than the spillage 
contrary to popular thinking a significant amount of ocs oil and 
gas activities takes place on coastal landfall areas and in 
nearshore waters said dorene bolze an analyst for the group 
for example there are the residues of drilling muds and 
cuttings and the liquids brought to the floor by drilling all of 
which may contain contaminants including toxic materials 
additionally there is the problem of air and noise pollution 
spills from ships used to transport the oil and damage to wetlands 
from pollution pipeline digging and other construction the group 
says 
most of the oil produced in the gulf of mexico is brought to land 
by pipeline 
as a result of major offshore oil rig disasters in 1969 and 1970 
one off santa barbara calif and two involving fires in the gulf 
of mexico federal regulation of the industry intensified 
there have been no well blowouts spilling more than 200 barrels 
into federal waters since 1970 according to interior department 
figures cited in the hearing 
a 1985 report by the national academy of sciences quoted freely 
in the hearing estimated that the oil spilled from offshore oil 
production accounted for only 2 percent of the total marine oil 
spillage worldwide 
the valdez accident by contrast resulted in the release of more 
than 250000 barrels or 11 million gallons 
drilling advocates say that kind of release is impossible not 
only because of the regulations and safety measures that have been 
put in place but also because the offshore wells produce oil at 
only eight barrels an hour 
tuesdays hearing of the panama canal and outer continental shelf 
subcommittee was not to consider any legislation but occurred 
against a backdrop of responses to the valdez incident several 
subcommittees were making lastminute adjustments to oil spill 
cleanup legislation resulting from the valdez accident before 
committee and house action later this week 
most outer continental shelf production is in the gulf of mexico 
and pacific ocean off california an administration task force is 
studying some of the more controversial lease sales off florida and 
the gulf coast of florida and is expected to make recommendations to 
president bush in december

the nations envionmental chief taking sides 
in a bitter costsharing dispute over president bushs clean air 
bill said tuesday the proposal would not force nine states to pay 
more than their fare share to curtail acid rain 
william k reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency strongly contradicted figures released by rep philip r 
sharp dind that suggested electric utility customers in the nine 
states would pay a disproportionate amount of the cost of reducing 
acid rain emissions 
at a hearing of the house energy and commerce energy and power 
subcommittee chaired by sharp reilly released his own statistics 
that contended the nine states would get a fair deal under the bush 
legislation 
the states are pennsylvania west virginia georgia ohio 
illinois indiana kentucky tennessee and missouri 
sharp has demanded that electric utility customers in those 
states receive financial help in paying for power plant reductions 
of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that form the acid 
rain compound 
this could be accomplished by forcing industries to reduce their 
emissions of these same chemicals or have electric utility 
customers elsewhere pay part of the tab through special fees 
but reilly lawmakers from outside the nine states and at least 
one house member from tennessee democratic rep jim cooper argued 
that other states utility customers already are financing the cost 
of reductions made by their own utilities 
reilly added that plants other than utilities account for just 30 
percent of the problem and it would be much more efficient to order 
all the reductions from the utilities which cause 70 percent of the 
pollution these are power plants that burn highsulfur coal much 
of it mined in west virginia 
bushs legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airborne 
chemicals ozone and the acid rain which is carried for hundreds of 
miles before falling to earth acid rain destroys lakes kills 
trees makes buildings deteriorate and causes lung problems 
the president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons 
by the year 2000 based on 1980 levels with nine million tons 
coming from power plants and one million from industrial emission 
reductions already achieved there would be an emissions cap to 
prevent future releases from offsetting the reductions 
sharp began his hearing tuesday by citing new figures that 
contend the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77 percent 
of the acid rain emissions even though they cause only 50 percent 
of the problem 
he contended that in the initial phase of the program utility 
customers in the nine states would pay for fully 90 percent of the 
cleanup 
but reilly then presented his own statistics which said that the 
nine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but their 
actual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total 
thats as fair as we can possibly make it he said adding 
the bush legislation is fair to those who cleaned up in the past 
it doesnt make them pay to clean up again 
sharp contended some utility rates could rise by 20 percent in 
the nine states but reilly said the five hardesthit states would 
see utility bills rise on the average a third of a cent per 
killowatthour by the year 2001

the house voted tuesday to reverse a 1985 
reagan administration decision to include the us postal services 
revenues and expenditures in the federal budget a move designed in 
part to stave off a rate increase 
the bill approved 40511 would insulate the postal service from 
deficitreduction efforts giving it the same offbudget status 
accorded social security 
it is designed to enable the postal service to operate in a 
more businesslike manner and to relieve some of the pressure for 
increased postal rates a spokesman for the post office and civil 
service committee said the bill now goes to the senate 
in 1985 budget director david stockman included postal service 
receipts and expenditures in the next years federal budget a 
practice that continues said rep william d ford dmich the 
committee chairman 
those receipts and disbursements now at least on paper affect 
the federal deficit ford said 
when congress ordered government agencies to reduce spending in 
1987 the postal service had to absorb a 12 billion cut he said 
as a result more than 700 post office construction projects were 
delayed or cancelled offices were closed on saturdays window hours 
were reduced and sunday mail processing was curtailed 
this year some budgeteers want to take another bite out of the 
postal service ford said in a floor speech the bush 
administration contends that a budget agreement with congressional 
leaders reached earlier this year requires shifting 400 million in 
postal revenues to the treasury he said 
ford said his committee rejects the idea its not good policy 
and it will accelerate the next rate increase he said 
most of the postal services 1990 budget will be generated by the 
mail system he said 
today no money is appropriated from the federal treasury to 
pay for the costs of delivering the mail ford said those costs 
are paid by postal ratepayers and the postal service as required 
by law is breaking even over the long haul

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
on tuesday painted a bleak picture of events in the israelioccupied 
territories and lebanon saying they were his biggest problems 
the situation in the middle east remains a profound and intense 
concern he wrote in his annual report not only because of the 
political principles at stake but also because of the widespread 
human suffering caused by failure to resolve those issues 
hopes for early progress in the peace process have sadly given 
way to mistrust and doubt among the parties concerned he said 
perez de cuellar referred to a november resolution by the 
palestinian national council the plos parliamentinexile that 
implicitly recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism 
but efforts to promote a dialogue between israelis and 
palestinians have been unsuccessful the secretarygeneral said he 
said his own attempts to start negotiations have been 
frustratingly inconclusive 
meanwhile he said the situation in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip grows steadily worse 
at least 567 palestinians have been killed by israelis in the 
21monthold uprising against israeli rule of the territories forty 
israelis also have been killed 
he said the security council repeatedly has called on israel to 
observe international conventions on protecting civilians in time of 
war despite appeals by the international community however 
widespread violation of human rights persist he said 
perez de cuellar called for negotiations taking fully into 
account the legitimate rights of the palestinian people including 
those of selfdetermination 
the longer such a process is delayed perez de cuellar said 
the greater will be the difficulties in intiating it and the more 
explosive the situation can become 
the secretarygeneral also said the world is appalled by the 
steady disintegration of government and society in lebanon and by 
the unprecedented violence in that countrys 14yearold civil war 
on aug 15 the secretarygeneral requested an urgent meeting of 
the security council on lebanon the council appealed to the 
christians and syrianmoslem alliance to lay down their weapons 
the secretarygeneral said he was pursuing contacts in liaison 
with a tripartite arab league committee to achieve a ceasefire 
perez de cuellar said the international community bears a 
responsibility to ensure restoration of the unity sovereignty 
territorial integrity and independence of lebanon as a member state 
of the united nations 
at least 847 people have died and 2528 have been wounded since 
march 8 when the most recent fighting in the sectarian civil war 
broke out between christian army units under gen michel aoun and 
syrian troops based in lebanon 
syrian troops entered lebanon in 1976 on an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate

congress must investigate the shipboard blast 
that killed 47 sailors on the uss iowa sen john glenn and rep 
mary rose oakar said tuesday 
there isnt any doubt that we have to look into it glenn 
said during a break in a private briefing by the iowa blasts chief 
investigator and other navy officials 
i want to find out if they reached the right conclusion and i 
want to make sure this never happens again said glenn dohio and 
a member of the senate armed services committee 
in my mind there are serious shortcomings in the way the navy 
conducted its inquiry and i want to make sure that the little 
persons voice is heard in this matter said oakar dohio who 
spent about four hours with the navy investigators in a separate 
briefing 
the pentagon released a report last week that said 
circumstantial evidence indicated gunners mate clayton hartwig 
intentionally sparked the april 19 uss iowa explosion probably in 
order to kill himself the report called hartwig the principal 
suspect but said it would be impossible to prove guilt because 
all those nearby died in the blast 
in cleveland the family of hartwig has criticized the navys 
report and characterized hartwig as a convenient scapegoat being 
used to deflect attention from what they consider the navys 
negligence 
oakar who represents part of cleveland said she would seek two 
probes a general accounting office investigation of navy procedures 
and equipment and a house armed services investigations subcommittee 
examination of the way the navy handled the iowa case 
i firmly believe the navy has some responsibility in this 
matter to make sure the reputations and families of the sailors who 
died in this tragedy are protected from allegations that cannot be 
proven she said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio who joined glenns briefing with 
rear adm richard d milligan said he was unhappy with the navys 
answers to his questions 
i would have difficulty arriving at the same conclusions the 
navy arrived at metzenbaum told reporters 
after reviewing the facts that led the navy to report that the 
explosion probably was deliberately caused by a suicidal sailor i 
would say it wouldnt even be enough evidence to submit to a grand 
jury said metzenbaum a lawyer 
metzenbaum stopped short of calling for congressional action but 
said my inclination is that there should be an investigation 
the navy has said it will tighten procedures on its ships as a 
result of its investigation which showed iowa officers were lax in 
instructing sailors on firing procedures 
meanwhile the pentagon released the first formal statement on the 
iowa report attributed to defense secretary dick cheney 
under difficult circumstances the investigating officer did a 
good and thorough job in trying to account for the factors which 
caused the tragic explosion onboard the uss iowa the statement 
said 
i am convinced based on the findings of the report that the 
16inch guns on us battleships are safe to fire and the fleet 
will accordingly go back to using them as to how the explosion 
happened the question is obviously not resolved the investigating 
officer offered his best conclusions as required under the navys 
investigative procedures

the ancestors of american indians will at 
last find their final resting place under a plan by the 
smithsonian institution to return indian remains to their tribes for 
burial the chairman of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs said tuesday 
the agreement which reverses a longstanding museum policy that 
made return of indian remains rare was added tuesday to a bill 
before the house that will establish a national museum of the 
american indian in washington 
there are many people in this nation who predicted not too long 
ago that this day would never come said the chairman sen daniel 
k inouye dhawaii 
today a process has started that will allow the ancestors of 
native americans to at last find their final resting place he 
added its a day that will be celebrated by indian leaders 
throughout indian country 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo an american indian 
instrumental in achieving the compromise with the museum said 
those remains that can be identified either specifically or by 
the name of tribe the smithsonian will notify the individuals in 
the tribe and the tribe will be able to have them returned to them 
under the agreement announced at a news conference the 
smithsonian will form a fiveperson commission including native 
americans to inventory and identify its collection of remains and 
funerary objects ceremonial items buried with the indians 
the legislation authorizes about 225 million for the process 
1 million directly to the smithsonian 1 million to the tribes 
and the remainder for operating costs 
the agreement represents a significant change of thinking by the 
administration of the smithsonian which previously had said the 
bones were necessary for scientific study 
it seems to me that as the head of the smithsonian i certainly 
have an obligation to try to retain what can be retained of our 
scientific collections smithsonian secretary robert mcc adams 
said at the news conference at the same time its obiviously 
incumbent on me to respect and try and alleviate the trauma of 
american indians 
suzan shown harjo executive director of the national congress of 
american indians said the smithsonian was setting a precedent bound 
to influence museums all over the country which have an estimated 
600000 indian remains 
identifying and returning the bones will probably take years 
and years adams said and many may not be identifiable 
the smithsonians collection comprises the bones of approximately 
18000 indians eskimos and aleuts many of which were unearthed 
during archaeological excavations construction or erosion the 
museum also has some 17000 funerary objects 
indian groups have sought the return of the remains for several 
years on religious grounds but adams had said the smithsonian would 
return only those that could be identified as stolen from graves or 
traced to living descendants as a result only 18 blackfoot remains 
have been returned in the last year and a half according to adams

soviet political maverick boris n yeltsin met 
briefly with president bush on tuesday and urged the administration 
and us business executives to help salvage the political and 
economic reforms being pushed by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
bush emphasized that the american people share his hope for the 
success of the reform movement in the soviet union the white 
house said in a short statement after the 15minute meeting 
bush told yeltsin his administration enjoys a very positive 
relationship with gorbachev and reiterated support for 
perestroika or the restructuring of soviet economic and political 
life the white house said 
the 58yearold yeltsin ousted as moscows communist party chief 
in late 1987 and then dumped from the ruling politburo was elected 
to parliament with overwhelming popular support in a contested 
election he arrived in the united states on a private tour saturday 
after meeting for nearly an hour with secretary of state james a 
baker iii yeltsin said he did not expect the united states to loan 
money to the kremlin but that he wanted american companies to 
invest in the soviet union 
in a statement the state department said that yeltsin offered 
his views on the kinds of changes that are taking place in the 
soviet union his assessment of where the reform process stood and 
of what would be needed for the reform process to move forward and 
succeed examples 
acceptance of existence of private property 
importance of a mixed economy 
enticing external investment in the soviet union 
mr yelstin made it very clear he would welcome us support 
for perestroika he does not want and is not seeking american 
grants rather he sees great virtue in private american investment 
in the soviet union 
yeltsin rushing from his meeting to catch an airplane to 
chicago told reporters that in my discussion with the president 
and vice president i made a list of 10 issues that could be 
discussed between us that could serve rescue perestroika 
he declined to give specifics but said the president supported 
the proposals that i suggested 
the state department said baker told yeltsin that in order to 
make the soviet union an attractive place for americans to invest 
the soviet union needs to address price reform and convertibility of 
the ruble 
the ruble the soviet currency is not generally traded on world 
currency exchanges a dollar buys many more rubles on the black 
market than it does in official transactions in soviet state banks 
a sign of an ailing economy the soviet government is sponsoring a 
worldwide competition among economists with a 25000 prize for the 
best plan to make the ruble convertible freely traded for dollars 
marks francs and other currencies 
yeltsins lowkey white house reception reflected bushs desire 
to avoid offending gorbachev presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the president didnt want to provide a platform for 
dissent 
in a speech at johns hopkins university in baltimore before going 
to washington yeltsin said gorbachev had made mistakes in his 
policy of social and economic reforms 
the situation in our country after 4 years of perestroika is 
very dangerous we have to combine our efforts to rescue 
perestroika which is in a supercritical situation today yeltsin 
said but he did not spell out what he thinks the kremlin needs from 
washington 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
said yeltsins views were his own and not necessarily the 
governments 
yeltsins white house visit included a private meeting with 
national security adviser brent scowcroft during which bush and 
vice president dan quayle dropped by fitzwater said 
defending a white house decision to bar the media and to limit 
yeltsins time with the president fitzwater said we dont want to 
do anything to foster internal conflict that might be associated 
with this trip 
we view him as one of the first elected representatives in the 
soviet union an important spokesman for his point of view 
fitzwater said about yeltsin 
yeltsin a critic of gorbachev has emerged as the leader of a 
small but vocal group of reformers within the newly constituted 
soviet parliament 
the group which includes nobel prize winner andrei d sakharov 
has stopped short of illegally forming a separate party or a 
splinter group within the communist party but is widely viewed as an 
opposition movement 
perestroika should not have been conducted on such a broad 
front we should have concentrated ourselves on such things as 
consumer goods and food yeltsin said in baltimore arguing that 
would have improved soviet life and won greater support 
yeltsin told reporters in baltimore that he approved of the 
exodus of thousands of east germans through hungary to west germany 
where they have been granted citizenship 
it should be regulated by international agreements stating that 
people have the right to live where they want yeltsin said 
he said he was not opposed to unification of germany but said it 
was not practical now leaders of communist east germany oppose 
unification 
gorbachev could face an upheaval from below if soviet life is not 
improved within a year yeltsin said repeating past assertions 
in washington yeltsin also met with nine senators in the office 
of sen bill bradley dnj but failed to appear at a luncheon 
where he was to address about 50 people including sen barbara 
mikulski dmd rep steny hoyer dmd and former national 
security adviser zbigniew brzezinski 
yeltsin whose visit was organized by the esalen institute 
sovietamerican exchange program is receiving 25000 per speech 
the money will pay for the trip and contribute to aids research in 
the soviet union

top administration officials said tuesday they 
would urge president bush to veto a democratic plan to expand his 
antidrug fight by 22 billion saying it simply throws money at 
the problem 
democrats stuck with their proposal which would beef up 
treatment prevention and law enforcement initiatives saying it was 
a badly needed response to the growing problem of illegal drug use 
and drugrelated violence 
administration officials talked of a possible veto as bush made a 
live televised appeal from the white house to millions of 
schoolchildren urging them to stay away from drugs and telling them 
that refusing drugs wont make you a nerd 
im asking you to not to look the other way bush said im 
asking you to find someone who needs you and offer to help ill 
say it again if youre not in trouble help someone who is 
democrats said they would finance their proposal with 
acrosstheboard cuts in hundreds of federal programs and sought to 
graft the proposal to an unrelated appropriations bill on the senate 
floor 
white house officials met privately with senate republican 
leaders as both sides held closeddoor meetings on the latest round 
of political maneuvering over the drug issue 
were going to see how strongly byrd feels about this and were 
going to ask for negotiations senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas said about the democratic proposal sponsored by senate 
appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
doles comments followed a onehour meeting in his capitol office 
attended by white house chief of staff john sununu administration 
budget director richard darman defense secretary dick cheney drug 
coordinator william j bennett and several top gop senators 
alternatives to byrds package including a 18 billion plan 
sponsored by a democrat and a republican emerged elsewhere on 
capitol hill 
bennett told a house committee the administration envisioned its 
efforts costing 50 billion over five years while a senate panel 
approved a pentagon spending bill with more than 1 billion for 
antidrug efforts 
the white houses office of management and budget distributed a 
statement saying that bush had made the tough choices when he 
unveiled his 79 billion antidrug plan last week bushs top drug 
advisers will urge the president to veto the democratic 
drugfighting proposal omb said 
the proposed emergency drug amendment makes no choices the 
statement said it throws money at the problem rather than 
providing a plan 
democrats held their ground 
were not waiting for an invasion byrd said the invasion 
has already begun 
byrd with the support of senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine offered the package as an amendment to a bill providing 
119 billion for transportation programs for fiscal 1990 which 
begins oct 1 
to raise the money for the drug initiatives democrats proposed 
slicing 0575 percent off most defense and domestic programs 
exempting social security medicare and other benefits 
but administration officials objected saying that would result 
in a 18 billion cut in defense spending way out of proportion 
to the cutbacks that domestic programs would suffer 
pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters there that the 
democratic plan was like taking a simple meat ax to the defense 
departments budget and said it would create havoc 
republicans also objected to the way the democratic proposal 
would distribute its extra funds 53 percent for law enforcement and 
47 percent for treatment and prevention efforts 
that of course changes the presidents entire drug program 
said senate gop leader bob dole of kansas 
the democratic plan would increase the federal antidrug budget 
by 39 billion above the amount congress had planned to spend byrd 
said 
the new spending would include 11 billion for drug and alcohol 
treatment 1 billion for new prisons 200 million to help state 
and local law enforcement agencies 97 million for the fbi and 100 
million for public housing authorities to fight drug problems 
bennetts prediction before the house foreign affairs committee 
that administration antidrug efforts would cost 50 billion over 
five years was met with objections from several members who said it 
would be unacceptable for the administration to find those funds by 
shifting money out of other vital domestic programs 
the committee chairman rep dante fascell dfla told bennett 
i dont want to see one dime diverted from from essential 
domestic purposes that are in fact part of the drug problem i think 
that would be a tragic mistake 
elsewhere 
the senate appropriations commerce justice and state 
subcommittee approved a measure that would cut defense and many 
domestic programs by 0225 percent and use the 18 billion raised 
to pay for antidrug law enforcement programs the provision 
adopted on a voice vote was sponsored by subcommittee chairman 
ernest hollings dsc and the panels ranking republican warren 
rudman rnh 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said hollings proposal 
would cut 675 million from the pentagons budget an amount 
fitzwater said was tolerable 
we have told hollings we would reluctantly support his 
compromise fitzwater said 
the senate appropriations defense subcommittee approved a 2797 
billion military spending bill for next year containing 105 
billion for drug efforts eight times the 132 million bush had 
requested 
the package includes a transfer of 300 million in cash and 
equipment to the coast guard 118 million for existing defense 
department drugtreatment and education programs 60 million for 
surveillance planes and ships and 40 million for the national guard 
top administration drug officials and a congressional staff 
report said officials ought to focus on developing strategic 
information on colombian cocaine cartels rather than on immediate 
busts and asset seizures to nail entire organizations 
longterm cases which produce continuing intelligence data that 
can be used to dismantle whole organizations are favored over 
buybust type cases william baker the fbis assistant director 
for intelligence told the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations 
to the cartels baker said the arrests of lowlevel noncritical 
cartel employees and the daily seizure of multihundred kilograms of 
cocaine are merely the costs of doing business

passengers and most of the crew he has never been located and his 
body was never found 
from the time of the hijacking some investigators have 
speculated that list was cooper because the mens descriptions are 
similar and because of lists disappearance after the new jersey 
killings 
the story surfaced anew after a man police said was list was 
arrested june 1 in richmond va 
theres nothing to indicate to us to that hes db cooper 
said capt frank marranca head of the homicide squad at the union 
county prosecutors office the fbi has reached a similar 
conclusion he said 
there are a couple of other facts that would tend to not put 
him as db cooper said marranca who refused to reveal the 
evidence saying it would be relevant to lists trial 
jon eyer fbi assistant agent in charge in seattle said there is 
nothing at this point that conclusively points to list being cooper 
or not being cooper 
he said the fbi has been investigating a whole slew of leads 
and circumstances in the case but theyre not focusing 
necessarily on list and they never were hes only one of many 
possibilities eyer said 
marranca said investigation showed list had no paratroop 
experience in service during world war ii and the korean war 
marranca said 
no date has been set for the trial which could lay the issue to 
rest once and for all if prosecutors prove lists whereabouts two 
weeks after the killings 
lists wife three children and mother were found murdered in 
their home in december 1971 
a man who identified himself as robert b clark was arrested in 
richmond and accused of being list following a tip by the viewer of 
a crime recreation television program

a divided senate voted tuesday to confirm 
donald gregg as ambassador to south korea dismissing claims that 
his repeated denials of involvement in the irancontra affair are 
absurd on their face 
the vote was 66 to 33 fortyfive republicans and 21 democrats 
voted for the gregg nomination while 33 democrats voted against it 
greggs gop defenders contended his democratic foes were using 
the nominee in a desperate attempt to attempt revive the irancontra 
furor and attack president bush who nominated his close associate 
for the job 
but one democrat sen charles robb dva said he too had 
concluded gregg was blameless and would support the nomination out 
of conscience and conviction 
robb discounted greggs links to the irancntra affair and 
mounted a 45minute pointbypoint defense 
shortly before the vote senate majority leader george mitchell 
of maine said he had reached the opposite conclusion because the 
explanations offered by him are so inconsistent with the known facts 
that they cannot be believed 
even if it was proved that gregg told nothing but the truth his 
nomination should still be rejected because his testimony casts 
serious doubt on his judgment mitchell said 
gregg a 30year veteran of the central intelligence agency who 
once was cia station chief in seoul served in bushs vice 
presidential office as his chief foreign policy adviser 
the gregg nomination has been pending since early march in two 
sessions before the senate foreign relations committee gregg 
denied under oath allegations he was ever involved in the secret 
and illegal effort to resupply the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the sharply divided panel eventually voted 127 to recommend the 
full senate confirm the nomination 
mr gregg has clearly not been straight with us said sen 
alan cranston dcalif as debate opened in the senate few who 
have reviewed the record have come away with any confidence in mr 
greggs veracity 
cranston told his colleagues if we were to promote a man we 
believed to have misled us under oath we would invite contempt for 
our inquiries we would encourage frustration of our constitutional 
obligations 
cranston has led the attempt to sidetrack or defeat the gregg 
nomination in his position as chairman of the asian affairs 
subcommitee 
sen albert gore dtenn scoffed at greggs explanation why 
bushs agenda for two separate meetings as vice president included 
the subject of contra resupply 
gregg testified they were typos and should have read copter 
resupply referring to an issue involving helicopters for the 
armed forces in el salvador 
what does he take the senate for and what do we take him for 
gore asked are we to seriously accept a baldfaced presentation 
of that kind its absurd on its face 
to vote to confirm we have to believe this nominee did not lie 
brazenly and repeatedly gore said its a little difficult to 
swallow 
gregg testified he never informed bush about a warning he 
received about the resupply operation until after he gave an 
interview about it to reporters of the new york times 
he would have us believe that his boss read about it in the 
paper gore said it appears that he may have been prepared to 
preserve deniability for his boss and he was prepared to go to 
extraordinary lengths to do so 
but sen jesse helms rnc the senior gop member on the 
foreign relations committee called gregg a man of integrity and 
honesty and said his detractors see in him a good way to bash 
george bush 
i think it is fair to say that mr gregg was masterful in 
refuting the major allegations against him helms said 
lets get george bush thats what this is all about get 
george bush tear him down helms said

border officials monitoring entry into 
hungary suggested tuesday that the flow of refugees to the west had 
peaked saying the number of east german visitors was usual for this 
time of year 
they sought to softpedal suggestions that a majority of the more 
than 50000 east germans reported on vacation in hungary could join 
others who had formally requested to leave for a new life in the 
west 
maj janos hornyak of the border guards said 6529 east germans 
had arrived between 630 am monday and 930 am tuesday 
he said that 3220 east germans left for home over the same time 
via czechoslovakia which is sandwiched between hungary and east 
germany 
most entered from czechoslovakia and the rest from romania he 
said adding the figures were normal for this time of year 
hungarian radio reported without sourcing later tuesday that 750 
east germans arrived from czechoslovakia during the afternoon and 
336 left for home 
hungarian tv said that since the start of the exodus monday 103 
east gemans illegally crossed from czechoslovakia into hungary 
presumably to go west over the open borders 
only 210 east germans registered overnight with authorities at a 
refugee camp coordinating the exodus westward 
some east germans arriving in hungary over the last 24 hours were 
presumably crossing into austria on their own but the low number of 
new registrations also indicated that the stream westward was ebbing 
hungarian border officials said tuesday that 16000 east germans 
crossed into hungary during the weekend but said this was not an 
unusually high number as hungary is a popular vacation spot for 
nationals of several soviet bloc countries 
they stressed that more east germans 26000 left on the 
weekend than came to hungary over the same time cautioning against 
thinking that each east german visitor was a wouldbe refugee 
the exodus to west germany began sunday midnight after hungary 
defied a 1969 agreement with east germany its warsaw pact ally and 
opened its borders for thousands who turned their back on their 
hardline communist nation 
before that more than 6000 fled over relatively open stretches 
into austria after hungary decided to start clearing its westernmost 
border of barbed wire and other barriers in may 
east germany fiercely criticized the hungarian move it was the 
first time a warsaw pact country helped citizens of an allied nation 
flee to the west 
the east berlin leadership on tuesday formally protested to 
hungary and asked it to stop the exodus 
accusing budapest of direct interference in east germanys 
international affairs the state adn news agency said hungary was 
responsible for the current situation 
other reports in the state media suggested hungary was bought off 
by west germany which grants all east germans citizenship upon 
request hungarian government and communist party dailies 
emphatically denied it 
hungarian and east german officials met for weeks trying to agree 
on what to do with the refugees and hungarian foreign minister 
gyula horn said sunday the borders were opened after the talks 
failed 
on tuesday horn told hungarian radio the east german remarks 
were offensive 
as part of major reforms that include free elections planned by 
next june the communist government is drafting laws giving 
hungarian citizens the right to emigrate freely 
austrian border officials also suggested that the refugee stream 
was ebbing 
they said more than 8000 crossed into austria on their way to 
their final destination in the first 24 hours but only an 
additional 2500 did so between monday midnight and noon an 
additional 524 crossed during the afternoon bringing the total to 
slightly more than 11000 
that exceeded by about 4000 the number of refugees who 
registered to leave at seven holding camps 
the busiest of the seven austrian border crossings tuesday was 
nickelsdorf about 50 miles south of vienna 
hungarys official mti news agency said authorities planned to 
close the refugee camps but did not say when all except one were 
already out of operation tuesday at a facility in the buda hills 
240 east germans arrived overnight and left for austria on six buses 
at noon 
speculation arose that east germany would bar further travel to 
hungary following hungarys decision but several new arrivals at 
zugliget camp told reporters they were allowed to leave their 
homeland less than 24 hours earlier 
but one young woman who refused to give her name said east 
german border soldiers treated some of them roughly before letting 
them cross into czechoslovakia 
they searched through everything she said some of us had 
to undress almost completely but then we could continue on our 
way 
interior minister istvan horvath said it was not up to hungary to 
stop east germans from entering and suggested without specifically 
saying so that hungary should not stop them from leaving 
if east germany allows its citizens to leave the country we 
certainly cannot restrict their movement he told the hungarian 
communist daily nepszabadsag

anton lubowski the only white to hold a 
leadership post in the southwest africa peoples organization 
guerrilla movement was assassinated tuesday outside his home in 
suburban windhoek police said 
lt kierie du rand a police spokesman said lubowksi was shot in 
the head at about 850 pm by an assailant who drove away in a red 
sedan du rand said an allout manhunt had been launched 
lubowski 37 was an unofficial spokesman for swapo the namibian 
independence movement that had waged a bush war against south 
african rule of the territory since 1966 
south africa has agreed to grant independence expected by early 
next year as part of a regional peace accord also calling for 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
lubowski was also a member of swapos election directorate which 
is overseeing the movements campaign for unsupervised elections 
scheduled for early november swapo is favored to win most votes in 
the election but it needs a twothirds majority to control the 
drafting of a constitution 
the assassination occurred just two days before the scheduled 
homecoming of swapo president sam nujoma who has been in exile for 
30 years 
a police officer at the scene said lubowski was killed by several 
shots fired at close range from a sovietmade ak47 automatic rifle 
ak47s were used by swapo during the bush war and could be 
obtained through contacts either with the guerrilla movement or with 
the security forces which captured numerous weapons 
a neighbor said the person who fired the gun got back into a car 
carrying at least one other person but there was no description of 
the attackers 
the south africanappointed administrator of namibia louis 
pienaar expressed shock at the killing and said the authorities 
will not allow circumstances of anarchy to develop in the runup 
to the election 
pienaar said the assassination was part of a spiral of 
violence that included the fatal stoning of a white police officer 
over the weekend by a crowd of blacks 
lubowksi studied at stellenbsch and cape town universities two 
of south africas best at one point an officer in the south african 
army lubowski a lawyer joined swapos legal political wing in 
1984 
although his law practice was in windhoek he represented many 
antiapartheid activists in trials in south africa 
he recently helped defend 14 blacks convicted of murdering a 
black policeman in 1985 they were sentenced to hang under the 
doctrine of common purpose which held them responsible even 
though only one contributed physically to the policemans death 
last week south africas appeals court granted the socalled 
upington 14 the right to appeal their death sentences 
lubowski was divorced his two children live with his exwife in 
south africa 
the namibianborn lubowski had received numerous death threats 
since joining swapo said gwen mckinney director of the namibia 
information office in washington 
she said lubowski who had installed an elaborate security system 
in his house died at the scene

lyubimov about the staging of the first part the rhine gold 
lyubimov argued at length during rehearsals with the royal 
operas dutch music director bernard haitink over presentation of 
the work 
the eventual production won the acclaim of most of the audiences 
and every seat was sold for the six performances 
but the backstage argument could not be resolved

berlin and later adapted for touring in japan and the united states

a new museum named for the late photographer 
ansel adams opens sunday and promises to become one of the worlds 
leading centers for creative photography supporters said during a 
preview tuesday 
if he were here right now i think he would be absolutely 
elated said ron egherman executive director of the ansel adams 
center 
adams whose blackandwhite landscapes influenced generations of 
photographers and helped elevate the medium to the level of art 
died five years ago 
he would be thrilled not only at the fact that his longterm 
dream of always supporting finearts photography was achieved but 
also to have his work shown in contrast to the work of other 
artists egherman said 
one of the 1 million museums five galleries will be devoted to 
adams the other galleries will exhibit works by local 
photographers other contemporary artists traditional and 
historical photographers and people who are challenging the 
frontiers of what is photography what is art egherman said 
the museum has 6000 square feet of exhibition space additional 
space for workshops and offices for publishing works by contemporary 
photographers and room for expansion the adams center expects 
75000 to 100000 visitors its first year egherman said 
the museum is across the street from the moscone convention 
center in an area that is expected to eventually include the san 
francisco museum of modern art a visual arts center a theater and 
a cinema arts complex 
the adams center is run by the friends of photography a 
10000member group started 22 years ago by adams and other top 
photographers 
the friends original museum was in carmel but the group 
seeking a larger space and hoping to attract more attention decided 
several years ago to move it to san francisco adams birthplace 
most of the cost of building the adams center came from member 
donations a blacktie fund raiser friday will be attended by adams 
widow virginia historianphotographer beaumont newhall and other 
leading photographers 
newhall former curator of photography at new yorks museum of 
modern art and a founding member of the friends said the adams 
center should soon become a leading center for photography along 
with the george eastman house in rochester ny and new yorks 
international center of photography 
newhall said the adams center also will add to the growing 
acceptance of photography as an art form 
there is a minority who wont accept photography as an art 
form but theres been a great acceptance by curators and the 
public he said this center will only increase that perception 
its a tremendous memorial to a man who meant so much to us and a 
great new center for photography

the bush administration plans to propose to 
congress that the united states next year accept 50000 soviet 
refugees plus 6500 more from eastern europe a us official and 
sources in the american jewish community said tuesday 
worldwide 125000 refugees would be admitted an increase of 
slightly less than 8 percent from this year 
the 50000 soviet refugees at least half of whom are expected to 
be jews are a fraction of the 250000 soviet citizens the state 
department estimated last week would apply for entry to the united 
states in 1990 
of the 50000 the sources said 40000 would have their 
transportation and settlement costs paid by the united states the 
10000 others would have to depend on private organizations friends 
and relatives 
this years combined quota for refugees from the soviet union and 
eastern europe is 50000 the new plan would allocate 50000 slots 
to the soviet union and set up a separate category of 6500 for 
eastern europe 
last year as emigration from the soviet union began to climb 
the combined quota for the soviet union and eastern europe was 
15000 
jewel s lafontant the state departments refugee affairs 
coordinator is scheduled to testify to a house judiciary 
subcommittee wednesday about the administration proposal 
an estimated 40000 soviet jews are expected to leave the soviet 
union this year currently there is a backlog of an estimated 30000 
to 40000 jews with exit permits for israel who have not left the 
soviet union or are in vienna and rome seeking entry to the united 
states 
most soviet jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in 
israel all but a fraction however then apply for admission to the 
united states once they have left their country 
according to the jewish sources who demanded anonymity the bush 
administration will also drastically revise its processing 
procedures tentatively refugees who apply before oct 1 the 
beginning of the 1990 fiscal year will be processed in rome and 
vienna 
thereafter applications will be handled by a beefedup us 
embassy staff in moscow and by a new office to be set up outside 
washington 
the us official who also asked not to be named said that the 
oct 1 cutoff date was very likely but that it might be set back a 
few months 
while the soviets seeking admission remain in their country 
their applications would be considered both in moscow and in the 
washington area office 
israel has expressed concern that jewish refugees from the soviet 
union were increasingly choosing to head for the united states once 
out of their homeland depriving the jewish state of needed settlers 
it was not clear whether the change in us procedure would 
increase the flow of refugees to israel 
the rising exodus from the soviet union which results from us 
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by president mikhail s 
gorbachev poses administrative and financial problems for the bush 
administration 
eager to reinforce the right of soviet citizens to travel freely 
us officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open 
but beyond the 50000 slots allotted for the soviet union 
prospective jewish emigres will be encouraged to apply for parole 
status this requires private support for the immigrants 
also the sources said in admitting 50000 refugees from the 
soviet union preference will be given to those with close relatives 
here but no applicant will be declared ineligble on the grounds he 
has no relative here the officials said

prosecutors say he used nearly 4 million in ministry funds to 
finance a lavish lifestyle 
taggart and his brother david were convicted of evading 525000 
in income taxes on money they received from ptl prosecutors have 
indicated they might support a reduction in the taggarts sentences 
in exchange for testimony against bakker 
under crossexamination by defense lawyer harold bender taggart 
testified that other celebrities also used the presidential suite 
but they had to be cleared through bakkers office 
a former ptl attorney john yorke said he sent a memo to his law 
firm boss former charlotte mayor eddie knox citing concerns about 
1983 wages earned by the bakkers 
together jim and tammy have a monthly income of more than 
30000 he said jim has already received one bonus this year 
totaling 390000 he could possibly earn more than 1 million this 
year

at ptl including risking ptls taxexempt status because of high 
salaries nepotism and a lack of legal advice at ptl board meetings 
yorke also described bakkers reaction to bad news jim didnt 
like to hear bad news on several occasions when eddie knox got 
stern with him he turned around and wouldnt look at him

said until he left yorkes firm was replaced as ptl attorneys 
in 1986 
guy forcucci a certified public accountant who worked for ptl in 
the early 1980s and prepared bakkers individual income tax returns 
testified he had warned bakker as early as 1982 about his high 
salary 
bakkers 1982 tax return showed he earned 290000 forcucci 
testified he said he warned bakker the following year after the 
ptl leaders salary rose to 461000 
ptls taxexempt status ultimately was revoked following bakkers 
resignation in march 1987 
in other testimony thomas trask treasurer of the assemblies of 
god of springfield mo testified that bakker had nearly 794000 
in the denominations retirement account on may 6 1987 bakker is 
barred from making further contributions because he has been 
defrocked by the church 
michael dixon a franklin tenn music agent for the bakkers 
daughter tammy sue testified he was paid more than 96000 by ptl 
to devise a marketing scheme for tammy sues recordings testimony 
showed bakker purchased more than 600000 worth of music equipment 
for his home 
us district judge robert potter lectured bakker for not 
reporting to his probation officer monday for a weekly report on 
medication he is taking bakkers lawyer harold bender went to the 
probation office instead and apologized in court 
prosecutors continued their practice of this week of 
interspersing testimony about the bakkers lifestyle with testimony 
from people who sent them money prosecutors contend that bakker 
took money sent by his followers called partners if they gave 
1000 and didnt use it to construct hotel rooms he promised in 
broadcasts and in mailings partners were told they could stay free 
in a ptl hotel once a year 
sarah combs of spanishburg wva said she and her husband a 
disabled coal miner lived on 400 a month but they decided to use 
1000 out of 19000 her husband received for medical compensation 
for black lung disease caused by breathing coal dust for a 
partnership in the heritage grand hotel 
but she was never able to stay there despite repeated attempts 
she said 
every time i called i would talk to someone else and they 
would give me a different reason why there wasnt any room she 
said 
in testimony monday taggart said bakker joked about his finances 
for expensive trips telling those with him to thank the ptl 
partners

the army chief of staff sent a letter to the 
soldiers in the occupied territories cautioning against the use of 
excess force when suppressing riots or arresting palestinians a 
spokesman said tuesday 
also tuesday finance minister shimon peres head of the 
leftleaning labor party said he would demand a cabinet decision on 
egypts middle east peace proposal if palestinians accept the plan 
the army gave excerpts from the letter from lt gen dan shomron 
to the itim news agency the army spokesman said the letter was sent 
in the last few days 
shomron warned soldiers not to use brutality or to take 
unreasonable measures he gave specific examples such as beating 
prisoners in army custody or disrupting ambulances that are 
evacuating wounded 
violence may not be used after a mission has concluded for 
example or after a demonstration has been dispersed or after a man 
is already in our hands and there is no resistance shomron wrote 
in any incident the passage of ambulances and medical services 
must not be prevented 
israel radio said the justice ministry recommended that shomron 
send the letter after four soldiers were convicted of brutally 
beating an arab and contributing to his death 
shomron said soldiers may use force to disperse violent 
demonstrations and to make arrests according to army orders and 
the law from which there can be no deviations 
in all instances where force is used one must be strict and 
use reasonable force he wrote 
meanwhile officials of peres labor party intended to bring up 
the egyptian plan for discussion at a meeting wednesday of the 
12member inner cabinet israels army radio reported 
such a move was likely to increase divisions in the coalition 
government over prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace plan which 
calls for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip of 
palestinian representatives for talks with israel 
the 10point plan proposed by egyptian president hosni mubarak 
includes israeli acceptance of the usbacked concept of trading 
land for peace it also calls for allowing the 140000 arabs in 
annexed east jerusalem to vote 
those points are acceptable to labor but not to likud the 
israeli proposal worked out by the two parties deliberately leaves 
these issues open 
shamir leader of the rightist likud bloc has refused to discuss 
mubaraks proposals 
peres speaking on israel army radio said he supports most of 
mubaraks plan 
peres was asked about shamirs refusal to discuss the proposals 
and replied if it becomes clear that a palestinian delegation is 
ready to come equipped with the 10 points as their position the 
way to decide is a government meeting government discussions are 
not somebodys monopoly if we demand there is going to be a 
meeting 
in the occupied territories tuesday soldiers shot and wounded 12 
palestinians during clashes with stonethrowing youths arab 
hospital officials said 
the army confirmed one injury saying soldiers shot a teenager 
in the head when they were met with a hail of stones in the west 
bank village of sabastiya hospital officials said the victim was in 
serious condition 
during the 21monthold uprising 567 palestinians have been 
killed in clashes with the army and israeli civilians forty 
israelis also have been slain in the violence 
the army meanwhile was reported planning a new system of 
colorcoded identity cards to increase control over palestinians in 
the west bank officials of the military government refused to 
confirm or deny the report 
the daily yediot ahronot said the cards would have different 
colors or markings to show from which areas residents came and 
whether they were suspected of security offenss or crimes

an angry gov george sinner took federal 
officials on a tour of the missouri rivers largest reservoir 
tuesday hoping to persuade them to limit the amount of water 
released to aid navigation downstream 
lake sakakawea which pumps 40 million into the north dakota 
economy through tourism is at historic lows after two 
droughtridden summers and skimpy snow runoff upstream state and 
federal officials say 
two planeloads of officials including sinner an assistant army 
secretary and the commander of the army corps of engineers missouri 
river division toured the giant lake which has fallen 20 feet 
below its normal level for this time of year 
a public forum was scheduled for early evening 
the corps which has broad authority over water projects has 
been releasing water from lake sakakawea and other reservoirs to 
keep the missouri deep enough for boats and barges to navigate in 
states downstream commercial river traffic is negligible in north 
dakota 
i dont think anything has angered me as much as this 
project sinner said earlier i am literally at my wits end 
and so are a lot of other people we have become the fall guys for 
the downstream states 
sinner and south dakota gov george mickelson are pressing for a 
change in corps policy that would emphasize the recreational 
benefits of the missouri system over its navigation a change the 
corps says will be difficult to accomplish 
everybody thats impacted would have to become a party to 
agreeing upon such a change said duane sveum chief of the corps 
reservoir control center in omaha neb 
many businesses including four big resorts have grown up around 
lake sakakawea which is 178 miles long and has 1300 miles of 
recreational shoreline 
but the receding lake has left less than half of the lakes 39 
boat ramps in the water and publicity about the situation has 
scared away tourists state officials say 
the lakes elevation was measured tuesday at 1823 feet above sea 
level corps statistics dating back to 1967 show an average 
elevation of 18431 feet at septembers end said larry murphy an 
engineer in the corps reservoir control center in omaha neb 
murphy said the lake had 141 million acrefeet of stored water 
tuesday compared to a record september low of 148 million 
acrefeet recorded last year 
tracy potter assistant tourism director for the state economic 
development commission said lake sakakaweas elevation needed to be 
at 1830 feet to keep everybody in the water and happy 
but sveum said the lake was expected to drop as much as six 
additional feet by february 
a resort owner on the lakes southern little missouri arm mark 
slater called on sinner to declare the region a disaster area even 
though sinner said that suggestion was impractical 
slater closed his own resort aug 15 six weeks earlier than 
normal at an estimated loss of 100000 in revenue 
since we are selling the lake its hard to sell a lake when 
you dont have any water he said

and presidents office officials said they were unaware of the 
releases which came to light after a bogota newspaper article 
tuesday

against londono or orlandez after the eightday holding period 
permitted in colombia under special antidrug emergency measures

unprecedented crackdown on drugs aug 18

placed a cross on the body before the casket draped in a green and 
white antioquia state flag was closed

overcrowding at the harris county jail is not to 
blame for a mysterious flulike bacterial infection that has killed 
two inmates and sickened at least 35 the sheriff testified tuesday 
medical experts have said the illnesses have not been caused by 
overcrowding in the jail ssheriff johnny sklevenhagen told us 
district judge james deanda in opposing a lawsuit attempting to free 
as many as 500 misdemeanor prisoners 
the jail designed for 4200 inmates currently holds 8300 
tuesdays hearing was on a motion by attorney james oitzinger who 
represents inmates in a continuing lawsuit against crowding at the 
jail 
oitzinger sought the mass release on grounds that crowding may 
have contributed to the outbreak of infections by the pneumococcus 
bacteria he also asked the judge to isolate those at risk of 
contracting the infection 
jail officials say they have yet to identify a common source for 
the bacteria 
two doctors from the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta toured the jail monday with other health officials but have 
yet to comment on their findings 
late last week the bacterial infection killed inmates ricky 
labreck 30 and rene antonio fuentes 21 both had previously had 
their spleens removed for reasons unrelated to the outbreak and 
doctors said that left them more susceptible to the infection 
eighteen more inmates since have been admitted to ben taub 
hospital and the pneumococcus bacteria has been found in five of 
them hospital spokeswoman nora shire said tuesday 
the others have various flulike symptoms that may be early signs 
of the infection she said they also may be sick with the flu or 
some other type of mild infection 
in addition 20 to 30 were being evaluated at the jail infirmary 
for flulike symptoms said mark canfield chief of epidemiology 
with the harris county health department 
were taking blood to test for various types of viruses for 
weakening the immune symptoms canfield said at an afternoon news 
conference he said there is little data on a vaccine for 
pneuococcal disease but officials are looking into the availability 
and use of the vaccine 
klevenhagen said medical staff members at the jail were 
continuing to screen about 3200 inmates who said their medical 
histories include ailments like immune system problems that make 
them more susceptible to the infection 
although no specific measures were ordered by health authorities 
jail officials voluntarily canceled religious services recreational 
activities and classes monday

a retired federal judge has decreased the amount 
of damages recommended for french oyster growers who lost shellfish 
in the 1978 oil spill from the supertanker amoco cadiz attorneys 
said tuesday 
the adjustment in damages by former us district court judge 
frank mcgarr may hasten a final judgement in the case and pave the 
way for appeals said new york attorney barry kingham who 
represents the oyster growers and other plaintiffs along frances 
brittany coast 
denver attorney frank cicero who represents amoco corp the 
defendant said mcgarrs action would cut about 11 million plus 
interest from the total recommended damages which he now estimated 
at 100 million 
cicero said mcgarr at amocos request reexamined the testimony 
of a shellfish expert and determined that the expert failed to 
include include the fact that the french government had already 
awarded substantial compensation to the two groups of oystermen 
affected by the oil spill 
mcgarr then reduced the possible damages against amoco by the 
amount already paid by the french 
basically hes gone back to his original damage estimate 
kingham said in a telephone interview hes adjusted it several 
times since first delivering it in 1988 
mcgarr has served as special master in the case since his 
retirement in 1984 shortly after he ruled that amoco was liable 
his recommendations on damages are being passed on to us district 
judge charles norgle who is expected to rule on the amount of 
damages some time before the end of the year 
we intend to appeal all of the damages including those to the 
oyster growers said kingham who also represents some 100 french 
towns two counties hotel keepers and fishermen affected by the oil 
spill 
the amoco cadiz struck rocks two miles off the britanny coast on 
march 16 1978 the huge tanker had lost the use of its rudder and 
was under tow through the english channel by a germanowned tug when 
the towlines snapped in hurricaneforce winds 
the resulting 68 million gallon oil slick was 18 miles wide and 
80 miles long it fouled 100 miles of brittany beaches with tar 
killing thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures 
by comparison the exxon valdez spill in alaskas prince william 
sound was 11 million gallons

treasury secretary nicholas brady on tuesday 
warned that america was in danger of losing out in international 
competition unless the country did something about its inadequate 
savings rate and american businesses stopped chasing after quick 
profits 
bradys comments represented the opening salvo in what is 
expected to be a major new intiative on the part of the bush 
administration to boost americas competitive standing in the world 
traditionally the whole american workforce from the 
boardrooms to the factory floors shared a pride in their work 
unequaled in the world brady said however in recent years we 
have neglected our traditional strengths and have seen the other 
nations move forward to challenge our position in the world 
economy 
in remarks to 100 of the countrys top business executives 
gathered for dinner in the treasury departments ornate cash room 
brady decried what he saw as an emphasis on shortterm gains and a 
loss of commitment to plan for the future 
weve been willing to mortgage our future to sacrifice quality 
and to cut corners in the pursuit of the immediate payoff brady 
said it worries me when i see many of the best minds in america 
concentrating on financial engineering rather than laying plans for 
sound corporate strategies for the future 
brady told the business leaders that the president considered the 
problem one of his top priorities but he conceded in answer to a 
question that the administration had not yet resolved the question 
of how to offer tax breaks to increase savings without worsening the 
governments budget deficit 
he said the president hoped to have concrete proposals to offer 
in the area of boosting savings when he presents his next budget to 
congress in january 
if you set goals and have the backing of the president then you 
can do some things that are pretty amazing brady said making a 
pitch to the business leaders to support the administrations effort 
we must work together to find new ways to encourage americans 
to take the longterm view in their economic thinking as we work to 
preserve americas economic leadership and our standard of living 
he said 
bradys remarks were to a dinner meeting of the american business 
conference composed of the chief executive officers of 100 of the 
fastest growing companies in the nation 
earlier in the year the group produced its own study which 
singled out a decline in the personal savings rate as the biggest 
economic problem facing the united states and the chief cause of its 
huge trade deficits 
in his speech brady said that the administration was considering 
ways to boost the personal savings rate as a way of increasing the 
pool of funds from which businesses could borrow to make longterm 
investment 
if we provided for more of our domestic investment needs with 
our savings wed have to import less capital from abroad thus 
improving our trade balance brady said 
while brady did not spell out what options were being considered 
other treasury officials have said the administration is examining 
the possibility of broadening the use of taxdeferred individual 
retirement accounts the 1986 tax law sharply curbed ira tax 
benefits for workers who made more than 40000 a year and were 
covered by a company retirement plan 
brady said the administration would be looking at a number of 
options that give people the incentive to save instead of to 
consume 
brady said the administration was also considering proposing the 
removal of the current double taxation on dividends earned by a 
companys stockholders brady such a change would lower the cost of 
capital for american businesses and end the bias of the tax system 
toward debt financing by corporations 
at present companies pay dividends to shareholders out of 
aftertax profits and shareholders are also taxed on the dividends 
as well in the speech brady did not suggest how the government 
would make up the lost revenue from eliminating this double 
taxation an amount estimated to be as much as 40 billion a year 
brady also put in a plug for the administrations proposal to 
permanently reduce the capital gains tax which he said would 
provide an important incentive for companies to make longterm 
investments and he praised the administrationcongressional accord 
on cutting the budget deficit to 100 billion in the upcoming fiscal 
year 
he said all of these efforts would be needed to increase 
americas competitiveness

thousands of east germans crowded 
refugee camps tuesday to begin building new lives in the west after 
crossing the border from hungary officials said the emigre flood 
could exceed 15000 
about 11000 had arrived in west germany by tuesday night 
bavarian border officials said 
communist east germany issued a strong formal protest to 
hungarys reformminded government for permitting the exodus and 
demanded the movement be halted both east germany and hungary are 
warsaw pact nations 
most of the new east german emigres are skilled young workers and 
their families fed up with conditions in their hardline homeland 
many went straight to relatives already living in west germany 
others were being temporarily put up at refugee camps 
east germans who had camped outside the west german embassy in 
prague czechoslovakia also hoping to go west gave up after 
promises they would not be punished some had been there for weeks 
officials in hungary said thousands more east germans were 
arriving in that communist country which opened its doors to the 
west at midnight sunday when about 60000 east german vacationers 
were in hungary 
the officials suggested that the flow of refugees to the west had 
peaked saying the number of east german visitors was usual for this 
time of year 
hungarian officials sought to softpedal suggestions that most of 
the more than 50000 east germans reported on vacation in hungary 
could join others who had formally requested to leave for a new life 
in the west 
they said only 210 east germans registered overnight with 
authorities at a refugee camp in hungary coordinating the exodus 
westward 
hungary attracts tens of thousands of east german vacationers 
each year traditionally it has been relatively easy for most east 
germans to get permission to go there but far harder to get 
approval for visiting the west 
residents in the border city of passau greeted new arrivals with 
cheers hugs and offers of jobs and shelter tent camps and a 
reception area were set up for the emigres 
this reception is really amazing said ute kindl a refugee 
im really speechless over the warmness and kindness here 
a large banner outside the center bore the words herzlich 
willkommen heartfelt greetings red and silver helium balloons 
with the same message bobbed in the welcoming crowd bulletin boards 
listed jobs and apartments 
one east german man a 33yearold who only identified himself as 
dietrich said he had no idea where he wanted to settle but it 
will work out 
like many of the young emigres dietrich said he was fed up with 
the communist government and economic conditions back home 
labor minister gebhard glueck in the west german state of bavaria 
predicted that the total number of east germans seizing advantage of 
the chance to emigrate could top 15000 
east germanys state adn news agency released a government 
statement calling for immediate rescinding of hungarys decision 
to unilaterally suspend hungarianeast german agreements on 
border controls 
it said the protest was sent to the foreign ministry in budapest 
romania and czechoslovakia both warsaw pact states accused west 
germany on tuesday of trying to lure east germans to the west but 
offered only guarded criticism of their ally hungary 
the exodus began after hungary defied a 1969 agreement with east 
germany and opened its borders for thousands of east germans to 
settle in the west 
it comes at a time of dramatic change in the east bloc poland 
has installed its first government in four decades not led by 
communists and hungary is implementing political reforms 
the east germans arriving in private cars buses and trains 
were exhausted but jubilant over hungarys move 
well never be able to repay them for this said heinz 
schmidt who came from jena east germany 
the arrivals filled five temporary camps near the austrian border 
in bavaria officials were seeking more shelter areas in military 
barracks 
at a news conference in passau chief government spokesman hans 
klein criticized east germany for calling the exodus illegal and 
a provocation organized at high levels 
its stoneage verbiage that they have reacted with if there 
is a provocation its a provocation for freedom klein said 
klein said 8000 job offers for the refugees were received in 
passau alone 
in prague more than half of about 400 east germans gave up their 
vigil at the west german embassy leaving after east german 
authorities promised them they will not be punished if they returned 
home 
maj janos hornyak of the hungarian border guards told the 
associated press 6529 east germans arrived in hungary between 630 
am monday and 930 am tuesday he said 3220 east germans left 
for home over the same time via czechoslovakia which lies between 
hungary and east germany 
he said most entered from czechoslovakia the rest presumably 
vacationers on the bulgarian or romanian black sea coast came from 
romania he said he said the figures were normal for this time of 
year 
the soviet union sent a hardline politburo member yegor 
ligachev to east berlin adn did not state the purpose of the trip 
but it was presumed ligachev and east german officials would discuss 
hungarys role in the refugee affair

members of the penobscot indian tribe 
voted to remove tribal gov francis mitchell on tuesday in an 
unprecedented recall election 
the vote was 241206 according to a tribe official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity a date for an election to fill the vacancy 
would be set within 60 days by the tribal council the official said 
mitchell and lt gov philip guimond one of mitchells harshest 
critics have said they would run in the next election 
the recall climaxed a monthsold power struggle between mitchell 
and the 12member tribal council over past and future strategies for 
investing the penobscots share of the 815million indian 
landclaims settlement of 1980 
a majority of tribal members signed a petition in july demanding 
mitchells removal 
the petition includes allegations that mitchell has failed to 
comply with directives from the tribal council spent tribal funds 
and filled certain positions without authorization intimidated and 
harassed employees and taken actions that jeopardized a business 
owned by the tribe 
mitchell has said some people dislike his policies of fiscal 
austerity and that he has inherited about 7 million dollars of 
debt and an operating deficit that now exceeds 1 million which he 
cites as evidence of past mismanagement 
other tribal leaders maintain that there was an operating surplus 
when mitchell took over and that outside audits of tribal finances 
have turned up no evidence of any wrongdoing

three federal agencies are denouncing an 
environmental groups campaign against the use of pesticides on 
food saying it pressures grocers to make regulatory decisions 
better left to the government 
the effort by the national toxics campaign appears to attempt 
to put the onus for pesticide regulation inappropriately on the us 
grocery industry said a joint statement by the environmental 
protection agency the food and drug administration and the 
agriculture department 
the bostonbased environmental group on monday announced 
agreement with a small number of grocery chains to sign a pledge 
designed to reduce pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables 
however the federal agencies said the government seeks to 
balance the benefits and risks of pesticides and accused the 
environmentalists of ignoring the fact that pesticides rid food 
products of diseases that could pose serious health concerns

wildlife on federal preserves is being harmed 
by human activities ranging from military dogfight practice to 
waterskiers congressional investigators reported today 
interior department managers know that secondary uses of refuges 
are causing direct harm to wildlife general accounting office

kevin mcclain was dirty sullen withdrawn on 
drugs and about to be fired when he broke into a police car to steal 
guns the judge gave him a choice five years in a cell or a few 
months in boot camp 
mcclain chose regimented days of classes drills humiliation and 
abuse 
he went in strictly as a little old teenage wild boy he came 
out as a disciplined young man said his grandfather george ottis 
hinton 
all he studies now is work said his grandmother lestereen 
hinton and hes always hugging on us and telling us i love 
you 
i feel like im alive now said mcclain of shreveport one 
of 618 men and women sent to the shock incarceration program at hunt 
correctional center since it opened 2 years ago and one of 296 
graduates 
eleven states have such programs aimed at behavior modification 
instead of just punishment and a dozen are considering them 
president bush proposed boot camps as part of his antidrug plan 
the us justice department next year will issue the first national 
review of shock incarceration said doris mckenzie a louisiana 
state university researcher working on the study 
the report will cover seven of the 11 states georgia and 
oklahoma which have the nations two oldest prison boot camps both 
opened in late 1983 new york and texas which focus on drug users 
and sellers louisiana florida and south carolina alabama 
mississippi arizona and michigan also have programs but a study of 
all 11 would have been too expensive said mckenzie 
the seven were chosen for differences in the inmates accepted 
whether they are assigned by judges or corrections officials 
whether they may drop out if counseling is a major part of the 
program how much supervision inmates get on parole and how many 
hours a day the program lasts 
louisiana will issue a report on its program next month but 
officials say they are encouraged by graduates like the 20yearold 
mcclain 
compared to regular parole where theres 70 to 80 percent 
failure its doing real well said shreveport parole agent louis 
stacks 
the program known officially as the intensive motivational 
program of alternative correctional treatment involves intensive 
followup at least four meetings a week with the parole officer 
curfew checks fulltime school or work community service and 
random drug and alcohol tests 
even where impact appears only to increase parole agents work 
those in charge say its worth continuing it has its problems 
but if the problems are ironed out as i guess the department is 
trying to do eventually it might be a very successful program 
said supervisor sherman butler 
state officials say shock incarceration also saves money they 
estimate that mcclains training and parole supervision cost about 
3400 compared to an average cost of 9100 a year for inmates in 
regular prison 
and the number of people who make it through parole is 
encouraging said corrections department spokeswoman martha 
jumonville 
more than half of those who entered boot camp either dropped out 
or were kicked out of 283 men and 13 women who made it through in 
the programs first 17 months 70 were sent back to prison for 
violating parole that 236 percent recidivism rate compares to 29 
percent for inmates paroled after serving onethird or more of their 
sentences and a 36 percent rate for those released early because of 
credit earned for good behavior in prison 
most of the impact parolees were caught drinking using drugs or 
violating curfew rather than committing new crimes the reason 
most other parolees are returned to prison however many of the 296 
impact parolees had been out only a few months much too short a 
time to say whether they would make it 
by and large we find we dont have any problem for the first 
month or two said kenneth temple one of two parole officers who 
deal with impact cases in new orleans its like babies theyre 
really cute for the first few months the real proof of the 
pudding is in four five or six months 
some fail even after making it through the period of heavy 
supervision that is designed to help impact parolees adjust to the 
outside world 
dennis daniels for example had graduated to regular parole 
before he was arrested on charges of burglary and drug possession 
he escaped from jail and was caught in salt lake city 
stacks said daniels fell apart after he lost his job at a funeral 
home in cutbacks attributed to the states failing economy but 
you know counting the time he was in impact that was two years he 
wasnt committing any new crimes all this going downhill it 
took maybe a week two weeks 
mcclain said he was using methedrine lsd valium and booze when 
he was arrested he stole money for drugs and because it was what 
his friends did he bathed reluctantly once a week i just 
didnt care i felt very low 
now hes not only working full time at county market where he 
was a parttime janitor before his arrest but hes won a promotion 
hes outgoing talks to people gets along with people real 
well he does a great job respects his superiors he gets here 30 
minutes before work said gary creel store director at the 
supermarket 
mcclain said he hadnt expected to be offered an apprenticeship 
in the meat department but knows why he deserved it id run to 
get stuff run here run there the rest of the maintenance guys 
were just walking and moping along 
i was just so full of energy from the impact it hasnt worn 
off

a halfcentury ago federal officials 
made their first pitch to add to the national park system the bright 
red buildings of this abandoned copper mill camp the countrys 
largest ghost town 
several decades and proposals later the idea is alive again 
appraisers have finished poking through 40 or so structures built 
in 1906 for kennecott mines co and a contract will be awarded soon 
to put a cost on removing any asbestos and industrial chemicals left 
behind said dick martin superintendent of wrangell st elias 
national park and preserve which surrounds the frontier mining town 
and its adjacent glacier 
the deal would include about 3000 acres plus buildings 
kennecott copper corp has to donate the subsurface rights martin 
said on a recent tour of the decaying yet sound 14story 
concentration mill and leeching plant 
the figures go anywhere from zero to 4or5 million dollars 
but those are shots at the moon until an appraisal is done and a 
cost of dealing with hazardous materials is known no one is doing 
much of anything 
the national park service hopes to know the costs by october or 
november he said well pass that along to headquarters either 
with a recommendation for acquisition or that its beyond our 
abilities or financial constraints 
the first proposal to fold the privately owned historic mining 
town into the national park system was made in 1938 martin said 
it came up again in the 40s and i believe it was discussed again 
in the 50s there were various proposals like using the tramways 
for ski areas and the dormitories for hotels but nothing has 
happened 
i guess im a little more optimistic that something will be 
done soon because of the appraisals 
kennecott mines co took its name from kennicott glacier in 1906 
but the company which still operates in utah misspelled the name 
its 800 workers may be gone but many of their books and papers 
still lie on desks and most of the machinery remains that they used 
to crush and extract ore from one of the richest copper deposits 
ever known 
from 1911 to 1935 the kennecott deposit about 235 miles east of 
anchorage produced 46 million tons of ore that was refined into 
591535 tons of copper and 9 million ounces of silver worth some 
300 million 
the discovery of vast copper deposits in chile and economic 
dislocations brought by the great depression killed kennecott even 
though millions of tons of highgrade ore may still lie within 
bonanza ridge which rises several thousand feet behind the 
processing facilities 
but its history that makes the site so valuable martin said 
theres always going to be some great value here for the public 
even if some of these buildings fall down the more that are 
standing the better clearly but there always will be a great deal 
of value because of the people who lived here the scenic value and 
what they did here 
with help from volunteers he said it might be possible to make 
the area safe for visitors to roam outside the buildings but it 
would be simply beyond our ability to pay for restoring all the 
buildings to safe condition we may fix up one of the buildings 
for visitor contact or interpretation 
only a few tourists now walk or ski the trails leading to mines 
with names like bonanza mother lode and jumbo people either fly to 
the 4000foot gravel airstrip at mccarthy five miles down a rutted 
road or they drive scenic edgerton highway to its terminus at the 
kennicott river then pull themselves handoverhand on a cable tram 
that separates the road from the wilderness 
at 132 million acres wrangellst elias national park and 
preserve is the nations largest national park it abounds in 
wildlife dall sheep buffalo caribou moose wolves brown and 
black bear among others it also includes nine of the 16 highest 
mountains in the united states mount wrangell is an active volcano 
with steam and the odor of sulfur wafting near its summit 
miners still extract gold and silver from more than 900 active 
claims within the park which is six times the size of yellowstone 
but because of its remoteness has fewer visitors in a year than 
yellowstone on a summer weekend 
more than a million acres within the park are privately owned 
several of the buildings and the kennicott glacier lodge would not 
be part of the ghost town buyout martin said 
if its acquired we would like to work with other landowners 
on public access and architectural designs and types he said 
thats not to get public access across properties but to set up 
some definitions of what would be open and what would be 
offlimits

given tvs penchant for docudramatizing 
everything but the making of a docudrama it was inevitable that the 
fatal crash of a delta air lines jumbo jet in l985 would become a 
factbased tv movie 
strange thing though theres a superior example of the breed 
tonight in fire and rain the usa networks madeforcable 
version of that stormyday tragedy as the big jet approached the 
dallas airport the crash killed 136 people on the jet and a 
motorist on the ground 
a fair number of docudramas tend to be excessively dramatic full 
of screams distortions on behalf of dramatic truth hokey 
dialogue loud hypethestory music and even bad acting 
but the twohour fire and rain is pretty much the opposite a 
thoughtful surprisingly restrained drama by gary sherman that 
covers a lot in two hours with only a few clinkers and with a 
generally solid cast 
sensitively directed by jerry jameson and filmed in dallas its 
emphasis is not so much on the whys of the crash as its aftermath 
the accidents traumatic effects on survivors the families of the 
dead and injured and even two volunteer emergency medical workers 
wellplayed here by charles haid and dean jones who do what they 
can to help after the tragedy 
guilt compassion anger anguish and helplessness the whole 
emotional range is nicely stitched together with some scenes that 
linger in the memory like jones near tears as he quietly puts a 
mudspattered dead child into a black rubber body bag one of many 
such bags lying on raindamp concrete outside an airport hangar 
during the films two hours a cliche occasionally escapes and 
it did not seem a wise idea to bring angie dickinson david 
hasselhoff and pop singer patti labelle to the proceedings 
dickinson in a mediumsize role and the other two in small ones 
they add naught to the night 
true the movie is billed somewhat erroneously as having an 
allstar cast but fire and rain a good show would have 
been even better had those in charge simply cast good actors in all 
parts as was the case in nbcs roe vs wade last season 
but its a minor gripe the majority of players here are good 
particularly susan ruttan as a mother of four kids a housewife 
whose husband is killed in the crash 
the docudrama will be followed tonight by a halfhour discussion 
led by former abc anchor steve bell on coping with the traumas that 
result from largescale tragedies such as the delta crash 
one of the three guests on the followup show robert m katz has 
a firsthand perspective he survived the crash along with his wife 
debbie he suffered minor injuries but she was seriously injured 
hospitalized for five months and still suffers from the injuries of 
1985 
their story they have four children and live in coral springs 
fla wasnt told as part of fire and rain katz wasnt asked 
what he thought of the movie during taping of the followup program 
however in an interview afterward he said he was surprised that 
the film wasnt as sensationalized as some of the other movies 
ive seen about some of the other plane crashes and disasters in 
this case it was almost an understatement 
katz a stockbroker said he hadnt closely paid attention to the 
movie when he saw the cassette of it that usa network had sent him 
for viewing prior to its cable premiere tonight but parts of the 
film werent accurate he said emphasizing that he wasnt knocking 
the movie 
he cited a scene just before the delta jumbo jet crashes one 
that showed passengers yelling screaming and crying i didnt see 
that there actually was a really deadly silence the whole flight 
in my memory was a pretty eerie affair

a punchline can help the bottom line says a 
new kind of consultant who counsels executives and office staffers 
on how to lighten up the work place 
some companies in the 1980s have turned to humor consultants to 
help their workers relax get along better and produce more less 
tension means lower insurance and health care costs and less 
absenteeism these consultants argue 
humor makes the job more enjoyable and in effect if most of us 
work because we absolutely have to work were in rough shape 
said warren b griffin professor of industrial psychology at 
monmouth college 
griffin said he has stressed the importance of appreciating the 
funny during corporate consulting he has done over the years he 
uses role playing to help employees understand the value of a 
joke 
however it is not so much telling a joke milton berlestyle 
but pointing out the ridiculousness of something that happens in the 
process of what youre doing he said thats basically not too 
hard to find 
a number of humor consultants interviewed agreed that the goal is 
for employees to take themselves less seriously while staying 
serious about their jobs 
the beginning of humor is a willingness to acknowledge the 
self said edward c ryterband a former professional standup 
comicturnedconsultant he is a partner in landyryterband amp 
associates of shrewsbury nj 
the number of humor consultants is difficult to estimate dr 
steve allen jr a horseheads ny physician who spends about 25 
percent of his time speaking to companies and organizations on 
humor puts the number at about a dozen 
companies searching for ways to propagate the corporate harmony 
of japan are encouraging humor as a powerful coping mechanism and 
as a corporate strategy said allen son of the comedian steve 
allen 
in broader terms the trend is part of a cultural wind blowing 
that people are interested in looking at their lifestyle said 
joel goodman who calls himself a humor educator 
goodman says he has addressed more than 200000 people worldwide 
at companies conventions and seminars through his humor project 
based in saratoga springs ny 
he said his corporate clients have included ibm raytheon co and 
monsanto corp 
allen said he teaches participants to juggle scarves both as a 
3yearold thing to do and as a model for laughing at oneself 
celebrating a skill and developing a positive attitude 
the consultants interviewed said they knew of little hard data 
that proved their work had a tangible effect 
goodman cited the 600 to 700 letters a week he receives asking 
for information or praising his work allen says research in israel 
has shown a link between comedy and better performance on creativity 
tests 
others point to physiological studies on how laughter may produce 
endorphins biologically created painkillers in the brain 
susan little an accounting manager at u s west communications in 
seattle said goodmans presentation helped lift morale at the 
company a year after the 1984 breakup of atampt when stress was 
mounting in the telecommunications world 
anything we could do for our managers to help reduce that 
stress so they could be more more productive was what we were 
looking for she said

when it was published in 1986 frank perettis 
novel about spiritual battles was a sleeper even on christian 
bookstore shelves this present darkness now is so popular that 
generaltrade book stores are ordering it by the thousands 
perettis sequel piercing the darkness had 400000 preprint 
orders before its release last month far more advance interest than 
betterknown christian authors like chuck swindoll and james dobson 
receive 
a breezy writing style lots of dialogue and battles between 
goldenhaired winged swordwielding angels and slimy 
sulfurbreathing taloned demons make this present darkness a 
gripping read 
written from a christian viewpoint the battle for human souls 
takes place against the backdrop of the attempted takeover of a 
small college town by occult forces 
the book sold 4200 copies in its first year of release then 
someone sent a copy to christian singer amy grant who enjoys 
unparalleled popularity among nonchristians in the pop music genre 
at her soldout concerts grant told audiences the books message 
of the power of prayer had a profound influence on her sales began 
to take off 
by this month this present dakness had sold 625000 copies 
and was in its 20th printing it has been the no 1selling 
paperback in bookstore journal the trade publication of the 
3000member christian bookstores of america for 10 of the last 12 
months coming in second the other two months 
when piercing the darkness was released aug 11 a blocklong 
line of customers waited outside a store in nashville tenn 
zondervan corps 93 family book stores sold their initial order of 
2000 copies in advance 
the word about the first book still is spreading to generaltrade 
bookstores at the tattered cover in denver religious and 
philosophy book buyer matt cowles said the store has been selling 15 
to 20 copies a month the store stocks about 125000 titles and is 
among the largest independent bookstores in the country 
it certainly caught us off guard cowles said we kept 
thinking it was going to slow down but its done very well for us 
and id say it appeals to the general market 
retail book chains b dalton and waldenbooks have ordered several 
thousand copies of this present darkness crossway books 
publicist kathy jacobs said crossway which published both books 
is a division of good news publishers in westchester ill 
ed morrow president of the american booksellers association and 
a shop owner in manchester center vt said the question of how a 
christian book makes the transition to general trade sales often is 
discussed 
the christian book market is so large the books often just 
dont sell in a generaltrade store morrow said there is some 
transference but a lot of times its not visible because we dont 
know the titles 
with 800000 titles in print and 50000 new titles a month 
keeping track would be a formidable task morrow had not heard of 
this present darkness 
jan dennis editor in chief at crossway said he thinks peretti 
struck a chord among christian fundamentalists whose beliefs clash 
with such new age ideas as channeling and spirit guides 
he has written a book for the socalled moral majority they 
can hold this up and say this is how i see the world dennis 
said it operates out of a traditional christian mythos and that 
makes it appealing to the traditional christian reader 
there are 35 or 40 million people in this country who are 
really upset with the way things are for once their side is not 
beaten down they win dennis said 
as a writer peretti has been compared to horror master stephen 
king and his works with the fictional christian tales of cs lewis 
peretti said hes never read king he said he thinks among 
christian readers his books meet a spiritual need the first book 
has been translated into eight languages 
i have gotten some feedback from nonbelievers some of whom 
have been enamored by the new age or occultism he said some 
have abandoned that direction and realized it is a danger better 
avoided 
peretti appreciates grants support 
i had quite a boost from her but i hesitate to praise any one 
person too much i have a real strong conviction that this is more 
of the lords doing than any particular individual he said from 
his seattlearea home 
negotiations are under way for movie rights to this present 
darkness with howard kazanjian producer of raiders of the lost 
ark completion of such a project is at least four years away 
peretti said

the old testament may be that to most 
christians but it is certainly not that to jews whose forebears 
produced it 
the secondary rating implied in the christian designation is one 
of the interreligious scars handed down through the centuries but 
it and other linguistic sore spots are being examined for the 
possibility of better names 
its a much discussed subject said phyllis trible a bible 
scholar at new yorks union theological seminary when christians 
say old testament that implies its outofdate inferior that 
offends jews 
the church is searching for some alternative 
several are being explored and some increasingly are being used 
for example hebrew bible is becoming popular in academic 
circles though that is not what jews call it 
early in christian history the church gave the designation old 
testament to the scriptures preceding jesus a jew writings about 
him also by jews were called the new testament 
christians accept both compilations as inspired by god jews 
accept only the older scriptures what they themselves call the 
tanek an acronym for the torah law nebiim prophets and 
kethubim writings 
finding proper language for christians to use in referring to 
judaism generally is an ageold problem the catholic messenger 
diocesan weekly of davenport iowa said in an editorial 
the traditional old and new testament usage implies that 
the jewish scriptures are not only old in terms of time but 
outmoded no longer relevant except as a precursor of the 
revelation of jesus christ the paper said 
rabbi burton visotzky of the jewish theological seminary of 
america said the use of old testament is not going to blow us out 
of the water but it is bad etiquette inappropriate 
we dont like it he added we dont think its the old 
testament we think its our bible but things are changing little 
by little a very large number of christians now call it the hebrew 
bible 
in interviews he and ms trible said that the change so far is 
largely in the academic environment but that it also is spreading 
to congregations and modifying their usage 
its moving out among the people ms trible said 
attributing the reassessment to closer jewishchristian 
relationships and understanding resulting from dialogues 
however biblical designations are not the only touchy linguistic 
zone another is the western worlds dating of events bc before 
christ and ad anno domini year of our lord 
this christian designation of time is something involving all 
society as well as religion ms trible said we call it 
christian chauvinism in an increasingly pluralistic world 
chauvinism is unacceptable 
the adbc issue lately has badgered the biblical archeology 
review a washingtonbased bimonthly whose letters columns have been 
packed with arguments over continuing that usage or substituting 
ce current era and bce before current era 
we get complaints if we do it one way and complaints if we do 
it the other said editor hershel shanks were not 
denominational jewish or christian and weve decided to allow our 
authors to choose whichever designation they prefer 
he said most now choose the bce and ce designations as 
religiously neutral 
visotzky said many scholarly religious journals such as the 
journal of biblical literature and harvard theological review now 
use ce and bce 
its a sign of the increased influence of ecumenism he said 
people have become sensitive through dialogue to both the jewish 
and christian roles 
ms trible pointed out that the term old testament is never used 
in the bible itself new testament passages refer to the earlier 
scriptures as the law and the prophets 
however references by the prophet jeremiah and by jesus to god 
making a new covenant with people prompted church designations 
of old and new testaments 
various substitutes have been considered for old testament but 
ms trible noted drawbacks to each 
calling it jewish bible would be inadequate since christians 
consider it part of their bible the use of tanek the jewish 
acronym is hampered by christian unfamiliarity with it 
bible scholar james sanders of the claremont calif school of 
theology advocates first testament and second testament but 
using first would imply the second which is not accepted by 
jews 
as for hebrew bible ms trible noted it is unclear whether 
hebrew refers to language or people if people that would exclude 
most christians who also claim the book and if langauge then it 
is not quite accurate since bits are not in hebrew but aramaic 
there is a problem with all of it she said 
but hebrew bible seems the increasingly chosen solution among 
scholars visotzky said the book is overwhelmingly in hebrew except 
minor instances 
as for the new testament visotzky said jews intriguingly 
have no objections to that title they even use it

silver suggested in a letter to bush that the president 
indicate you are going to fly to teheran and personally discuss 
the situation with the leaders of iran 
such a dramatic act would it seems to me evoke a favorable

after 9 months as prime minister 
benazir bhutto sees herself as a crusader to save pakistan from the 
clutches of drugs ethnic violence and rancorous politics 
i see things in terms of knights in shining armor trying to 
root out evil ms bhutto said in an interview with the associated 
press 
that may be a sort of simplistic way to put it but i am an 
optimist i have great dreams for my country and i want to achieve 
them 
but she acknowledged her vision might be a bit fanciful 
i think i am too much of an idealist 
educated at harvard and englands oxford university the 
36yearold ms bhutto is the first woman to lead a moslem nation 
and as she spoke she had a scarf called a dupatta draped over 
her shoulder when in public she wears the scarf over her head the 
custom of moslem women as a concession to pakistans religious 
right wing a powerful minority that opposes female rule 
ms bhutto and her leftleaning pakistan peoples party govern a 
restless nation of 107 million people burdened by poverty 
illiteracy and civil war across the border in afghanistan 
she said death threats after her government declared war on the 
heroin trade and drug barons have forced her to think of her safety 
something she has resisted since assuming office dec 2 
i dont believe in a life that is crowded with security she 
said i think its kind of nice to be able to slip away after 
having worked hard for a few days to be able to go for a half an 
hour walk 
i just consider it important for a person in public life to try 
and maintain a sense of normalacy to have their feet on the 
ground 
as for the drug war she said we are really now just going 
after the big people but its a much bigger problem its just 
proliferated all over the country like a cancer 
western countries estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin 
arriving in the united states and europe comes from pakistan drug 
addiction in pakistan has soared from near zero in 1979 to an 
estimated 1 million addicts in 1989 
ms bhutto is also doing battle with an opposition made up of 
islamic fundamentalists conservatives and loyalists of the late 
president gen mohammad zia ulhaq and his military government 
zia overthrew her father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in 
a 1977 coup and had him hanged two years later for his alleged 
complicity in a murder plot 
zia many of his top generals and us ambassador arnold l 
raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in august 1988 clearing the 
way for pakistans first free elections in more than a decade and 
resulting in mrs bhuttos election nov 16 
ms bhutto says the most serious threat to her government is 
ethnic hundreds of pakistanis have died and thousands have been 
injured since 1986 in violence in her southern home province of 
sindh in fighting among militant secessionists indian moslem 
immigrants and internal migrants from poorer provinces 
during general zias time ethnic groups became very strong 
she said they set up armed camps and they trained their people 
so its a situation of almost a minikind of a guerrilla war its 
not a guerrilla war against the government but its almost a state 
of anarchy and a rebellion against authority 
ms bhutto claims that her rightwing political opposition the 
nineparty islamic democratic alliance has had a hand in the sindh 
violence 
she also has implicated neighboring india in the sindh troubles 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since they became 
independent from britain in 1947 and they routinely accuse each 
other of fueling their internal problems 
to the west ms bhutto inherited pakistans sponsorship of 
moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the sovietbacked government of 
afghanistan 
more than 3 million afghan war refugees huddle in camps dotting 
pakistans western frontier 
pakistan cant afford to keep the refugees she said but 
are the refugees going to go back without political stability 
so far we have not seen any message or any method that would 
enable the emergence of an independent afghanistan or the return of 
the afghan refugees those remain our goals 
she also said her political opposition is doomed because of its 
links to the zia era when pakistan was under martial law and 
political parties were barred from elections 
pakistan just cant afford a return to the decade of 
repression she said all those who are patriots in the 
different sectors of life whether it is civilian or military 
recognize that therefore i see no imminent threat to democracy in 
pakistan 
but she added that law and order cannot survive without economic 
development in a country where the average yearly wage is under 400 
first youve got to try and create a system create a rule of 
law which gives security and side by side youve got to have 
economic improvement and opportunitiees so people can give better 
meaning to their lives she said

vietnams military retreat from 
cambodia should hasten the decline in soviet influence in indochina 
and possibly open the door to the west for the first time since 
1975 diplomats in phnom penh say 
vietnams promised pullout of its last 26000 soldiers by sept 
26 will meet part of the price the noncommunist world has long 
demanded for normal ties with indochina vietnam cambodia and laos 
the vietnamese pullout will not meet two key western demands 
that the withdrawal be internationally monitored and that it be part 
of an overall political settlement of the conflict among cambodian 
factions 
diplomats said they expect to see gradual increases in private 
and lowerlevel official contacts and commercial dealings that 
vietnam and cambodia desperately seek with the west 
all around phnom penh are signs that cambodians are looking to a 
future with the west 
english has become the most popular foreign language and an 
entire block is lined with bamboo huts housing englishlanguage 
schools signs that many cambodians foresee a return of the 
americans who roamed their streets during the indochina war 
vietnam and cambodia committed themselves to increased ties with 
the noncommunist world a few years ago when amid economic crises 
they embarked on reforms requiring western trade investment and 
aid they had relied on largely ineffective east bloc aid only 
because the west gave them no other choice said the diplomats who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
everyone that wants to come to do business here they are all 
welcome vice prime minister kong samol said in an interview 
in cambodia the opening to the west also is a political 
necessity 
when we speak about the future of this country we have to 
understand one thing that prime minister hun sen and his people 
must change the government to a more capitalistic one because that 
is the only way to be accepted by the international community 
said a frank east bloc diplomat 
phnom penh has been much less committed than the vietnamese 
government in hanoi to socialist doctrine and cambodia could rapidly 
move into the western camp if prince norodom sihanouk the former 
leader who now heads an antigovernment faction returned to a 
position of authority in a political settlement 
the vietnamese are probably fearful that the west would with 
its guilty conscience put everything into cambodia but still 
isolate vietnam said a western aid official 
the strategic value of vietnam and cambodia has declined for the 
soviet union as it recently improved relations with china and no 
longer needs ways to balance its influence in asia but the 
diplomats said cambodia also has become too expensive for president 
mikhail s gorbachevs kremlin 
at the same time they added vietnam and cambodia realized that 
their national security required more balanced relations with the 
superpowers and the association of southeast asian nations the 
areas noncommunist grouping 
vietnam has been moscows closest ally in asia since communist 
forces defeated usbacked indochinese governments in 1975 with 
the prime exception of the united states most western nations 
recognized the new government in hanoi but they imposed economic 
blockades after vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and 
installed a provietnamese communist government 
cambodia has been cut off from the west since the communist khmer 
rouge defeated the usbacked lon nol government in 1975 and 
slaughtered citizens by the hundreds of thousands vietnams 
invasion drove the khmer rouge to the jungles from which they still 
wage a guerrilla war with other antigovernment factions 
in 1987 official cambodian media said the soviet union was 
giving the country 625 million in economic aid for five projects 
for the period 198690 a soviet official said in 1986 that moscow 
was giving 123 billion to 139 billion to vietnam for the same 
period 
moscows most prominent military presence in indochina is at 
vietnams cam ranh bay the former us base that is now considered 
the largest overseas soviet naval base but vietnam said last year 
it may allow other countries to use the base 
an east bloc diplomat said the soviets have withdrawn 60 percent 
of their personnel from cambodia in the past year leaving about 
1000 he said many of those who left were technical experts who 
worked without any result and the soviets decided the resources 
could be better used to resolve their own problems 
for similar reasons moscow also will slash economic aid to 
vietnam it reportedly also has been unhappy with hanois slow 
retreat from cambodia 
the soviets are not very popular said a western ambassador 
in hanoi they dont mix well with the population they failed 
completely to get their confidence many foreigners have married 
vietnamese girls but that is unthinkable for a russian 
cambodia and vietnam were not happy with the soviets limited 
commitment to their development and what they saw as unfair terms of 
aid and trade 
diplomats said some countries including thailand and australia 
may recognize the cambodian government after the vietnamese leave if 
it holds open elections and holds off the guerrillas 
australia was one of the first countries to mediate the cambodian 
issue and has given much aid to cambodia through the united nations 
and nongovernmental organizations 
good relations with phnom penh are crucial to neighboring 
thailands security the government there has said it hopes to see 
indochina change from battlefields to marketplaces

a religious group that has sponsored boycotts of 
tv programs it considers offensive has picked a new target a doll 
modeled after the ghoulish movie character freddy krueger 
the american family association which once claimed cartoon 
character mighty mouse appeared to have snorted cocaine in a tv 
show said monday the krueger doll was the product of a sick 
mind 
the tupelo missbased group also urged a boycott of stores that 
stock the doll and a boycott of all other toys made by matchbox toys 
usa ltd 
the talking doll is based on the fiend from the nightmare on 
elm street movies matchbox announced last week the doll would be 
available for halloween sales 
the doll has a string that when pulled causes it to spout such 
phrases as pleasant dreams watch out freddys back or the 
characters trademark diabolical laugh 
this doll is the product of a sick mind the fact that a major 
toy manufacturer would promote this doll is tragic said the rev 
donald e wildmon executive director of the group and a united 
methodist minister 
the american family association formerly known as the national 
federation for decency has advocated numerous boycotts in the past 
earlier this year it protested pepsico incs use of rock star 
madonna in television commercials for pepsicola because of her 
performance in a separate video for her song like a prayer that 
showed a burning cross and other images that offended some 
christians 
pepsi in april withdrew its tv commercial featuring madonna 
saying consumers were confusing the music video with its ad which 
contained no religious imagery 
american family association also has urged boycotts of companies 
that advertise on nbcs saturday night live program which the 
group considers offensive 
last year cbs cut 3 seconds from an episode of mighty mouse 
after wildmon said the scene gave the impression that the cartoon 
hero was snorting cocaine cbs said he was sniffing flowers 
allen wildmon associate director of the group and donald 
wildmons brother said the group is asking supporters to contact 
their local stores and encourage them to refuse to carry the freddy 
krueger doll 
we hope to keep this doll from being marketed he said 
the american family association journal claims a circulation of 
about 380000 including nearly 180000 churches and pastors 
freddy krueger the main character in the five nightmare on elm 
street horror films takes revenge on residents of a town by 
murdering teenagers the latest sequel a nightmare on elm street 
5 the dream child was released this summer 
the film character who has long bladelike fingernails has 
developed a cult following and has generated an estimated 300 
million in domestic and foreign box office receipts and 
videocassette sales 
a spokeswoman for matchbox toys said no one at the company was 
immediately available to comment on american family associatons 
charges matchbox a maker of small toy cars also markets a 
talking peewee herman doll

quaker oats co embroiled in an oat bran 
dispute with texas officials wants industrywide guidelines that 
would allow food companies to advertise product health claims 
without prior government approval 
health benefit claims on packages and in advertising would have 
to be substantiated scientifically said luther c mckinney the top 
legal officer for chicagobased quaker 
the claims could be reviewed on a casebycase basis by the 
federal food and drug administration he said monday 
mckinneys proposal came during an address to the food and drug 
law institute seminar in which he also critcized the texas lawsuit 
over quakers oatmeal advertising 
the texas state attorney general does not want us to 
communicate health messages to the citizens of his state said 
mckinney 
a spokesman for the texas attorney general who was familiar with 
the lawsuit could not be reached for comment monday evening 
last thursday texas attorney general jim mattox alleged in a 
lawsuit filed in austin that quaker ads claiming its oatmeal can 
reduce cholesterol and in turn lessen the risk of heart attack are 
replete with exaggerations halftruths and misinformation 
let me state unequivocally that we dispute his allegations our 
advertising for our oat products is truthful and is supported by 
valid reliable scientific evidence said mckinney 
mckinney said the lawsuit does a disservice to consumers 
because it would prevent us from articulating a very important 
reason why consumers should eat oats 
he conceded that oat bran health claims were very important 
to the sales of oatmeal and other oat cereals if were going to 
compete in this very tough environment 
in addition mckinney accused competitor kellogg co of 
marketing by inference because the battle creek mich cereal 
maker has said it will not make health claims only health messages 
about its new high fiber cereal heartwise 
the dispute over heartwise involves its use of psyllium a grain 
from india that is high in soluble fiber soluble fiber has been 
linked to reduced blood cholesterol levels 
psyllium is about 80 percent soluble fiber compared to oat brans 
10 percent 
general mills inc also is promoting a cereal containing 
psyllium called benefit its ads for the product make outright 
claims about cholesterol reduction 
but critics say psyllium an ingedient in some laxatives should 
be considered a drug and not included in food products without fda 
approval 
i can understand mr mckinneys concern here in that pysllium 
is a natural grain that has ten times the soluble fiber as oat bran 
and thats the issue joseph m stewart a kellogg senior vice 
president said in a telephone interview 
mckinney reserved most of his criticism for mattox however 
saying those supporting a ban on public health claims for food are 
essentially advocating consumer ignorance 
noting that more than 60 million people in the united states have 
cholesterol levels above the recommended level mckinney asked 
where should they get such information from a library from a 
health magazine thats an elitist solution to the problem if you 
ask me 
in one ad quaker states that in recent clinical studies where 
oats were a daily part of a lowfat lowcholesterol diet total 
serum cholesterol levels dropped an average almost 10 percent other 
medical studies show such a drop could reduce your risk of heart 
attack by nearly 20 percent 
but texas claims quakers own tests showed that only a 3 percent 
reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a 
lowfat lowcholesterol diet and that reduction is applicable only 
to women who eat 25 percent more oatmeal than quaker recommends as a 
regular serving 
quaker maintains its ads have been backed up by scientific 
studies and cleared after an investigation by the federal trade 
commission 
following complaints about quakers ads from a washingtonbased 
consumer rights group the ftc investigated for a year and 
concluded that our ads were not misleading said mckinney

more than onethird of the record 673 million in 
fines and penalties being paid by drexel burnham lambert inc to 
resolve federal securities law violations will be used in the 
governments war on drugs 
attempting to boost president bushs new 79 billion drug 
package the justice department decided to allocate the lions share 
of drexels criminal penalty to a fund that will be overseen by drug 
czar william j bennett 
drexel pleaded guilty monday to six felonies and began paying 
650 million plus interest and civil insider trading penalties 
closing a major chapter in the 3yearold wall street corruption 
crackdown 
the new york investment firm immediately wrote certified checks 
to three government agencies and a bank that will manage a fund 
earmarked for civil damages claims against drexel 
a check for 78 million the fine against drexel calculated 
under federal law was sent to the us postal service and will be 
used in part for whitecollar criminal probes by that agency us 
attorney benito romano said 
the remaining 22219677097 criminal penalty was sent to the 
us marshals service asset forfeiture fund which romano said comes 
under bennetts discretion starting oct 1 
the fund currently is used for prison construction and other 
immediate law enforcement needs next month it switches exclusively 
to the war on drugs 
clearly the department of justice wanted to see the drexel 
criminal fine help fund the law enforcement efforts including the 
war on narcotics said assistant us attorney alan cohen who 
heads the offices securities fraud unit 
government officials said the fund now has about 250 million and 
will nearly double thanks to the drexel penalty 
the total fines and penalties against drexel amounted to 
67323726028 all but 150 million of that was paid monday 
drexels longawaited plea followed months of legal wrangling 
over charges based largely on information from ivan boesky the 
imprisoned stock speculator whose revelations about systematic 
lawbreaking have stunned the financial world since his arrest nearly 
three years ago 
this terminates our investigation of drexel as an entity 
romano said at a news conference obviously their cooperation will 
lead us in other directions wherever those leads take us we will 
go 
drexel attorney thomas f curnin entered the guilty plea before 
us district judge kimba m wood in manhattan federal court 
the plea had been expected since drexel and the government 
reached an agreement on the charges in january but was delayed by 
challenges brought by michael milken drexels former chief junk 
bond trader who was indicted separately in march 
the plea triggered enactment of a separate settlement between 
drexel and the securities and exchange commission reached in april 
that places drexel under unprecedented government supervision for 
three years and revamps its management 
while it is for us a highly sobering event we are determined 
to make drexel a model of how a securities firm ought to conduct its 
business in the 90s and to focus new energies and resources on the 
opportunities which lie ahead of us drexel said in a statement 
drexel pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud and two 
counts of mail fraud and agreed to pay the fines and penalties for 
illegal stock transactions involving the firm and milken boesky and 
the defunct princetonnewport partners lp 
boesky has given the government information for several 
securities fraud prosecutions including the conviction of five 
princetonnewport officials and former drexel trader bruce newberg 
earlier this year and the fraud and racketeering indictment of 
milken his brother lowell and newberg 
drexel before had never publicly admitted to the crimes and 
joseph told employees earlier this year the firm agreed to plead 
guilty because it feared a racketeering indictment that could have 
forced drexel out of business 
romano said the government was satisfied with the plea 
so long as its not understood as undermining this admission of 
guilty then whatever they say to their employees is entirely up 
to them he said 
under the agreemement drexel paid 300 million in criminal fines 
and penalties plus 855 percent interest and set aside 200 
million of a total of 350 million in the civil fund the remaining 
150 million is to be paid over the next three years 
drexel also paid 1515 million plus interest to the sec for 
penalties under the federal insider trading sanctions act

the monopoly character is a lighthearted portrayal of the 
successful business people who are our target market 
pan am launched its corporate jet ads last last february in

a new university of pennsylvania study paints 
a fairly optimistic picture for investors in junk bonds 
contradicting a harvard university report released in april 
marshall e blume who conducted the study along with donald b 
keim for penns wharton school of business acknowledged that from 
1977 to 1988 many junk bonds defaulted the basis of the harvard 
studys conclusions but he said monday they still provided adequate 
compensation for investors 
the harvard study conducted by paul asquith now a professor at 
massachusetts institute of technologys sloan school of business 
studied all junk bonds issued in 1977 and 1978 it found that by 
nov 1 1988 more than 34 percent of these highrisk highyield 
bonds defaulted 
blume called the harvard report a catalyst for conducting the 
penn study on the same bonds which is scheduled for release 
tuesday but he said he and keim were not directly challenging 
asquiths findings 
he said the way researchers approached the investments may have 
resulted in the different conclusions on the safety of junk bonds 
which have a rating below investment grade and often are used to 
finance corporate takeovers 
blume said the penn study states the harvard study did not 
really look at the relevant variables 
blume said he concentrated on the rates of return to investors 
rather than the default rate 
according to blume the yield on the junk bonds which averaged 
851 percent a year during the period studied was higher than that 
of several other types of investments considered much safer such as 
triple arated corporate bonds which yielded 843 percent and 
intermediateterm treasury issues which yielded 76 percent 
if a bond defaults that doesnt necessarily mean you lose your 
shirt blume said 
exchanged bonds were counted in asquiths study as defaulted 
bonds blume said in some cases the company may have become a 
better credit risk and offered to exchange its junk bonds for 
investmentgrade bonds to eliminate restrictions often contained in 
junk bonds blume said 
however blume said the exchange factor may have affected 
asquiths findings by only 3 percent or 4 percent 
asquith was unable to be reached for comment late monday 
afternoon his office was closed and directory assistance did not 
have a listing for him in boston or cambridge mass

the big three automakers and major oil companies 
say they have held meetings on development of fuels that will 
satisfy president bushs cleanair proposal 
the first meeting was held in july and focused on developing 
fuels that could keep the performance characteristics of gasoline 
while eliminating much of the air pollution caused by 
gasolinepowered engines 
however representatives of general motors corp ford motor co 
and chrysler corp along with the american petroleum institute 
denied a report in mondays automotive news that they had decided to 
try to torpedo efforts to require that methanol be used as the fuel 
of the future 
the weekly journal also said the big three had signed commitments 
to use lesspolluting gasoline rather than methanol but company 
officials said no commitments have been signed 
the automotive news conclusion is dead wrong said ford 
spokeswoman beryl goldsweig gm and chrysler also disputed the claim 
monday 
however the companies didnt dispute the report in the trade 
journal that their officials had met with oil company officials to 
talk about future fuels 
this summer bush unveiled a clean air plan that beginning in 
1995 would phase in cars that burn clean fuels such as methanol 
in connecticut and the cities of los angeles houston new york 
milwaukee baltimore philadelphia san diego and chicago where air 
pollution problems are severe 
researchers for the big three the oil and gas industry and 
others have been busy in recent years working on cleanerburning 
fuels and reformulating gasoline 
gm ford and chrysler each has methanol fuel programs under way 
gm was a cosponsor this spring of a methanolpowered vehicle rally 
in which the automaker donated a dozen chevrolet corsicas for 
modification by colleges and universities the cars then were driven 
from detroit to washington via canada and new england 
also this summer atlantic richfield co began selling in 
southern california a new formula of a gasoline for use in older 
cars that burn leaded fuel the new gasoline arco has said causes 
less pollution 
another meeting of the automakers and oil company executives 
tentatively is set for january automotive news said by that time 
other oil companies were expected to join in the effort to steer 
research toward revamped gasoline 
ideally a new kind of gasoline would maintain the performance 
characteristics of todays fuel while significantly cutting tailpipe 
emissions 
elimination of methanolfuel research programs could save 
automakers millions of dollars in research and development and rule 
out some potentially heavy competition for oil refiners 
methanol is distinctly different than gasoline and presents 
automakers with a new set of design and engineering challenges 
while methanol is cheaper than gasoline more of it is needed to 
provide the same power as gasoline making fuel economy of methanol 
lower than gasolines also unlike gasoline methanol conducts 
electricity which could require extensive redesign of fuel 
injection systems and it is corrosive which would require new 
materials for the entire fuel delivery system 
producing methanol which is derived from coal or natural gas 
also could prove costly for refiners concentrating on gasoline 
in addition to developing cars that can run on methanol 
experiments are going on at each of the big three to develop a 
vehicle that could run on a variety of fuels such as methanol 
gasoline and ethanol which is made from corn

the securities and exchange commission and a 
toronto bank have settled charges that it violated federal banking 
regulations in an alleged stockbuying scheme that cheated more than 
100 brokerages 
without admitting or denying guilt torontodominion bank agreed 
monday not to violate federal banking and securities laws governing 
the extension of credit the bank also agreed to cooperate with the 
governments investigation of the case 
the sec last month accused torontodominion of illegally 
extending credit to a group of investors known as graycliff 
international sa to buy millions of dollars worth of securities 
without having enough money to pay for them 
according to the civil suit filed aug 2 in us district court 
in manhattan the bank allegedly allowed the investors to sell the 
stock on the same day at a profit to cover their cost in a scheme 
known as freeriding 
this is a very significant case from our point of view said 
martin kuperberg the secs associate regional administrator in new 
york 
it sends an important message to the banking and stock 
brokerage industry that the sec is not going to stand for this type 
of activity he said people have to pay for stock when they buy 
it 
kuperberg said officials knew of no other cases in which the sec 
had charged a bank involved in a freeriding case but that investors 
had been charged in the past 
he said there was no estimate of how much money the bank made 
from the accounts set up by the graycliff investors 
torontodominion officials did not return a telephone call 
seeking comment the bank said in a statement at the time of the 
suit that it had been cooperating with the sec for several months 
and was an innocent bystander to the investigation 
the sec charged investors jury matt hansen and fergus m sloan 
jr and their new york brokerage firm fermat associates with 
fraud in connection with the illegal stockselling practice the 
bank was not charged with fraud 
according to the suit the investors through graycliff opened an 
account at the new york branch of torontodominion which often 
covered the investors checks overnight when the funds in the 
account were insufficient 
the investors then allegedly opened about 250 accounts at more 
than 100 brokerage using 76 phony names the sec claims that the 
defendants used the accounts to buy and sell securities on the same 
day beginning in december 1984 
tornotodominion cleared both the buy and sell side of the stock 
transactions according to the sec 
the sec suit claims the men made more than 1 million through the 
scheme but left debts of 15 million at four brokerage houses at 
which they had steep losses steinberg amp lyman universal securities 
of america inc merrill lynch amp co and dominick amp dominick 
the sec said it found no losses at any other brokerages 
under its settlement torontodominion also agreed to set up a 
securities compliance committee to review the banks credit policies 
and implement a training program in the area

leaders of the united airlines pilots union say 
they are confident members will divert at least 200 million from a 
retirement fund to buy stock in ual corp as part of a 675 billion 
buyout of the airlines parent company 
knowing these pilots as i do and knowing the history of this 
thing i think youre going to be oversubscribed in spades said 
james damron a spokesman for the united chapter of the air line 
pilots association 
whether to commit retirement funds to the plan is a personal 
choice each of the approximately 6300 united pilots alpa represents 
will be asked to make damron said monday 
but rankandfile approval would not be needed for the new 
sevenyear pilots contract that is also part of the 
employeemanagement buyout plan a contract that includes lower pay 
longer hours shorter vacations and reduced medical benefits 
alpa outlined the proposed pilots contract in a 35page document 
mailed or distributed to members of the united chapter on monday 
meanwhile representatives of california investor marvin davis 
began an examination of uals books to determine whether the los 
angeles billionaire should raise his competing 619 billion offer 
for the chicagobased company 
uniteds pilots are spearheading a buyout bid that also includes 
ual management led by chairman stephen wolf and british airways 
plc under the proposal employees would own 75 percent of ual 
british airways would own 15 percent and management would own 10 
percent 
uniteds pilots have been seeking an ownership role in the 
nations secondlargest airline since 1987 when union members 
contributed 14 million to fund a study of an employee stock 
ownership program damron said 
the new pilots contract replacing one that expired in april 
1988 would be a sevenyear pact with a nostrike clause 
about twothirds of uniteds pilots the senior pilots who 
receive higher wages under the socalled a scale would have their 
pay cut 10 percent 
the more recently hired bscale pilots who earn only 55 percent 
as much would have their pay raised to 70 percent of the a scale 
and gain higher pay for flying larger aircraft they would then take 
10 percent cuts as well 
pilots would have to work 85 hours a month instead of 80 as 
currently required but they wouldnt be paid for four of the 
additional five hours 
some pilots would also have their medical benefits reduced via an 
increased deductible the mailing contained no details on the 
cutback in vacation time 
damron said the pilots would like all of uniteds employees to 
participate in the bid but the machinists the airlines largest 
unionized group with 25000 workers have expressed skepticism about 
the proposed buyout citing the enormous debt that would be incurred 
uniteds 12700 flight attendants are considering joining the 
pilots and were to hear managements proposal today said pat 
friend spokeswoman for the association of flight attendants 
asked if the attendants would accept concessions similar to those 
the pilot leaders agreed to she said as far as i know the 
flight attendants are not willing to give up anything we havent 
for two years 
the flight attendants have been without a contract since november 
1987 
davis and ual signed a confidentiality agreement friday giving 
davis access to the companys financial records in exchange for his 
promise not to attempt a hostile takeover of the company for one 
year

christiana companies inc of san diego has had discussions with 
stroh for about six weeks said sheldon lubar who heads lubar amp 
co a milwaukee venture capital firm that owns a controlling stake 
in christiana 
thats all it is discussions lubar said monday 
lubar a former director of the pabst brewing co said 
christiana considered stroh a worthwhile opportunity 
we are knowledgeable in the industry he said we have had 
extensive conversations on the subject i really cant say anymore 
christiana primarily a real estate company has broadened its 
holdings in recent months in july it bought a controlling interest 
in prideco inc a houstonbased supplier to the oil and gas 
industry 
john collopy president of the milwaukee investment firm of 
cleary gull reiland mcdevitt amp collopy inc said he guessed that if 
christiana were successful it would run stroh primarily for cash 
i dont think their intent in getting involved there was to 
turn it around collopy said 
lacey logan a spokeswoman for detroitbased stroh said she 
could not confirm whether stroh had talked with christiana 
any negotiations are confidential ms logan said but we 
are continuing our search for a minority investment 
stroh has seen its market share drop to 107 percent in 1988 from 
13 percent in 1983 the company earlier this month cut 300 jobs 
stroh announced this year that it was seeking a minority partner 
to broaden its scope in the international beer market 
among those initially expressing interest was bond corp holdings 
ltd a perth australia company that owns the g heileman brewing 
co 
more recently stroh reportedly has discussed deals with domestic 
bidders including lubar the adolph coors brewing co and sampp co 
owner of pabst 
beer marketers insights an industry newsletter said monday 
that stroh rejected a 500 million bid in august from some of its 
top management 
some analysts trace strohs current woes to its 1982 purchase of 
jos schlitz brewing co 
the continued decline in the schlitz brand combined with the 
large amount of overhead stroh bought im sure that is having a 
deleterious effect on strohs bottom line collopy said

manufacturers hanover corp said it is discussing 
the sale of part of its cit group financial services unit to 
japanese banking giant daiichi kangyo bank ltd but the new york 
company refused to comment on overseas reports that a deal had been 
struck for sale of the entire division 
nikkei telecom a japanese financial newswire and the japanese 
financial newspaper nihon keizai shinbun reported monday that 
daiichi agreed to buy the cit subsidiary for 15 billion both 
reports said an announcement would come in a few days 
the purchase would be the largest purchase of a us company by a 
japanese bank according to nihon keizai shinbun it also would be 
the first significant us purchase by daiichi the worlds largest 
bank 
cit provides loans and leases to mediumsized businesses from 
offices nationwide 
in a terse statement issued a half hour before the stock market 
closed monday manufacturers hanover confirmed serious 
discussions with daiichi but referred to the proposal as a 
joint ownership of its wholly owned subsidiary the cit group 
manufactuers stock closed up 287 to 4250 in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
john meyers a manufacturers hanover spokesman said the bank 
would have no further comment on the form the deal might take i 
think the statement pretty much speaks for itself he said 
daiichi spokesman yasutoshi tonegawa said the two sides were 
negotiating the possibility of capital participation in the cit 
group but he said it was premature to say whether the result would 
be a daiichi buyout or joint ownership 
banking analysts said such a deal would come as no surprise 
the bank has indicated that it is in the throes of a 
recapitalization plan that could amount to 15 to 2 billion and 
as part of that it could sell some of its assets said james j 
mcdermott jr of keefe bruyette amp woods in new york

reserves against third world debt to an average 50 percent from the 
current average 32 percent and therefore need more capital

206 billion down from 253 billion a year earlier

instead of cramming more transistors onto 
computer chips to make them to work faster intel corp has solved 
the elusive problem of how to get the chips to carry out two tasks 
at once at superfast speeds 
intel today is showing off its 32bit i960ca microprocessor the 
first commercial chip to employ superscalar technology 
the chip which is smaller than a dime packs 600000 transistors 
and is capable of carrying out up to 66 million instructions per 
second the i486 introduced last spring has twice as many 
transistors but is less than half as fast as the i960ca 
superscalar design allows a chip to execute more than one 
instruction for each tick of its internal clock 
imagine a car wash that can run two lanes through at a time 
instead of one said michael slater editor of microprocessor 
report an industry newsletter in palo alto the car wash with two 
lanes can obviously get more cars through in the same time 
intels speed rating for the i960ca chip is derived from taking 
the chips clock speed 33 million cycles per second and doubling 
it 
many other chipmakers are working on superscalar designs said 
slater who expects to see several of those products next year and 
many more in 1991 japanese chipmakers though are much more 
focused on inexpensive processors for consumer products and not 
putting as much effort in the highend chips such as superscalar 
technology slater said 
this chip may or may not sell in large numbers over the next 
year or two slater said the high volume high performance 
markets have been elusive i dont think there will be millions of 
units sold in the next couple of years but the superscalar 
technology will ultimately be high volume 
millard h phelps an analyst with hambrecht amp quist in san 
francisco said the i960 shows that were going into a new era 
of microprocessors 
computers have been doing multitasking and multiprocessing and 
were going in that direction right down to the chip itelf phelps 
said thats quite a departure 
intel the company that invented the microprocessor says the 
i960ca is the fastest 32bit chip yet but the chip which is 
expected to be priced at about 300 isnt compatible with msdos or 
other software commonly used in desktop computers and isnt expected 
to have an immediate impact on that market 
instead the chip is aimed at laser printers robot controllers 
telephone switching systems and automobiles of the future the auto 
industry which is largely using 8bit chips is slowly moving into 
faster 16bit chips and may be several years away from using the 
superfast 32bit chips to control brakes and engines 
the i960 design has been endorsed by a group of avionics systems 
suppliers and could have a significant impact in that field said 
thomas a thornhill of shearson lehman hutton inc in san francisco 
thats a pretty strong endorsement for the architecture 
thornhill said 
what i think is interesting beyond the product itself 
thornhill said is that some of the design techniques used to 
achieve the superscalar architecture may be applicable to intels 
other chips and may show up in other products like the i860 and 
future versions of the 486 in the past intel has tended to do some 
of its design work in modular form so it can be applied or altered 
for other chips 
intels i860 chip introduced earlier this year also is capable 
of doing certain types of operations two at a time but doesnt 
employ the superscalar design the i860 a 64bit microprocessor 
with more than 1 million transistors is capable of performing up to 
80 million calculations per second the 750 chip is designed for 
highend workstations and is more mathintensive than the i960ca

an internal report released by miniscribe 
corp says former senior managers of the computer diskdrive maker 
have perpetrated a massive fraud on the company over the past 
three years 
the report released monday by miniscribe a manufacturer of 
computer disk drives paints a picture of a company run amok under 
the direction of then chief executive officer qt wiles once known 
as the dr fix it of the hightech industry 
miniscribe stock closed monday at 206 per share in 
overthecounter trading down 18 cents from friday and down from 
its 1988 high of nearly 14 per share 
it appears that miniscribes senior management perpetrated a 
massive fraud on the company its directors its outside auditors 
and the investing public said the report written by an internal 
evaluation committee 
this fraud was all the more alarming in that it required the 
active participation of many company personnel and was apparently 
common knowledge among a great many other employees 
under pressure from investor lawsuits miniscribe initiated the 
inhouse investigation last march into possible misconduct under the 
wiles administration a copy of the 1500page report that emerged 
was given monday to the enforcement division of the securities and 
exchange commission 
regulators there will determine if legal action is warranted and 
the us justice department could become involved if criminal 
prosecution is pursued 
according to the report miniscribe was so poorly managed at the 
time that senior officials including wiles fabricated company 
financial statements with tactics that included shipping bricks and 
scrap parts disguised as computer disk drives to confuse auditors 
wiles ran the company from april 1985 until his resignation in 
february 1989 his entire management team also has departed 
wiles 70 had led miniscribe through a remarkable turnabout from 
april 1985 through 1988 using 20 million from the venture capital 
firm of san franciscobased hambrecht amp quist wiles brought the 
company back from the verge of bankruptcy 
by injecting miniscribe with the 20 million and ruthlessly 
slashing costs wiles boosted sales from 1139 million in 1985 to a 
nowdisputed 603 million in 1988 
miniscribe reported a 146 million loss for the fourth quarter 
of 1988 it was shortly thereafter that wiles stepped down and 
essentially disappeared 
in may miniscribe announced that its financial reports for 1986 
1987 and the first three quarters of 1988 were not reliable on 
monday the compoany said its restated financial results will show 
that the company has a negative net worth 
richard c rifenburgh the new chief executive officer said 
monday it is now up to the company to move forward to solve the 
remaining problems 
at the same time we must ensure that miniscribe reaps the 
benefits of the hard work and the dedication that employees have 
exhibited during these difficult times 
despite an anticipated 500 million in sales this year 
miniscribe will likely post large losses rifenburgh said

the six defendants convicted of unlawful 
securities trading in the princetonnewport partners lp case have 
asked a federal judge to overturn the verdict on the grounds that 
the trading was legal 
in a memorandum filed monday with us district judge robert l 
carter attorneys for the defendants also argued that the 
racketeering statute they were convicted under is 
unconstitutionally vague 
five former partners in the defunct investment firm and a former 
drexel burnham lambert inc trader were convicted july 31 on 63 of 
64 counts in the first securities racketeering case ever the jury 
required the defendants to forfeit 38 million in assets 
prosecutors recently filed a separate memorandum with carter 
seeking to force the defendants to forfeit 192 million the full 
amount possible under the racketeering law carter has indicated he 
is inclined to overrule the jury 
two of the counts were charged under the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act which carries stiff prison 
terms and a requirement to forfeit profits from the alleged 
wrongdoing plus interest and salaries during the period 
the defendants in the case are are former princetonnewport 
officials james sutton regan jack z rabinowitz charles zarzecki 
paul a berkman and steven b smotrich and former drexel trader 
bruce lee newberg 
the case overlaps the governments 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment of former drexel financier michael milken 
much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at milkens 
trial scheduled to begin in march 1990 
princetonnewport a small securities firm with offices in 
princeton nj and newport beach calif went out of business 
after the indictment was brought last august neither 
princetonnewport nor drexel were charged in the case 
the defendants were convicted of various conspiracy 
racketeering mail wire and securities fraud charges the 
government alleged they arranged to sell securities at a loss and 
then repurchase them later in a scheme to generate bogus tax losses 
in their memo the princetonnewport lawyers argued that the 
trades were legal under internal revenue service guidelines and 
other cases allowed similar trades 
they also said the racketeering statute was vague citing a 
recent superme court case in which four justices invited a 
constitutional challenge to the law on the grounds of vagueness

630 pm edt to go headtohead with the networks and cnn 
anchorman bernard shaw could have a role on the program cnn 
spokesman steve haworth said

rather would be a good idea 
there are a number of changes were talking about and thats 
one of the changes he said 
the proposal calls for a halfhour standalone newscast unlike 
cnns virtually 24hour allnews format in which the news is 
continuously updated 
cnn currently runs news in the 6630 period and shows the 
entertainment news program show biz today at 630 pm when 
nbc abc and cbs air the first of their evening news feeds or 
transmissions to affiliate stations the networks also produce an 
updated feed at 7 pm

of the program was premature the texas judge was hired monday as a 
newscaster 
shes on the bench until the end of september when she comes 
up with us and starts doing some training well start figuring

and officials say the program has been a smash so far 
using interlink systems provided by first interstate bank three 
santa ana post offices and two in irvine have been accepting the 
cards for about two months 
the system works like this the customer hands his atm card to a 
postal clerk who passes the magnetic strip through a reader that 
records the customers name and account number the customer enters 
his secret code and the amount of purchase into a handheld keyboard 
we are very happy with it said florinda bailey manager of 
commercial accounts at the postal services santa ana division 
which encompasses most of orange county and parts of los angeles 
county 
the average atm card purchase is 3369 up from 2704 worth of 
stamps when the program began and before a promotional program ms 
bailey told the orange county register 
each system costs about 800 a price expected to drop if the 
postal service goes ahead with the systems around the nation the

the usda projected the corn crop at 732 billion bushels 
compared with its august estimate of 735 billion and last years 
harvest of 492 billion 
the agency pegged 1989 soybean production at 189 billion 
bushels compared with last months estimate of 191 billion and 
last years harvest of 154 billion 
the soybean number was near expectations and should have little 
market impact the corn estimate was slightly higher than expected 
and could prompt some selling of corn futures on wednesday 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in september at 393 a bushel corn was 
2 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 236 a bushel oats

paramount communications inc said tuesday its 
thirdquarter profit tumbled 201 percent as a hefty charge stemming 
from its failed bid for time inc more than offset a strong showing 
in entertainment 
the overall results fell largely within expectations although 
some analysts said they were disappointed that paramounts 
publishing operations posted only a modest improvement from a year 
ago 
paramount which changed its name from gulf amp western inc in 
june said it earned 963 million or 80 cents per share for the 
three months ended july 31 compared with 1205 million or 1 a 
share a year earlier 
the earnings results reflected a 483 million aftertax charge 
for costs incurred in paramounts failed bid for time time which 
had already agreed to merge with warner communications inc 
rejected the offer from paramount 
analysts said paramounts charge had been widely anticipated and 
focused on the companys operating income from continuing 
operations which rose 173 percent to 1453 million from 1239 
million 
thirdquarter revenue rose 196 percent to 9506 million from 
7951 million a year earlier 
the revenue figures exclude revenue from the associates the 
financial services company which paramount has agreed to sell to 
ford motor co for 335 billion in a deal expected to be completed 
by oct 31 the company failed to provide revenue figures for the 
associates although its results were included in the earnings 
figures 
the results were fairly good despite some weak spots in 
publishing said andrew wallach who follows the entertainment 
company stocks for drexel burnham lambert inc 
jack kelly who follows diversified companies for the investment 
firm goldman sachs amp co agreed with that assessment saying 
publishing was disappointing but entertainment was above 
expectations 
paramount said it had record thirdquarter operating income from 
its entertainment operations as revenue rose substantially at its 
motion picture television and theater operations 
wallach said operating income in entertainment rose 487 percent 
to 575 million while revenue rose 236 percent to 5065 million 
the strong results from motion picture operations reflected the 
performances of movies such as indiana jones and the last crusade 
pet sematary and major league in us markets and the 
accused and naked gun in foreign markets 
the company said television operations reflected the success of 
the arsenio hall show and star trek the next generation and 
that results from its theater operations were up partly because of 
attendance increases generated by a larger number of successful 
motion picture releases 
the madison square garden unit had a loss of unspecified 
magnitude however due to the closing of the facility for 
renovations this summer 
an increase in results from publishing reflected gains in 
educational publishing that more than offset declines in consumer 
publishing and professional information operations the company said 
wallach said publishing revenue rose 152 percent to 4441 
million while operating income rose 42 percent to 1039 million 
he said the paramount consumer books segment is weak because 
they dont have a hit right now kelly said orders for old 
titles were also sluggish 
wallach said the professional information operations which 
consist mainly of a tax information service generated flat revenue 
and increased costs 
kelly said the tax services performance may trigger the sale 
of the unit over the next few months 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year paramount said its 
earned 2311 million or 193 a share down 4 percent from 2407 
million or 2 a share a year earlier 
ninemonth revenue rose 142 percent to 242 billion from 212 
billion a year earlier

executives of inland steel industries inc and 
nippon steel corp on tuesday announced plans to spend 450 million 
to build two steelcoating lines at their nearly completed 
jointventure plant in indiana 
the lines called in kote should strengthen inlands position 
as a supplier to the appliance and auto industries primary markets 
for corrosionresistant coated steel products said frank luerssen 
chairman and chief executive of the company at a news conference 
the move will measurably strengthen our joint commitment to 
meet the needs for differentiated steel products in the american 
market luerssen said we now see customers lining up to get 
their share of the materials 
the two production lines will have an annual capacity of 900 
finished tons and will be constructed next to a nearly completed new 
carlisle ind plant where inland and nippon are finishing work on 
a continuous coldrolling mill called in tek 
in tek and inland steels indiana harbor works in east chicago 
ind will provide all the sheet steel for in kote 
the 900 million complex being built at new carlisle ind by 
chicagobased inland and tokyobased nippon is believed to represent 
the largest spending program so far for an americanjapanese joint 
venture in the united states 
it will bring 400 new jobs to the south bend ind area 
the new coating lines will take the coldrolled steel produced at 
the plant and coat it using an electrogalvanizing process or a 
hotdip line 
automakers use galvanized steels highergrade sheets on exposed 
car panels and hotdipped sheets for such things as panels for light 
truck beds 
inland the sixthlargest steel company in the nation supplies 
the three major us carmakers ford chrysler and general motors 
and major japanese auto manufacturers including honda nissan and 
toyota 
nippon is the largest steel maker in the world exporting about 8 
million tons 
hiroshi saito president of nippon said the venture with inland 
represented a joint commitment to japanese carmakers who have built 
us plants and to american companies with a demand for the 
materials 
saito said the new plant will be entirely operational in 1991 
with in tek beginning operations next year 
such ventures he said work to ease tensions about the trade 
imbalance between the united states and japan 
i am confident that this undertaking will play a major symbolic 
role as a constructive attempt to resolve issues between the two 
economies through mutual understanding and cooperation saito said 
in a prepared statement 
nippon and inland will contribute 150 million each to in kote 
with the rest sponsored by debtfinancing inland is assuming 60 
percent of the construction costs for in tek also a joint venture 
inland this year has experienced three consecutive quarterly 
declines blamed partly on seasonal softness in orders but luerssen 
predicted a small gain for the companys fourth quarter

the senate finance committee searched tuesday 
for ways to scale back catastrophicillness protection for retirees 
in a lastditch effort to prevent repeal of the program which has 
drawn the ire of many older americans 
there was a recognition that there certainly is the possibility 
of repeal sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the panel 
said after a closeddoor session with members there is no 
question in my mind that we are going to face an amendment on the 
senate floor to repeal catastrophic 
there apparently is even stronger sentiment in the house for 
repeal a fact made clear tuesday to the bush administration 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush is feeling the heat from complaining retirees but is not 
sure that repeal is the best way to fix the program the 
administration prefers to work on changing the taxes that finance 
catastrophic care fitzwater said 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia who along with 
other gop leaders met with bush said he has noted a dramatic 
shift in the administrations willingness to amend the program 
we recognize the impact on the elderly fitzwater said we 
recognize their concern were working with congress searching 
for a way to mitigate the financial problems and save the program 
to stave off repeal bentsen said the committee is now 
attempting to strip away all but basic elements of the program to 
reduce costs to the minimum this could lead to elimination of most 
benefits for prescription drugs and for skilled nursing care the 
chairman said 
catastrophic illness coverage was enacted with fanfare last year 
to protect medicare beneficiaries from financial ruin brought on by 
the cost of serious illness everyone eligible for medicare is 
required to pay into the program 
the additional coverage is under heavy attack from two groups of 
retirees some who are covered by private and employerfinanced 
insurance and dont need catastrophiccare coverage and some who 
are higherincome americans having to pay for protection for those 
at the bottom of the economic scale 
responding to those protests the house ways and means committee 
already has voted to reduce benefits and the two taxes that finance 
the program 
about twothirds of the costs are paid by retirees whose incomes 
are high enough that they pay more than 150 a year in federal 
income taxes they must pay a surtax up to 800 of 15 percent of 
their income taxes about 40 percent of all retirees are liable for 
the surtax this year 
the remainder of the program is financed by a flat 4 monthly 
premium paid by all but the poorest of the 33 million people 
eligible for medicare 
the finance committee agreed informally last week that the surtax 
would be cut significantly that the flat monthly premium would not 
be changed and that beneficiaries would have to pay a bigger share 
of expenses for drugs and doctors bills before reimbursement under 
the catastrophiccare program begins 
tuesdays committee session indicated however that that 
apparently was not enough to mollify those who want repeal 
as a result bentsen said what we are trying to do is 
structure a bill with essential parts that gets it back to a 
morecatastrophic bill instead of the longterm benefits which 
seem to be exploding costs 
when catastrophicillness protection was enacted last year it 
was predicted to cost about 31 billion over five years the latest 
forecasts put that figure at 45 billion or more skillednursing 
benefits and prescription drugs are major factors in the escalation 
bentsen and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas a member 
of the committee complained that the administrations concern 
appears to be based mainly on budget considerations not on how 
catastrophicillness coverage or its repeal would affect older 
americans 
the program is based on an insurance concept so taxes to finance 
it are being collected at a faster rate than benefits are being 
paid as a result repeal would deprive the treasury of 4 billion 
to 7 billion this year and worsen the federal deficit by that 
amount 
unless the budget law is waived repeal of the program would 
require congress to raise taxes to make up for the revenue loss 
otherwise repeal would trigger acrosstheboard cuts in most 
federal programs

hewlettpackard co introduced a 
lowcost workstation tuesday the first computer product unveiled 
since it acquired its former rival apollo computer inc 
the electronics company which bought apollo last april for 476 
million announced the apollo series 2500 its lowest cost 
workstation priced at 3990 its also one of the cheapest in the 
field 
the workstation uses a 68030 microprocessor from motorola inc 
and comes with 4 megabytes of internal memory and a monochrome 
display monitor but unlike more advanced workstations its not 
capable of displaying color graphics 
david perozek general manager of hps apollo systems division 
said the apollo series 2500 had been planned before the 
hewlettpackard purchase and proved the two companies were working 
well together 
but analysts said hewlettpackard is not assured of holding on to 
its lead in workstations or powerful desktop computers unless it 
creates bold products that can compete with industry leaders such as 
sun microsystems inc of mountain view 
the 2500 runs software developed for apollos line of 
workstations which use a version of the unix operating system known 
as domain hp uses its own version of unix the two companies said 
they plan to offer software that will work with both computer lines 
but that they will not be available for two to three years 
seymour merrin president of merrin information services a palo 
alto consulting firm said hewlettpackard had to unveil a lowcost 
product to be competitive with sun he also said the current 
workstation price war will make it hard for companies to get enough 
profits from their products 
you cant afford to sell those things at that price said 
merrin the bigger companies will be able to take a hit for awhile 
and the smaller ones will not dropping prices like that is crazy 
but competitively youve got to be there merrin said 
hps apollo division also announced on tuesday graphics software 
and hardware products for use with topofthe line apollo 
workstations with prices ranging from 20000 to 35000 the 
desktop visualization system allows engineers to see clear 
representations of their designs simulated on a computer screen

berkshire hathaway inc stock already at 
everestlike heights gained another 275 a share on tuesday to 
close at 8575 on the new york stock exchange 
investors are flocking to berkshire hathaway because of the 
stockpicking reputation of the holding companys chairman warren 
buffett who is sometimes called the oracle of omaha for his 
success in choosing solid companies with good longterm prospects 
the stock is up 80 percent since last nov 29 when it began 
trading on the new york stock exchange at 4750 a share before 
that it had been listed overthecounter 
most companies split their stock when it gets too high so that 
round lots of 100 shares remain affordable to small investors but 
people familar with buffett say he likes the special image that the 
high price gives to berkshire hathaway 
no plans to do anything j verne mckenzie the chief 
financial officer said in a fiveword interview tuesday when asked 
whether the company was considering a split 
the new york stock exchange changed its rules last year in a way 
that permits berkshire hathaway stock to be traded in round lots of 
10 shares instead of the usual 100 extra commission is charged on 
smaller odd lots but many investors nonetheless buy a single share 
berkshire hathaways high stock price is the result of having 
relatively few shares outstanding for example if exxon corp had 
as few shares as berkshire hathaway its price per share would be 
14000 instead of about 45 
the price of bershire hathaway shares is so large many 
newspapers have trouble squeezing the full price of berkshire 
hathaway into their listings at the associated press a computer 
program that processes stock prices had to be modified tuesday when 
it was discovered that the share price exceeded the programs 
previous pershare ceiling of 8192 
berkshire hathaway has holdings in companies ranging from 
cocacola co to gillette co salomon inc capital citiesabc 
inc insurance companies a candy maker and an encyclopedia 
publisher buffetts family holding of 45 percent of berkshire 
hathaways stock makes him a billionaire

price report which will indicate whether inflation is accelerating

interest rates upward

coffee futures prices plunged tuesday on new yorks coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange on indications the united states will not support a 
return to international export quotas that would raise coffee prices 
on other markets sugar futures rose sharply grains and soybeans 
were lower energy futures weakened precious metals advanced and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
all new york coffee futures except the contract for september 
delivery plunged the permitted daily limit of 6 cents a pound the 
limitless september contract tumbled 668 cents to 8148 cents a 
pound a 2week low 
analysts said prices plummeted amid panicked selling prompted by 
a report that the bush administration will reject colombias plea 
for us support in pushing for a resumption of export quotas among 
producer members of the international coffee organization 
the 74nation cartel suspended the quotas in july amid discord 
caused in part by us demands for controls on sales of coffee at 
cutrate prices to sovietbloc nations that are not ico members the 
united states is the organizations largest consumer member 
coffee prices had strengthened in the past two weeks on 
speculation that the bush administration would take a more 
conciliatory stance in ico talks as part of its war on drugs 
a return to export quotas would lead to higher coffee prices and 
help the economy of colombia which needs money to battle cocaine 
cartels colombian president virgilio barco sent a letter to 
president bush lask week saying the sharp drop in coffee prices 
since july 3 was having devastating consequences on the 
colombian economy and urging bush to support a return to the coffee 
quota system 
state department officials would not confirm tuesdays report 
that bush will reject barcos plea 
but in a related development sen richard lugar who sits on the 
senate foreign relations committee told reporters the united states 
will not waver in its opposition to the existing international 
coffee agreement 
sugar futures prices soared in new york after the united states 
announced it had raised its 1989 sugar import quota by 860000 
metric tons to 199 million and had extended the import quota period 
by nine months to sept 30 1990 
sugar futures rose 37 cent to 54 cent with october at 1395 
cents a pound 
corn and soybean futures fell moderately on the chicago board of 
trade pressured by a lack of overnight frost in the midwest and 
forecasts for improved crop weather next week oat and wheat futures 
also retreated 
after the close the agriculture department issued a new crop 
report revising downward its august estimates for 1989 us corn and 
soybean production and raising its wheatcrop estimate 
the usda projected the corn crop at 732 billion bushels compared 
with its august estimate of 735 billion and last years harvest of 
492 billion 
the agency pegged 1989 soybean production at 189 billion bushels 
compared with last months estimate of 191 billion and last years 
harvest of 154 billion 
the usda projected total 1989 us wheat production at 206 
billion bushels compared to last months estimate of 204 billion 
and last years 181 billion 
analysts termed the soybean number neutral but said the 
higherthanexpected corn and wheat estimates could cause futures 
prices to drop wednesday 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
september at 393 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
september at 236 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 3 cents lower

the chairman of the senate finance committee 
proposed tuesday that deductible individual retirement accounts be 
offered all taxpayers as a substitute for reducing the tax on 
capital gains 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas whose committee is expected to write 
a tax bill later this month said his plan also would allow 
penaltyfree withdrawals from iras to buy a first home or finance a 
college education 
bentsen who has been a consistent supporter of a capitalgains 
tax cut said the federal deficit is too big to allow both such a 
reduction which president bush has recommended and expanded iras 
we must make a choice of which will do more to encourage 
saving and i am convinced that my ira deserves priority bentsen 
told a news conference cutting capital gains taxes is an 
investment incentive for a few but the problem is broader than that 
with the ira wed have the participation of a broad spectrum of 
middle america 
bentsen made his proposal public an hour before the house ways 
and means committee resumed consideration of a capitalgains 
reduction he said it had been warmly received by the senate 
democratic caucus and by majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
a bushbacked capitalgains cut has a onevote majority on the 
house panel but democratic leaders have postponed consideration 
several times in an effort to turn around at least one of the six 
democrats who favor the reduction 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of ways and means found 
little support among fellow democrats for his latest attempt at a 
capitalgains compromise although several republicans seemed 
willing to accept it the proposal would protect capital gains 
against inflation and provide a special break for longterm holders 
of assets 
the panel put off further consideration until wednesday 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stock and other 
assets are taxed at the same rate as other income ranging up to 33 
percent the compromise bill that bush backs sponsored chiefly by 
reps ed jenkins dga and bill archer rtexas would cut the top 
rate to 196 percent for 2 years the top rate then would rise to 
28 percent investors would be protected against having to pay taxes 
on profits generated by inflation 
there is general agreement that the proposal would increase tax 
collections for a year by encouraging investors to sell longheld 
assets after that democrats say it would cut tax collections 
bush insists it would raise money in the long run 
the joint committee on taxation estimates that the jenkins 
capitalgains cut would cost about 5 billion in lost revenue in 
1994 while bentsens ira plan would cost 4 billion 
ira affects average folks bentsen said it helps address 
three of the primary concerns of middleincome americans 
lowerincome americans buying that first home financing a college 
education and providing for ones retirement 
under his proposal a person could contribute up to 2000 a year 
to an ira and avoid current taxation on half the sum the 
contribution and the interest earned would not be taxed until the 
money was withdrawn for retirement tuition or making the down 
payment on a first home 
since passage of the 1986 tax overhaul fully deductible iras 
have been available only to workers not covered by a company pension 
and to single people earning less than 25000 and couples under 
40000 
in 1986 when deductible iras were available to all workers 
nearly 38 billion was contributed to such accounts almost 15 
percent of all taxpayers claimed an ira deduction those figures 
have dropped significantly since that time 
when deductible iras were scaled back they were criticized as 
rewarding people who would save anyway and as encouraging the 
transfer of savings from taxable accounts into iras 
however bentsen said a new study commissioned by merrill lynch 
consumer markets disputes those points that study concluded that 80 
percent of ira contributions were new savings

economic policies of the united states the 
leading member of the international monetary fund were repeatedly 
critized and sometimes praised in the funds annual report tuesday 
the 22 bankerdiplomats on the executive board singled out the 
twin trade and budget deficits and the federal tax system for 
concern one of the sharpest words the fund uses 
concern was also expressed but less often about policies of 
west germany britain and italy japan was urged to speed some 
changes 
the fund uses contributions from its members to help out 
countries in economic trouble usually requiring changes in economic 
policy in exchange for its loans it makes regular appraisals of its 
leading members but publishes only a short summary the us 
government has the biggest voting strength in the fund 1914 
percent 
the report said brisk economic expansion in the united states 
last year contributed to economic growth in the rest of the world 
but it noted concerns about inflation because the united states 
was using its resources so close to capacity 
many us experts have had the same worries but have been 
reassured by the small size of recent increases in the major price 
indexes 
the report noted previous cuts in the federal deficit but added 
concern was expressed that further substantial reductions would 
not be forthcoming soon it said the board emphasized the 
importance of decisive action to reduce the fiscal deficit 
the federal tax system was criticized as discouraging private 
saving and distorting investment the heavy excess of us imports 
over exports was called a major source of vulnerability and 
concern was mentioned again because pressures remain strong to 
protect american business against foreign competition through trade 
barriers 
the board praised the federal reserve for making credit easily 
available in response to the stock market crash of 1987 but said 
rising interest rates caused concern however us interest 
rates have been falling since april when the funds fiscal year 
ended 
the word concern did not appear in the appraisal of japan 
though it said the japanese have much to do to speed up improvements 
in land management farming and the distribution system the 
directors said japan should let in more foreign goods especially 
farm products 
but they praised japanese tax reform and what they called the 
skillful monetary policy sound financial policies and the continued 
outlook for growth without inflation 
in west germany the board said it was concerned about high 
unemployment the large surplus of exports over imports and the 
decision to raise taxes in 1989 
action on deregulation has been slow and disincentives in some 
critical sectors continue to hamper economic activity the report 
said without elaboration 
for britain concern was expressed that demand had grown 
too rapidly and had begun to show up in higher inflation and a 
larger trade deficit 
for italy the board said it was concerned that slippages 
in controlling public expenditure had set back efforts to control 
inflation and stabilize interest and exchange rates 
the report did not go into the issue that is expected to 
preoccupy the fund for the next three month the scheduled increase 
in the member contributions now the equivalent of 1188 billion 
some us officials have said they are yet to be convinced that 
the increase is needed managing director michel camdessus wants the 
total doubled others want smaller increases
