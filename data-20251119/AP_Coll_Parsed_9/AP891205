rebel and government forces called a 
ceasefire wednesday and evacuated hundreds of americans and other 
foreigners from hotels in makati financial area where fighting had 
kept them trapped for four days 
the military chief named a negotiator to discuss a peaceful end 
to the crisis with rebels who began a coup attempt against 
president corazon aquino last friday 
mrs aquino had earlier ruled out talks with the rebels and told 
them surrender or die in an emotional tv address wednesday 
mrs aquino appealed to the filipino people for support 
speaking extemporaneously an obviously fatigued mrs aquino 
asked filipinos to turn out in the streets friday in a show of 
support like the february 1986 people power uprising that 
propelled her into office and drove ferdinand marcos into exile 
wednesday was the sixth day of the insurrection 
you my beloved countrymen i depend on you she said let 
us see each other on dec 8 and show to the world that the majority 
of the filipinos believe in democracy and will give everything they 
can for progress and for peace 
the appeal seemed to be a sign that mrs aquino faces mounting 
pressure amid the armed challenge by military mutineers and demands 
from her own followers for substantial changes in her policies and 
administration 
i know that i owe my presidency to you she told the people 
i did not think of being your president i just wanted to serve 
you i just want to restore democracy i want to respect your 
rights i am only asking you to help me you are my only source of 
strength for me to continue our reforms in government i also 
depend on you to see for yourself what these people are doing 
against us 
vicky benito a receptionist at the manila garden hotel in the 
makati district said wednesday morning all americans are safe 
the americans are all ok 
the us embassy and philippine authorities said 164 americans 
were out safely and that the evacuatio appeared complete also 
reported out and safe were 70 british 14 swiss 26 west germans 
17 singaporeans 210 japanese 40 australians and 41 canadians 
at least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded 
since rebel soldiers began their coup attempt 
a statement by the armed forces said the ceasefire would remain 
in effect until further orders in order to allow a smooth 
withdrawal of hotel guests from the makati area 
but the statement by military chief of staff gen renato de 
villa also said the ceasefire was in connection with ongoing 
negotiations to end the fighting 
de villa designated brig gen arturo enrile superintendent of 
the philippine military academy to talk with rebels in the 
financial district 
more than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a 
shopping area near the airport where evacuees were taken until 
arrangements can be made for them to leave the country 
us consul bruce beardsley some of those evacuated would leave 
the philippines on the first available flight 
a rebel officer said tuesday that the estimated 215 trapped 
americans might not go free because of us support for mrs aquino 
during the uprising including providing air cover early in the 
revolt 
but a statement issued wednesday said the insurgents executive 
committee decided late tuesday to free all the americans because 
these american tourists are not our enemy 
on wednesday however a statement issued in the name of a rebel 
leader brig gen edgardo abenina declared the insurgents were in 
a state of war 
we advise the us government to prepare a plan for the 
evacuation of its nationals as the impotent aquino administration 
may not be able to ensure their safety said the statement 
distributed to news organizations 
we appeal to the american people to exert pressure on the 
united states government to refrain from pursuing any policy or 
action which may trigger a new philippineamerican war 
about 2000 foreigners were believed trapped in hotels and 
apartments in the area which the rebels seized saturday on the 
second day of their uprising it was slick said crosby nash 
58 of centerville md of the evacuation he had been stranded at 
the manila garden hotel it was a superb operation i think 
theres certainly relief 
fanny dickins a briton who lives in hong kong said staff at 
the intercontinental woke guests at 730 am and told them to 
report to the lobby with their smallest piece of luggage 
she said a rebel officer was in the lobby to see off the 
foreigners some of them posed for pictures with him 
i found them all sympathetic she said of the insurgents 
they were very nice and extremely polite all of them 
safe passage for the foreigners was delayed tuesday however 
hundreds of other residents of the district were able to flee amid 
the most serious coup attempt so far against mrs aquino 
wednesdays evacuation included not only foreigners and 
filipinos in the areas three luxury hotels but also in 
condominiums lining ayala avenue and other thoroughfares 
manila radio stations broadcast instructions to condominium 
residents to stay in front of their buildings until the buses 
arrived for pickup 
private filipinos offered accommodation to foreigners because 
hotels were jammed with makati residents who fled earlier 
rafael alunan undersecretary of tourism negotiated tuesday 
with the rebel leader in makati talks at the intercontinental 
hotel ended at sunset but apparently resumed early wednesday the 
rebels offered monday to let the foreigners leave 
earlier insurgent capt albert yen said that the intention is 
not to release americans us meddling has caused the failure 
of the first wave of our assault so we hold them liable it is the 
responsibility of the us government if we take their nationals 
hostage 
on friday us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist 
forces the planes did not fire on the rebels but kept them from 
continuing air strikes from villamor air base rebels seized the 
base early in the coup attempt 
in washington the bush administration had expressed public 
concern for the trapped americans 
you can be assured that the pentagon has contingency plans for 
everything white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said but 
would not elaborate 
four hundred mutinous scout rangers were operating in makati and 
400 other rebels still occupied mactan air base in cebu 350 miles 
south of manila 
brig gen jose commendador leader of mactan rebels said 
tuesday a nationwide uprising by the military would result if 
the government moved against them 
vice president salvador laurel said in a statement issued 
tuesday in hong kong resignation of the government would allow for 
a new mandate and avert civil war although still vice 
president laurel broke with mrs aquino in 1987 and formed an 
opposition party 
continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened public 
confidence

the justice department is conducting a 
preliminary inquiry on whether a special prosecutor should 
investigate allegations that former housing secretary samuel r 
pierce violated the law 
attorney general dick thornburgh disclosed late monday that he 
had ordered the preliminary inquiry into allegations submitted last 
month by 19 democrats on the house judiciary committee 
the department has 60 days to complete the preliminary inquiry 
thornburghs chief spokesman david runkel said it began saturday 
under the law the inquiry by the justice departments public 
integrity section must determine if there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that further investigation is warranted by special 
prosecutor known as an independent counsel 
thornburghs decision was forwarded to the house judiciary 
committee in a brief letter which was not released it was also 
filed under seal with a special division of the us circuit court 
of appeals for the district of columbia that appoints independent 
counsels and oversees their operation 
one of the lawmakers rep bruce morrison dconn praised the 
decision but suggested thornburgh launched the preliminary inquiry 
only after being prodded by congress 
there was no necessity of a judiciary committee request in 
order for the justice department to act morrison said they 
could well have done so on their own 
there is no indication that it wouldnt have happened without 
our initiative morrison said 
the procedure under the special prosecutor law was triggered 
nov 2 when morrison and 18 colleagues sent a letter to thornburgh 
requesting appointment of an independent counsel 
the lawmakers said congressional hearings on the scandal at the 
department of housing and urban development had uncovered evidence 
of a conspiracy by pierce and top aides to award grants based on 
political favoritism 
they also suggested there was evidence pierce lied under oath 
when he told the house government operations employment and housing 
subcommittee he did not have hands on involvement in awarding 
hud grants 
pierces lawyers who had expressed confidence last month that 
thornburgh would find no basis to proceed with a preliminary 
inquiry offered a similar response to the latest news about their 
client 
under the very low threshold the statute requires we arent 
surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken said 
robert plotkin one of pierces lawyers 
plotkin said he was confident that justice department 
prosecutors will find there is no basis for appointing an 
independent counsel 
but morrison said there was enough evidence generated by 
congressional hearings that justifies a careful look by an 
independent counsel 
rep charles schumer dny who with morrison led the call for 
an independent counsel said thornburghs decision is a move that 
should be welcomed by everyone including exsecretary pierce 
this investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers 
to questions that are not going away schumer said 
after receiving the lawmakers request last month thornburgh 
accused morrison and schumer of trying to inject partisan 
politics into this matter which has until now been handled on a 
nonpartisan professional way by the congress hud and this 
department 
even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that 
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations 
have been completed thornburgh said 
the attorney general bristled last week at a reporters 
suggestion that he might have trouble opening an investigation of 
pierce because the two men sat together on president reagans 
cabinet 
let me tell you this in this or any other case dick 
thornburgh is going to go where the evidence leads the attorney 
general said if the evidence is there we will take appropriate 
action if its not we wont

an undercover government survey shows more 
than half of allterrain vehicle dealers are at least partially 
violating an agreement with the justice department not to recommend 
adultsize atvs for children younger than 16 
the study released monday by the consumer product safety 
commission was criticized by a spokesman for american honda motor 
co one of the manufacturers involved in the 1988 consent 
agreement limiting atv sales 
this survey was based on undercover casual conversations with 
salesmen and did not involve a sales transaction said kirk 
antonius a spokesman for honda in los angeles 
we have a safeguard built into the sales process that requires 
the consumer to sign a document saying that he has seen and read 
all of the proper safety information and is aware of the age 
recommendations by the manufacturers 
antonius also criticized the timing of the release of the 
survey conducted in june 
this is more than a fivemonth delay in reporting this he 
said if they had given us this information five months ago it 
would have helped us in talking to the dealers to be sure that 
their sales representatives are doing their best job if there are 
some salesmen providing inappropriate age recommendations we would 
like to know about it and work with our dealers 
ken giles a spokesman for the commission said the survey was 
conducted by a contractor and received by the commission about 10 
days ago 
the commission said it based its conclusion on the undercover 
survey of 227 randomly selected atv dealers 
recommending use by children under 16 of adultsize atvs those 
with engines larger than 80 cubic centimeters is contrary to a 
consent decree agreed to in 1988 by the commission the justice 
department and five us atv distributors american honda motor co 
inc kawasaki motors corp usa american suzuki motor corp 
yamaha motor corp usa and polaris industries 
the decree requires atv distributors to use their best 
efforts to assure that dealers do not sell adultsize atvs for 
use by children under 16 
atvs are motorized machines that can traverse rough offroad 
terrain they range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters 
the commissions study was the second in six weeks to indicate 
widespread violation of the consent agreement 
on oct 23 the us public interest research group a private 
organization affiliated with consumer advocate ralph nader said 54 
percent of dealers it surveyed told volunteers who telephoned them 
that an adultsize vehicle would be appropriate for use by children 
under 16 that group surveyed 215 dealerships in california 
connecticut florida illinois maryland new jersey new mexico 
vermont and washington 
the commission said its undercover investigators asked dealers 
what atv would you recommend for my 13yearold boy 
it said about 56 per cent of the dealers answered in ways either 
partly or completely inconsistent with the age provisions of the 
consent decree almost 30 percent of them mentioned there are 
recommendations against selling big atvs to children but 
discounted the warning another 26 percent did not mention the 
agesize guidelines 
the commission said more than 100 children die each year riding 
adultsized atvs 
it said none of the dealers surveyed were selling threewheeled 
atvs which are banned by the consent decree

two irancontra prosecutors deny suggestions 
by john poindexter that they should not handle the case against the 
former national security adviser because they were tainted by his 
testimony on capitol hill under a grant of immunity 
poindexters lawyers say his highprofile testimony compelled by 
congress hopelessly compromised the governments case against their 
client 
however prosecutors dan webb and howard pearl said in court 
monday that they were busy with their careers during poindexters 
nationally televised appearances in july 1987 
i could not tell you if you held a gun to my head one single 
fact about poindexters testimony said at a pretrial hearing 
called by us district court judge harold greene to consider a 
defense motion that the indictment against poindexter be dismissed 
webb a former us attorney in chicago said he was aware 
poindexter was a highranking reagan administration official but 
didnt know he was the national security adviser 
pearl said he was absolutely sure he never watched the 
irancontra hearings because he was tied up at the us attorneys 
office in chicago handling a criminal investigation of sports 
agents 
both prosecutors hired within the past few months to handle the 
poindexter prosecution acknowledged they must have seen news 
accounts of the hearings 
greene took the matter under advisement oliver north is 
scheduled to testify when the pretrial hearing resumes dec 12 
a 1972 supreme court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use 
of a defendants testimony compelled under a grant of immunity 
poindexter testified under such a grant of immunity about a 1985 
arms shipment to iran 
poindexter is charged with one count of conspiracy two counts 
of obstructing congress and two counts of making false statements 
in the irancontra scandal his trial is scheduled to begin jan 22 
he is accused of trying to cover up norths involvement in the 
secret contra resupply effort and of trying to hide the fact that 
reagan administration officials knew about a 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran at the time it happened the hawks shipment was 
assisted by the cia without a signed presidential finding as 
required by law 
webb who was in private law practice during the congressional 
irancontra hearings said he recalled questions raised in the news 
media about whether president reagan had ordered subordinates to 
lie or obstruct congress 
webb said he also remembered questions about whether the 
president was involved in arms to iran for hostages and 
generally whether the president knew of the diversion of funds 
from the iran effort to the contra aid effort

the stone plaque calling the 
yasmina quarter the neighborhood of the two martyrs has not 
kept pace with the anger and bitterness built up in two years of 
the palestinian uprising 
the neighborhood of 6000 palestinians crowded into the old 
marketplace known as the casbah now has 14 martyrs men and 
teenage boys shot by israeli soldiers along the narrow streets 
yasmina has seen all the many sufferings and the few small 
triumphs of the intefadeh the uprising that began on dec 8 
1987 to demand israel end its occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
flagwaving demonstrations stones firebombs and the killing of 
suspected collaborators have been common in yasmina arabic for the 
fragrant jasmin flower 
the israeli response has been tear gas gunfire arrests the 
demolition of houses the latest example came dec 2 when soldiers 
shot to death four men blamed for killing fellow palestinians 
accused of collaborating with israel 
some palestinians and israelis question whether the uprising is 
losing its steam after two years of suffering with no real 
political gains but in yasmina the talk is of defiance revenge 
carrying on the battle for a palestinian state 
we dont want the blood of our sons to go for nothing 
replied yusra el masri 42 when asked if the revolt will persist 
on the wall opposite hangs a blurry enlargement of a family 
snapshot that shows her son bashar dead at age 20 
he was trying to throw two firebombs she said 
matteroffactly 
another son and a soninlaw are in jail accused of taking part 
in the uprising mrs el masri said she complained angrily of 
dozens of visits by israeli soldiers to question her other five 
sons 
pulling her youngest son 3yearold fuad close to her mrs 
masri said i hope he will grow up and avenge the death of his 
brother 
its uncertain how much the defiance expressed by mrs masri and 
others in yasmina is mere bravado one former nablus policeman 
long familiar with the casbah was asked if residents were not worn 
down by the long revolt 
they are tired of course but im not sure they admit it even 
to themselves he replied asking that his name not be used 
after two years there is reason for weariness the palestinian 
economy never welldeveloped has been further hurt by the 
threehour store hours and almost weekly general strikes ordered by 
the plobacked leaders of the uprising 
by army estimate more than 40000 palestinians have been 
arrested and at least 8900 injured in the uprising in the west 
bank and gaza palestinians say the numbers are higher 
in nablus with a population of about 100000 the death toll 
from israel is 66 in the past two years 
throughout the west bank and gaza where 17 million people 
live 625 palestinians have been killed by israelis at least 154 
others have been slain by fellow arabs as suspected collaborators 
fortythree israelis also have been killed 
scars of the violence are visible on sharea lulu street of the 
pearl where the el masri family lives near their home stands the 
wreckage of a house partly demolished by the army after a concrete 
block was dropped from its roof last february killing an israeli 
soldier binyamin meisner 24 
an israeli reservist who has served in nablus said the city 
holds both dangers and frustrations for soldiers 
the 29yearold corporal whose name could not be used under 
army regulations said patrolling the casbah means staying alert to 
every motion atop the two and threestory buildings 
at any moment you can have rocks or bottles all over you 
he said adding that troops also must constantly decide when they 
can open fire under regulations allowing use of live ammunition 
only if a soldiers life is in danger 
its a frustration youre a soldier with a weapon he said 
its a very difficult thing its spur of the moment 
despite the many deaths in nablus the soldier added the 
number of casualties is in line with the rules 
abed el sayeh whose 13yearold brother died in army gunfire 
last year has an understandably different view of soldiers rules 
here they shoot at anything that moves he said 
el sayeh lives on sharea lulu only steps from the memorial to 
the two martyrs his brother samir and a 14yearold neighbor 
khaled tubeleh 
the families of both can recite a litany of deaths injuries 
arrests and humiliations at the hands of israeli soldiers 
abed 21 said he has been jailed four times in the uprising 
another brother age 11 broke his arm falling from a roof as 
soldiers chased him the fiance of a 16yearold sister bahia was 
killed sept 2 in an army raid 
abed expects the stonethrowing and rioting to go on until the 
palestinian state is here and the palestinian flag is flying he 
hinted that guns may replace stones if the uprising fails to 
produce real results 
we are waiting for peace he said if theres no solution 
there are other means people here would be glad if it turned 
to armed struggle 
so far abed said the uprisings success has been in forging 
palestinian unity and focusing world attention on israels 
occupation 
israeli officials maintain however that palestinian unity is 
often maintained by fear 
lt gen dan shomron israels armed forces chief of staff said 
last week the armys task in nablus was stopping gangs of uprising 
enforcers who have been blamed for most of the deaths of 23 
supposed collaborators 
i would say our main effort is not directed against the 
general public but against the terror squads that are using force 
and pressure on the large groups of population in order to get them 
out on the streets he said 
a day later a 35yearold woman was shot to death as an alleged 
collaborator in the casbah nearby a reporter encountered several 
members of a gang called the black panthers including one man with 
a bulky bag he said held an m16 assault rifle 
another man said the group was ready to expand its activities to 
killing israelis if plo chairman yasser arafat ended his order to 
keep the uprising a revolution of stones 
this is the time for punishing collaborators when we have 
orders from arafat well finish the others said the man 
wearing a pendant in the colors of the palestinian flag 
eight days after he made that threat the man and his friend 
with the bulky bag were among four palestinians killed by soldiers 
outside a barber shop in the casbah

until two years ago the soviets jammed the 
voice of america and vilified it as an instrument of american 
propaganda 
until last year the us governments radio network couldnt 
get permission to station a correspondent in moscow 
now the voa is playing supersonic tag with mikhail gorbachev 
when gorbachev flew to malta for his summit with president bush 
the chase plane of journalists from moscow accredited by the 
kremlin to cover the event also carried voa moscow correspondent 
andre de nesnara 
de nesnara a russianspeaking american has been stationed in 
moscow for a year covering the fastpaced changes in the soviet 
union for the radio network that broadcasts more than 2000 hours 
weekly in 49 languages 
the crumbling order in eastern europe one of the prime regions 
targeted for more than 40 years by voa broadcasts has afforded the 
network undreamed of opportunities to report on a part of the world 
never before accessible to its correspondents but is has also 
forced changes in network thinking 
we came to the conclusion about two years ago that we had to 
be more compelling more interesting to compete with the 
increasingly free and lively programs by radio stations in eastern 
europe said sidney a davis voas programming director 
voa has aired roundtable satellite discussions between soviet 
and american experts as well as callin programs from the soviet 
union with listeners asking questions about economic medical and 
scientific issues 
we can offer them expertise their radio stations cant 
davis said 
but the fact remains that voa gets its money 180 million 
annually from the us government its editorials still reflect 
official policy 
while the editorials on the summit didnt tell voa listeners 
anything that bush himself didnt tell gorbachev at malta the 
language was blunter 
the united states contends nicaragua and cuba are shipping 
sovietmade arms to leftist guerrillas in el salvador to fight the 
usbacked government gorbachev said his government isnt 
involved and had been assured by the nicaraguan government that it 
has not shipped any weapons to the salvadoran rebels 
bush told reporters at the joint news conference with gorbachev 
that he and the soviet leader have a difference giving 
gorbachev the benefit of the doubt bush said i dont believe 
the sandinistas have told the truth to our soviet friends 
but a dec 1 voa opinion piece was more direct 
high levels of soviet aid to cuba and nicaragua help these 
countries to support subversion and destabilization in central 
america it said the soviet union should press cuba and 
nicaragua to curb such activities 
the soviet union also continues to pour massive amounts of 
heavy weapons into afghanistan these weapons are taking a terrible 
toll on civilians and help to keep in power a repressive communist 
regime 
transcripts of the broadcast reports as well as of the 
editorials were made available under a recently publicized policy 
of openness by voa 
the stations 1942 charter forbids it to disseminate its 
broadcasts within the united states to prevent the voa from being 
used by the administration to indoctrinate americans 
the law does allow american reporters and academics to review 
voa material but network officials say this access was not widely 
known until a recent case involving a lawsuit by nbc news president 
michael gartner 
gartner contends voa only began allowing access to its broadcast 
material after he filed suit against the networks parent agency 
the us information agency which argued that barring 
dissemination of usia material within the united states violates 
the first amendment 
a us district court in iowa last month dismissed gartners 
suit

vice president dan quayle says the soviet 
unions foreign policy is largely unchanged and he believes the 
soviets pursuit of their interests creates instability in other 
countries according to a report tuesday 
in remarks reflecting more apparent skepticism than president 
bush has shown about soviet intentions quayle said the soviets 
have very significant interests beyond their borders and those 
interests create instability 
i dont think theyve changed much in foreign policy quayle 
said in an interview with the washington post in tuesday editions 
we cannot count on the soviets out of the goodness of their 
hearts in alleviating those tensions for us 
but quayle said he viewed events in one area beyond the borders 
of the soviet union eastern europe as reflecting soviet domestic 
policy 
i get into debates on this with people in the administration 
who ask about eastern europe quayle was quoted as saying 
though soviet president mikhail gorbachev has been very helpful 
in spurring communist governments in eastern europe to reform i 
dont view that as a matter of foreign policy as much as domestic 
policy 
my viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the 
area of economics quayle said 
quayle said he hadnt seen any evidence of their slackening 
off aid to cuba and nicaragua 
on the summit meeting of president bush and gorbachev quayle 
said he thought a strategic arms agreement is something that 
could be achieved on the timetable agreed to by the two leaders 
bush told a news conference in brussels on monday the west 
stands at the threshold of a new era but he declined to endorse 
gorbachevs suggestion that the cold war is over that day hasnt 
arrived bush said

the antarctic ozone hole is closed for this 
year after the window allowing dangerous ultraviolet radiation to 
reach the earth was open at near record levels 
the hole actually a region of depleted ozone levels in the 
stratosphere over the south pole approached record levels in 
october the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said 
monday 
ozone levels in that region have returned to normal said walter 
komhyr of noaas air resources laboratory 
ozone in the upper atmosphere helps screen the earth from 
dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun scientists are 
concerned the hole over antarctica could endanger marine life in 
that region and if the depletion spreads cause increased skin 
cancer and other health problems 
scientists measure ozone in dobson units with a measurement of 
270 to 300 considered normal for the area over the antarctic 
when the ozone hole forms levels drop drastically setting a 
record at 125 dobson units in 1987 and falling to 135 units this 
year 
levels rebounded to 322 units by midnovember then declined 
somewhat and are now estimated at near 300 komhyr said in a 
telephone interview 
during the antarctic spring a band of winds encircles the 
continent preventing the air there from mixing with the atmosphere 
in other parts of the world 
during that period temperatures drop to minus 125 degrees 
fahrenheit and colder in the upper atmosphere creating a situation 
in which manmade chlorofluorocarbon chemicals can mix with and 
destroy the ozone those reactions cease later in the year when 
temperatures warm to minus 70 degrees or so and the winds break 
down allowing polar air to mix once again with air from other 
areas and thus restore ozone to more normal levels 
the breakup of the polar vortex winds has been occurring quite 
late in the last few years komhyr said compared with the 1960s 
and 1970s when it took place several weeks earlier the cause of 
the delay is not well understood he said 
the period of greatest ozone depletion this year extended from 
oct 6 to oct 9 komhyr said the depletion was nearly as deep as 
in 1987 but didnt last quite as long as that year he said

working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the 
country by a climate of persecution 
eileen rosin the sole representative of the los angelesbased 
medical aid for el salvador left the country monday after 
discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend 
neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it 
before dawn saturday 
for eight years medical aid has distributed money for 
prosthetic devices delivered donated medicines to hospitals and 
sent dozens of children to the united states for operations beyond 
the technical means of salvadoran hospitals 
ms rosin 35 had worked in el salvador for two years and left 
reluctantly for los angeles 
we had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the 
states i dont know what will happen to them now she said 
the united nations on friday said it will transfer its 
salvadoran offices to guatemala for lack of guarantees 
officials found equipment and furniture at the main un offices 
smashed following fighting last week around the building in the 
affluent neighborhood of escalon 
army troops had occupied the offices which administered unicef 
and refugee projects after un personnel were evacuated when 
un officials returned they found scrawled on the walls un 
equals fmln equals traitors 
the letters stand for farabundo marti national liberation front 
the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of 
the 10yearold civil war 
the usbacked government of rightist alfredo cristiani 
responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended 
constitutional guarantees 
hundreds of people have been detained since including two dozen 
foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups almost 
all the nonsalvadorans have been deported although some remain 
jailed facing charges 
foreigners who work with the poor are called 
internationalists and they are a favorite target of the right 
which accuses them of supporting revolution 
a flier signed salvadoran air force considered the most 
rightist branch of the armed forces was found strewn on city 
streets over the weekend 
with god reason and might we shall conquer it said 
salvadoran patriot you have every right to defend your life and 
your property if in order to do this you have to kill fmln 
terrorists and their internationalist allies do it 
we are in the catacombs there is no prospect for aboveground 
humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term said 
episcopalian rev luis serrano whose church has for years done 
social medical and educational work with displaced people and 
refugees 
he commented in an interview in mariona prison where he and 
eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said the crackdown by 
the government and armed forces was absolutely appropriate 
washington has provided 4 billion in aid this decade to the 
salvadoran government in the war which has killed 71000 people 
1000 of them in the latest fighting 
us ambassador william walker likened the raids and arrests to 
the internment of japaneseamericans during world war ii 
im not condoning it but in times like these of great emotion 
and great anger things like this happen even in the us with 
all its guarantees it happened walker said 
there are a series of indications of a climate of 
persecution said monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary 
bishop of san salvador after mass on sunday not only against 
personnel of the catholic church but against many people who try 
to help the most humble and the most poor 
it appears that the military authorities in their quest to 
restore order have adopted as their criteria the saying think 
the worst and youll be right he said 
the climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes one goes like 
this 
two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the 
beginning of the nightly curfew they pass a man walking quickly in 
the opposite direction one soldier turns around and fatally shoots 
the man 
whyd you do that asks his companion 
i know that guy he lives 20 minutes from here

national drug director william j bennett and 
budget director richard darman are apart by more than a couple of 
hundred million dollars on spending to fight drugs in 1991 and 
president bush may settle the dispute an administration official 
says 
its a big enough gap that its likely to have to go to the 
president said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the recently approved antidrug budget for the 1990 fiscal year 
totaled 88 billion which congress had boosted by 900 million 
over bushs request of 79 billion 
id expect to see a real increase in 1991 not just an 
adjustment for inflation the official said in an interview monday 
but how much has not been determined said the source who 
refused to provide details on how much is being sought by bennett 
director of the office of national drug control policy and how 
much is sought by darman director of the office of management and 
budget 
bennett and darman are apart by more than couple of hundred 
million dollars the official said it may end up going to the 
president to get things sorted out hard to know when 
bennett spokesman don hamilton said this is the time of year 
when lots of agency heads and cabinet secretaries are talking to 
darman occasionally in strong terms 
meanwhile bennetts office is continuing work on what is being 
referred to among officials as strategy two the update on the 
national drug control strategy bush presented sept 5 the update 
like the original strategy was required by congress 
hamilton said the updated strategy will add detail to some 
areas focus on several antidrug plans being employed around the 
country that are working and will get into specifics on proposed 
budgets 
expected to be included are the designations of cities or areas 
considered highintensity drug trafficking areas that would be 
eligible for additional federal resources both in money and 
personnel 
published reports have said the areas to be designated in the 
upcoming strategy are los angeles new york miami houston and the 
southwest border but officials in bennetts office say no final 
decisions have been made 
the conversations in reference to highintensity drug 
trafficking areas are still ongoing said reggie walton the drug 
offices associate director for state and local affairs 
i have thoughts in my mind what areas stand at the top of the 
list said walton who took the lead on determining the criteria 
for designating the targeted areas 
in the current fiscal year only 25 million total has been 
allocated from the federal budget for such areas but that could 
increase by 20 million to 21 million with money coming out of the 
federal asset forfeiture fund walton said that fund contains 
revenue from assets seized from drug traffickers 
the second administration official said even the higher amount 
is not that much money to begin with los angeles spent 2 
billion in the drug war in la county were looking at dividing 
this money up among four five six seven areas what can you do 
with this money obviously well be looking at more money later 
walton would not say how much money he would seek in the 1991 
budget for the highintensity drug trafficking areas 
the federal effort to crack down on drugs in the nations 
capital alone will cost about 97 million bennett has said 
however that includes money for three drug treatment centers and a 
new jail for the district of columbia still in the planning stages 
walton said some places designated as highintensity drug 
trafficking areas could get computers to enhance targeting of 
moneylaundering operations while others may need more prosecutors 
or law enforcement agents

five families who live without electricity 
near ted turners 8100acre plantation say they want the 
broadcasting executive to allow power lines to cross his property 
to their homes 
dressie sloan with the jefferson county national association 
for the advancement of colored people accused turner of trying to 
get rid of his poor neighbors by refusing to extend the electric 
lines 
one word from mr turner and theyd have their lights 
sloan told the tallahassee democrat sunday he has the power and 
the money to do it but he wants to squeeze them out 
but avalon plantation manager george purvis said turner was only 
complying with a former owners restrictions 
mr turner has never tried to get those people to move out 
purvis told the newspaper but mrs alexandra mckay thought an 
aboveground wire would destroy the national beauty of her land 
dee woods turners personal assistant in atlanta said he was 
unavailable to answer sloans complaint 
about a mile through the woods from the plantation frances 
oliver has lived in one of the three tarpapercovered shacks for 30 
years 
we used to have a school out here a church and maybe a couple 
hundred people she said about a dozen people now live on almost 
215 acres surrounded by tree farms hunting clubs and plantation 
forest 
ms oliver said she relies on a wood stove for cooking and 
heating she totes water from a plantation well and reads by a 
kerosene lamp car batteries run her tv set 
electricity would be nice ms oliver said maybe it would 
bring the people back she said 
but even if turner did approve the extension purvis said he 
wondered who would foot the bill a power line from the 
plantations terminal to the houses would cost at least 40000 
according to ronald bass a manager for tricounty electric 
cooperative 
state law gives people the right to draw power from a utility 
company but since tricounty is a rural coop it operates under 
federal guidelines and does not have to install the lines free of 
charge

top democratic congressional budget writers 
agree with president bushs warning that a proposed trimming of the 
pentagons budget wont produce a peace dividend for domestic 
programs 
liberals and other lawmakers hope the easing of cold war 
tensions will translate into a siphoning of defense money into 
health education transportation and other domestic needs 
defense secretary dick cheney is studying plans to pare up to 
180 billion from anticipated military spending increases through 
1994 the administration says its still trying to decide what the 
size and shape of the cuts will be 
but the chairmen of congress two budget committees expressed 
caution monday for those who hope the reductions will mean a 
windfall for other government initiatives 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said his 
analysis of defense reductions under study by the administration is 
that savings of just 2 billion are likely next year 
over five years military spending would still increase by 200 
billion excluding the effects of inflation he said 
clearly there is no socalled peace dividend said sasser 
whose figures were based on pentagon plans and economic projections 
announced earlier this year 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said there are still too many unknowns to predict 
whether domestic programs will benefit from defense cuts bush is 
expected to propose 
panetta said there are questions about the types of savings he 
will seek whether aid will be sought to offset economic 
dislocations caused by closed bases and weapons plants and how 
much of the cutbacks would go to deficit reduction 
i have always been very cautious about arguing for a defense 
dividend he said 
liberal lawmakers argue that with better ussoviet relations 
its time to shrink the defense budget which comprises about 
onefourth of the governments 12 trillion annual spending 
the more you cut from the military the less damage you do to 
domestic programs to meet grammrudman targets rep barney 
frank dmass said monday 
frank has been a leader of a group of liberals pressing 
congressional leaders to slash about 20 billion from the pentagon 
budget and redistribute most of it among health housing education 
and other domestic programs 
bush speaking monday to reporters at a brussels belgium news 
conference after his summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev tried to douse those hopes 
we have a lot of demands at home and theres no question 
about that bush said but i think it is premature to speak as 
some are at home about a peace dividend take a lot of money out 
of defense and put it into other worthy causes 
the president cited the problems the government will have in 
scraping together enough savings to meet the grammrudman 
deficitreduction laws requirement of a fiscal 1991 shortfall of 
no more than 64 billion 
the administration is expected to forecast a deficit for fiscal 
1990 which ends sept 30 of about 110 billion bush will submit 
his proposed 1991 budget to congress on jan 22 
there just isnt a lot of quote excess money unquote 
floating around there bush said 
the cuts cheney is considering would be made from increases 
already projected thus rather than reducing military spending 
totals they are widely expected on capitol hill to leave defense 
department outlays near the current level of about 290 billion 
since 1986 military spending has decreased by an average of 3 
percent annually when inflation is taken into account even though 
the actual amount going to the pentagon has increased each year 
defense department outlays 265 billion in 1986 should reach 287 
billion this year 
defense spending is difficult to shrink quickly because much of 
it such as purchases of fleets of jet fighters is committed in 
contracts that span several years even reducing numbers of troops 
has offsetting costs such as higher civilian unemployment rates 
the conventional wisdom among lawmakers and lobbyists is that 
the 1991 defense department budget is unlikely to contain 
reductions of more than 3 billion to 8 billion from the increases 
that were already planned for the year

molten rock moving beneath californias 
mammoth mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small 
earthquakes since may but the us geological survey says the old 
volcano is unlikely to erupt 
we still see occasional bursts of quake activity but its 
much more sporadic in recent weeks than in june when hundreds of 
tiny jolts each day rattled the 11053foot mountain in the sierra 
nevada said usgs geophysicist dave hill the scientist in charge 
of monitoring the situation 
in a statement issued monday the federal agency said while 
eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm 
cannot be ruled out observations at many volcanoes in the world 
suggest the most likely outcome is a return to an extended 
period of relative quiescence 
hill discussed the swarm of quakes under mammoth mountain 
during a monday session at the american geophysical unions fall 
meeting 
only four of the thousands of quakes that started may 4 measured 
more than 3 on the richter scale so most were too small to be 
felt some of the quakes were only 15 miles deep and often came in 
rapidfire bursts 
mammoth mountain has bulged upward about onehalf inch since 
may hill said 
the most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that 
molten rock or magma is being squeezed into a vertical crack that 
extends from 35 miles to 6 miles below mammoth mountains south 
flank he said 
this sheetlike intrusion is called a dike and excavations at 
many old volcanoes reveal that most dikes never erupt to the 
surface hill explained 
mammoth mountain now covered with ski runs last erupted 
explosively about 50000 years ago and is located just outside the 
southwest rim of long valley caldera the caldera is a 
20by10mile ovalshaped crater created 730000 years ago by one 
of the worlds greatest eruptions 
that blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the may 
18 1980 eruption of mount st helens 
the resort town of mammoth lakes sits inside the caldera a few 
miles east of mammoth mountain hill cautioned against undue 
volcano phobia saying it is more dangerous to drive up on us 
395 than to spend time skiing or living near mammoth lakes

kanamori mori and their colleagues found that the shuttles 
characteristic twin sonic booms thumped 400 highrise buildings in 
downtown los angeles and the nearby wilshire district when columbia 
swept northeast over the city at 2600 mph before landing at 
edwards air force base the base is about 80 miles north of los 
angeles 
the early morning booms prompted dozens of alarmed calls to 
police the shuttle was returning from a fiveday mission to deploy 
a spy satellite 
the thumps against the buildings were transmitted down to the 
soft sediment of the los angeles basin triggering seismic waves 
that reached caltech instruments 125 seconds before the sonic 
booms were heard there thats because waves move more quickly 
through rock than through air 
the scientists learned from the data that the soft 
125miledeep sediment beneath los angeles amplifies the effects 
of slow swaying longperiod quake waves with a period or 
time between wave crests of 2 to 3 seconds shortperiod waves 
cause sharp jolts 
buildings 20 to 30 stories tall tend to sway back and forth once 
every 2 to 3 seconds making it possible that in an earthquake 
the los angeles basin would preferentially amplify ground motion 
giving 20 to 30story buildings more shaking than if they were 
founded on solid rock caltech said in a news release 
kanamori and mori estimated buildings on the sediment would 
shake three to five times worse than those on solid rock thats 
less severe than the tenfold and greater amplification of shaking 
during the great quakes of 1985 in mexico city which rests on an 
old lake bed 
henry koza a structural engineer at eqe engineering in los 
angeles said skyscrapers are designed and built to pretty strict 
criteria theres so much inherent flexibility in high rises 
they can accommodate significant motion 
i dont think those buildings are going to fall down said 
egill hauksson a university of southern california seismologist 
probably the engineers are right in that they have designed these 
buildings with some overestimates of what the shaking might be to 
make sure the buildings are safe 
but kanamori said my feeling is these effects have not been 
really evaluated very carefully and very quantitatively 
robert harder assistant chief of the citys building bureau 
said the city requires buildings taller than 160 feet to be 
designed using computersimulated quakes to test loads stresses 
and swaying 
we feel our requirements in the city are adequate they go way 
beyond what other agencies have required harder said 
scientists for years have said a magnitude65 quake in or near 
los angeles would be as bad or worse than the muchfeared 
magnitude8 big one on the more distant san andreas fault 
kanamori and mori conducted the study with caltech geophysicist 
don anderson and usgs seismologists tom heaton and lucile jones

the senate panel studying the blast aboard the 
uss iowa that killed 47 sailors last april will hear testimony next 
monday from the skipper of the battleship 
capt fred p moosally will answer questions at the panels 
second hearing it was announced monday the committee heard 
testimony last month from rear adm richard milligan who oversaw 
the navys technical and criminal investigation of the blast 
the navy concluded in its sept 7 report that gunners mate 
clayton hartwig most likely caused the explosion by inserting 
some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the 
ships 16inch guns hartwig was among those killed 
milligan told the committee that additional technical tests 
conducted since the report found unique foreign material that 
would not have been present during a normal firing

two daily newspapers in las vegas could 
combine commercial and production facilities but continue 
publishing separate editions under a plan that has been recommended 
by the justice departments antitrust division 
assistant attorney general james f rill recommended monday that 
the las vegas sun and the las vegas review journal be allowed to 
make the partial merger under a joint operating agreement 
rill found that because of circulation and advertising losses 
the las vegas sun was in probable danger of financial failure 
and therefore qualified for the antitrust exemption granted by the 
newspaper preservation act 
attorney general dick thornburgh must make the final decision 
whether to allow the proposed joint operating agreement to proceed

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
predicts that random drug tests for those responsible for 
transportation on land sea and air will show an alarming 
amount of drug use among the workers 
rules begin going into effect in two weeks that require random 
and other drug tests for millions of airline railroad mass 
transit bus company boat trucking company and pipeline employees 
skinner said monday that where court orders do not stop the 
testing companies must comply with the new rule several suits 
have been filed by workers to stop the federally imposed program 
startup dates for the testing vary by modes of transportation 
the secretary said he has set up a group in his office to

telephone workers returning to work after a 
14week strike faced a huge backlog of requests for installation 
service and other work 
everybodys now back to work we are delighted to see them 
all the priority is attacking this backlog nynex corp 
spokesman john bonomo said monday 
the strike by about 40000 members of the communications workers 
of america employed by nynex subsidiary new york telephone and 
20000 members of the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers at new england telephone affected 10 million customers 
it began aug 6 and was the last of four regional phone company 
strikes to be resolved the ibew and new england telephone did not 
settle until nov 20 the cwa ratified its contract friday 
new york telephone said it was trying to fill more than 100000 
service orders and a potential backlog of another 150000 
installations with customers who withheld orders during the work 
stoppage 
filling those orders will take until may the company said 
repair work it said is up to date 
during the strike some 10000 managers filled in for striking 
workers one striker was killed in a strikerelated car accident

the uss iowa sails into port this week with 
the controversy over an explosion that killed 47 sailors no more 
settled than when the battleship set sail six months ago 
the iowa was in the mediterranean when the navy released a 
report saying a disgruntled gunners mate who died in the april 19 
blast sabotaged one of the warships massive 16inch guns 
but the navy report has been widely criticized by relatives of 
the victims and military watchdog groups and intensely scrutinized 
by congress 
the house armed services subcommittee is holding hearings on the 
report next week and the senate armed services committee next week 
will get testimony from capt fred p moosally the iowas 
commander the general accounting office is reviewing the navys 
findings 
the iowa is due in port later this week probably thursday 
according to officials 
the navy said the explosion was most probably caused by an 
intentional act and the most likely person with the access 
knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish this act has been 
identified as gunners mate 2nd class clayton hartwig 
the navy said the 24yearold hartwig of cleveland was 
suicidal and that he placed a detonating device between sacks of 
gun propellant in the middle gun of the threegun turret and 
triggered the device 
i think that conclusion must be in the guiness book of world 
records for the longest standing leap from conjecture to an 
unsupportable conclusion said retired rear adm eugene carroll 
executive director of the center of defense information in 
washington dc and a frequent navy critic 
kreig brusnahan a cleveland attorney representing hartwigs 
family said congressional hearings will show incompetency and bias 
in the navys report 
the navy is still engaged in a coverup every action taken 
is designed to find human error instead of the truth said ellis 
rubin a miami attorney representing kendall truitt one of the 
survivors of the explosion 
lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman at the pentagon said 
the service stands behind the report as unbiased factual and 
correct 
both carroll and brusnahan point out that the navy also 
documented numerous administrative and training irregularities 
aboard the battleship the navy concluded that none of those 
deficiencies contributed to the explosion 
carroll said the navy made that judgment for a selfserving 
reason 
my reasoning is that the big issue is should we have an 
iowa should we spend the money and men to operate a 45yearold 
ship with obsolete equipment equipment that has failed in the 
past they diverted attention away from the question of the iowa 
he said 
critics also pointed to tests done by the federal bureau of 
investigation that found no trace of a detonating device the navy 
said its experts and equipment were superior to the fbis 
sailors families were upset by leaks from the navy during a 
naval investigative service probe into hartwigs background the 
leaked reports claimed that a lapsed relationship between hartwig 
and another gunners mate kendall truitt motivated hartwig in his 
suicidal tendencies the final navy report said there was no 
substance to the allegations about the relationship 
the way i see the investigation the navy took 20 days to 
determine it was not an accident then spent the rest of their time 
to build their case against clay said nancy lewis whose 
23yearold son richard died in the explosion i dont believe 
clayton did this

with his wife showing signs of progress after 
the worlds first heart liver and kidney transplant john martin 
was on the telephone in a delicate conversation on the line was 
the husband of the donor 
the talk was brief said dimitri mavris whose wife 26yearold 
auli died from injuries suffered in a freak automobile accident 
auli mavris organs were transplanted into 26yearold cindy martin 
in pittsburgh on monday 
he said you have given us a great gift and i said she 
would have wanted it that way our prayers are with you and your 
wife mavris said 
mrs mavris was killed after being struck by a car driven by a 
neighbor in a parking lot by her apartment in atlanta when she was 
taking a load of trash to a bin 
mrs martin remained in critical condition considered normal 
after transplant surgery in presbyterianuniversity hospitals 
intensive care unit doctors said monday they were encouraged by 
her progress and planned to wean her from a respirator they said 
infection had become her greatest risk 
hopefully she will go home in three or four weeks said dr 
john armitage who performed the heart transplant right now her 
organ function looks encouraging shes awake and writing us 
notes 
although multiorgan transplants have been done before this was 
the first involving the heart liver and a kidney armitage said 
three other people have received combination heartliver 
transplants but only stormie jones a 12yearold texas girl who 
received her new organs in february 1984 has survived the 
procedure 
the 21hour operation which ended at 5 pm sunday was broken 
into three parts with the heart transplanted first the liver 
second and the kidney last 
her greatest need was for improved circulation and treatment 
of her failed heart that was addressed first armitage said 
her kidneys although bad were the least of her multiorgan 
system failure 
in chicago the recipient of the nations first livingdonor 
liver transplant 22monthold alyssa smith was in serious but 
stable condition university of chicago hospitals spokeswoman mary 
fetsch said today doctors are pleased with her progress eight days 
after the procedure the spokeswoman said she has been moved out 
of intensive care to a private room and shows no signs of rejecting 
the liver 
her mother teresa who donated a piece of her liver for the 
operation was in good condition and expected to be released from 
the hospital this week ms fetsch said 
mrs martin suffers from familial cardiomyopathy an inherited 
heart disease her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on 
his side of the family have died young martin said 
on oct 20 1985 one day after the couple were married mrs 
martin was admitted to presbyterianuniversity hospital to await 
her first heart transplant she received it nov 6 
since then she has suffered from chronic rejection of the heart 
and developed hepatits and kidney dysfunction 
martin 28 said at a news conference that hes been telling his 
wife to hang in there and hope that our lives are finally going 
to turn around 
mrs martin had to give up her secretarial job and has spent 
most of her time at home in archbald doing only light household 
chores because she tired easily and developed several infections 
said her husband a manufacturing engineer 
armitage said ethical questions of retransplantation despite 
the shortage of donor organs was not a major consideration in 
mrs martins case 
she is a very young patient he said we were very 
committed to her

the army is searching for an automatic 
rifle to replace the m16 which soldiers have used since the 
vietnam war 
the goal is to develop a weapon that will make the 21st century 
soldier twice as effective at wounding or killing enemy troops 
overcoming battlefield stress and unpredictable targets 
the m16a2 is the finest combat rifle in the world but the 
accuracy of that weapon because of human factors is not as high as 
one would like it to be said pete rowland public affairs 
officer for the armys armament research development and 
engineering center at picatinny arsenal nj 
since september 36 army and air force shooters have been 
conducting preliminary tests with four advanced combat rifle 
prototypes at fort benning 
the army has spent about 40 million since 1982 on research and 
development and expects to spend another 17 million by 1991 when 
officials decide what technology to pursue 
the prototypes were submitted by colt industries of hartford 
conn steyrdaimlerpuch of steyr austria aai corp of hunt 
valley md and heckler amp koch a german firm with a us 
subsidiary in chantilly va 
the colt rifle fires conventional ammunition or a duplex 
cartridge with two projectiles colt claims one projectile travels 
to the point of aim and the other diverges slightly to increase hit 
probability 
the steyr uses a plasticcased cartridge that fires a steel 
flechette or dart the aai rifle fires a brass cartridge with a 
flechette and the heckler amp koch a bullet from a caseless 
cartridge made of molded propellant 
rowland said the army is trying to develop a rifle that fires 
lightweight lowcost ammunition 
the soldier of today is weightily equipped he said 
anything that can be done to make that lighter and a lot is 
being done will increase his effectiveness probably from head to 
foot the army is looking for a way to lighten the load 
the m16 already is lighter than the sovietdesigned ak47 but 
that assault rifle has the reputation of being more durable on the 
dirty battlefield than the m16 the m16 typically takes smaller 
ammunition than the ak and most other assault rifles 
in battle the soldiers shooting skills are hampered by a 
variety of factors such as stress fatigue weather conditions and 
obscured targets rowland noted 
the goal is to develop some compensations in the weapon to 
offset the outside factors that affect a soldier in battle he 
added the soldier has to have twice the accuracy that he has 
with the current version 
earlier this year the army conducted extensive engineering and 
safety tests on the prototypes at aberdeen proving ground md 
the army has scheduled a media briefing and demonstration of the 
weapons dec 13 at fort benning in january another team of army 
and air force shooters will arrive at benning to begin another 
three months of testing 
bill harris a media relations specialist at picatinny arsenal 
said there is no timetable for phasing out the m16 
since the m16 is over 20 years old now the defense 
department has decided to look at new technology he said the 
average life of a military rifle is 20 to 30 years going back to 
the flintlocks used in the revolutionary war if we find a 
technology that meets the needs of doubling the effectiveness of 
the m16 then we could have a new weapon in the hands of 
troops as early as 1995 
the m16 was first issued to us troops in 1967 during the 
vietnam war it was criticized for jamming the problem was 
corrected by using a different type of gunpower in the rifles 
556mm ammunition the latest version known as the m16a2 was 
introduced in 1987 it has a maximum effective range of 550 meters 
and is more accurate and reliable than the earlier versions harris 
said 
the m16 is a very reliable weapon he added its 
considered one of the best combat rifles in the world

the only newspaper of the amish and 
mennonites is owned by a jewish family edited by a lutheran and 
has its readers double as unpaid reporters 
butter churning recipes and buggy accidents are among the 
subjects that fill the pages of the budget which is gearing up for 
its 100th anniversary as what may be the most widely circulated 
smalltown newspaper in the country 
george smith 82 has worked at the newspaper in this tuscarawas 
county village of 2000 in eastern ohio since his father bought the 
paper in 1920 there are no amish and two mennonites on the staff 
one problem with amish girls is they work a couple of years 
then get married said smith as for the amish men its not 
their kind of work 
smith supervises the 600 or so scribes who send in 
handwritten items of parochial interest from amish and mennonite 
settlements in such places as charm ohio macon miss sarasota 
fla and intercourse pa smith whose title is associate editor 
although there is no editor also lays out the pages 
smith who became editor and publisher in 1936 sold the paper 
to two employees in 1974 when they left albert spector of wooster 
bought the paper in 1981 
spector who is jewish owns spectors stores a major 
advertiser in the budget and supplier of dry goods to the amish and 
mennonites 
every week the paper receives as many as 400 letters from the 
scattered communities describing births marriages buggy accidents 
and the weather 
there are two editions one serving sugarcreek and surrounding 
areas and the national edition which carries more than 300 letters 
from plain people settlements in the lower 48 states and more than 
a dozen foreign countries 
a special 100th anniversary edition will be sent to the budgets 
18000 subscribers in may smith is planning a summer party for all 
his correspondents 
smith said he edits the letters for spelling punctuation and 
clarity but we like to keep the flavor 
for instance an amish from stockport ohio had this 
butterchurning tale floyd beechy rigged a plastic crate on the 
center of the buggy wheel in this he fastened a plastic jug of 
cream as he or the mrs had to drive the scholars to school every 
day this saved churning at home now they have 2 girls at home and 
probably dont churn anymore 
from guys mills pa james a miller is laid up with a torn 
ligament in back of his leg and internal bleeding this happened 
while chasing heifers 
and from jamesport mo it seems the postal service is 
getting slack again for quite awhile we received the budget on 
sat but lately it doesnt come till mon 
reports of violent crime are rare because occurrences are rare 
smith said 
we try to avoid anything about crime we dont feel it has a 
place in the budget unless it really directly involves the 
amish 
the paper has grown from four pages to 30 or more since its 
first edition and production has been modernized the budget is now 
on its third computer system complete with laser printer and some 
mennonite letters arrive by fax 
the budget scribes are not paid but good writers receive 
stamped envelopes to mail in stories if theyre really good they 
get free subscriptions 
there are no photographs in the national edition as the amish 
shun having their pictures taken recipes as well as display and 
classified ads are included 
surgarcreek is surrounded by the largest settlement of amish in 
the world with 20000 to 25000 living in holmes wayne coshoctan 
and tuscarawas counties in ohio about 100000 amish people live in 
the united states figures on the mennonite population were 
unavailable

the federal government today said it 
plans to outlaw cigarette advertising in the print media in an 
attempt to slash the 2 billion a year spent on health care for 
smokers 
it reflects the concern that tobacco consumption is the major 
preventable cause of illness in the australian community today 
health minister neal blewett said in announcing the decision 
the government has a clear responsibility to act to discourage 
australians from smoking and particularly to reduce pressures on 
young people to take up smoking 
advertising of tobacco products has been banned in the 
electronic media since 1976 
blewett said the government would amend the smoking and tobacco 
products advertisements bill to legislate the ban on advertising in 
newspapers and magazines 
he said there was sufficient evidence of a link between tobacco 
advertising and the taking up of smoking to justify the 
governments decision on strong public health grounds 
although advertising is not the only determinant in peoples 
decision to smoke research has established that it does affect and 
reinforce other influences such as peer and social pressures 
blewett said 
the ban will bring australia into line with many other countries 
that have outlawed tobacco advertising including canada norway 
finland italy portugal singapore and iceland 
blewett noted that research in norway had shown substantial 
falls in smoking among adolescents since a ban took effect in 
that country in 1975 
sports minister graham richardson said earlier he opposed a 
total ban on tobacco advertising because some sports relied heavily 
on tobacco sponsorship 
he said that sport received about 16 million a year from 
tobacco companies in australia and that replacement sponsorships of 
that size would be difficult

the district of columbia police department has 
concluded its officers acted properly in handling allegations that 
mayor marion barry was hospitalized for a drug overdose six years 
ago a newspaper reported today 
police chief isaac fulwood believes the department and 
thenchief maurice turner were right to drop the matter after the 
allegation could not be corroborated sources told the washington 
post 
a howard university psychiatrist reportedly told police 
investigators in 1984 that the mayor suffered from a drug overdose 
in 1983 
barry in an effort monday to quell the overdose allegations 
let reporters review 154 pages of medical records but the records 
were withdrawn after an hour and many reporters complained it was 
impossible to draw conclusions from them 
barrys spokeswoman said the records were released to 
substantiate the mayors statements that he suffered from a hiatal 
hernia in 1983 and not a cocaine overdose 
the records indicated that doctors diagnosed barrys illness as 
a hiatal hernia an abnormality of the digestive tract that can 
cause symptoms similar to those of a heart attack 
none of the records showed that barry was tested for the 
presence of cocaine or that illegal drugs caused his 
hospitalization 
medical experts told the post the symptoms identified in barrys 
records were consistent with several illnesses including a hiatal 
hernia heart disease and a cocaine overdose

a woman who was subjected as a child to josef 
mengeles notorious experiments on twins said the nazi medical data 
gathered from her suffering should never be used in scientific 
research 
eva mozes kor told her story monday at a boston university 
conference on nazi doctors and parallels in modern medicine some 
in the audience of about 300 people weeped and when she finished 
many stood and cheered her 
im hurt by scientists who say we should use nazi data kor 
said i feel the victims have paid with lifelong suffering 
no one should benefit from brutal crimes said kor a 
hungarian jew and president of candles which stands for children 
of auschwitz nazi deadly lab experiments 
some biomedical ethicists contend that the issue is moot 
because nazi research already has been cited in american and 
british journals they argue that the data despite its source 
have the potential to save human life 
benjamin freedman an associate professor at the mcgill center 
for medicine ethics and law was scheduled today to present a 
defense of using data from nazi experiments 
kors recollection of her experiences at the auschwitzbirkenau 
concentration camp in occupied poland during world war ii was one 
of the most dramatic at the symposium 
the 54yearold terre haute ind resident said the trauma of 
the camps has never left her in 1987 she donated a kidney to her 
identical twin sister miriam whose kidneys seriously deteriorated 
over the years as a result of neardeadly injections given them in 
the camps 
they were nine years old when taken prisoner 
kor her parents two older sisters and her twin arrived by 
packed train at auschwitz in april 1944 she remembers her mother 
clutching her hand and her sisters hand when they were shoved off 
the train onto a platform her father and two older sisters 
disappeared into the crowd and were never heard from again 
kor said a member of the ss yelled in german for twins and 
pulled her and her sister in one direction on the platform kor 
looked back and saw her mother being dragged away arms 
outstretched toward the twins and crying 
the sisters were taken to the special barracks for twin girls 
aged 18 months to 12 years where they began a grim routine that 
lasted until the camp was liberated on jan 27 1945 about 3600 
twins were tested at the camp 
nothing on earth can prepare you for auschwitz said kor 
it is hell on earth 
three days a week for nine hours at a time kor and her sister 
stood naked with a dozen other sets of twins in a laboratory where 
nazi doctors prodded poked and examined them in every detail 
three times a week the twins were taken to another laboratory 
where blood samples were taken from kors right arm and her left

the state banned the sale or manufacture 
of eight handguns and at least 100 others also will be prohibited 
because their manufacturers did not submit them for approval 
officials said 
the maryland handgun roster board a ninemember panel has been 
working for about a year to compile a list of handguns that meet 
the criteria of a law passed last year aimed at banning socalled 
saturday night specials the cheap small lowcaliber weapons 
popular among criminals 
some people said this law would ban all guns in the state of 
maryland but that has not occurred state police chief elmer 
tippett said monday we banned some today and we approved a large 
number 
weapons makers were asked to submit their guns for the boards 
approval tippett who headed the panel estimated that at least 
100 guns were not considered because manufacturers failed to submit 
them 
i believe maryland will be a safer place to live because we 
have taken the time to consider these guns and their use gov 
william donald schaefer said 
the board judged the quality of manufacture concealability 
weight size safety features and intended use the ban goes into 
effect jan 1 though manufacturers who did not submit their guns 
to the board may do so at a later date the list of legal guns 
includes more than 600 weapons 
despite the national rifle assocations cries of wolf we can 
all clearly see that lawabiding citizens in maryland will still be 
able to purchase legitimate handguns said sarah brady wife of 
former white house press secretary james brady who was shot and 
severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against former 
president reagan 
mrs brady is chairwoman of handgun control inc a national 
group that lobbied for passage of the state law 
rafael fiol chairman of the state national rifle association 
said he disapproved of the boards work 
i dont think there should be any restriction on lawabiding 
citizens owning guns he said 
manufacturers who violate the law can be fined up to 10000 per 
gun and dealers who sell banned guns could be fined up to 2500 
per gun sold and could lose their license 
among the 100 or more weapons banned because their makers did 
not submit them were three of the five guns considered the most 
popular by criminals according to statistics from the federal 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the three guns are the mp25 a 25caliber semiautomatic 
pistol made by raven arms in california the j22 a semiautomatic 
pistol manufactured by jennings firearms of california and the 
tec9 a 9mm assault pistol made by the florida manufacturer 
intratec 
the eight handguns considered and banned by the roster board 
included the american derringer corps model 1 44 magnum and 
model 11 38 special the lorcin 25 caliber semiautomatic model 
l25 seecamps lws 32 and 25 precision small parts psp25 and

a judge has ruled that a longtime heroin 
user can spend two years in a zen buddhist monastery in new york 
rather than the five years in prison he was sentenced to earlier 
this year 
loudoun county circuit judge james h chamblin who issued the 
ruling monday said keith brian scofields jail term would be 
retained until he completes the twoyear program at a monastery in 
sullivan county ny in the catskills mountains 
scofield 30 described himself as a drug addict desperate to 
fill a spiritual void in his life 
the sterling va resident was arrested for possession of 
heroin in august 1987 convicted in november 1988 and released on 
probation after a june 1989 arrest on a minor charge chamblin 
gave him the fiveyear sentence 
acting abbot junpo dennis kelly who will be legally responsible 
for scofield while he is at the monastery said life here is very 
strict with the daily regimen including chants in four languages 
beginning at 5 am 
scofield told the washington post he has entered five drug 
rehabilitation programs completed three and feared he would 
relapse back to the same meaninglessness and addiction without 
a highly structured program of spiritual therapy this is not 
something im doing to dodge time he said

a dispute about liability insurance that kept a 1 
million stateoftheart bomb detector sitting in a crate at the 
miami airport has been resolved with the manufacturer agreeing to 
absorb the cost 
pan american world airways had worried that the thermal neutron 
analysis device only the second of its kind could leak 
radiation spawning costly lawsuits 
we have reached an agreement but im not going to be specific 
to what the agreement entails pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
said monday it does provide the protection that we felt we 
needed the liability insurance 
the machine can detect plastic explosives in checked baggage 
current xray equipment is incapable of sensing bombs like the one 
believed to have downed a pan am jumbo jet over lockerbie scotand 
in december 1988 killing 270 people 
the faa bought the new device and delivered it in august to 
miami international airport for pan ams use the agency has 
mandated installation of the machines in 40 highrisk airports 
around the world 
trans world airlines made no complaint when the first machine 
was installed at its terminal at new yorks john f kennedy airport 
in september said monte begler associate administrator of the 
federal aviation administration 
pan ams reaction was unexpected he said and id be less 
than candid if i didnt say i was disappointed 
the manufacturer said the airlines concerns were groundless 
there is no risk said hadi bozorgmanesh vice president of 
science applications international corp of san diego if there 
were we wouldnt have gotten a license from the nuclear regulatory 
commission 
but bozorgmanesh confirmed that his company and pan am reached 
an agreement wherein saic would assume all liability 
we are prepared to immediately go ahead and do the 
installation as soon as we get the goahead from faa 
bozorgmanesh said 
it will take about three weeks including installation and 
testing before the device is ready for use he said 
families of victims of the scotland crash are angered by what 
they see as pan ams footdragging said victoria cummings of coral 
gables whose husband died in the bombing 
its appalling that this kind of thing can get caught up in 
politics and profits mrs cummings said the industry has only 
its bottomline profit in mind it will probably take more 
people getting blown out of the sky to get the priorities changed 
airline officials have questioned whether the expensive 
equipment works 
during an august speech in miami pan am senior vice president 
robert gould charged that the government was forcing airlines 
which must pay for all but the first six machines to buy them for 
political reasons 
mandating new technology may please a constituency but it 
doesnt enhance safety gould said i dont believe it is as 
effective as the public may think it is and therefore were 
going to give a false impression about security

an 8yearold aids victim whose family 
battled for 2 years so she could attend school was laid to rest 
with her raggedy ann doll after a procession took her casket past 
the school and courthouse 
eliana martinez who died last week was buried monday in a 
funeral full of balloons songs praise and memories of the fight 
over her education 
her adoptive mother rosa martinez finally won the long court 
battle but the mentally disabled child went to school for only 
three weeks this year she grew too ill to continue 
eliana taught us to hug and to kiss mrs martinez said 
she takes a part of me with her her legacy is there will be 
other children going to school 
the funeral procession wound past the manhattan exceptional 
center where mrs martinez released balloons past the us 
courthouse where she won her suit and past the hillsborough county 
school board offices where educators fought elianas admission to 
class 
at the gravesite elianas small white casket was opened for her 
mother to kiss her goodbye 
strands of the colorful glass beads which eliana liked had been 
placed around her neck and her raggedy ann doll laid on her chest 
she was in a white dress with blue ribbons 
during a 90minute service at the funeral home chapel eliana 
was remembered as a frail child who never learned to speak yet 
taught adults the language of love 
playing in the background was everybodys child a song 
composed by family friend linda castellano 
teacher peggy kelly told about 125 mourners that never have i 
seen a person communicate so much with so little words this child 
had no ugliness in her at all she was always there for you 
mrs martinez adopted eliana when she was 11 months old after 
hearing a radio appeal for a sickly child abandoned in a puerto 
rico hospital 
it wasnt until four years later that mrs martinez her husband 
joe and their son joey learned eliana had acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by the time she was four months old eliana 
had received 38 transfusions and doctors believed she received 
tainted blood 
education officials in hillsborough county tried to keep eliana 
on homebound instruction fearing the risk of transmitting aids to 
other children mrs martinez sued saying eliana needed peer 
contact to develop 
a federal judge said the child could attend classes only if she 
sat inside a speciallybuilt glass booth mrs martinez appealed 
that decision and won

those magazine pages that reek of perfume 
when opened would be banned by a state legislator who says they 
threaten the health of certain sensitive types 
if you think the only hazard of leafing through a magazine or 
opening an envelope is a paper cut think again said sen martin 
connor a democrat who introduced a bill requiring that pefume 
samples be sealed in odorfree packaging 
a majority of consumers at one time or another have received a 
bill in the mail or bought a publication which was permeated by a 
cosmetic or fragrance sample this minor inconvenience for most 
people could be a major nightmare for asthmatics and allergy 
sufferers he said 
perfume companies use of fragrant samples is a major 
assault on people with chemical sensitivities said mary 
lamielle president of the voorhees njbased national center for 
environmental strategies 
lamielle said 10 percent to 20 percent of the population can be 
bothered to some degree by the chemicals in fragrance and cosmetics 
a trade group that represents the cosmetics industry said the 
bill is unnecessary 
we know of no scientific data linking such samples to any 
significant threat to the public health said michael petrina of 
the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association in testimony for 
a hearing today organized by connor

rowena cruz stood in the doorway of 
her tiny wooden shack early today and pointed to the bed where a 
brother and cousin had been fast asleep just a half hour earlier 
the bed and covers bore dark stains from the blood of the two 
men who were wounded when a 60mm mortar exploded next to the hut 
shortly after dawn 
the attack apparently came from rebels holed up in nearby 
skyskcrapers during the fifth day of their coup against president 
corazon aquino the intended target a battalion of loyalist 
marines massing a block from the huts was unscathed 
the impoverished neighborhood took the full force of the mortar 
blood trailed from the shacks to the makati medical center 
across the street where nine injured civilians were rushed for 
treatment and a 6yearold girl was declared dead on arrival 
inside a young boy lay dazed on one emergency room table blood 
smeared along his legs while a 4yearold girl screamed in pain as 
doctors disinfected a flesh wound on her back as hospital staff 
looked on 
almost all of them are stable dr phillip ong said of the

john knight wearing only electricpink swimming trunks and a 
casio watch said enough was enough the rest of this coup would be 
spent poolside at the westin philippine plaza 
four days shut up in a house is too much said knight 41 
one of hundreds of foreigners who fled their homes in rebelheld 
suburb of makati today we were running out of food and the wife 
and kids were getting psychologically tense 
knight of london brought his wife 10yearold son and 
11yearold daughter to the plaza to escape the firefight between 
rebel and loyalist troops just blocks from their home several 
embassies early today phoned their nationals in makati urging them 
to flee 
although knight left his home early enough to book a room the 
us canadian and japanese embassies reserved plaza ballrooms to 
shelter the hundreds of foreign residents who arrived after the 
hotel filled up 
the plaza overlooking manila bay and fully equipped with pool 
including slide miniature golf and mongolian barbecue provided 
a distinctly pleasant change of environment for the makati 
residents 
they were firing directly underneath me in the morning said 
harman schteiden 34 of santa clara calif as he recounted his 
decision to leave his home at 6 am now he was stretched out on a 
chaise lounge a threedayold usa today in hand 
i just figured i was out of food the electricity was out 
because of the firing and i had no exercise for two or three days 
schteiden said i took two shirts two pants underwear a 
toothbrush and my shaver and thats it

back in makati it was quickly apparent that the philippine 
constabulary fighting the rebels do not dress as a team 
some wore regulation boots others slippers 
some wore khaki others prefer tshirts 
many opted for regulation helmets but at least one dressed for 
battle in a turqouiseandpink miami vice baseball cap 
one soldier clutched his m16 in hands covered by black woolen 
gloves 
they all affixed yellow or blue ribbons to their uniforms 
however so they could distinguish themselves from the rebels 
meanwhle some civilians refused to stop working as loyalist 
soldiers took up positions along makatis streets as marines 
crisscrossed major roads dodging sniper fire just two blocks from 
rebel strongholds vendors strolled by selling cigarettes and 
balloons and blithely ignoring roadblock signs saying no entry

scottish investigators are expected to 
ask sweden to extradite a palestinian suspected of complicity in 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 a newspaper reported today 
a court in uppsala on monday said it had approved the seizure of 
evidence from mohammed abu talbs home last week because he was a 
suspect in a murder case in scotland 
a police spokesman in lockerbie scotland refused to comment on 
the courts decision and said only that our inquiries are 
continuing in sweden and elsewhere 
the bombing over the scottish town on dec 21 1988 killed all 
259 people abourt the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground 
relatives of british victims of the bombing said the development 
could be the most significant action yet in the inquiry 
dr jim swire whose daughter flora was on the plane said if 
forensic confirmation is obtained of the link it seems much the 
most significant step so far it brings nearer the point at which 
the individuals responsible can be identified 
there has been no public suggestion that abu talb a resident of 
sweden since 1983 was suspected of placing the bomb on board the 
aircraft and it was unclear whether investigators believe he had a 
direct role 
abu talb 35 a former member of the radical palestine popular 
struggle front is awaiting a verdict on separate charges of murder 
and attempted murder in connection with bombings in copenhagen 
amsterdam and stockholm in 1985 and 1986 
the dagens nyheter newspaper today said british authorities 
would submit an extradition request before that verdict due dec 
21 is announced 
the request would prevent abu talbs immediate release from 
detention in case he is acquitted on the other bombing charges the 
report said he was arrested in may 
a district court clerk in uppsala 42 miles north of stockholm 
today said no extradition request had been submitted yet 
legal experts said an extradition request could take several 
months to process requiring the approval of the supreme court and 
the government 
abu talb was charged with the death of one person and the 
attempted murder of others in copenhagen in an explosion outside 
the office of northwest orient airlines on july 22 1985 none of 
the other bombs caused casualties 
three other palestinians living in sweden also were charged in 
the bombings one was released pending the verdict after the 
sixweek trial ended last month an indication that he may be 
acquitted or receive a light sentence 
scottish and swedish investigators raided abu talbs home last 
week and seized 15 bags of clothing in an apparent search for a 
link to clothes from the suitcase that concealed the fatal bomb 
the clothing aboard the doomed flight came from a store in 
malta where abu talb reportedly was sighted two months before the 
explosion 
abu talbs passport showed he was on the mediterranean island 
oct 1926 1988 some reports said he was seen on malta with 
another palestinian hafez dalkamoni another suspect in the case 
who is in detention on other charges in west germany 
abu talb was questioned behind closed doors by the court friday 
in its decision monday the court ordered a continued blackout on 
all proceedings in the case 
jamila mograbi abu talbs commonlaw wife confirmed that abu 
talb had brought clothing from malta in october 1988 which she 
said were wholesale samples for an import business he hoped to open 
in sweden 
court records said abu talb was born in lebanon but served in 
the egyptian army and underwent military training in the soviet 
union he deserted the army in 1970 and fled to lebanon where he 
joined the palestine struggle front and headed a personal security 
unit 
according to documents abu talb came to sweden in 1986 on a 
false moroccan passport and had used several different identities 
and birth dates with various swedish authorities miss mograbi said 
the couple has been living in sweden for six years

the soviet union has agreed to supply 
fuel to the antarctic expedition led by minnesotan will steger 
preventing an early end to the 4000mile ski and sled dog 
adventure 
until the soviets stepped forward monday the international 
transantarctica expedition faced the possibility of abandoning its 
historic journey at the south pole where it is expected to arrive 
next week 
it was really serious said cynthia mueller a spokeswoman 
at the expeditions st paul headquarters 
the expedition has been jeopardized by breakdowns in the air 
support provided by adventure network international inc a 
canadian firm that has a monopoly on nongovernment flight 
transportation in antarctica 
transantarcticas 15 million logistical contract calls for 
adventure network to place food caches and provide emergency rescue 
from the beginning of the expedition on the antarctic peninsula to 
the soviet scientific base at vostok where the soviets take over 
that responsibility 
however finicky weather and repeated mechanical failures by 
adventure networks cargo carrier an aging dc6 left the 
expedition without supplies east of the thiel mountains which it 
passed more than a week ago 
now within 220 miles and one week of the south pole the 
expedition feared running out of food for steger his five 
companions and 30 sled dogs 
without a sufficient supply of fuel at the pole for resupply 
and rescue operations the expedition would have been forced to 
halt operations next week said spokeswoman jennifer kimball 
gasperini 
the soviets who are limited partners in the expedition said 
monday that as much as 12 tons of sovietowned airplane fuel will 
be waiting for the expedition at the south pole meaning the dog 
mushers will be able to receive food and have a rescue plane 
standing by as they continue east across the area of 
inaccessibility a remote stretch of ice between the south pole and 
vostok 
the soviets will sell the expedition fuel already cached at the 
south pole rather than risk a flight across the continent 
although details are still being negotiated the soviet aid will 
cost transantarctica as much as 200000 
the expedition which began july 27 is making its sevenmonth 
journey to bring world attention to antarctica and to demonstrate 
the power of international cooperation the expeditions other 
members are from the soviet union france great britain japan and 
china

the st louis sun which debuted sept 25 has averaged 107000 
readers a day in its first two months while the st louis 
postdispatchs circulation has remained steady at 378000 daily 
and 565000 on sunday 
we look on it as a competition which is something different 
than a war said ralph ingersoll ii the suns editorinchief 
and the chairman and chief executive officer of its parent company 
ingersoll publications co 
ingersoll and nicholas penniman iv publisher of the 
111yearold postdispatch and vice president of the pulitzer 
publishing co spoke monday at the annual meeting of the missouri 
and kansas associated press publishers and editors 
i do firmly believe that the postdispatch is a much better 
newspaper today than it was a year ago penniman said 
the postdispatchs saturday newspaper has increased its 
circulation about 3 percent to 348000 since the sun began 
appearing with its expanded saturday paper that costs 1 compared 
to 25 cents for the postdispatch 
ingersoll said he still expected the sun to turn a profit by the 
end of 1990 but that profits wont be as high as originally 
projected because of the large number of home subscribers taking 
the sun home subscribers pay less 
he said he expects the suns circulation by the end of 1990 to 
be about 125000 
david lipman managing editor of the postdispatch said the new 
competition has accelerated changes at the newspaper and given it a 
jolt of adrenalin 
the postdispatch feels 10 years younger and were going to 
continue feeling young and being useful and still be a lot of 
fun he said 
before the debut of the sun the postdispatch had been without 
competition since the st louis globedemocrat folded in october 
1986

and war bonnet that signified fools crows death led the wooden 
wagon to the graveyard about 60 horses and riders and a string of 
cars two miles long were in tow 
when a warrior dies they take their horse so the journey into 
the spirit world is a good one said severt young bear of 
porcupine 
family members rode in a limousine owned by dennis banks a 
cofounder of the oncemilitant american indian movement banks and 
aim cofounder russell means traveled to kyle to pay last respects 
to fools crow 
a lot of young people have come back to the traditional ways 
because of him banks said 
banks said few people know it was fools crow who decided that 
wounded knee should be the site of a 1973 armed confrontation 
between about 300 aim supporters and 300 federal lawmen 
he knew something was going to happen so he said we should go 
back to wounded knee banks said 
two indians were killed in the 71day takeover and two law 
officers were wounded

the 1973 wounded knee uprising used fools crow as an example of how 
indians should live

the soviet union has indicated it is ready to pull 
out some of the estimated 80000 troops it has kept in 
czechoslovakia since soviet tanks spearheaded a 1968 invasion that 
crushed prague spring reforms 
the announcement by tass came on the same day the soviet union 
and four other warsaw pact allies that took part in the invasion 
jointly denounced it 
the official soviet news agency said foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze met monday with foreign minister jaromir johanes of 
czechoslovakia to discuss deployment of soviet troops in the east 
bloc country 
it was decided to begin appropriate sovietczechoslovak 
consultations with the understanding that this issue should be 
tackled in accordance with the ongoing european disarmament 
process tass said 
reduction of armed forces and armaments on condition of 
maintaining european balance is the indispensable guarantee of 
stability in europe 
according to figures from the rival north american treaty 
organization the warsaw pact has 3 million fulltime military 
personnel in europe compared with 22 million for the western 
alliance pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity 36 
million for nato and 35 million for the east bloc 
bulgaria east germany hungary poland and the soviet union 
issued their firstever joint statement condemning the invasion 
which they had defended for nearly two decades at the end of a 
oneday warsaw pact meeting monday 
the dispatch of the armies of the five socialist countries to 
czechoslovakia in 1968 was an act of interference in domestic 
affairs of sovereign czechoslovakia and should be condemned tass 
reported 
for months following momentous political change in eastern 
europe all the signers of mondays announcement except the soviets 
condemned the invasion of their ally 
romania was not a party to mondays statement its hardline 
leader nicolae ceausescu attended the meeting but his country 
refused to take part in the invasion 
ironically ceausescu is reported to have urged a warsaw pact 
invasion of poland in august when it became the first east bloc 
country to seat a government not led by communists 
in a separate statement monday the soviet government admitted 
the decision to send troops into czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a 
communistled reform movement was erroneous in light of all facts 
known now 
the soviet announcement likened the situation in 1968 to the 
current political upheaval in czechoslovakia where demonstrations 
and a general strike have forced changes in the leadership the 
statement said this was a natural process of selfreassessment 
the warsaw pact meeting came one day after president mikhail s 
gorbachev and president bush completed their summit in malta

toyota motor corp has recalled every lexus ls400 
luxury automobile sold in the united states so far because of a 
sticky cruise control mechanism and defective stoplight cover 
the recall announced monday is the first for lexus which went 
on sale in early september november sales figures were due out 
later today but company officials estimated that about 8000 cars 
would be affected by the recall 
the lexus division of toyota also makes and markets the es250 
automobile which is not subject to the recall 
we havent had any accidents or injuries lexus vice 
president dave illingworth said he said the two problems had 
brought one customer complaint each 
in addition to the cruise control and stoplamp problems lexus 
mechanics also will be sure that a wiring connector between the 
alternator and the battery is seated properly if not clicked into 
place battery power could be drained lexus spokesman kurt von 
zumwalt said 
its hard in the short term but in the long term it will help 
our image von zumwalt said in a telephone interview from his 
office in california 
the company said it would replace a cruise control actuator 
which controls the throttle 
he also said the plastic covering on the centermounted 
stoplight would be replaced because letting the light burn too long 
could melt the covering 
letters were to be sent today to owners of the ls400 which 
sells for 35000 telling them to take their cars to the nearest 
lexus dealership 
we believe that we will have everything handled within two to 
three weeks illingworth said

an attempted military coup in the philippines has 
given some anxious moments to plaintiffs who are depending on a key 
witness to leave that country and testify in federal court 
the wrongfuldeath lawsuit accuses former philippines president 
ferdinand marcos his widow imelda and others of arranging the 
june 1981 murders of two seattle union activists because of their 
antimarcos activities 
one key witness is bonifacio gillego a onetime member of 
marcos intelligence network who later rebelled against marcos and 
now is a house member under the government of president corazon 
aquino 
gillego is expected to draw a lot of the threads together 
from previous testimony about marcos intelligence agents operating 
in the united states said sharon maeda spokeswoman for the 
committee for justice for domingo and viernes 
silme domingo and gene viernes were activist reformers in the 
alaska cannery workers union they were shot in union offices in 
seattle on june 1 1981 
as a legislator gillego was required to obtain special 
permission to leave the philippines during the coup emergency said 
domingos sister cindy domingo at last report he had obtained 
that permission but still faced the task of trying to get a flight 
out of the country to appear here probably next week 
at least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded 
since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed 
the presidential palace in manila on friday according to the red 
cross 
the chances of gillego being able to attend look very good 
ms domingo said monday less certain was the status of randolph 
david a philippines university professor who was scheduled to 
testify about marcos martiallaw regime 
if david is unable to leave the philippines he would likely 
give a deposition by telephone ms domingo said 
three men have been convicted of murdering the two men 
allegedly in an internal union dispute but plaintiffs claim 
marcos government marked the men for death because of their 
antimarcos activities including support for antimarcos trade 
unionists in the philippines 
the suit filed in september 1982 seeks 30 million on behalf 
of the mens families in addition to the marcoses defendants 
include the men convicted of the murders the philippines 
government dr leonilo malabed of san francisco a marcos friend 
who ran the mabuhay corp and constantine baruso a former union 
president whose gun was used in the killings baruso was never 
charged in the killings 
it was gillego in particular who drew the plaintiffs 
attention to the most important document in the case a supposed 
account sheet for the mabuhay corp a san francisco company that 
plaintiffs claim was used to funnel money from the philippines to 
agents in this country 
that account sheet includes a 15000 entry that plaintiffs 
claim was money used to pay for the murders

baldness may be reversed with a new drug that 
blocks the male hormone testosterone on scalp cells without the 
side effects of steroidbased drugs a dermatologist reported 
the drug cyoctol helped hair growth in 10 of 12 men in a study 
said dr richard a strick of the university of california los 
angeles during a presentation monday to the american academy of 
dermatology in san francisco 
cyoctol a synthetic compound developed by los angelesbased 
chantal pharmaceutical corp will be tested by bristolmyers 
squibb co to treat acne and baldness 
stricks results sound as though they are at least comparable to 
the hairgrowth gains men make with minoxidil the only drug 
approved for use in the united states against male pattern baldness 
and marketed as rogaine said dr dowling b stough a 
dermatologist at the university of arkansas 
balding men who used a solution of cyoctol had 12 percent more 
hair on a test patch of scalp than they had a year earlier the 
strick study showed men who hadnt been treated lost 9 percent of 
their hair 
previous studies found that minoxidil resulted in moderate to 
dense hair growth in 39 percent of men who used it for a year 
rogaine a 2 percent minoxidil solution is the only 
fdaapproved hair loss treatment and is a nonsteroid based drug 
it has been on the market for over a year and costs about 60 for a 
onemonth supply 
strick suggested that perhaps using a combination of cyoctol and 
minoxidil could produce dramatic results 
but strick was cautious about directly comparing cyoctols 
results to those with rogaine the studies are not directly 
comparable he said because they analyzed different sections of 
the balding spot and also because they counted hairs in test 
sections differently 
in rogaine studies the hairs were counted by hand and the 
cyoctol test used a new computerized method 
the us food and drug administration also recently approved a 
cyoctol analog as an investigational new drug against skin 
wrinkling 
stough said the cyoctol study was small and that baldness 
remedies frequently dont live up to their early promise 
he also said that if cyoctol proves effective against baldness 
it would work best in men in the early stages of hair loss when 
most follicles have not died 
you cant grow daffodils without bulbs and you cant grow hair 
without follicles stough said 
additionally cyoctol appears to have no side effects like 
steroidbased preparations cyoctol is considered exciting because 
it doesnt act as a steroid interfering with the bodys hormonal 
balance 
steroidal substances can reverse baldness but they can lead to 
undesired feminine body characteristics such as cessation of beard 
growth and enhanced breast development 
cyoctol blocks the sites on the walls of the scalp cells at 
which the male hormone testosterone attaches to cause male pattern 
baldness when attachment occurs the hair follicle shrinks and 
eventually stops growing hair this type of baldness runs in 
families and affects about 30 percent of men in the united states

devi lal who were sworn in saturday 
no portfolios were announced during the televised halfhour 
ceremony presided over by president ramaswamy venkataraman at the 
presidential palace 
singh told reporters portfolios would be announced wednesday he 
said more ministers would be announced later 
he denied the delays were caused by dissension within his 
national front centrist coalition which was created this year by 
people who had little in common except their opposition to gandhi 
and his congress party 
the coalition combined to create the most cohesive opposition 
force since india became independent 42 years ago and it resulted 
in the congress party being bumped from power for only the second 
time since then 
singh leader of the national front must seek parliaments vote 
of confidence for his government by the end of december 
the new ministers include gandhis estranged cousin and his 
former minister of state for home affairs arun nehru extourism 
minister mufti mohammed sayeed and exminister of state for 
industry arif mohammed khan

minister is the leader of the janata dal or peoples party the 
largest of the five parties comprising the national front

janata dal one minister represents each of the coalitions other 
four parties the congress socialist party and three regional 
parties the telegu desam from andhra pradesh state asom gana

support from two extremes of the political spectrum the 
rightwing hindu fundamentalist bharatiya janata party and a 
communist alliance 
the national front won 144 parliamentary seats the bharatiya 
janata or indian peoples party which captured 88 seats and the 
communist alliance which won 51 said they will support singh but 
will not join the government

a faculty vote to ban the reserve officers 
training corps from the university of wisconsinmadison because of 
discrimination against homosexuals is not binding but will 
encourage debate officials said 
the faculty voted 386248 monday in favor of the resolution 
which calls for the removal of the army navy and air force rotc in 
may 1993 if the military continues to refuse candidates on the 
basis of homosexuality 
the action is not binding because only the board of regents 
which governs university of wisconsin campuses across the state 
can terminate the rotc contract with the federal government 
it was unlikely the uw regents would consider the resolution at 
its meeting on friday said regent erroll davis who declined to 
say whether he would support such a ban 
it isnt on our agenda davis said i certainly wouldnt 
begin to speculate on what my fellow board members would do 
chancellor donna shalala said the faculty vote could bring the 
issue to the attention of congress 
its the beginning i hope of a major debate about 
discrimination in the rotc she said 
opponents of the resolution said it would hurt the university 
and wouldnt create a change in the militarys policy 
this will make the campus less appealing to prospective rotc 
students and the us department of defense said gordon baldwin a 
law professor and the rotcs faculty liaison 
this is like a mosquito bite on a whale baldwin said i 
would be surprised if the regents canceled these contracts 
baldwin who was among about 15 faculty members who spoke at the 
meeting said afterward he doesnt support or oppose the militarys 
stand on homosexuals 
last week republican gov tommy g thompson said rotc should be 
allowed to remain on campus because it is good for the university 
system 
the total of 634 votes cast monday compared with 2400 faculty 
members who were eligible to vote 
the rotc at madison serves 440 students 155 whom are on full 
scholarship baldwin said 
supporters of rotc said the university which was founded under 
the federal land grant act of 1862 is required to provide military 
instruction 
the faculty resolution would give the program until 1993 to 
change its policy and accept homosexuals if it refused the 
resolution urges moving the program off campus until the ban is 
lifted

the search for a missing commuter 
plane with eight people aboard resumed today with a coast guard 
ship carrying sophisticated sonar to look for wreckage in about 100 
feet of water 
the search of block island sound for a twinengine new england 
airlines plane missing since nov 28 was postponed monday by heavy 
waves and high wind said coast guard lt hank leeper 
seas of 4 to 8 feet were whipped by wind blowing at 20 to 35 
knots 
thats prohibitive for us for operating the sidescanning 
sonar which does not work well in waves of more than 6 feet said 
richard walker an engineer with the coast guard research and 
development center in groton conn 
seas today averaged 2 to 3 feet with wind under 12 mph said 
seaman michael allard at the point judith coast guard station 
the plane took off from block island on a night flight to 
westerly 17 miles across the sound floating debris and the bodies 
of two dogs belonging to a passenger indicated the brittennorman 
islander broke up a national transportation safety board spokesman 
said 
leeper said searchers would concentrate on a threesquaremile 
primary area where a study of wind and tide action made the 
greatest probability of finding the wreckage they hoped to cover 
that in a day with the sonar 
the sonar will show anything rock outcroppings it looks 
very much like an aerial photograph as if the water were 
removed said john fish president of american underwater search 
and survey inc of cataumet mass which provided the equipment

former communist party chief erich honecker 
and other members of his ousted leadership have been put under 
house arrest at their luxury residential compound the official 
news agency adn said today 
also east germanys chief prosecutor resigned after mounting 
criticism he could not handle investigations into abuses of power 
by ousted communist leaders citizens began to keep vigil at police 
stations 
honecker lost his job in a major power reshuffle on oct 18 and 
on sunday he was ousted from the party he had led for 18 years he 
was replaced as party leader by egon krenz who resigned under 
pressure sunday along with his politburo and central committee 
the former generalsecretary and president erich honecker is 
among those who are not allowed to leave their houses in the 
elegant compound adn reported the wandlitz compound near berlin 
has 23 houses used by politburo members and their families 
adn said all former politburo members who were still living at 
wandlitz also were held there 
it was not immediately clear when honecker was arrested the 
77yearold former leader has been in ill health following surgery 
last summer and had been a virtual recluse in wandlitz since 
october 
honecker and his inner circle are under investigation for 
suspected corruption three former politburo members are already in 
prison pending investigation 
prosecutors sealed off secret police offices in east berlin 
where large sums of money and files had apparently been packaged 
for transport adn said they acted on a tip from citizens keeping 
watch outside 
growing public outrage has led to citizens to try to storm at 
least one public building while others have stood guard to make 
sure that no potential criminal evidence is smuggled away from 
government offices 
adn gave no reason for prosecutor guenter wendlands resignation 
wendland was a holdover from honeckers hardline government and 
had been leading a probe of police accused of beating and 
mistreating prodemocracy protesters following massive rallies in 
early october 
a group of lawyers and legal experts had demanded his 
resignation saying he was too close to the nowdisgraced former 
power structure to handle the probes 
the 25member interim committee guiding east germanys communist 
party has appealed to angry citizens for calm to avoid anarchy 
and chaos 
in bonn the federal government announced that rudolf seiters 
the top aide to chancellor helmut kohl would travel to east berlin 
late today for talks with premier hans modrow 
the 61yearold premier has emerged as the nations top 
political figure since the communist partys leadership quit on 
sunday 
seiters was scheduled to see whether kohl should go forward with 
his planned visit to east germany that had been expected by the end 
of the year 
west germany has called for reunification of the countries a 
proposal rejected by the communists and some opposition activists 
but late monday about 200000 people rallied in leipzig calling 
for reunification and shouting germany united fatherland 
the move against the secret police was the latest in a series of 
searches and seizures 
adn said investigators discovered bundles of secret police files 
in a sensitive area packed for transport citizens in east 
berlin had become suspicious when they spotted lights on in several 
secret police offices where the shades had been pulled they 
notified police 
the prosecutor sealed several offices and ordered police to 
guard them 
during the search one person carrying two large suitcases left 
the building through a side door but was stopped by a group of 
citizens who turned him over to police adn said 
prosecutor rainer glawe permitted olaf klein a member of the 
opposition group new forum to observe the investigation 
glawe later said the person who had been apprehended was freed 
after identification but that the two suitcases contained large 
sums of east german marks and foreign currencies 
apparently according to what is known the money was intended 
for a contact person of swedish nationality for further delivery to 
fake companies to which the name schalckgolodkowski has been 
connected adn said 
alexander schalckgolodkowski was east germanys chief trade 
negotiator he is being sought as a fugitive in connection with 
shady currency and weapons deals and disappeared this weekend 
east germanys ambassador in switzerland eckard bibow said 
today the country has issued an international warrant for 
schalckgolodkowskis arrest 
in the first direct cooperation the temporary committee running 
the communist party joined with opposition groups to form a 
commission to investigate charges of corruption 
the central committee building in east berlin was ringed by 
security officials who checked cars and bags of officials leaving 
the party headquarters 
offices and safes of former officials were placed under guard to 
prevent them from destroying or spiriting away documents

after a month of deliberations the jury in 
the mcmartin preschool molestation trial is discussing a new 
subject whether or not to interrupt deliberations for a christmas 
vacation 
the jurors were confronted with the option monday after superior 
court judge william pounders yielded to their concerns and decided 
not to announce partial verdicts before the scheduled christmas 
break on dec 15 
he urged jurors to reconsider whether they want to take the two 
weeks off or continue deliberating 
our concern is with you he said we have to keep you 
together healthy and hopefully happy and not so angry at each 
other that we lose one of you 
the jurors retired to their deliberation room but had not 
announced their decision by days end 
three jurors had told the judge earlier they were worried about 
community pressure on them if partial verdicts were publicized 
before the entire 65 counts were resolved 
the jurors are considering 65 separate charges against raymond 
buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 who are 
accused of molesting children at their family owned preschool in 
manhattan beach 
the 2yearold trial is the longest and costliest criminal 
proceeding in los angeles and us history and the judge has said 
hes determined to get verdicts six original alternates were used 
up as illness and job problems caused them to drop out all 
verdicts must be unanimous and loss of one juror now could cause a 
mistrial 
in an unusual plan pounders asked the jury to deliver sealed 
verdicts as they decided individual counts but since no verdict is 
final until it is announced in court and affirmed by all jurors he 
had planned to announce a partial verdict before the vacation 
he intended the vacation to give jurors respite from stress of 
deliberations which could take months but on monday it turned out 
that at least seven jurors planned to return to their jobs during 
the break rather than take vacations 
pounders then suggested they might want to cancel the vacation 
however at least one juror has purchased plane tickets for an out 
of state trip and would lose money if it was canceled he said

israeli troops shot and killed five guerrillas 
today who infiltrated israel from egypt the military announced 
it said the clash occurred in the morning after the guerrillas 
crossed the border from egypts sinai peninsula into the western 
part of israels southern negev desert 
it was the first infiltration in nine months from egypt the 
only arab country to have signed a peace treaty with israel 
an israeli force encountered the guerrillas gave chase and 
killed them all without suffering any casualties the army said 
it was not known to which organization the guerrillas belonged 
they carried five sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault rifles 
grenades a pistol with magazines binoculars and wire cutters the 
army said 
the head of the armys southern command maj gen matan vilnai 
told israel army radio the attack apparently was linked to the 
second anniversary this week of the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied lands 
we can assume there is a link between these things there 
is no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carry 
out such an attack vilnai said he refused to give details of 
the clash 
he said the guerrillas carried at least 50 grenades 
this equipment shows they simply meant to kill not to argue 
too much not to carry out a hostagetaking operation but a 
killing operation vilnai said 
vilnai noted that israels border with egypt was usually quiet 
israel and egypt signed a usmediated peace treaty in 1979 and 
have full diplomatic relations 
the last reported infiltration from egypt occurred march 15 
when two teenaged palestinian guerrillas were captured near the 
border town of rafah 
army sources said the guerrillas planned to attack an army base 
or patrol in the area 
a year earlier on march 7 1988 three palestinian guerrillas 
who infiltrated from egypt seized a commuter bus near the southern 
city of beersheva three civilians were killed and nine reported 
wounded the guerrillas were shot to death when antiriot police 
stormed the vehicle

republican and democratic parties in nine 
battleground states last year received 285 million in soft 
money contributions unregulated by federal campaign laws a study 
released today said 
the study by the center for responsive politics did not examine 
how the money was spent 
however ellen miller executive director of the center said 
the report finds such obvious patterns of questionable soft money 
giving that anyone can see there was wholesale erosion of our 
campaign finance laws during last years presidential campaign 
soft money consists primarily of direct contributions by 
corporations and labor unions which cannot be given in any amount 
to federal elections and individual donations that exceed amounts 
permitted by federal law 
in 41 states it is legal to use union and corporate 
contributions for state and local election campaigns more than 
half the states also allow unlimited individual contributions to 
the political parties 
it is illegal to use such money in presidential or congressional 
election campaigns which are governed by federal law 
based on the record publicily available any individual soft 
money donations identified in this report may in themselves have 
been fully legal but overall these donations and the aggregate 
amounts of soft money contributions identified illustrate the 
potential for abuse in the current law the centers study said 
the center is a private nonprofit organization that studies 
congressional campaign finance and other issues its board of 
directors is chaired by bethine church widow of former sen frank 
church didaho and includes former republican and democratic 
members of congress 
the states studied were california colorado florida illinois 
missouri north carolina pennsylvania texas and washington they 
were selected because their laws permit soft money contributions 
they had extensive disclosure requirements and they were hotly 
contested or battleground states in the presidential campaign 
ms miller said 
the republican and democratic parties in the states received 11 
million from individuals and 65 million from corporations the 
study said the democratic national committee contributed slightly 
more than 75 million in soft money and the republican national 
committee just over 2 million in the nine states 
about onethird of the contributions wre made in the month 
before the election the republican national committee for 
instance gave 80 percent of its money in the nine states during 
that period 
the california gop received the most soft money of any state 
party examined getting 58 million 
more than 77 percent of the corporate contributions of 20000 
or more went to republican state parties as did nearly 90 percent 
of the individual contributions of that size 
the states in which soft money totals were the largest were 
california 102 million florida 47 million illinois 44 
million texas 32 million colorado 21 million and missouri 
15 million the remaining totals were nearly 1 million in 
washington 883000 in pennsylvania and 345286 in north carolina 
the leading individual donor in the nine states was h wayne 
huizenga president of blockbuster entertainment of fort 
lauderdale fla who gave 117000 the leader among business 
contributors was atlantic richfield corp which gave 159500

the supreme court today made it easier for 
workers to sue their unions over alleged failures to provide fair 
representation 
the court unanimously reinstated a federal lawsuit a toledo 
ohio area sheet metal worker filed against his union five years 
ago 
lynn l breiningers suit contends that local 6 of the sheet 
metal workers international association discriminated against him 
in referring work out of its hiring hall 
lower courts had thrown out the suit ruling that breininger was 
alleging an unfair labor practice and that the national labor 
relations board has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims 
those courts were wrong the justices said today 
that a breach of duty of fair representation might also be an 
unfair labor practice is not enough to deprive a federal court of 
jurisdiction over the fair representation claim justice william 
j brennan wrote 
he added federal courts have jurisdiction to hear 
fairrepresentation suits whether or not they are accompanied by 
claims against employers 
local 6 represents sheet metal workers who work for various 
employers in the toledo area the union has collective bargaining 
agreements with two associations of employers 
the union operates a jobreferral system out of a union hiring 
hall 
breininger a longtime union member alleges that the union 
refused to honor employers specific requests for his services and 
unjustifiably passed him over in making referrals 
his suit also contended that local 6 had violated the federal 
labormanagement reporting and disclosure act of 1959 by in 
effect disciplining him because he had politically opposed some 
union leaders 
todays decision was not a total defeat for local 6 the 
justices by a 72 vote said lower courts were right in ruling 
that the unions alleged failure to refer breininger for jobs 
through its hiring hall is not even if true a violation of the 
1959 law 
that still left breininger free to pursue his 
fairrepresentation claim in federal court 
justices john paul stevens and antonin scalia dissented from 
that part of the courts decision they said breininger should be 
allowed to sue over the alleged violation of the 1959 law in 
addition to the alleged failure of fair representation 
the case is breininger vs sheet metal workers 88124

one of the nations two republics 
today named a government dominated by noncommunists following 
rallies nationwide that denounced the communists and demanded a new 
federal government 
the czech republics new government was the first of any kind in 
czechoslovakia in 41 years that the communists did not dominate 
hours after the regional government was named an opposition 
delegation led by playwright vaclav havel met with communist 
premier ladislav adamec to discuss how to meet popular demands for 
democracy by reshuffling the federal government 
the czech republics parliament accepted the resignations of 11 
ministers in the regional government and sacked communist deputy 
premier jaroslav tlapak the staterun news agency ctk reported 
however communist frantisek pitra remained as premier of the 
regional government the new 16member cabinet named to serve under 
him contains nine noncommunists five nonparty people and four 
from parties traditionally allied with the communists but now 
playing a more independent role seven were communists 
the czech republics actions could pave the way for similar 
changes in the federal government as demanded by angry protesters 
opposed to the federal government named sunday that cabinet 
contained only five noncommunists and left the communists in all 
the key ministries 
striking students actors and other artists today promised to 
continue their 2weekold sitins and work stoppages for another 
week 
as adamec met with opposition leaders at the federal government 
building in prague about 2000 students gathered outside and 
blocked access to it by building a giant wall of cardboard boxes 
and chanting resign resign 
more than 150000 people jammed pragues wenceslas square on 
monday night and chanted the same slogan and demanded free 
elections by july 
they must go the protesters roared in condemnation of the 
national communist leadership they lied to us again 
at least 50000 people rallied in the slovak capital of 
bratislava monday night and the state news agency ctk reported 
protests in the bohemian city of usti nad labem to the north 
gottwaldov to the east and ostrova on the polish border 
the protests replaced the euphoria of a week ago when the 
popular movement to end 41 years of orthodox communist rule brought 
down the old hardline leadership many demonstrators feel the 
communists are reneging on promises of reform 
opposition leaders threatened to call a general strike on monday 
if adamec does not form a new national government by sunday that 
includes more noncommunists 
last week the communist party officially relinquished its 
monopoly on power and adamec raised peoples hopes by promising a 
coalition government 
the concessions followed a twohour general strike nov 27 that 
was organized by civic forum as a referendum on oneparty communist 
rule the strike paralyzed the country as millions of people poured 
into the streets 
but the communists hold all the key ministries on the new 
21member cabinet thirteen members are holdovers from the 
administration that resigned last month under public pressure 
the civic forum moving away from its previously stated role as 
strictly an opposition coalition said it would propose its own 
candidates for a new government 
civic forum spokesman jiri dienstbier said the opposition faces 
increasing public demands to establish a clearcut political 
program 
he said civic forum could endorse candidates who are members of 
other parties if they endorse the opposition coalitions ideals 
foremost among them free elections speech and assembly 
in another indication of the strength of opposition pressure a 
parliamentary commission appointed to investigate the harsh police 
repression of a student demonstration on nov 17 delivered its 
report 
ctk said the committee reported that 1569 riot police used 
brutal and undue force against the demonstrators public outrage at 
the police tactics helped launch what became 11 straight days of 
massive prodemocracy demonstrations 
the commission report said an undetermined number of 
demonstrators suffered serious injuries including internal 
bleeding and spinal damage the report dismissed as unrealistic the 
interior ministry statement that 44 demonstrators were injured 
it also disputed official statements that demonstrators attacked 
police and said some police actions by police were so brutal there 
could be prosecutions for assault and abuse of public office 
the report concluded by saying high political persons were 
responsible for the police actions and the suppression of previous 
protests but did not give any names

the navy learned a lesson when 
greenpeace antinuclear protesters halted the submarine launch of a 
trident 2 missile in july and it was ready for them this time 
in a high seas drama 50 miles off the florida coast on monday 
navy ships rammed and firehosed the 190foot mv greenpeace vessel 
while helicopters buzzed two small highspeed rafts sailors in 
motorized rafts cut the fuel lines of one greenpeace raft before 
towing both out of the launch safety zone 
with their vessels helpless about 25 greenpeace activists could 
only watch as the nuclear submarine tennessee unleashed the trident 
2 the navys newest most powerful weapon on a successful test 
launch 
the 44foot missile shot out of a tube in the subs deck broke 
the seas surface ignited and hurled a dummy warhead package to an 
ocean target several thousand miles away 
we did a perfect launch just beautiful vice adm roger 
bacon commander of the atlantic submarines fleet told reporters 
the success of the fourth trident 2 test flight put the program 
back on track toward becoming operational next spring after two 
explosive failures in the first three tests 
greenpeace spokesman steven shallhorn said today on abcs good 
morning america that the group believes the navy acted in panic 
they are very very desperate to save their trident 2 missile 
program he said because of the technical failures that they 
have its a prime candidate to be cut when defense spending starts 
to be cut next year 
bacon also appeared on the abc program and said he was concerned 
about safety 
i warned that vessel over 50 times most of the times 
personally to remain outside of 5000 yards from the submarine 
he said they did everything just not safe and i want these 
operations to be safe 
greenpeace which said it was considering suing the navy for 
mondays action had successfully used the mv greenpeace and the 
two motorized rafts called zodiacs to halt a launch from the 
tennessee in july 
we were more prepared today because we looked at what they 
tried to do on july 28 and we used the minimum force necessary 
today to clear the area bacon said 
the minimum force included three large ships three 
helicopters and eight motorized rafts more than 900 sailors were 
assigned to the task force that kept the launch area clear 
this is a terrible outrage said peter bahouth executive 
director of greenpeace usa in a statement this is an unbridled 
act of aggression against a peaceful protest in international 
waters 
for many years greenpeace has attempted to stop nuclear testing 
at sea in july 1985 this tactic of direct intervention turned 
tragic when french secret agents sunk the rainbow warrior a 
greenpeace ship off auckland new zealand 
the ship was sent to protest french nuclear testing in the south 
pacific explosives were attached to the ships hull one crew 
member was killed 
greenpeaces protest monday was over the united states refusal 
to negotiate with the soviet union on a reduction of seabased 
nuclear missiles 
the incident began at dawn as the tennessee submerged for the 
trident 2 countdown and the mv greenpeace moved inside the 
5000yard diameter safety circle around the sub 
burnette said the navy repeated warnings if the protesters 
didnt clear the area the navy would exercise its rights under 
international law and will forcibly remove you 
the mv greenpeace radioed back you are doing your best but 
you havent sunk us yet we are staying 
two submarine support ships the grasp and the kittiwake took 
up positions on either side of the greenpeace shot water from fire 
hoses into the smoke stacks to stop the engines and then bumped the 
vessel out of the safety area 
greenpeace spokeswoman shannon fagan reported two holes one a 
threefoot gash were punched in the greenpeace hull the navy said 
it counted only one hole about one foot in diameter 
fagan said the greenpeace was dead in the water for about 
an hour until the crew got one of the engines restarted the ship 
then limped toward port in jacksonville fla 
the navy plans five more submarine launches of the trident 2 if 
all goes well the tennessee is scheduled to go on operational 
patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles each is capable 
of propelling as many as 12 warheads to different targets more than 
4600 miles away

officials at the lawrence livermore 
national laboratory denied a congressional report that said there 
were serious security lapses involving large amounts of plutonium 
at no time has plutonium been unprotected said l lynn 
cleland acting manager of the weapons labs safeguards and 
security cleland at a news conference monday called lawrence 
livermores plutonium building one of our most highly secured 
facilities 
according to a report released sunday the federal weapons lab 
35 miles east of san francisco had left the radioactive material 
enough for a nuclear weapon unattended 
the report included transcripts of testimony by department of 
energy officials at a hearing last july before the house energy and 
commerce subcommitee on oversight and investigations the panel is 
investigating the department of energys weapons facilities 
according to the transcript of the testimony edward j 
mccallum the does top security evaluator testified that 
livermore lab security has not been effective 
amounts of plutonium and other nuclear weapons materials were 
left unattended in unalarmed rooms during offshift hours 
mccallum said previous security measures were inadequate to 
protect the material from sabotage or theft but the lab has since 
corrected the problem he said 
cleland while insisting no plutonium was unprotected and that 
none of it was missing said the lab agreed with a doe 
recommendation to improve security 
there were deficiencies but we did not feel they were very 
serious but they were serious enough that they needed to be 
addressed and we addressed them he said 
livermore ranked lowest of all 26 nuclear weapons facilities in 
the nation for safeguarding nuclear weapons materials according to 
the testimony lab officials said they didnt know how the doe 
arrived at that ranking

the department of health and human services 
collected nearly 57 billion in settlements fines restitutions 
and savings in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 according to an 
hhs inspector generals report released today 
but it contended that millions more could be saved if the 
department heeded inspector general richard kusserows 
recommendations involving changes in the medicare and medicaid 
programs 
recommendations by the inspector general or internal watchdog 
for savings prosecutions and sanctions have netted 269 billion 
for the department over the past five years the report said 
changes that result from rules changes in hhs programs like 
medicaid and medicare account for the largest savings 
the report estimated that the health care financing 
administration which runs medicare and medicaid will save 465 
million over five years with establishment of a reasonable payment 
rate for a new drug for patients with kidney disease 
it also projected a fiveyear savings of 312 million with 
elimination of medicare payments for unnecessary assistant surgeon 
services 
the report also outlined previous inspector general 
recommendations for savings that the department has not acted on 
for example it said the financing administration could save 
400 million to 900 million annually by requiring insurance 
companies that are primary payers to pay claims instead of passing 
them on to medicare 
the inspector general also said medicare could save millions of 
dollars each year by tightening controls to assure that special 
seatlift chairs to help a patient stand up are medically necessary 
kusserows office said it logged 1278 successful prosecutions 
last year and collected 81 million in fines and recoveries it 
also imposed 846 administrative sanctions during the period 
in one of the largest settlements ever won by the department a 
medical device manufacturer in florida paid 56 million civil 
settlement with hhs and the justice and veteran affairs 
departments the agreement resolved allegations that the company 
manufacturered and distributed defective pacemakers 
in another case more than 2 million was recovered from a 
number of illinois hospitals that had billed the medicare program 
twice for the same services

the hardline leader of the serbian 
republic today refused to reestablish political or business ties 
with the republic of slovenia until its liberal leaders step down 
the speech was viewed as the harshest attack by a yugoslav 
politician on another constituent republic in 46 years of communist 
rule in this country 
in an unprecedented move serbia on wednesday cut all ties with 
slovenia after authorities there banned an antislovenian rally 
planned by serbs on dec 1 
serbian president slobodan milosevic speaking in the serbian 
parliament today accused the slovenian leadership of being 
brutal for not allowing the protest 
slovenias liberaloriented leadership advocates regional 
autonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties that 
are to take part in the first contested elections in postwar 
yugoslavia in march 
the serbian leadership favors a centralized federation and 
opposes westernstyle political pluralism 
last year massive demonstrations orchestrated by serbia toppled 
leaderships in the republic of montenegro and in the provinces of 
vojvodina and kosovo the leaders were replaced by milosevic 
supporters 
milosevic said his republic will not have ties with slovenia 
until the conservative aggressive and brutal forces make room 
for what is democratic peaceloving and brotherly in slovenian 
politics 
slovenian politicians believe milosevic wants to provoke a 
showdown with slovenia to impose his own brand of ideological 
orthodoxy on all of yugoslavia and prevent moves toward a 
multiparty system 
yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its 
oneparty system with a comparatively free press and no travel 
restrictions 
but its political economic and social problems have mushroomed 
since the death in 1980 of president josip broz tito who founded 
the modern yugoslav federation in 1943

the attorney for a policeman who shot a black 
motorcyclist pleaded with jurors today to consider only the facts 
in the officers manslaughter trial not the impact their verdict 
might have on race relations 
the city has girded itself against a repeat of the racial 
violence that raged for three days after colombianborn officer 
william lozano 31 shot and killed clement lloyd on jan 16 as the 
motorcyclist sped away from a patrol car lloyds passenger allan 
blanchard died of injuries suffered in the motorcycle crash 
this case has nothing to do with racial prejudice said 
defense attorney roy black giving his closing argument in a low 
measured tone your verdict has meaning only in its truth to the 
case and its effects on a police officer no one here is trying to 
cause any further problems all we are seeking is the truth in this 
case 
earlier the prosecution argued that lozano could have avoided a 
confrontation before the shooting it was not a lifeordeath 
situation for lozano prosecutor don horn told jurors it was 
not a splitsecond decision 
horn said all of the prosecution witnesses had heard the 
motorcycle approaching from at least a block away while lozano 
claimed he never noticed it until it was almost upon him 
he stepped out there he decided he was going to shoot and he 
shot horn said all he had to do was step behind the police 
car 
lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter and faces a 
maximum of 30 years in jail on each count 
jurors would have to decide if lozano acted as a reasonably 
cautious and prudent police officer horn said 
horn then reviewed arguments on both sides with the intent of 
showing that lozano was not threatened by the motorcyclist and did 
not have to shoot him in selfdefense 
attorneys predicted the case could be in the hands of the jurors 
by the end of the day 
on two previous occasions in this decade riots broke out when 
white officers were acquitted in the slayings of blacks 
prosecutors say lloyd fired unnecessarily as the motorcycle 
passed him at a safe distance the defense argues that lozano fired 
only at the last second to protect his life as the motorcycle bore 
down on him in the wrong lane 
jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began nov 
15 the trial opened oct 23 but it took more than three weeks to 
seat a jury of two blacks one hispanic and three nonhispanic 
whites 
following the close of testimony monday the judge and lawyers 
for both sides hashed out instructions to be given to the jury 
before deliberations 
the prosecution won efforts to exclude much of floridas 
fleeing felon law from the instructions the law allows police 
to fire on suspected criminals but dade circuit judge joseph 
farina disallowed it on grounds that lozano never testified he was 
trying to make an arrest at the time of the shooting 
the defense won an instruction that if lloyd was committing 
aggravated assault which can include causing a wellfounded 
fear of death or injury lozano could be found innocent for 
shooting him 
defense attorneys rested their case earlier monday after rolling 
a kawasaki ninja motorcycle similar to lloyds into the courtroom 
attorney mark seiden had an expert testify about the cycles 
measurements to show the bullet could have entered lloyds head at 
an angle as the autopsy showed even if the bike was headed 
directly at the officer 
the defense also put officer felix martinez on the stand to 
testify about a 1988 incident in which lozano allegedly forced a 
mans head into the officers chest during an argument the 
prosecution claims the incident shows lozano had a hot temper when 
his authority was challenged but the defense claims the story was 
made up 
the motorcycle shooting occurred on martin luther kings 
birthday as miami began a week of celebration leading up to the 
super bowl lozano and his partner dawn campbell were stopped on a 
street in a black neighborhood 
another squad car was chasing down lloyds motorcycle which 
raced past the street where lozano stood the officer fired one 
shot killing lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing 
into a car 
within an hour after the shooting an angry crowd gathered at 
the scene and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles 
the violence spread by the time it ended three days later one 
looter had been shot to death 11 people were wounded by gunfire 
and 13 buildings were burned down in the overtown and liberty city 
neighborhoods

peace talks between rebels and the 
sudanese government collapsed tuesday in disagreement over the 
countrys islamic legal code and other issues that have kept them 
at war for nearly seven years 
in my opinion neither side came to nairobi prepared to take 
the difficult steps necessary for peace said former president 
jimmy carter who acted as an unofficial mediator in the five days 
of negotiations 
both sides at the end seemed ready to emphasize their 
differences postpone further action and let the war continue 
carter said there is no telling how many hundreds of thousands 
of people will die because these two sides have failed to reach an 
agreement 
both carter and lam akol the chief negotiator for the sudan 
peoples liberation army said the talks broke down mainly over the 
governments failure to address the question of sudans sharia law 
a harsh islamic legal code 
the governments chief spokesman abdel samie omer ahmed 
disagreed he said the talks had not broken down but were merely 
postponed to give his delegation a chance to confer with the 
government 
no date was given for further negotiations 
carter said he proposed the sudanese government set aside the 
sharia law from the beginning of a ceasefire until the convening 
of a constitutional conference to write a new basic framework of 
law for the african nation 
if the government would do that and only that i believe 
peace would come carter said im not asking them to cancel 
it to abrogate it im just asking them to set it aside for a few 
months 
he said the rebels had agreed to abide by sharia law if it were 
established as part of the legal code by a broadbased 
constitutional convention 
the chief rebel negotiator said the two sides also had 
fundamental divergences on the state of emergency in effect in 
sudan since 1983 and the countrys military pacts with egypt and 
libya 
but akol made it clear the rebels view the islamic law which 
imposes such penalties as cutting off a hand for petty theft as 
the chief stumbling block 
they have to move on sharia law he said 
the rebels took up arms in 1983 to press the moslemdominated 
government for greater political autonomy and larger economic 
benefits for the largely christian southern half of sudan 
the war has brought widespread famine to the south the united 
nations estimated that 250000 people died in the region in 1988

the national family farm coalition has a 
proposal for the 1990 farm bill it says would strengthen family 
farms while eliminating the need for deficiency payment subsidies 
at a news conference monday members of the coalition presented 
a plan that also would encourage sustainable agriculture or what 
is commonly called organic farming 
for grain handlers and shippers and for food processors the 
1985 farm bill has ensured record profits said the coalitions 
statement for over 400000 farm and ranch families who left the 
land between 1985 and 1988 and their rural communities that farm 
program has been a disaster 
the coalition says their model farm bill would 
allow farmers to earn their income from the marketplace by 
raising price support levels to cover the cost of production 
establish a farmer commodity reserve that would ensure against 
natural disaster and cushion the economic risk of changing from 
chemical to sustainable methods 
ensure through production management and a commodity reserve a 
stable supply of grain for domestic foreign trade and food 
assistance programs 
there is a growing concern among farmers consumers and in 
congress that farm commodities be grown with few chemicals said 
the coalitions statement 
the groups proposal would give farmers a two to fiveyear 
economic cushion while switching from herbicides and pesticides to 
sustainable methods through access to reserve crops

the national resources inventory shows that 
sheet and rill erosion on cropland decreased by a halfton per acre 
nationwide between 1982 and 1987 dropping from 43 tons to 38 
tons per acre a year 
however wind erosion on cropland increased 01 ton per acre to 
33 tons per acre a year said the report from the agriculture 
departments soil conservation service that was issued monday 
according to the data sheet and rill erosion nationwide totals 
16 billion tons per year and wind erosion 14 billion tons 
annually 
the survey reveals impressive gains for soil conservation 
said the center for resource economics a washingtonbased 
nonprofit environmental research and publishing organization 
but the research also shows that soil erosion is still a serious 
problem it said in a statement 
from everything we know about land use in the mid1970s 
erosion conditions worsened with the onset of the export boom 
said ken cook vice president of the center 
he said analysis of the survey data may show that the 
improvement in erosion control is due substantially to massive 
idling of cropland under government programs between 1984 and 1987 
the agriculture department said the report does not reflect the 
work under way on about 140 million acres of highly erodible land 
as part of the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law

armenians trapped their lawmakers in their 
chambers for hours today and then went on strike to demand stronger 
action against moscows bid to end a territorial dispute an 
activist said 
thousands of people surrounded the supreme soviet chambers in 
yerevan the armenian capital monday night and refused to let the 
lawmakers out until 5 am karen shakhbazyan said 
when only 49 of 315 legislators showed up five hours later for 
the morning legislative session yerevan factory workers went on 
strike he said by telephone from the city 
the lawmakers spent monday debating a proposal to drop the words 
soviet socialist from armenias official name and call it 
simply the armenian republic 
the legislators did not decide that issue or a call for them to 
boycott a session of the national congress of peoples deputies 
when it meets in moscow dec 12 
the people are demanding that they decide the issue 
shakhbazyan said 
many armenians want the lawmakers to boycott the national 
legislative session in defiance of moscows position over the 
disputed nagornokarabakh region 
last week the armenian legislature declared the republic would 
annex the enclave which is predominantly armenian and christian 
but part of neighboring azerbaijan which is mostly moslem 
nagornokarabakh is called an autonomous region but it is 
supposed to obey the azerbaijan government 
dozens of people have been killed in the past 18 months in 
violence stemming from the territorial dispute 
moscow is unlikely to recognize the armenian annexation 
the federal supreme soviet put nagornokarabakh under the direct 
rule of moscow last year but did away with that arrangement on nov 
28 
it directed azerbaijan to work with local officials to solve 
mounting social economic and political problems in the enclave 
both armenians and azerbaijanis have said they are dissatisfied 
with that decision

the economic damage from the ongoing 
coup attempt will last well beyond the final echoes of rival troops 
exchanging gunfire in the heart of the embattled makati financial 
district 
less than a week after rebel soldiers launched a bid to topple 
president corazon aquino officials are talking about serious 
damage to efforts to attract foreign investment to this struggling 
nation 
the cost of the attempted coup was high not only in life and 
property but in terms of investments said sen john osmena 
tourism will dry up for the next year the economic recovery has 
been stalled 
political unrest is never good news for national economies but 
this sixth coup attempt against mrs aquinos government spells 
particular trouble because the main battlefield has been the 
countrys financial center including three luxury hotels filled 
with wealthy foreign guests 
the countrys two stock exchanges are located in makati and have 
been unable to operate since the coup attempt began friday 
business sources say the exchanges are considering waiting a day or 
two after order is restored before reopening for fear that share 
prices in the opening hours will collapse 
banks and shopping centers in makati are believed to have 
suffered substantial damage in recent fighting which broke out 
during what should have been the height of the christmas sales rush 
among the foreigners held hostage in makati hotels are leading 
taiwan industrialists including jeffrey koo the powerful 
president of the china trust co ltd and japanese investors the 
type of people with the capital needed to help fuel fuel economic 
growth in the philippines 
the japanese have really been terrorized there in makati 
house speaker ramon mitra said monday many of them are 
investors can you imagine the damage this will bring 
sony corp of japan has said the company may postpone 
construction of an audio equipment plant if the philippines seems 
headed for more instability 
manila can ill afford squeamishness on the part of cashrich 
taiwan which had 133 million in approved investment in the 
philippines in the first three quarters of 1989 up from 109 
million for all of 1988 
if the situation continues to deteriorate the major investors 
may withdraw their investment chi minshen an official of 
taiwans official industrial deveopment and investment center said 
in taipei on tuesday 
taiwan businessmen would not risk their lives for whatever 
incentives or privileges are offered he said referring to tax 
breaks and market access concessions that manila offers to attract 
overseas investors 
the manila fighting also comes just after mrs aquinos trip to 
canada and the united states to seek new investment in her many 
appearances before north american business groups mrs aquino 
assured wouldbe investors the philippines was stable even as her 
adversaries were finalizing plans for a coup 
last week mrs aquino said foreign investment is increasing 
because the message has got through that the country is politically 
stable and the daily danger of coups is long past 
in fact the philippines has chalked up some respectable 
economic statistics in the first nine months of 1989 the real 
gross domestic product rose 6 percent from the same period a year 
earlier 
investing in the country can be profitable the hong kongbased 
jardine flemings philippine trust rose 183 percent in the first 10 
months this year and more than 2000 percent in the past five years 
manila and other southeast asian capitals have long sought to 
parlay cheap labor and abundant natural resources to create their 
own economic miracles to follow the trailblazing path set by asias 
dynamic little dragons of south korea taiwan hong kong and 
singapore 
to what degree the coup attempt will derail such plans remains 
to be seen philippine officials clearly hope the damage can be 
contained 
there is no doubt that investments will be affected as a 
result of the events that have transpired but i would like to look 
at that as something temporary said trade secretary jose 
concepcion we have to give assurances to foreign investors that 
this is the last coup

the bulgarian constitution now guarantees the communists a 
leading role in society 
its difficult for me to predict in what particular way this 
issue will be resolved but i foresee changes in the 
constitution mladenov said 
he said a constitutional commission of which he is chairman will 
make recommendations to bulgarias parliament at the end of the 
month 
the communist parties of some of bulgarias east bloc partners 
including czechoslovakia and east germany have given up their 
constitutional monopoly on power in the face of popular demands for 
democratic reforms

years of rule by todor zhivkov 
mladenov attended the warsaw pact meeting held monday in moscow

white house officials said today there is no 
policy difference between president bush and vice president dan 
quayle over the intentions of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
we have an administration that is very closely aligned but i 
think its probably not possible for people to speak literally with 
one voice and there may be a difference in perspective but 
theres no difference with the policies were pursuing national 
security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters 
quayle in an interview seemed to take a more negative view of 
the soviet union than bush telling the washington post that the 
kremlins foreign policy does not appear to have changed despite 
improved relations with the west 
youre still dealing with a totalitarian government that 
wants to create instability in other nations quayle said in 
the interview published today 
his comments came a day after bush returned from his 
mediterranean summit meeting with gorbachev and said that in view 
of developments the west must adopt new thinking toward the 
soviets 
my viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the 
area of economics i dont think theyve changed much in foreign 
policy quayle said 
there is no policy difference between the two men scowcroft 
said 
he and white house press secretary marlin fitzwater pointed out 
that bush remained critical of the soviet role in central america 
scowcroft said he was convinced there was no confusion on the 
part of gorbachev as to what is us policy 
fitzwater said bush and quayle had discussed the post interview 
this morning when they met but that bush doesnt feel theres 
any need for concern 
quayle has taken a tougher line in the past in his public 
comments on the soviet union than other administration officials 
and the interview contrasted with bushs generally upbeat 
assessment of the weekends superpower summit 
quayle told the post the soviets have very significant 
interests beyond their borders and those interests create 
instability 
we cannot count on the soviets out of the goodness of their 
hearts in alleviating those tensions for us 
but quayle said he viewed continuing changes in eastern europe 
as reflecting soviet domestic policy 
though gorbachev has been very helpful in spurring communist 
governments in eastern europe to reform i dont view that as a 
matter of foreign policy as much as domestic policy 
but quayle said he hadnt seen any evidence of their 
slackening off aid to cuba and nicaragua 
on the summit meeting of president bush and gorbachev quayle 
said he thought a strategic arms agreement is something that could 
be achieved on the timetable agreed to by the two leaders 
bush told a news conference in brussels on monday the west 
stands at the threshold of a new era but he declined to endorse 
gorbachevs suggestion that the cold war is over that day hasnt 
arrived bush said

international business machines corp announced 
today it would cut 10000 us jobs without layoffs as it copes 
with slow growth in the us market 
the worlds largest computer company said it would set aside 
23 billion from its pretax earnings for the fourthquarter to 
cover costs of employee buyouts and restructuring ibm said it 
would reduce its staff by limiting hiring and offering incentives 
to employees to quit or retire early 
the company did not announce any closings of facilities and john 
akers the chairman and chief executive said he did not expect any 
ibm also announced a program to buy back up to 4 billion of its 
own stock which has lost more than a third of its value since its 
1987 peak 
with the company costcutting to improve profitability ibms 
stock rose 2 a share to 10125 at midday today on the new york 
stock exchange after a 212 a share rise on monday when 
speculation intensified that the company planned to cut jobs 
the stocks peak price was 17587 in august 1987 
ibm expanded dramatically in the early 1980s but has been 
cutting back since 1985 when it became apparent that the 
industrys rapid 15 percent annual growth was slowing 
ibm said its growth overseas was strong but the us business 
still was growing more slowly than desired 
the actions we are describing today underscore our ongoing 
resolve to make ibm the most competitive information processing 
business in an industry that continues to grow akers said in a 
statement 
ibm has a 40year tradition of no layoffs in a meeting today 
with securities analysts akers said the company intended to keep 
that tradition because it helped the company maintain a 
highquality flexible and dedicated workforce 
he added its impossible to guarantee for all time full 
employment under any and all circumstances 
the company said its 4 billion stock buyback in combination 
with a 1 billion buyback authorized in october if completed would 
bring total repurchases since mid1986 to more than 105 billion 
that amounts to about 15 percent of the shares outstanding at that 
time possibly the biggest repurchase program ever undertaken 
the job cuts are intended to reduce the companys us workforce 
to 206000 by the end of 1990 a reduction of more than 37000 from 
1985 levels 
the 23 billion pretax charge against fourthquarter earnings 
breaks down as follows 
500 million for separation payments to people leaving the 
company 
500 million for accounting changes to speed up the way ibm 
logs its payment for software and technology investments 
13 billion for restructuring including consolidations 
capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of special 
investments such as share ownership in other companies

a federal grand jury today indicted two 
associates of jim bakker for lying during the ptl fraud 
investigation 
sam johnson former minister at heritage village church was 
charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony about a 10000 
check that was part of 265000 in hush money paid to former church 
secretary jessica hahn 
evangelist john wesley fletcher was charged with one count of 
perjury for his testimony about how bakker was introduced to miss 
hahn 
there will be no further ptlrelated indictments coming out 
this grand jury said assistant us attorney jerry miller 
fletcher introduced bakker to miss hahn before their sexual 
encounter at a florida motel room reports that bakker used 
ministry funds to pay miss hahn to keep quiet about the liaison led 
to bakkers resignation in march 1987 
johnson who runs heritage ministries of charlotte the 
nonprofit ministry created by a federal bankruptcy court after the 
decline of ptl was not immediately available for comment his 
secretary pam jewett said johnson was taping a christmas tv 
special at a resort in the north carolina mountains 
we were very surprised by the indictment she said 
fletcher who was arrested twice within four hours last week on 
drunken driving charges in durham where he lives could not be 
immediately located for comment 
the indictments were issued about three hours after richard 
dortch jim bakkers former secondincommand at the bankrupt 
ministry arrived at the federal courthouse 
dortch who pleaded guilty in august to fraud and conspiracy 
charges for his role in the ptl affair would not comment on the 
grand jury as he entered the courthouse with his son richard 
dortch jr 
asked if he would talk with reporters after his appearance 
dortch said silence is wisdom dortchs attorney mark 
calloway also made no comment 
as expected the new grand jury probe focused on people who 
allegedly committed perjury in appearances before the special grand 
jury that indicted dortch and bakker a year ago the original 
indictments in the ptl case were handed down on dec 5 1988 
bakker is serving a 45year term in a federal prison in 
minnesota after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges 
bakker is appealing the conviction but a panel of the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals refused to free bakker on bond while the 
appeal was prepared 
on oct 5 bakker was convicted by a jury on all 24 counts of 
fraud and conspiracy for bilking faithful followers who sent him 
158 million for partnerships in the ministry entitling them to 
annual lodging guarantees prosecutors said bakker diverted 37 
million in ptl money to buy expensive homes cars jewelry and 
vacations 
dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined 
200000 his plea agreement enables the former assemblies of god 
minister to remain free until federal authorities no longer require 
his cooperation the plea agreement for dortch included a provision 
that he would be required to report to prison no sooner than jan 
15 as long as he cooperated with prosecutors 
the fate of the ministrys heritage usa religious theme park and 
hotel complex is in the hands of a bankruptcy court judge in 
columbia sc the complex in fort mill sc south of charlotte

california sea lions that prey on steelhead and 
salmon at a seattle fish ladder could be caught and sent back to 
breeding grounds off southern california ahead of time this winter 
under new government recommendations 
sea lions normally would eat their way through the winter then 
head south in the summer 
an environmental assessment issued monday by the national marine 
fisheries service and the washington state wildlife department 
favored capturing the sea lions at the ballard locks and sending 
them back to the channel islands about 30 to 40 miles off santa 
barbara rather than doing nothing or killing the marine mammals 
the report rejected killing or the lethal removal 
alternative largely because of the need to prepare an 
environmental impact statement and review potential legal policy 
and technical issues 
some segments of the public would be opposed to lethally 
removing even a limited number of problem animals the report 
said 
the animals find easy pickings at the bottom of a fish ladder at 
the ballard lock the sole passage for valuable salmon and 
steelhead a seagoing rainbow trout to reach lake washington and 
upstream spawning grounds 
the 500 to 600pound animals gorge themselves and severely 
deplete the number of fish that succeed in getting upstream to 
spawn even two to five sea lions can easily account for 
predation of over 400 fish the report said 
federal officials expect 40 to 60 sea lions would have to be 
removed 
the animals have flourished since passage of the federal marine 
mammals protection act of 1972 and now number more than 177000 
animals 
removal would have so little impact that an environmental impact 
statement is unnecessary the report said 
efforts to preserve fish runs through the lake washington 
shipping canal by using firecrackers rubber bullets nets playing 
of recorded sounds harassment by boat and foultasting fish to 
change the sea lions dining preferences all have failed in recent 
years 
last year 39 sea lions were trapped two died and the rest were 
released near the mouth of the columbia river 
thirteen returned to the locks a journey of about 200 miles or 
roughly onefifth the distance between seattle and the channel 
islands in an average of 15 days 
doing nothing would result in continued loss of as much as 70 
percent of the number of wild steelhead needed for spawning in the 
sammamish and cedar rivers the study found 
in 198889 sea lions let less than 700 fish through to spawn 
about 900 less than what wildlife officials set as a target 
joe scordino of the federal agency said capture and removal to 
california could begin by the end of the month or early january at 
a cost of as much as 150000 to 175000 
public comment on the plan is being solicited through dec 15 
but only court action or an administrative denial of funding could 
block the effort he said 
in california fishing interests and some state officials have 
voiced strong opposition to the proposal rolland a schmitten 
northwest regional director of the national marine fisheries 
service said he hoped to persuade them the plan would have no more 
than an inconsequential effect in their state 
we dont want to ram anything down anybodys throat

partys victory drew allegations of fraud and led to a clash 
between police and opposition supporters 
in taipei newspaper reports said about 12 percent of the votes 
cast in saturdays islandwide election were bogus central 
election commission officials refused comment on the reports 
the vote the first multiparty election in taiwans history 
dealt the nationalist party its worst setback in 40 years in power 
nationalists lost several important local elections and garnered 58 
percent of the total vote down from 70 percent in 1986 
during the election and raucous campaign the opposition party 
accused the nationalists of widespread vote buying and ballot box 
stuffing 
those allegations were strongest in tainan a largely 
agricultural county in southern taiwan where a nationalist and an 
opposition democratic progressive party candidate were in a close 
race for the county executive post one of the highest elected 
offices in taiwan 
about 10000 opposition supporters screaming for a recount 
packed a square next to county government offices in tainan on 
tuesday 
clubwielding protesters discovered five plainclothes policemen 
in their midst and beat them police said the officers disguised 
as journalists were stripped of their cameras which were tossed 
into a nearby swimming pool police said 
police grabbed and beat one protester with clubs 
witnesses said several protesters were injured police said at 
least two people were hospitalized 
the crowd soon swelled as thousands of protesters armed with 
clubs and stones flocked to the square about 2000 riot police 
cordoned off the square and set up water cannons 
huang hsinchieh chairman of the opposition democratic 
progressive party went to tainan and asked the county government 
for a recount of the roughly 200000 votes 
after hours of negotiations the government agreed to a recount 
in the presence of opposition officials officials said the outcome 
would be known wednesday 
according to official results nationalist candidate lee 
yachiao defeated opposition candidate lee tsungfan by 9000 votes 
county executives wield wide powers over police schools and the 
economy of their constituencies and are among the highest elected 
officials here 
in saturdays voting the opposition won six of 15 county 
executive seats not including the controversial tainan seat in 
1986 the opposition won two 
in the capital newspaper reports said 814000 votes were 
invalidated fewer than 7 million people voted 
in the central city of nantou about 400 demonstrators ended an 
overnight sitin tuesday after authorities promised an 
investigation of alleged vote buying 
a nationalist official wu tunyi said he would disembowel 
myself if there was any vote rigging

respect for polishborn pope john paul ii with whom he had an 
unprecedented meeting in rome on friday 
mr gorbachev put a great emphasis on the fact that it had 
been a very very interesting meeting for him mazowiecki said 
jaruzelski commenting to pap on the warsaw pact meeting said 
it is true the participants were different to a large extent 
the leaderships have changed in many countries of course we were

the warsaw treaty states leaders in which i had an opportunity to 
participate mazowiecki said of the resolution

president bush called british prime minister 
margaret thatcher today to reassure her the united states has not 
changed its position about a unified european market meanwhile 
the white house said there may be a difference in tone but not in 
substance in the way bush and vice president dan quayle assess 
the superpower summit 
bush told nato leaders in brussels on monday that the united 
states supports an integrated europe his remarks were seen in some 
quarters as a prod to mrs thatcher who has objected to a common 
european currency and other aspects of unification 
bush believes that a stronger europe is good for the united 
states but the details and timing of the integration are up to the 
europeans themselves brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser said today 
scowcroft also tried to play down apparent differences between 
bush and quayle about the soviet unions foreign policy 
the issue arose from an interview in which quayle said it would 
be a mistake to view the malta summit as a sign that soviet foreign 
policy had changed 
i think its probably not possible for people to speak 
literally with one voice scowcroft told reporters 
i dont think theyve changed much in foreign policy quayle 
told the washington post as bush flew home from talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the briefing in brussels for 
allied leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization 
in contrast bush said after the summit we stand at the 
threshold of a brand new era of ussoviet relations and that 
gorbachevs acceptance of dramatic reforms in eastern europe 
absolutely mandates new thinking by the west 
discussing the skeptical stand taken by quayle scowcroft said 
there may seem at times to be a difference of perspective but 
theres no difference in the substance of the policies were 
pursuing 
bush was briefing his cabinet today on his weekend summit in 
malta with gorbachev 
as soon as he got to his private white house quarters monday 
night bush called philippine president corazon aquino to express 
concern for the lives of americans trapped in hotels in manila by 
rebel forces trying to overthrow her 
bush paid tribute to her courage in seeking to quell the 
rebellion white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said mrs 
aquino fitzwater said assured bush her government was doing 
everything possible to protect americans 
bush in a concession to possible jet lag from transatlantic 
travel pushed back his schedule one hour today receiving his 
daily intelligence briefing in the oval office at 9 am instead of 
8 am 
bush was in high spirits monday after giving nato leaders an 
assessment of the summit asked at a news conference why he risked 
riding on a navy launch through 6foot waves after talks with 
gorbachev bush jokingly said you know these charismatic macho 
visionary guys theyll do anything 
on a more serious note bush said he assured the allies the 
united states would maintain significant military forces in 
europe as long as our allies desire our presence 
at the same time bush said he would kick our bureaucracy 
and urge other western countries to complete work on a treaty 
between nato and the warsaw pact to reduce troops tanks artillery 
and other conventional forces in europe by next year 
bush told nato leaders he hoped a multinational summit could be 
convened in europe next summer to sign such an accord 
he said he wants that treaty in the bank before seeking 
deeper reductions negotiators working on the accord in the 
austrian capital are making brisk progress but several issues are 
unresolved most significantly a dispute over the kind of soviet 
airplanes to be scrapped 
gorbachevs grip on power has been questioned in light of the 
dramatic upheaval in his oncesolid communist empire and the 
failure of his reform programs to ease shortages of food and other 
goods 
asked if gorbachev acted like a man in jeopardy bush said he 
seemed very much in control you could tell the way he interacted 
with his own top people there and he felt very confident in 
discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me 
searching for a way to describe the kremlin leaders attitude 
bush said that subdued is the wrong word but i would say 
determined and unemotional about it 
other members of bushs delegation remarked that gorbachev 
seemed low key in comparison with his demeanor at summits with 
former president reagan 
bush said he hoped the west could take steps to ease soviet 
economic woes 
we want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs 
help im thinking of a few suggestions i had in the economic 
area he said but i also believe that the west must remain 
strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united 
way but not be imprudent 
bush said it wasnt all sweetness and light between himself 
and gorbachev mentioning they disagreed over central america 
however bush said as i watched the way in which mr 
gorbachev has handled the changes in eastern europe it deserves 
new thinking it absolutely mandates new thinking 
bush also commended gorbachev for supporting a conventional arms 
treaty that would require the warsaw pact to disproportionately 
reduce his forces to bring them down to natos level 
when i hear him talk about peaceful change and the right of 
countries to choose countries in the warsaw pact to choose that 
deserves new thinking bush said

an avianca airliner that blew up with 
107 people aboard last month was destroyed by a bomb placed in a 
seat near the fuel tanks a colombian cabinet minister said today 
all members of a crash investigation team agreed that the boeing 
727 was destroyed by a bomb minister of government carlos lemos 
simmonds said at a news conference 
lemos did not say who may have placed the bomb but suspicion 
has fallen on colombias drug traffickers who had been bombing 
banks restaurants hotels schools and other public places 
before the airliner was bombed 201 bombs had exploded over the 
previous three months in major colombian cities killing 29 people 
and injuring 238 
earlier lemos had suggested that drug traffickers were 
responsible for the nov 27 crash that killed all those aboard 
the jet exploded minutes after taking off from bogotas 
international airport on its way to the southern city of cali 
a man had called caracol radio and claimed responsibility for 
the crash on behalf of the extraditables a terrorist group linked 
to the medellin cocaine cartel 
the man said the group destroyed the plane in retaliation for a 
police raid on the hideout of pablo escobar a leader of the 
medellin cartel on nov 22 caracol later said it doubted the 
callers authenticity 
all of the technicians who took part in the investigation 
agreed without exception that it was the work of criminals and that 
an explosive device was placed in a seat near the gasoline tanks 
lemos said 
the bogota daily el espectador quoting a report by colombias 
civil aeronautics authority said the bomb was in seat 15f along 
the right side of the plane

columbias fiveperson crew is to deploy a navy communications 
satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to earth a 
science satellite that has orbited earth nearly six years 
dec 18 which has been a launch target for some time became 
official at the conclusion of a twoday flight readiness review by 
shuttle managers 
a statement announcing the date noted that a new mobile launch 
platform and a modified launch pad 39a are being used for the first 
time 
due to work on these facilities there is a higher than normal 
probability of developing problems that might result in a short 
delay to the launch date the statement said 
minor problems have cropped up in fitting the shuttle to the new 
facilities since columbia moved to the pad last week 
weve got a good shot at making the 18th if the pad work goes 
smoothly said space agency spokesman ed campion he said if 
problems do crop up he expected the delay would be minimal a 
day or two 
pad 39a was the launch base for the first 24 shuttle missions 
but has not been used in nearly four years workers recently 
completed a twoyear 50 million overhaul to improve safety 
electrical fuel line environmental control and other systems 
all seven launches since shuttle flights resumed 15 months ago 
have been from neighboring pad 39b the program was grounded for 32 
months after the 1986 challenger explosion 
if there were a delay of several days shuttle managers 
discussed options to avoid launching on christmas day so most 
workers could have the holiday off campion said under study are a 
plan to launch a day or two after christmas and another that would 
put the flight off until after new years day 
astronaut dan brandenstein will command columbias crew the 
others are pilot jim wetherbee and mission specialists bonnie

the government told school administrators 
nationwide tuesday that poor maintenance and improper operation may 
cause certain indoor bleachers to collapse 
investigations reveal that if the bleachers are not opened 
properly andor maintained correctly over a period of time the 
bleachers may collapse the consumer product safety commission 
said in a statement 
the commission said recent collapses of school gymnasium 
bleachers prompted the warning which involves manual telescoping 
bleachers made from 1966 to 1979 by michiganbased interkal and 
sold under the trade names brunswick vecta and 
interkal 
the agency said that 16 collapses since 1978 have produced back 
arm leg and ankle injuries some serious 
last spring nine people were injured when a section of a 
bleacher collapsed during a graduation ceremony at a colorado high 
school eightythree students were injured in september 1988 when 
bleachers collapsed at a maryland high school officials determined 
that structural failure caused the collapse 
francis hubbel president of interkal acknowledged that the 
bleachers at issue dont have certain failsafe features built 
in he said the bleachers were redesigned in 1979 
the old design is working but requires a high level of care 
by owners hubbel added in a telephone interview 
the company which manufactures half of all indoor school 
bleachers has sent more than 3000 schools operating manuals and 
safety stickers to be affixed to the bleachers hubbel said 
he recommended school personnel trayoollerating the bleachers 
inspect the structures each time they are 
used 
he also said the bleachers should be inspected annually by 
authorized and trained professionals preferably the person who 
installed them 
many of these bleachers are very old and very safe while 
others have developed some problems said hubbel 
he said the age of the bleachers was not relevant in determining 
the chances of collapse 
we have seen bleachers that are five years old that have been 
in prethome 30yerold bleachers that are in good 
shape hubbel saidq4fety co said scjools should tajethe

inspect the bleachers for indications of damage wear and

prime minister margaret thatcher today comfortably 
defeated an unprecedented challenge to her leadership of the 
conservative party but failed to crush all traces of rebellion 
she got the votes of 314 of her 374 members of parliament while 
33 opposed her and 24 abstained three failed to vote 
that meant 57 lawmakers or 15 percent refused to support her 
and the figure provoked conflicting initial assessments 
anything below 50 would have been an absolute triumph i think 
57 is a bloody good result said norman tebbit a thatcher ally 
and former party chairman 
i think it is a troublesome result for her said john cole 
bbctvs political editor broadcasting the result live to the 
nation from the house of commons 
mrs thatcher who has been reelected unopposed every year 
since she became party leader in 1974 was challenged by sir 
anthony meyer 69 a littleknown outsider who put up his candidacy 
to rally antithatcher sentiment 
the consensus had been that if 100 or more failed to support 
her mrs thatcher would have been badly damaged while anything 
under 45 would be an unassailable vote of confidence in her 
meyer conceded that the prime minister already 10 years in 
office was entitled to feel pretty pleased with the result 
meyer had sought to rally opposition to mrs thatchers handling 
of the economy her tough style of leadership and her reluctance 
to integrate britain deeper into the european economic community 
mrs thatcher has run unopposed in the annual vote since she 
ousted edward heath as party leader after the tories lost the 1974 
general election to the labor party 
she came to power when the conservatives won the 1979 general 
election she is in her third term as prime minister following tory 
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections she is the 
longest serving prime minister this century

the cold weather that swept through new england 
faster than usual this year caught endangered sea turtles before 
they could migrate to the gulf of mexico leaving some dead or 
dying on cape cod beaches 
waves have tossed a record number of turtle bodies onto the 
sandy beaches of cape cod said robert prescott director of the 
massachusetts audobon societys wellfleet bay wildlife sanctuary 
several species of turtles feed in cape cod bay during the 
summer then migrate to warm gulf beaches to nest 
turtles can stand water as low as 45 degrees before they slow 
down and stiffen said diane reynolds an administrative assistant 
who has worked at the wellfleet sanctuary for seven years tuesday 
the water at the nantucket shoals was 45 degrees according to the 
national weather service 
eight dead or neardead turtles most from the endangered 
species list were reported found last week the most since a 
fiveday record set in 1985 prescott said 
the turtles include four ridleys an endangered species and one 
loggerhead a species considered threatened or slightly less rare 
than ridleys three others including a hawksbill turtle rarely 
seen this far north were found dead reynolds said tuesday 
the turtles were taken to the new england aquarium where rescue 
teams nurse the listless reptiles back to health so they can be 
flown south for further therapy 
at the aquarium the turtles live in a heated pool and 
assistants ply them with green crab squid and pieces of fish 
though the rescued turtles have not yet started to eat they are 
doing about as well as can be expected said vikki corliss a 
spokeswoman for the aquarium 
theyre not running relay races thats for sure she said 
but they move around the pool they are responding to a degree 
considering they are coldstunned 
corliss said it could take a couple of weeks for the turtles to 
recover then they will be flown to aquariums in north carolina or 
florida for additional care before they are eventually released 
prescott said 
rescuing the ridley turtles would be a particular victory 
because of their endangered status prescott said only 600 female 
ridley turtles were counted last year at their nesting site along 
the northern mexican coast in 1947 40000 nesting females were 
counted 
reynolds said man is the biggest threat to ridleys and other 
turtles 
turtles suffer from the destruction of beachfront property 
poachers said reynolds poachers eat them turn their shells 
into jewelry sell them as souvenirs they eat the eggs

changes in the earths climate could encourage 
the spread of diseases like encephalitis and rabies while at the 
same time damaging the human bodys ability to fight them a 
conference on climate and health was told tuesday 
potential problems stem both from the increase in ultraviolet 
radiation as the protective ozone layer in the stratsophere is 
damaged and from climate warming which many scientists believe is 
occurring in a socalled greenhouse effect 
ultraviolet radiation already known to cause skin cancer also 
has a major effect in reducing the response of the human immune 
system said dr raymond daynes of the university of utah 
there is really no advantage to sunbathing your skin is 
really not meant to withstand ultraviolet radiation daynes told 
the conference on global atmospheric change and public health 
ultraviolet radiation he said in addition to being a potent 
carcinogen appears able to modify or suppress the immune 
system 
levels of ultraviolet radiation are considered likely to 
increase as ozone is depleted in the upper atmosphere where 
manmade chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons destroy the 
protective layer already a seasonal reduction in ozone known as 
an ozone hole occurs at the south pole 
at the same time this immune system damage is being threatened 
warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseases 
currently limited by the climate added dr robert e shope of the 
yale university school of medicine 
and dr susanne holmes giannini of the university of maryland 
school of medicine added that ultraviolet radiation also increases 
the effects of many diseases that affect the skin or start on the 
skin 
skin disesases such as leprosy smallpox skin ulcers and 
infections and herpes could be worsened by increases in radiation 
she said as could diseases that enter the body through the skin 
such as anthrax bubonic plague yaws some types of diptheria 
african sleeping sickness and others 
in one series of tests she said mice infected with what is 
normally a skin disease developed fewer skin ulcers under 
ultraviolet radiation but between 15 percent and 40 percent of 
them died thus she concluded ultraviolet radiation seems able to 
convert one normally nonfatal disease into a fatal one 
most human infectious diseases will probably not be greatly 
influenced by climate change said shope but he added those 
affected by climate such as diseases carried by mosquitoes likely 
will be 
the change is hard to predict without known how much or how fast 
climate will change he said noting that while the greenhouse 
effect is widely discussed scientists disagree over whether it has 
actually begun and how much warming might occur 
if there is a warmer climate said shope possible problems 
might include the spread of batborne rabies as vampire bats from 
south and central america extend their range to the north spread 
of dengue and yellow fever and an increase in st louis 
encephalitis 
normally that form of encephalitis which is particularly 
serious in older people occurs in an epidemic every decade or so 
the last one having been in 1975 
mosquitoes breeding in sewage spread the disease he said and 
warm dry years favor its expansion 
other diseases causes by parasites might also spread he said 
but he added that there is no way of predicting exactly which 
diseases may expand which could be reduced or when

us jewish leaders tuesday gave 
president richard von weizsaecker an award for urging people not to 
forget the nazi years but they expressed concern about rightwing 
extremism should the germanys unite 
weizsaecker was the first german to receive the antidefamation 
leagues joseph prize for human rights the president is known for 
speeches reminding west germans never to forget the nazi years and 
calling on them to guard against a revival of fascism 
this is for me a very moving moment weizsaecker said 
burton levinson the league chairman called weizsaecker the 
conscience of his country who looks truth straight in the 
eye 
the antidefamation league is based in new york and known for 
its work to prevent antisemitism 
in an interview levinson and the leagues national director 
abraham foxman praised west germanys rise as a democratic nation 
that eschews political extremism 
they acknowledged that ultrarightism has increased in west 
germany but said they are confident of officials efforts to 
control it 
they have taken it seriously they are facing the problem 
they are dealing with it and we are satisfied foxman told the 
associated press 
but foxman said he is worried about what might happen among east 
germans after 40 years of communist domination if the germanys are 
reunited 
there is a concern that generations that have grown up in 
totalitarianism can very easily swing from one extreme to 
another said foxman 
they may be more supportive of a rightwing ideology which is 
nationalistic simplistic he said 
he suggested that east germans should be reeducated their 
communist leaders long maintained they did not have to accept 
responsibility for the nazi years because their country was created 
after the nazis defeat 
foxman said he would like to see reeducation occur before the 
two german states draw together in any formal way there needs to 
be a reexamination of history and an acceptance of some of the 
responsiblity he said 
chancellor helmut kohl last week unveiled a 10point plan to 
move toward uniting the germanys 
foxman said he would like his suggestion of reeducating east 
germans to be the 11th point of the plan 
the joseph prizes previous recipients include former israeli 
leaders golda meir and menachem begin author elie wiesel and 
former vice president hubert humphrey

hundreds of foreigners fled intense 
fighting between rebel and loyalist troops in a financial district 
today but thousands more were trapped for a fourth night when the 
battle halted evacuation efforts 
a rebel source said the insurgents who are seeking to oust 
president corazon aquino might refuse to allow all the americans 
to leave more than 200 americans were believed to be trapped 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
insurgents would release all asian and european tourists but the 
intention is not to release americans because of us support for 
mrs aquino 
fighting spilled over into exclusive neighborhoods near where 
the ambassadors of the united states china and the soviet union 
live us officials said ambassador nicholas platt would not be 
spending the night in his residence 
in washington today the us administration expressed concern 
for the safety of american tourists and businessmen unable to leave 
the philippines and said there remains some uncertainty about 
their status 
president bush is keeping options open as he weighs the best way 
to protect american citizens white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
you can be assured that the pentagon has contingency plans for 
everything fitzwater said while declining to elaborate on what 
additional military steps the united states might take 
the strain of captivity fear of violence and the uncertainty 
began to take their toll on the americans held 
its very frustrating with the government and with the 
reformists rebels allan campbell 61 of lancaster pa told 
reporters allowed to enter the intercontinental hotel briefly 
were getting angry now at both sides 
on friday the first day of the coup attempt us f4 phantom 
fighter jets flew air cover in support of progovernment forces 
battling guerrillas who were staging their sixth attempt to oust 
mrs aquino since she was swept to power in 1986 
more than 74 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded 
since rebels launched the bloodiest attempt yet to topple mrs 
aquinos administration rebels say the elected government has 
failed to deal effectively with the countrys communist insurgency 
corruption incompetence and economic problems 
at least two people were killed and 15 wounded in todays 
fighting one of the dead a 6yearold girl killed when a 60mm 
mortar fired by the rebels slammed into a squatter settlement near 
the makati medical center 
in addition to the 400 or so rebels entrenched in the makati 
financial district a similar number still occupied mactan air base 
in cebu 350 miles south of manila despite an ultimatum to leave 
the garrison by today 
tourism officials today prepared about 20 buses to go into 
makati to evacuate tourists to the airport but heavy fighting 
forced them to halt the convoy 
after hours of negotiations with the rebels members of the 
elite 1st scout ranger regiment government negotiators said the 
evacuation would be delayed for at least a day 
theyve decided to postpone it for tomorrow because its 
nightfall and we dont want the tourists to be mistaken for 
soldiers said rafael alunan undersecretary of tourism 
the insurgents on saturday moved into the district that is home 
to many foreign diplomats and journalists taking control of about 
22 buildings 
the us embassy and others urged their nationals to flee 
makati even if they lived in areas not yet touched by the fighting 
scores of americans arrived today at the us seafront housing 
compound which was guarded by us marines others moved to hotels 
near manila bay about five miles west of the fighting 
the philippine plaza said 450 foreigners had checked into the 
hotel by midafternoon 
were telling americans that if they can get out safely get 
out said us embassy spokesman jerry huchel but if they 
cant stay where you are but keep away from upper floors 
huchel estimated that about 215 americans were trapped in three 
luxury hotels in makati the manila chronicle quoted military 
reports as saying nine american servicemen from usrun clark air 
base 50 miles north of manila were among them 
a statement distributed to news organizations in the name of 
cashiered lt col gregorio gringo honasan a fugitive said 
the rebels did not want to hurt civilians 
we would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for the 
good of all the filipino people for the longer term the 
statement said we cannot continue with the present system in 
which the political economic and moral fiber of this country is 
slowly and shamelessly rent apart by the aquino regime under the 
shameless support of the us imperialists in the guise of 
democracy 
mutineers on friday took over several military facilities and 
bombed the presidential palace with the us air support 
government forces counterattacked and regained most positions 
honasan once supported mrs aquino but led an august 1987

bestselling author wp 
kinsella dismisses critics taking potshots at his latest hits 
because he either isnt who he writes about or hasnt been where he 
sets his stories 
fiction writers can write about anything they damn well 
please says kinsella whose collection of humorous short 
stories the miss hobbema pageant is riding high on bestseller 
lists in british columbia 
kinsella author of the baseball novel shoeless joe on which 
the recent movie field of dreams was based has come under fire 
for his short stories about indians silas ermineskin and frank 
fencepost 
marilyn buffalo mcdonald a resident of hobbema alberta who 
reviewed the miss hobbema pageant called it malicious and 
racist and sexist 
kinsella says people from hobbema tend not to be able to 
distinguish fantasy from reality 
obviously everything i write is fiction because ive never 
been there and i dont know anything about the place said 
kinsella 
that sort of thinking would mean a white male writer couldnt 
write about anything except other white males and a woman couldnt 
write about anything except women 
consequently all childrens literature would have to be 
written by children kinsella said

a significant increase in nicaraguan troop 
concentrations near the honduran border camps of the contra rebels 
is raising the possibility of a sandinista attempt at a knockout 
blow against the insurgents officials say 
at the same time the officials said intelligence reports 
indicate the sandinistas in two weeks will receive from the soviet 
union four helicopters with potential for military use 
the shipment reportedly left the soviet union by ship on the eve 
of the mediterranean summit last weekend 
in managua the nicaraguan defense ministry declined comment on 
the report 
the sources said the sandinista mobilization began to occur in 
late october when president daniel ortega called off a ceasefire 
in effect for the preceding 19 months 
there are no reliable estimates of the number of sandinistas 
involved in the redeployment 
the sandinista army is believed to be in a position to launch an 
offensive against the honduranbased camps within 72 hours 
alternatively those forces could be earmarked for use against the 
estimated 5000 contras still inside nicaragua said the officials 
insisting on anonymity 
the new deployments reflect what has been a deteriorating peace 
process in nicaragua marked not only by the suspension of the 
ceasefire five weeks ago but also by the continued existence of 
the contras despite calls by central american presidents for them 
to demobilize 
today was to have been the deadline for the contras to disband 
under a resolution approved in august by ortega and four other 
central american presidents but thousands of contras continue to 
be deployed at the honduran camps subsisting on us food and 
other nonlethal aid 
despite sandinista protests the aid will continue until after 
national elections set for feb 25 us officials are worried the 
election will be called off but the sandinistas deny any such 
intention 
the rebels note the five presidents specified the demobilization 
was to have been carried out voluntarily and they insist their 
return to their homeland cannot precede the establishment of 
democratic conditions in nicaragua 
those conditions have not been met the rebels contend 
defending their decision to ignore todays deadline 
mistrust between the sandinistas and the contras has accelerated 
in recent weeks partly because of an abortive attempt by the two 
sides last month to restore the ceasefire 
wary of sandinista intentions contra forces have been placed on 
alert and have positioned themselves further east where their 
detection by enemy forces amid dense foliage is more difficult the 
sources said 
the soviet mi17 helicopters left port last week on the eve of 
the summit and are due at the nicaraguan port of corinto on dec 
18 the officials said 
such helicopters normally are sent to nicaragua without weapons 
enabling the soviets to say they are not prolonging the conflict in 
that country on sunday after the mediterranean summit president 
mikhail gorbachev reaffirmed that his country has long since ceased 
the delivery of arms to the sandinistas 
president bush has said he does not challenge gorbachevs 
assertion but the reported shipment of mi17s appears to some 
officials to undercut the soviet leaders claims of peaceful 
involvement 
the officials said mi17s delivered to the sandinistas routinely 
are converted to military use once they arrive in nicaragua they 
are used both as troop transports and as gunships 
the sources said the sandinistas have about 38 mi17s in their 
inventory the mi17 is an advanced version of the mi8 hip 
helicopter and is more easily adaptable than the mi8 for use as a 
gunship

atlanta was jailed overnight in october for failing to appear in 
court on the overduebook charges she said she returned the books 
in 1988 and was never served with the notice to appear in court 
that seems like a reasonable amount for being dragged out of 
your house at 1030 pm and spending a night in jail without 
bond said herbert p schlanger ms lindsays attorney 
the us district court complaint alleges false arrest 
schlanger said that because ms lindsay never received court 
notice she committed no crime and therefore was falsely 
imprisoned 
solicitor gerald n blaney named in the lawsuit declined 
comment but has acknowledged that the woman didnt receive the 
notice 
ms lindsay is to appear thursday night on the tonight show 
starring johnny carson to talk about her experience

some adjustments had to be made when 
9yearold ben williamson entered pensacola high schools 
international baccalaureate honors program after skipping four 
elementary grades 
his books were too heavy for the 4foot 6inch freshman to 
carry by himself so the school issued him a second set to keep at 
home 
ben is allowed to eat lunch in the honors program office because 
he is afraid of some of his larger schoolmates and prefers playing 
checkers there with another student or chess with a retired math 
professor 
although not totally comfortable either with children his own 
age or teenagers ben prefers the company of other high school 
students 
i feel more alien when im with my age group he said we 
dont think about the same things transformers and gobots bore 
me 
although a fight against boredom propelled ben from kindergarten 
to ninth grade in four years he is still very much a child said 
donna dunson coordinator of the honors program 
we were reading lord of the flies together last year and 
discussing its parallels to russian history when all of a sudden 
his tongues out touching his nose and he says can you do this

fighting by rebels intensified 
tuesday in the embattled financial district where 2000 foreigners 
are trapped and a rebel officer said americans stranded there may 
not be freed because of us support for the aquino government 
about 215 americans are believed pinned down in hotels in the 
makati district said us embassy spokesman jerry huchel 
safe passage for the trapped foreigners was delayed tuesday 
although hundreds of others living in the district were able to 
flee to safer areas amid the most serious coup attempt so far 
against president corazon aquino who took office in february 1986 
scores of americans arrived tuesday at the us seafront housing 
compound where us marines were on guard others moved to hotels 
near manila bay about five miles west of the fighting 
at least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded 
since rebel soldiers launched the coup attempt friday 
vice president salvador laurel suggested that he mrs aquino 
and congress all resign as a means of ending the battle and 
schedule new elections 
reports said the leader of the main proaquino party had 
suggested she dismiss her cabinet as a gesture to the rebels 
rafael alunan undersecretary of tourism negotiated for hours 
with the leader of rebels in makati about the foreigners trapped in 
three luxury hotels and condominiums 
the talks at the intercontinental hotel ended at sunset and 
alunan said they would continue wednesday the rebels offered 
monday to let the foreigners leave 
after the negotiations tuesday alunan said theyve decided 
to postpone because its nightfall and we dont want the 
tourists to be mistaken for soldiers he said some details 
remained to be settled but would not be more specific 
capt albert yen one of the insurgents said the intention is 
not to release americans 
us meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our 
assault so we hold them liable yen said it is the 
responsibility of the us government if we take their nationals 
hostage 
on friday us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist 
forces without firing on the rebels and prevented insurgents from 
continuing air strikes from villamor air base they had seized the 
base in the first hours of the coup 
yen said the rebellion was codenamed seven days and seven 
nights in december and would involve a sevenstage operation he 
said the takeover of the financial district which began saturday 
was the second stage 
in washington the bush administration expressed concern for the 
trapped americans and said some uncertainty remained about 
their status 
you can be assured that the pentagon has contingency plans for 
everything white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he would 
not say what additional military steps the united states might take 
in addition to the 400 scout rangers in makati a similar number 
of mutineers still occupied the mactan air base in cebu 350 miles 
south of manila 
brig gen jose commendador leader of the mactan rebels said 
tuesday there would be a nationwide uprising by the military if 
the government moved against them 
the coast guard arrested five mutineers on a vessel that arrived 
tuesday from bacolod 300 miles south of manila

reports that rebel reinforcements were coming maj gen alfredo 
lim the manila police chief issued shoot to kill orders for 
mutineers who tried to enter the city in civilian clothes

mrs aquino in 1987 and has formed an opposition party 
gov roberto pagdanganan of bulacan province said sen neptali 
gonzalez chairman of the proaquino struggle of the democratic 
filipino party suggested in a meeting monday with the president

at least two people were killed and 15 wounded in fighting 
tuesday including a 6yearold girl killed when a 60mm mortar

the federal government is trying to turn family 
planning clinics into venues for antiabortion advocacy 
massachusetts attorney general argued tuesday in appealing a ban 
on abortion service referrals for clinics receiving government 
funds 
in 1988 the us department of health and human services barred 
family planning clinics from suggesting abortion as an option to 
pregnancy it specifically prohibits use of federal money for 
programs that assist women in obtaining abortions it also bans the 
use of funding for activities that encourage promote or advocate 
abortion 
the regulation is on hold while massachusetts new york and 
colorado wage court battles against it claiming it violates 
constitutional rights of privacy and free speech 
these regulations suppress one viewpoint but foist on patients 
another viewpoint that she should carry that pregnancy to term 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon argued tuesday before 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals what were talking about 
here is government manipulating information 
he presented a scenario in which poor uneducated pregnant 
women leave a family planning clinic believing they must continue 
their pregnancy with no alternative 
the government doesnt have to subsidize a constitutional 
right to abortion but it cant interfere with these rights 
shannon said 
arguments tuesday invoked both the 1973 supreme court decision 
in roe vs wade that abortion is a womans right to decide and the 
socalled webster case in july that said a state can deny funding 
for abortions 
justice department counsel alfred mollin arguing for health and 
human services said webster established it is wrong for the 
government to place an obstacle but not wrong to leave an obstacle 
there 
mollin contended that the regulations are not as prohibitive as 
they seem 
they dont prevent a clinic staff from at least saying they 
dont make abortion referrals he said he also said a physician 
can still refer a woman for an abortion if the pregnancy risks her 
life or health 
the tone of the regulations are not to set up an antiabortion 
advocacy group mollin said 
the matter has already been before the court in boston in may 
three judges of the 1st circuit ruled in favor of the state 
upholding an injunction blocking the ban on referrals from taking 
effect 
but when the supreme court handed down the webster decision two 
months later the federal government asked the 1st circuit to 
rehear the arguments in this new light 
elsewhere the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york 
city upheld the regulations last month 
a ruling is pending on an appeal of the regulations in federal 
court in denver on behalf of planned parenthood affiliates 
this fiscal year the federal government is spending 138 
million to provide family planning services to 5 million teenagers 
and women 
this case is the only one that is national in scope said 
scott swirling executive director of the national family planning 
and reproductive health association based in washington dc the 
outcome will determine whether poor women can get complete amounts 
of information about abortion 
this case doesnt concern the legality of abortion but until 
and unless the supreme court overturns roe v wade abortion is a 
legal and constitutional right

despite a report that national drug policy 
director william j bennett and budget director richard darman are 
at loggerheads over the 1991 budget to fight illegal drugs a 
bennett spokesman said tuesday that he expects a happy ending 
when the shouting is over 
an administration source said monday that bennett and darman 
are apart by more than a couple of hundred million dollars it may 
end up going to the president to get things sorted out 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity refused to 
detail the proposals from bennett or darman but did say he expects 
to see a real increase over the 88 billion 1991 budget 
under the antidrug abuse act of 1988 which created bennetts 
office of national drug control policy bennett is required to 
certify that the antidrug budget sent to capitol hill is adequate 
to fund the strategy he has developed to curb drug use 
after president bush presented the original strategy sept 5 
along with a 79 billion price tag for 1990 members of congress 
questioned bennett on whether he had set the budget figure or 
whether that figure had been imposed by darmans office of 
management and budget bennett told congress which eventually 
increased the 1990 budget to 88 billion that he felt the 79 
billion was adequate 
asked if bennett would be able to give congress the same 
assurances on the 1991 budget if he doesnt win the battle with 
darman bennett spokesman don hamilton said tuesday im not 
really very worried about it im confident its all going to have 
a happy ending 
the agencies come up with the numbers hamilton said 
bennett takes a look at them the idea is that we work this 
through keeping omb in what should be a threecornered thing 
hamilton had said monday this is the time of year when lots 
of agency heads and cabinet secretaries are talking to darman 
occasionally in strong terms 
omb spokeswoman barbara clay said only we have nothing to 
say we dont comment at all on the 91 budget and this falls into 
that category 
meanwhile bennetts office is continuing to work on the update 
of the national drug control strategy referred to among officials 
as strategy two like the original strategy the update is 
required by congress 
the update is expected to include designations of cities or 
regions considered highintensity drugtrafficking areas that 
would be eligible for additional federal resources both money and 
personnel 
published reports have said the areas to be so designated in the 
upcoming strategy are los angeles new york miami houston and the 
southwest border officials in bennetts office say no final 
decisions have been made 
the conversations in reference to highintensity drug 
trafficking areas are still ongoing said reggie walton 
associate director for state and local affairs it is incorrect 
to say any final resolutions have been made 
although numerous cities have clamored for the designation in 
the hope of a windfall of federal aid there is relatively little 
money available for 1990 only 25 million is in the federal 
budget and that could be enhanced by up to 21 million from the 
federal asset forfeiture fund walton said that fund contains 
revenue from assets seized from drug traffickers including cash 
bank accounts homes cars planes and boats among other things 
but one administration official said were looking at 
dividing this money up among four five six seven areas what can 
you do with this money the official said the los angeles area 
spends 2 billion of its own money for antidrug efforts 
in comparison bennett has said the federal effort to crack down 
on drugs in the nations capital alone will cost about 97 million 
including money for three drug treatment centers and a new jail for 
the district of columbia 
walton said the highintensity drugtrafficking areas might get 
federal resources such as personnel instead of cash he declined to 
say how much money would be sought for the areas in 1991

in this season of conspicuous 
consumption gourmets and gluttons alike can load up at a grocery 
store that offers patrons the use of brass carts and cellular 
telephones and plays live classical music 
customers at fjs blackhawk market a yearold 
33000squarefoot store also can sip on freshbrewed french roast 
coffee served from gleaming brass urns while they shop 
theres no muzak here shoppers stroll down 
blackandwhitetiled softly lit aisles to strains of classical 
music played by a tuxedoed musician at the keyboard of a shiny 
black grand piano 
fjs operations manager greg pereira likes to watch new 
customers do doubletakes as they enter the store he says it 
borrows a little from other luxury markets while adding his own 
whimsical spin 
the son of a grocery store owner pereira owned several chain 
markets before embarking on the upscale showplace about 30 miles 
east of san francisco near the exclusive blackhawk country club 
home to numerous bay area sports stars executives and 
personalities 
fjs was the first store to start up at a shopping complex in 
the foothills of majestic mount diablo amid a burgeoning suburban 
population with a median household income of 90000 and an average 
age of 38 
he and store owner frank j straface teamed up to create their 
own blackhawk version of beyerlys in minnesota simon davids in 
dallas ajs in scottsdale ariz and harrods in london 
we were laughed at we were ridiculed by the industry we 
didnt know if we couldnt do it pereira recalled 
but they went ahead doing away with the traditional fluorescent 
lights that shine overhead in other supermarkets and installing 
black cases and shelves for eyecatching displays of all products 
but produce and meat state laws ban black shelves for those two 
items 
shoppers focusing on food can find the usual peanut butter 
salami chips breakfast flakes and cat food but its the unusual 
that sets fjs apart from the usual mall market 
fjs boasts almost 70 kinds of mustard ranging in price from 70 
cents to 10 there is maple syrup from vermont cranberry cabernet 
chutney wild mushroom caviar squid ink pasta and bags of 
grapevine cuttings to impart an unusual flavor to california 
barbeques 
what do i like about fjs said shopper pat devine of 
blackhawk everything the people are friendly the place is 
clean the carts work 
so do the cellular phones you can check out while shopping 
local calls are free longdistance calls can be charged to 
customer credit cards periera said the idea was more novel than 
practical at first and callers tended to boast to friends 
youll never guess where im calling from 
but he said the dozen phones are more often used now to check 
with someone at home about food purchases although they have been 
used to complete a car purchase and conclude stock deals 
capitalizing on the communications boon fjs also accepts orders 
via fax machines 
everything is done in the spirit of fun said pereira such as 
an event dubbed dog days of summer during that promotion the 
store offered samples of a frozen canine treat called frosty 
paws along with fjs own version of thirsty pup bottled 
spring water 
the extras dont jack up the cost of the inventory pereira 
said the fixtures and the shopping carts cost fjs the same as they 
would other stores but fjs tailors them to the upscale market 
for instance they buy fewer carts that look nicer he said 
it doesnt cost anything pereira said there is no price 
value to it its just a different approach 
focusing on speciality items does bring the store more profit 
he acknowledged 
for example he noted that most stores dont carry nine 
varieties of caviar or carry champagne that ranges in price from 
3 to 1000 a bottle ten percent profit on a 1000 bottle is 
much more than on a 3 bottle of the bubbly he added

states should be barred from outlawing the 
mere possession and simple viewing of child pornography the 
supreme court was told tuesday 
anything that one uses in ones own home its all protected 
under the first amendment public defender s adele shank argued 
in attacking such an ohio law 
but columbus city attorney ronald j obrien said possession of 
lewd depictions of nude children is not an act falling under the 
first amendments freedomofexpression protections 
child pornography has been driven underground obrien said 
because its underground the additional tool of having a 
possession offense is necessary 
the nations highest court ruled in 1982 that states may outlaw 
material depicting sexual performances by children because such 
material like obscenity is not constitutionally protected 
but the 1982 decision dealt with producing and selling child 
pornography not the private possession of it 
clyde osborne of columbus then 61 was prosecuted in 1985 for 
possessing four photos of a nude boy believed to be 13 or 14 
prosecutors said osborne got the photos from a florida mailorder 
business and had placed them in a photo album in his home 
the photos were discovered after police searched osbornes home 
on a tip that he had bought the material 
osborne was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail 
the state law as passed by the ohio legislature banned 
possession or viewing of any material or performance that shows a 
minor in a state of nudity exemptions were included for 
parents and among other things for photos with an artistic 
medical or scientific purpose 
the ohio supreme court in upholding the law narrowed its ban 
to lewd depictions of nude children under 18 
many of the justices questions tuesday centered on whether the 
law as originally worded or the law as construed by ohios highest 
court is now at issue 
ms shank representing osborne said the court must confine its 
ruling to the law as originally written obrien said the law as 
construed by the ohio supreme court is what is before the court 
whichever rendition of the state law the justices use their 
decision is expected by july 
some of their questions and comments focused directly on the 
validity of outlawing something possessed in ones home 
when ms shank noted that the high court in 1969 ruled that 
governments may not ban the private possession of obscene 
materials chief justice william h rehnquist reminded her of the 
courts 1982 childporn decision and other rulings 
a lot of water has flowed uner the bridge since the 1969 
ruling rehnquist said 
justice antonin scalia at one point said ohio asserts the only 
way to dry up the childpornography business is by making it 
illegal to have this material the same way you attempt to dry 
up elephant poaching by making it illegal to possess ivory 
ms shank and obrien disagreed over how many other states have 
similar laws 
obrien told the justices that 18 other states have similar 
laws briefs previously submitted identified those states as 
alabama arizona colorado florida georgia idaho illinois 
kansas minnesota missouri nebraska nevada oklahoma south 
dakota texas utah washington and west virginia 
but ms shank said not one of those states outlaws the 
viewing of child pornography 
there is not a single statute that replicates the ohio 
statute she said ours is the broadest such statute in the 
country 
the case is osborne vs ohio 885986

cities and other local governments may be 
forced to pay civil rights damages if they interfere illegally in 
labor negotiations the supreme court ruled tuesday 
by a 63 vote the justices said los angeles city officials are 
required to compensate a taxi company that went out of business 
when the city canceled its franchise during a dispute between the 
company and its drivers 
the ruling while relatively narrow bucks a recent high court 
trend limiting the application of federal civil rights laws 
the decision does not affect state governments the court ruled 
last june that states and state officials may not be sued under the 
civil rights law used in the los angeles case 
in other action the court 
made it easier in a unanimous ruling in an ohio case for 
workers to sue their unions over alleged failures to provide fair 
representation 
ruled 81 in a new york city case that federal judges may 
punish lawyers but not their law firms for frivolous lawsuits and 
needless legal maneuvers 
heard arguments in an ohio case over the power of states to 
outlaw mere possession of material containing lewd depictions of 
child nudity 
in the cab company case the los angeles city council refused in 
1981 to renew the golden state transit corps taxi franchise 
because the company was caught up in a dispute with a teamsters 
union local representing company drivers 
golden state with 400 cabs had been the citys largest taxi 
operator until 1980 the teamsters called a strike for the same day 
the city was to consider renewing the franchises of 13 cab 
companies 
golden state went out of business after failing to win renewal 
of its franchise 
the supreme court ruled in 1986 that los angeles officials 
improperly interfered with rights protected by the national labor 
relations act 
that ruling said local governments lack authority to tip the 
balance in labor disputes by defining what economic sanctions 
either side might suffer 
but the decision did not specify what remedy was available to 
golden state 
the case went back to the lower federal courts and last year 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals denied compensatory damages 
to the defunct taxi company 
a federal judge previously ordered los angeles officials to 
grant golden state a fouryear franchise and pay the market value 
of the companys assets less what it received in bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the company said that was a hollow victory since it already had 
liquidated its assets when it went out of business 
the supreme court on tuesday permitted the cab company to sue 
the city under a federal civil rights law enacted after the civil 
war that generally benefits individuals rather than businesses 
justice john paul stevens said while the national labor 
relations act does not authorize such suits the act creates 
rights in labor and management that are protected against 
governmental interference 
therefore he said either side in a labormanagement dispute 
that is victimized by government interference may invoke the 
federal civil rights law to seek compensation 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy and sandra day oconnor dissented

prime minister margaret thatcher won a handsome 
but lessthancrushing victory tuesday against an unprecedented 
challenge to her leadership of the conservative party 
she won 314 out of the 374 votes by tory members of parliament 
while 33 supported challenger sir anthony meyer 24 abstained and 
three didnt vote 
even though 60 of her fellow tories did not vote for her mrs 
thatcher declared that the result with backing from 85 percent of 
the parliamentary party showed overwhelming support 
id like to say how very pleased i am to have had the 
overwhelming support of my colleagues in the house and of the 
people from the party in the country she said outside her no 10 
downing st residence tuesday night 
ordinarily the result would have been regarded as an 
unassailable vote of confidence but in mrs thatchers case it 
provoked conflicting assessments 
the 64yearold prime minister has been reelected unopposed 
every year since becoming conservative leader in 1975 and has 
stamped her style and authority on the party to such an extent that 
any rebellion becomes a major event 
the consensus among analysts had been that anything under 45 not 
supporting her would be a crushing victory while 100 or more would 
be a devastating blow 
i think she was bruised rather than fatally wounded said 
eleanor goodman political correspondent of independent television 
news 
i think it is a troublesome result for her said john cole 
bbctvs political editor broadcasting the result live to the 
nation from the house of commons 
anything below 50 nonsupporters would have been an absolute 
triumph i think 57 is a bloody good result said norman tebbit 
a thatcher ally and former party chairman he did not count the 
three who did not vote 
meyer 69 a littleknown outsider put up his candidacy to 
rally opposition to mrs thatchers handling of the economy her 
tough style of leadership and her reluctance to integrate britain 
deeper into the european economic community 
he had said he was hoping his move would tempt more serious 
contenders to declare their candidacy but no one including the 
leading undeclared candidate former defense secretary michael 
heseltine joined the contest 
meyer conceded that the prime minister already 10 years in 
office was entitled to feel pretty pleased with the result 
but the outcome was expected to keep speculation alive about a 
more closely run contest next year if the economy does not improve 
and mrs thatchers poll showings slump 
thatcher government policies are blamed for an annual inflation 
rate of 73 percent a falling pound and 15percent interest rates 
mrs thatcher was having her weekly meeting with queen elizabeth 
ii when the last ballots were counted in a committee room at the 
house of commons and the result was announced 
her campaign manager george younger said the result was 
conveyed to her at buckingham palace immediately

she is in her third term as prime minister following tory 
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections she is the 
longest serving prime minister this century 
meyer a former diplomat told britains sky television before 
the vote she is sticking very grimly to the defense of every 
shred of british nationalism and refusing to consider any further 
pooling of sovereignty such as would be necessary to enable the 
12nation european community to proceed successfully forward 
she seems to spend half her time poisoning the publics mind 
against the european community 
he added if you listen to almost any group of members of 
parliament talking privately one thing they are all agreed on is 
that the prime ministers style has become intolerably bossy that 
she doesnt listen to any of her cabinet ministers she treats them 
like errand boys there is a narrowness an intolerance about 
her

red army faction terrorists who 
killed west german financier alfred herrhausen last week declared 
in a letter delivered tuesday that no one is safe from their 
assaults 
they also demanded that their jailed comrades be housed together 
the letter dated saturday and stamped with the groups 
signature symbol a star and machine gun was received by a western 
news agency in bonn it described herrhausen chairman of the 
deutsche bank as europes most powerful economic figure and said 
he had been executed for that reason 
herrhausens plan for resolving the third world debt crisis was 
nothing other than an attempt to ensure longterm domination and 
plundering said the letter sent by mail with false return 
address 
there is no place in the world for the leaders of this system 
and there can be no protection against the attacks of revolutionary 
guerrilla units it said 
spokesmen for the federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said 
they viewed the letter as an authentic claim of responsibility from 
the red army faction which had been dormant for three years until 
the herrhausen assassination 
his armored mercedes was blown up by a remotecontrol bomb in 
bad homburg where he lived as he was being driven to work nov 30 
authorities searched about 150 apartments monday night in 
darmstadt acting on information from more than 1000 reports and 
tips relayed to the federal crime bureau in wiesbaden said bureau 
spokesman willy terstiege 
he said no useful evidence was found 
agents obtained search warrants for an entire apartment building 
after receiving reports that the bombers might be hiding there he 
terstiege said 
an organization in hamburg called the prisoners information 
bureau which speaks for jailed red army faction terrorists said 
the cells of 26 had been searched in the past week in connection 
with the herrhausen case

federal judges may punish lawyers but not 
their law firms for frivolous lawsuits and needless legal 
maneuvers the supreme court ruled today 
voting 81 to overturn a 50000 penalty against a nowdissolved 
new york city law firm the justices said a federal court rule is 
aimed only at the lawyers who sign the offending documents the 
rule does not apply to those lawyers law firms the court said 
the rule at issue says courts may deal with an offending 
document by imposing on the person who signed it an 
appropriate sanction 
writing for the court justice antonin scalia said just as 
the requirement of signature is imposed upon the individual we 
think the recited import and consequences of signature run as to 
him 
the federal rule requires litigating lawyers to inquire before 
attaching the required signature to any filing whether it has merit 
scalia said where the text establishes a duty that cannot be 
delegated one may reasonably expect it to authorize punishment 
only of the party upon whom the duty is placed 
justice thurgood marshall was the sole dissenter calling 
todays decison an unnecessary erosion of the discretion of 
federal trial judges 
in other action the court 
made it easier for workers to sue their unions over alleged 
failures to offer fair representation 
the court unanimously reinstated a federal lawsuit a toledo 
ohio area sheet metal worker filed against his union five years 
ago 
lower courts had thrown out the suit ruling the plaintiff was 
alleging an unfair labor practice and that the national labor 
relations board has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims the 
justices said those courts were wrong 
ruled that cities and other local governments that interfere 
illegally in labor negotiations may be forced to pay damages for 
losses suffered by management or workers 
the court ruled 63 that los angeles officials are required to 
compensate a taxi company that went out of business after the city 
interfered in a dispute between the company and its driver 
the lawyersanctions case stemmed from a 1982 lawsuit filed by 
northern j calloway an actor who plays the character david on 
televisions sesame street 
calloway sued marvel entertainment group and others accusing 
them of copyright infringement and other violations on a proposed 
animated science fiction movie to be called the skyrider 
his suit sought 44 million in damages 
a federal judge dismissed the suit and imposed 100000 in 
sanctions against calloway 50000 against his lawyer ray 
leflore and 50000 against the former law firm of pavelic and 
leflore 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the penalties 
against leflore and the law firm stating calloways case was at 
all times very weak from the very beginning his case suffered 
from obvious and grave weaknesses 
for example the appeals court said none of the people sued 
made any money from the proposed movie project 
todays decision reversed the 2nd circuit courts ruling 
regarding the law firms sanction 
leflore did not ask the high court to overturn the 50000 
penalty assessed against him personally 
the case is pavelic amp leflore vs marvel entertainment 88791

all children entering school should be ready 
to learn the head of the nations largest teachers union said 
tuesday in proposing federally financed preschool programs for 
poor youngsters that integrate nutrition prenatal care and health 
screening 
no child should be allowed to fall through the cracks said 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
every child should arrive at school physically intellectually 
emotionally and socially able to learn 
geiger said the nea will offer ideas on what the nations 
education goals should be during a thursday meeting of the 
education task force of the national governors association 
the task force has been working on a set of national performance 
goals for education since the idea was approved in september at the 
education summit called by president bush and attended by the 
nations governors all 50 governors are to convene in late 
february to put on the finishing touches 
in a dec 1 letter to the task force cochairmen geiger 
suggested the goals be both ambitious and specific ambitious 
enough to demonstrate that americas leaders understand the depth 
of the problems schools face specific enough to enable americans 
to hold government accountable 
geiger said improving preschool education should be the primary 
focus of reform efforts he said programs designed to provide 
prenatal care nutritional support health screening and 
developmental child care must be made available to all families of 
young children in need 
head start has been touted as the most successful preschool 
program financed by the federal government about 1300 head start 
programs operate around the country providing education health 
and nutrition services to about 20 percent of the improverished 
preschoolers who are eligible 
president bush recently signed a law to increase spending for 
the head start program this fiscal year by 147 million to 16 
billion 
the nea estimated that about 63 billion is needed to serve all 
eligible children aged 3 through 5 
other proposals the nea wants incorporated into the national 
performance goals are ones to 
provide a fully qualified teacher for every classroom salaries 
and benefits should be competitive with other fields that require 
comparable skills preparation and responsibility 
end school financing patterns that make the quality of 
education dependent on the wealth of the local school district 
provide teachers with tools other professionals take for 
granted a telephone adequate work space a personal computer and 
access to clerical support 
focus learning on critical thinking and encourage teachers 
employees parents and communities to become involved in decisions 
that affect the schools 
reduce the dropout rate to less than 10 percent 
make grants and affordable loans available to all high school 
graduates in economic need so they are guaranteed access to higher 
education or postsecondary training

israeli soldiers tuesday killed five heavily 
armed arab guerrillas who crossed the border from egypt and planned 
a spectacular terrorist attack to mark the anniversary of the 
palestinian uprising the army said 
israeli jets staged their second raid into lebanon in the past 
12 days in an attempt to forestall further infiltrations coinciding 
with the uprisings second anniversary on friday lebanese police 
said seven people were wounded 
in the occupied gaza strip a palestinian teenager was killed 
and 20 palestinians were wounded in stonethrowing clashes with 
troops arab doctors said 
the death raised to 626 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli gunfire during the uprising against israels occupation of 
the west bank and gaza fortythree israelis have died since the 
intefadeh as the revolt is called began on dec 8 1987 
the clash in the negev desert occurred before dawn when an 
israeli force encountered the five guerrillas and gave chase the 
soldiers killed all the guerrillas in the hilly area of mount harif 
and suffered no casualties themselves the army said 
maj gen matan vilnai head of the armys southern command 
said the infiltration was apparently linked to the uprising 
anniversary 
we can assume there is a link between these things there 
is no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carry 
out such an attack he said on armed forces radio 
the guerrillas carried sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault 
rifles 51 hand grenades a pistol with magazines binoculars and 
wire cutters and were on their way to a spectacular attack in 
israel the army said 
vilnai said the guerrillas equipment shows they simply meant 
to kill not to argue too much not to carry out a hostagetaking 
operation but a killing operation 
they carried no documents and as a result we cannot know to 
what group they belonged he added 
it was the first infiltration in nine months from egypt the 
only arab country to have a peace treaty with israel the last 
occurred march 15 1989 when two guerrillas from a fundamentalist 
moslem group were captured near the border town of rafah 
there have been at least 50 infiltrations this year from 
lebanon israel staged its 17th raid of the year on guerrilla bases 
there tuesday 
four fighters struck the base of terrorist mastermind abu 
nidals fatah revolutionary council in the majdalioun valley east 
of sidon a lebanese police spokesman said seven people were 
reported wounded 
the israeli army said all aircraft returned safely 
on nov 25 israeli jets attacked bases of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command in lebanon 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers opened fire to disperse 
palestinian stonethrowers killing a 17yearold and wounding 20 
other demonstrators hospital officials said they said nasser 
alkejek was fatally wounded in the chest 
the army said tuesday that all schools in gaza will be closed 
starting wednesday until further notice apparently to prevent 
riots linked to the uprising anniversary 
defense minister yitzhak rabin in a speech in tel aviv devoted 
to the anniversary said that politically the palestinians this 
year are in a much weaker situation than they were a year ago 
rabin said stonethrowing in the middle east was low on the 
international agenda but noted it was bothering israel since 85 
percent of violent incidents in the territories were 
stonethrowings 
however rabin said they cannot move the bulk of palestinians 
to demonstrations no doubt violent demonstrations all the 
attempts at civil disobedience have failed completely 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories said tuesday that 132 children under the age of 17 have 
been shot and killed in the uprising including 37 under the age of 
13 
it said the number of casualties among children is increasing 
rabin and prime minister yitzhak shamir were briefed tuesday by 
assistant us secretary of state john kelly on last weekends 
summit between president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the situation in the region does not depend on the decision of 
world powers even superpowers shamir said afterward the 
situation depends on us and our neighbors and the solution will be 
found in agreement between israel and its neighbors we should not 
expect salvation from the superpowers

three suspected rightwing 
terrorists who escaped custody in namibia had been linked to south 
africanbased death squads believed to have killed two white 
activists police said tuesday 
south africas staterun television reported that police were 
investigating the possibility the escape may have been arranged by 
a farright group that had drawn up a hit list of potential 
assassination targets 
the report said five suspected members of the group had been 
arrested it did not identify the organization or give further 
details 
the escapees two south africans and a west german 
overpowered police guards monday and fled in a car with two 
accomplices near windhoek namibias territorial capital 
one of the officers ricardo van wyk was hit in the spine by a 
shot from his own revolver which was seized he was unconscious in 
a windhoek hospital tuesday and doctors said he might be paralyzed 
the escapees had been charged with murdering a black security 
guard in a hand grenade attack on a united nations office in 
northern namibia in august south african police said the three 
were connected to two former south african police officers held in 
the assassinations of david webster of johannesburg on may 1 and 
anton lubowksi of windhoek on sept 12 
police have said the exofficers also have been linked to death 
squads some of which allegedly existed in the national police 
force 
webster was a university lecturer and human rights advocate 
lubowski was the only white official of the southwest africa 
peoples organization the main independence movement in namibia 
the grenade attack on the un office in the town of outjo and 
the assassination of lubowski were the most publicized incidents of 
violence during the campaign for unsupervised preindependence 
elections in november 
swapo which waged a 23year guerrilla war for independence from 
south africa won a majority in an assembly that is now drafting a 
constitution independence is expected by early next year 
some rightwing whites accused the un monitoring force of 
favoring swapo in the election 
the head of the un contingent martti ahtisaari said tuesday 
it appeared that arrangements for moving the escapees between their 
cells and a courthouse were surprisingly lax 
the three had been charged with the murder of david hosaeb 22 
a private security guard at the un office 
they were identified as horst klenz 52 of west germany and 
darrell stopforth 22 and leonard veenendal 23 both south 
africans 
veenendal headed the johannesburg branch of the afrikaner 
resistance movement whose members advocate creation of a 
whitesonly state and often wear khaki uniforms with swastikastyle 
emblems 
one of the expolicemen held in the killing of the white 
activists is ferdinand barnard a former detective convicted in 
1984 of murdering two drug suspects the other is calla botha a 
wellknown rugby player who was a member of the brixton murder and 
robbery squad the unit investigating the assassinations 
on monday law and order minister adriaan vlok said police had 
made progress in their investigation of south african death squads 
believed involved in the slayings 
the national police force has been criticized widely for its 
failure to solve dozens of killings of antigovernment activists 
since 1978 opposition groups have demanded the appointment of an 
independent judicial commission to conduct the investigations

the united states does not plan to protest the 
detention of us military observers by soviet officers in east 
germany last week an incident the pentagon revealed tuesday to 
have been the fifth of its kind in the past year 
five soviet military observer teams were detained by western 
military forces in west germany over the same period said pentagon 
spokesman pete williams 
asked whether the detentions amounted to titfortat events 
williams said i am only reporting the facts 
in announcing that the pentagon had no plans to protest the 
latest incident williams said no one senses that they were 
unreasonably detained 
a us officer and noncommissioned officer were held for 7 
hours near halle about 80 miles southwest of berlin and a tire on 
their car slashed with a bayonet 
the detention took place friday on the eve of president bushs 
summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but it was not 
made public until reporters made inquiries in washington on monday 
williams adding fresh details during a briefing tuesday said 
the us soldiers were stopped in their car by a man dressed in 
civilian clothes who informed them that they were in a restricted 
zone 
the tour tried to leave but was blocked another individual 
in civilian clothing punctured the vehicles left front tire with a 
bayonet williams said then a soviet investigation officer 
arrived and indicated to the us tour officer that that was an 
overreaction the puncturing of the tire 
the spokesman said us army officials in europe found the 
soviet officer who came to investigate cordial professional and 
thorough and that the two american soldiers were found not to 
have been in a restricted area 
no us personnel were threatened they did not perceive a 
threat to their safety williams said 
the spokesman said no one was injured and the us soldiers 
returned to their base in the east germany city of potsdam near 
berlin 
williams said it appeared that the man who had slashed the tire 
was a soviet officer 
he said the americans were detained for such a long time because 
the soviet investigating officer had to come some distance and then 
conducted a very thorough investigation 
the observers are part of the us military mission that was 
established under a 1947 accord that allows the western allies and 
the soviets to set up offices in each others occupation zones 
under this pact the united states britain and france have 
military liaison offices in east germany which is the old soviet 
occupation zone and the soviets have three in west germany one in 
each of the old us british and french zones each office may have 
a staff of 14 soldiers 
asked what the two us officers were doing at the time of the 
incident friday williams said they were doing what us 
military liaison mission people do they go out and they look 
around its similar to what the soviet military mission does 
based out of frankfurt 
the detention came despite the signing in june of a ussoviet 
agreement designed to avoid dangerous military incidents reached 
between thenchairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william 
crowe and top soviet military officials 
on monday the pentagon also announced that us and soviet 
officials met in washington in august and in moscow in november to 
prepare for implementation of the safety accord the agreement is 
scheduled formally to come into force jan 1 
in march 1985 a soviet sentry shot an unarmed us army major 
arthur d nicholson jr and let him to die without medical aid 
saying nicholson had been caught redhanded taking pictures in 
a restricted area of east germany

one of czechoslovakias two 
republics named the first government in 41 years dominated by 
noncommunists and talks began with opposition leaders on their 
demands for a new national government 
leaders of the communistcontrolled labor organization took the 
unprecedented step of endorsing a general strike that the 
opposition has threatened if the national government is not changed 
this week 
an interior ministry announcement said work on dismantling 
fortifications on the border with austria would begin monday the 
government said last week some of the barbed wire watch towers and 
trip wires would be taken down 
about 2000 demonstrating students chanted resign resign 
as ladislav adamec the communist premier met with dissident 
playwright vaclav havel on demands for a new cabinet to replace the 
communistdominated one chosen sunday 
jiri dienstbier spokesman for havels opposition group civic 
forum said the discussions would continue wednesday miroslav 
pavel who is head of state television and attended the talks said 
they were very complicated 
opposition groups say the general strike will take place monday 
unless the 21member cabinet which contains only five 
noncommunists is replaced before then 
dienstbier called the new czech government a step in the right 
direction but said its composition still was not an accurate 
reflection of public opinion 
the parliamentary commission investigating the police violence 
nov 17 that started the nations peaceful revolt said tuesday 
that ousted communist party chief milos jakes and miroslav stepan 
the former prague party boss bear direct political 
responsibility for the crackdown 
it proposed that six senior police officers be fired to prevent 
them influencing the investigation 
the czech cabinet named to serve under premier frantisek pitra 
a communist includes nine noncommunists and seven members of the 
party it is the first government of any kind in czechoslovakia 
since 1948 not to be dominated by communists 
two ministers are from the socialist party and two from the 
peoples party both of which had been docile allies of the 
communists but are playing an increasingly independent role 
after the government was announced the peoples party demanded 
an immediate change to give noncommunists more power it also 
demanded the party relinquish control of the czech interior 
ministry which oversees the regional police 
in a statement the party said it wants 50 percent of cabinet 
posts given to nonparty experts with the communists and two other 
parties sharing the other half 
dienstbier said civic forum endorsed the peoples party demands 
under czechoslovakias federal system the czech and slovak 
governments have responsibility for several areas in which the 
opposition wants reforms such as education justice and culture 
communists still dominate the slovak regional government 
miroslav toman first deputy prime minister of the czech 
government defended retention by communists of the interior 
ministry and other key portfolios such as finance agriculture and 
industry by suggesting other parties did not necessarily have 
qualified candidates 
asked how soon the regional government wanted free elections a 
central demand of the opposition he said it favored very swift 
adoption of a new law 
late tuesday the regional party released the text of its 
program for economic and political reform central commitee member 
jan siroky described it as a platform for the revival of the 
communist party from the grassroots 
hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets monday to 
protest the new national cabinet which includes 16 communists and 
many holdovers from the last government they also called for free 
elections by july 
the opposition has won astounding concessions from the 
communists since protests of police suppression of peaceful 
demonstrators nov 17 led to a mass movement for democracy 
adamec agreed last week to name a new coalition government and 
relinquish the partys 41year hold on power a day later 
parliament voted to remove consitutional provisions that gave the 
party a power monopoly 
at mondays rally vaclav maly an opposition spokesman was 
cheered loudly when he said civic forum and its slovak counterpart 
public against violence would run candidates when free elections 
are held 
more cheers went up when other opposition members demanded the 
truth about the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the prague 
spring of reform in 1968 
after the national communist party reversed 21 years of policy 
friday and declared the invasion a mistake it was officially 
condemned monday by the soviet union and the four other warsaw pact 
nations who participated the statement was printed without comment 
in official czechoslovak dailies tuesday 
in a nationally televised address national party leader karel 
urbanek said he discussed the tragic events of august 1968 with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at the warsaw pact meeting 
monday in moscow 
the new party leadership fully identified itself with the 
inspirational sources of the prague spring urbanek declared he 
said the partys new action program calls for the political 
rehabilitation of those expelled from the party after the invasion

the internal revenue service is investigating 
to determine whether former president reagan and his wife nancy 
owe taxes on designer gowns she borrowed a government source said 
tuesday 
the source speaking on condition he not be identified said the 
irs was acting at least partly on the basis of information from m 
chris blazakis a freelance journalist who previously worked for 
the designer galanos 
galanos lent dresses to mrs reagan 
blazakis who is said to be writing a book about the reagans 
could not be reached he is reported to be living in new york but 
there was no answer at a manhattan telephone listed to a c 
blazakis 
a report of the irs investigation appeared in tuesdays 
washington post quoting blazakis as saying he shared detailed 
information with the irs and the agency has launched a 
comprehensive examination 
the reagans spokesman mark weinberg said from the former 
presidents office in los angeles that the reagans were out of town 
and he had not been able to ask them about the report 
wilson fadely a spokesman for the irs said by law we cant 
comment confirm or deny whether anyone is under investigation 
the reagans tax attorney roy miller of los angeles did not 
return a reporters telephone call seeking comment 
jill brett a spokeswoman for the national archives said irs 
agents visited the archives in october or november and examined a 
large number of photographs from the reagan white house with the 
reagans permission and requested copies of some 
they did not tell us what they were looking for and we did 
not ask ms brett said 
the post quoted sources as saying that the irs had questioned 
employees at galanos originals in los angeles and at us shoe 
corp headquartered in cincinnati among others 
jim crowe an attorney for us shoe said wed rather not 
get involved in it that matter really is between us and the irs 
and the irs and mrs reagan 
paul shaw galanos business manager also declined comment 
saying i dont know what happened between blazakis and mr 
galanos asked if he knew of an irs investigation he said he 
regarded the matter as confidential 
the post quoted blazakis as saying the justice department was 
also investigating the allegations department spokesman david 
runkel said i think we have been notified but are not involved 
in anything at this time 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said last year there was 
no illegality because the white house counsels office had 
determined that there were no tax consequences from the transaction 
ab culvahouse a washington attorney who was white house 
counsel at the time did not return a reporters telephone call 
david berenson chief washington tax lawyer for the law firm of 
ernst and young said the tax questions involved are very gray 
there are a lot of cases saying that any use of property 
without recompense has either gift or compensatory implications 
berenson said 
on the other hand he said its a question of whose benefit 
this is for he argued that the designers who loaned the dresses 
might be the ones who received the benefit by having their gowns 
worn by the first lady he said it also might be difficult to 
establish a fair market value 
the post said several tax experts whom it interviewed last year 
said that the dresses by galanos adolfo and other designers some 
of which were worth 20000 should be regarded as interestfree 
loans and therefore taxable income to nancy reagan 
mrs reagan has acknowledged borrowing the designer gowns during 
her years in the white house but former president reagan did not 
list them as loans on his government financial disclosure 
statements or declare their value on the couples income tax 
returns

done so brletic said butler did not answer and no further words 
were exchanged he said 
minutes later when the bus was about 100 yards from school 
butler shot ference with a 32caliber revolver then put the gun 
to his temple and fired killing himself the chief said

the soviet union sharply warned west germany at a 
meeting of their foreign ministers on tuesday that pushing for 
german reunification at this time can only bring trouble the 
soviet news agency tass reported 
it said eduard shevardnadze recalled soviet experience with a 
strong germany during world war ii in telling hansdietrich 
genscher propaganda about a federation of the two germanys can 
only exacerbate turmoil in the current circumstances 
the official news agency quoted shevardnadze as saying 
an attempt to use difficulties in the reconstruction process 
in socialist countries for onesided selfish goals without taking 
into account the longterm general european interests can threaten 
the accumulated positive developments stability and peace on the 
continent 
genscher also met tuesday with president mikhail s gorbachev to 
discuss what was once unthinkable for the soviets german 
reunification 
following the defeat of adolf hitlers nazi germany the german 
state became divided into two nations communist east germany in 
the soviet sphere and capitalistic prowestern west germany 
at the weekend summit in malta gorbachev told president bush 
that reunification gave the soviet union some problems that could 
push it too hard too fast could create some real tension 
according to secretary of state james a baker iii 
genscher told a news conference later he assured gorbachev both 
germanys will keep in mind their responsibility for the security 
of the whole of europe 
for the soviet union which says it lost 20 million people to 
the nazis in the war theoretical queries on the prospect of a 
reunited germany have long brought flat rejection 
shevardnadze told genscher the current developments touch on 
deeprooted interests of the soviet union the countries of the 
warsaw pact and finally all europeans the soviet people well 
remember history and the tragic lesson of the second world war our 
public opinion is sensitive to everything relating to its result 
no one should forget this 
gorbachev in recent weeks has tempered his previous clear 
opposition as political upheaval in east germany brought the 
question to the forefront of international discussion and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl offered a detailed process for 
possible reunification 
while objecting to any immediate call for reunification 
gorbachev has indicated a willingness to let history decide 
tass said monday that despite the acuteness of the problem 
the soviet union is prepared to discuss it in the spirit of new 
thinking presupposing respect for the stand of the other 
but according to tass shevardnadzes side of the discussion 
that resulted was strongly worded he said some of the 10 points in 
kohls reunification plan sounded like orders to east germany 
demanding irreversible changes in its political and economic 
system 
a separate tass report on gorbachevs comment to genscher was 
far milder the president said that under the present circumstances 
of rapid change in europe and improving relations between east and 
west it is especially important to support international 
stability and to strengthen security tass reported 
this suggests selfrestraint responsibility and deliberation 
in actions from all states and loyal cooperation on the basis of 
generally accepted principles tass added paraphrasing gorbachev 
genscher told reporters that he assured gorbachev there is 
not going to be a separate german course 
he said german rapprochement will occur only within general 
european rapprochement and we will do everything to create 
stable cooperative structures to ensure the security of europe 
genscher refused to discuss gorbachevs response 
tass also said that genscher and shevardnadze shared their 
desires to reach agreements on the reduction of strategic offensive 
weapons and conventional armed forces and on a ban on chemical 
weapons

a longtime heroin user has accepted a 
judges offer to spend two years in a zen buddhist monastery 
instead of going through a drug treatment program 
loudoun county va circuit judge james chamblin on monday gave 
keith brian scofield of sterling va the option of going through 
his sixth drug treatment program or entering the zen studies 
society mountain monastery in ulster county about 70 miles 
northwest of new york city 
conventional drug treatment sure doesnt produce many 
winners scofield said tuesday in a telephone interview from 
loudoun county jail in virginia ive been to some of the best in 
the country and believe me they just dont work 
after his release from the previous drug programs i lasted 
about a week before he went back on drugs he said 
the monasterys acting abbot junpo dennis kelly said scofield 
is the first criminal drug user the retreat has agreed to take in 
but kelly said several of the 20 people living at the monastery 
turned to buddhism to overcome drug addiction 
in the 60s and 70s i experimented with a lot of drugs 
experiences that should help him understand scofields problem 
kelly said i know right where hes coming from 
scofield 30 was convicted in november 1988 of heroin 
possession and released on probation he was arrested on a petty 
larceny charge last june and chamblin sentenced him to five years 
in prison for violating probation 
all but six months of that sentence was suspended because 
chamblin planned to order scofield to undergo drug treatment said 
paul maslakowski scofields attorney 
on monday chamblin agreed to scofields request to let him 
spend two years at the monastery instead of going through drug 
treatment 
the judge said get thee to a nunnery said court 
spokeswoman fay payne 
while visiting scofield in jail his brother joked that they 
ought to send me to a monastery instead of a drug treatment 
center he said we laughed about it but later when i was back 
upstairs reading i thought that id give it a try 
scofield said he has been reading books on zen buddhism for 
about a year he said he has had a drug problem off and on since he 
was 13 
if scofield violates monastery rules or leaves the retreat 
before his two years are up he probably will be sent back to jail 
maslakowski said 
it puts a lot of pressure on keith maslakowski said when 
a judge gives a guy a break like this he doesnt have much 
sympathy if he shows up before him again 
probation officers will be allowed into the monastery to check 
on scofield he said 
scofield will be released into the custody of his mother 
josephine regis who will take him to the monastery probably by 
this weekend maslakowski said 
his routine at the 1400acre retreat will include rising at 
430 am hard work through most of the day vegetarian meals 
eaten in silence periods of meditation and intensive study of 
philosophy kelly said 
scofield is a carpenter by trade and his skills will come in 
handy on repairs to monastery buildings and cutting firewood for 
the retreats boilers kelly said

president bush made three concessions at the 
malta summit that were overshadowed in the euphoria and confusion 
surrounding the firstever joint ussoviet presidential news 
conference 
those steps met longstanding soviet requests and marked a 
political milestone for a man who had reacted cautiously to the 
reforms of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
administration officials said tuesday however that the fine 
print still needed to be written on bushs offers involving the 
lifting of trade sanctions against moscow and a halt in us 
production of chemical weapons 
although the summit produced no clear arms control 
breakthroughs and was not expected to bush gave gorbachev these 
welcome bits of news 
he would take steps to ease tariffs on soviet exports to 
america 
he would seek observer status for the kremlin in a major 
international trade group 
he was altering his previous and for the soviets unpalatable 
proposal on chemical weapons seeking to sign a treaty for the june 
summit to destroy most us and soviet chemical weapons stockpiles 
several major us and soviet steps are necessary before bush 
grants the soviet union mostfavorednation status easing tariffs 
on soviet imports to the united states 
first the united states and the soviets must reach a commercial 
treaty said a us official who expects the american side to be 
in talks with the soviets in the next six or eight weeks bush 
proposed that he and gorbachev sign such a treaty at the summit 
they are planning in america in the last two weeks of june 
second bush must waive provisions of a 1974 law that barred 
mostfavorednation status for the soviet union until the kremlin 
eased its emigration policies soviet authorities have relaxed the 
rules and the emigration of jews and other minorities is headed 
for record levels this year 
at malta however bush told gorbachev he would not waive the 
1974 law until the soviet parliament passes legislation giving the 
new emigration rules greater permanence and the parliament is not 
due back in session until late january 
administration lawyers say bush can waive the law without 
consulting congress but it is not clear whether the senate or the 
full congress must approve a ussoviet commercial treaty 
according to us officials who spoke on condition they not be 
further identified 
once the sanctions are waived and the treaty signed bush plans 
to ask congress to lift a 300 million ceiling that it imposed on 
us government loans to the soviet union 
obtaining observer status for the soviets on the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade may be just as complex 
bush told gorbachev he wanted moscow to study gatt to encourage 
greater soviet engagement with the international market economy 
common market leaders already have advocated soviet observer 
status in the 97nation gatt a status already enjoyed by hungary 
and china 
the concession that bush made on chemical weapons was designed 
to speed progress on bilateral as well multilateral treaties 
officials said 
last september at the united nations bush offered to destroy 80 
percent of us chemical weapon stockpiles if the soviets reduced 
to the same level soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
responded that his country was willing to destroy all its chemical 
weapons 
further controversy developed over bushs statement that the 
united states planned to retain 2 percent of its chemical weapons 
until the 10th year of a proposed multilateral convention calling 
upon all nations to destroy their stocks within a decade 
administration officials later confirmed that this provision 
meant that the united states would continue to make a new 
generation of chemical weapons even after the multilateral 
convention was signed a provision that drew criticism from moscow 
and other capitals 
moreover bush said the united states would not destroy its 
last chemical weapons until all nations able to produce chemical 
weapons signed the multilateral treaty which is still under 
negotiation 
at malta bush told gorbachev he was willing to end us 
production of the new generation of weapons as soon as the 
multilateral convention takes effect 
although that gesture is expected to speed work on both the 
bilateral and the multilateral treaties a great deal of work 
remains to be done on both particularly finding the means to make 
sure that it is observed said administration arms control 
officials

for 129 million to become the secondhighest price for any hebrew 
manuscript 
a volume of prayers written in pesaro italy in 1480 went for 
794400 to an anonymous buyer who also paid 415000 for an 
incomplete bible made in spain in 1468

the protest group greenpeace on tuesday 
accused the navy of maliciousness in ramming its flagship as it 
protested the test launch of a trident ii missile 
the navy which acknowledged monday that it had shouldered 
the protest ship away from the test site said tuesday that it had 
not rammed the vessel 
we have a message for the navy greenpeace usa executive 
director peter bahouth told a news conference we are going to 
take legal action they are going to have to pay us damages 
he declined to give details or say how much the group might seek 
in damages for the alleged incident monday in the atlantic ocean 50 
miles off the florida coast just before the submarine tennessee 
fired the 265 million missile 
the navy denied that it rammed the 887ton ship greenpeace the 
service said that it respected the groups right to protest but 
that it also had a right under international law to protect itself 
on the high seas 
at the news conference greenpeace leaders showed videotapes of 
two vessels identified as the navy tugs grasp and kittiwake 
spraying the decks of the greenpeace and pulling alongside the 
tapes showed gaping holes in the hull of the greenpeace group 
leaders said the gashes resulted from rammings by the tugs 
the videotapes also showed greenpeace activists in an inflatable 
speedboat approach what appeared to be an antenna from a submerged 
submarine the groups leaders said the object was the radio mast 
of the tennessee 
the group said navy commandos cut the fuel lines of two 
inflatable speedboats and returned them to the mother ship no 
commandos appeared on the videotape 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said the navy didnt 
ram the greenpeace boat 
he said that the united states under international law 
reserves and will exercise its right to protect its vessels and 
crews engaged in lawful highseas activities and protect them from 
interference or other action by others that would endanger us 
vessels and their crews 
on monday the navy said that after repeated warnings the tugs 
had shouldered the greenpeace out of the safety arc of the 
test firing vice adm roger bacon commander of the atlantic 
submarine fleet said in cape canaveral fla that the tugs had 
used fire hoses against the greenpeace and that the fuel line of 
one inflatable speedboat had been cut after the other speedboat 
broke down 
the navy said monday that the greenpeace had sustained a hole 1 
foot in diameter 
the protest was part of a nuclearfree seas campaign the 
organization launched in 1987 according to bahouth the ship 
greenpeace replaced the rainbow warrior as the groups flagship 
after the latter vessel was mined by french security agents while 
it was protesting french nuclear tests in the pacific ocean 
we do expect to mix it up with the navy said greenpeace 
leader william m arkin thats the point of protesting that is 
why we were there but we had never expected this kind of force 
this kind of maliciousness 
he said the two navy vessels not only tore holes in the hull of 
the greenpeace but rammed it while a helicopter chartered by the 
group was attempting to land on its decks he said the navys 
action in pouring water down its stacks could have caused an 
explosion

the united states should increase legal 
immigration to fill expected worker shortages and provide 150000 
slots a year for residents now able to the communist nations of 
eastern europe a report recommended tuesday 
the report by two scholars at the american enterprise institute 
a think tank suggested that more immigrants be preselected for 
specific skills and occupations that are absent or in short supply 
in this country 
currently most immigrants are admitted because they have family 
members in the united states according to authors ben wattenberg 
a senior fellow and karl zinsmeister an adjunct fellow at the 
institute only 5 percent of immigrant visas now go to those with 
an occupational sikll 
the report said many researchers believe that america is 
entering an era of longterm labor shortage and concluded that 
immigrants would go to regions and occupations where the demand was 
greatest 
noting that thousands of talented persons want to leave 
eastern europe the report said that its an appropriate moment 
to sharply increase our acceptance of east european immigrants 
we propose a program of liberty visas 150000 legal slots 
per year for 10 years for those leaving eastern europe the 
report said 
such people the report added have been doubly impeded 
because the united states would not let them in without having 
relatives here and the communist states previously would not let 
them out

a french mercenary in control of 
this indian ocean nation denied tuesday that he assassinated 
president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
various diplomatic sources have suggested bob denard either 
directed or personally carried out the assassination nov 26 by 
firing a rocketpropelled grenade through the window of the 
presidential palace in moroni the capital 
in cairo president hosni mubarak of egypt chairman of the 
organization of african unity expressed deep concern tuesday 
over the situation here and said continued mercenaries control 
represents a flagrant challenge to international law and an 
aggression on legitimacy 
i call on the international community to take all necessary 
measures to right the situation in the comoro islands a member 
of the oau mubarak said in a press statement he issued as oau 
chairmnan 
i am not the assassin of president abdallah denard said at 
a news conference at the headquarters of the 500man presidential 
guard he commands 
he led a coup in 1975 that ousted abdallah from power and an 
operation that returned him to the presidency in 1978 
denard was convicted of playing a role in a failed coup in the 
westcentral african nation of benin in 1977 and a paris court 
reopened the case tuesday in an apparent bid to pressure him to 
leave the comoro islands 
benin gained independence from france in 1960 and the comoro 
islands in 1975 
diplomats said there had been no major crackdown or arrests 
following abdallahs assassination and confirmed that denard and 
two dozen white mercenaries under his command were in control of 
the islands 
the mercenaries are in effective control of the sceurity 
situation and the south african government is leading efforts to 
encourage bob denard to go into exile said the us charge 
daffairs karl danga 
south africa has major investments in the island 
in the first major protest of denard since abdallah was slain 
hundreds of people jeered the mercenary as he left a mosque after 
saying prayers tuesday the crowd chanted denard is an 
assassin and mercenaries go home 
diplomatic sources have said denard is negotiating how much 
money he can take with him if he leaves and whether his mercenaries 
will be allowed to leave as well 
denard denied that why should i leave he said 
he acknowledged that south africa had asked him to depart but 
added that isnt good enough a reason 
the court of appeal in paris ordered the lower correctional 
tribunal to reexamine denards conspiracy conviction for 
recruiting and leading 80 men to topple president ahmed kerekou of 
benin on jan 16 1977 
denard was sentenced to death in absentia by a benin court in 
1987 
after denard returned abdallah to power in 1978 a presidential 
guard led by french and belgian mercenaries kept him in office with 
the tacit approval of france and south africa 
south africa reportedly provided 5 million a year to the 
islands including 2 million to finance the presidential guard

americans and other hotel guests 
trapped in the financial district for four days praised the conduct 
of rebel troops occupying their hotels but were desperate tuesday 
to get out of the battle zone 
negotiations to evacuate the guests including about 215 
americans bogged down just as a power failure plunged the makati 
shopping and commercial district into darkness 
lt col rafael galvez a rebel leader and tourism 
undersecretary rafael alunan the government negotiator agreed to 
resume talks wednesday 
dempsey pagan an american businessman based in the philippines 
said people in nearby condominiums were running out of food he 
said some dashed across ayala avenue at great risk to buy supplies 
at the only open supermarket opposite the intercontinental hotel 
the rebels might be able to hold out forever he said 
because the government cannot really bomb this place in order to 
kill the rebels you have to bomb the whole of makati and they 
know the government cannot do that they have the financial center 
of the country by the neck 
ronald manthey a lawyer from dallas said were just trying 
to figure out what we can do to get out of the financial 
district and this hotel 
the rebels will not directly stop us from leaving the hotel 
but the rebels have very strong armament positions around the hotel 
and are in constant fighting with the government forces which have 
also surrounded the entire district 
in washington the bush administration expressed concern for the 
americans and said some uncertainty remained about their status 
you can be assured that the pentagon has contingency plans for 
everything white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters but he would not say what military steps the united 
states might take 
state department spokesman richard boucher said we greatly 
appreciate the restraint demonstrated so far by the philippine 
government forces in light of our expressions of concern about the 
safety of americans 
we hope that such restraint will continue on both sides and 
that agreement can be reached on arrangements to safely evacuate 
innocent civilians 
about 15 male guests were in the intercontinental lobby when 
journalists entered with government negotiators seven hours after 
the guests were supposed to have been evacuated tuesday morning 
about 20 journalists were driven to the hotel in an armored 
vehicle captured by the rebels in fighting sunday 
what nobody in this hotel can understand is why when 
everybody is clamoring for a ceasefire the government seems to 
ignore the pleas said a 24yearold briton who asked that his 
name not be used 
evacuation was delayed by sporadic automatic weapons fire as 
loyalist advanced against the estimated 400 rebellious army scout 
rangers holed up in more than 22 buildings 
about 50 pieces of luggage were lined up in the lobby ready for 
loading into two dozen buses waiting to evacuate 350 guests most 
of whom waited in their rooms 
dim lights powered by the hotel generator shone in the lobby and 
in a bar and restaurant on the ground floor two security guards in 
blue uniforms stood at the front desk 
some guests asked the journalists about conflicting reports of 
events on television and radio their only sources of information 
because newspapers had not been available since sunday the day 
after rebels moved into the district 
carroll greathouse of stamford conn said the hotel management 
had been superb and the rebels behaved admirably 
the rangers have conducted themselves as gentlemen with a low 
profile although theyre upstairs on the roof he said 
allan campbell 61 of lancaster pa and peter butler 64 of 
washington dc sat in a fourthfloor corridor talking with other 
guests they said they were with a dallasbased company named ipac 
that had recruited 1300 filipinos to work at the us naval base 
on diego garcia in the indian ocean 
the rebels seemed genuinely interested in getting the 
foreigners out of the hotel they said 
campbell described the long delay in evacuation as very very 
frustrating and butler said nobody seems to know whats going 
on and communication is very poor 
he said a rebel captain had a long talk with them making the 
rebel case against president corazon aquino 
in an impromptu news conference lt col galvez expressed the 
hope that filipinos would understand the pure intentions of the 
mutineers 
we also do not want bloodshed and we hope this will all come 
to an end soon we are willing to stop all of this he declared 
but said the rebels wwould not surrender 
peter sheldon 50 of australia said the previous four days had 
been pretty harrowing 
guests were told to go to the corridors when they heard 
shooting he said and we dont know who we are hostages for for 
the rebels or for the soldiers

a scathing report released tuesday by a 
citizens group says 20 years of stale uninspired city leadership 
has made this historic coastal city a seemingly underdeveloped 
country 
the eightpage report titled is savannah growing senile and 
prepared by renaissance savannah is highly critical of the citys 
elected officials media and business leaders 
julie smith a chatham county commissioner and cochairperson of 
the group said the report was compiled from comments and 
observations by members of renaissance savannah during the past 12 
months 
the yearold group identifies itself as a grassroots 
organization representing all sectors of the city and aimed at 
revitalizing savannah 
whats said here is what i think weve all muttered over beer 
and cocktails said larry lee president of the downtown 
neighborhood association and a member of renaissance savannah 
the report compares savannah to a person suffering from 
senility saying both take refuge in the past 
of mayor john rousakis who is serving his fifth fouryear term 
it says our city has a mayor who is a ship without a rudder 
bring him a proposal hell say yes or no or maybe then if 
he says yes you owe him some cities have mayors who dont wait 
for someone to propose a solution they bring the parties 
together reconcile the differences and get agreement on making 
something happen 
rousakis questioned the validity of the report 
its obviously a political effort he said the 91 race 
for mayor is two years away and this is the opening shot 
chatham county commission chairman robert mccorkle accused ms 
smith a republican of trying to get black savannah residents to 
support the gop 
the report also criticized city manager don mendonsa saying he 
doesnt realize what an oppressive bureaucracy he has built 
honest hardworking and well respected he is one who 
manages by control and not by growing creative independent 
enthusiastic managers it said the result of his 20plusyear 
career in savannah is an organization that avoids risk and makes 
life difficult for many 
mendonsa responded that to his knowledge none of the 
renaissance members has talked to me about anything 
the report said a 20year period with the same mayor city 
attorney and city manager will be up for grabs during 1991 and 
added that then the black community may be in a position to 
exercise the influence it has long been denied 
the report said savannah has comparatively few residents who 
have four years of college and the leadership needs to be more 
representative of its blue collar roots 
of the savannah area chamber of commerce it said the leaders 
of the chamber of commerce have rarely heard much less 
comprehended differing opinions within the community 
the report challenged journalists and news executives to move 
their product beyond mediocrity and give attention both to what is 
positive about savannah and to that which would challenge our 
elected leaders to better serve our community 
don harwood general manager of the savannah morning news and 
savannah evening press rejected the report as the opinion of a few 
people 
the media are very responsive and responsible in my opinion 
he said

destruction of documents that could be used in criminal trials 
about 2000 east germans tried to force their way into the 
secret police headquarters in suhl and a delegation of the angry 
citizens eventually was let inside adn said it quoted local

already been destroyed

headquarters in the city of erfurt adn added while several 
hundred citizens kept watch outside secret police headquarters in 
the northern city of rostock

american u2 pilot gary powers and major soviet dissident natan 
sharansky made him an east german superlawyer during the cold war 
but his ties to ousted communist leaders led briefly to his 
arrest tuesday 
the official east german news agency adn announced that vogel 
was arrested on suspicion of criminal extortion but early 
wednesday adn said he had been released that the allegation of 
criminal extortion had proven to be unfounded and that 
prosecutors had apologized to him 
adn said the allegation concerned vogels representation of the 
fugitive alexander schalckgolodkowski but prosecutors had 
determined that vogel during his representation of 
schalckgolodkowski had done his duty as a lawyer of which 
upholding the pledge of secrecy is a part 
for three decades the 64year old lawyer handled spy swaps 
negotiated the release of political prisoners and helped make sure 
the dark doings of east germanys ousted leaders stayed in the 
shadows 
once one of only a few dozen private lawyers in all of east 
germany vogel for a while was just one of dozens of top communist 
party officials under fire following reports of massive corruption 
vogels international reputation got its start in 1962 with his 
role in arranging the swap of powers the american pilot shot down 
over siberia in 1961 for soviet master spy rudolf abel 
he oversaw the spectacular february 1986 swap on a snowy 
glienicke bridge at the edge of berlin of soviet human rights 
activist natan sharansky and three westerners held on spy charges 
in the east for five east germans convicted of spying in the west 
despite his prominent role vogel preferred to stay in the 
shadows it was not until 1984 that he gave his first interview to 
western television 
inside east germany vogel was a source of hope for thousands of 
east germans imprisoned for political activities who hoped to gain 
passage to west by being bought by the bonn government 
for years east germany disposed of thousands of its most 
troublesome citizes by allowing them to emigrate to west germany 
for a price that was often negotiated by vogel 
as the senior east german official responsible for 
humanitarian affairs after the berlin wall went up in 1961 
vogel handled thousands of cases of east german political prisoners 
who were able to go west as a result of his intervention 
vogel also bailed out the families of top communist officials to 
whom he was so closely linked 
in 1984 he persuaded the niece of thenprime minister willi 
stoph to return home from the east german embassy in prague 
czechoslovakia where she was seeking passage to the west he 
persuaded her to apply to leave from east berlin so as not to 
embarrass the party leadership 
her passage to west germany was secured within days of her 
return 
vogel was born in the silesian village of wilhelmsthal ceded to 
poland after world war ii the son of strict roman catholic 
parents he studied law in jena and leipzig he joined the party 
only in 1981 
a veteran of the war vogel practiced in the justice ministry of 
the fledgling communist state before setting up private practice in 
east berlin in 1954 one of only a few east german lawyers allowed 
to do so 
according to west german newspaper reports vogel had at least 
one mercedesbenz car went skiing in austria and vacationed in 
spain

the white house dealing with aftershocks from 
the malta summit attempted to quell criticism from conservatives 
tuesday and play down any differences between president bush and 
vice president dan quayle on the soviet union 
on another summit topic the administration said the meeting 
enabled bush to look ahead to possible budget savings two years 
from now as a result of likely arms reductions 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that if an 
agreement is signed next year to slash longrange nuclear missiles 
i think that could have an impact certainly on the budget that 
would be submitted the following january 
bush on his first day back in the oval office got a standing 
ovation from his cabinet summoned to the white house for a report 
on his two days of talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bush ignored questions from reporters about quayle who has 
offered a more guarded and skeptical postsummit assessment of the 
soviets than bush has 
quayle in an interview with the washington post called the 
soviet union a totalitarian government and said i dont think 
theyve changed much in foreign policy 
bush on the other hand said after the summit we stand at 
the threshold of a brand new era of ussoviet relations he 
also said gorbachevs endorsement of reforms in eastern europe 
absolutely mandates new thinking by the west 
explaining the difference bushs national security adviser 
brent scowcroft said we have an administration that is very 
closely aligned but i think it probably not possible for people to 
speak literally with one voice 
and there may from time to time be difference of perspective 
but theres no difference in the substance of the policies were 
pursuing 
for months quayle has voiced a harder line than bush toward the 
soviet union it has been suggested the vice president was 
deliberately playing to the conservatives as part of a white house 
strategy to keep their support 
but quayle said tuesday that theres no good guy bad guy 
strategy between himself and bush 
quayle in an interview with knightridder newspaper editors and 
reporters tempered his comments to the post saying he should have 
called the soviet union an authoritarian rather than a 
totalitarian state 
quayle credited the soviets with remarkable changes in economic 
reforms and their campaign of openness known as glasnost where 
there has been a lack of new thinking on the part of the soviet 
union is in the area of foreign policy and particularly in central 
america the vice president said 
bush and quayle talked several times over the summit weekend 
and then discussed the post interview when they met tuesday 
morning officials said 
quayle has stated repeatedly that his no 1 goal is to be a 
loyal effective vice president to george bush if he felt he were 
in any way off the reservation he would get back on said quayle 
spokesman david beckwith 
in his first public comment since returning from malta bush 
said in remarks prepared for a banquet of the national republican 
congressional committee that he made clear to gorbachev america 
does not seek to exploit events in eastern europe but at the same 
time was up front with president gorbachev on central america and 
the destabilizing flow of arms into that region from nations 
receiving soviet support both of us agreed we dont have to 
sacrifice candor to build a better relationship 
as long as these democratic changes keep moving inside the 
soviet union and in eastern europe i think the united states ought 
to be out there trying to help not in some kind of superior 
manner but trying to say look heres what works bush told a 
crowd of 600 at the 1000aplate gop dinner straying extensively 
from his prepared text 
he noted that soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has 
said the soviets are not looking for a bailout from the united 
states thats good because we dont have any money anyway 
quipped bush 
some conservatives have expressed unhappiness over the summit 
saying that bush gave the soviets economic concessions without 
receiving anything in return such as a commitment to keep 
moscowmade weapons out of central america 
fitzwater minimized those objections i think its quite 
natural to expect that when the president lays out as broad and 
comprehensive a set of initiatives as he did there in malta that 
there are going to be those who have some concern about them 
and we certainly will be ready and willing to talk to anybody 
about them he said but we dont anticipate huge 
difficulties 
at the summit bush endorsed giving moscow observer status at 
the worlds leading economic regulatory body and proposed june as a 
target date for completing a trade agreement granting the soviet 
union mostfavorednation status which would result in an easing 
of trade barriers 
fitzwater said the issue of economic cooperation was not linked 
to any soviet concessions 
bush meanwhile made a telephone call to british prime minister 
margaret thatcher to offer assurances he wasnt taking sides 
against her on the pace of the economic integration of europe 
several major british newspapers had interpreted bushs remarks 
at a briefing monday for nato leaders as a rebuff that had isolated 
mrs thatcher from britains 11 partners in the european economic 
community 
bush had told the allies that the reforms in eastern europe 
required a continued perhaps even intensified effort of the 12 
to integrate and become a magnet for the reform process 
scowcroft said bush called mrs thatcher to clarify some of 
the items that were in the british press saying there was no 
change in us policy scowcroft said the administration supports 
economic integration but that the details of it and the pace of 
it are up to the europeans not the united states 
mrs thatcher faces a lone battle at a summit this weekend of 
the 12nation european economic community against frenchled plans 
for monetary integration and communitywide rules on labor unions 
and employment

a federal appeals court ruling was hailed 
tuesday as the wedge that could pry open the internal revenue 
services files on taxpayers the agency takes to court 
however a spokeswoman for the irs in washington said the files 
are already available to taxpayers upon request 
this is a major decision a major civil rights decision the 
appeals court has granted the taxpayer the right to know what the 
secret files contain and to use the information in his own 
defense said paul desfosses of the national coalition of irs 
whistleblowers 
in a telephone interview from his pocatello idaho office 
desfosses said the coalition is a watchdog group of current and 
former irs employees 
theres no telling how many innocent taxpayers have been 
convicted of crimes in the past that they were innocent of he 
said 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new orleans last week 
ordered the irs to open its files in a dallas case of a father and 
son accused of helping to prepare false tax returns and conspiring 
to defraud the federal government 
stephen m buford 36 now of chicago was convicted on all 
counts his father bob a buford 61 of dallas was convicted of 
conspiracy they filed an appeal in 1988 
the 5th circuit also ordered a new trial for the bufords saying 
the judge in the case gave erroneous instructions to the jury 
the two men referred questions to their attorney michael minns 
of houston 
its a major breakthrough minns said it means a lot of 
things to the individual taxpayer if you want these confidential 
records youre entitled to them if youre accused of something 
you have a right to these records 
the irs authorized what are known as individual master files on 
each taxpayer in 1984 as part of a fiveyear plan said desfosses 
who testified on behalf of the bufords the irs files are kept in a 
computer in west virginia he said 
unless youre familiar with it its something right out of 
george orwell he said 
the computer has everything you can possibly imagine in it 
under your social security number minns said 
the 5th circuit opinion said each irs file includes 
primarily a breakdown of all information relevant to the tax 
status of the individual such as tax and refund payments filing 
status and number of children 
desfosses said the files also contain information on any 
taxpayer activity that involves a government agency such as 
selling property or obtaining a building permit 
in the dallas trial prosecutors claimed that stephen buford had 
not filed his personal tax returns from 1980 to 1984 minns said 
buford said he had filed and he asked the irs to let him see 
his individual master file to prove it 
the irs refused to provide the file portions of which are in 
code and instead provided handwritten notes it said summarized the 
file 
the us district judge hearing the case ordered the irs to let 
him see the file to determine if buford could use it in his 
defense however the judge never looked at the file according to 
the opinion 
on nov 29 the 5th circuit ordered the judge to look at 
bufords file 
if this reveals that stephen actually did not file his 
personal tax returns in the years 1980 through 1984 no harm was 
done if on the other hand it turns out that stephen did file as 
he says then he must be granted the use of that evidence at the 
new trial which we direct the 5th circuit said 
although irs records are open desfosses said the agency doesnt 
open files to people who are charged with tax crimes he claimed 
the irs has wrongly prosecuted taxpayers based on fraudulently 
prepared handwritten assessments not the original documents 
the appeals court ruling is significant because it means the 
irs may no longer use handwritten or secondary records they are 
going to have to use original records desfosses said 
ellen murphy public relations director for the irs said the 
agency keeps tax information for 200 million accounts on its master 
files and does not gather information surreptitiously on taxpayers 
it does have confidential information in it your tax matters 
are not subject to disclosure but you can call or write and ask 
for it its free she said 
the files are coded to reduce the amount of computer space the 
records use she said taxpayers can see the files under the 
freedom of information act and the privacy act she said

crash investigators said tuesday that a 
colombian jet carrying 107 people disintegrated in a fireball two 
weeks ago moments after a bomb blew a hole in the fuselage and 
flooded the passenger cabin with fuel 
the disclosure came hours after a judge investigating drug 
traffickers was assassinated the fourth judge killed in 15 weeks 
the government did not say who planted the bomb under a 
strategically located seat in the 15th row of the avianca airlines 
boeing 727 bound for cali from bogota 
but suspicion immediately fell on drug lords who targeted 
schools hotels restaurants and other public buildings in bombings 
throughout colombia after the government declared war on illegal 
drug operations last august the 201 bombings have killed 29 people 
and wounded 238 
authorities assume the traffickers are trying to force the 
government to stop extraditing colombian drug suspects president 
virgilio barcos administration has sent nine suspects to the 
united states since launching its antinarcotics offensive 
minister of government carlos lemos told a news conference 
tuesday the airliner bomb is perhaps a sign of what lays ahead 
for colombia lemos is acting as president while barco is on a 
state visit to japan 
flight 203 exploded minutes after taking off from bogotas 
international airport on a nov 27 domestic flight killing all 
aboard 
investigators said a bomb blast ruptured the fuel tank in the 
right wing 
the bomb was placed strategically under seat 15f which is 
very close to the fuel tank that burst and caused the fire the 
destroyed the aircraft the director of the civil aviation 
authority yezid castano told reporters 
around an emergency door there is evidence of an outward force 
of such power that objects inside the plane were blown out at 
20000 feet per second 
police sought a mystery man suspected of planting the bomb 
castano said he said one of two men who had reserved seats 15e and 
15f returned to the avianca counter after passing through security 
the man had purchased two tickets one for himself in the name 
of julio santodomingo the other in the name of alberto prieto 
prieto stayed aboard santodomingo left the avianca counter 
and vanished 
the real julio santodomingo is owner of avianca airlines 
telephone numbers left by the man being sought were those of 
other people on tuesday judge bernardo jaramillo uribe was shot 
dead on a stroll in medellin hub of this south american countrys 
drug trade 
last june jaramillo ordered destroyed 770 pounds of cocaine and 
five modern processing laboratories seized by police in segovia 
175 miles northwest of bogota 
jaramillo was also looking into the massacre of 43 people in 
segovia on nov 11 1988 the government blamed a paramilitary 
assassination team financed by drug traffickers 
another of his cases was the murder of col franklin quintero 
police chief in antioquia state quintero was shot on aug 18 in 
medellin again the government blamed drug traffickers 
that same day a leading presidential candidate sen luis 
carlos galan was murdered and the government declared a major 
drive against drug barons 
the avianca flight was bombed five days after police raided a 
hideout they said belonged to pablo escobar reputed leader of the 
medellin drug cartel police said that they almost caught escobar 
who fled into the jungle while his bodyguards battled 300 police 
and soldiers 
an unidentified man who said he represented drug traffickers 
told a radio network the medellin cartel bombed the flight in 
retaliation for the raid

the head of justice denied an advocacy group for 
the wrongfully convicted is being held on federal drug and 
conspiracy charges after an fbi agent recognized his photograph 
from a fundraiser authorities said tuesday 
a professor who studies crime and supported justice denied 
questioned the fbis timing and motivation in arresting the groups 
president private investigator jim humphreys 
humphreys 40 was being held in dallas lew sterrett justice 
center on 10 counts each of possession of cocaine and intent to 
distribute cocaine and one count of conspiracy a jailer at the 
center said 
he was arrested monday after an fbi agent noticed a newspaper 
story about a saturday fundraiser for the newly formed justice 
denied 
the group is supported by randall dale adams who was freed from 
prison after his murder conviction was examined in the film the 
thin blue line and lenell geter an engineer whose robbery 
conviction was overturned in 1984 with humphreys help 
we happened to see the story but we knew he humphreys was 
probably in this area fbi spokesman woody specht said 
the charges filed nov 15 stem from 10 incidents during which 
humphreys allegedly sold between one gram and eight ounces of 
cocaine in oklahoma city in 1985 the charges are part of a 
57count indictment returned by an oklahoma city grand jury last 
month specht said 
oklahoma city fbi spokesman dan vogel said the indictment was 
sealed and details could not be released 
humphreys bond was set at 25000 by magistrate william f 
sanders specht said 
ronald huff a professor of public policy and management at ohio 
state university said humphreys arrest may represent a backlash 
against the efforts of justice denied huff who recently completed 
a fiveyear study on wrongful convictions attended the fundraiser 
there is some concern about vindictiveness in dallas huff 
said in a telephone interview jim humphreys has played a key 
role in helping prove the innocence of some of these people which 
has caused him to be persona non grata 
huff said the timing of the arrest just two days after the 
fundraiser was very curious 
it seems illogical to me why a fellow would put himself on tv 
and allow a lot of photographs if hes wanted it seems suspicious 
to me on the surface he said 
specht was not immediately available to respond to huffs 
comments and other fbi officials referred all questions to specht 
humphreys investigative work helped clear geter an engineer 
who spent 16 months in a texas prison for a robbery before another 
suspect was identified geter is chairman of justice denieds 
advisory board 
there was no answer tuesday at geters home in columbia sc 
also attending the fundraiser was adams who spent 12 years 
behind bars for the 1976 shooting death of a dallas patrolman 
the thin blue line questioned the testimony of prosecution 
witnesses in the case a state appeals court later overturned the 
conviction and authorities chose not to seek a retrial 
calls to the justice denied office werent answered tuesday 
edith neely crosley treasurer of justice denied told the 
dallas times herald she had not heard about humphreys arrest but 
felt it would not hurt the organization 
there are too many people involved with it and they are too 
dedicated to it we will continue on she said

a connecticut woman in whose 
back yard police found ammunition and explosives buried was charged 
with terrorism late tuesday by salvadoran authorities 
jennifer casolo 28 spent more than four hours behind closed 
doors making a sworn deposition to military judge guillermo romero 
im being taken to the womens prison its a place ive taken 
many delegations a place where ive interviewed many prisoners i 
guess now ill be on the other side she told reporters when she 
emerged from the judges chambers 
the judge avoided contact with reporters waiting at the court 
but ms casolo and her lawyer salvador ibarra both said she had 
been charged under the terrorism law with possession of weapons of 
war 
she faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted 
ms casolo a native of thomaston conn and a former seattle 
resident has spent nearly five years here as the representative of 
christian educational seminars a san antoniobased organization 
that arranges factfinding tours for visiting americans including 
congressmen 
her house was raided nov 25 by police who found more than 
20000 rounds of assault rifle ammunition explosives and detonator 
caps buried in her back yard 
she has denied complicity with the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front which is waging a 10yearold war 
against a succession of usbacked governments she has said she 
rented the house where the munitions were found only three months 
ago and that she has been traveling much of that time 
i have faith in all the people who have written me letters in 
their prayers i cant say i have faith in the system to find me 
innocent but i believe my innocence will shine through she said 
before being driven off to prison 
she had spent the previous 10 days under arrest at national 
police headquarters 
ms casolo was arrested in the middle of a major offensive the 
guerrillas launched nov 11 the capital and countryside have been 
relatively quiet in recent days but the insurgents say the push 
which has claimed the lives of well over 1000 rebels soldiers and 
civilians will continue 
former us attorney general ramsey clark traveled to el 
salvador to assist in ms casolos defense he said before leaving 
for the united states late tuesday that he thought her prospects 
for acquittal were good 
the accusations against me are false said ms casolo 
this is a first step and the rest will be decided by the long 
judicial process here 
clark said he would return to help with future phases of the 
trial he had said shortly after arrival late last week that 
deportation was probably ms casolos best bet 
but she told reporters tuesday let us prove our innocence 
publicly were not going to go behind the scenes 
guerrillas meanwhile took over two small neighborhoods on the 
western side of the city before dawn tuesday held them for several 
hours and then left the armed forces said the military press 
office said one soldier was killed and five were wounded in the 
fighting 
soldiers came in after the guerrillas went back to the 
volcano a resident of escalon north said 
a dusktodawn curfew that has been reduced to 11 pm to 5 am 
in the capital remains in effect in zacatecoluca 25 miles 
southeast of san salvador because of persistent fighting the 
armed forces said

toky0 ap ussoviet armscontrol agreements will not stop 
the upgrading of japans military capability foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe said tuesday 
watanabe said in reply to a question by foreign journalists that 
japan strongly supports progress toward arms reduction 
he said japan has been criticized for insufficiencies in its own 
defense and that the military buildup that has been under way for 
years is for the purpose of securing our selfdefense 
it is separate from arms reductions from that point of view 
so our own efforts for improving our selfdefense are not expected 
to change at the moment 
newspaper reports here said last week that japans next defense 
budget will show a routine 6 percent growth 
watanabe had been asked whether armscontrol developments 
signaled at the ussoviet summit in malta would affect japans 
defense program 
his reply demonstrated japans removal from rapidly improving 
bigpower relations in europe and the different strategic situation 
in the far east 
the japanese taxpayer seems unlikely to get any early benefit 
from an end of the cold war washington is talking about 
substantial cuts in military budgets and us secretary of defense 
dick cheney said recently evidence exists that the soviets have 
reduced military spending 
japan however is looking for steady growth the asahi shimbun 
and other newspapers reported last week that the finance ministry 
had agreed on an increase of just under 6 percent in the defense 
budget for the fiscal year starting next april 
japans constitution imposed by us occupation authorities 
after world war ii disavows war and the use of military force 
japan depends for its defense on both its own military forces 
and us forces obligated by treaty to help japan watanabe noted 
we are very much concerned about this question of the position 
of the united states on naval forces he added 
when president bush said he and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev disagreed at malta about reductions in naval forces he 
had in mind the vast pacific 
under gorbachev the soviet union has suggested that japan talk 
about sovietjapanese military issues japan has refused always 
citing its obligation to the united states under the defense 
treaty the united states also rejects talking about naval 
reductions in the pacific 
japans defense budget will be about 278 billion roughly 1 
percent of gross national product asahi said the us defense 
budget is more than 10 times as large the united states devotes 
about 6 percent of its gross national product to defense 
japan has cool relations with moscow and demands that the 
soviets return a group of islands off northern japan that soviet 
troops took in the last days of world war ii the dispute is the 
main issue blocking agreement on a peace treaty between the two 
countries

jurors in the trial of the policeman whose shooting 
of a black motorcyclist sparked three days of rioting must now 
decide if the officer fired coldly and deliberately or in 
selfdefense attorneys said in final arguments tuesday 
the manslaughter trial of officer william lozano 31 went to 
the jury late in the day dade county circuit judge john farina 
told jurors to elect a foreman and to begin deliberations wednesday 
morning after almost seven weeks of jury selection and testimony 
closely followed by an entire city 
the shooting resulted in three days of fires looting and 
violence and police bought new antiriot eqipment and put all 
officers on notice in case the verdict touches off renewed racial 
violence 
twice before in this decade riots broke out when white officers 
were acquitted in the slayings of blacks 
tuesdays final arguments were broadcast live on miami radio and 
television 
but defense attorney roy black reminded jurors they should 
concentrate only on the facts of the case not on potential unrest 
caused by their verdict 
this case has nothing to do with racial prejudice said 
black your verdict has meaning only in its truth to the case and 
its effects on a police officer 
assistant state attorney don horn told the jurors lozano had 
violated the law and police policy when he shot clement lloyd 23 
in the head on the night of jan 16 
lloyd and his 24yearold passenger allan blanchard both 
black died blanchard from injuries suffered in the subsequent 
crash 
he intentionally placed himself out there said horn of 
lozanos position near the path of the oncoming motorcycle he 
had time to pull the gun aim the gun concentrate on the 
motorcycle and fire as it passed on his left 
in a rebuttal of blacks argument chief assistant state 
attorney john hogan the lead prosecutor told jurors they need not 
find that lozano acted out of malice only that he was guilty of 
negligence 
horn dismissed lozanos testimony that he fired in selfdefense 
noting conflicts with prosecution witnesses and his initial 
statements to investigators 
hes lying hes lying thats why he changed his story 
horn said the story is not worthy of belief 
horn said all the prosecution witnesses had heard the motorcycle 
approaching from at least a block away while lozano claimed he 
never noticed it until it was almost upon him 
he stepped out there he decided he was going to shoot and he 
shot horn said all he had to do was step behind the police 
car 
but defense attorney black called the case a political attempt 
to dampen ethnic unrest 
hes sort of like a pawn caught up in forces beyond his 
control black said 
he called prosecution arguments that lozano had the time and the 
duty to retreat from the advancing motorcycle a threat to good law 
enforcement 
five of the last seven officers killed in the miami area died 
because they did not draw quickly enough he said 
black read from lozanos job evaluations which called him calm 
in the face of confrontation 
this is the man they would have you believe is some sort of a 
bloodthirsty triggerhappy police officer but its simply not 
true he said 
lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter and faces a 
maximum of 30 years in jail on each count 
jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began nov 
15 jury selection took more than three weeks 
the motorcycle shooting occurred on martin luther kings 
birthday as miami began a week of celebration leading up to the 
super bowl lozano and his partner were stopped on a street in a 
black neighborhood 
another police car was chasing lloyds motorcycle which raced 
past the street where lozano stood the officer fired one shot 
killing lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a 
car 
within an hour after the shooting an angry crowd gathered at 
the scene and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles 
by the time the violence ended three days later one looter had 
been shot to death 11 people were wounded and 13 buildings had 
been burned down in the overtown and liberty city neighborhoods

us embassy officials in manila met a great 
number of americans on buses carrying trapped civilians to safety 
from besieged downtown hotels a state department spokeswoman said 
tuesday night 
weve heard that all the hotels have been evacuated said 
the spokeswoman mary yates 
she said the department was not sure what would happen next but 
it just continues to be good news from manila 
consular officers met the 30 buses being used in pairs on the 
hotel shuttle at a reception center established at a shopping 
center near the airport theyve seen a great number of 
americans yates said 
but she said were not going to be able to get into numbers 
for some time of how many americans were evacuated 
an estimated 215 americans were among some 2000 foreigners 
trapped for four days in hotels by the military rebellion that had 
killed at least 77 people 
before the government of cory aquino and the rebels established 
a ceasefire to permit evacuation of the hotels the bush 
administration had urged restraint on both sides 
president bush who ordered us jets to fly over rebel bases to 
prevent their use on the first day of the coup attempt was said to 
be keeping options open national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said that aquino thus far had not requested additional us 
military support 
there had been reports from manila that insurgents seeking to 
oust aquino unhappy over us support for her government might 
not release trapped americans 
but a statement issued wednesday said the insurgents executive 
committee decided late tuesday to free all the americans because 
these american tourists are not our enemy 
state department spokesman richard boucher said there was no 
indication that any of the americans have been the targets of 
attack 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and other us officials 
sought to minimize the remaining threat left to aquino suggesting 
she now clearly has the upper hand in the struggle its been a 
gradual reassertion of control by the government fitzwater said 
in honolulu air force lt col tom boyd spokesman for the us 
pacific command said there were no us troop movements or plans 
to deploy special units from hawaii to deal with the situation in 
manila 
even at us bases in the philippines military officials are 
merely monitoring the situation not setting up for more us 
involvement he said us troops and their dependents in the 
philippines are under minimum travel restrictions which means they 
may travel to and from the bases and their homes offbase but not 
much else boyd said

national drug director william j bennett and 
budget director richard darman are apart by more than a couple of 
hundred million dollars on spending to fight drugs in 1991 and 
president bush may settle the dispute an administration official 
says 
its a big enough gap that its likely to have to go to the 
president said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the recently approved antidrug budget for the 1990 fiscal year 
totaled 88 billion which congress had boosted by 900 million 
over bushs request of 79 billion 
id expect to see a real increase in 1991 not just an 
adjustment for inflation the official said in an interview monday

a woman who was subjected as a child to josef 
mengeles notorious experiments on twins said the nazi medical data 
gathered from her suffering should never be used in scientific 
research 
eva mozes kor told her story monday at a boston university 
conference on nazi doctors and parallels in modern medicine some 
in the audience of about 300 people wept and when she finished many 
stood and cheered her 
no one should benefit from brutal crimes said kor a 
hungarian jew and president of candles which stands for children 
of auschwitz nazi deadly lab experiments 
some biomedical ethicists contend that the issue is moot 
because nazi research already has been cited in american and 
british journals they argue that the data despite its source 
have the potential to save human life

on thursday cbs 48 hours is taking at look 
at west point while abcs ted koppel has afoot an unusual 
superpower game played by top soviet and american officials most 
of them now out of office 
its an interesting double bill for what will be the 48th 
anniversary of japans attack on pearl harbor but the better show 
is easily abcs the koppel report the blue conspiracy that 
preempts primetime live 
the sort of tv exercise made possible by a grant from glasnost 
abcs hour has its soviet and american participants playing a 
crisis management game whose situations but not the players 
reactions or decisions are scripted 
such exercises have in recent years become popular in the 
government the military and in certain hatcheries that prepare 
future diplomats for what the students are assured will be the real 
world 
with the shows makebelieve tensions starting on dec 7 1991 
the initial crisis is a tad farfetched the president and vice 
president are incapacited by a type of poison gas called blue 
x the gas was set off by parties unknown who used an explosive 
made in sovietbloc countries 
all this occurs just as guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked 
afghan government have knocked out a key air base theyre using 
chemical weapons supplied either by iran or the united states and 
afghan leaders are urgently requesting soviet military help 
soviet officials grappling with this learn of the disabling of 
the us president it leaves both them and the americans facing 
the questions of who is in charge in washington and who attacked 
this nations leader 
if you can accept the wobbly premise of the presidential 
gassing the show becomes a fascinating look at soviet and american 
crisis teams as they handle emergencies that while separate 
affect each nation and could have what diplomats call the gravest 
consequences such as war 
members of each side in abcs version of what official 
washington knows as a crisis avoidance exercise have faced the 
real thing before 
the american team includes adm william crowe retired chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff as head of the us team rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee as 
white house chief of staff and rozanne ridgeway a former 
assistant secretary of state on hand here as a makebelieve deputy 
secretary of state 
with koppel at one point reminding those who may be just tuning 
in that the crisis is an imaginary one the tensions quickly 
rise with wild cards or unexpected developments periodically 
thrown in 
these include a higher state of alert for the navys 6th fleet 
ordered by its commander and an air force kc135 tanker reported 
missing after it refueled an american spy plane near the soviet 
unions eastern coastline 
as the exercise progresses koppel notes that each side despite 
its best intentions is misreading one anothers moves and 
intentions as one can imagine that can easily lead to uhoh 
time for the whole world 
it would be wrong of course to disclose in advance how things 
come out but it can be said that the revelation of who probably is 
responsible for the presidents gassing isnt too believeable 
and despite some mock newscasts and references to press reports 
about the crisis what happens with the press particularly 
american network television in such highstakes confusing times 
isnt fully developed here 
still koppels onehour game show definitely is worth a look 
he has done this sort of thing before and earlier this season 
primetime live also gave it a try that failed but each only 
did it with americans that he now has the soviets in the game is 
remarkable of itself 
sad to say cbs earlier 48 hours report on how the armys 
future officers are being trained at west point is a onehour 
exercise in cursory 
the usual suspects are trotted out women as soldiers 
minorities plebe harassment and whether in the context of the 
current peacetime todays cadets are tomorrows bureacratic 
managers not warriors capable of leading men in combat should the 
balloon go up 
despite a squad of five correspondents and anchor dan rather 
not much comes in the way of insights 
it might have been wiser to use west point as the starting point 
for a show that examines a thought by the schools athletic 
director col jim anderson whose decorations include the combat 
infantrymans badge 
it wont take too many years he says before we wont 
have any activeduty vietnam veterans left and we may in fact 
have an army that has nobody in it that has ever been in combat

the need for new products generally is filled 
quickly in the united states simply because competition is so keen 
that companies cannot afford not to exploit an opportunity 
the oat cereal experience illustrates the point with dozens of 
products appearing magically after consumers indicated that if oats 
were nutritionally good for horses they were good for humans too 
but in two of the most important areas of society the system 
seems to have failed it hasnt been able to market a truly 
lowcost house and it hasnt been able to present a widely 
affordable healthcare package 
both houses and health care continue to rise in price with each 
at one time or another spurting far beyond the level of general 
price inflation each has unique impediments neither seems able to 
benefit from volume production 
in housing it is possible to build a house at an affordable 
price putting it on a piece of property is another matter plagued 
by high land costs and a bureaucracy of zoning environmental 
health and building officials 
builders the trades and engineers probably have done as much as 
they can 
forty years ago the typical price of a new singlefamily home 
was 9500 with labor and materials accounting for nearly 70 
percent of price 
by 1969 the sale price was 26000 and labor and materials were 
down to 55 percent of that in 1989 the typical price had soared 
to 112500 but labor and materials were down to 47 percent 
meanwhile the percentage of price accounted for by the finished 
lot had risen steadily to 21 percent in 1969 from 11 percent in 
1949 intensive use of lots as in cluster housing then restrained 
the percentage but it reached 27 percent last year 
still another factor has added to the problem high interest 
rates have eliminated from the market many wouldbe buyers rates 
are falling again but with debts overhanding the economy there is 
no assurance they wont rise again 
controlling health care costs runs into even more formidable 
barriers the most unmanageable of them involving the question how 
do you restrain spending when human lives are at stake or more 
simply what price human life 
the other problems are barely less awesome 
research saves lives but it cannot be put on an assembly line 
the design and development of medical technology makes more 
diagnostic machinery available each year but at a huge cost 
staffs no longer are willing to work for minimal wages the 
population is aging new diseases such as aids make an 
appearance and insurance and litigation costs have become a new 
and heavy cross to bare 
if current cost trends continue says the conference board 
business research group medical costs could rise to 15 trillion 
by the year 2000 compared with 600 billion in 1989 
wendy gray employee benefits specialist for the conference 
board states that projections for the year 2005 suggests that 
the federal budget for medicare will be greater than for social 
security or defense 
the consequences are almost beyond comprehension 
so threatening are these consequences that government has been 
unable to deal with them business is so appalled that it is 
attempting to cut benefits paid to employees while employees are 
trying seeking more from business 
perhaps you have wondered how the socalled peace dividend 
expected to follow a cooling of the arms race might be spent 
wonder no more if projections are correct rising medical costs 
would devour it in a few months

it was a decade in which the spiraling inflation economic 
stagnation and successive oil shocks of the 1970s were replaced by 
new headaches huge budget and trade deficits and fears the 
united states was becoming a secondrate economic power 
it was the decade when americans went on a spending spree 
financed by foreign capital 
the profligacy meant that the united states the worlds richest 
creditor nation at the start of the 1980s ended up as the largest 
debtor nation facing the threat of declining living standards as 
us wealth moves into foreigners hands to pay the interest 
reaganomics defined in vastly different ways by friend and foe 
dominated the decade ronald reagan campaigned for the presidency 
on a pledge of cutting tax rates boosting defense spending and 
balancing the budget all at the same time 
voodoo economics sniffed george bush reagans competitor 
for the 1980 republican nomination bush was proven correct but in 
winning the presidency in 1988 bush took his own nonewtaxes 
pledge 
he promised to boost spending on education environmental 
cleanup and the war on drugs all without a tax increase he 
promised a balanced budget as well it would be accomplished with 
something called a flexible freeze but bush never got specific 
about which programs he would put on ice 
as a consequence the federal government recorded a 1521 
billion deficit in 1989 bushs first year in office more than 
double the deficit in 1980 jimmy carters last year as president 
the national debt the accumulation of all the past deficits 
had not reached 1 trillion when reagan took office as the decade 
ended the national debt was closing in on 3 trillion reagan had 
piled up more red ink than all of his predecessors put together 
despite that reagan held true to his promise to cut tax rates 
persuading congress to slash the top personal rate from 70 percent 
to 33 percent 
reagan also succeeded in slaying the inflation dragon as the 
decade began the country was in its worst economic predicament 
since the great depression a longsimmering bout of inflation 
fueled by successive oil shocks that had sent consumer prices into 
doubledigit territory climbing by 125 percent in 1980 alone 
paul volcker serving as chairman of the federal reserve board 
used high interest rates to dampen economic growth and whip 
inflation getting support for the task from reagan the medicine 
worked but not before interest rates hit levels not seen since the 
civil war devastating the housing industry and shoving the country 
into the steep 198182 recession 
at its depth 12 million americans were out of work the 
unemployment rate hit 108 percent its highest level since the 
depression and news reports focused nightly on soup lines and 
crowded public shelters 
but the hard times have been followed by 84 months of 
prosperity a period of growth unmatched in peacetime and nearly 
three times longer than the average expansion period 
while growth was slowing as 1989 ended economists held out hope 
that falling interest rates would spur a rebound in economic 
activity in 1990 
despite the long expansion the percentage of americans living 
in poverty refused to budge below 13 percent remaining higher 
throughout the decade than it had been at any time during the 
1970s the gap between the wealthiest americans and the poorest 
also widened to its broadest range in 40 years 
critics blamed the high poverty rate on holes in the safety 
net that david stockman reagans budget director had erected to 
protect the neediest from the pain of government budget cuts 
it wasnt only people on welfare who were squeezed the income 
for a typical american family last year was 32191 which meant 
that even with more twoearner households and a long expansion 
family incomes had only made it back to where they had been in 1973 
democrats attributed the modest income gains to the fact that 
highpaying industrial jobs were being replaced by minimumwage 
jobs in the service sector transforming the country into a 
nation of hamburger flippers 
nonsense said republicans who pointed to the 20 million jobs 
created since the recession ended in 1982 a level of job growth 
that sent unemployment down close to 5 percent the lowest it has 
been since 1973 
the modest wage gains didnt stop americans from going on a 
spending spree the heavy consumer purchases and the huge 
government budget deficits fueled the expansion 
the trouble was that much of the demand was met by foreign 
producers as the countrys trade deficit widened to historic 
levels the broadest measure of us trade was in surplus as the 
decade began deficits in merchandise trade being more than covered 
by americans earnings on their overseas investments 
but a huge surge of imports spurred by a strong dollar pushed 
the current account deficit to a record 154 billion in 1987 with 
only modest improvement since that time 
the billions of dollars flowing into foreign hands came back 
into the united states as a wave of investments in everything from 
highrise office buildings to hollywood movie studios for the 
first time since 1914 us investments overseas were exceeded by 
foreign investments in this country presenting a host of problems 
concerning how the interest owed to foreigners will be paid 
but still economists saw reasons for optimism in the 1990s the 
crumbling of the communist bloc was expected to produce a peace 
dividend of lower defense spending that would help the federal 
government balance its books 
in addition many analysts were looking for the low personal 
savings rates of the 1980s to begin rising in the 1990s as the baby 
boom generation moves into middle age 
a larger pool of savings could spell big dividends for the 
united states lowering the cost of capital and allowing american 
businesses to make the investments in research and modernization 
that will be needed to keep up with the japanese and other global 
competitors

herbert parmet once vowed to help keep richard 
nixon from becoming president stephen ambrose says that in 1974 
all he wanted was to get nixon out of office roger morris was so 
appalled by the invasion of cambodia that he resigned from the 
nixon white house 
now all three have written books on the 37th president and all 
say the experience has increased their respect for nixon even 
though none of the three exonerates him for ethical failings 
i think it was very important to see him as the very 
sensitive intelligent human being that he is parmet a 
historian whose previous books include a definitive work on 
president kennedy said in a telephone interview 
ambrose now at work on an account of the onslaught of criticism 
that drove nixon from office in the watergate era said i cant 
help but have a nolongersecret admiration for his ability to 
stand up to it and fight back 
morris is critical of nixons ethics but says his book is an 
evenhanded portrait 
parmet a professor of history at queensborough community 
college in new york worked six years on his onevolume biography 
richard nixon and his america scheduled for publication jan 
15 by little brown 
ambrose a historian who teaches at the university of new 
orleans is writing the final volume of a threevolume biography 
the second volume the triumph of a politician was published 
recently by simon and schuster 
morris who has forged a reputation as an investigative 
journalist since quitting the national security council staff in 
1970 recently completed the first of a projected three volumes 
richard milhous nixon the rise of an american politician 
published by henry holt and co 
thus with four living expresidents on the scene for the first 
time in more than a century the one who is getting the lions 
share of the attention is the one who was driven from office nixon 
resigned on aug 9 1974 after revelations stemming from a botched 
burglary at democratic headquarters during his 1972 reelection 
campaign 
nixon himself is putting finishing touches on the seventh book 
he has written since his resignation in the arena a memoir of 
victory defeat and renewal is scheduled for midapril 
publication by simon and schuster 
nixons spokesman john taylor said he does not believe the 
former president has read any of the books about him nixon said in 
a television interview last year that he never does 
nixon granted five interviews to parmet but declined to be 
interviewed by ambrose or morris morris who has written critical 
books about henry kissinger and alexander haig both top white 
house aides in the nixon years said i am sure he regarded me as 
a critic and as an adversary 
taylor said parmet was recommended to nixon by mutual friends 
and the former president was aware of his high ranking in the 
scholarly community 
parmet a democrat whose works include jfk the presidency of 
john f kennedy said he thinks it was the interviews more than 
anything that burnished his view of nixon 
i for one as many americans grew up with a view of nixon 
that was really based on a herblock caricature he said the 
heavyjowled stubbly and glowering figure portrayed by the 
washington post editorial cartoonist was an unmitigated force of 
evil parmet said 
i promised my daughter once that he would never become 
president she still holds that against me the historian said 
i feel that i have gotten to understand nixon based on the 
research i have done and probably more emphatically on the 
onetoone personal encounters he said i began to see the 
basis for how he felt himself in a constant underdog role 
this has nothing to do or very little to do with policy it 
has a great deal to do with the understanding of the man 
understanding does not necessarily lead to approval but it does 
help me to see things from his perspective and i think thats very 
important 
after he finished the book parmet said he turned to his editor 
at little brown ray roberts and asked do you think this is 
sympathetic to nixon or hostile 
roberts said it was sympathetic parmet recalled 
ambrose who wrote an admiring twovolume biography of dwight 
eisenhower before taking on nixon said his revised estimate of the 
first us president to resign from office stemmed from the fact 
he is not in active politics anymore and i am trying to look at him 
as a historian rather than as a citizen 
i am giving the devil his due he said 
he interviewed former nixon aides including sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny and new york times columnist william safire and 
found they really like the guy and admire him 
i just had to rethink my own feelings about nixon in the light 
of what people whose opinion i respect felt about him he said 
and then im working right now on the year 1974 and i must 
say that nixon in adversity is more likable and more admirable than 
nixon in triumph now that doesnt mean that i have suddenly 
decided that he was innocent by no means in fact i think i 
probably know as much as anybody except nixon himself about how 
guilty he was 
also i hadnt paid any attention in 74 to what nixon was 
doing other than watergate all i wanted was to get him out of 
office 
after taking another look at nixons proposals on arms control 
welfare reform federal aid to education and health care he said 
i just have to groan at what we lost when he resigned 
morris said his research gave me a great deal of added respect 
for how good a politician he was i think as a young man he was 
quite superb and would be good today 
but his studies did not soften morris view of nixons 
california campaigns against rep jerry voorhis for the house in 
1946 and helen gahagan douglas for the senate in 1950 often 
criticized for redbaiting and character assassination 
if anything the critics did not know the half he said 
those campaigns were worse than even the critics thought 
he was a meticulous painstaking thorough often brilliant 
very well organized beautifully timed politician said morris 
that doesnt say anything at all about his values it doesnt 
have anything to do with the compromise of his integrity or dirty 
money or the honesty of his campaigning 
yet morris a democrat when he first met nixon and went to work 
for him said i think we ended up writing a very empathetic and 
evenhanded book about him and especially about his family it is a 
book i wouldnt hesitate to show to his mother or father if they 
were still alive

steel importers say fairtrade laws are being 
abused to protect us steel companies from foreign competition and 
urged an international trading body to examine the issue 
the importers pinned their criticism monday on antidumping 
laws which are intended to prevent foreign companies from selling 
in the united states at unfairly low prices 
foreign producers can run afoul of antidumping laws through no 
fault of their own simply because of a drop in the value of the 
dollar the american institute for imported steel said at a new 
york news conference 
a consultant for the trade group said in an interview that 
commerce department officials had admitted to him that they 
selectively prosecuted foreign companies under antidumping laws as 
a warning to others 
they were actually proud of using the laws somewhat unevenly 
just to keep the foreign producers on their toes said hans 
mueller an economics professor at middle tennessee state 
university 
a commerce department spokeswoman said she could not immediately 
comment on the professors statement 
the trade group said us antidumping laws should be reviewed 
by the current uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade a multinational set of freetrade talks 
the steel importers said they were pleased with the bush 
administrations commitment to freetrade principles and hoped it 
would back the drive for changes in antidumping laws 
the bush administration lobbied against heavy restraints on 
imported steel and succeeded in holding the renewal this fall to 2 
years instead of five as us steel makers had requested foreign 
countries that eliminate subsidies will be given raises in their 
quotas 
in addition to importing steel members of the trade group also 
export some americanmade steel the institute said it supports the 
bush administrations commitment to worldwide elimination of 
subsidies reduction of tariffs and elimination of nontariff 
barriers

american companies must move quickly to take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by soviet perestroika during 
the coming years or fall further behind foreign competitors says 
the chairman of pepsico inc 
if you want to go you better get there now because if you 
wait someone else will have the business don kendall told 
american executives attending a ussoviet business symposium 
monday 
kendall was one of several american and soviet speakers at the 
symposium produced by business week magazine called the opening 
of the soviet market implications for global business 
dennis sokol chairman of medical services partners inc and 
president of a sovietamerican medical consortium said that of the 
approximately 1000 joint ventures created in the past year between 
soviet and foreign companies fewer than 100 involve american 
companies 
kendall whose softdrink company in 1972 produced the first 
american consumer product sold in the soviet union said that even 
in the era of perestroika the political and economic 
restructuring proposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
there are big obstacles for us businesses 
among them are the difficulty of doing business in a 
cashstarved nation where profits cannot easily be taken out of the 
country full convertibility of the ruble the main hindrance to 
us companies doing business in the soviet union could take 
longer than a decade kendall said 
you need to start by acknowledging that soviet change will 
take time lots of time he said 
conference participants learned firsthand of the problems faced 
in conducting business between the two nations members of a 
soviet delegation did not attend because visas were not issued on 
time 
kendall praised the weekend summit in malta between president 
bush and gorbachev as a step toward helping perestroika succeed 
but urged the united states to loosen trade restrictions that now 
hinder ussoviet commerce 
he also called for most favored nation status for the soviet 
union which would lower tariffs on us imports from the soviets 
and for dropping conditions for granting the soviets observer 
status at the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
sokol said the most serious problem facing us companies in 
entering the soviet union was the lack of hard currency 
nevertheless joint venture opportunities abound in many areas 
such as the medical supply field where acute shortages exist he 
said soviet medical supply companies currently are able to meet 
only 65 percent of demand sokol said 
soviet officials who did attend the symposium outlined a series 
of problems facing their nation as it carries out perestroika 
including massive economic reforms 
vladamir checklin head of the soviet trade and economic 
council compared the current struggle between the old centralized 
economic system and the emerging reforms with that of a patient 
undergoing psychiatric treatment 
as the therapy starts it brings out a lot of serious 
diseases he said the first step to perestroika checklin said 
is that its our problem we have to do it ourselves 
among the changes needed for the soviets to compete in the 
global economy he said is a reorientation of the manufacturing 
sector 
we havent manufactured in the soviet union for western 
markets he said we need to change in order to compete 
checklin also said a number of proposals would be taken up by 
the new soviet congress to further the reforms including revising 
tax policies and privatization of unprofitable businesses 
the proof of the pudding is in the eating and many more us 
companies are liking this pudding he said

international business machines corp called a 
meeting for stock analysts amid speculation that the company was 
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility 
closings 
ibm declined to comment on the substance of the meeting 
scheduled for today but a spokesman indicated it would be important 
ibm has a 40year tradition of no layoffs and a senior ibm 
executive last week confirmed that the computer company would stick 
to that however if the company closed an operation such as a 
plant office or distribution center many employees might choose 
to quit rather than accept a transfer to a distant location 
bob djurdjevic president of annex research inc in phoenix 
predicted ibm might announce plans to eliminate about 20000 jobs 
paying for the streamlining program with a charge of perhaps more 
than 1 billion against fourthquarter earnings 
ibm has been competing with a layer of fat around the waist 
for too long djurdjevic said he said he thought trimming of 
sales forces was more likely than facility closings 
ibm normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives 
to employees to quit or take early retirement earlier this year 
the company began its third such program in three years hoping to 
trim 600 to 1000 manufacturing jobs 
ibms stock rose 212 a share to 9925 monday on the new york 
stock exchange the stock peaked at 17587 in august 1987

to terminate its agreement with lin on combining the cellular phone 
operations of the two companies 
spokeswoman carlton horton in atlanta said bellsouth was 
studying the request but did not expect to have any immediate 
comment on it 
geoffrey johnson who follows the telecommunications industry 
for argus research corp said bellsouth could come back with a 
revision of its offer 
this doesnt mean the bellsouth deal is dead he said i 
would be fairly amazed if bellsouth walks away from this 
lin a new yorkbased cellular telephone broadcasting and 
publishing concern had resisted mccaws overtures since september 
when lin reached an agreement with bellsouth on combining their 
cellular interests 
but lin said monday that mccaw submitted a revised buyout offer 
friday and the two sides conducted negotiations on it over the 
weekend 
lin said bellsouth was invited to revise their cellular merger 
agreement but said the regional telephone company has not done 
so at this time 
it said it could not enter a binding agreement with mccaw as 
long as the merger agreement with bellsouth remains in effect 
the kirkland washbased mccaw is the largest us cellular 
telephone company with nearly 50 million potential customers but 
it is seeking access to bigger markets in an effort to create a 
national cellular network 
the combined lin and bellsouth cellular interests would have had 
about 55 million potential customers while a mccawlin company 
would have 70 million including customers in five of the top 10 
markets 
throughout this long process our goal has has been to 
maximize stockholder value donald a pels lins president and 
chief executive said in a statement the boards action in 
recommending the revised mccaw offer is in accordance with that 
goal 
the boards recommendation was announced after the stock market 
closed 
in national overthecounter trading lin rose 150 a share to 
close at 12162 while mccaw gained 75 cents a share to 3925 
bellsouth rose 37 cents a share to 54 in trading on the new york 
stock exchange 
under the new proposal mccaw offered to buy 219 million shares 
of lin at 15411 per share with the 51 million lin shares that 
mccaw now owns that would give mccaw just over 50 percent of lins 
539 million common shares 
previously mccaw offered to buy 225 million shares of lin at 
150 per share 
while each cash offer was worth 338 billion mccaw said in the 
revised proposal it would give lin its nearly 5 percent interest in 
a los angeles cellular franchise after the tender offer 
as in the earlier offer mccaw also would have lin buy 425 
million of mccaw stock and distribute it to lin stockholders other 
than mccaw 
under its agreement with bellsouth lin shareholders would get a 
cash dividend of 42 a share a 50 percent stake in the new 
cellular company and stock in a new company that would consist of 
lins seven television stations 
argus johnson said he estimated the value of the mccaw offer at 
about 131 a share up from 12750 a share under its previous 
offer due to inclusion of the los angeles cellular interest he 
valued the bellsouth offer at 124 a share 
the terms of their agreement to merge cellular operations would 
give bellsouth 54 million plus expenses if the agreement is 
terminated 
lin had turned to bellsouth in september coming up with the 
plan to merge cellular interests after talks with mccaw broke down 
mccaw began its pursuit of lin in early june 
in mondays announcement lin noted that as long as the 
bellsouth merger agreement continues in effect it cannot enter 
into a binding agreement covering the new mccaw proposal 
it added however that mccaw is irrevocably committed until 
feb 28 1990 to enter into a binding agreement with lin as long 
as lins board continues to recommend the mccaw transaction 
if bellsouth does not terminate the merger agreement lin could 
do so if lin shareholders fail to approve it at a jan 12 
stockholders meeting called to consider the bellsouth deal

transportation secretary samuel skinner says 
exxon spent 19 billion cleaning up its alaskan oil spill 
skinner repeating his high praise for exxons cleanup of the 
march 24 spill characterized the amount as an unbelievable 
number 
but exxon spokesman perry smith in alaska said the company has 
only claimed over 1 billion in spending on the spill les 
rogers a spokesman at exxon central district headquarters in 
houston texas said he knew of no other cost figure 
skinner whose department includes the coast guard has overseen 
government response to the spill he said the full story of exxons 
efforts after the exxon valdez ran aground in march in prince 
william sound has not been told 
the ship spilled more than 10 million gallons of alaskan crude 
oil that spread over a many miles of scenic coastland 
the last number i heard from exxon corp is that they have 
spent 1 billion 900 million in their cleanup effort since the 
accident skinner said 
it should never have happened but at least a very 
substantial goodfaith effort has been made to clean up that 
spill he said 
smith said exxons expenses include over a billion dollars 
including 160 million in claims paid to fishermen and others who 
said they were harmed by the spill 
smith said no other breakdown of company spending was available 
he said expenses would include salaries for cleanup crews 
reimbursements to the coast guard for its work equipment expenses 
and fees for scientists and consultants 
skinner said nature is expected to contribute to the cleansing 
of shorelines this winter 
next spring well go up there and decide what remains to be 
done and theyre committed to do whatever needs to be done he 
said adding he expected the need to be considerably less than last 
year 
smith speaking for exxon said the company would wait to see 
what the coast guard determines needs to be done in the spring 
and well respond to them 
he said exxons response contrasted with operations after other 
oil spills throughout the world where no effort close to that was 
undertaken 
environmentalists have been critical of the cleanup effort 
accusing the administration of letting the company off the hook 
without examining longterm damage 
the state of alaska is suing exxon accusing it of negligence in 
both the spill and the cleanup exxon has filed a countersuit 
alleging the state hindered the cleanup by opposing the use of 
oildispersing chemicals 
the exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood faces trial jan 22 
on three felony counts of criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil exxon fired hazelwood after the spill

a government proposal to curb the widely used 
pesticide ebdc is prompting little enthusiasm among 
environmentalists who say it doesnt go far enough while the 
industry is warning that consumers will have to pay more for poorer 
quality fruits and vegetables 
the environmental protection agency proposed monday to halt the 
use of ebdcs on 45 food products including tomatoes potatoes 
bananas and lettuce 
the family of pesticides which has been linked to cancer has 
been used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew 
the proposed restrictions would eliminate about 80 percent to 90 
percent of the 18 million pounds of ebdcs used by american farmers 
but environmentalists complained the curbs would not go into effect 
until early 1991 and would not cover 10 crops including grapes 
onions and cranberries 
the epa appears unwilling to act swiftly and aggressively 
said janet hathaway a lawyer for the natural resources defense 
council the environmental group that earlier this year spawned a 
consumer uproar by campaigning against the use of the 
cancercausing chemical alar on apples 
even if epa does what it is proposing the total risks from 
legal uses of ebdcs is likely to be comparable to the cancer threat 
posed by alar she said 
the epa announcement also prompted a rebuke from some members of 
congress 
tentative half steps will not do when what we need is a 
wholesale reform of our pesticide laws it will take years before 
these pesticides will finally be taken off the market said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee 
sen joseph lieberman dconn said he was troubled that 
widespread ebdc use would continue for nearly two years as the epa 
goes through its regulatory procedures and he questioned whether 
substitute chemicals will be safer 
laboratory tests have shown an ebdc byproduct called etu causes 
cancer in animals and likely causes cancer in human if lifelong 
exposure is significant 
chronic exposure to ebdcs also raises the risks of birth defects 
or thyroid disorders health experts say 
manufacturers of ebdcs have said they plan to halt its use on 42 
food products at the end of this year accounting for about 40 
percent to 50 percent of the ebdcs sold annually 
but epa administrator william reilly said monday that the 
industry action does not go far enough and that the fungicide also 
should be prohibited on three other crops tomatoes potatoes and 
bananas which together account for nearly onethird of the ebdcs 
used 
while ebdcs for the most part do not pose a health threat on 
individual food crops they are so widely used the cumulative 
risks has been determined to be unreasonable the agency said 
the epa estimated the maximum risk of someone getting cancer 
from a lifetime of exposure to ebdcs would be reduced to 3 in 1 
million under the proposed curbs compared with 4 in 10000 under 
the chemicals current widespread use and a chance of 1 in 100000 
under the voluntary rollback of ebdc use already proposed by the 
manufacturers 
but a produce industry group the center for produce quality 
called ebdcs essential for growing crops and warned that decreased 
use of the fungicide will mean higher produce prices and poorer 
quality 
some alternative fungicides do exist and are approved for some 
crops but in many instances they are significantly less effective 
or much more expensive than ebdcs said john mcclung of the 
united fresh fruit and vegetable association 
the produce industry has argued the epa risk estimates are too 
high because they reflect residues found in tests in the field and 
not in stores ebdc residues can easily wash off or decay with 
time said john gardiner an official of du pont co one of the 
major ebdc manufacturers 
he said preliminary results from marketbasket surveys indicate 
much lower residue levels than the field tests 
environmentalists argue ebdcs are often present with other 
cancercausing pesticides on fruit and vegetables and studies 
should take into account the cumulative effect 
by conservative estimates said jay feldman of the national 
coalition against the misuse of pesticides there are 12 cancer 
causing pesticides on apples 10 on tomatoes 13 on potatoes three 
on bananas and 11 on citrus fruits 
under the epa proposal ebdcs would continue to be used on 
grapes wheat cranberries onions sugar beets sweet corn 
peanuts almonds asparagus and figs 
the 45 other crops on which ebdcs are used are 
apples apricots bananas barley casaba melons crenshaw 
melons cucumbers eggplants endives lettuce potatoes 
pineapples pumpkins green and dried beans lima beans broccoli 
brussel sprouts cabbage cantaloupes carrots cauliflower 
celery collards field corn cotton crab apples fennel honeydew 
melons kale kohlrabi mustard greens nectarines oats papayas 
peaches pears pecans peppers rhubarb rye squash spinach 
tomatoes turnips and watermelon

the economic incentives president bush 
proposed in malta will allow soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to claim an important symbolic victory but they will do little to 
help gorbachev rescue his ailing economy say us experts on the 
soviet union 
those analysts said they viewed bushs weekend summit proposals 
as an important first step in integrating the soviets into the 
global economic system 
but they cautioned against looking for any big immediate payoff 
in terms of expanding soviet trade or boosting soviet living 
standards 
the soviet economy is in very bad shape the question is 
will this rouse that economy i am skeptical said marshall 
goldman a harvard professor and leading expert on the soviet union 
the situaion is deteriorating in the soviet union he said 
you have got to turn around and show concrete results that will 
end up on the table and that is just not happening 
in many ways the soviet economy is facing more dire problems 
now than before gorbachev launched his perestroika 
restructuring reforms with winter approaching the country is 
plagued by strikes and severe shortages of many consumer items 
bushs economic proposals include 
immediate start to negotiating a ussoviet trade agreement 
with a goal of completion by junes planned summit in washington 
between the two leaders that would also be the target for lifting 
the 15yearold high tariffs on soviet goods imposed under the 
jacksonvanik amendment that penalized the soviets for their 
restrictive emigration policies 
us support for granting the soviets observer status in the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the 97country organization 
that regulates world trade the united states had previously 
opposed soviet requests for observer status in gatt arguing that 
the soviet system was incompatible with gatts freetrade 
principles 
recommendations that congress lift a ban on providing trade 
credits to the soviet union through the us exportimport bank 
negotiations leading to a ussoviet treaty that would 
facilitate us investments in the soviet union 
while the proposals announced in malta appear modest economists 
said they allowed gorbachev to return to his own country with 
symbolic victories showing concrete evidence of the bush 
administrations support for perestroika 
this is a foot in the door for the soviet union said howard 
wachtel an economics professor at american university it sets 
in motion a train of activity which had largely been cut off by 
stalin when he opted not to participate in western economic 
organizations after world war ii 
in addition to observer status in gatt the soviets are 
considering seeking admission to the international monetary fund 
and the world bank admission in those organizations still 
considered to be far in the future would open up a substantial 
borrowing pool the soviets could tap to support their economy 
bush seemed to be seeking to play down expectations for 
immediate payoffs 
in a news conference monday in brussels bush said the chances 
gorbachev would be allowed to participate in next years economic 
summit with the wests seven leading industrial countries were 
slim and none 
but bush said his initiatives would help provide the soviets 
with important expertise on how marketbased economies work 
dwayne o andreas chief executive of the agricultural giant 
archerdanielsmidland co of decatur ill said the lifting of 
the high tariffs on soviet products would allow the soviets to sell 
more goods here and should foster reciprocal actions by the soviets 
to purchase more american goods particularly agricultural products 
unleashing the forces of freeenterprise in the soviet union 
cant be anything but beneficial to prospects for world peace 
andreas said 
us sales to the soviet union have totaled 322 billion so far 
this year primarily in agricultural products while soviet sales 
in this country total 555 million 
economists said the summit agreements were not likely to boost 
that total quickly although they saw opportunities for increasing 
sales of such consumer items as vodka and soviet furs 
the soviets dont have the money to buy a lot more in terms of 
imports and they dont have all that much to export said david 
wyss chief financial economist for drimcgraw hill 
but allen sinai chief economist at the boston co said it 
would be wrong to judge the malta summit a failure if it does not 
produce quick economic results 
malta is a longrun affair with all kinds of great promise 
he said one should be cautious but there are great hopes and 
optimism that a new era is dawning

estonians soon will be saying the 
equivalent of charge it as the tiny republic begins a venture 
into plastic money that could lead to widespread use of credit 
cards in the soviet union 
estonias deputy prime minister viktor rajevski outlined a 
threestep plan monday that would bring visa cards to estonia 
starting next year then to the other baltic republics latvia and 
lithuania and finally to other soviet republics 
launching plastic money is like a new philosophy in the soviet 
union rajevksi said through an interpreter in an interview 
during a visit with officials at visa international headquarters 
mr gorbachev has supported the economic events in estonia in his 
speeches several times 
estonia the smallest of the baltic states with a population of 
16 million is in the northwestern corner of the soviet union near 
finland its language is similar to finnish rajevski described the 
republic as a window to the west 
he said he envisions estonia as a financial and commercial 
center in eastern europe with its banks issuing visa cards for 
other republics estonia already has three free economic zones and 
was the first soviet republic to establish the principle of a 
selffunding economy 
toby mitchell of visa international in london said it was the 
first time visa had worked with a soviet government to develop a 
bank card program 
the first visa card in the soviet union was issued in july 1988 
through intourist the commercial organization of the soviet state 
committee for foreign travel only a few thousand cards have since 
been issued throughout the country 
its important for visa to work with an entire economic unit 
in the soviet union in providing a total regional payment 
solution mitchell said it gets us far deeper into the banking 
system 
estonia is attractive to visa mitchell said because it is the 
most economically developed of the soviet republics only 50 miles 
from helsinki finland estonia culturally is more western than 
other soviet states he said it is more likely to develop 
western products and practices quickly 
and it is sufficiently small so that it provides an ideal 
testbed for the implementation of national card systems 
elsewhere he said you can work with a million card program 
whereas if youd try any of the larger republics the numbers start 
getting beyond any easy control 
estonia has a tradition of testing economic reforms in the 
soviet union and mitchell said it will be a long time before the 
whole soviet union adopts sophisticated banking systems 
the difference in cultures the difference in economic and 
social structures between the central asian republics and baltic 
republics is enormous but we hope that estonia will provide the 
model mitchell said 
under the plan any estonian with an income regardless of age 
or whether he or she is a student or retired will be issued a visa 
card 
the cards will be used primarily as debit or payment cards as 
they are throughout most of europe rather than as credit cards as 
they are in the united states money will be debited from 
cardholder accounts as soon as purchases are made but if the 
accounts are overdrawn credit will be granted with interest for 
three months 
estonians and others in the soviet union have large amounts of 
savings because of the inadequacy of available consumer goods 
rajevski said officials hope that as more goods are made available 
through economic reforms use of the visa cards instead of cash 
will make it easier for officials to regulate currency and avoid 
devaluations

business opportunities he said 
institutional investors also were buying in efforts to wrap up 
the year with increased profits he added 
some investors were selling to take profits because of concern 
over the speed of the indexs rise but this was more than offset

supervision the agency created as part of the sampl bailout package 
passed by congress this year 
wall 50 a former top aide to republican sen jake garn of 
utah won the job as top cop of the troubled thrift industry 2 
years ago because of his political skills and backing 
he blamed his downfall on politics as well particularly those 
of the house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas 
the simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the 
blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join in 
the hue and cry raised by the house banking committee chairman for 
my departure from office wall said in his resignation letter to 
president bush 
many had wondered why m danny wall the m stands for melvin 
wanted the job in the first place it was no easy assignment 
regulating 3100 savings and loans at a time when bad investments 
had left many institutions broke and more at the brink of 
insolvency 
i like a challenge was the stock response from wall a 
balding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a penchant for 
threepiece suits 
those who knew him said wall sought the job because he wanted to 
leave the shadows of capitol hill for a command of his own 
the trouble is its difficult to come out smelling well when 
you command a garbage scow said kenneth guenther executive vice 
president of the independent bankers association of america 
walls career in public service dates back 27 years to fargo 
nd where in 1962 he managed two department of housing and urban 
development projects he went on to a hudrelated post in salt lake 
city where he met garn soon to be the citys mayor 
garn came to the senate in 1975 wall came with him and rose to 
be his top aide when republicans took control of the senate in 
1981 garn became banking committee chairman wall its staff 
director in 1982 they pushed through congress legislation 
deregulating savings institutions 
when the democrats regained control of the senate after the 1986 
elections wall began lobbying to replace edwin gray as head of the 
federal home loan bank board the forerunner of the office of 
thrift supervision 
the white house was looking for someone with the political 
skills to deal with congress as evidence of massive financial 
problems in the savings and loan industry grew 
wall with garns backing got the nomination and won easy 
bipartisan support 
initial reaction was favorable wall won plaudits for being 
accessible a style symbolized by his decision to leave open the 
heavy glass door to his office 
if somebody wants to talk to me im going to listen to 
them he said recently you cant close your door to your 
constituents 
but the honeymoon was short 
as the industrys problems mounted time and time again wall was 
forced to increase his estimate of the scope of the debacle 
damaging his credibility in congress 
critics said walls strengths on capitol hill where compromise 
is the norm were weaknesses at the bank board 
you have to be a really tough person and you have to be 
willing to sit down with a guy eyeball to eyeball and say im 
going to take your business away from you said bert ely a 
banking analyst who repeatedly has criticized wall i dont think 
danny had that in him 
still others said his ties to the senate left him vulnerable to 
political pressure particularly in the case of lincoln whose 
owner charles keating enlisted a handful of senators to help him 
lobby regulators 
wall denied those allegations to the end telling bush that 
neither political influence nor lincolns charles keating 
affected my decision on lincoln nor for that matter have i ever 
made decisions for political reasons 
but he said the congressional scrutiny of his actions was 
distracting his staff from their mission revitalizing the 
thrift industry 
as a child m danny wall said he was raised not to run from a 
fight but he decided it was time to walk away telling bush 
i am not willing to stand and fight at the expense of the 
goals of your administration i am not going to be a party to 
such a handicap

the latest victim of the turbulent junk 
bond market may be the 225 million leveraged buyout of michaels 
stores inc analysts said 
to me it looks like it is a dead deal dick edelman a 
southwest securities inc analyst said monday 
an investor group led by fort worth millionaire robert bass 
failed to raise the bond financing needed to take michaels stores 
private the specialty retailer announced friday 
despite a willingness by store management and the bass group 
msi holdings to complete the deal analysts said it was unlikely 
that the 150 million in junk bond and bank financing could be 
arranged before the dec 31 expiration of the agreement it was 
also unclear whether either side would extend the deadline 
the deal is technically dead at the end of the month said 
michaels president bb tuley regarding completion of the deal he 
said i cant say if i am optimistic or pessimistic 
an extension of the agreement would depend on sales during the 
fourth quarter which includes the christmas rush tuley said 
fourth quarter sales comprise 40 percent of the companys revenue 
and 60 percent to 70 percent of its operating profits annually 
msi holdings which offered investors 950 per share in cash 
and 250 per share in preferred stock is controlled by merchant 
banker grauer amp wheat investments and a bass entity acadia 
partners lp american express and equitable life assurance society 
are two of acadias partners 
the investor group says it will continue to seek financing 
through drexel burnham lambert inc of new york 
dennis telzrow an analyst at eppler guerin amp turner inc said 
the proposed buyout would heavily leverage the company which may 
be one reason why the michaels deal is being viewed skeptically by 
the market 
we felt the financing was questionable because of the cash 
flow coverage telzrow said under the 225 million buyout the 
companys debt to equity ratio would climb from 2to1 to about 
4or 5to1 
about 75 million of the 150 million in debt would be junk 
bonds with the rest either bank financing or senior debt said 
peter grauer cochairman of grauer amp wheat investments a 
financing commitment has already been obtained from wells fargo amp 
co in san francisco 
a home decoration and arts and crafts retailer michaels 
operates 121 stores in 17 states

the white house said today it has begun 
searching for a replacement for the embattled m danny wall as the 
nations top savings and loan regulator but that the post would not 
be filled until january 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater commented a day after 
wall announced in a letter to president bush that he was quitting a 
job he said amounted to a thankless and perhaps impossible 
task he said he was leaving to spare his office of thrift 
supervision the disruption that would be caused by continuing his 
fight for political survival with congress 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
was conferring on the vacancy with treasury secretary nicholas 
brady to whom wall reported michael boskin the chairman of the 
council of economic advisers and members of congress 
since congress is in recess it will be january before a new 
director is in place fitzwater said 
wall set no date for his departure saying he would stay on for 
a transition period he said he was looking forward to a job out of 
government but had no specific position in mind 
early speculation on walls successor centered on three 
experienced regulators according to an industry source they are 
richard f syron president of the federal reserve bank of 
boston and a former president of the federal home loan bank of 
boston 
william h roelle a longtime official of the federal deposit 
insurance corp in charge of sampl rescue deals at the resolution 
trust corp 
william taylor a senior regulatory official at the federal 
reserve board serving as an adviser to the administration board 
that oversees the rtc 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said although 
all three men were well regarded by treasury department officials 
who oversee walls agency other candidates also could surface 
until thanksgiving the house banking committee was holding 
weekly hearings spotlighting walls failure to contain what could 
become the nations largest sampl failure the regulator was spending 
much of his time responding to his critics 
most recently wall has come under fire for his handling of 
lincoln savings and loan association an irvine calif thrift 
whose failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to 25 billion 
house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas the 
first to call for walls ouster faulted the regulator for 
rejecting a may 1987 recommendation from federal examiners in san 
francisco that lincoln be seized 
wall said examiners had not produced the evidence needed to 
legally justify the seizure which occurred in april at a packed 
news conference wall said if he had it to do over again he might 
have ordered the seizure and let the courts take the blame for 
blocking it 
it may indeed have been a nowin situation he said 
even before gonzalez began probing the lincoln case wall 
endured grueling congressional criticism for what proved to be 
grossly low estimates of the size of the sampl crisis and for a rash 
of sampl bailout deals in december 1988 driven by expiring tax 
benefits 
however he is generally given credit for raising morale at his 
agency and rebuilding its depleted ranks of examiners 
wall was wrong but not corrupt according to rep jim 
leach riowa a member of the banking panel 
rep bruce vento dminn also a member of the committee said 
wall put politics first and good public policy second and used 
excessively bad judgment 
gonzalez called for walls resignation in a letter to bush in 
october in recent weeks the committee chairman was joined by 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine three 
taxpayeradvocacy groups and several major newspapers 
neither brady nor bush defended wall in public and according to 
government sources white house counsel c boyden gray was pushing 
for his ouster 
wall however said this has been completely at my 
initiative and passed up several opportunities to criticize the 
administration for lack of support he said no one at the white 
house asked him to leave 
the regulator said he had offered to leave office last january 
but the administration which then was drafting proposed sampl 
bailout legislation wanted him to serve out his term through june 
30 1991 
wall reserved his most bitter remarks for gonzalez accusing the 
committee chairman of orchestrating simplistic efforts to find a 
scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis he 
said gonzalez resorted to corruption of the truth and abandonment 
of our historical devotion to fair play 
gonzalezs committee heard from wall for 10 hours in late 
november but only after the committee had already conducted five 
allday sessions to hear from the agencys critics the regulator 
attacked what he called the deliberately lopsided presentation 
during the hearings

once a popular way of saving for the holidays todays 
christmas clubs have gone the way of the onehorse open sleigh 
in the sophisticated world of investments 
the prevalence of savings products with more generous yields and 
widespread reliance on credit cards have dampened many depositors 
desires to open up these traditional accounts 
many banks and thrifts also have stopped offering christmas 
clubs because theyve become too costly to maintain while those 
that still offer them no longer advertise to promote the service 
between 55 percent and 60 percent of the nations credit unions 
though still offer holiday clubs 
we like to say that theyre a fully matured product said 
richard arnold national sales manager at christmas club a corp 
which created the concept in 1910 when a carlisle pa bank 
organized a holiday savings program for schoolchildren 
even the easton pa company which still markets club coupon 
booklets to about 5000 financial institutions nationwide has been 
shifting away from its namesake printing everything from 
taxcollection booklets for state governments to billpayment 
booklets for cable television 
an estimated 23 million americans hold some type of holiday 
savings account a number that has held relatively steady for a 
number of years according to christmas club a corp the average 
annual savings total runs between 300 and 400 
christmas clubs generally attract customers who cant afford 
savings accounts that may require a minimum balance or who need 
the discipline of a forced savings plan many banks see holiday 
accounts more as a service to their customer than a money maker 
these clubs usually start in the fall just as the holiday 
season is about to begin and when many consumers realize they 
should have saved more for gifts and are aimed at accumulating 
money for the following christmas clubs typically permit weekly 
deposits of as little as 5 although there are no fees early 
withdrawal or failure to meet the deposit schedule may result in 
interest penalties 
many banks have dropped coupon payment books long associated 
with these accounts in favor of less costly electronic fund 
transfers which take an automatic deduction from checking or 
savings 
either way the returns on holiday clubs may conjure up more 
images of scrooge than santa claus 
some institutions dont even provide interest offering instead 
a stuffed animal christmas tree ornament or other premium when an 
account is opened 
for clubs that do pay interest yields run slightly lower or 
about the same as those on passbook savings accounts which average 
517 percent nationwide or statement savings accounts which 
average 522 percent according to bank rate monitor a north palm 
beach flabased newsletter credit unions often pay slightly 
higher rates on holiday club accounts than do banks and thrifts 
but a more sophisticated investor with the selfdiscipline to 
regularly put away money rather than running up credit card 
balances can do better elsewhere 
a 1000 annual deposit in a christmas club would yield an 
average 5170 the same 1000 invested in a oneyear certificate 
of deposit yielding 812 percent simple interest would earn 8120 
according to bank rate monitor 
bank deregulation which marks its seventh anniversary 
wednesday helped make christmas clubs less attractive because it 
enabled financial institutions to offer more competitive higher 
yields on a wider variety of investment products such as cds or 
money market accounts 
before deregulation when all banks and thrifts paid the 
same rates on passbook accounts christmas clubs were annual 
reinventions of the wheel said robert k heady bank rate 
monitors publisher today santa is almost absent from bank 
ads 
at chemical bank in new york where only 1000 of its depositors 
have holiday club accounts some branches dont even mention that 
christmas clubs are available 
there are certain branches where its much more popular than 
others and those people will put up a very modest sign saying 
yes we have holiday clubs said susan mcloughlin assistant 
vice president of chemicals deposit products group 
a recent study for christmas club a corp indicated a majority 
of the holiday club savers kept up their accounts almost out of 
routine or else loyalty to their banks 
nearly half of those surveyed said they wouldnt search for 
another financial institution to open a christmas club account if 
theirs discontinued them

banks offered interest rates as 
high as 37 percent a month about seven times the rate of 
inflation as the government tried tuesday to prop up the austral 
argentinas battered currency 
nevertheless the dollar rose against the austral at the close 
of the business day foreign exchange houses offered dollars for 
995 australs apiece about 7 percent higher than the opening rate 
of 9301 
the official rate set last july 9 and supposedly in effect 
until next march is 6551 president carlos menem economy 
minister nestor rapanelli and central bank president egidio 
iannella have insisted there will be no formal devaluation because 
it would aggravate the countrys inflation problem 
the cost of living increase for november is projected at about 5 
percent a tremendous improvement over the 197 percent increase 
last july when menem took office however the government had 
anticipated an increase of only about 2 percent 
the failure to meet that economic target and others including a 
major reduction in state spending and small wage increases to 
organized labor is cited by analysts for the monthlong runup of 
the dollar 
the gap between the official and black market australs has been 
50 percent or higher for nearly a week that gap prompted central 
bank officials to raise interest rates which theoretically makes 
australs more attractive to investors and raises their value 
against the dollar 
top government officials continue to insist there is no reason 
for the australs de facto devaluation and that they will not sell 
currency reserves as former president raul alfonsin did last year 
when confronted with a similar situation to drive down the dollar 
merchants who often view the dollar as a barometer of future 
inflation or political uncertainty publicly have been urged not to 
raise prices in an effort to maintain the value of their products 
in dollar terms many have done so anyway 
interest rates that began to rise last friday have gone so high 
as to provoke worries they are drawing money away from investment 
as well as from financial speculation were following this 
process closely menem said tuesday 
last week interest rates were about 8 percent a month 
the highest monthly rates of 37 percent were offered only to 
large depositors

group of marketing managers for boeing 
she said they were delivered to her by fowler among other 
boeing employees but were not entered into a company log used to 
keep track of classified documents 
at times she obscured with correction fluid or covered with 
small pieces of paper the classification stamp on the documents 
ms mahaffey said 
when the documents became obsolete she said she destroyed 
them i took them home and burned them in my fireplace page by 
page she said 
at one point in the mid 1970s ms mahaffey said she was 
ordered to destroy the documents in the library and to immediately 
leave and lock her office 
instead ms mahaffey said she volunteered to take the 
documents home where they sat in her recreation room for about two 
weeks eventually i was called to come back to work and open up 
shop again she said 
ms mahaffey testified that when she set up the library in kent 
in 1973 or 1974 she was told the data was commonly used 
throughout the industry the impression i had was that the 
documents were not generally in the public domain but that other 
companies had access 
fowler worked at boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986 he 
could face 310 years in prison and fines of 225000 if convicted 
during the first day of testimony monday former secretary of 
defense frank carlucci said it was well known around the pentagon 
that documents fowler is accused of stealing were not releasable 
documents 
but under crossexamination carlucci said that during his time 
at the department of defense he did not believe defense contractors 
were told directly that they couldnt have the documents 
carlucci said the documents fowler is accused of taking were 
among the most sensitive ones in the pentagon outside of 
intelligence documents 
lawyers for fowler said monday that their client did nothing 
illegal and suggested he was being prosecuted because he refused to 
name the defense department employees who gave him the documents 
during opening arguments defense lawyer john bray said the 
rules covering release of such documents are not clear they are 
not specific 
john klein an assistant us attorney told the jury fowler 
engaged in a conspiracy that included the unlawful acquisition 
conveyance use dissemination and destruction of classified 
documents 
boeing pleaded guilty nov 13 to receiving classified documents 
from fowler and agreed to pay 52 million in fines and 
restitution in addition boeing chairman frank shrontz complied 
with a judges order to write a letter of contrition 
the air force has suspended boeings 100person washingtonarea 
office from bidding on contracts and has proposed a longterm 
debarment of the branch office from contract bidding

sweeping political changes in eastern europe and 
west germanys own economic strength have boosted the west german 
mark by nearly 4 percent over the past month to its highest level 
in nearly a year against the us dollar 
analysts say the mark has strengthened amid speculation that 
west germanys central bank will raise interest rates to help curb 
inflation in anticipation that economic growth next year could be 
faster than expected due to an influx of immigrants from east 
germany and eastern europe in general 
the weekend resignation of east germanys politburo propelled 
the mark even higher against major foreign currencies 
the mark has risen nearly 4 percent from early november when 
east germany opened the berlin wall and more than 14 percent from 
the years low of 20290 marks to the dollar on june 14 
in europe late tuesday the dollar was trading at 17790 marks 
compared with 18475 marks on nov 9 
at first the mark fell against the dollar on the dramatic news 
that east germany was opening the berlin wall and the rest of its 
borders because investors traditionally see the dollar as a safe 
haven in times of political uncertainty 
but the mark quickly recovered and started to climb 
the influx of immigrants likely will boost growth in west 
germanys gross national product by up to half a percentage point 
from earlier expectations to 3 percent next year said john 
calverley a senior economist at american express bank ltd in 
london 
west germanys gross national product this year was expected to 
be up to 4 percent 
the logic of it is youre going to have the immigrants of east 
germany and eastern europe coming to west germany needing houses 
and having demand for basic consumer goods calverley said 
west germany traditionally has pursued tight economic policies 
to ensure low inflation which is now running at an annual rate of 
3 percent 
the bundesbank raised its benchmark interest rates by one 
percentage point its fourth rate hike of the year on oct 5 and 
other western european central banks followed suit the same day 
the mark also has been strong because germanys fundamentals 
are good economic growth is strong inflation is under control 
and corporate profits are growing 15 percet this year on average 
said rolf schneider head of the forecasting center at dresdner 
bank in frankfurt 
another factor in the marks strength is that west germanys 
interest rates have been rising as american interest rates have 
fallen narrowing the differential said juergen pfister head of 
economic research at commerzbank in frankfurt 
the marks rise helps west germany fight inflation by lowering 
import prices and boosts american exports to europe calverley 
said 
but it likely will hurt west german exports and that in turn 
could slow the west german economy 
german industry will becomes less competitive obviously from 
the price point of view said dieter wermuth managing director 
of manufacturers hanover bank in frankfurt 
export growth will fall to 8 percent next year from 145 percent 
this year wermuth predicted 
what also has helped the marks rise against the dollar has been 
weakness in the us currency in turn prompted by concerns about 
the us economic outlook the mark also has risen strongly against 
the yen and british pound however 
but some economists think the mark has moved too high and is due 
for what traders call a downward correction with investors 
selling the currency to cash in the gains they have made during the 
recent rally 
some experts also are skeptical that eastern european consumer 
buying will materialize or that the bundesbank again will raise its 
interest rates 
but schneider speculated that any retreat would be technical and 
temporary 
the mark already is considered the strongest currency in the 
european monetary system which links nine of the 12 common market 
currencies to prevent wide swings in their foreign exchange rates 
the system is periodically realigned and the marks recent 
strength increases the likelihood it will be revalued against the 
other ems currencies a move germany would welcome and france 
likely would oppose experts said

stock prices fell today after a morning rally 
fizzled amid profittaking and investor confusion about the 
direction of the economy analysts said 
strength in the high technology sector helped pull the market 
higher in early dealings after international business machines 
corp announced a major restructuring ibm said it planned a 4 
billion share buyback a cutback of 10000 jobs and a 
fourthquarter charge of 23 billion 
ibm is the highlight of the day said emmanuel geronimous 
senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
takeover speculation also helped fuel early gains in other 
bluechip issues including transportation stocks 
but the bluechip rally fizzled as the broader market lagged 
stock prices retreated amid profittaking as investors took 
advantage of the markets recent gains traders said 
thats bound to happen the market was going up with no real 
conviction said charles jensen chief technical analyst for mki 
securities corp 
wall street analysts said investor uncertainty about the economy 
and interest rates remained in the background helping depress 
prices ahead of fridays report on november unemployment recent 
economic data has pointed to a slowdown in economic growth 
observers say stock investors are hoping the unemployment data 
confirms the slowgrowth scenario and prompts the federal reserve 
to take steps to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth 
and corporate earnings in 1990

china has been authorized to buy an additional 
1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
acting undersecretary john b campbell said the wheat will be 
available to china under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 
367 bushels of wheat 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as subsidy 
the subsidies have averaged from around 10 per ton to more 
than 40 per ton of wheat or in the range of 27 cents to about 
110 per bushel 
campbell said 10000 tons remained in the previous eep 
allocation for china announced last feb 27 that allocation was 
for 2 million tons 
china was the largest foreign buyer of us wheat in the 198889 
wheat marketing year that ended last may 31 with orders for nearly 
81 million tons all of it under the eep program 
sales for 198990 total about 47 million tons most of it 
without subsidies 
china is also the worlds largest wheat producer this year with 
an output estimated at 91 million tons that compares with the 
soviet unions harvest of 89 million tons this year and the us 
production of about 56 million tons

mellon bank corp continuing its rebound 
from hard financial times said tuesday it had agreed to pay buy 54 
local branches of psfs the nations oldest mutual savings bank 
meritor savings bank which owns psfs is expected to get about 
335 million from mellon for the branches the move is the latest 
in an assetparing restructuring that meritor started in 1987 
the purchase will more than double mellons deposits in the 
philadelphia area to about 84 million or 143 percent of the 
market corestates will lead the market with 899 million in 
deposits upon completion of its purchase of first pennsylvania 
expected in march 
my guess is the philadelphia market will go through more 
consolidation this puts us in a much more viable position said 
frank v cahouet chairman and chief executive of mellon 
meritors board approved the agreement at a meeting monday 
mellon officials said 
cahouet said the deal fits mellons strategy of increasing its 
retail business the meritor branches will increase mellons retail 
deposits by 36 percent to 19588 billion 
im glad to see mellon thinks its gotten out of the 
turnaround cleanup phase and is looking to expand said 
kenneth f puglisi a stock market analyst at keefe bruyette amp 
woods 
last year mellon lost 65 million or 365 per share in 1987 
mellon lost 844 million or 3119 per share largely because of 
provisions to cover bad loans to developing nations and the 
slumping us oil patch region 
in the first nine months of this year mellon netted 204 
million 
mellon said it expects to finance the purchase by issuing a 
combination of common stock preferred stock and debt in roughly 
equal amounts cahouet said the bank is exploring its financing 
options and the stock and debt issues are the most pessimistic or 
conservative scenario 
after the transaction is completed mellons philadelphia 
subsidiary mellon bank east plans to change its name to 
mellon psfs and plans to operate all its philadelphia area 
branches under that name mellon said 
mellon already has 66 branches in philadelphia and suburban 
counties it will consider closing branches were there is 
duplication but hasnt made any firm decisions said thomas f 
donovan chairman and chief executive of mellon bank east 
donovan said normal attrition should cover any jobs lost in the 
transaction about 750 employees are expected to move from psfs to 
mellon psfs 
we are constantly moving and shifting to see how best to 
address the marketplace it is very important to us to increase 
market share in this area retail banking is very important to 
mellon cahouet said 
the deal leaves meritor with 29 branches nearly all of them in 
philadelphia the remaining branches will change their name to the 
philadelphia savings fund society 
meritor which hasnt seen an annual profit since 1986 and lost 
128 million in the third quarter of this year has been paring 
its operations in a restructuring effort that started in october 
1987 
once the deal with mellon is complete meritors assets will 
have dropped from a june 1987 high of 202 billion to about 8 
billion said meritor spokesman joseph m barrett

copper futures prices fell sharply tuesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as traders reacted to a downturn in demand for 
the metal 
in other markets precious metal futures rebounded from mondays 
selloff grain and soybeans futures were higher while livestock 
futures gained hog futures closed mixed and energy futures climbed 
copper settled 135 cents to 240 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 10620 a pound 
copper prices plunged at the opening bell and continued under 
pressure throughout the day as traders failed to hold support 
levels 
analyst don tierney of stanley bell amp co in new york said 
consumption of copper is declining because of the softening 
economic climate 
precious metal futures rebounded on the comex as traders 
operated on the belief that mondays sharp decline was overdone 
tierney said 
helping gold and silver prices was the weakening of the us 
dollar against the swiss franc and the west german mark 
the advance also was helped by shortcovering by european 
investors who sold the market monday 
gold was 2 to 240 higher with december at 40350 a troy 
ounce silver was 24 cent to 35 cent higher wtih december at 
5533 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher in modest trading 
on the chicago board of trade as the market recovered some losses 
sustained in the previous session 
corn futures led the trend upward in the aftermath of mondays 
us department of agriculture weekly export inspections report 
which was higher than expected said analyst dale gustafson of 
drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the inspections tally of 79 million bushels was well above trade 
estimates for 67 million to 73 million the inspections are an 
indication of the amount of grain ready for export 
nearby wheat prices were lower but the new crop futures gained 
on reports that weather conditions in the winter wheat crop areas 
continue on the dry side 
soybean futures trading continues sluggish as a lack of export 
sales dampens the market soybean prices also were pressured by 
reports the weather in south america is favorable to soybean 
development 
wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 
402 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 2 cents higher with december 
at 234 cents a bushel oats were a 1 cent to 2 cents higher 
with december at 144 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 3 
cents higher with january at 575 cents a bushel 
livestock futures were higher and pork futures mixed on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
hog futures were lifted by firm cash prices said analyst tom 
morgan of sterling research corp in arlington heights ill he 
noted that pork bellies futures were pushed lower by concern over 
the large levels of bellies moving into storage 
concern over a cold snap in the northern plains which could 
adversely affect feeding operations helped to send livestock 
futures higher morgan said 
prices also were helped by news the soviet union may be 
interested in buying us beef 
live cattle were 05 cent to 35 cent higher with december at 
7557 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 35 cent higher 
with january at 8297 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent to 70 cent 
higher with december at 5122 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 22 cent to 70 cent lower with february at 5515 cents a 
pound 
energy futures were higher in moderate trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
there was little news to influence prices and traders awaited 
the release of american petroleum institute inventory figures said 
analyst peter beutel of elders futures inc in new york 
api figures released after the close of trading showed crude 
oil stocks up 845 million barrels in the latest week and refined 
product stocks up 289 million barrels 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 12 cents higher 
with january at 2034 cents a barrel heating oil was 21 cent to

equimark corp tuesday became the third 
institution in recent weeks to delay previously announced buyouts 
of insolvent texas banks 
officials said they expect the deals still will go through but 
its taking longer to put new values on the billions in dollars of 
loans and other assets that have to be reviewed 
pittsburghbased equimark said it would be sometime in the next 
three months before it completes its purchase of san antoniobased 
national bancshares corp of texas originally the deal had been 
expected to close by the end of the year 
last month deposit guaranty bank and bank one corp both 
announced delays in their takeovers of texas american banks and the 
failed mcorp banks respectively 
in all three cases the institutions said they had 
underestimated the time needed to reevaluate the insolvent banks 
holdings the institutions say they are finding no additional 
problems and there is little chance the deals will have to be 
renegotiated

ever put a time frame on when we would like them to close 
equimark announced july 21 it would buy national bancshares 
putting up 31 million of its own money the federal deposit 
insurance corp pledged 250 million in assistance another 86 
million was to be raised privately and national bancshares

liabilities of nbc is very time consuming

bank but the takeover had been complicated by the other 
fdicassisted deals 
all of them have a marktomarket of billions and billions of 
dollars of assets on very large banks all at the same time he 
said it takes longer trying to do three at once 
both bank one and deposit guaranty cited similar problems

suspected violations in live hog futures trading 
at the chicago mercantile exchange are the latest focus of a 
federal probe of the nations largest commodities exchanges a 
newspaper reported tuesday 
federal investigators have issued subpoenas to as many as seven 
hog futures traders the chicago suntimes reported citing 
unidentified merc members and attorneys 
at least one of the traders had been questioned about suspected 
trading violations that occurred as long ago as 1982 the newspaper 
said 
ira raphaelson acting us attorney declined to comment 
tuesday on the report 
merc spokesman andrew yemma also declined comment 
the federal investigation which became known to the public in 
january initially focused on trading in the mercs japanese yen 
and swiss franc pits and on trading in the soybean and us 
treasury bond pits of the chicago board of trade 
the probe has so far resulted in the indictment of 47 traders 
and one clerk of those 14 people have pleaded guilty 
last week in the first known expansion of the investigation out 
of the four initial pits at least nine traders in the mercs 
standard amp poors 500 futures pit were subpoenaed to testify before 
a federal grand jury 
the live hog futures trading pit is the smallest of the pits so 
far affected by the investigation it draws only 40 or 50 traders 
on a busy day less than a tenth as many as some of the more 
active pits

international business machines corp announced 
tuesday it would cut another 10000 us jobs and repurchase 4 
billion of its own stock in a twopronged plan to reduce costs and 
please shareholders 
the worlds biggest computer company also said it would set 
aside 23 billion from its pretax profit to pay for the job cuts 
and related steps that will give ibm a net loss in the fourth 
quarter and guarantee a decline in 1989 earnings compared to 1988 
the company acknowledged that growth in its home market was 
slower than expected as it announced its fourth jobcutting program 
since 1986 
ibm is being squeezed by sluggish spending by its customers 
increasing competition and the personal computer revolution which 
is cutting into sales of the big mainframes and minicomputers that 
account for most of its profits 
unisys corp and wang laboratories inc are among the other 
computer companies that have cut jobs this year they too depend 
heavily on larger computers for profits 
john akers ibms chairman and chief executive told a roomful 
of stock analysts tuesday that the computer industry is under 
stress some would say turmoil 
cautious investors burned by ibms poor stock performance 
barely acknowledged the companys plan the stock rose a slender 
37 cents a share to 9962 in new york stock exchange trading it 
rose 212 a share monday when speculation intensified that the 
company planned job cuts 
the stock remains far below its peak of 17587 in august 1987 
ibm said it would reduce its staff without layoffs by limiting 
hiring and offering incentives to employees to quit or retire 
the company did not announce any closings of facilities and 
akers said no site closings were anticipated however some 
operations at certain sites could be phased out 
ibm expanded rapidly in the early 1980s but has been cutting 
back since 1985 when it became apparent that the industrys rapid 
15 percent annual growth was slowing 
tuesdays announcement was among the most dramatic measures yet 
taken by the company to improve its profitability by cutting costs 
ibm said its growth overseas was strong but the us business 
still was growing more slowly than desired 
they have begun to face up to the realities of what the 
outlook is for the us market said barry bosak a smith barney 
harris upham amp co analyst i think the ground rules changed 
dramatically in the 1980s and the need to streamline 
organizations is there 
the job cuts are intended to reduce the companys us workforce 
to 206000 by the end of 1990 a reduction of more than 37000 from 
1985 levels ibm had 387000 employees worldwide at yearend 1988 
and has been cutting jobs abroad as well 
akers said ibm intended to continue a nolayoff tradition that 
has lasted more than 40 years because it helps the company maintain 
a highquality flexible and dedicated workforce 
he added its impossible to guarantee for all time full 
employment under any and all circumstances 
several analysts agreed that layoffs would be cheaper but would 
damage morale 
ibm said its 4 billion stock buyback if completed would bring 
total repurchases since mid1986 to more than 105 billion 
the repurchase amounts to about 15 percent of the shares 
outstanding in 1986 and is possibly the biggest buyback program 
ever undertaken general electric co last month announced plans to 
repurchase up to 10 billion of its stock over five years the 
largest program ever in a single announcement 
a stock repurchase pleases investors because by taking shares 
off the market it makes the remaining ones more valuable it also 
signals that the company is confident about its own stock 
ibms 23 billion pretax charge against fourthquarter 
earnings breaks down as follows 
500 million for separation payments to people leaving the 
company 
500 million for accounting changes to recognize the shorter 
useful life of ibms investments in software and technology the 
shorter life is good because it shows the company has accelerated 
its schedule of introducing new products 
13 billion for restructuring including consolidations 
capacity reductions and cuts in the valuation of special 
investments such as share ownership in other companies

wheelingpittsburgh steel corp probably 
will remain profitable despite a downturn in the steel industry 
next year but theres no immediate end in sight to the companys 
federal bankruptcy status shareholders were told tuesday 
james l wareham wheelingpitt president and chief operating 
officer blamed the expected downturn on lower steel prices 
throughout the industry 
industry analysts have different views of how deep the 
downturn will be and how long it will last wareham said during 
the companys annual stockholders meeting we forecast a 
relatively short down cycle 
william j scharffenberger wheelingpitt board chairman and 
chief executive officer said legal constraints would prevent the 
steelmaker from emerging from us bankruptcy court protection 
before june 1990 the company filed for chapter 11 protection on 
april 16 1985 
scharffenberger said several major factors remain to be settled 
including a new labor agreement with the united steelworkers of 
america which he predicted will be forthcoming by january 
scharffenberger and wareham refused to comment on the labor 
negotiations which continued tuesday in pittsburgh 
union officials have said previously that they are interested in 
regaining some of the concessions made in the 1982 and 1985 
contracts 
despite the expected downturn wareham said the company intends 
to go ahead with about 100 million in improvements next year 
including clean air projects at martins ferry ohio clean water 
projects and upgrading of the 80inch hot strip mill in 
steubenville ohio and an automatic gauge control at allenport pa

georgiapacific corp extended its 36 billion 
offer to buy rival papermaker great northern nekoosa corp for one 
week tuesday but officials of the target remained opposed to the 
deal 
the 63ashare bid originally set to expire at midnight est 
monday was extended by georgiapacific until midnight dec 11 
we feel as we announced previously that consummation of the 
merger would violate applicable antitrust laws said great 
northern spokesman stephen hill 
officials of norwalk connbased great northern have refused to 
discuss the proposed merger with georgiapacific though the 
chairman of the atlanta company said great northern shareholders 
already have indicated they favor the takeover 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn said 323 million 
shares of great northern stock already have been tendered since his 
company made the takeover bid representing nearly 59 percent of 
total shares outstanding 
that is a very substantial percentage and we believe the 
shareholders are sending the clear message to great northerns 
board and management that they want our offer to be accepted 
hahn said 
hill said great northern did not view the tender in the same 
light as you know people could withdraw that at any time he 
said 
great northern stock was up 25 cents a share to 6162 in early 
new york stock exchange trading tuesday 
chad e brown an industry analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
inc in new york said georgiapacific had no choice at this time 
but to extend the offer 
he noted that a number of matters justice department 
clearance a legal challenge to maines corporate takeover statute 
and a challenge to great northerns antitakeover provisions must 
be resolved before georgiapacific can proceed with the proposed 
acquisition 
certain conditions hadnt been met brown said the choice 
was to withdraw and let it the offer expire and thats not a 
choice 
he said it is possible that the offer will be extended again 
dec 11 
atlantabased georgiapacific raised its offer from 58 a share 
to 63 nov 19 after great northerns board rejected the original 
oct 31 offer 
georgiapacific meanwhile filed a motion late monday in us 
district court in portland maine asking for a ruling in its 
lawsuit challenging the poison pill antitakeover provisions of 
great northerns bylaws great northern is incorporated in maine 
georgiapacific said the poison pill violates the maine business 
corporation act because it lets owners of stock in takeover targets 
except for the hostile suitor buy moreshares at a 50 percent 
discount 
great northern filed an objection tuesday to georgiapacifics 
request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary 
injunction 
georgiapacific wants to stop great northern from changing its 
financial structure to make itself more difficult to acquire 
unless it provides 72 hours notice and also wants to move up a 
shareholders meeting from march to within 30 days so shareholders 
can vote quickly on the tender offer 
great northern says georgiapacific has shown no good reason to 
move the meeting up and it has said the 72hour notice would not 
give its directors enough flexibility to manage the companys 
affairs 
great northern had sales of 36 billion in 1988 from its paper 
pulp box lumber and plywood operations georgiapacific had 95 
billion in sales

prudentialbache securities inc has raised the 
commission it charges most individual customers by about 3 percent 
a spokesman said tuesday 
prudentialbache also said it has informed its 6500 brokers it 
was reducing the amount of commission revenue it shares with its 
lowestproducing brokers 
the moves are the latest costcutting measures by a wall street 
firm during a sharp downturn in brokerage and investment banking 
activity other firms have laid off workers and reduced commissions 
paid to stockbrokers 
prudentialbache said it did not expect the increased commission 
charges to deter investors and said they were necessary because of 
rising costs 
smith barney harris upham amp co in september raised retail and 
institutional commission rates by about 4 percent 
while it did not increase customer rates shearson lehman hutton 
inc last month said it would cut stockbrokers commissions by 1 to 
2 percentage points in 1990

investors are reacting cautiously to reports that 
the management of ual corp has put together a revised employee 
buyout plan for the parent of united airlines an analyst said 
tuesday 
the caution is indicated by the failure of ual stock to make the 
huge leaps in value that characterized the stock shortly after 
california investor marvin davis announced earlier this year he was 
interested in acquiring ual 
davis 275ashare 619 billion offer for ual was later 
followed by one from a pilotmanagement group which made a 
300ashare 675 billion 
ual stock was trading at a 52week high of 294 a share in 
october when it appeared the pilotmanagement groups offer seemed 
close to success 
samuel buttrick an analyst with kidder peabody amp co in new 
york said ual stock has been on a roller coaster since the 
collapse of the pilotmanagement buyout offer 
ual stock lost 40 percent of its value with the bids collapse 
at one point trading around 145 a share buttrick said ual stock 
closed monday at 18225 a share up 275 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
it has been a very rocky road for ual stock buttrick said 
noting its price rose when coniston partners announced its 97 
percent stake in ual then fell as speculators became impatient 
with the lack of positive news on a new management bid 
coniston partners a new york investment group has threatened a 
drive to oust 13 of uals 15 directors and create a fivemember 
board dominated by coniston if the companys board fails to sell or 
restructure ual 
ual stock climbed 525 on monday following conistons 
announcement it had increased its stake in the company to 118 
percent and after reports of a revised employee buyout proposal 
were circulated over the weekend 
analysts believe the boards buyout plan will value the company 
at 210 to 240 a share or a total of 475 billion to 542 
billion 
buttrick said the rise in ual stock price reflects a 
confirmation of what everybody suspected was going on behind the 
scenes 
the answer as to why the price hasnt gone higher is that 
there isnt a confirmed deal he said 
bobbie pilkington a spokeswoman for the united chapter of the 
association of flight attendants said tuesday that a revised 
buyout plan will be presented to the union on wednesday 
the session was to have been the start of a new round of 
contract talks between the union and the airline the flight 
attendants have been working without a contract for two years 
ual management is believed to be seeking ironclad commitments 
from lenders and the companys three major unions before publicly 
announcing a revised buyout effort 
the previous buyout attempt was led by uniteds management 
pilots and british airways plc that bid failed in october when 
lenders refused to finance it citing the strong opposition of the 
machinists 
telephone calls to machinist union headquarters for comment on 
the revised buyout effort were not returned tuesday 
united pilots have long sought ownership of the carrier the 
nations secondlargest and are believed to be working with 
management on the new proposal 
spokeswoman kathie hardin of the united chapter of the air line 
pilots association declined to comment tuesday

the attorney for a man accused of 
masterminding a 10 million extortion scheme against du pont co 
denied tuesday that his client attempted to sell trade secrets for 
lycra fabric back to the chemical giant 
richard zappa cocounsel for bruno skerianz said in opening 
arguments in skerianz us district court trial that du pont first 
approached skerianz about documents allegedly taken from the 
companys lycra plant in mercedes argentina 
lycra is a spandex fiber used in clothing such as swimming suits 
and leotards du pont says it sold about 600 million of lycra last 
year 
skerianz raul armando giordano and antonio ruben inigo are 
charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy if convicted they 
face up to 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
zappa said wilmingtonbased du pont wanted to eliminate 
competition by entrapment otherwise it would have charged the 
defendants with theft of the documents 
he accused du pont of making the fbi and the us attorneys 
office its private police force to make an example of the 
defendants to ward off anyone planning to compete in the spandex 
market 
zappa said skerianz could not be accused of extortion because he 
never asked du pont for money instead the company offered to pay 
10 million to get the documents back according to zappa 
in his opening arguments assistant us attorney edmond 
falgowski reviewed the scenario that led up to the arrests in 
february 
falgowski said skerianz would have sold the documents to a du 
pont competitor had the company not agreed to pay 
unless du pont paid 10 million for its own technology they 
would sell trade secrets to competitors falgowski said 
the three defendants are argentine nationals and former 
employees at the mercedes plant a fourth former employee jose 
maria petrosino is fighting extradition from geneva switzerland 
maria i lorenzo de bianchini also a former employee has 
agreed to testify for the government in exchange for charges being 
dropped against her 
girodano was a superintedent of lycra operations and inigo was a 
maintenance supervisor at the plant they had quit their jobs up to 
three months before du pont was contacted about the documents in 
december 1988 
de bianchini was a secretary in the lycra information office 
she quit her job about the same time 
all but petrosino were arrested in geneva in february when an 
attempt to meet du pont officials to turn over the documents and 
get the 10 million was aborted
