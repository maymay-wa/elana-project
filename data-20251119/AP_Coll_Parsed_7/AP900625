mayor marion barry ordered fourday layoffs in 
august for some 26000 district of columbia employees to offset a 
projected 95 million budget deficit city officials said on monday 
once again city employees are being asked to bite the bullet 
for mismanagement of the city government said david a schlein 
head of the local chapter of the american federation of government 
employees the furloughs are not a solution for what is clearly a 
longterm problem 
the union represents nearly 6000 members of the citys 
48000member work force 
the furlough package reviewed by barry over the weekend is 
scheduled to take effect in august city administrator carol 
thompson said 
the fiscal package includes new taxes on public utilities and 
commercial property owners and spending cuts in human services job 
training and other government programs 
employees will take four days of unpaid leave on a staggered 
schedule designed to minimize the impact on the daytoday 
operations the furlough would not affect police fire and 
correctional officers or employees at dc general hospital and 
other roundthe clock operations district officials said the 
public school system and other independent agencies also will not 
be affected 
the administration has proposed reducing spending in the citys 
31 billion operating budget by 45 million while the proposed 
new taxes would raise about 40 million for the fiscal year the 
furlough would save an estimated 4 million according to officials

a ku klux klan leader says he hopes a challenge 
of a georgia law that bans masks in public will produce more 
members and more donations 
a lot of people told us theyd be happy to join if they could 
remain anonymous said dave holland grand dragon of the southern 
knights of the kkk 
with them its possible wed have enough financial 
contributions to run people for office 
the 1951 law was struck down may 25 by a judge who said it 
violated a klansmans right to free speech the klansman had staged 
a masked oneman demonstration at a courthouse and was arrested on 
the misdemeanor 
the state appealed the judges ruling to the georgia supreme 
court which will hear arguments in september the law which 
carries up to a 1000 fine or a year in jail is being enforced in 
the meantime 
some who monitor hate groups fear a resurgence in klan strength 
and violence if klansmen are allowed to wear masks 
the fear is unwarranted holland insisted 
the people who would only join a protest anonymously would be 
local businessmen school teachers police officers people who 
would not carry out acts of violence he said last week 
danny levitas executive director of the center for democratic 
renewal which monitors hate groups called gwinnett county judge 
howard cooks ruling a major setback for civil rights activists 
the law forbids people from concealing their identity on public 
property it exempts holiday costumes gas masks for safety reasons 
or sports masks 
authors of the law said it was intended to destroy the klan 
the judge said the law was vague and too broad he agreed with 
the klan that its members could face persecution for their racist 
views if they did not have the protection of hoods and masks 
the southern knights of the kkk refuses to say how many members 
it has or discuss its finances 
david fuller the assistant solicitor who argued the case said 
violence would increase if klan members identities were protected 
it goes against everything thats right to give constitutional 
protection to a group thats sworn to accomplish their goals 
through unconstitutional means he said 
shade miller jr the klansman who was arrested in february for 
wearing a mask testified he feared for his safety and his familys 
if his klan affiliation were widely known 
i could lose my job my family might be in danger if 
people knew i was a klansman miller testified 
levitas said he has no data on how many klan activities in the 
last 10 years were committed in mask 
but he cited a 1983 incident in tallapoosa in which six men in 
klan masks broke into the home of an interracial couple and beat 
the husband as he helped his daughter with her homework four klan 
members were convicted on federal charges

up for sale at one of europes 
poshest auctions graffiticovered segments of the berlin wall sold 
for as much as 33000 for a 25ton chunk 
about 40 pieces of the wall were sold saturday night at the 
metropole palace for a total of 630000 the proceeds were to 
benefit public health services in east germany 
but many lots were withdrawn by the organizers a consortium of 
east german and west german companies because no bidders reached 
the minimum sale prices set in advance these prices ranged from 
12600 to 36000 
the biggest spender was an unidentified swiss buyer who bought 
eight chunks for 175000 
most of the pieces up for bid weighed more than two tons and 
were almost 12 feet high which may have inhibited collectors with 
limited display space 
a glossy catalogue prepared for the auction depicted the wall 
segments in the same sort of language usually reserved for 
prestigious art works 
one chunk was described as anonymous graffito an original 
painting in a very good state of preservation slight damage to the

loggers in this olympic peninsula town 
have always known that the supply of huge ancient trees they depend 
on would start to run out some day they just didnt expect it this 
summer 
and if you had told them their whining chain saws and rumbling 
log trucks would be silenced by a fluffy 22ounce owl they 
probably would have laughed themselves right off a stump 
nobodys laughing now in neilton its one of dozens of pacific 
northwest towns suddenly facing economic ruin during what was 
supposed to be the timber industrys biggest boom in a decade 
the us fish and wildlife service on friday declared the 
northern spotted owl a threatened species under the endangered 
species act saying the bird might become extinct if its habitat in 
oldgrowth forests is not protected 
officials plan to hold off releasing a protection plan for the 
owl until later this week but under one scenario proposed earlier 
this year by a team of federal scientists timber harvests could be 
reduced by nearly half in the oldgrowth national forests of 
washington oregon and northern california 
those bans could cost 28000 jobs in the region over 10 years 
and tear apart timber towns with increased rates of violence 
divorce and suicide a federal study predicts 
neilton a tightly knit village of 400 surrounded by the olympic 
national forest has felt the pinch since january 1989 when the 
us forest service began slowing down timber sales to protect 
nesting areas of the secretive owl in anticipation of preservation 
measures 
existing contracts have kept some neilton loggers in business 
but most of those will run out this summer forest service 
officials said the agency scrambled to find a few oldgrowth 
parcels outside critical owl habitats for cutting this fall but 
loggers say those trees will keep them working only a few months 
one mill that produces cedar shingles for roofing already has 
closed here and another is struggling to find enough raw material 
school enrollment has declined 12 percent since september 
almost every house in town has a sign in the window proclaiming 
this family supported by timber dollars but many residents 
fear theyll soon be replaced by for sale signs 
its been pretty slim and i know its going to get slimmer 
said stanley metcalf 52 who now runs only two of his six 
loghauling trucks everybody in town is worried about their 
homes their families their businesses 
in some timber towns worry has turned to anger loggers have 
rallied in noisy protests from redding calif to aberdeen wash 
environmentalists consider the northwests ancient forests 
precious national resources that clean the air and trap flood 
waters all while providing opportunities for solace and recreation 
they say the towering evergreens 1000 years and older anchor 
a complex ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife absent in 
younger forests 
we have strong scientific evidence that an indicator of the 
health of the ecosystem the northern spotted owl is in very grave 
peril and that tells us that the ecosystem is in grave peril 
said melanie rowland an attorney for the wilderness society 
but charlie miller who has been in the logging business for 40 
years sees the big trees differently 
theyre overripe he said those trees should have been 
logged years ago our forest is just like a corn field in nebraska 
when that corn field is ripe youve got to cut it 
forty years ago miller had plenty of support for his views in 
1952 a forest service researcher called the ancient forests 
biological deserts and foresters saw nothing wrong with 
cutting old trees that had slowed their growth to make way for new 
stands of rapidly growing trees 
the philosophy fit well with commercial interests which valued 
the oldgrowth trees for their tight grain durability and lack of 
knots 
oldgrowth forests on private lands disappeared first after 
world war ii cutting on the northwests 12 national forests 
increased to fill the gap 
concerns about overharvesting surfaced in the late 1960s about 
the same time as researchers discovered that ancient forests were 
hardly biological deserts 
but the cutting continued 
since the early 1970s environmental groups pressured the fish 
and wildlife service to declare the owl threatened after years of 
delays lawsuits finally forced the agency to take a closer look at 
the owl population 
today nobody knows exactly how much remains of the west coasts 
original 17 million acres of oldgrowth forest federal estimates 
range from 32 million to 71 million acres scattered in patches up 
and down the pacific coast and estimates by industry and 
environmentalists vary even more 
and researchers dont know how many owls there are but they 
estimate the owl has lost 80 percent of its habitat since 1800 
even without the owl recent developments have already reduced 
the amount of national forest oldgrowth timber available to 
loggers additions to the wilderness preservation system have taken 
land out of logging and this month the forest service announced 
plans to reduce logging by 46 percent in the mount bakersnoqualmie 
national forest washingtons largest national forest 
this is public land and that is what the timber industry is 
forgetting said rowland the wilderness society attorney i 
bridle when they say it is their forest it simply is not 
as the region becomes more urbanized and diversified whats 
best for the timber industry is no longer necessarily whats best 
for the northwest she said logging and milling account for just 6 
percent of total employment in oregon 2 percent in washington and 
less than onehalf percent in california according to state 
officials 
its understandable why congress would not worry about the loss 
of 28000 jobs over such a large region said bill pickell head of 
the washington state contract loggers association 
but the jobs to be lost are concentrated in isolated towns 
which often have no way to replace them he said 
well have appalachia west out here pickell said 
state officials in washington and oregon are urging federal 
agencies to phase in any logging bans to let the industry adjust to 
lessdesirable young trees there have also been calls for federal 
aid to the loggers 
environmental reforms do not come free said rep ron wyden 
dore working families dont have the resources to prepare 
for changes forced by new environmental laws there is a real moral 
obligation for the government to assist those families 
president bush disagrees he said earlier this month that while 
he is concerned about timber workers he would oppose federal help 
for job retraining 
other relief may be on the way congress is considering measures 
to restrict or ban exports of raw timber thereby increasing the 
supply available to local mills 
but at this point loggers have little patience for government 
promises said neilton resident duane sim and the fight could get 
even nastier 
im not going to say what were going to do sim said but 
you can bet were not going to just roll over

mark taynton was among the first americans to 
die in the korean war he was thrown into the breach against north 
korean invaders 
schuyler b cole was among the last the war had bogged down 
roughly along the same line where it started when soldiers died 
over map points named pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge 
leslie doyle rader was killed at inchon when the americans 
gained the offensive 
fellow marine william g windrich died a hero at the chosin 
reservoir after communist china entered the war his tombstone 
notes he won the medal of honor 
if the war didnt end with the clearcut results some wanted 
and if things arent perfect in korea today well nobody can fault 
these men 
yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white 
marble headstones at arlington national cemetery there is no patch 
of ground no monument of carved black granite for korean veterans 
only now 40 years later is a memorial in the works 
authorized by congress in 1986 it will adjoin the lincoln 
memorial across the reflecting pool from the vietnam memorial if 
11 million in private contributions can be raised by 1991 about 
62 million has been raised so far 
for the people who fought bled or died in korea its about 
time 
its an overdue thank you said retired col john fc 
kenney a member of the korean war veterans association and former 
executive director of the korean war memorial advisory board 
the nation owes some form of recognition to those who without 
all the fanfare of a war to save the world marched off quietly to 
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their 
country asked them to do so kenney said 
the memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers each 8 feet tall 
walking from a copse of trees toward an american flag there will 
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead 
we were the silent veterans of the forgotten war says frank 
kerr a boston public relations executive who fought with the 
marines at chosin those who died enobled that time and place it 
was like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasnt a ripple 
that forgotten war began june 25 1950 when north korean tanks 
clanked southward across the 38th parallel it ended july 27 1953 
not with a final peace but an armistice about 43000 us 
soldiers are still in korea serving as a trip wire in case the 
north invades again 
most americans get their images of the korean war from mash 
reruns 40 percent of the country is too young to remember it 
firsthand 
korea was a nasty war more artillery fell on it than was fired 
in all of world war ii in 37 months 54248 americans died 
33629 of them in combat the rest in accidents or from sickness 
in vietnam the us dead reached 58149 in more than 10 years of 
fighting 
there are 8177 mias and 389 unaccountedfor pows all of them 
presumed dead thirtyeight percent of american pows died in 
captivity 
korea was a harbinger almost all the ingredients of vietnam 
were present in korea east asia an undeclared limited war a 
conflict between northern communists and a southern republic and 
american war technology against a determined but illequipped foe 
but mostly korea was a war unlike any the american public ever 
had been asked to support americans watched with some fascination 
as the usled united nations troops were almost overrun then 
counterattacked all the way to north korea then were beaten back 
by hordes of chinese troops 
one year after the shooting started the lines stabilized at 
roughly the 38th parallel peace talks dragged on for two years 
and 45 percent of the casaulties came after the stalemate on the 
battlefield 
at first most americans in those communistconscious times 
approved but america soon was turned off by a nowin stagnant 
war there were no patriotic ditties by irving berlin but no 
antiwar songs either there were no parades but no draftcard 
burnings or kent states 
it fell off the front pages it just sort of petered out in a 
very negative way nobody wanted to think about this thing said 
historian clay blair author of korea the forgotten war 
when the war was over people went back to their jobs and 
didnt talk about it when your country asked you to do something 
you do it said dick adams former member of the 25th infantry 
division and now president of the korean war veterans association 
was korea worth it 
veterans say just ask anybody if theyd rather live in the 
north one of the last vestiges of ironclad stalinism or in the 
south a bustling industrial power that was host to the 1988 
olympic games 
my view is we accomplished our mission in full said gen 
richard stilwell who commanded ground forces in korea and now 
heads the effort to build the korean memorial korea was the 
cornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided the 
bulwark of what is happening in eastern europe 
it was a complete victory we did what we set out to do we 
stopped the communists it was worth every inch of it said 
william norris of waterford ny founder of the korean war 
veterans association 
the veterans group was formed in 1984 norris daughter wanted 
to do a school paper but couldnt find any library books on korea 
the place where her father fought and his buddies died 
it irritated me i started it so nobody would ever forget 
norris said 
the group already has remembered to remember it placed a 
granite meditation bench near arlingtons tomb of the unknown 
soldier on july 27 1987 
it is carved with this quote from herman wouk the beginning 
of the end of war lies in remembrance

from the general who objected to giving away 
eastern europe to the woman who denounced glasnost for corrupting 
youth russian communists have displayed a conservative bent that 
spells trouble for mikhail s gorbachev 
the criticism of gorbachev and the partys ruling politburo 
including calls for the entire leadership to resign reached such 
a crescendo at a party conference that gorbachev remarked 
all thats left is for one of the speakers to say line them 
up against the wall 
there were calls for discipline and party purges at the fiveday 
meeting of communists in the biggest soviet party it was 
considered a dress rehearsal for the key national party congress 
that opens in a week 
it was a forceful but worried gorbachev who took center stage at 
the gatherings end saturday to try to get the production running 
as he wanted albeit at the 11th hour 
gorbachev told the 2700 delegates who will make up the 
majority at the national congress that they would have to accept 
that the party must become a new party otherwise he said 
it will end up on the sidelines of history 
but the delegates showed they were reluctant to accept his 
innovations in everything from the military and foreign policy to 
the economy and culture 
col gen albert makashov complained that in eastern europe 
the soviet army is being driven out without a battle from the 
countries that our fathers freed from fascism 
delegate olga akimkina warned the theory of socialism is being 
distorted and that the party would lose its youth to the new 
permissiveness 
do we really think that if more pornography and sex are shown 
then young people will become more patriotic and goaloriented 
she asked 
one questioner warned that gorbachevs reforms had dangerously 
weakened the army another complained that the soviet president was 
too tolerant of us pressure to allow lithuania to secede 
perhaps the most telling comments came from yegor k ligachev 
known as the most conservative member of the politburo and 
according to one source a contender against gorbachev for the 
partys top post at the july 2 congress 
ligachev complained that the party had been left out of several 
major recent decisions including the governments unpopular 
proposal for a gradual transition to a market economy 
he also warned of the growing work of antisocialist forces to 
weaken and ultimately destroy the communist party from within 
by furthering revisionist tendencies that allow private 
property intraparty fractions and other ideological sacrilege 
ligachevs complaints touched on the essence of gorbachevs 
reforms and revealed one of the presidents most controversial 
plans as party chief to transfer some of the partys power to the 
government 
gorbachev is trying to move the country away from ideology and 
toward a whateverworks philosophy 
but why should the communist party support a man intent on 
giving away its power when an alternative candidate pledges to 
struggle for keeping the party strong 
perhaps partly out of displeasure with his proposed changes in 
the partys role 38 percent of the electors in one moscow district 
voted against gorbachevs selection as a congress delegate 
the delegates proved their preference for the hard line by 
electing as their party chief ivan polozkov a man known for 
quashing the fledgling private businesses allowed under gorbachevs 
reforms 
using oldstyle ideological rhetoric that gorbachev rarely 
resorts to these days he declared the party should be loyal to 
the ideas of the october revolution and its basis will be 
marxistleninist theory socialist ideals 
polozkovs election increased the chances of a split in the 
party doubling gorbachevs challenge he now has to not only 
remain at the partys helm but keep it from breaking apart as well 
he warned saturday that a split would be a gift to those who 
want to bury perestroika and threw all his powers of persuasion 
including a sudden tone of urgency into his appeal against the 
split 
but with the national congress a week away odds remained high 
that the communist party would see its first major schism since the 
time of lenin

foreign secretary raul manglapus told 
career filipino diplomats today that he seeks to revive the 
countrys ties with the hispanic world so they must master spanish 
if they wish to advance 
in a directive to foreign service employees published in local 
papers manglapus said that in requiring knowledge of spanish the 
philippines is going back to a language that will restore us to 
our family of nations that will provide us with the backing we 
need 
we are going back to a language that is no longer a language 
of the oppressors said manglapus who is fluent in english and 
spanish today mostly in latin america it is the language of 
revolution of social change 
he said the widespread use of english identified the philippines 
with the united states but that in the united nations and other 
world forums not everybody is in favor of the us when it comes 
to voting 
spain ruled the philippines for 350 years until it lost the 
colony to the americans during the spanishamerican war in 1898 
but spanish was never as widely spoken among the indigenous 
population as it was in spains colonies in latin america 
after 1898 the americans introduced english which remains an 
official language along with filipino a malayopolynesian language 
based on tagalog 
spanish is no longer a required course of study in philippine 
schools and relatively few of the 60 million filipinos speak it 
fluently 
but the vocabularies of tagalog and other philippine languages 
contain many words of spanish origin

machine guntoting guerrillas some in 
dresses for lack of other clothes cruise the streets of liberias 
secondlargest city in stolen pickup trucks waiting for the order 
to invade the capital 
they are biding their time confident they can defeat government 
troops and force out or kill president samuel doe 
buchanan a port city 90 miles southeast of the capital of 
monrovia and the countrys industrial center is at a standstill 
trains that carry iron ore timber and rubber are idle and no 
ships call to take deliveries 
it is a city of rusting corrugated tin shanties and homes burned 
by government soldiers who were chased out by rebels of the 
national patriotic front 
no stores are open and gasoline is almost gone at the only 
station in town where there is any rebels pas the day dropping 
soda bottles down tubes to fish out fuel little by little 
the rebels led by former doe aide charles taylor invaded 
liberia on dec 24 they reached buchanan on may 19 and after a 
week of heavy fighting and scores of deaths they finally won 
control of the city 
other rebels are within 15 miles of monrovia and leaders say 
all of their forces are poised to storm the capital 
peace talks between the government and the rebels were to resume 
monday in neighboring sierra leone and the leader of the 
government delegation said he expected a settlement 
we have come to make peace and that is going to happen 
information minister emmanuel bowier said sunday 
but the rebels say doe must step down for any settlement 
if he decides to stay we will fight and we know who will die 
and who will live said one commando wearing grenades bullets 
and a headband of seashells who called himself rebel 60 
he patrolled buchanans streets with four other rebels and two 
goats in the back of his pickup a government soldiers skull was 
tied to the front of the commandeered truck 
amos kanga 27 sang to himself as he carried a skull down a 
dirt road toward a rebel checkpoint outside buchanan he was taking 
it back to decorate his guard post 
it will be shining come back and see he said with a grin 
the rebels are a motley ragtag force who arm and clothe 
themselves with anything they can capture or steal 
buchanan residents remember rebels directing gunfire at liberian 
army positions while other insurgents stood by and tried on pants 
looted from local residences 
many wear torn filthy clothes some sport colored ski goggles 
huge stereo headphones connected to nothing bright orange life 
vests garish womens wigs dresses and even rubber halloween 
masks 
theyre like teenage mutant ninja rebels says one 
foreigner in buchanan referring to the turtle warrior cartoon 
characters 
alhough the rebels are unruly they are by most accounts far 
less brutal than the government troops 
one foreigner who has stayed in buchanan told of how government 
troops shot out windows and blasted through the door of his house 
where about 30 of his firms employees had taken refuge 
they burst in and demanded if were harboring rebels said 
the foreigner who spoke on condition of anonymity they didnt 
find any so they took 2000 instead 
such belligerence has left residents edgy im afraid to go 
out said a 26yearold liberian woman who lives just outside 
buchanan anytime someone just says hey my heart jumps 
the army has been accused of atrocities but taylors forces 
have been accused of random violence as well 
johnny konoh 28 a hospital orderly says he was shot june 1 by 
a rebel soldier while he was wearing his blueandwhite uniform 
with a red cross on the chest 
the rebel threatened to kill him then shot him twice one shot 
hit a shoulder and the other grazed his face disfiguring an eye 
nothing have i done to him konoh said i dont know why 
sporadic fighting has continued for weeks at the 
bridgestonefirestone rubber plantation about 35 miles by road 
from monrovia and next to the nations international airport 
moses blah leading a rebel patrol at the plantation repeated 
taylors claim that the rebels can take monrovia in 12 hours 
we are trained in guerrilla fighting and commando naval 
fighting and city fighting he said we can even fight in the

brutalized by four decades of eastern 
europes harshest communist rule bucharest remains a capital of 
fear and violence 
the inauguration of a new government was conducted in an 
atmosphere of paranoia violent attacks on government institutions 
and mob rule by miners heeding an appeal to defend the authorities 
those who mistrusted a government they say is neocommunist now 
loathe it the authorities apparently stunned by the violence and 
international outrage at the miners rampage are fearful of new 
outbursts 
after such a bloody riot it is very easy to bring people back 
onto the street said adrian severin the man charged with the 
task of privatizing romanias economy the hate in the peoples 
soul was not at all consumed 
fear the principal instrument of the communists control over 
eastern europe and the loathing it engendered were never strangers 
in bucharest 
romania a blend of latin passion and the subservient traditions 
of the orthodox church gained wobbly independence in the late 19th 
century after centuries of violent corrupt ottoman rule 
the addition of large hungarian german and other minorities as 
a result of world war i enhanced the sense of insecurity and 
shifting loyalties communist rule imposed the outward quiet of 
repression on the people 
the brief euphoria at the demise of nicolae ceausescu in 
december swiftly gave way to a fear of being shot by securitate 
snipers defending his rule 
by march there was fear of the curious absence of all those who 
made up the network of terror romanians had lived with for years 
you know what people are saying asked a 20yearold who was 
trusting the revolution only enough to seize the chance of free 
travel and move west before the revolution you saw securitate 
everywhere now you cant see them at all 
last week the old fears returned 
a young man who would not give his name related signs of renewed 
surveillance of contact with foreigners 
students shocked by the miners attacks on their colleagues and 
friends talked suddenly of leaving for good 
an anxious couple who sent their child outside bucharest when 
the violence started vowed to stay caught between despair 
bravado and lack of choice 
a society that has long isolated its intellectuals terrorized 
them with some passersby telling miners whom to attack 
a poet nastasia maniu was seized simply because she has the 
same surname as a longdeceased leader of the opposition national 
peasants party said writer stefan doinas 
doinas had to telephone a senior general to secure the release 
of another poet held by police for 36 hours after he refused to 
show miners his papers 
traditional phobias about outsiders surfaced 
when two western journalists questioned miners about why they 
came the crowd that gathered argued not about the miners 
behavior but whether they should discuss with foreigners anything 
potentially harmful to the governments image 
paranoia also affected the seemingly powerful 
in a western capital about six policemen using polite but firm 
language could have dispersed the few antigovernment protesters 
who returned to university square june 17 in defiance of the 
crackdown four days earlier 
in bucharest military police lurked in back streets ordinary 
police were nowhere in sight 
the demonstrators swelled by hundreds of sympathizers and 
intensely watched by foreign journalists thus blocked traffic for 
hours before melting away into the night 
state tv crews filming from afar out of apparent fear of being 
attacked showed footage of situation the outoftown miners saw 
the film and reportedly called the government volunteering to 
return the authorities now trying to mend their shattered image 
declined 
in this there was the threat of force and a clear decision not 
to use it there was also the absence of normal policing and no 
clear explanation of why 
unfortunately the structure of power is very vulnerable 
said adrian nastase spokesman for the ruling national salvation 
front 
the police and army forced initially to defend ceausescu in 
december lack such tools as tear gas to control crowds and are 
paralyzed by the complex of guilt he argued 
nastases explanation sounds disingenuous to critics how could 
a party that won 66 percent of votes for parliamentary seats led 
by a man who gained 85 percent of presidential votes have so 
little power 
government associates cautioned journalists to remember that 
this is the balkans 
once you arouse emotions here it is not so easy to control 
them said dan iosif a tough worker who is a leading front 
figure and member of the senate the upper chamber of parliament 
severin argued that president ion iliescu was really scared 
by what he considered organized attacks on government institutions 
june 13 he summoned workers without realizing he would get the 
uncontrollable miners to get them to go home he had to thank them 
first severin argued 
this conveys a picture of a government lurching from crisis to 
crisis 
the crowds seem volatile quickly stirred by political debate 
or a prized delivery of meat 
fear and suspicion are in the air creating tension as palpable 
as the dust from ceausescus grandiose construction schemes nearing 
completion in the city center

two starcrossed lovers who rewrote the 
plays of shakespeare for amusement committed reallife murder most 
foul 
jens soering and elizabeth haysom honor students at the 
university of virginia plotted the fatal stabbings of miss 
haysoms parents in 1985 and fled to london 
a jury thursday found soering guilty of two counts of murder and 
recommended two life terms miss haysom testified against him after 
pleading guilty to being an accessory to murder she was sentenced 
to 90 years in prison 
at soerings trial miss haysom 26 testified that soering 
stabbed her parents derek and nancy haysom because they wanted to 
end her relationship with soering and because soering wanted to win 
her love 
miss haysom admitted playing lady macbeth by manipulating 
soering a pudgy bookish west german and diplomats son who was in 
love for the first time she said she was in washington preparing 
alibis while soering committed the deed 
but soering 23 painted himself as a lovestruck chivalrous 
young man 
he testified that miss haysom committed the murders and 
persuaded him to take the blame to save her from the electric 
chair soering said he figured he faced deportation and a light 
sentence 
however authorities in london agreed when they arrested the two 
to turn soering over to the united states if prosecutors would not 
press for the death penalty 
miss haysom had attended one of britains finest boarding 
schools wycombe abbey where she played the dangerous enchantress 
cleopatra in antony and cleopatra 
she was accepted into britains national theatre and wrote three 
plays of her own she and her lover shared an interest in 
shakespeare

in which lady macbeth persuades her husband to commit murder 
did you see yourself as lady macbeth updike asked miss 
haysom 
yes sir i did she responded 
miss haysoms father was stabbed 39 times her mother was 
stabbed eight times their throats were slashed

house majority leader richard gephardt took a 
verbal beating from just about everyone when he suggested three 
months ago that the united states give economic aid to the soviet 
union 
maybe hell come up with a brilliant idea one of these days 
president bush said sarcastically the consensus on capitol hill 
was that gephardt had committed a political blunder 
now with an economic summit meeting just two weeks away the 
white house is mulling over guess what yes its us 
participation in something much like gephardt suggested and the 
missouri democrat is smiling 
the soviet people are at a crossroads gephardt said last 
week they will decide in the next six months whether to continue 
on the road to reform or to fall back to something out of their 
past we ought to be trying to figure out what we can reasonably 
do 
he added we ought to be leading this is the grandest and 
best opportunity weve been presented with in 50 years 
gephardts march 6 speech grew out of a trip to eastern europe 
during the winter and from an eloquent address delivered to 
congress by czechoslovakias president vaclav havel havel said 
the best way to help his country was to ensure that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs reforms succeed 
in remarks harshly critical of bush gephardt called for us 
leadership in a latterday marshall plan to write an end to the 
cold war 
he called for new investments in the soviet union by american 
business as well as government risk insurance and credit for 
investors he said the soviets should get most favored nation 
status and be allowed to import hightech items from the united 
states he advocated food aid for the soviets as well 
the proposal prompted bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
to label gephardt the maxwell smart of politics 
a lot has happened since then the cia in april issued a grim 
assessment of the soviet economy saying gorbachevs reforms were 
faltering and predicting an unstable year ahead at a conference a 
few days later a group of soviet economists said the cia picture 
was overly rosy 
then came the bushgorbachev summit in washington highlighting 
the stakes both sides attach to arms control agreements and ending 
with the signing of a new trade agreement between the two countries 
last week french president francois mitterrand proposed an 
allied rescue plan for gorbachev with about 20 billion in 
financial and technical aid to help stave off a soviet economic 
collapse the proposal was on the agenda when secretary of state 
james a baker iii went to europe last week and will be again at 
the houston economic summit of industrialized nations in july 
so while bush still may be reluctant to provide direct aid to 
the soviets he can no longer dismiss the idea that the turnaround 
has taken just three months is a measure of how fast the world 
continues to change 
for the president the challenge is to help guide any aid into 
channels that will encourage the economic reforms he believes are 
still needed rather than simply propping up a dying system bush 
also is concerned that outside aid could prolong soviet help to 
cuba and its other allies 
i want to see perestroika continue bush said last week 
im not saying were not interested but im saying there are 
some formidable obstacles 
but as events of the past three months illustrate things have a 
way of changing

two soviet cosmonauts will apparently be making an 
unscheduled space walk to try to repair a thermal blanket that has 
partially ripped apart and could interfere with their safe return 
to earth 
part of the thermal blanket has been flapping uselessly in space 
for months 
soviet officials have extended the stay of anatoly solovyev and 
alexander balandin aboard the orbiting space station mir until aug 
9 to give them extra time to make the repair the newspapers 
izvestia and trud report 
they had been scheduled to return july 30 after nearly six 
months in space 
it was the latest in a series of problems in the soviet unions 
manned space program which for decades has been a source of 
national pride for the past two years the program has been 
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions human error and budget 
cuts 
solovyev and balandin plan to take the previously unscheduled 
space walk on july 17 to repair a thermal blanket covering their 
soyuz tm9 capsule which is docked to mir 
the two newspapers said in reports saturday that the capsule 
while it is casting off could collide with the space station 
soviet officials have minimized the danger and izvestia said 
scientists in moscow determined the capsule could withstand the 
damage to its thermal blanket 
james oberg an american specialist on the soviet space program 
agreed 
i dont think theres danger i think theres anxiety over 
something more going wrong oberg said in a telephone interview 
sunday from his texas home 
nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule 
and a yardlong section is hanging off attached only on one side 
trud said 
the damage probably occurred during launch of the capsule on 
feb 11 izvestia quoted deputy flight director viktor blagov as

perjury trial links them to narcotics activity 
testimony enters its second week today in the mayors trial on 
three felony charges of perjury 10 misdemeanor charges of cocaine 
possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess 
cocaine he has pleaded innocent 
one potential witness is marlene johnson a top city official 
prosecution witness charles lewis testified last week that he used 
drugs with her and separately with barry in the virgin islands 
during 1988 
charles lewis is lying ms johnson retorted in a statement 
issued after his testimony i dont have any knowledge at all 
about mr lewis and drug use at all 
but an associate of ms johnson speaking on condition of 
anonymity said naturally shes nervous about the testimony 
unlike ms johnson who runs the citys alcohol beverage control 
commission most other potential prosecution witnesses have few or 
no government ties most are local businessmen restaurant owners 
or others who prosecutors believe are familiar with barrys social 
habits 
he had this other circle of friends a group separate from 
us one city official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
nobody up here on the fifth floor is expecting to be 
mentioned said one city aide referring to the floor in city 
hall where the mayors top aides work 
indeed lewis testified last week that barry was a bit 
surprised when city employee james mcwilliams was in lewis hotel 
room one night in december 1988 when the mayor arrived 
mcwilliams testified friday that although he was in the hotel 
room when the mayor and lewis used crack cocaine he lied about it 
to police afterward to protect barry 
law enforcement sources said that among those expected to 
testify are local restaurateur hussan muhammadi and neighborhood 
activist daniel butler 
muhammadi is expected to testify that barry paid regular visits 
to his georgetown restaurant to use cocaine occasionally twice a 
day or more the sources said butler a latenight companion of 
barrys over the past 18 months also is expected to testify that 
he saw barry use cocaine 
members of barrys roundtheclock security detail also are 
expected to testify particularly those who were assigned to barry 
during the time he was visiting lewis hotel room in december 1988 
several of the guards are apprehensive about sitting on the 
witness stand according to one member of the security detail who 
asked not to be identified 
one officer fred gaskins testified friday that while he 
delivered a sealed envelope from barry to lewis he did not believe 
that it contained money lewis has testified that the security 
guard delivered an envelope from barry that contained cash for 
lewis to buy crack cocaine 
the security guards are not expected to testify they saw barry 
use drugs law enforcement sources said instead prosecutors hope 
to use the guards detailed records of where they accompanied barry 
to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses such as lewis 
the public list of potential witnesses also includes former city 
consultant bettye smith smith along with local businessman jeff 
mitchell accompanied barry to the bahamas in 1987 the law 
enforcement sources said 
law enforcement sources say they expect ms smith to testify 
that she saw barry use drugs repeatedly during the trip she has 
not been charged with a crime 
willie davis a consultant and former aide to birmingham ala 
mayor richard arrington is a social companion of barry who may 
testify 
davis traveled from birmingham to washington repeatedly over the 
past 18 months top city government sources said davis frequently 
socialized with barry while doing business in the nations capital 
and the mayor sometimes sent his official limousine to area 
airports to pick him up city government sources said speaking on

candice fraiberger is her own best model tall 
slim and totally parisienne she is a beautiful blonde who 
specializes in dressy clothes to make others look beautiful too 
following a modest start four years ago fraiberger pronounced 
fraybearjay is gradually proving she has an authoritative 
flair for creating boutique clothes 
her new winter line unveiled last week showed wellcut 
sarongdraped skirts neat boleros with baroque appliqued 
embroidery over strapless dresses draped chiffons plenty of 
sequins and sparkle combined with lace satin taffeta and velvet 
the only criticism of these finished clothes is that some look a 
bit too fussy for the french but so far that doesnt matter 
because fraiberger is now betterknown in the united states than in 
france 
she regularly travels to posh american department stores and is 
wellknown in emporia like neimanmarcus saks and nordstroms 
her clothes lack the hardedge chic of styles by someone like 
jacqueline de ribes another society beauty designing her own label 
line whose stricter slinky silhouettes often recall yves saint 
laurent 
but the fraiberger line has more than a touch of haute couture 
and therefore class its made in workshops in the rue 
poissonniere the heart of the garment district east of central 
paris and is lovingly finished by seamstresses in the couture 
tradition appreciated by connoisseurs 
the luxury fabrics and detailing put them into a category 
superior to readytowear but in their pricerange of 2000 to 
6000 dollars per outfit the clothes are worth watching 
for price and quality they compare favorably with lines like 
christian lacroixs luxe whose price tags can be double or 
triple fraibergers 
indeed with feminine touches like flared umbrella skirts over 
crinolines and contrasts of pink and black velvet in embroidered 
dresses with decorated matadors boleros one sees a definite 
lacroix influence at work here 
personally i never have time to think about what i wear 
said ms fraiberger after her small showroom parade of winter 
cocktail and evening clothes im totally absorbed by what im 
making for others 
but she did look smashing in her blackandwhite cotton summer 
suit with beaded embroidered lapels fitted for elegance with just 
a hint of sexiness 
paradoxically this fortysomething lady who looks at least 
15 years younger has more fans in houston than in paris 
i had learned about clothes from working in retail in france 
but it was the americans who first enjoyed and ordered my styles 
when i started my own business said ms fraiberger 
married to an investment counselor and mother of two grown 
children ms fraiberger says she is financing her own business 
not backed by any grand consortium as many style creators are today 
sadly enough i dont even have a proper boutique yet in 
france she said adding that her friends and those in the know 
come to her showroom at rue aguesseau just around the corner from 
the fashionable faubourg sainthonore 
however shes selling well in styleconscious countries like 
japan and germany and is at last attracting favorable comments 
from the french fashion press as well 
i think the clothes look very wellmade said christine 
marais of french harpers bazaar 
the feel of dressiness is quite american observed laurence 
beurdeley of the glossy fashion magazine lofficiel de la mode 
ms fraiberger says she believes in dressing up rather than 
down and is proud to look spiffy as a bandbox herself 
i think the french are wrong to affect the casual styles seen 
so much on the streets here she says it shows a sloppiness of 
mind i understand tourists wearing practical shoes for 
sightseeing but i think women should do their best to be feminine 
and elegant

the gop economist running against new york 
gov mario cuomo was a political ally of president nixon but white 
house aides were wary of his economic views in one case calling 
them almost pathological nixonera records show 
pierre rinfret 66 was virtually a political unknown when 
republicans tapped him last month to take on cuomo but he was an 
outspoken economic adviser during the nixon years 
nixon himself had mixed reactions to rinfrets economic advice 
according to documents in the nixon presidential materials project 
at the national archives 
between 1969 and nixons resignation in 1974 rinfret frequently 
sent economic advice to the president in the early years nixon 
wrote back often rebutting rinfrets assertions but later 
rinfrets views appeared to get less attention 
last week after rinfret claimed he had been offered three 
cabinet posts by the nixon administration nixon issued a terse 
statement saying only that he had hoped rinfret would join my 
administration as a member of the council of economic advisers or 
later as a member of the cabinet 
in june 1969 nixon wrote in the margin of a paper mentioning 
rinfret that i have great regard for rinfret personally 
but one month later paul w mccracken nixons chairman of the 
council of economic advisers sent nixon a memo saying he had 
reservations about inviting pierre rinfret down for any kind of 
consultative discussions 
mccracken said rinfrets july 3 1969 economic newsletter was 
almost pathological devoid of anything which could be considered 
competent economic analysis 
the newsletter had accused the nixon administration of 
fostering creating condoning aiding abetting and developing 
the current mood of economic and financial terror 
but nixon continued to meet and correspond with rinfret and 
later named him chief economic spokesman for his 1972 reelection 
campaign against george mcgovern 
rinfrets appointment was announced under conditions he 
dictated according to a july 1972 memo from white house aide 
patrick e odonnell 
mr rinfret drives a hard bargain odonnell wrote in a memo 
to charles colson special counsel to the president he insists 
on a formal announcement from the white house 
the white house then arranged a meeting at which rinfret would 
be photographed with the president to provide the credentials he 
needs and wants colson wrote nixon 
nixon and his white house staff apparently were satisfied with 
rinfrets work 
rinfret is probably our best economic spokesman because he 
uses phrases people understand and our speech writers should 
take a course from him staff secretary bruce kehrli wrote to 
counsel john ehrlichman in october 1972 
indeed rinfret demonstrated to his political masters that he 
was not above subverting his economic beliefs in the name of 
political expediency 
according to an october 1972 memo to colson from aide steve 
karalekas rinfret was worried about a political answer he had 
given the new york times to head off criticism from mcgovern 
rinfret expressed concern his answer would upset the 
administrations economic team but he did it for our political 
benefit not from the standpoint of pure economics karalekas 
wrote

first they said you should be able to 
beat up a flag burner for just 25 then they said abortion should 
be a crime again 
in between they tried to shield young eyes and ears from the 
seamier side of rock 
for this louisiana lawmakers are getting bashed by womens 
groups civil libertarians record producers editorial writers and 
others 
the louisiana legislatures actions not only hurt the state 
they detract from the entire southeast which otherwise has made 
great gains in shedding negative stereotypes the atlanta 
journalconstitution lamented 
a fascinating illustration of the dark age that some states 
will try to plunge into headlong the american civil liberties 
union told the national law journal 
if you have a working uterus and are planning to travel to 
louisiana dont go is a joke making the rounds in washington 
according to robin rothrock president of louisiana league of women 
voters 
the independent a london newspaper quoted journalist aj 
leiblings characterization of louisiana as the westernmost of 
the arab states 
the rebukes followed passage by the state house recently of 
three bills former ku klux klan leader david dukes measure to 
weaken affirmative action an antiabortion bill with no exceptions 
for victims of rape or incest and a bill to lower the penalty for 
battery in cases where the victim is a flag burner 
also drawing criticism is a housepassed bill approved by a 
senate committee that would require retailers to label recordings 
dealing with suicide drugs incest or ritualistic behavior the 
bill would also require retailers to keep the offending recordings 
out of sight of minors 
the national academy of recording arts and sciences said it will 
no longer consider new orleans as a site for the grammy hall of 
fame if the bill becomes law the national association of recording 
merchandisers said it will abandon plans to hold its 1992 
convention in new orleans if the measure passes 
it seems they are running the peril of appearing so regressive 
and so repressive that they render louisiana irrelevant to 
mainstream america as a place to do business said linda dorian 
executive director of the national federation of business and 
professional womens clubs the 120000member organization said it 
is reconsidering new orleans as its 1995 convention site 
duke himself has drawn a lot of the criticism the st 
petersburg times said his run for us senate has made many 
american racists feel respectable again 
not all of the criticism is coming from outside the state 
those are highprofile bills that we shouldnt be debating 
said democratic state sen jon johnson 
but democratic rep james david cain asked about ridicule of 
his bill lowering the penalty for beating a flag burner said i 
dont particularly worry about it the current penalty is up to 
six months in jail and a 500 fine 
cain said the journalconstitutions editorial was just part of 
atlantas competition for business and convention trade with new 
orleans he added if none of these bills were in we would be 
bashed for some other reason 
senate president sammy nunez a democrat said criticism of the 
legislature may be valid to some extent but premature 
if all these things become law then probably some of these 
things would be justified but theyre not law and you cant stop 
people from introducing bills in either body he said 
nunez said he believes the controversial bills wont pass or 
will be amended significantly 
gov buddy roemer has said he will veto any abortion bill that 
doesnt include rape and incest exceptions a position that 
doesnt satisfy womens groups louisiana has few restrictions on 
abortion about 15000 are performed annually 
roemer has promised to veto dukes bill and said he has 
reservations about cains bill and the record labeling measure 
he isnt standing around and letting outsiders pick on louisiana 
either 
its our state and we have the right to build it and hold it 
as we see fit roemer said last week i wouldnt take that away 
from the legislature 
as for the criticism from outside roemer said frankly i 
dont care

private farm groups as well as government 
officials are wading through the settling dust to see exactly what 
is in the compromise 1990 farm bill completed last week after weeks 
of wrangling and compromise 
the massive bill changes price supports on wheat and feed grains 
and fine tunes many other areas of th nations farm law but it 
will take experts who were not in on drafting the bill several days 
to decide how the changes affect various sectors of the farm 
community 
the members of the committee meanwhile are either 
congratulating themselves for finally reaching a compromise or 
preparing for a fight once the bill gets to the floor probably in 
july 
the house version of the farm bill also is expected to be 
debated on the floor in july 
sen thomas harkin diowa for example has already promised an 
effort on the floor to raise price supports 
others on the committee say the compromise bill agreed to 
thursday on a 154 vote is the best that can be accomplished given 
intense competition among various arm interests 
sen richard lugar rind who wanted to freeze target prices 
loan rates and acreage reduction said he was satisfied 
sen bob kerrey dneb who led the negotiations for the plains 
states senators to raise target prices and loan rates for 
commodities said he thought the result was a balanced approach 
i think it is a good bill said kerrey we got a 
compromise and its out there its fair 
he said it provides protection farmers wanted though its 
packaged differently than the original proposals 
sen thomas daschle dsd said he couldnt be as enthusiastic 
as kerrey because conditions for farmers in his state are worse 
it depends on your crop mix said daschle who voted against 
the bill the degree to which you are not farm bill dependent is 
the degree to which you like this bill my farmers are not going to 
greet this with any kind of enthusiasm 
kerrey said he knew some would try to change it on the floor 
but said that was less important than whether the bush 
administration was planning an attack on the proposals 
immediately after the bill was approved by the senate 
agriculture committee bruce gardner assistant secretary for 
economics said he didnt understand the rationale for some of the 
provisions in the commodities section 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter had no immediate comment 
and other department officials spent friday reviewing the bill 
officials at the american farm bureau federation the nations 
largest farm organization also were studying the commodities 
section of bill 
it would make the current farm program in relation to wheat 
and feed grains more complicated and were not sure in doing that 
whether it really helps farmers said john datt executive 
director 
larry gray of the national family farm coalition said his 
organization opposed the wheat and feed grains section and is 
trying to work with senators to seek changes on the floor 
the programs devised in the house and senate are full 
production programs with systematic reduction of prices received in 
the market place said gray its a scenario that virtually 
assures the loss of family farm operations the megafarms who can 
afford to produce at a loss can outlive the family farms and corner 
the market 
the bill continues the philosophy of the 1985 law both the 
administration and members of congress have said farmers wanted 
only minor adjustments however advocates for small and 
mediumsized farms say the law favors corporations and exporters 
and will eventually lead to demise of smaller operations and the 
buffer they provide against monopoly control of food prices

it is a poor paraphrase of marc antonys 
tribute to julius caesar to note that the evil that cockroaches do 
lives after them 
but unlike shakespeares famous eulogy there is no good buried 
with cockroaches the agriculture department says 
in fact scientists have found that the dried particles of 
longdead cockroaches can affect people who are allergic to the 
repugnant insects 
cockroach exoskeletons shells feces blood and digestive 
enzymes contain proteins that cause allergy these proteins linger 
for a long time even after the insects are gone 
a home with no current cockroach problem could harbor allergy 
producing cockroach parts from decades past said entomologist 
richard brenner of the departments agricultural research service 
people simply cannot continue to view cockroaches as just a nasty 
nuisance 
the agency in a report cited studies showing that 10 million 
to 15 million americans are allergic to cockroaches reactions can 
range from a runny nose and skin irritation to difficulty in 
breathing shock and in rare cases death 
studies by bann kang chief of allergy and clinical immunology 
at the university of kentucky show that about 61 percent of 
asthmatics are sensitive to cockroaches the report said 
brenner who works at the usdas insect laboratory in 
gainesville fla stirred interest in health implications of 
cockroach infestations in a 1986 seminar held at the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn 
since then brenner has coordinated a national research team 
looking at ways of preventing allergies related to cockroaches 
those include medical professionals human behavior specialists 
home construction experts and entomologists 
the evidence suggests that an allergy developed from one type of 
cockroach such as the german or brownbanded types commonly found 
in apartments can condition a person to become allergic to another 
and since crabs lobster and shellfish are from the same 
group as cockroaches arthropods cockroach allergy could possibly 
lead to a shellfish allergy the report said 
brenner said that is why prevention of the first allergy is so 
important prevention starts in the homes construction and how 
people live he said 
one problem is that homes have become increasingly airtight in 
the last 30 years as families and builders strive to become more 
energyefficient 
a home of the future built with cockroaches as well as families 
in mind could include 
air flow in attics and wall areas where roaches tend to gather 
experiments with a divided attic showed almost all roaches moved to 
the side with no air flow 
insulation impregnated with repellent developed by usda 
scientists in tests the repellents worked so well that 
cockroaches would rather stay out under bright lights with no 
water and starve to death than go near them brenner said 
home floor plans that dont accommodate cockroach survival 
levels of moisture air flows and temperatures are important 
factors in design 
dehumidifiers that remove moisture without reducing heat in 
cold months or cool air in warm months research shows cockroaches 
survive best in moist environments 
an air filtering system to remove cockroach parts from the air 
thus eliminating those as a cause of allergies

an agricultural commodity group says failure 
to continue chinas most favored nation trade status would hurt 
us farmers 
the national association of wheat growers urged renewal of 
chinas trade position last week at a house ways and means 
committee trade subcommittee hearing 
countries having mfn status are charged lower tariff rates 
on products exported to the united states 
ron rivinius president of the association said if china is 
turned down for mfn renewal it will result in immediate retaliation 
against imports of us wheat 
the loss of the chinese market would result in a steep decline 
in us wheat sales and a severe drop in farm income he said 
rivinius said no other wheat competitor canada australia 
argentina and the european economic community is considering a 
change in chinas mfn status 
if we abdicate our position as the major wheat exporter to 
china by unilaterally canceling its mfn status it will be

a study financed by the meat industry says 
consumers may have a false perception about the nutritional value 
of bacon 
the findings suggest most consumers would be surprised at the 
difference between their perceptions and reality said pat pines 
vice president of the american meat institute for the bacon 
industry it shows a need to do a better job of educating consumers 
for example a threeslice cooked serving of bacon contains no 
more fat or cholesterol than an ounce of cheese the trade group 
said and while most people consider three slices of bacon a 
realistic serving size they view an ounce of cheese as 
significantly less than a realistic serving size 
the study was conducted for the institute by directions research 
inc of cincinnati ohio which interviewed 800 grocery shoppers 
and 500 randomly selected bacon users

susan allen still gets really sweaty hands 
when she talks about the series of obscene telephone calls she 
received from the president of american university 
i dont trust anybody anymore allen a day care provider 
said 
her harasser richard berendzen resigned as president of 
american university and pleaded guilty to two counts of making 
obscene telephone calls 
but that wasnt enough for allen 
determined to fight back she established a hot line to help 
people like herself who are the victims of obscene phone calls her 
tollfree number was connected two days after berendzens guilty 
plea 
i started the group to help others get a support network 
allen said its a place for someone to get in touch with someone 
who knows the laws 
the nonprofit getcha group energized to terminate caller 
harassment and abuse will focus on strengthening the penalties 
and laws against making obscene phone calls allen said 
right now its a misdemeanor she said i want that 
changed to a felony after the third time 
allen is outraged that berendzen didnt go to jail for making 
nearly 30 obscene phone calls to her and 10 to her husband within a 
twoweek period allen said shes still frightened of him 
berendzen 51 was sentenced in may to 30 days in jail for each 
count but the sentence was suspended pending good behavior and 
continued outpatient treatment at johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore 
according to his psychiatrists berendzens compulsive phone 
calls over a twoyear period were the result of severe sexual and 
emotional abuse as a child 
virginia state police spokeswoman lucy caldwell said the hot 
line might convince some victims to prosecute their harassers 
hopefully it will bring attention to the problem she said 
adding that victims no longer have to be quiet because theres 
someplace to turn 
since installing her line allen has received almost 500 calls 
from people around the country who have experienced obscene phone 
harassment several of the calls she received were obscene 
allen said many of the callers heard about getcha during one of 
her several recent appearances on national television programs 
they wont go to work or to the store alone she said 
they cant sleep because their callers call them all night 
allen also has a post office box for inquiries she has received 
some obscene letters and dead flowers but overall she said she 
has been inundated with letters from people seeking help 
although she considers her hot line successful allens efforts 
to solicit donations have not gone as well 
the public is real willing to receive information but is not 
willing to support the group she said my goal was to help 
other people to keep the issue in the publics eye i thought 
it would be received better than it has been 
so far allen has received 18 in donations and has spent nearly 
900 of her own money for getcha if donations dont start coming 
in allen said she might have to drop the tollfree line but she 
said shell keep the post office box 
this is a lifetime venture she said 
allen plans to apply for grants from the national organization 
for women and the government to support her group and to lobby 
congress for tougher legislation against obscene callers

nelson mandelas plans to visit with 
longshoremen in california and auto workers in detroit stem from 
the us labor movements 35year campaign against racism in south 
africa 
mandelas tour of the united states includes several visits with 
american labor officials whose fight against racial injustice in 
south africa dates back to the 1950s 
today the 71yearold leader of the african national congress 
was meeting with aflcio president lane kirkland following sessions 
with president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
on thursday he is to address the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees at the government workers 
convention in miami that group has been particularly supportive of 
antiapartheid policies labor officials said 
mandelas planned detroit visit to auto workers may be in 
recognition of the decades of help from the united autoworkers 
union labor officials said mandela also plans to meet with 
longshoremen in oakland calif the aflcio said 
uaw president owen bieber and afscme president gerald mcentee 
are among several us labor leaders who have been arrested since 
1984 in antiapartheid protests at the south african embassy in 
washington 
the aflcio which represents 90 unions and 142 million union 
members has been helping black trade unionists in south africa 
since 1956 when it first condemned government racist policies a 
year later the aflcio provided an initial 50000 to help african 
trade unions 
over the past three decades the financial support has grown 
american unions also have sent representatives to south africa to 
help trade unionists organize and the aflcio has sponsored black 
trade unionists travel to the united states 
the federation founded an africanamerican labor center in 1965 
to expand its efforts in africa in 1978 it was calling for us 
corporations to divest themselves of south african affiliates 
during the 1980s while president reagan was reversing an 
embargo on military sales to south africa the aflcio continued to 
press for economic sanctions

barring a lastminute change of heart a 
mass murderer who has refused to make any attempt to save his life 
will be put to death by injection tonight in arkansas second 
execution in 26 years 
r gene simmons 49 was scheduled to die at 9 pm he was 
convicted in the slayings of 16 people among them were 14 family 
members his wife his seven children and their spouses and 
children killed during the 1987 christmas holidays 
his execution would be the states second in a week john edward 
swindler died in the electric chair june 18 for the 1976 murder of 
a policeman previously arkansas had not had an execution since 
1964 
simmons would also be the first person put to death by injection 
in arkansas which changed its method of execution after swindlers 
sentencing 
he has refused to file any appeals saying let the torture 
and suffering in me end 
but he can still appeal up until moments before his execution 
two attempts to intervene on his behalf failed one by arkansas 
churches for life which won a stay that was lifted in may and one 
by a fellow death row inmate the us supreme court ruled in april 
that the inmate has no standing 
the bodies of his relatives were found in and around the family 
home near dover after simmons went on a shooting rampage on dec 
28 1987 in nearby russellville killing two people and wounding 
four 
since his arrest simmons has offered no explanation 
the execution tonight is for the shooting rampage although he 
was also condemned for the family slayings in a separate trial 
sunday was the last day he could have visitors other than his 
lawyers or a spiritual adviser the inmate declined any visits 
hes simply not making conversation with staff he would best 
be described as having as little contact with anyone as possible 
prison spokesman david white said 
thats not any different from his demeanor throughout his 
incarceration

monetary union of the two germanys is expected to 
foster growth in the west german economy and help rebuild the east 
but the cost may be high 
it probably means higher inflation interest rates and taxes in 
the west and business failures lost jobs and higher prices in the 
east how much of each remains a question 
the economic merger takes place july 1 when the west german 
mark becomes east germanys currency and east germany abandons its 
communist economics for western capitalism 
all in all its a good chance for the west part of germany to 
continue its performance said ulrich hombrecher an economist at 
westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale in duesseldorf 
a report by the national institute of economic and social 
research in britain said the merger is likely to provide a 
renewed stimulus to the west german economy 
the union will enlarge west germanys economy by an estimated 5 
to 10 percent but few statistics are available on the east german 
economy 
we have so little information about the east german businesses 
and economy hombrecher it really is a problem 
west germany already benefits from east german demand for its 
cars and consumer electronics and consumer spending is likely to 
increase after east german savings are converted into west german 
marks 
experts say unification could help germany sustain growth at the 
current west german level of above 3 percent but no one has any 
real idea how much the east germans will buy 
that is one of the great unknowns at the moment said mark 
houghtonberry executive director of foreign exchange trading at 
goldman sachs and co in london 
business investment should rise and west germany will gain 
cheaper east german labor which should slow wage increases and 
boost corporate profits the experts predict 
inflation is the big fear the rate in west germany is an 
enviable 23 percent but printing new deutsche marks to convert 
east german marks will swell the west germany money supply by 10 
percent 
a larger money supply does not disturb stephen king 
international economist with the london investment firm james capel 
and co you need the 10 percent to cope with the 10 percent 
added in gnp he said 
another risk for west germany is higher interest rates now at 8 
to 9 percent 
its central bank the bundesbank is expected to continue a 
tight monetary policy but rates could be pushed higher by large 
demands for credit to rebuild the east 
hombrecher predicts monetary unification will add 1 percent to 
west german economic growth inflation will move up to 35 percent 
and interest rates will rise to just over 9 percent 
he sees the 80 billion trade surplus shrinking by 7 percent and 
the 50 billion budget deficit soaring by 30 percent 
higher taxes might be necessary to finance east germanys 
reconstruction and povide help for the unemployed whose ranks are 
sure to swell 
estimates of how many east german jobs will be lost range from 
300000 to 3 million the actual number has risen so far this year 
from 20000 to 130000 
hombrecher predicts unemployment will reach 11 percent west 
germanys rate is a low 63 percent 
direct west german aid to the east is expected to be about 20 
billion a year in the near future 
east germans can expect cheaper durable goods construction 
retail and wholesale sectors and tourism could flourish factories 
will get the newest technology and roads will be rebuilt 
in the beginning east german prices for housing food and 
public transport are expected to rise because state subsidies have 
kept them artificially low 
some east germans worry about westerners snapping up stateowned 
businesses property and workers cheaply east germans earn 
onethird to half the average west german monthly wage of 2020 
but west german productivity is three times as high

a ruling by a federal judge is leaving in 
limbo a plan to crack down on accused drug dealers nationwide by 
throwing them out of public housing they rent 
federal marshals had been poised in 22 cities today to raid 
apartments in housing projects where the lessor is a suspected drug 
dealer who faces possible prosecution for at least two felonies 
but in a ruling issued late friday us district judge richard 
l williams ordered the federal government to give tenants proper 
notice and an opportunity to be heard in court before seizing 
their leases 
his initial order earlier in the week had applied only to the 
richmond area 
the judges expanded order left the plan in limbo 
the new york times quoted frank keating general counsel for the 
department of housing and urban development as saying agency 
officials had yet to discuss what to do in light of the order he 
said they considered filing an emergency appeal today 
even if officials did not immediately evict the targeted 
tenants they could be arrested and put on notice they were in 
peril of losing their housing keating was quoted as saying in 
the times monday editions if it was up to me i think we should 
go in and make these arrests and crack in there 
under the program first announced last month by housing 
secretary jack kemp the tenant and his or her family could be 
kicked out of the apartment even if the person has not yet been 
convicted of a drug crime 
the government calls the actions leasehold forfeitures not 
evictions the plan already has stirred up a legal challenge in one 
city 
the forfeiture of publichousing leases by such accused drug 
dealers is specifically authorized by assetforfeiture provisions 
of the 1988 antidrug abuse act government officials say the same 
provisions enable federal prosecutors to seize boats cars and cash 
of drug dealers awaiting trial 
in this case the lease is the asset to be seized 
the raids were scheduled to be conducted in cities where 
authorities have identified drug dealing in housing projects as a 
significant problem 
the targeted housing projects were in some of the nations 
largest cities new york los angeles chicago as well as 
smaller municipalities such as chandler ariz tacoma wash and 
frederick md according to a list obtained by the associated 
press bob nipp a spokesman for the department of housing and 
urban development declined to comment on the planned raids when 
kemp first announced the plan he declined to identify the cities 
where housing projects would be raided 
civil libertarians have criticized the planned raids saying 
they would violate the principle that a person is innocent of 
criminal wrongdoing until proven guilty 
under guidelines adopted by hud and the justice department only 
apartments that are notorious and open sites of drug distribution 
and leased by known drug dealers would have been raided officials 
said 
the guidelines also state that authorities should have proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the leaseholder committed at least 
two felony drug crimes and will face prosecution said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it was not known whether authorities also planned to serve 
search warrants to seek possible evidence of drug activity 
the plan called for using local social service agencies to 
relocate children and elderly people who would have be displaced 
from their homes by the raids officials said 
among the other cities in which public housing was targeted 
were washington atlanta dallas baltimore hartford conn 
newark nj indianapolis flint mich charleston sc macon 
ga el paso texas omaha portland ore and st louis mo

winnie mandelas first event in the nations 
capital was at a church that greatly influenced her grandmothers 
views on apartheid 
mrs mandela told a wildly cheering crowd in the historic 
metropolitan african methodist episcopal church on sunday that the 
ame denomination was one of the first churches in our country 
my grandmother was a worshipper in the ame church she told me 
it was the only church that did not practice apartheid she said 
noting that the ame continues to be involved in blacks struggle 
for freedom in south africa 
mrs mandela accompanied her husband nelson to washington as 
part of his eightcity us tour she had struggled to keep alive 
the antiapartheid movement during the 27 years he was imprisoned 
in south africa 
i look forward to the day when we can hoist the flag of the 
african national congress she said standing next to an anc flag 
of green black and gold 
the metropolitan ame church was used by black leaders such as 
frederick douglass and dr martin luther king jr to sway support 
for the us civil rights struggle 
when mrs mandela arrived at the church the crowd roared and 
began chanting mandela 
they shouted support when she implored them we need your 
prayers for the struggle for freedom by black south africans 
they burst into wild laughter applause and cheers when she said 
we need you to help us teach us how you tolerated racism 
she said the anc was peaceful until forced to violence by the 
south african government and that its leaders are speaking a 
peace language again but she stressed that it is not easy to 
walk that path of peace because many of the younger people are 
ready for immediate change 
with her remarks constantly interrupted by applause mrs 
mandela said the anc wants to negotiate with president fw de 
klerk from a position of strength we want him to know that we 
got your footsteps behind us

the national police commander says israel 
will respond with severity and more palestinians could be killed 
if stonethrowing riots persist in arab areas of jerusalem 
late sunday police lifted a threeday curfew on three arab 
sections of the city after an appeal from mayor teddy kollek a 
political moderate 
the 20000 palestinian residents of the jerusalem neighborhoods 
of silwan abu tor and ras elamud were placed under curfew after 
rioting last week in which two palestinians were shot to death by 
police 
also sunday defense minister moshe arens approved the formation 
of civil guard units made up of jewish settlers in the occupied 
west bank a move condemned by some as certain to fuel violence 
between settlers and arabs 
the moves came amid increasing friction between jews and arabs 
in jerusalem and in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
police spokesman uzi sandouri said about 45 suspected rioters 
were detained during the curfew 
police commissioner yaacov turner said sunday that if rioting 
persists we will respond with severity there are limits to 
a capability to exercise restraint 
if those who live in abu tor ras elamud and silwan dont 
catch the idea that there is a limit and if they dont absorb 
this then the significance will be that there will be more 
killed turner said 
incidents of violence have increased between jews and arabs in 
east jerusalem annexed by israel after its capture along with the 
west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war 
on sunday 200 israelis hurled stones at homes in the arab 
village of dahyat albarid and at cars driven by arabs after 
palestinians stoned an israeli bus on its way to the nearby jewish 
suburb of neve yaacov police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd 
police reports and israel radio said 
the radio said at least 10 protesters were detained 
the intensity of violence has been unusual for jerusalem which 
has been calmer than the west bank and gaza during the 30month 
palestinian uprising 
of the 719 palestinians killed by israelis during the revolt 
eight have been from jerusalem at least six of the 45 israeli 
victims have been killed in jerusalem 
jerusalem is home to about 300000 jews and 140000 arabs there 
are 17 million palestinians and 70000 jewish settlers in the 
occupied territories

after a week of protests on the streets 
outside a world conference on aids activists took their complaints 
indoors and drowned out the closing speech by health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan 
sullivan delivered his 20minute address at the sixth 
international aids conference as several hundred protesters sunday 
pelted him with wads of paper blew whistles and air horns and 
shouted no more words we want action 
its too bad his speech wasnt heard but it was important 
that he was here said dr anthony s fauci the governments top 
aids researcher 
rose okello a health educator from uganda who attended the 
conference said the secretary did what he had to do and the 
activists did well in expressing their concerns it was a form of 
dialogue 
sullivans speech at the moscone center closed the fiveday 
conference attended by more than 10000 scientists and public 
officials from around the world 
thousands of activists had also converged on san francisco for 
demonstrations against government policies on aids nearly 300 were 
arrested in protests outside the convention hall 
activists have accused the government of dragging out efforts to 
find new treatments and offer them to people infected with hiv the 
virus that causes aids 
demonstrators didnt disrupt conference sessions until sunday 
the same day as san franciscos annual gaylesbian freedom day 
celebrated by thousands of marchers it was one of many gaypride 
observances around the country sunday 
with a line of police standing between the podium and 
fistshaking protesters sullivan asked for cooperation 
tolerance understanding and caring 
we must find the ways and means to work together for the 
benefit of people with aids and hiv infection throughout the 
world he said 
demonstrators stood on chairs at the front of the big conference 
hall chanting get off the stage 
todd weisse a member of the new york chapter of the aids 
coalition to unleash power or act up was in the front row of the 
protesters 
our purpose was to stop the administrations empty rhetoric 
he said louis sullivan has the power to do something much more 
than is being done he said 
one item in sullivans speech might have won applause from 
protesters had they heard it sullivans opposition to legislation 
that would let employers fire workers in the food service industry 
who are infected with the aids virus 
many attending the final meeting were upset by the disruption 
thank you for supporting free speech one delegate shouted 
at protesters as they left the hall 
its sad said dr james curran head of the aids program at 
the centers for disease control its an example of the 
fragmentation of the efforts that i most fear in the 1990s sick 
versus well gay versus straight 
but fauci said the demonstration would not interfere with 
growing cooperation between scientists and activists there has 
been a movement of people who realize both sides have a lot to 
contribute he said 
activists have persuaded federal regulators to let infected 
people take experimental aids drugs even before they are approved 
for routine use 
fauci director of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases and head of the federal office of aids 
research was warmly received in his closing speech before the same 
audience 
activists are mistaken when they assume or at least publicly 
state that scientists do not care about them he told the 
gathering most scientists care deeply and are employing all of 
their energies and talents to accomplish the same goals as the 
activists are trying to accomplish 
fauci outlined research objectives for the decade and noted that 
several promising new drugs are being tested 
in another closing speech dr lars o kallings of stockholm 
president of the international aids society attacked laws 
restricting travel by people infected with the aids virus as 
shameful he blamed political bigotry 
kallings did not specifically mention the united states which 
has restrictions on aidsinfected visitors because of those rules 
the international society has threatened to cancel the next 
international aids conference planned in this country the 1992 
meeting in boston 
sullivan did not mention the immigration policy

childrens stories and sang childrens songs 
ms edelman said the rally was intended for families to have 
some fun together on a sunday afternoon but she also focused on 
the more serious concerns many parents have about inadequate child 
care 
more than half the mothers of children under 2 work outside the 
home and millions of parents have a hard time getting proper day 
care for their children yet the men in congress and in the white 
house are still dickering about technicalities on a child care 
assistance bill she said 
the house and senate have agreed on parts of a 175 billion 
child care assistance bill but differences remain on some elements 
dealing with tax credits

the head of the us civil rights commission 
says he had been unable to persuade president bush that a proposed 
civil rights bill would not lead to racial hiring quotas 
but arthur fletcher said he hoped bush would back away from a 
threat to veto the civil rights act of 1990 unless it is modified 
fletcher who appeared on nbctvs meet the press program 
with jesse jackson was asked whether he believed bush would veto 
the legislation fletcher responded i hope not but he added 
i cant tell you what the president is going to do 
the bill is designed to overcome a series of supreme court 
decisions last year that made it more difficult for workers to sue 
employers for alleged job discrimination 
but the bush administration has sought changes in the measure 
the bill may be brought up for senate consideration this week a 
similar version still awaits judiciary committee approval before 
being cleared for debate in the house 
the administration has claimed that the bill as drafted would 
in effect force businesses to resort to hiring quotas to reduce 
their exposure to lawsuits backers deny that the bill requires 
quotas either directly or indirectly 
the white house has said it is willing to compromise although 
some republican leaders have expressed doubts that an accord can be 
reached 
but fletcher appointed by bush in february said the commission 
voted 71 last week to support the legislation however the 
commission wants included a statement that there is no intention to 
force quotas 
fletcher said he had tried to convince administration officials 
that the bill as drafted would not do so 
i obviously havent convinced them yet but we dont know 
the language in the bill yet when we finally see what that says 
well know whether there is a propensity for quotas or not he 
said

the withdrawal of thousands of soviet troops from 
eastern europe has exacerbated a housing crunch back home further 
lowering morale in a demoralized officer corps and causing friction 
with local authorities 
soviet authorities had planned to relocate many of the troops in 
the byelorussian republic which borders poland 
but that plan has upset local authorities who already face 
problems housing families evacuated from their homes after the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear accident 
it is astonishing that the decision to relocate troops to 
byelorussia was made without an agreement with the leadership of 
byelorussia the soviet army newspaper red star said in its 
saturday editions under the headline where will the officers 
live 
the eventual withdrawal of more than 500000 soviet troops from 
eastern europe initiated by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
two years ago and accelerated by the collapse of communist regimes 
in the region has created a housing crunch that worries top 
generals 
the sudden need to house more returning troops has run smack 
into a national shortage of civilian apartments and homes retired 
maj gen ivan lebedev said in an interview 
it is one of the most complicated questions facing the 
military lebedev said and is making it harder to attract young 
men into the officer corps the corps already faces a shrinking 
budget weapons cuts pacifist movements in the baltic and 
caucasian republics and criticism in the press 
defense minister marshal dmitri t yazov in a june 3 article on 
military reform published in the communist party daily pravda 
cited housing of relocated troops as one of the major tasks in 
wider military reforms 
the families of about 173000 soviet officers lack adequate 
housing and the withdrawal of more troops from czechoslovakia 
hungary and poland will create problems for 25000 more families 
pravda quoted col n karasyev as saying it identified him as 
director of social sciences for the main political directorate of 
the soviet army and navy 
this figure helps explain the following fact in the current 
year 17500 officers applied to resign from the armed services 
and analysis has shown that they were far from the worst 
officers deputy director of military cadres col gen vf 
arapov was quoted as saying in the june 13 edition of red star 
the red star report did not suggest that housing problems will 
interfere with the military pullout that began with gorbachevs 
announcement in december 1988 that he planned to withdraw 10 
percent of the estimated 565000 soviet troops stationed in other 
warsaw pact countries 
in the last six months the pace of the pullout has quickened as 
both hungary and czechoslovakia have demanded the withdrawal of all 
120000 soviet troops from their territory by mid1991 and have 
indicated they might pull out of the kremlinled warsaw pact 
of 50000 troops stationed in hungary at the beginning of the 
year more than 20000 have been withdrawn with the last to be 
pulled out over the next 12 months the state news agency tass 
quoted the commander of the forces col gen matveei burlakov as 
saying in a dispatch sunday 
an even bigger crunch is expected after german unification with 
the anticipated gradual pullout of the 380000 soviet troops in 
east germany poland is also expected to demand the withdrawal of 
the 40000 soviet troops from its territory once its fears about 
german unification are put to rest 
the returning troops are not exactly being welcomed with open 
arms 
on thursday the commander of the byelorussian military 
district col gen a kostenko met with local deputies to the 
national legislature and members of the parliamentary commission on 
defense and national security 
he was told that regional authorities could not find room for 
the dislocated soldiers red star reported 
the byelorussian leaders told soviet lawmakers that there was 
a complicated housing situation in the republic thousands of 
families suffering from the tragedy at the chernobyl atomic energy 
station are awaiting relocation from the disaster zone 
one of four reactors at chernobyl in the northern ukraine 
suffered a partial meltdown in late april 1986 and winds carried 
the radiation across byelorussia forcing the evacuation of 
thousands of residents 
many still await permanent housing

rural alaskans cherished right to live 
off the land is at the center of a dispute that has the federal 
government ready to take over game management in most of the state 
because of an alaska supreme court ruling that put state and 
federal laws at odds the government plans to assume responsibility 
for game management july 1 in the twothirds of the state it owns 
in hopes of regaining control the legislature was to convene in 
special session today to consider an amendment to the constitution 
that would ensure rural alaskans continue to have first crack at 
fish and game for subsistence 
an amendment must pass both houses of the legislature by a 
twothirds margin and be put to the voters a process that could 
take months or years 
gov steve cowper a democrat and us sen ted stevens 
ralaska met with lawmakers sunday to seek support for the 
amendment 
an estimated 110000 alaskans venture into the wild to hunt 
fish and gather plants for food 
for less than half of them indians aleuts and eskimos its 
the core of their existence said julie kitka president of the 
alaska federation of natives 
the dispute began in december when the alaska supreme court 
ruled that part of a state law that limits subsistence activities 
to rural residents discriminates against urbanites 
but a federal law passed in 1980 requires a rural preference 
five federal land agencies plan to assume game management of 
alaskas federal land to protect the rural subsistence right 
the takeover is expected to lead to confusion among hunters 
faced with differing regulations on alaskas patchwork of public 
lands 
its the worst jigsaw you can imagine said bruce batten 
spokesman for the us fish and wildlife service

180 percent to 3112419 points following fridays loss of 
39270 points volume on the first section was estimated at 300

closing out a short and caustic 
campaign teacherlobbyist paul hubbert and attorney general don 
siegelman meet on tuesday in a democratic runoff for the right to 
challenge republican gov guy hunt 
hubbert led a sixcandidate field in the june 5 primary with 32 
percent of the vote siegelman who got 25 percent as the 
runnerup has sought to close the gap with negative ads 
if there was a law that guaranteed truth in advertising in a 
political campaign then don siegelman would be on his way to 
jail said hubbert 
the candidates have accused each other of racist tactics 
siegelman has depicted his opponent as a man opening classroom 
doors to child molesters while hubbert has exploited siegelmans 
admission he smoked marijuana in college 
whoever wins the democratic nomination once tantamount to 
winning the governors office in a state long dominated by the 
democratic party will merely earn a longshot chance against hunt 
hunt a preacherfarmer who in 1986 became alabamas first gop 
governor in 112 years thanks to a split in democratic ranks is 
favored in the polls over either hubbert or siegelman 
a poll commissioned by the anniston star and published friday 
had hubbert leading siegelman 46 percent to 41 percent with 13 
percent undecided the poll had a margin of error of 46 points 
hubbert 54 has been executive secretary of the alabama 
education association for 21 years he has built the teacher 
organization into one of the most influential forces at the 
statehouse 
siegelman 44 a former executive director of the alabama 
democratic party was state manager of george mcgoverns 1972 
presidential campaign he won two terms as secretary of state and 
then the attorney generals office in 1986 
hubbert has come under fire because the teachers union offered 
representation to a teacher charged with molesting boys in 
tennessee the teacher later was convicted it is union policy to 
offer legal help to members 
both candidates have strong support from black voters and are 
considered racial progressives blacks make up about 25 percent of 
the voters 
siegelman however said hubbert used racist code words in 
calling for a workfare program to replace welfare while hubberts 
camp said a siegelman ad warning about a black leaders influence 
amounted to racist tactics 
the black leader is joe reed head of the states oldest black 
caucus and the no 2 man behind hubbert at the teachers union 
reeds group endorsed hubbert 
during the threeweek runoff siegelman accused hubbert of 
making promises that would require the doubling of alabamas 35 
billion budget and the raising of 10 billion in new taxes over 
four years 
hubbert alluding to siegelmans use of marijuana said the 10 
billion claim makes one wonder what he was smoking to come up 
with such funny numbers 
siegelman supports a lottery and a timber tax to raise revenue 
hubbert said the states problems can be solved with existing 
revenue

twentyfour young scouts with portable 
radios will help lay down the law here this summer by patrolling 
parks and checking on vacation homes 
the police explorers a program for lawminded boy scouts have 
had a post in this berkshires town since 1981 but questions over 
the communitys liability kept the scouts off patrol except for a 
brief period in 1986 
last week town selectmen agreed to reinstate the patrols after 
the posts adviser police officer richard nicholas jr assured 
them the troop is now covered under the local scout councils 
500000 insurance policy 
the 16 boys and eight girls ranging in age from 14 to 21 will 
keep an eye on vacation homes patrol main street parks and 
cemeteries and help out at special events 
the idea is to give these young people many of whom are 
planning careers in law enforcement or plan to attend law school a 
chance to have some handson experience said lee sneath 
spokesman for the boy scouts of america based in irving texas 
the scouts have more than 2000 police explorer posts with 
36000 members nationwide he said each post devises its own 
program some patrol and others are used for crowd and traffic 
control and police paperwork 
sneath said he knew of no other post whose activities were 
affected by liability problems 
the scouts in dalton a town of about 8000 wont replace 
police on their evening foot patrols nicholas said 
they are to serve more as another set of eyes and ears he 
said their main purpose is to curb vandalism and help out with 
such things as parking cars for events as long as they are off the 
road 
the scouts will be issued radios so they can call police 
cruisers nicholas said 
they have a very very strict set of rules set up by me he 
said they are to avoid any confrontations and to use the radio 
and not get involved if they come upon something

china has allowed fang lizhi its bestknown 
dissident to leave his yearlong refuge in the us embassy and go 
to a foreign country the official xinhua news agency said monday 
the agency said fang a 53yearold astrophysicist and his wife 
li shuxian had been given lenient treatment by the government 
and allowed to leave the country for medical treatment 
fang was chinas most outspoken and eloquent proponent of 
democratic reform he and his wife fled into the us embassy 
shortly after the june 4 1989 military attack that crushed the 
sevenweek prodemocracy movement 
xinhua report did not say where the couple had gone or when they 
left china 
the us embassy said it would have no comment until white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater made a formal announcement early monday 
in washington but were very happy one diplomat said 
fang 53 and li had both been named in chinese warrants that 
could have carried death sentences upon conviction 
fangs release removes a major thorn in uschina relations 
which have deteriorated badly since the military crackdown 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the assault on central 
beijing and thousands of activists arrested in the months that 
followed 
fang and li sought us protection after being accused by the 
communist government of inciting the studentled protests in which 
they never played an active role american diplomats refused to 
turn them over to chinese authorities exacerbating tensions 
between beijing and washington 
to protest the crackdown the united states imposed limited 
sanctions focusing on military and aviation equipment 
however uschinese relations recently improved with the bush 
administration decision last month to extend mostfavorednation 
trade status for another month the us congress is now debating 
the issue 
the xinhua report said fang and li a physicist had met two 
conditions mentioned by chinese leaders as conditions for their 
release that they admit in writing their antigovernment 
activities and promise not to engage in antigovernment activities 
after leaving china 
fang and li well known for their advocacy of democracy and human 
rights in china well before last years crackdown 
fang had led chinese intellectuals in calling for release of 
political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific 
progress is impossible without protections for free thought and 
expression 
he also angered chinese authorities by saying marxism is dead 
xinhua said fang and li had recently written to the government 
admitting that they had opposed socialist principles thus 
violating the countrys constitution 
in view of the signs of repentance by fang lizhi and li 
shuxian and their illness and out of humanitarian considerations 
the beijing public security bureau has decided to allow them to go 
abroad for medical treatment in line with chinas polity of 
leniency towards those who participated in the disturbances 
the report did not elaborate on their illness their son 
fang ke a student at wayne state university in detroit said 
earlier this month that his parents were in good spirits and 
continued their work within the us embassy 
while at the embassy fang and li declined to talk with 
reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all questions 
about them

nearly two decades after reform jews began 
accepting women as rabbis they are being asked to extend the same 
welcome to homosexuals 
a resolution in support of homosexual rabbis was scheduled for a 
vote today at the central conference of american rabbis and it was 
expected to pass 
the reform movement has more than 15 million jews in the united 
states led by about 1560 reform rabbis it is the largest of the 
three main branches of judaism in this country 
the movement accepted women as rabbis beginning in 1972 the 
acceptance of homosexuals would be a major break from 4000 years 
of jewish tradition 
a 17member committee has prepared and recommended for approval 
a resolution that says homosexuals are as qualified as 
heterosexuals to lead congregations 
jewish law embodied in the torah and other texts condemns 
homosexuality as an abomination but out of concern for human 
dignity one is permitted to violate the prohibitions of torah 
said rabbi samuel karff of houston conference president and a 
member of the committee 
about 500 rabbis are attending the fourday conference which 
ends wednesday 
the conservative jewish movement has had women rabbis since 
1985 but it does not openly accept homosexual rabbis orthodox 
jews the third major branch oppose ordination of women or 
homosexuals as forbidden by jewish law 
judaisms smaller reconstructionist movement and the unitarian 
universalist church openly accept homosexual clergy and some other 
christian denominations approve ordination of homosexuals if they 
remain celibate 
the committee headed by rabbi selig salkowitz of union temple 
in new york city arrived at its conclusion after a fouryear study 
the committee urges that all rabbis regardless of sexual 
orientation be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred 
vocation which they have chosen reads a draft of the resolution 
sexual orientation is irrelevant to the human worth of a person 
at the same time a majority of the committee affirmed that 
heterosexual marriage remains the ideal 
the central conference of american rabbis said there are 
probably dozens of gay and lesbian rabbis who already have been 
ordained 
several rabbis warned that even if the resolution passed many 
congregations still would not accept homosexual leaders 
to say that im gay before a congregation and expect that to 
be accepted is erroneous thinking were not saying this is a 
norm in our religion because it is not rabbi gary zola national 
dean of the hebrew union collegejewish institute of religion in 
cincinnati said in an interview 
zola said the college which ordains about 40 rabbis a year from 
campuses in new york los angeles cincinnati and jerusalem has 
ordained homosexuals unofficially 
the colleges admissions policy has been to ignore the issue 
unless a candidate brings it up and even then it is considered 
among the candidates other qualifications he said 
but he knew of only one rabbi who has openly admitted to being 
homosexual he was dismissed by his congregation and went on to 
form another zola said 
the central conference of american rabbis can refuse to place 
and congregations can dismiss a rabbi but a homosexual rabbi 
cannot lose his or her ordination which represents an attainment 
of learning not a sanctification by god as in the priesthood 
this resolution is hardly going to guarantee an end to social 
learning and prejudice however its a critical beginning said 
rabbi yoel kahn of shaar zahav a primarily homosexual 
congregation in san francisco

japan has overtaken the united states to become the 
biggest donor of government aid to the third world the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said today 
the parisbased group said japans total aid effort in 1989 was 
9 billion compared with 77 billion for the united states 
the us figure represented a decline of 27 percent from 1988 
after adjusting for inflation 
the thirdbiggest donor in dollars after japan and the us 
was france with 514 billion followed by west germany with 495 
billion 
the report could soften criticism that japan with its immense 
financial strength has not done its share to help developing 
countries 
the decline meant that us aid as a share of gross national 
product declined from 021 percent in 1988 to 015 percent last 
year the worst performance among the industrial democracies that 
are the organizations main aid donor countries 
joseph wheeler chairman of the groups development assistance 
committee told a news conference sunday that us aid to the third 
world has fallen steadily in recent years 
but wheeler said he expects the united states will lift its aid 
effort to at least 9 billion this year he said us contributions 
to multilateral aid institutions should return to normal levels in 
1990 and substantial new aid programs in central america are 
likely 
but this probably wont be enough to enable the united states to 
regain its status as the no 1 aid provider wheeler said since 
japan plans to spend at least 31 billion on aid over the next 
three years 
wheeler said government assistance to developing countries from 
all sources in 1989 totalled 513 billion scarecely changed from 
the yearearlier figure of 517 billion 
the total flow including private funds and export credits to 
these countries is estimated at 109 billion up 45 percent from 
1988 
wheeler said the aid effort of the international groups 18 
richest countries has increased in real terms at an average rate of 
29 percent a year or a total of about 33 percent in the past 
decade 
wheeler said the aid effort of western industrialized nations in 
1989 wasnt affected by assistance to eastern europe most donor 
countries have indicated future aid to eastern europe will not be 
diverted from traditional aid recipients he said 
the group said scandinavian countries continued to provide the 
most official aid last year as a percentage of gnp led by norway 
with 102 percent 
the organizations member nations are australia austria

south korea and the united states 
concluding more than a year of negotiations signed a memorandum 
today to move the us military command in korea out of seoul by 
1996 
the agreement is an important milestone and demonstrates the 
excellent coordinating and consultation process of our two 
countries said gen louis c menetrey commander of us forces 
in south korea 
he and south korean defense minister lee sanghoon signed the 
memorandum 
the agreement calls for south korea to pay the entire cost of 
the move including the purchase of land and construction of base 
facilities while the united states bears only maintenance costs 
the total cost of the move was not yet known but menetrey said 
construction of base facilities alone would cost at least 1 
billion 
the site also has not been settled but some south korean 
newspapers quoting informed government sources said pyongtaek 50 
miles south of seoul is a top candidate 
officials of both countries said the agreement would help blunt 
a tenacious antius campaign by korean radical students it would 
remove a highly visible target for attacks by the radicals who 
claim the us military presence in their country blocks seouls 
unification with communist north korea 
south korean radicals a small but vocal minority have 
frequently attacked us military facilities with firebombs 
demanding the withdrawal of the 43000 us troops stationed in the 
country under a mutual defense treaty

celebrations on quebecs national holiday were 
dampened by rain and by bitterness over the failure of an accord 
aimed at keeping the frenchspeaking province in the canadian 
federation 
there are a lot of people for whom today is a day of 
mourning michel rivard a popular quebec singer said sunday on 
st john the baptist day 
the holiday came a day after the deadline for ratification of 
the socalled meech lake accord which would have provided 
constitutional guarantees recognizing frenchspeaking quebec as a 
distinct society 
the meech lake accord was effectively torpedoed friday by 
newfoundland premier clyde wells who suspended debate on the 
amendment in his legislature and thus denied the required unanimous 
ratification by all 10 provinces 
many in english canada feared the accord would have given quebec 
extra powers but constitutional experts said the distinct 
society clause would have had few practical effects 
the clause however had strong symbolic significance in quebec 
canadas largest province with onefourth of the countrys 26 
million people 
a parade and gala evening concert marking sundays holiday 
quebecs equivalent of the fourth of july were postponed until 
today because of wet weather 
but sunday was still a day for displays of nationalist 
sentiment blue and white quebec flags sprouted in windows and on 
balconies throughout the city some cars flying enormous quebec 
flags drove up and down the streets winning scattered cheers 
nationalist tshirts sold briskly along the rue st denis 
there have been concerns that the failure of meech lake might 
lead to a renewed push by quebecs citizens for independence 
headlines in provincial newspapers focused on quebec premier 
robert bourassas comments that he would boycott future 
constitutional talks as the province decides on a new course for 
the future 
but the prevailing opinion was that there would be no 
precipitous move toward independence or toward some sort of 
sovereigntyassociation relationship with the rest of canada 
we wont be in a hurry said paulandre comeau editor of 
the montreal newspaper le devoir everybody will go on summer 
vacation then well make up our minds 
newfoundland and manitoba were the only holdout provinces 
against meech lake named after the government retreat near ottawa 
where it was originally worked out in 1987 
manitoba leaders tried to bring the accord to a vote but were 
blocked by a lone indian legislator who promised to kill the accord 
because he wanted similar recognition as distinct for native people 
the fivepoint meech lake accord was aimed at winning quebecs 
signature on the 1982 constitution which applies to the province 
even without its signature 
francine pelletier a columnist for the newspaper la presse 
wrote that the real reason for the failure of meech lake was the 
inability of english canada to allow quebec to be different 
prime minister brian mulroney who had made ratification of 
meech lake a personal crusade may have suffered the biggest 
setback even before the ratification deadline expired his 
approval rating only stood at 15 to 17 percent in the polls 
the prime minister himself a bilingual quebecois spent st 
john the baptist day in the quebec town of baie st paul 
i have no doubt that justice eventually will be done to 
quebec he said in a brief speech 
mulroney ignored opposition calls that he resign and said he 
would search for a new way to bring the frenchspeaking province 
into the constitutional family 
bob keaton president of alliance quebec representing the 
provinces englishspeaking minority warned that the nationalists 
would be quick to try to fill the political vacuum left by meech 
lakes failure 
unless federal leaders come forward with an alternative 
immediately to fill in that vacuum i think were in very deep 
trouble keaton said

in a gun attack last week on the governing council of state 
serge villard a council member and an author of haitis 1987 
constitution died sunday while being flown by air ambulance to 
miami for emergency treatment said commerce minister maurice 
lafortune

villard authored article 291 of the constitution which banned 
known supporters of the duvaliers from running for public office

stations 
mrs pascaltrouillot said in a speech late saturday on

fresh aftershocks hit earthquakedevastated 
northern iran early today sending dazed survivors fleeing in panic 
for open ground and setting off landslides that snarled rescue 
efforts 
thursdays earthquake killed at least 50000 people and more 
than half a million are homeless authorities say 
eighttwo aftershocks some as strong as 55 on the richter 
scale rattled the quake zone today and sunday tehran universitys 
geophysics center said 
one landslide blocked a 35mile stretch of road between rasht 
and rudbar a critical supply route in the quake zone about 125 
miles northwest of tehran relief convoys were caught in traffic 
jams on other bouldercovered roads 
the official islamic republic news agency irna reported 
nonstop rescue efforts with army helicopters flying relief 
missions around the clock 
the tragedy is so grave it cannot be described ive never 
seen such a catastrophe before it quoted the helicopter forces 
commander as saying 
the commander said one pilot who lost his mother sister and 
brother in the quake returned to duty to fly relief missions as 
soon as he had buried them 
in rudbar an agricultural city of 100000 people thousands of 
tents have been set up by the red crescent the islamic equivalent 
of the red cross to house people about 95 percent of the citys 
buildings were destroyed or damaged in the quake 
the stench of decomposing bodies hung over the city as rescuers 
aided by police dogs pulled bodies from the rubble officials were 
worried about contamination of water supplies and the spread of 
infectious diseases as they struggled to bury the overwhelming 
numbers of dead 
dont ask me how many are dead ask how many survived irna 
quoted a man from kopteh as saying only me my son and a woman 
from my village 
my survival was a miracle because tons and tons of rocks slid 
from mountain peaks and buried the village and all the villagers 
livestock and orchards are under mountains of rock and rubble he 
said 
four days after the quake there were still conflicting death 
tolls the tehran times considered close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani quoted an unidentified senior relief official as saying 
50000 people died and 200000 were injured in the quake 
he said even that was a conservative estimate because the 
figures are quoted taking account only of those who have been 
registered officially as dead or wounded many victims were not 
counted he said 
in geneva senior un relief official mhamed essaafi also 
estimated the toll would reach 50000 dead and 200000 injured 
tehran radio put the toll late sunday at 48000 killed and 100000 
injured 
accounting for the dead injured and homeless was difficult 
because whole towns and villages remained isolated army 
mountaineers climbed peaks in the rugged region in an effort to 
rescue villagers trapped in remote hamlets the news agency said 
in manjil a farming and fishing community of 2000 people about 
125 miles northwest of tehran only a few telephone poles and parts 
of some buildings were left standing in a nearby field army 
bulldozers dug communal graves which soldiers filled with hundreds 
of bodies 
a large mural portrait of late revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini half his face reduced to rubble loomed above 
the remains of a house 
for the first time since khomeinis 1979 islamic revolution 
iran is accepting overt us aid a cargo jet carrying 42 tons of 
us aid including bandages antiseptic burn cream tents and 
orange slices in syrup arrived in tehran on sunday 
to be on the ground here in tehran is a very special feeling 
for us said stephen m johnson president of americares a 
private us relief organization based in new canaan conn 
in addition to the aid collected by americares a red cross 
charter flight left washington carrying supplies donated by the 
us government 
iran and the united states have had no diplomatic ties since the 
takeover of the us embassy in tehran by islamic militants who 
held 52 americans hostage for 444 days in 1979 and 1980 
the us supplies were among tons of relief equipment arriving 
in the iranian capital over the weekend tehran radio said sunday 
that 68 relief aircraft had landed at the capitals mehrabad 
airport during a 24hour period 
the radical newspaper jomhuri islami had urged that no help be 
accepted from the united states and other countries whose hands 
are stained with the blood of the iranian people 
our people even under the rubble chant death to america 
and pray to god to cut off the hands of the united states even 
those hands stretched out to help it said in an editorial 
the foreign ministry however said that due to the magnitude 
of the disaster iran would accept all such aid except from 
israel and south africa 
the quakes toll was the highest anywhere since july 28 1976 
when an estimated 200000 people were killed in china by a quake 
a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage while one 
of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage thursdays quake registered 
between 73 and 77 on the scale

the new rightwing government launched a 
diplomatic offensive today to reassure international critics that 
it will not settle soviet immigrants in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
on sunday housing minister ariel sharon who is chiefly 
responsible for absorbing the soviet immigration wave gave the 
first specific pledge that israel would not settle soviet 
immigrants beyond israels 1967 borders 
he stressed however that the government would continue efforts 
to increase israeli settlement and thus influence in the 
territories 
today yitzhak shamirs spokesman announced that the prime 
minister sent soviet president mikhail s gorbachev a telegram last 
month saying israel is not settling soviet jews in the occupied 
territories 
the spokesman avi pazner said shamir also sent a letter to 
european community leaders last week saying his twoweekold 
government wants to pursue the middle east peace process 
israel has become increasingly isolated over its refusal to 
accept us proposals for peace talks or to give solid guarantees 
on the settlement of immigrants 
when it took office the new government said that although it 
had no policy of directing soviet jews to the territories it would 
refuse to discourage such settlement 
sharon a hawkish former general and champion of jewish 
settlement in the occupied lands had been as steadfast as any 
member of the new government in defending the right of israelis to 
settle where they choose 
the united states has joined the soviet union arab and european 
states in opposing the settlement of soviet jews in the west bank 
and gaza and both superpowers have threatened to penalize israel 
unless such settlement stops 
our efforts in resettling immigrants are directed at this side 
of the green line sharon said sunday referring to israels 
pre1967 borders 
as far as the immigrants are concerned they will not be 
settled because of the problems we have beyond the green line 
he did not say what if anything the israeli government would 
do to try to prevent new arrivals from the soviet union from moving 
to the occupied lands 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said today that sharons statement did not apply to east jerusalem 
the predominantly arab sector seized from jordan in 1967 and 
annexed to israel 
east jerusalem is in israel the official told reporters 
distinguishing it from the occupied territories 
the foreign ministry official said shamir told the leaders of 
the 12 european community states that his government would absorb 
soviet jewish immigrants in ways that will not prejudice the 
position of any other inhabitants 
they will not take the place of others and will not uproot 
them this is our conviction our policy and our commitment the 
official quoted the shamirs letter as saying 
pazner insisted neither sharons remarks nor shamirs telegram 
to gorbachev signaled a policy change 
he said shamir sent the telegram to the soviet leader soon after 
gorbachev threatened to reverse the soviet policy of allowing jews 
to freely emigrate 
the united states also considers all new israeli settlement in 
the occupied territories an obstacle to peace it has sought 
guarantees that the soviet immigrants are not settled in the 
occupied territories before approving a 400 million housing loan 
israel has asked for to use for immigrant resettlement 
palestinians in the occupied territories have joined arab 
nations in protesting the wave of soviet jewish immigration 
fearing that immigrants settling on occupied lands could push 
palestinians out 
at least 56000 soviet jews have arrived in israel since the 
beginning of 1989 and the figure is expected to reach 150000 this 
year 
about 320 have settled in the occupied lands home to 17 
million palestinians and some 70000 jewish settlers an additional 
3400 to 4500 have moved into jewish suburbs of annexed east 
jerusalem which was seized along with the west bank and gaza in 
the 1967 middle east war 
sharon made the announcement in a speech to the board of 
governors of the jewish agency which helps resettle immigrants 
but he also pledged that israel would not stop its settlement 
drive in the occupied territories 
it does not mean that other people cannot settle in any place 
construction will be continued in accordance with government 
policy in all parts of the land of israel sharon said in the 
speech which was broadcast on israel radio 
he said israel wanted the immigrants to settle in the central 
part of the country the southern negev desert and the northern 
galilee area 
sharon who as defense minister led israels 1982 invasion of 
lebanon was appointed housing minister and head of the ministerial 
committee on immigrant absorption earlier this month just after 
shamir formed his new rightwing coalition 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek speaking to the jewish agency 
forum praised sharons statement 
to put ideology above immigration is a capital mistake 
kollek said

the letterwriting gunman threatening to shoot 
12 people one for each sign of the zodiac is now a killer 
a 78yearold man who was shot in the back and beaten may 31 
died sunday at jamaica hospital he was one of four men who have 
been shot by the socalled zodiac gunman since march 
the citys chief of detectives joseph borrelli said it was 
only luck that the three other victims were still alive 
i think he is intending to shoot them and kill them 
borrelli said 
the zodiac shot his latest victim thursday a homeless man 
sleeping on a central park bench all four victims were vulnerable 
including a 50yearold man who used a cane to steady a limp and a 
33yearold man who was tipsy 
at least one of the victims the latest one was stalked 
because of his astrological sign police said 
larry parnham the wounded homeless man told detectives he was 
befriended days before the shooting by a stranger who asked him his 
birth date borrelli said 
the day after the shooting a note taking responsibility and 
introducing the writer as the zodiac was received by the new 
york post 
the birth dates of all four victims correspond to astrological 
signs scrawled in notes written by the killer borrelli said 
we were concerned and we were confused as to the manner in 
which these shootings were happening under the sign of the 
individual victim he said when you get four out of four i 
think it goes beyond luck 
police believe the gunman has copied the methods of californias 
zodiac killer a man who claimed responsibility for as many as 40 
killings in a series of notes sent to san franciscoarea newspapers 
from 1968 to 1987 
in the most recent letter to the post the gunman claimed to be 
the same man who terrorized california but police said they dont 
believe that 
astrologers had warned police that the first day of summer when 
the central park shooting occurred was considered a significant 
day because the zodiac changed from the sign of gemini to the sign 
of cancer 
after the central park shooting borrelli said this opens up 
a whole new pandoras box weve got the whole city now to be 
looking at 
police have a zodiac task force of about 50 officers on the 
case borrelli said

solidarity leaders have issued a death 
certificate for the movement that one year ago toppled communist 
rule a leading political commentator said today 
sixtythree leading members of solidarity broke ranks with 
movement leader lech walesa sunday over his criticism of the 
solidarityled government of premier tadeusz mazowiecki a former 
walesa adviser 
they said walesa should disband solidaritys citizens committee 
which since 1988 has functioned as the movements political arm 
leading the successful campaign that ended four decades of 
communist rule 
the suggestion came in a letter read during a heated daylong 
meeting of the 200member citizens committee at which walesa and 
his opponents traded barbs 
the tone of walesas supporters many recently appointed to the 
committee was threatening brutal polands largest newspaper 
gazeta wyborcza said today 
in the end the committee postponed considering the letter for 
one month walesa had asked that emotions be allowed to cool 
lets think it over maybe there are solutions for our further 
joint path the solidarity chairman said 
the signatories of the letter agreed to remain on the committee 
in the meantime 
what has ended is not only the time of heroic solidarity 
konstantin gebert one of the bestknown solidarity journalists 
wrote in todays zycie warszawy daily what has ended simply 
put is the idea of solidarity as a united community fighting 
against evil 
in the auditorium they only issued the death certificate 
the signatories include major figures of the solidarity 
movement zbigniew bujak and wladyslaw frasyniuk former leaders of 
the solidarity underground jacek kuron a veteran dissident who is 
now the minister of labor adam michnik a member of parliament and 
leading newspaper editor and bronislaw geremek one of walesas 
first advisers 
the men were once walesas closest allies in his struggle to 
make the communists share power with opposition forces 
but now they differ with walesa over his criticisms of the 
mazowiecki government for what walesa considers the slow pace of 
political and economic change poland is dismantling a centrally 
planned economy and building a free market system in its place 
the former allies also disagree with walesas drive to become 
president of poland and his opening the citizens committee to 
politicians from groups that were outside the old solidarity 
movement 
mazowiecki stayed away from the meeting but in a speech in 
szczecin he appealed for unity until the country completes painful 
economic reforms 
the emotional debate among citizens committee members was tinged 
with sadness and anger 
i have a feeling that i have lost something said geremek 
leader of the solidarity caucus in parliament taking the floor 
near the end of the day 
in our movement there used to be no leader there were no 
servants there were citizens there were friends what 
happened he asked addressing walesa 
michnik told walesa he had no right to say who could use the 
name of solidarity michnik edits gazeta wyborcza whose use of the 
solidarity logo walesa is disputing 
nobody can take away our struggle not even you lech he 
said 
the veteran solidarity activists want the citizens committee 
recently packed with new members beholden to walesa to be 
dissolved so that they can create a movement that would support 
mazowiecki and remain true to what they consider to be solidaritys 
historic ideals 
walesa said his recent criticisms of the government including a 
vow to create a war at the top have been intended to help 
mazowiecki by conveying the frustrations of workers and farmers 
eager for a better standard of living 
walesa has criticized the government for moving too slowly to 
oust former communists from positions of authority and he says he 
fears his former allies in solidarity might create a new political 
monopoly 
walesa aides recently formed a political group the center 
alliance to promote his election to the presidency of poland 
still held by former communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
walesa critics charge that he is becoming a danger to democracy 
because he stirs emotions against the government at a time when it 
faces populist attacks for carrying out painful economic reforms 
they say that as president of poland he would rule by decree 
undermining polands parliament and government

chinas release of dissident fang lizhi today 
appeared likely to clear the way for japan to resume a huge loan 
program and reclaim its role as the biggest source of credit to 
beijing 
the vice foreign minister takakazu kuriyama welcomed the news 
that fang and his wife li shuxian had been permitted to leave 
their refuge in the us embassy in beijing and fly to britain 
chinas move created a favorable environment for reopening 
talks on the loan program but there would not be any such talks 
before the houston summit of the seven industrialized democracies 
in early july kuriyama was quoted as telling japanese reporters 
fangs release was expected to put relations with china high on 
the agenda of western leaders at the houston summit sanctions 
against beijing were solidified at last years economic summit in 
france 
kyodo news service said prime minister toshiki kaifu described 
chinas move as signaling good directions in an overall trend 
but it said he told japanese reporters asking about unfreezing 
the loans we wont necessarily do so just because of this 
action 
japan had pledged 52 billion in a fiveyear program of loans 
to china but the plan was frozen after the suppression of 
prodemocracy protesters in june 1989 tokyo also joined other big 
western countries in banning highlevel contacts with chinese 
officials and repeatedly called on beijing to release political 
prisoners and take other steps to show respect for human rights 
japan however has argued that for the sake of stability in the 
far east china should not be isolated in the international 
community 
last week foreign minister taro nakayama told parliament that 
japan eventually would move ahead with its loan program in order 
not to have china isolated 
foreign ministry officials quoted kuriyama the vice minister 
as saying the release of fang and li showed that china was trying 
to improve relations with the west and he hoped western countries 
would take a positive view of such a conciliatory move 
kyodo news service quoted an unidentified high finance ministry 
official as saying fangs release is expected to cause a change 
in attitude toward china at the houston summit 
japan had contributed 61 billion in loans and grants to china 
before beijings crackdown on the prodemocracy movement last year 
the frozen loan program was to have financed projects to develop 
chinas backward infrastructure the loans were crucial to chinas 
19911995 economic plan but when they were supposed to have 
started in april negotiations had not even begun

a longtime cave enthusiast who was 
trapped in a cave for five days with his two sons says hes had 
enough of exploring 
right now i think im going to pack up the stuff gear and 
keep it as memories of my past gary lutes said im not sure 
ill go back underground again that was enough to show that just 
one momentary error could have cost the life of three of us 
once you go underground the cave is unforgiving you dont 
get second chances like this we were just very fortunate he 
told the associated press in a telephone interview from his 
hospital bed sunday 
lutes 37 a tampa fla land surveyor and sons gary jr 13 
and timothy 9 were rescued from a pendleton county wva cave 
on saturday they had been lost since the previous monday state 
police said 
the three were taken to rockingham memorial hospital in 
harrisonburg where they were in stable condition sunday 
the three endured dehydration hallucinations and bats during 
the vigil which began when their lamps went out while they 
explored a side trail lutes said 
lutes a member of the national speleological society a 
cavestudy group said he never had been lost in 20 years of cave 
adventuring 
but on monday he put down his pack to squeeze through a small 
opening a halfmile into new trout cave in eastern west virginia 
about 200 miles west of washington dc he intended to retrieve 
the pack on his way out 
but when their lamps went out the three couldnt find the 
opening or the pack which held food water and extra lights lutes 
said 
i knew if there was panic or terror wed be nowhere he 
said we wouldnt have made it unless we were sitting and being 
calm 
they took turns keeping watch they recited bible scriptures and 
prayed they would be rescued lutes said 
toward the end we figured we were going to die lutes said 
we were happy it would be all three of us together and not just 
one we figured that was better than continuing on like that 
the search didnt start until thursday when relatives in 
powhatan va contacted police after the luteses missed a meeting 
police said 
about 25 experienced cave rescuers from virginia west virginia 
and maryland joined more than 50 police fire and emergency squads 
in the search 
using lutes parked car as a starting point they began combing 
three sets of caves about 1030 pm friday 
they found the pack about 1230 am saturday and reached the 
luteses 90 minutes later said state police trooper rd gillespie 
the three were caked in dirt and parched but in remarkably good 
condition when they emerged 
the first thing they said was thank god you came said 
rescuer john hempel the second thing they said was do you have 
any water 
barry chute a national speleological society member from 
maryland who led the rescue effort said that lutes did the right 
thing by staying put 
if you get lost and lose your light sources you cant go 
anywhere in a cave he said you cant grope your way out 
youd just go in circles 
lutes said both he and the boys came to appreciate life a little 
more when they faced death 
i thought to myself if i ever get out of this what do those 
things mean job pressure whether i get the lawn mowed things 
like that 
i prayed so hard id be given a second chance and it came 
through

leaders of the european community today 
agreed to meet in december to work out details on achieving 
political union by 1993 the agreement came despite reservations by 
britain and portugal 
also today britain told its european partners that is premature 
to heed west german and french calls for immediate largescale aid 
to the soviet union 
frances foreign minister roland dumas announced the agreement 
on a special dec 14 conference soon after the 12 western european 
leaders opened a twoday summit 
dumas told reporters that britain and portugal raised concerns 
that the still undefined form of political union should not rob 
states of national sovereignty 
the agreement had been widely expected after britain said it 
would not try to block the conference on political union which it 
envisages as amounting only to closer cooperation among the members 
of the wealthy trading bloc 
on soviet aid a british government spokesman said some type of 
support was in order the question he said was not whether we 
assist the soviet union it is how 
we have to ask ourselves whether it makes sense to throw large 
amounts of money at the soviet union said the spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity it is not exactly a deprived 
society 
west germany argued for the aid government spokesman hans klein 
told reporters it is in the interests of the entire free world 
to support the reform movements set in motion by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
klein acknowledged that the european leaders probably would not 
reach any conclusions at the dublin meeting but would instead lay 
the groundwork for more talks about the issue at the sevennation 
summit of leading industrialized nations next month in houston 
britain backed by portugal and italy was also pressing for the 
community to ease sanctions against south africa in a firm signal 
of support for president fw de klerks reform moves 
but british officials acknowledged the timing was probably bad 
black leader nelson mandela is on a 14country tour and has been 
urging no letup in sanctions against south africa until apartheid 
is irrevocably dismantled 
the call for the aid package to support gorbachevs reform 
efforts came from west german chancellor helmut kohl and french 
president francois mitterrand 
the matter is really urgent mitterrand said after meeting 
friday with kohl in the rhine river town of ruedesheim 
by providing largescale aid the western nations hope gorbachev 
would be encouraged to end his opposition to immediate membership 
for a united germany in the north atlantic treaty organization 
the west german magazine der spiegel reported saturday that kohl 
plans to travel to moscow in late july with a package of western 
loans worth 15 billion to 19 billion the bonn government denied 
the report 
the european community is coordinating the work of 24 western 
countries to funnel economic aid into poland and hungary the 
program will be extended early next month to other emerging 
democracies in eastern europe 
romania will be excluded because of the violent repression of 
antigovernment protests 
it was considered unlikely the aid program would be widenend to 
include the populous soviet union with its daunting economic 
problems 
in a sign of the changing times east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere was invited to attend todays formal luncheon 
hosted by irish president patrick j hillery east germany will 
become part of the community as it joins with its western neighbor 
the questions of how far to push an economic and monetary union 
and a political merger have sparked controversy 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has strongly opposed 
plans to set up a common currency and europeanwide system of 
central banks 
if you lose sovereignty over monetary and budgetary policy 
you havent got much sovereignty left mrs thatcher said over 
the weekend she also has urged a cautious approach in creating a 
political union of the dozen nations 
the european community nations are belgium britain denmark 
france west germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands portugal and spain

the president of east germanys parliament 
visiting israel along with her west german counterpart said today 
she would seek speedy establishment of relations with the jewish 
state 
israeli officials hailed the visit of sabine bergmannpohl of 
east germany and rita suessmuth of west germany as a special 
goodwill gesture 
the visit is the first joint trip abroad by the leaders of the 
two parliaments and seemed designed to allay israeli concerns about 
german unification 
israelis and not only israelis are worried about the possible 
reemergence of german military might said legislator zalman 
shoval head of the israeligerman friendship association in 
israels knesset or parliament 
on the other hand it would be a mistake to put a unified 
germany in the dock from the outset shoval said in a telephone 
interview before greeting the two visitors at bengurion 
international airport near tel aviv 
knesset speaker dov shilansky a nazi death camp survivor who 
has vowed never to receive german delegations officially took a 
vacation today to avoid attending ceremonies for the visitors 
but a foreign ministry schedule listed a private meeting between 
the parliament presidents and shilansky at his jerusalem home on 
tuesday 
shilansky could not be reached for comment but the daily maariv 
said he would tell the visitors about his suffering at the hands of 
the germans during world war ii 
ms bergmannpohl 43 told reporters she would seek friendly 
relations beteween her country and israel 
i hope i will be able to assist in speeding up the creation of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries said ms 
bergmannpohl a physician and newcomer to politics who became head 
of east germanys first freely elected parliament on april 5 
east germanys hardline communist regime toppled by a popular 
revolt last fall was hostile toward israel it refused to accept 
moral responsibility for the holocaust or pay any reparations to 
the jews 
in april the east german parliament issued a resolution 
apologizing to jews around the world for the atrocities of the 
holocaust and pledging to pay reparations 
preliminary talks on diplomatic relations have been held between 
east germany and israel this year and israeli foreign ministry 
spokesman motti amihai said today efforts will continue even though 
both germanys may be united by the end of the year 
amihai said the visit the first joint trip abroad by the two 
parliament presidents was a continuation of confidencebuilding 
measures begun with the east german parliament resolution 
the central message is the continuation of the historic 
committment toward israel and the jewish people from a united 
germany amihai said 
both ms suessmuth and ms bergmannpohl are christian democrats 
on tuesday they were to tour the yad vashem holocaust memorial 
and attend a discussion on the future of the germans in europe 
they will meet with prime minister yitzhak shamir foreign 
minister david levy president chaim herzog and shimon peres 
leader of the opposition labor party before returning home on 
wednesday

a group of american relief workers 
returned to the united states this morning from iran saying they 
were received warmly after dropping off the first largescale us 
aid since the hostage crisis a decade ago 
one guy gave me a big bear hug and said thank you for 
coming said dr david reed a volunteer physician with the 
relief organization americares i said i bet its been a long 
time since you hugged an american and he just smiled 
the earthquake that devastated parts of northern iran on 
thursday killed an estimated 50000 people 
the boeing 707 jetliner carrying eight volunteers from 
americares landed at about 630 am after a 14hour flight from 
tehran 
on sunday the volunteers delivered an estimated 1 million 
worth of supplies for earthquake victims including blankets 
shovels bandages and antiseptic burn cream tents with builtin 
fiberglass frames and orange slices in syrup 
the eight volunteers had hoped to remain in iran to help with 
the relief effort there were conflicting reports about why they 
didnt stay longer than the four hours it took to unload the 40 
tons of supplies in tehran 
reed said the group was told that the bush administration 
wouldnt let volunteers travel beyond the airport because of 
concerns about security but stephen norman vice president of the 
relief group said earlier the group had been unable to get visas 
from iranian authorities 
reed said the iranians seemed disappointed that the americans 
had to leave and gave them a hot meal of lamb rice and broiled 
tomatoes before they took off 
i saw a bunch of dumbfounded but grateful people said 
stephen johnson president of americares virtually everyone we 
talked to said to tell the american people were grateful 
aftershocks continued to rock northern iran on sunday and 
landslides blocked roads hampering recovery efforts after 
thursdays earthquake which some officials estimate killed 50000 
people 
the cargo pallets heaped with supplies mostly from american 
pharmaceutical companies and private individuals each bore an 
american flag and a handlettered sign in farsi reading from the 
american people to the iranian people with very great affection and 
love we offer you these things 
it was the first overt us shipment of its kind to be accepted 
by iran since the hostage crisis of 197981 when 52 american 
hostages were held at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days the 
two nations have no diplomatic ties 
johnson said americares which is based in new canaan conn 
hopes to have another shipment of supplies ready soon 
americares officials said they received scores of telephone 
calls both opposing and supporting the relief effort even before 
the shipment left connecticut on saturday 
reed said he told one critic of relief to iran that these are 
people not a political institution theyve been devastated by an 
earthquake 
the us relief shipment also had some critics in iran a 
radical newspaper considered a mouthpiece of hardline opponents of 
president hashemi rafsansjani urged sunday that no help be accepted 
from the united states and other countries whose hands are 
stained with the blood of the iranian people 
but the foreign ministry said sunday that iran would accept all 
aid due to the magnitude of the disaster

japan and the united states began a final round of 
talks today on extensive structural reforms aimed at improving 
trade investment and the quality of life in both nations 
officials are trying to finish a final report on the talks 
dubbed the structural impediments initiative before the houston 
summit of seven major industrialized nations begins july 9 
the talks began in july 1989 as an effort to help cut japans 
massive trade imbalance with the united states by reforming 
business practices and policies that are believed to act as 
structural trade and investment barriers last year japan had a 
49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
washington has committed itself to cutting the federal budget 
deficit encouraging savings curbing excessive consumption and 
improving worker training and education 
japan has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores speed 
processing of patent applications crack down on unfair business 
practices and increase public works spending 
talks began today with a discussion of japans landuse 
policies the foreign ministry said in a statement 
us officials say reforms are needed to deflate excessively 
high real estate prices that prevent foreign firms from setting up 
business here 
the issue of japans public works spending was expected to be a 
subject of debate during this weeks talks 
both nations agree that japan should spend more on parks roads 
and sewers to stimulate more imports and to reduce the imbalance 
between savings and investment in this thrifty nation 
but they disagree over exactly how much more should be spent 
us officials appear to have given up a demand they voiced last 
week that japan pledge a specific percentage of its annual gross 
national product to public works the gross national product is the 
total value of a nations goods and services 
japanese officials rejected committing such a percentage to such 
projects because it would limit the governments flexibility 
economists say japans booming economy has a limited capacity to 
absorb an increase in public spending without stimulating inflation 
a senior us official rejected that argument sunday it 
suggests that the japanese people should be eternally resigned to 
having inadequate infrastructure said charles dallara assistant 
treasury secretary 
less than half of japanese homes are connected to sewers and 
development of other public facilities in this overcrowded nation 
lags behind other industrialized countries

moslem clerics claiming to represent 
the afghan guerrilla movement condemned education for women and 
warned of a greater catastrophe than communism unless schools 
for women were closed 
but a spokesman for a selfdeclared guerrilla 
governmentinexile said today the view was not the policy of 
his coalition of usbacked guerrillas fighting the afghan 
government 
in a postersized edict 80 mullahs or islamic clerics said 
women attending schools where subjects like english history and 
geography are being taught instead of islamic texts and roles are 
disgraceful 
the lengthy edict written in afghanistans native pushto 
language also said women must not go out without their husbands 
permission laugh when speaking wear perfume speak to strangers 
look at a man with a sexual sense or wear clothing that rustles 
under the edict woman must only wear a traditional headtotoe 
blanketlike covering 
in the past several months fundamentalist rebels have threatened 
revolutionary action against afghan women working with foreign 
aid groups or teaching at afghanrun schools many women say they 
fear retribution if they talk to western journalists 
najibullah lefray spokesman for the rebel government based in 
pakistans frontier city of peshawar said today that the edict was 
written by a section of the ulema or council of clerics 
it is not the policy of the guerrilla government in 
islam seeking knowledge is a religious obligation for men and women 
and it does not differentiate between religious and other 
learning said lefray 
the first thing will be to invite the ulema who have signed 
this and make them understand that this is not the view of all the 
ulema and then we should try to convince them to change their 
minds he said 
when about 115000 soviet soldiers left afghanistan in february 
1989 after nine years of military intervention the rebel 
governmentinexile was touted by its western backers as a likely 
replacement to the communiststyle government moscow left behind in 
kabul 
but the government has degenerated into a chaotic collection of 
bickering rebel warlords say many afghan and western analysts 
more than 3 million afghan war refugees fled to pakistan after 
the 1979 military intervention of soviet troops in afghanistan 
another 2 million live in iran 
rebel fighters have refused to lay down their weapons until 
kabuls sovietstyle government has been toppled

the college student son of chinese dissidents 
says hes happy his parents were allowed to leave china today but 
he expressed concern for those still jailed in his homeland for 
prodemocracy actions 
fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian left china for britain 
today they had sought refuge in the us embassy in bejing after 
the june 4 1989 military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
i feel happy for my family and for their release but we 
dont know the exact number of people still in jail said their 
son fang ke a student at wayne state university in detroit 
fang ke said he doubted the chinese governments explanation 
that his parents were allowed to leave because they had repudiated 
their role in the democracy movement and needed medical care 
neither was particularly ill said fang ke who said he kept in 
touch with his parents by letter during their year at the embassy 
they have another son in china 
fang ke said he hoped to visit them soon in britain

the supreme court today agreed to decide who 
the secretary of labor or a safety and health review board has 
the last word on what federal regulations require for onthejob 
safety 
the courts decision expected sometime next year will 
determine whether cfampi steel corp of pueblo colo must pay a 
10000 fine for not making sure the respirators given to coke oven 
workers fit them properly 
cfampi was fined in 1979 by the secretary of labor but the 
occupational safety and health review commission set aside the fine 
in 1986 
the secretary of labor had interpreted a regulation governing 
employee exposure to coke oven emissions as a testing standard 
that imposes an obligation by employers to make sure respirators 
fit 
but the commission interpreted the regulation as a training 
standard not requiring such employer assurances of proper fits 
cfampi produces coke a coal derivative to fuel the blast 
furnaces of its steel plant in pueblo 
the labor department in 1976 determined that coke oven emissions 
are cancercausing and issued safety standards limiting exposure 
to them the standard permits the use of respirators as one method 
of compliance 
cfampi was cited in 1977 for several coke emission violations and 
again in 1979 one of the labor department citations issued in 1979 
imposed the 10000 fine for willful violation of the 
respirator regulation 
an administrative law judge for the review commission upheld the 
citation but the commission reversed that judgment 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals last december ruled 
against the secretary of labor 
in the face of conflicting regulatory interpretations 
deference is properly accorded to the interpretation of the 
commission the appeals court said 
other appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion 
the commission created under the occupational safety and health 
act of 1970 hears disputes over safety citations and penalties 
it does not have the power to review safety and health standards 
issued by the federal government that reviewing authority is held 
by federal appeals courts 
the case is dole vs occupational safety and health review

the supreme court today refused to exempt the 
mining industry from some federal environmental rules for treating 
storing and disposing of hazardous waste 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the american 
mining congress and a mining company solite corp the two 
challenged a 1987 decision by the environmental protection agency 
to apply the hazardous waste regulations to the mining industry 
the industry said it should be exempt under a 1980 law called 
the bevill amendment which temporarily excluded some solid wastes 
from epa rules until the agency could complete a study 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year the epa 
did not exceed its power in enforcing the regulations for the 
mining industry 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
industry appeal 
justice department lawyers noted that waste generated from 
mining including ash and sludge was believed to pose less of a 
hazard to the environment than other forms of toxic waste 
but the government said chemicals and compounds are released 
from the mining wastes that are known to have adverse effects on 
humans or other life forms 
the government said it therefore was appropriate for the epa to 
apply stringent rules to the mining wastes 
the case is american mining congress vs environmental 
protection agency 891511

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
14yearold lawsuit by a texas oil refinerys black employees who 
say they are victims of racial discrimination 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that dismissed 
the suit against a union and gulf oil corp 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals in december threw out the 
1976 suit by employees at a gulf oil refinery in port arthur 
the appeals court said a federal judge who ruled against the 
workers was not clearly erroneous in deciding that revised 
seniority and promotion rules at the refinery did not discriminate 
intentionally against blacks 
the appeals court also upheld the judges findings that the 
seniority rules and promotion tests had legitimate business 
purposes even if unintentionally they disproportionately favored 
white workers 
the plant maintained a strictly segregated work force until the 
mid1950s with blacks in unskilled jobs and whites in skilled 
craft positions 
as that began to change the company in 1967 changed 
jobclassification rules in an agreement with the oil chemical and 
atomic workers international union 
gulf oil said the new rules were designed to streamline 
operations and promote efficiency blacks said the rules locked 
them into lowerranking jobs by promoting craft helpers most of 
them white into trainee positions ahead of blacks with more 
seniority 
the black workers also challenged the use of written tests 
revised in 1971 that had the effect of promoting whites 
disproportionately for example nearly every white worker who took 
the tests between 1971 and 1980 passed while only twothirds of 
the blacks passed 
the black employees said the tests were unrelated to job 
performance but gulf said statistics showed that those who did 
well on the tests also did well in their new jobs 
the 5th circuit court in dismissing the suit relied in part on 
a key supreme court ruling last year that makes it harder for 
workers to prove bias 
the appeals court said the high court ruling means that 
employers accused of bias can prevail merely by producing evidence 
not proof that the challenged practice serves in a significant 
way the legitimate employment goals of the employer 
the black workers also questioned whether the appeals court gave 
too broad an interpretation to another 1989 high court decision 
that limits the time frame for some bias suits 
in that ruling the justices said the deadline for filing a suit 
is determined by the date an allegedly biased seniority plan is 
adopted not when an individual worker is affected by the plan 
congress is seeking to overturn or modify both 1989 high court 
rulings as part of a legislative civil rights package the 
legislation is the subject of negotiations in the house and senate 
and with the bush administration 
the case is bernard vs gulf oil 891617

the federal communications commission exceeded its authority in 
ordering the refunds

a virginia death row inmate who killed a 
deputy sheriff in an escape attempt lost a supreme court appeal 
today 
the court left intact a ruling that wilbert lee evans rights 
were not violated when he was resentenced to death after his 
original death sentence was overturned 
evans was convicted of fatally shooting william truesdale on 
jan 27 1981 while the deputy was escorting him from a north 
carolina prison to testify in alexandria va 
evans said he didnt intend to kill truesdale but that the gun 
went off accidentally in their struggle 
prosecutors said evans deliberately killed the deputy in a 
planned escape 
evans was sentenced to death in 1981 but nearly two years later 
prosecutors admitted that although unknown to them at the time 
the sentence was based on erroneous evidence of his prior 
convictions 
a judge threw out the death sentence but evans again received 
the sentence in march 1984 after a jury recommended capital 
punishment because of evans future dangerousness 
virginia enacted a law in march 1983 to permit a second death 
sentence when a death penalty is overturned because of sentencing 
errors 
evans contended that the law unconstitutionally was applied 
retroactively to him without the law his sentence automatically 
would have been reduced to life in prison 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals said applying the new 
law to evans was fair because at the time he killed truesdale he 
knew he could be sentenced to die 
fair warning of punishment was thus afforded to evans the 
appeals court said he was on notice when he murdered deputy 
sheriff truesdale that the imposition of death was a possible 
penalty 
evans also said the jury that sentenced him to death the second 
time was misled by the trial judge 
the jury asked the judge what would happen if it split over the 
punishment for evans rather than tell the jurors a split decision 
automatically would mean a life prison sentence the judge said 
their verdict must be unanimous as to either life imprisonment or 
death 
the 4th circuit court said the judge had no obligation to 
inform the jury of the ultimate result should they fail to reach a 
verdict 
the appeals court also rejected evans argument that prosecutors 
violated his rights by failing to disclose for two years after his 
first sentencing that the sentence was based on erroneous evidence 
the appeals court said prosecutors acted in good faith and were not 
aware until then of the errors 
evans also disputed the jurys finding that he is a danger to 
society 
he said that shortly after he was resentenced he helped head off 
violence when other prisoners at mecklenburg nc correctional 
center seized 14 guards as hostages evans said the hostages 
credited him with saving their lives 
the case is evans vs thompson 89516

a wildfire caused by dry lightning 
has scorched thousands of acres of grassland on this island in the 
great salt lake as 100plus temperatures in the region made 
firefighting difficult 
mitch larson state park superintendent said a team from the 
utah state prison was put on the outofcontrol blaze this morning 
and hoped to make headway against the fire before this afternoon 
when temperatures were expected to top 100 again 
he estimated that the fire has scorched about 6000 acres of 
grassland but said a plane would fly over the fire later today to 
get a better estimate 
were really concerned about it larson said its going 
through a lot of good grass that has just made a comeback in the 
last four years 
the island 7 miles long 1 mile wide and covering 28000 acres 
is mainly a state park although there are small parcels in private 
ownership the rising waters of the great salt lake inundated a 
causeway leading to the island several years ago forcing officials 
to close the park 
state wildlife biologists estimate that 600 buffalo live on the 
island along with mule deer bobcats and several species of 
migratory birds 
the fire was sparked by a series of drylightning storms that 
passed over northern utah on sunday temperatures in the salt lake 
city area reached 100 degrees on saturday and sunday and were 
expected to reach triple figures again today 
national weather service meteorologist bill alder said the 
broiling temperatures caused a series of micro bursts which 
are dry storms accompanied by lightning alder said wind speeds 
topped 60 mph in several locations on sunday and emergency lines 
were flooded with calls of power lines knocked down and power polls 
on fire 
theres no end in sight for the severe heat wave he said 
pete hansen an interagency fire center spokesman said 
lightning also set fire to a tree in the lone peak wilderness area 
on the southern end of the salt lake valley because the fire was 
in a wilderness area and naturally caused it would be allowed to 
burn although it would be monitored closely he said

donald trump would be put on a 450000amonth budget to get 
the 65 million bank loan he needs to see his way through a cash 
crunch newspapers reported today 
under the tentative deal the syndicate of banks would lend 
trump 65 million on the condition they be allowed to name two 
executives to run the trump empire 
the deal would prohibit trump from moving money among his 
companies without permission and put him on a personal budget of 
450000 a month this year less in subsequent years according to 
reports in the new york times and the philadelphia inquirer 
on june 15 trump missed a 43 million payment on bonds issued 
to finance the trump castle casino in atlantic city nj under a 
grace period he has until midnight tuesday before he can be 
declared in default 
a default on the castle bonds could trigger defaults on bank 
loans secured by other properties which could then be seized and 
it could affect his gaming license in new jersey 
a banker who spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press on sunday that a west german bank and a french bank hold the 
key to trumps hopes of raising the 65 million in the next two 
days 
trumps main banks citibank chase manhattan bankers trust 
and manufacturers hanover have agreed to the restructuring but 
dresdner bank ag and societe generale are balking at terms of the 
deal said the banker 
if they dont agree there wont be any deal said the 
source if theres no deal then either he comes up with the cash 
from some other source or he defaults and perhaps declares 
bankruptcy on the casino and related properties 
a 20 million bridge loan is being prepared to tide trump over 
while the paperwork for the larger loan is completed the times 
reported today 
the newspaper quoting unidentified bankers involved in the 
negotiations said before the 30day financing can be extended an 
agreement on the bigger loan must be obtained 
terms of the broad loan agreement include stringent restrictions 
on trumps personal and business finances the newspapers reported 
an allowance is certain to put a damper on the lifestyle trump 
enjoyed during the 1980s his playthings include a 284foot yacht 
a 118room florida mansion and a helicopter and a jet for his 
personal use 
the restrictions limit trumps monthly charitable contributions 
to 100000 and stipulate that his household and personal expenses 
not exceed 450000 a month for the rest of this year 375000 a 
month in 1991 and 300000 a month in 1992 
trump has been negotiating with the banks in recent weeks to 
restructure his debts and avert what could be a string of defaults 
in his real estate and casino empire 
under the proposed plan the banks would extend trump money to 
make overdue payments on the bond issue and suspend some payments 
on his 2 billion in bank loans in exchange for equity in some of 
his properties

secretary of defense dick cheney today 
rejected a soviet suggestion for withdrawing foreign troops from 
berlin 
the problem of course is once you take troops out of berlin 
youve still got berlin inside what is currently east germany 
surrounded by some 380000 soviet troops that are not leaving 
immediately cheney said in an interview on foxtv 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes suggested friday 
that 15000 british american french and soviet troops leave 
berlin six months after the germanys unite 
cheney said the united states was likely to follow instead the 
proposal of west german chancellor helmut kohl and others that us 
forces remain in berlin until soviet forces are out of eastern 
germany 
cheney also said the administration was prepared to reduce the 
defense budget in a cautious orderly fashion 
it ought to be done in connection with events as they develop 
in the outside world and shouldnt be done based upon wishful 
thinking he said 
shevardnadzes proposal which he outlined at a foreign 
ministers meeting in berlin also drew strong objections from 
secretary of states james a baker iii 
cheney said it was his job to remind people that we have to 
deal with the real world as we find it not as we hope it will 
change

pope john paul ii met for the first time 
today with the bishops of the ukrainian catholic church and hailed 
their emergence from more than four decades of soviet repression 
but he also urged them to make peace with the russian orthodox 
antagonists since the ukrainian church was suppressed by dictator 
josef stalin in 1946 to strengthen the role of christianity in a 
europe emerging from communist rule 
the ukrainians the pope said must be a bridge and in no way 
an obstacle to better relations among christians 
other hurdles to improved vaticankremlin ties have fallen under 
the leadership of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the ukrainian issue however has remained a stumbling block and 
differences between the ukrainians and the vatican have come to the 
surface 
in his speech to the bishops the pope appeared to be balancing 
his concern for the suffering of the ukrainian faithful on the 
cross of christ with the goals of the entire church 
stalin had forcibly merged the church with governmentcontrolled 
orthodox church bishops and priests who resisted were shot or 
imprisoned and its churches were taken over by the orthodox 
according to western estimates there are at least 4 million 
catholics in the ukraine until the kremlin recently softened its 
stance on religion they practiced their faith secretly 
bishops were named in secret and held regular jobs ranging from 
a worker on a collective farm to a university professor

almost as revealing as what some lobbyists report is what they 
dont 
last year california had an estimated 90 million reported 
spent by lobbyists 
yet in a loopholeridden state like pennsylvania lobbyists as a 
group reported spending 362000 thats a fraction of what was 
reported in smaller states like connecticut montana mississippi 
hawaii nebraska new hampshire south carolina kentucky and 
kansas the top lobbyist in at least five states reported spending 
more than was reported by pennsylvanias 799 lobbyists combined 
many former elected officials have found second careers as 
lobbyists among exgovernors representing special interest groups 
are marvin mandel of maryland and anthony earl and martin schreiber 
of wisconsin 
some of the best paid lobbyists make sixfigure incomes that are 
several times greater than even the highest paid legislators in 
maryland for instance lobbyist bruce bereano got more than 1 
million in fees from 53 clients in 1989 
the persuaders not surprisingly arent in favor of more 
reporting 
requiring a lobbyist to report doesnt make them honest or 
dishonest no lobbyist is going to report doing something 
illegal said hobson waits a lobbyist for the electric power 
associations of mississippi inc 
watchdogs agree but they say the point is the public interest 
would be best served if special interests reported in detail what 
they do to influence legislators 
weve cut the average citizen out of the process said barry 
kauffman of pennsylvania common cause 
its the contemporary golden rule those with the gold make 
the rules kauffman said people are turned off theyve passed 
apathy and gone to alienation its not their system anymore

estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
329 million down 12 percent from aprils rate of 333 million 
sales in april dropped 21 percent 
existing home sales have dropped each month since the first of 
the year except during march when they were unchanged they 
totaled 344 million in 1989 
mortgage rates on the other hand have generally declined since 
hitting doubledigit figures in january they dropped from 1067 
percent at the beginning of may to 1033 percent at months end 
according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp rates 
slipped to 1016 percent last friday 
mortgage rates also have crimped sales of new homes which 
dropped 16 percent in april the fifth straight monthly decline 
aprils seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546000 was the lowest 
level of sales since the recession year of 1982 
new home sales in may will post an increase when they are 
announced friday by the commerce department but growth is 
certain to be held back by mays unusually rainy chilly weather 
according to samuel d kahan chief economist with fuji securities 
inc 
nevertheless home sales may stabilize around their 
yeartodate pace in coming months as the market begins to digest 
the decline in mortgage lending rates he wrote in the government 
securities dealers current issue of perspectives 
john a tuccillo realtors chief economist has said mortgage 
rates will continue drifting downward through the summer although 
no sharp drops are expected

found in some sectors of the real estate industry mainly affects 
builders rather than home buyers

for joe cruzan and his family the 
legal fight to let their comatose daughter die is over now come 
the years of waiting while she lies attached to a hospital feeding 
tube 
the us supreme court barred the removal of her lifesustaining 
tube today in its first ruling in a righttodie case 
the court in a 54 decision said a states interest in 
preserving life may overcome the wishes of family members seeking 
to end the life of a patient in an irreversible comalike condition 
to the family the facts were painfully simple they wanted 
death to become a reality for 32yearold nancy who has been in a 
persistent vegetative state since a january 1983 car crash shes 
kept alive by a surgically implanted feeding tube at the missouri 
rehabilitation center in mount vernon 
doctors say she has no hope of recovery but could remain alive 
for many years 
a voice on the telephone answering machine at the home of joe 
and joyce cruzan in carterville mo said the family will have no 
response to the high courts decision until they have had time to 
analyze the ruling 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing the majority 
opinion said missouri may require clear and convincing proof 
that ms cruzan wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of 
lifesustaining treatment such evidence is lacking in ms cruzans 
case he said 
thats one of the arguments the state made which apparently 
the majority agrees with missouri attorney general william 
webster said 
webster reserved additional comment until he could review the 
ruling 
in a statement gov john ashcroft said he was grateful the 
court backed the states position he also said that our thoughts 
and prayers remain with the cruzan family 
dick kurtenbach executive director of the american civil 
liberties union in kansas city which had helped cruzans throughout 
their sevenyear court battle said the ruling is not a surprise 
given the courts recent decisions 
we were i guess hopeful mainly because the decision was 
obviously so important to the family its hard not to be hopeful 
under those circumstances he said 
but when we looked at it realistically and with the recent 
history of the court this is not that surprising he said 
for joe cruzan a sheet metal worker from carterville theres 
no doubt about what his daughter would have wanted 
she would say pull the plug stop it i dont want to live 
like this i have no dignity cruzan said in an interview last 
year 
if she had her way shed like to come back like she was 
thats what i wish but its not going to happen 
the legal fight began when the parents realized their daughters 
condition would not change and they asked doctors to remove the 
feeding tube so nancy could die the physicians refused and in 
october 1987 the family asked the jasper county circuit court for 
permission to carry out their wishes 
nancy had left no written instructions about what she would want 
done under such circumstances 
circuit judge charles teel ruled in july 1988 that the family 
could have the feeding tube removed webster appealed 
the case went to the missouri supreme court which overturned 
teels ruling in november 1988 
the family then took its case to the us supreme court 
meanwhile missouri lawmakers this year tried to change the law 
so the feeding tube could be removed from someone like nancy the 
missouri catholic conference and others lobbied hard against it and 
the efforts failed 
m rose gasner director of legal services for new yorkbased 
society for the right to die said although were sorry for the 
cruzans in terms of the decisions effect on the law well just 
have to keep doing what weve been doing which is working state by 
state to get laws passed

perrier water is back on grocery store 
shelves after the recent contamination scare but a new problem has 
come bubbling to the surface 
a new jersey dairy has complained that retailers used milk 
crates to get rid of their perrier when it was recalled in 
february now farmland dairy wants its crates back and it has 
gone to court to get them 
marc goldman president of farmland said more than 50000 of 
his milk crates worth about 3 each were not returned by a 
warehouse that perrier had contracted to dispose of the water and 
recycle the bottles 
i can understand the scramble on the first day of the recall 
but its not like they called us and said we have your cases we 
had to catch them goldman said 
a spokesman for the warehouse said it has agreed to return the 
farmland crates in its possession and that goldman was 
overreacting a spokeswoman for the perrier group in greenwich 
conn said it was doing everything possible to have the crates 
returned 
farmland filed a criminal complaint against distribution 
warehouse amp service corp after finding crates at the companys 
storage center in elizabeth the warehouse was hired by the perrier 
group to store perrier bottles collected throughout the new york 
metropolitan area spokeswoman jane lazgin said 
charges also were lodged against rei recycling of newark which 
also had farmland milk crates rei officials could not be reached 
for comment because there was no telephone listing for the company 
goldman said he was preparing to file additional complaints 
because he suspected some of the plastic milk crates were shredded 
and recycled distribution warehouse vice president robert 
kortenhaus said that claim was ridiculous 
perrier recalled all its water worldwide feb 9 after traces of 
the chemical benzene were found in some bottles it returned to the 
us market in april

fears that an epidemic of contagious disease 
will sweep through the bodies that remain unburied after irans 
earthquake are unfounded health officials say 
at least 50000 people were reported killed in the earthquake 
that struck thursday iranian officials said they are worried about 
the danger of infectious diseases and contamination of the water 
supply in part because of unburied bodies 
officials of the us centers for disease control in atlanta say 
that diseases such as typhoid and cholera simply do not occur after 
disasters even in the absence of vaccinations 
typhoid vaccine for example which was given to rescue workers 
after the mexico city earthquake in 1985 does no good officials 
said the reasons are that it offers only partial protection in 
some people and the partial protection begins only after several 
weeks 
typhoid vaccine also can cause fever pain and headaches and 
vaccination diverts humans resources from the work of caring for 
earthquake victims officials said 
the only health threat that decomposing bodies might present is 
possible contamination of drinking water if the bodies are in 
contact with the water doctors said 
such contamination of the water supply is considered highly 
unlikely officials said

chinas bestknown dissidents physicists fang 
lizhi and his wife li shuxian left the country for britain today 
after communist authorities allowed them to end their yearlong 
refuge in the us embassy 
the white house immediately hailed beijings move as a 
humanitarian action that will better uschinese ties 
the 54yearold astrophysicist and his wife had sought refuge in 
the embassy after the june 4 1989 military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement 
the official xinhua news agency said they were given permission 
to leave the country for medical reasons after showing signs of 
repentance 
it said the move was in line with chinas policy of leniency 
towards those who participated in the disturbances of last june 
since late last year china has announced the release of more 
than 800 people jailed for their participation in the democracy 
movement but it is believed that thousands more remain in jail 
fang and li were bound for britain aboard a us c135 air 
transport 
the plane stopped briefly at elmendorf air force base in 
anchorage alaska early today and transferred to another military 
plane with a fresh crew the couple waved to onlookers but made no 
comments as they transferred planes said maj doug mccoy an air 
force spokesman 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said fang and li would 
arrive in london early tuesday he said fang had accepted a job at 
cambridge university 
this humanitarian action is a farsighted significant step 
that will improve the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral 
relations he said in a statement adding that president bush was 
informed of the development late sunday 
he did not disclose when or how the agreement to allow the 
couple free passage had been reached 
fang has been chinas most outspoken and eloquent proponent of 
democratic reform he and li were well known for their advocacy of 
democracy and human rights in china well before the sevenweek 
prodemocracy movement gelled 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military 
assault on central beijing and thousands of activists were 
subsequently arrested fang and li did not play an active role in 
the studentled protests but after the crackdown the the communist 
government accused them of inciting the unrest 
they took refuge in the us embassy in the days following the 
crackdown and american diplomats refused to turn them over to 
chinese authorities washington also imposed sanctions that cut 
shipments of military hardware and uschinese relations 
deteriorated 
their release appeared timed by the chinese for maximum 
political results the seven leading industrialized nations are to 
hold their annual meeting july 911 in houston and policy toward 
china is to be a major subject 
congress is also debating bushs decision last month to extend 
mostfavorednation trading status to china for another year the 
fang case has been cited by some members of congress demanding 
revocation of the status which reduces tariffs on chinese goods 
sold in the united states 
chinese authorities had said that in order to be released fang 
and li would have to confess guilt and promise not to carry out 
any antigovernment activities 
xinhua said the two had recently admitted in writing that they 
have opposed socialist principles and the leadership of the 
communist party thus violating the countrys constitution it also 
said the two had agreed not to engage in activities directed 
against china 
the report did not say what their medical problems were their 
son fang ke a student at wayne state university in detroit said 
earlier this month that his parents were in good spirits and 
continued their scientific work in the embassy 
i am happy to see the very real possibility for me in the near 
future to see them he said today 
fang ke said he doubted the chinese governments explanation 
that his parents were allowed to leave because they had repudiated 
their role in the democracy movement and needed medical care he 
said he had kept in touch with them by letter and that they were 
not particularly ill 
fang has another son in beijing fang zhe a student at beijing 
university in britain a foreign office spokesman said fang had 
received an invitation from the royal society britains oldest and 
most prestigious scientific organization 
however fang and his wife li shuxian would enter the country 
on a sixmonth visa the standard time granted any tourist the 
foreign office said 
fang was expelled from the communist party and fired from his 
post as vice chairman of the chinese science and technology 
university in hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting prodemocracy 
unrest among the nations students 
he also angered authorities when he told reporters that marxism 
had failed in china and that the communist party must make way for 
democratic reform 
in january 1989 fang called for the release of all political 
prisoners and urged intellectuals to join together to work for 
human rights 
the following month when bush was visiting beijing fang was 
barred from attending a usstaged banquet china said that 
inviting him was an insult 
while being sheltered at the embassy fang and li declined to 
talk with reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all 
questions about them 
in november however fang wrote a letter accepting a human 
rights award 
remember that in the current climate of terror it may well be 
that those who are most terrified are those who have just finished 
the killing he wrote 
we may be forced to live under a terror today but we have no 
fear of tomorrow the murderers are not only fearful today they 
are even more terrified of tomorrow 
the release of another dissident teacher wang xuezhi was also 
announced today wang is the husband of a french citizen

the supreme court ruled today that states may 
require notification of one parent when unmarried girls seek an 
abortion but it said mandating notification of both parents may 
interfere with the constitutional right to abortion 
the justices voted 63 to uphold an ohio law requiring that one 
parent be notified we discern no constitutional defect in the 
statute justice anthony m kennedy wrote 
the court by a 54 vote struck down one version of a minnesota 
law requiring notification of both parents by another 54 vote 
with justice sandra day oconnor changing sides the court ruled 
constitutional a version that allows a minor to notify either both 
her parents or get a judges permission 
justice john paul stevens wrote the opinion for the court 
striking down the twoparent notification law 
this requirement ostensibly designed for the benefit of the 
minor resulted in major trauma to the child and often to a parent 
as well stevens said in some cases the parents were divorced 
and the second parent did not have custody or otherwise participate 
in the childs upbringing 
dissenting kennedy wrote that to deny parents this knowledge 
is to risk or perpetuate estrangement or alienation from the 
child when she is in the greatest need of parental guidance and 
support 
but in upholding the twoparent notification rule only if a 
judicial bypass option is included oconnor said the 
interference with the internal operation of the family no longer 
exists 
kennedy writing for the court in the ohio case noted that the 
state law allows a minor to notify a judge rather than her parents 
if she wants an abortion this he said shows an abundance of 
caution and concern for the minors interets 
he noted that todays decisions leave unanswered a key question 
whether a state law that requires notification of one parent can be 
constitutional if it does not include a judicial bypass option 
todays action did not appear to carry major impact for the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
oconnor is viewed as a pivotal vote on the future of that 
decision today marked the first time since joining the court in 
1981 that she voted to strike down a stateimposed restriction on 
abortion 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said the court has thrown down the gauntlet before the young 
women and girls of america state legislators have been given the 
green light to restrict the choices of pregnant teens whose 
desperation the politicians can never comprehend 
gary bauer an antiabortion leader and former reagan 
administration official who is president of the family research 
council said in our view these two cases represent further 
evidence that roe v wade will sometime soon slip into the history 
books as an illfated supreme court decision 
while both the ohio and minnesota laws require parental 
notification of a minors plan to get an abortion neither mandates 
parental consent thus a girl could get an abortion over her 
parents objections provided that notification was made 
the courts decisions in the ohio and minnesota cases yielded 
nine separate opinions they offered a patchwork of rationale for 
upholding the ohio law in its entirety but striking down the 
minnesota law unless a judicial bypass is included 
the decisions hold these nationwide guidelines on the regulation 
of abortions for unmarried minor girls still dependent on one or 
both parents 
a law requiring that only one parent be notified is 
constitutional 
states may not require that in all cases both natural parents 
be notified before an abortion is performed 
a law requiring that both parents be notified can be 
constitutional if it also allows a girl to bypass parental 
notification by getting a judges permission for an abortion 
a requirement in the minnesota law that parents be notified 
at least 48 hours before an abortion is performed is 
constitutionally valid 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices oconnor 
stevens antonin scalia kennedy and byron r white voted to uphold 
the ohio law requiring notification of one parent 
a provision in the minnesota law that would have required 
twoparent notification in all cases was struck down by oconnor 
stevens justices william j brennan harry a blackmun and 
thurgood marshall 
but oconnor left those four in providing the fifth vote for 
saying that minnesotas twoparent requirement is valid if 
accompanied by the judical bypass option 
of the 15 million legal abortions performed annually since 
1973 about 12 percent some 180000 a year have been for minors 
twentytwo states have enacted laws that require a minor to seek 
the consent of one or both parents before obtaining an abortion 
and 10 states have enacted laws that require a minor to notify one 
or both parents before obtaining an abortion not all of the laws 
are in force however 
the minnesota law enacted in 1981 required that the minors 
two biological parents be notified there was no exception for 
mature minors or for those whose parents are divorced or were 
never married 
the minnesota law was in effect for five years before being 
ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge a federal appeals court 
later ruled that the law is valid but blocked its enforcement 
pending supreme court review 
the judicial bypass procedure was added to the minnesota law in 
an attempt to fend off a finding that the statute was 
unconstitutional 
the ohio law requires that one of a minors parents be notified 
by a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed the 
girl can avoid telling her parent if she persuades a judge she is 
mature enough to make the decision on her own or that telling her 
parents is not in her best interest 
the ohio law enacted in 1985 never took effect due to a 
successful legal challenge by an akron abortion clinic and one of 
its doctors 
the justices previously have allowed limits on the availability 
of abortions for minors 
the court in upholding key portions of a missouri abortion law 
gave states last july greater power to regulate abortions 
rehnquist white scalia and kennedy appeared ready then to reverse 
roe vs wade and allow states to ban virtually all abortions 
but oconnor who joined those four to uphold the missouri law 
refused to reverse the 1973 ruling 
today kennedy led four of the courts members rehnquist 
scalia and white joined him in saying states should be allowed to 
ban abortions for all minors unless both parents are notified if 
such notification is possible 
kennedy said the courts striking down of the minnesota 
provision no doubt will come as a surprise to most parents 
he added minnesota has done no more than act upon the common 
sense proposition that in assisting their daughter in deciding 
whether to have an abortion parents can best fulfill their roles 
if they have the same information about their own childrens 
medical condition and medical choices as the childs doctor does 
blackmun brennan and marshall dissented from the decision 
upholding ohios law 
blackmun wrote for the three ohio has acted with particular 
insensitivity in enacting the statute the court today upholds 
rather than create a judicialbypass system that reflects the 
sensitivity necessary when dealing with a minor making this deeply 
initimate decision ohio has created a tortuous maze 
he added the state has failed utterly to show that it has any 
significant state interest in deliberately placing its pattern of 
obstacles in the path of the pregnant minor seeking to exercise her 
constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy 
the cases are ohio vs akron center for reproductive health 
88805 and hodgson vs minnesota 881125

a new word has quietly slipped into the 
vocabulary of doctors and scientists who are on the battle lines 
against aids optimism 
with 130000 already sick or dead and at least 1 million 
infected aids is a huge health problem in the united states but 
for the first time since the epidemic emerged almost a decade ago 
experts seem uniformly convinced that aids will someday and 
perhaps soon be brought under medical control 
researchers at the sixth international conference on aids which 
concluded sunday pointed to these hopeful signs 
the epidemic in the united states appears to be leveling off 
the number of new aids deaths is sharply lower than what 
researchers a few years ago had projected it would be by now 
many new drugs are in the works that will attack the aids virus 
at every stage of its life cycle combinations of medicines may be 
powerful tools for postponing or halting the development of aids in 
people infected with the virus hiv 
creating an aids vaccine to stop infections until recently 
considered a questionable prospect appears to be much more likely 
during the 1990s 
there is a fair amount of optimism with the current drugs and 
this will be added to when we have other drugs to combine with 
them said the conference chairman dr paul volberding of the 
university of california san francisco 
despite the positive developments during the past year no one 
is talking seriously about curing aids instead the goal is to 
turn hiv infection into a manageable chronic condition like 
diabetes or high blood pressure 
awesome obstacles remain 
the virus continues to move beyond its initial victims 
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers 
in the united states women and children are increasingly 
becoming targets as hiv spreads through sex from men to women and 
in the womb from mothers to fetuses around the world perhaps 8 
million people are already infected and the epidemic still seems 
to be gaining momentum 
hiv is now part of the global environment and the global 
potential for hiv spread remains vast cautioned jonathan mann 
former head of the world health associations global program on 
aids 
the present is indeed gloomy but at this gathering more than 
any previous international aids meeting the researchers spoke of 
their successes and the chance that they will ultimately stop the 
epidemic 
one crucial weapon is a vaccine that will keep people who are 
still virus free from becoming infected more than 30 approaches to 
vaccine development are being studied half a dozen potential 
vaccines already are being tested on people or nearing that stage 
dr wayne koff head of vaccine development at the national 
institute on allergy and infectious diseases predicted that a 
vaccine should be ready for widespread use by the mid to late 
1990s 
in the past year we have cracked open the door of optimism 
he said in the next two to three years we will knock it down 
now only one drug azt is available for routine use while it 
does not cure aids it can prolong patients lives by a few months 
perhaps even more useful is its ability to forestall the start of 
aids in outwardly healthy people who are infected with hiv 
two similar drugs ddi and ddc are in the final stages of 
testing new research suggests that combinations of these drugs 
will be far more powerful inhibitors of the virus than any single 
medicine and dozens of new drugs are being tested 
researchers once predicted that the number of aids deaths would 
continue to grow sharply for years but to their surprise the 
epidemic began to flatten in 1986 and perhaps earlier 
no one knows precisely why it happened or whether the epidemic 
will pick up speed again however the introduction of azt and 
avoidance of risky habits that spread the disease probably 
contributed to the change 
doctors hope that all of these developments mean that the 
epidemic while far from over will soon lose some of its fierce 
power 
as dr jay levy of the university of california san francisco 
told the convention we have begun to see the horizon and we 
will get there

here are excerpts from the supreme court 
decisions issued monday striking down a minnesota law requiring 
unmarried girls to notify both parents before getting an abortion 
and upholding an ohio law requiring notification of one parent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the ohio statute in sum does not impose an undue or 
otherwise unconstitutional burden on a minor seeking an abortion 
we believe in addition that the legislature acted in a rational 
manner in enacting the law 
a free and enlightened society may decide that each of its 
members should attain a clearer more tolerant understanding of the 
profound philosophic choices confronted by a woman who is 
considering whether to seek an abortion 
her decision will embrace her own destiny and personal dignity 
and the origins of the other human life that lie within the embryo 
the state is entitled to assume that for most of its people the 
beginnings of that understanding will be within the family 
societys most intimate association 
it is both rational and fair for the state to conclude that in 
most instances the family will strive to give a lonely or even 
terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature the 
statute in issue here is a rational way to further those ends 
it would deny all dignity to the family to say that the state 
cannot take this reasonable step in regulating its health 
professions to ensure that in most cases a young woman will 
receive guidance and understanding from a parent we uphold the 
law

the state of ohio has acted with particular insensitivity in 
enacting the statute the court today upholds rather than create a 
judicialbypass system that reflects the sensitivity necessary when 
dealing with a minor making this deeply intimate decision ohio has 
created a tortuous maze 
moreover the state has failed utterly to show that it has 
any significant state interest in deliberately placing its pattern 
of obstacles in the path of the pregnant minor seeking to exercise 
her constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy 
the challenged provisions of the ohio statute are merely 
poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion 
decision

it is equally clear that the requirement that both parents be 
notified whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed 
responsibility for the upbringing of the child does not reasonably 
further any legitimate state interest 
in the ideal family setting of course notice to either 
parent would normally constitute notice to both in many 
families however the parent notified by the child would not 
notify the other parent in those cases the state has no legitimate 
interest in questioning one parents judgment that notice to the 
other parent would not assist the minor or in presuming that the 
parent who has assumed parental duties is incompetent to make 
decisions regarding the health and welfare of the child 
not only does twoparent notification fail to serve any 
state interest with respect to functioning families it disserves 
the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with 
respect to dysfunctional families 
the record reveals that in the thousands of dysfunctional 
families affected by this statute the twoparent notice 
requirement proved positively harmful to the minor and her family 
the testimony at trial established that this requirement 
ostensibly designed for the benefit of the minor resulted in major 
trauma to the child and often to a parent as well in some cases 
the parents were divorced and the second parent did not have 
custody or otherwise participate in the childs upbringing in 
these circumstances the privacy of the parent and child was 
violated even when they suffered no other physical or 
psychological harm 
in other instances however the second parent had either 
deserted or abused the child had died under tragic 
circumstances or was not notified because of the considered 
judgment that notification would inflict unnecessary stress on a 
parent who was ill in these circumstances the statute was not 
merely ineffectual in achieving the states goals but actually 
counterproductive the focus on notifying the second parent 
distracted both the parent and minor from the minors imminent 
abortion decision 
in virtually every state the consent of one parent is 
enough to obtain a drivers license or operators permit the same 
may be said with respect to the decision to submit to any medical 
or surgical procedure other than an abortion indeed the only 
other minnesota statute that the state has identified which 
requires twoparent consent is that authorizing the minor to change 
his name 
these statutes provide testimony to the unreasonableness of 
the minnesota twoparent notification requirement and to the ease 
with which the state can adopt less burdensome means to protect the 
minors welfare 
we therefore hold that this requirement violates the 
constitution

several hundred inmates staged an angry 
uprising this morning at the states minimum security prison 
setting two buildings ablaze and injuring at least one guard who 
was hit by a rock authorities said 
the disturbance at the carl robinson correctional institution 
started about 715 am when protesting inmates refused to return 
to their dormitories after breakfast the disturbance was mostly 
quelled by early afternoon said correction department spokesman 
william wheeler 
an estimated 400 inmates took part in the protest throwing 
rocks breaking windows wrenching doors off their hinges and 
breaking into the prisons main mess hall and a second building 
housing a mess hall and gymnasium wheeler said 
the two buildings were set ablaze and sustained heavy damage 
wheeler said the inmates also looted the prison commissary housed 
in the same building as the main mess hall he said 
the inmates have been complaining the food and the wages paid at 
their prison jobs wheeler said prison officials also have been 
struggling to accommodate an inmate population that has ballooned 
in the past year from 750 to the current 1350 
most of the inmates were returned to their dormitories by 1230 
pm but a handful remained in the yard and authorities were 
awaiting word from warden george bronson before taking the prison 
off alert status wheeler said 
i cant say that its totally under control but the 
overwhelming majority returned to their housing units and a count 
is going on wheeler said 
a guard suffered a broken ankle when he was struck by a rock 
thrown by an inmate wheeler said a number of inmates complained 
of miscellaneous injuries including smoke inhalation cuts and 
bruises he said 
there were no escapes wheeler said

incident wheeler said the correction officers were in 
control the inmates were in the yard

police dogs were dispatched to help quell the disturbance they 
were kept on standby at a staging area about a quarter mile from

the supreme court in its first ruling in a 
righttodie case said today states may bar the removal of 
lifesustaining treatment from comatose patients who have not made 
or cannot make their desires known 
in other decisions the court ruled that states may require 
notification of one parent when unmarried girls seek an abortion 
but it said mandating notification of both parents interferes with 
the constitutional right to abortion 
by a 54 vote the justices blocked the parents of a permanently 
unconscious missouri woman nancy cruzan from ordering the removal 
of tubes that provide her with food and water 
the court said ms cruzans rights were not violated by allowing 
the states interest in preserving life to outweigh her parents 
wishes 
but the court indirectly supporting socalled living will 
laws said the constitution guarantees a competent person a right 
to refuse medical treatment that issue was not presented squarely 
in the cruzan case since she is incompetent to decide her future 
the court said 
in the abortion decisions the justices voted 63 to uphold an 
ohio law requiring that one parent be notified we discern no 
constitutional defect in the statute justice anthony m kennedy 
wrote 
the court by a 54 vote struck down one version of a minnesota 
law requiring notification of both parents by another 54 vote 
with justice sandra day oconnor changing sides the court ruled 
constitutional a version that allows a minor to either notify both 
her parents or get the approval of a judge 
the parents of ms cruzan joe and joyce cruzan left a message 
on the answering machine at their carterville mo home that the 
family will have no reaction until they have had time to analyze 
the ruling 
but dick kurtenbach who has worked with the cruzans as head of 
the kansas city mo office of the american civil liberties union 
commented 
when we looked at it realistically and with the recent 
history of the court this is not that surprising 
im sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed 
speaking for the american medical association dr nancy dickey 
a richmond texas family physician and a trustee of the ama said 
of the decision 
we feel it is an intrusion into the doctorpatient 
relationship and a step toward taking that decision away from the 
bedside we should not deliver unnecessary care and pay for 
unnecessary care 
dickey spoke with reporters at an ama policymaking conference in 
chicago 
doctors have said ms cruzan 32 could live for 30 more years 
in her current persistent vegetative condition 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
missouri may require clear and convincing proof that ms cruzan 
wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of lifesustaining 
treatment such evidence is lacking in ms cruzans case he said 
the chief justice also said that not all incompetent patients 
will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate 
decisionmakers a state is entitled to guard against potential 
abuses in such situations 
in sum we conclude that a state may apply a clear and 
convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks 
to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be 
in a persistent vegetative state rehnquist said 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin j scalia and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
brennan in an opinion joined by marshall and blackmun said 
nancy cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity 
missouri and the supreme court have displaced nancys own 
assessment of the processes associated with dying brennan said 
they have discarded evidence of her will ignored her values 
and deprived her of the right to a decision as closely 
approximating her own choice as humanly possible 
but brennan said he is heartened that the court tentatively 
concluded that in some cases a competent person must be allowed to 
choose death 
state courts generally have permitted removal of lifesustaining 
treatment for patients like ms cruzan until today the supreme 
court had declined to step in 
todays ruling does not bar state courts or state legislatures 
from continuing to allow the removal of lifesustaining treatment 
even for incompetent persons 
most states including missouri have socalled living will laws 
that allow people to authorize the termination of lifesustaining 
treatment before they undergo such treatment missouris 
livingwill law which does not allow removal of feeding tubes was 
not in effect when ms cruzan was injured in a 1983 car crash 
the american medical association estimates 70 percent of 
americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether 
to provide lifesustaining medical care for themselves or family 
members 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage her parents authorized 
the use of a feeding tube in hopes her condition would improve 
but for seven years she has remained in a comalike condition 
her body rigid her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw 
shapes she can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are open 
and move randomly 
doctors say she is incapable of reacting or relating to her 
environment and can experience no thoughts or emotions 
nurses at the rehabilitation center where ms cruzan is being 
cared for dispute that they said she responds by turning toward 
those who speak to her and has cried on occasion 
the cost to missouri taxpayers of keeping ms cruzan alive is 
about 130000 a year 
the bush administration sided with missouri officials in urging 
she be kept alive permitting the removal of a feeding tube is a 
step toward sanctioning mercy killing or suicide justice 
department lawyers said 
debate over the case also has spilled over into the abortion 
controversy antiabortion activists had said a court determination 
that lifesustaining treatment may be withdrawn based on a 
constitutional right of privacy would jeopardize efforts to curtail 
abortions 
the missouri supreme court in 1988 bucking a trend among courts 
nationwide refused to let doctors remove ms cruzans feeding 
tube the state court rejected a plea by ms cruzans parents who 
said their daughter once had said she would not want to remain 
alive as an unconscious shell 
the righttodie issue captured national attention in 1976 when 
the new jersey supreme court allowed the family of karen ann 
quinlan to order the removal of a respirator helping her breathe 
ms quinlan in a similar comalike condition to that of ms 
cruzan continued to be fed through a tube and lived nine more 
years

many of last years accidental shooting deaths 
of children could have been prevented by use of a new gun lock that 
will be provided at cost to nonprofit groups a shotgun 
manufacturer said monday 
the deaths of 247 children aged 14 and under last year from 
accidents with firearms left around the house is a tough 
statistic said alan i mossberg president of of mossberg amp 
sons inc the nations largest producer of pumpaction shotguns 
cablelock which is threaded through a guns action to make it 
inoperable is produced by mossberg and has been included at no 
extra charge with the estimated 250000 mossberg shotguns sold 
since last october he said 
the lock can be used on about 80 percent of the estimated 200 
million handguns rifles and shotguns owned by americans mossberg 
said 
some 15000 locks have been sold separately since december said 
richard m pelton executive vice president of the company 
although the recommended retail price is 695 the locks will 
be available this year to nonprofit groups at the companys cost 
of 246 apiece to boost their use mossberg said he suggested 
that the groups could use them as a fundraising tool 
mossberg said his company based in north haven conn is not 
trying to make a profit on the lock which has not been patented 
he said the company also is developing model federal and state 
legislation that would make it a crime not to lock up a firearm 
specific penalties have not yet been determined mossberg said 
people arent doing it otherwise those 247 children last year 
wouldnt have met with the tragic end that they did he said 
we think its got to be a subject of mandatory activity

consultation in most cases but providing for prompt i judicial 
resolution of any disagreement between the parent and the minor or 
ii judicial determination that the minor is mature enough to give 
an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion 
in any event is in the minors best interest 
such a provision would not impose parental approval as an 
absolute condition upon the minors right but would assure in most 
instances consultation between the parent and child 
</TEXT>

i dissent from the judgment of the court that the 
judicial bypass option renders the parental notification and 
48hour delay requirements constitutional the bypass procedure 
cannot sae those requirements because the bypass itself is 
unconstitutional both on its face and as applied 
at the very least this scheme substantially burdens a 
womans right to privacy without advancing a compelling state 
interest more significantly in some instances it usurps a young 
womans control over her own body by giving either a parent or a 
court the power effectively to veto her decision to have an 
abortion 
i strongly disagree with the courts conclusion that the 
state may constitutionally force a minor woman either to notify 
both parents or in some cases only one parent and then wait 48 
hours before proceeding with an abortion or disclose her intimate 
affairs to a judge and ask that he grant her permission to have an 
abortion 
neither the scope of a womans privacy right nor the magnitude 
of a laws burden is diminished because a woman is a minor 
rather a womans minority status affects only the nature of the 
states interests although the court considers the burdens that 
the twoparent notification requirement imposes on a minor womans 
exercise of her right to privacy it fails to recognize that 
forced notification of only one parent also significantly burdens a 
young womans right to have an abortion

chinese dissident fang lizhi spent more than a year inside the 
us embassy in beijing protected by international law that 
declares an embassy sacrosanct property belonging to the country of 
representation 
according to the law forces from the outside cannot legally 
enter an embassy to seize a person 
however an embassys right to grant sanctuary to someone does 
not mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country 
gen manuel antonio noriega took refuge in the vatican embassy 
in panama city last december after us troops invaded the country 
in an effort to bring him to the united states to face drug 
charges noriega left the embassy jan 3 and surrendered to us 
authorities he is in miami awaiting trial 
fang sought refuge in the us embassy in beijing after chinas 
communist government targeted him during its june 1989 crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters lizhi and his wife li shuxian were 
allowed to leave the embassy monday and flew to britain 
perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy 
involved hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty who hid for 15 years 
at the us embassy in budapest he was arrested by hungarys 
communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to 
life in prison 
hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising 
but mindszenty took refuge in the us mission in budapest after 
warsaw pact forces crushed the revolt he lived there until the 
vatican arranged for his release to the west in 1971 
elsewhere in the east bloc seven pentecostalists claiming 
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the 
us embassy in moscow leaving in 1983 
 
thousands of east germans seeking to go west took refuge in 
various west german embassies in september leading to a 
prodemocracy campaign that forced the lifting of travel 
restrictions toppled the communist government and ultimately 
spread across the east bloc 
the largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy 
at once may have been in cuba in april 1980 when 10000 cubans 
entered the grounds of the peruvian embassy seeking to emigrate 
cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home and 
eventually almost all of them received exit visas 
in 1973 after salvador allende was overthrown as president of 
chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace his widow 
and her children received refuge in the mexican embassy in 
santiago the mexican government then flew them out of the country

abortionrights activists voiced alarm monday 
at the supreme court decision upholding a parentalnotification law 
and called the vote a threat to abortion rights in general 
this was too close for comfort said kate michelman 
executive director of national abortion rights action league the 
threat to overturning this right is as close as the next supreme 
court vacancy 
antiabortion leaders however said they were pleased with the 
rulings involving ohio and minnesota laws 
gary bauer president of the antiabortion family research 
council said the 17yearold roe vs wade decision that legalized 
abortions was in jeopardy 
were very gratified bauer said 
the court voted 63 to uphold an ohio law requiring that one 
parent be notified before a minor girl obtains an abortion 
however a minnesota law requiring notification of both parents 
was struck down on a 54 vote by another 54 vote with justice 
sandra day oconnor changing sides the court ruled constitutional 
a version that allows a minor to notify either both her parents or 
get a judges permission 
in our view bauer said these two cases represent further 
evidence that roe vs wade will sometime soon slip into the history 
books as an illfated supreme court decision 
james bopp jr general counsel for the national right to life 
committee said the rulings were in line with the courts decision 
last year in the webster case permitting some state restrictions on 
abortion 
the court is prepared to further restrict abortion he said 
as far as i can see the state legislatures have basically carte 
blanche to regulate abortion as long as there is a rational reason 
or legitimate issue advanced in doing so 
michelman head of the national abortionrights group called 
the decisions extremely alarming and pointed to oconnors 
switch in the two minnesota votes as well as the wording of her 
written opinion 
as if allowing states to treat teens like criminals were not 
enough justice oconnor in her concurring opinion once again 
signaled her willingness to overturn roe vs wade by joining 
the others to undermine the right for all women she said 
michelman said she was concerned that oconnors opinion 
suggested any restriction on abortion which does not in her view 
pose an undue burden would be constitutional and that there is 
no fundamental right to an abortion 
the implication of this decision goes well beyond the narrow 
issue of parental notification and consent she said they 
failed completely to reaffirm roe vs wade 
at least 22 states have laws that require a minor to have the 
consent of one or both parents before having an abortion and 10 
states have enacted laws that require a minor to notify one or both 
parents before obtaining an abortion many were not in force 
because of court challenges however 
according to the national abortion rights action league 
parental consent laws were being enforced in alabama indiana 
louisiana massachusetts missouri north dakota rhode island 
south carolina utah and wyoming 
notification laws were enforced in arkansas and west virginia 
the group said 
legislatures in at least 22 states considered bills requiring 
parental consent or notification of their parents during the 1990 
legislative sessions a bill requiring a parents consent was 
passed in south carolina and signed into law while a bill passed 
in michigan was vetoed by gov jim blanchard 
michelman said those favoring abortion rights should be 
concerned by the narrowness of the 54 ruling against minnesotas 
law requiring both parents be notified she said that requirement 
was the most extreme burdensome and onerous requirement on a 
teenager in trouble 
the result she said amounted to an invitation to state 
legislatures to intrude in the most personal and private 
decisions individuals will make 
i think roe is seriously weakened she said we cant even 
call this a hollow victory

irrational fears about chemicals and food 
safety could drive up the costs of farm production and lead to 
higher prices at the grocery store a senior agriculture department 
official said monday 
if we react carelessly without science in response to 
imagined risks and thereby needlessly increase food costs the 
poor will be the first to notice reduced buying power and higher 
nutrition costs said deputy secretary jack c parnell 
the efficiency of farmers productivity has more than doubled 
in the last 40 years he said and chemicals have played a role in 
this american victory over hunger 
parnells remarks were prepared for a conference on food safety 
and nutrition sponsored by a number of governmment agencies 
including usda and the food and drug administration 
the conferences primarily for journalists have been held 
periodically over the years in 1988 for example three were held 
in washington chicago and san francisco to help spread the latest 
word on food and nutrition 
parnell who was director of the california department of food 
and agriculture before becoming the departments no 2 official 
last year said it has been american agriculture through 
inexpensive food that has helped enormously to raise our standard 
of living and that of many others around the world 
on the whole americans spend about 12 percent of their 
disposable income for food of which nearly 5 percent is for food 
eaten in restaurants and other places away from home 
by comparison he said japan spends almost 20 percent of its 
takehome pay for food the soviet union more than 25 percent and 
china and india over half of their income 
but parnell said he has noticed there is a group of americans 
who are not always remembered in the debate about the safety of 
the nations food supply 
those are poorer americans who spend a much larger share of 
their budgets on food he said there are millions of 
americans perhaps over 30 million americans who spend over 50 
percent of their income on food 
foreign countries including poor third world nations also 
would feel the pinch parnell said 
these are more good reasons to act as quickly as the threat 
demands to the extent the danger requires but avoid alarmist 
calls for excessive or selfdefeating policies he said

nelson mandela said today that south african 
blacks may have no alternative but to resort to violence to 
achieve racial equality as president bush urged the black leader to 
pursue his goals through peaceful means 
mandela praised us support for the fight against apartheid 
describing its value as beyond words and said he would press 
his case for continued economic sanctions against south africa 
during his official talks with bush 
the deputy president of the african national congress said his 
group is committed to achieving its ends peacefully but he 
indicated its patience was not without limits 
if we are forced to resort to violence it is because we have 
no other alternative he said the methods of political action 
were determined by the south african government 
leaving the white house after three hours mandela told 
reporters he was very much encouraged by the response and 
support bush gave him during their talks he said the two discussed 
a wide variety of issues and we reached broad agreement on 
almost all of them 
on the issues over which they disagreed mandela said he and the 
president narrowed the gaps but the african leader refused to 
provide any detail about the differences saying he would take 
questions later at a press conference 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen briefing on mandelas 
discussions with bush said us officials were pleased that 
mandela has said violence will be suspended so long as negotiations 
continue with the white government 
but he said us officials pressed mandela to go all the way 
and renounce the armed struggle mandela said he would consider 
that option cohen said everything he has said is fine cohen 
said 
earlier bush pledged continued support for the black majority 
in south africa and called for all parties to work through 
negotiations not armed struggle to achieve a democractic 
society 
sir we here in america walk in solidarity with all the south 
africans who seek through nonviolent means democracy human rights 
and freedom bush said 
bush also said the united states will maintain sanctions until 
the white government of president fw de klerk meets all 
conditions spelled out in an antiapartheid law those conditions 
have yet to be met 
earlier us officials said 10 million that congress has 
allocated for south african groups cannot go to the anc until it 
renounces violence 
while his previous stops in new york and boston were largely 
celebratory with hundreds of thousands of supporters attending 
enthusiastic rallies mandela got down to business during his 
threeday visit to washington 
on sunday mandela told black reporters that economic sanctions 
were vital in softening the south african governments hard line on 
apartheid 
it is therefore necessary for you to continue to put on the 
pressure on your government and on congress said mandela who 
was freed in february after being imprisoned for 27 years by the 
south african government 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen said the main us 
emphasis was to find out mandelas views on how to proceed with 
negotiations between the anc and the south african government 
the us sanctions which have had a harsh impact on the south 
african economy include a ban on all new us investment and trade 
embargoes on items such as oil and agricultural products 
mandela arrived at national airport in midafternoon sunday 
greeted by randall robinson a leader in the us antiapartheid 
movement officials of the district of columbia government and effi 
barry the wife of mayor marion barry 
barry who is on trial on drug and perjury charges did not 
attend 
at a brief airport arrival ceremony mandela had said he was 
greatly encouraged by his rousing reception in the united 
states 
mandelas motorcade passed some of the countrys most famous 
landmarks such as the lincoln memorial before arriving at the 
madison hotel 
at the hotel hundreds of people lined up behind ropes on the 
sidewalk across the street in hopes of catching a glimpse of 
mandela some danced and waved banners as police watched 
mandelasonly other appearances sunday included brief remarks to 
south african exiles and a visit to a cocktail reception for 
african diplomats both events were closed to the media 
in other remarks at the session with journalists mandela 
criticized the united states for aiding noncommunists rebels in 
angola 
the united states and south africa are the main countries that 
support savimbi he said referring to angolan guerrilla leader 
jonas savimbi 
we strongly condemn that he said adding that the nations 
should respect the political sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of angola angolas central government has received 
help from the soviets and the cubans 
when several journalists asked what could be done to help the 
antiapartheid struggle in south africa mandela said the anc with 
20000 exiles and enormous needs for new programs must have money 
take part in the campaign to raise funds for the anc he said 
mandela also stuck to his support for cuban leader fidel castro 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi and plestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat

a task force of the nations governors urged 
president bush on monday to act on a consensus report calling for 
speedy domestic and international action to fight global warming 
the bipartisan group of politicians led by gov james thompson 
rill said bush appeared more receptive than in the past to the 
idea of taking action 
the report issued on behalf of the national governors 
association said action is needed to stabilize emissions of gases 
said to contribute to global warming to develop an international 
agreement to protect the atmosphere and to use extensive 
reforestation programs to reduce the effects of climate change 
the white house position has been that global warming is an 
unproven theory and that further study should precede action 
thompson and the other governors said that although considerable 
scientific uncertainty remains about the socalled greenhouse 
effect and other components of climatic change enough evidence is 
in hand to justify action now 
democratic gov buddy roemer of louisiana said bush must elude 
two traps if he is to deal with the problem successfully 
in the first place if bush were to wait for 100 percent 
scientific certainty you are paralyzed and nothing will be 
done because not all of the facts are on one side of the 
question roemer said 
but i think the president will come to the conclusion that the 
evidence is clear enough to justify action now roemer said 
the other trap he said is the fact that the issue 
transcends the next election and extends well into the next century 
it is important to act now roemer said i think he 
will 
task force recommendations include 
costeffective energy conservation and efficiency measures to 
stabilize us emissions of carbon dioxide 
halting the production of chlorofluorocarbons and using 
costeffective strategies to stabilize or reduce other 
greenhouse gases 
beginning extensive forestry programs to reduce the effect of 
climatic change 
developing and commercializing alternativeenergy systems 
including clean fossil fuel renewable energy sources and safe 
nuclear power 
planing and acting now to adapt to a changing climate 
thompson said the report is important because it is probably 
the first and only consensus document that exists anywhere on the 
issue of global climate change and the greenhouse effect 
its an incredible consensus he said noting that the 
governors who produced the report come from urban and rural areas 
from regions that produce coal and natural gas and from farm states 
we tried to see beyond the excessive rhetoric that sometimes 
surrounds this issue thompson said those of us who must make 
policy in the face of scientific uncertainty must be careful to 
avoid overreaction but given the potential significance of global 
climate change some immediate steps are justified 
because of that uncertainty thompson said the policies we 
recommend have multiple benefits including cleaner air and energy 
security 
regardless of how much or how little our climate changes the 
result of these actions will be a cleaner environment he said 
i think the presidents reaction to the whole report and the 
consensus that has been reached was a very strong one thompson 
said i think we did get from the president a pledge for 
international leadership 
the possibility of global warming and destructive climatic 
change is based on the fact that earths atmosphere acts like a 
greenhouse around the globe certain gases generated on the surface 
rise into the atmosphere trap the suns heat and warm the planet 
although the greenhouse effect warms the planet to the extent 
needed to make it habitable the governors noted the concern in 
recent years that the atmosphere may be being warmed at an 
excessive rate 
the report was presented to bush by thompson roemer and 
governors madeline kunin dvt and terry e branstad riowa

fang lizhi has said he is happiest pondering the 
mysteries of the universe it is this fascination with the unknown 
that led to his break with marxism and emergence as one of chinas 
most outspoken critics 
fangs research in cosmology the study of the universe and 
black hole physics won him international attention but a debate in 
that field several years ago forced the 54yearold astrophysicist 
to question his communist leaders 
former politburo member hu qiaomu had questioned the need to 
study cosmology since marxism already maintained the universe was 
infinite 
this is an open question right now fang replied in 
cosmology marxism is not right 
it was the first step in a process that led to the leaderships 
enmity and to fangs eventual flight to the us embassy to seek 
shelter from prosecution he was allowed to leave the embassy on 
monday after more than a year and he flew to britain 
fang became bestknown for his fearless advocacy of transforming 
the one party communist state into a freer society he was one of 
only a few chinese who dared to campaign publicly for democratic 
change before the popular uprising for freedom rocked beijing in 
the spring of 1989 
i like to speak freely fang said in an interview in 1988 
i think i just show we have the right of speech 
fang not only spoke with students and foreign reporters but also 
tried to reach a broader tougher audience of chinese 
some people think china doesnt need democracy but i think 
human rights are basic fang told actors scientists and business 
leaders at a gathering in february 1989 for human rights to be 
realized first of all famous people must take a stand 
fang the son of a postal clerk in hangzhou was admitted to 
beijing university in 1952 at age 16 to study theoretical physics 
and nuclear physics 
after studying nuclear reactor theory he became one of chinas 
pioneer researchers in laser theory 
he burst into political prominence during prodemocracy student 
demonstrations of 198687 authorities alleged his speeches to 
students at the university of science and technology where he was 
vice president incited unrest 
chinas leaders kicked him out of the communist party and fired 
him from his university post although the demonstrations died 
down fang refused to be silenced and he received letters of 
support from across the country almost daily 
in january 1989 fang called for the release of all political 
prisoners and urged intellectuals to join together to work for 
human rights 
the following month when president bush was visiting beijing 
fang was barred from attending a banquet held by the united states 
china said that inviting him was an insult 
china had accused fang and his wife li shuxian of leading the 
huge prodemocracy protests last spring although the two did not 
take an active role 
after the june 4 1989 military crackdown on the 
demonstrations in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
died fang and li sought refuge in the us embassy american 
diplomats refused to turn them over to chinese authorities 
while being sheltered at the embassy fang and li declined to 
talk with reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all 
questions about them 
in november however fang wrote a letter accepting a human 
rights award 
remember that in the current climate of terror it may well be 
that those who are most terrified are those who have just finished 
the killing he wrote 
we may be forced to live under a terror today but we have no 
fear of tomorrow the murderers are not only fearful today they 
are even more terrified of tomorrow

parliament presidents from east and west 
germany on a historic joint visit to israel pledged monday that a 
united germany would be a strong supporter of the jewish state 
deputy knesset speaker dan tichon hailed the visit as a goodwill 
gesture and said it was an important and unparalleled milestone 
in all connected between israel and the two germanys 
the welcome was not unanimous 
knesset speaker dov shilansky a survivor of the dachau death 
camp who has vowed never to receive german delegations took a 
oneday vacation monday to avoid meeting rita suessmuth of west 
germany and sabine bergmannpohl of east germany 
shilansky was scheduled to receive the two women in his 
jerusalem home tuesday and the maariv daily reported he would tell 
them about his suffering at the hands of the nazis 
the visit is the first joint trip abroad by the leaders of the 
two parliaments and they said it was designed to allay israeli 
concerns about german unification 
we came here to ask for forgiveness but also to win trust 
concerning the process of german unification said ms 
bergmannpohl a physician and political newcomer who became head 
of east germanys first freely elected parliament in april 
there are fears in israel concerning how the united germany 
will act toward israel which role it will play in the world 
added ms suessmuth in a united germany relations with israel 
will get stronger and that germany will not shy away from its 
responsibilities and obligations toward the jewish state she 
said 
at the knesset the two presidents reviewed a 20member honor 
guard as the blackredandgold flags of their countries one with 
a hammer and sickle and one without were raised alongside the 
israeli flag 
each laid a wreath at a statue for fallen israeli soldiers 
outside the knesset entrance on a hilltop overlooking jerusalem 
they briefly attended a routine session of the knesset in which 
only about 20 of the 120members including prime minister yitzhak 
shamir were present the parliament rarely has more members in 
attendance unless an important vote is scheduled 
the polishborn shamir who lost his parents in the holocaust 
got up briefly to announce the naming of deputy ministers in his 
new government but did not acknowledge the presence of the two 
presidents in the visitors gallery 
another deputy knesset speaker shevach weiss said he was very 
moved by the visit 
im a survivor of the holocaust weiss who spent two years 
hiding from the nazis in the basement of a house in the ukraine 
told the visiting german politicians 
you belong to a new generation according to jewish 
tradition guilt should not be transferred from one generation to 
the next but i hope that israel and the free world including the 
two germanys will work together so we wont forget the horrors 
of the holocaust he said 
earlier monday ms bergmannpohl told reporters at ben gurion 
international airport that she would seek speedy establishment of 
relations between her country and israel 
the possibility of ties first arose after last falls toppling 
of the ruling east german communists who were hostile toward 
israel and refused to accept moral responsibility for the 
holocaust the communists argued that they themselves were 
persecuted by the nazis 
in april the east german parliament issued a resolution 
apologizing to jews around the world for the atrocities of the 
holocaust and pledging to pay reparations 
preliminary talks on diplomatic relations have been held between 
east germany and israel this year foreign ministry spokesman motti 
amihai said efforts would continue despite the quickening moves 
toward german unification

a public inquiry into the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 will begin oct 1 officials said monday but 
relatives of the victims were not satisfied 
all 259 people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 people in the town 
of lockerbie were killed when the aircraft exploded and crashed on 
dec 21 1988 
lord fraser scotlands chief law officer said in december he 
would convene a fatal accident inquiry but he did not announce the 
date until monday 
relatives groups have been demanding a broader inquiry 
independent of the government 
dr jim swire who heads a relatives group called uk families 
flight 103 said he doubted the value of a fatal accident inquiry 
we believe there is a coverup of uk security and until 
there is a full independent inquiry we will continue to believe 
so said swire whose daughter flora 24 was killed on the plane 
scottish and us officials have said they do not have enough 
evidence to prosecute anyone for the attack 
the ordering of the fatal accident inquiry does not in any way 
signify an end of the hunt for those responsible for the mass 
murder at lockerbie said fraser we remain as committed today 
as ever to bringing the evil perpetrators to justice he said 
frasers comments indicated he did not expect a criminal inquiry 
by oct 1 
the fatal accident inquiry will be held at crichton royal 
hospital in dumfries about 10 miles west of lockerbie 
scottish police who have coordinated an international 
investigation have said the bomb was hidden inside a 
radiocassette recorder that was probably put aboard the flight in 
frankfurt west germany 
baggage was shifted to the 747 at heathrow airport in london 
and the bomb exploded as the new yorkbound flight was reaching 
cruising altitude 
the fatal accident inquiry will be conducted by sheriff 
principal john mowatt the senior sheriff for southwestern scotland 
the sheriff sets the scope for the inquiry he is charged with 
finding where and when the deaths occurred the cause any 
reasonable precautions that might have avoided it any defects 
in systems or procedures that contributed to the deaths and any 
other facts relevant to the circumstances 
frasers office said a sheriff had the power to compel witnesses 
to attend or documents to be produced but this power is confined 
to the united kingdom sheriffs can issue a letter of request 
to overseas authorities for evidence to be made available 
the government may claim public interest immunity over 
documents exhibits or evidence but that claim may be overturned 
by courts

that testimony supported lewis previous testimony that he and 
barry had used marijuana and cocaine together during the trip

in between the courtesies and the courtliness 
there was blunt talk monday on the south lawn when president bush 
welcomed nelson mandela to the white house they are allies with 
differences and neither man was reluctant to speak his mind 
the american president said apartheidis an evil and mandela is a 
man who embodies the hopes of millions beyond that bush added 
his support for continuing economic sanctions against south africa 
but bush took a jab at mandelas embrace of leftwing causes 
when he said that the mere end of apartheid would be a hollow 
victory indeed if south africa opted for marxism 
just as this past year so many millions of people in eastern 
europe and elsewhere have tasted freedom so too south africas 
time will come the future belongs not to the dwindling ranks 
of the worlds dictators but to democracy bush said 
at another point he stressed that the united states was 
committed to the concept of free market 
bush was a gracious host in the presence of a man who is drawing 
fire from some republican party figures after his expressions of 
admiration for cubas fidel castro libyas moammar gadhafi and the 
palestine liberation organizations yasser arafat 
mandela was at his courtly best as he responded to bushs 
remarks to receive the support of the government of the united 
states of america the leader of the west is something beyond 
words he said but almost in the next breath mandela departed 
from the normal decorum of such occasions by challenging bush on 
the question of violence 
mandela made clear he was not prepared to accept bushs appeal 
for a blanket renunciation of the use of violence 
the remarks he has made here are due to the fact that he has 
not as yet got a proper briefing from us mandela said speaking 
extemporaneously so long as the south african government is 
committed to peace talks use of violence is out of the question 
he said but he then added if we are forced to resort to 
violence it is because we have no other alternative whatsoever 
its not surprising that the two men have differences 
bush has seen democratic capitalism work to advantage mandela 
has seen the horror of a system in which democracy has been limited 
to a privileged minority its easier for bush to talk about the 
virtue of restraint than it is for mandela 
mandela has left some listeners confused about his vision of a 
postapartheid south africa 
during his us visit he has praised effusively the american 
system but he also has been effusive about cubas system and about 
what he regards as the positive role of south africas communist 
party 
on capitol hill where mandela was expected to receive a warm 
welcome tuesday when he becomes the first black private citizen 
ever to address a joint meeting of congress his embrace of arafat 
gadhafi and castro were making some supporters nervous and 
raising the ire of opponents 
rep howard wolpe dmich a mandela supporter and chairman of 
the house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa said in an 
interview that mandelas support for castro gadhafi and arafat 
were not helpful 
i dont think he fully understands how those names resonate 
within the united states wolpe said there are few people who 
are held in lower esteem 
despite the controversy mandela is sure to be accorded a heros 
welcome by much of congress like bush they will have differences 
with the man but respect for his experience and his role in the 
changes in south africa

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 
decision monday saying states may bar the removal of 
lifesustaining treatment from comatose patients who have not made 
or cannot make their desires known 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the majority of states in this country have laws imposing 
criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide 
we do not think a state is required to remain neutral in the 
face of an informed and voluntary decision by a physicallyable 
adult to starve to death 
but in the context presented here a state has more particular 
interests at stake the choice between life and death is a deeply 
personal decision of obvious and overwhelming finality we believe 
missouri may legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of 
this choice through the imposition of heightened evidentiary 
requirements 
it cannot be disputed that the due process clause protects an 
interest in life as well as an interest in refusing lifesustaining 
medical treatment not all incompetent patients will have loved 
ones available to serve as surrogate decisionmakers and even where 
family members are present there will of course be some 
unfortunate situations in which family members will not act to 
protect a patient 
an erroneous decision not to terminate results in a 
maintenance of the status quo the possibility of subsequent 
developments such as advancements in medical science the discovery 
of new evidence regarding the patients intent changes in the law 
or simply the unexpected death of the patient despite the 
administration of lifesustaining treatment at least create the 
potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its 
impact mitigated 
an erroneous decision to withdraw lifesustaining treatment 
however is not susceptible of correction in a previous case one 
of the factors which led the court to require proof by clear and 
convincing evidence in a proceeding to terminate parental rights 
was that a decision in such a case was final and irrevocable 
the same must surely be said of the decision to discontinue 
hydration and nutrition of a patient such as nancy cruzan which 
all agree will result in her death 
no doubt is engendered by anything in this record but that 
nancy cruzans mother and father are loving and caring parents 
close family members may have a strong feeling a feeling not at 
all ignoble or unworthy but not entirely disinterested either 
that they do not wish to witness the continuation of the life of a 
loved one which they regard as hopeless meaningless and even 
degrading 
but there is no automatic assurance that the view of close 
family members will necessarily be the same as the patients would 
have been had she been confronted with the prospect of her 
situation while competent all of the reasons previously discussed 
for allowing missouri to require clear and convincing evidence of 
the patients wishes lead us to conclude that the state may choose 
to defer only to those wishes rather than confide the decision to 
close family members 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
because i believe that nancy cruzan has a fundamental right 
to be free of unwanted artificial nutrition and hydration which 
right is not outweighed by any interests of the state and because 
i find that the improperly biased procedural obstacles imposed by 
the missouri supreme court impermissibly burden that right i 
respectfully dissent 
nancy cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity 
an erroneous decision to terminate lifesupport is irrevocable 
says the majority while an erroneous decision not to terminate 
results in a maintenance of the status quo 
but from the point of view of the patient an erroneous 
decision in either direction is irrevocable an erroneous decision 
to terminate artificial nutrition and hydration to be sure will 
lead to failure of that last remnant of physiological life the 
brain stem and result in complete brain death an erroneous 
decision not to terminate lifesupport however robs a patient of 
the very qualities protected by the right to avoid unwanted medical 
treatment his own degraded existence is perpetuated his familys 
suffering is protracted the memory he leaves behind becomes more 
and more distorted 
the missouri courts disdain for nancys statements in 
serious conversations not long before her accident for the 
opinions of nancys family and friends as to her values beliefs 
and certain choice and even for the opinion of an outside 
objective factfinder appointed by the state evinces a disdain for 
nancy cruzans own right to choose 
the rules by which an incompetent persons wishes are determined 
must represent every effort to determine those wishes the rule 
that the missouri court adopted transforms human beings into 
passive subjects of medical technology 
the majority justifies its position by arguing that while close 
family members may have a strong feeling about the question 
there is no automatic assurance that the view of close family 
members will necessarily be the same as the patients would have 
been had she been confronted with the prospect of her situation 
while competent ibid i cannot quarrel with this observation 
but it leads only to another question is there any reason to 
suppose that a state is more likely to make the choice that the 
patient would have made than someone who knew the patient 
intimately to ask this is to answer it as the new jersey supreme 
court observed family members are best qualified to make 
substituted judgments for incompetent patients not only because of 
their peculiar grasp of the patients approach to life but also 
because of their special bonds with him or her it is they 
who treat the patient as a person rather than a symbol of a 
cause 
the state in contrast is a stranger to the patient

a leading congressional supporter of nelson 
mandela said monday he wished the black leader had not been so 
insistent in his praise for supporters such as cuba libya and the 
palestine liberation organization 
mandela was expected to receive a warm welcome on capitol hill 
when he becomes the first black private citizen ever to address a 
joint meeting of congress on tuesday but his links to 
controversial figures such as yasser arafat moammar gadhafi and 
fidel castro were making some supporters uncomfortable 
in public comments last week mandela voiced strong support for 
gadhafi castro and arafat saying they support our struggle to 
the hilt and that he had no problem with their approach to human 
rights he called arafat a comrade in arms and said he would 
not soften his support on the basis of the interests of the 
jewish community 
our attitude toward any country is determined by the attitude 
of that country toward our struggle he said 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa said monday i wish he mandela 
had not said those things very frankly they were not helpful 
wolpe was one of the key lawmakers behind the 1986 passage of 
legislation imposing sanctions on south africa and has been among 
mandelas strongest supporters in congress 
another supporter of sanctions rep larry smith dfla said 
he would boycott mandelas speech 
he comes here and espouses support not just casual offhand 
support but significant support for people whose methods and 
backgrounds are terrorists outlaws or communist dictators smith 
said people who practice every day what nelson mandela has 
fought his whole life against 
i wished he would not have been so insistent in his reluctance 
to be critical of those individuals wolpe said in an interview 
i dont think he fully understands how those names resonate 
within the united states there are few people who are held in 
lower esteem 
wolpe said he hopes mandela will at some point address the human 
rights concerns that americans have about those the black leader 
counts among his allies 
but he said it would be tragic if the comments were to 
overshadow mandelas visit to capitol hill on tuesday or to 
diminish us resolve to keep up the economic pressure on south 
africa to throw out its racially based government 
wolpe said mandela and south african president fw de klerk 
are the two keys to reform in that country if anything 
happened to either of them this entire process would unravel in an 
instant and the members of congress recognize that he said 
one of the more extreme views of mandelas visit was expressed 
monday by archconservative rep william dannemeyer rcalif who 
called it a national disgrace that the leader of the african 
national congress was scheduled to address the us congress 
dannemeyer cited the ancs links to violence and mandelas 
statements in support of arafat gadhafi and castro 
nelson mandela is no martin luther king he is more like h 
rap brown or willie horton dannemeyer said in a floor statement 
his wife winnie has given a new meaning to the word 
necklace the latter statement was a reference to the practice 
of necklacing torture by placing a gasolinefilled tire around 
the neck of the victim 
mandela will be the fourth black leader to address a joint 
meeting of congress and the first black who is not a head of 
state the others were president william tolbert of liberia in 
1976 president paul magloire of haiti in 1955 and emperor haile 
selassie of ethiopia in 1954 
mandela also is the third private citizen to address such a 
meeting the others were polands solidarity leader lech walesa 
last year and the marquis de lafayette of france in 1824

the senate on monday debated a constitutional 
amendment against flag burning that was killed by the house last 
week but remained alive with political consequence 
flag burning like pornography was beyond the founding 
fathers understanding of freedom said sen jesse helms rnc 
calling on the senate to help send the amendment to the states for 
ratification 
if we tamper with the bill of rights on the 200th anniversary 
of our constitution then we are ultimately diminishing every flag 
in america said sen thomas daschle dsd 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
said the senate was engaged in an attempt to enmesh the flag in 
politics in the november elections rather than in an attempt to 
protect it 
the house voted 254177 in favor of the flag amendment 34 votes 
short of the twothirds majority needed twothirds approval is 
needed in both houses to send a proposed amendment to the states 
for ratification 
speaker thomas foley dwash led the opposition which 
portrayed the amendment as an attack on the bill of rights 
sen strom thurmond rsc senior republican on the judiciary 
committee said opponents to the amendment misinterpreted its 
application to the right of free speech 
behind him the senate chamber was decorated with posters of 
quotations from supreme court justices who disagreeing with the 
current court said protecting the flag was not in violation of 
first amendment rights 
the senate should vote favorably on this proposal and send it 
back to the house so they may atone for their earlier decision 
he said 
foley said last week he planned no more house votes on the 
amendment this year since approval by both chambers is required 
the proposal is dead until the next session of congress 
still senate proponents led by minority leader bob dole 
rkan insisted that their chamber vote on the amendment the vote 
was scheduled for tuesday 
republicans in this falls election hope to take control the 
senate from the democrats and they are using the flag amendment as 
a campaign issue several incumbent democrats oppose the flag 
amendment while their gop challengers support it 
the flag protection amendment is dead but flag politics 
is just beginning biden said 
the proposed amendment backed by president bush reads the 
congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical 
desecration of the flag of the united states 
if approved it would be the 27th amendment to the constitution 
the amendment was first proposed a year ago after the supreme 
court found flag burning to be a form of free speech protected by 
the first amendment 
in reaction to that decision congress passed a new statute 
against flag burning the supreme court on june 11 ruled 54 that 
the new law also violated the constitution rekindling the 
political debate 
biden who led the fight last year for a statute said he could 
support a constitutional amendment but not the one before the 
senate the wording of the proposal clearly aimed it against speech 
offensive to the government which was the core principle of 
free speech 
instead biden said he favored an amendment that would protect 
the physical integrity of the flag without entering the realm of 
judging the purpose of the flag burning or other attack 
congress should protect the flag but i for one do not want to 
burn the constitution in the process he said 
others also planned to offer alternative amendments or statutes 
but the senate appeared in no mood to tinker with the issue and 
tuesdays vote was expected to be yes or no on the republican 
proposal 
its a dead issue in a congress that should be spending time 
on other things biden said

imelda marcos knew dirty money was used for 
investments that the former philippine first lady and her husband 
made in the united states a prosecutor told a jury in closing 
arguments monday 
she wasnt just an outside observer who had things happening 
around her that she didnt know about assistant us attorney 
charles labella said 
imelda marcos was not in a glass tomb she was not afraid to 
venture into the business world labella said she was in the 
thick of things 
mrs marcos 60 has been on trial since march 20 on charges of 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction 
of justice 
the defense presented no witnesses because marcos attorney 
gerry spence said there was no case 
spence has said mrs marcos was unaware of any wheeling and 
dealing by her late husband former philippines president 
ferdinance marcos and her codefendant saudi financier adnan 
khashoggi 
defense attorneys are to give their closing arguments tuesday 
and wednesday and the case is expected to go to the us district 
court jury on thursday 
monday the prosecutor outlined what he called the 
circumstantial evidence that proves mrs marcos and khashoggi 
violated us laws 
now you have the opportunity to put all the pieces together 
labella said you can be sure that imelda marcos and adnan 
khashoggi actually participated in the acts which are crimes in 
the united states 
the government alleges that the marcoses looted their countrys 
treasury of 222 million during their 20 years in power investing 
some of the money in four new york office buildings jewelry and 
artworks 
khashoggi 54 is accused of faking documents to help conceal 
the marcoses ownership of the real estate and paintings that 
allegedly occurred after a us court order froze their assets 
after their ouster from power in february 1986 
they needed someone to take this hot potato off their hands 
adnan khashoggi was the credible front they came up with labella 
said 
witnesses at the trial described bribes and kickbacks from 
projects funded by a japanese war reparation fund commissions 
that were to go to the governmentowned national oil company and 
fraudulent deals to exchange philippine pesos to us dollars 
through the countrys central bank 
labella traced these funds to the purchase of three office 
buildings and a retail building the herald center in manhattan 
as an example he said the war reparation kickbacks were part of 
the dirty money used to purchase the herald center 
labella said mrs marcos in her roles as mayor of metro manila 
and minister of human settlements had to be aware of the 
transactions 
imelda marcos was not just the wife of ferdinand marcos he 
said she was a highranking government official of course she 
knew that they had to get the money from somewhere 
the prosecutor also said mrs marcos could be convicted if the 
jury decided she consciously avoided finding out the source of 
their wealth 
the prosecutor dismissed as fiction a defense argument that 
the marcoses invested in new york real estate in order to hide 
funds to fight back against a communist takeover of their country 
spence said outside of court that he was more optimistic than he 
had been earlier about his clients chances for acquittal 
its always scary at this stage of the trial but it looks 
better than i expected because they havent proved a case of 
direct involvement against her he said 
if convicted mrs marcos would face a maximum of 50 years in 
prison and a 1 million fine khashoggi faces a sentence of 10 
years in prison and 500000 in fines if convicted of mail fraud 
and obstruction of justice

israeli police and the shin bet security 
service routinely use violence while interrogating palestinian 
minors an israeli human rights group said in a report released 
monday 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories known as betselem also cited other abuses such as 
overcrowded cells a lack of proper medical attention and delays in 
investigating complaints of police brutality 
police said in response that they were investigating every 
complaint of brutality a spokeswoman also acknowledged that prison 
conditions need to be improved 
police treat complaints of brutality by officers with special 
seriousness an investigation has been launched into every 
complaint submitted to police said elinoar mazoz who deals with 
public complaints 
her statement was attached to the betselem report national 
police spokesman adi gonen said monday he had nothing to add 
the report focused on the treatment of palestinians aged 12 to 
18 from israeliannexed arab east jerusalem and nearby villages 
who were held at police headquarters in downtown jerusalem 
all were detained during the 30month palestinian uprising on 
suspicion of stonethrowing torching cars and antiisraeli 
violence 
betselem said its report was not based on a representative 
survey but that the findings indicated a widespread phenomenon 
that should be viewed seriously 
the report includes affidavits from nine minors they were not 
identified by name in keeping with israeli law 
a 12yearold said he was placed inside a bag by interrogators 
they put the lights out and i felt it being closed above my head 
then they began to beat me with a stick he said 
a 16yearold said an interrogator beat me with the end of a 
plastic ruler on the arms the back and all parts of the body 
then he grabbed a metal bar and hit me on the head i was 
handcuffed all the time 
another 16yearold said he was pushed against a hotwater tank 
and suffered burns when water spilled on his right leg 
betselem said that in most cases the minors did not file 
complaints because they do not believe in israeli justice or fear 
the consequences 
it also said police were not quick enough in investigating and 
punishing officers engaged in brutality 
ms mazoz said police investigated all complaints of brutality 
she cited eight cases in which an investigation has either not been 
completed yet or there was no response from the prosecutors 
the report also described the interrogation methods of the shin 
bet which deals with those over the age of 16 
betselem said the shin bet used a punishment cell measuring

suffocating room where prisoners are often kept for days 
shin bet interrogators also handcuff prisoners in distorted 
poses or place them in the socalled grave a small underground 
cell in which prisoners can only crouch it said 
the shin bet has no spokesman

compound is badly overcrowded in march the compound housed 81 
palestinian youths in three cells including one with 12 beds and 
39 prisoners in it it said 
it quoted the detention centers doctor andre weissman as 
saying he could not offer proper medical treatment to such a large 
number of prisoners 
ms mazoz acknowledged that the youth ward designed for 34 
beds usually held some 60 to 80 inmates because of an increase 
in the number of prisoners as compared with previous years 
she said the prisoners were given medical treatment and cleaned 
their cells three times a day 
betselem also said that detainees were often forced to sign 
confessions in hebrew a language most of them cannot read

the righttodie ruling by the us supreme 
court removes some clinical choices from doctors and family and 
puts the burden of assuring death with dignity solely on one 
person the person who is dying 
though the ruling applies directly only to missouri which 
already has restrictive laws experts believe medical communities 
in many states may generally apply the principles expressed in the 
case decided monday 
the result some said is that if there is any question about 
what a person in a vegetative state would want done the doctors 
may choose to keep the patient alive no matter what the family says 
there are an estimated 10000 americans who are beyond recall 
from coma more are added annually with accidents and illnesses 
and with the increasing skill of medicine to maintain life 
many people in such a state are allowed to die when doctors say 
there is no hope of recovery and the families believe the patient 
would choose such a death 
i think the whole atmosphere in medicine will shift toward a 
more conservative ethical position on providing life support 
said william t reich a professor for bioethics at georgetown 
university hospital this will put a lot of pressure on people to 
sign a living a will or to put something in writing to make 
certain their wishes are known 
dr terry walman a member of the medical ethics committee at 
johns hopkins hospital in baltimore said the ruling suggested that 
those who want to make decisions about their terminal care can no 
longer informally leave it to others 
they must take some action either in writing or appointing 
someone to act in their behalf he said if they dont do that 
then in states with laws like missouri they are in danger of not 
having their wishes followed 
dr david p thomasma the director of the medical humanities 
program at loyola university in chicago said that in a usual 
hospital setting doctors and families talk about what should be 
done about a patient in an irreversible state of coma 
we trust family members and guardians unless there is reason 
to believe they are not trustworthy thomasma said 
often the family members call on memories of what the patient 
said and thought before the accident or injury and try to 
interpret from these recollections what the patient would want 
traditionally the common law in most states permitted 
guardians to make such decisions thomasma said 
for patients whose breathing depends on hightech support he 
said it is universally understood and accepted that the plug can 
be pulled if there is no sign of life in the brain 
but as in the missouri case decided monday the withholding of 
food and nutrition is seen as another issue 
nancy cruzan now 32 suffered severe brain damage in a 1983 car 
accident her parents authorized the use of a feeding tube in the 
hope her condition would improve but later requested that the tube 
be removed ms cruzan who breathes on her own has been in a 
comalike condition for seven years 
the fluid and nutrition issue is the most difficult for people 
because a person is not dying of the underlying disease or injury 
but death is the result of dehydration or starvation thomasma 
said 
the ruling left intact the concept that comatose patients can be 
deprived of food and water unto death but it now permits states to 
pass laws that would require a higher level of proof of the 
patients wishes 
this is the first time that the court has said that such clear 
proof is needed said walman an anesthesiologist and lawyer 
it makes it much harder now for the family to speak for the 
patients 
a head injury stroke or drug reaction could send anyone forever 
into unconsciousness but few people actually take formal action 
ahead of time to make sure their medical wishes are followed 
dr joanne lynn director of aging studies at george washington 
university said that even if people do write out their wishes 
ahead of time it would be unlikely that they could describe 
precisely the medical circumstance of their final illness 
without a precise description she said under the new ruling 
patients in states with laws such as missouri would have to be kept 
alive 
under the missouri ruling a person who is suffering horribly 
but who is incompetent must be kept alive by the healthcare 
giver if possible lynn said

marlon brandos daughter cheyenne has left 
the country and will refuse to return and testify against her 
brother christian a prosecutor said monday 
deputy district attorney steven barshop told a judge he will 
attempt to use a recently enacted law to introduce miss brandos 
statements to police as evidence in a preliminary hearing for the 
brother who is charged with murdering miss brandos boyfriend 
municipal court judge rosemary shumsky set brandos preliminary 
hearing for july 23 but did not rule on the issue surrounding the 
new law the matter was being transferred to another judge 
brandos lawyer robert shapiro said outside court he was not 
sure he would challenge barshops plan suggesting that the use of 
proposition 115 rules would be beneficial to christian 
under the initiative approved by voters in the june 5 election 
prosecutors may present hearsay evidence at the hearing in which a 
judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence to hold a 
defendant for trial 
the measure is intended to spare victims the ordeal of 
testifying at the preliminary hearing and then having to repeat 
their stories at trial 
barshop said he would attempt to introduce miss brandos 
statement to police in a june 12 interview as evidence against her 
brother 
he said that miss brando who is eight months pregnant with the 
child of her dead boyfriend has gone to tahiti and refuses to 
return 
marlon brando maintains a home there 
miss brandos boyfriend dag drollet 26 was shot to death on 
may 16 at the elder brandos estate 
the actor was home at the time but was in a different part of 
the house and did not see the slaying 
christian brando 32 reportedly told police that drollet had 
died during a struggle over a gun 
accounts of the slaying have been confused and the preliminary 
hearing is expected to present the first clear picture of what 
happened

defense secretary dick cheney said monday that 
major investments in new military bases and strategic home ports 
would not preclude a later decision to close the facilities in 
times of reduced defense spending 
obviously were not oblivious to whats been spent cheney 
said at a luncheon with reporters the fact that those are new 
facilities that we spent money on does not automatically guarantee 
that theyre going to stay open 
cheney is expected to ask congress this week to cancel a 
significant number of military construction projects at home and 
abroad in response to expected reductions in the defense budget 
the pentagon estimates the value of the 207 projects under 
consideration at 12 billion 
the candidates for cancellation include the controversial home 
ports in new york texas alabama and mississippi 
funds for the projects have been approved already forcing 
cheney to ask congress to withdraw the money through a process 
formally known as rescission 
cheney said monday that each facility will be decided on a 
casebycase basis but in response to a question as to whether new 
installations would be affected the defense secretary said we 
have no choice 
cheney said the navy of the future is likely to be closer to 450 
ships than the 600ship force that was envisioned during the 
defense buildup of the 1980s

federal and state animalhealth authorities 
are cooperating in a nationwide alert for signs of mad cow 
disease which has stricken britains cattle industry the 
agriculture department said monday 
the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse was not 
known to exist in the united states said james w glosser 
administrator of the departments animal health and inspection 
service 
the disease attacks the central nervous system and is fatal to 
cattle there has been no scientific evidence that it is a human 
health hazard officials said 
the agency glosser said has barred the importation of live 
cattle from britain since july 1989 
also over 150 federal and state veterinarians constantly 
conduct field investigations of suspicious diseases and report 
their findings to us glosser said 
the national surveillance program will include usda animal 
health officials state veterinary diagnostic laboratories and iowa 
state university 
initially he said laboratories in at least 16 states will be 
cooperating in the program california iowa illinois indiana 
kentucky maryland michigan minnesota missouri new york ohio 
pennsylvania tennessee virginia washington and wisconsin 
glosser said other states also have requested to be included so 
laboratory specimens may be received from other sources as well 
cattle affected by bse may suffer changes in temperament such 
as nervousness or aggression thus accounting for it sometimes 
being called mad cow disease 
other symptoms include abnormal posture lack of coordination 
and difficulty in rising reduced milk production loss of body 
weight despite continued appetite and eventually death 
confirmation of the disease is possible only through postmortem 
examination of the animals brain there is no test to detect the 
disease in a live animal

family members can be barred from ending the 
lives of persistently comatose relatives who have not made their 
wishes known conclusively the supreme court ruled monday in its 
first righttodie decision 
by a 54 vote the justices gave states broad power to keep such 
patients on lifesupport systems specifically the court blocked 
the parents of a missouri woman nancy cruzan from ordering 
removal of tubes that provide her with food and water 
the court clearing the way to end its term on wednesday 
decided another fundamental and emotional privacy issue by making 
it significantly more difficult for young girls to obtain legal 
abortions without first notifying their parents 
the court voted 63 to uphold an ohio law that bans abortions 
for unmarried girls under 18 who are dependent on one or both 
parents unless one parent is notified 
and the court voted 54 to allow minnesota to require 
notification of both parents as long as girls can avoid telling 
them by getting a judges permission instead 
mondays righttodie ruling encouraged supporters of living 
will laws because the court said the constitution guarantees a 
competent person as opposed to someone in a coma a right to 
refuse medical treatment 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
we assume that the united states constitution would grant a 
competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse 
lifesaving hydration and nutrition 
but in ms cruzans case he said such clear and convincing 
proof that she would want to die is lacking and it is too risky to 
leave the decision to anyone else even loving parents 
not all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to 
serve as surrogate decisionmakers rehnquist said a state is 
entitled to guard against potential abuses where a guardian 
seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed 
to be in a persistent vegetative state 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin j scalia and anthony m kennedy 
doctors have said ms cruzan 32 could live for 30 more years 
in her current persistent vegetative condition 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said 
missouri officials and the high court are violating ms cruzans 
rights 
nancy cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity he 
said those denying her that right have discarded evidence of her 
will ignored her values and deprived her of the right to a 
decision as closely approximating her own choice as humanly 
possible 
ms cruzans parents presented evidence she had told friends she 
would never want to remain alive in a vegetative state lower 
courts said that was not sufficient proof of her intentions 
in a separate dissent justice john paul stevens said the 
states unflagging determination to perpetuate nancy cruzans 
physical existence is comprehensible only as an effort to define 
lifes meaning not as an attempt to preserve its sanctity 
justice thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun also dissented 
ms cruzans father joe cruzan sheet metal worker had little 
to say when he arrived at his twostory frame carterville mo 
home with a lunch bucket and can of soda at noon 
we really dont know what the decision means yet so it would 
be pointless to comment he said before closing the door 
dick kurtenbach of the american civil liberties union that has 
represented the family said the ruling is unfortunate but not 
surprising 
im sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed 
he said 
dr nancy dickey of the american medical association said the 
ruling is an intrusion into the doctorpatient relationship and a 
step toward taking that decision away from the bedside we 
should not deliver unnecessary care and pay for unnecessary care 
groups opposed to mercy killing hailed the decision 
the high court has affirmed that persons who are unable to 
speak for themselves can be protected from the death sentence that 
euthanasia activists seek to force on them said rita marker of 
the international antieuthanasia task force 
despite the publicity the cruzan case has attracted the 
rulings impact may be limited courts in nearly every state except 
missouri have permitted removal of lifesustaining treatment for 
the permanently unconscious 
and the decision does not bar state courts or state 
legislatures from continuing to allow the removal of such 
treatment even for incompetent persons 
most states including missouri have livingwill laws that 
allow people to authorize the termination of lifesustaining 
treatment before they undergo medical treatment but the laws vary 
in their specifics missouris version for example does not allow 
removal of feeding tubes in any case it was not in effect when 
ms cruzan was injured in a 1983 car crash 
it is estimated that as many as 10000 americans are receiving 
lifesustaining care 
after ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage her parents 
authorized the use of a feeding tube in hopes her condition would 
improve 
but for seven years she has remained in a comalike condition 
her body rigid her hands and feet constricted she can breathe on 
her own and at times her eyes are open and move randomly 
the bush administration sided with missouri officials in urging 
she be kept alive permitting the removal of a feeding tube is a 
step toward sanctioning mercy killing or suicide justice 
department lawyers said 
the righttodie issue captured national attention in 1976 when 
the new jersey supreme court allowed the family of karen ann 
quinlan to order the removal of a respirator helping her breathe 
ms quinlan in a similar comalike condition to that of ms 
cruzan continued to be fed through a tube and lived nine more 
years

a black alderman battling a sausage maker over 
renaming a street for the rev martin luther king jr faces a 
possible censure for issuing a warning that the companys products 
were tainted by rat poison 
alderman michael mcgees warning forced usingers famous sausage 
inc a centuryold familyowned business in milwaukee to recall 
80000 pounds of meat from 150 stores since then the company has 
conducted a preliminary inspection and said it found none of the 
meats to be tainted 
mayor john o norquist and some city council members are 
threatening to punish mcgee for what they say is an unsubstantiated 
threat 
at a weekend news conference norquist called mcgee 
demented and accused him of fabricating the warning to gain 
attention the mayor said mcgees antics were feeding racism and 
bigotry in the city 
mcgee one of three blacks on the 16member council recently 
started a black panther militia group he said it would stage 
violent terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if innercity 
conditions in milwaukee dont improve 
mcgee has claimed his militia already has about 500 members 
including many young street gang members he has said that possible 
targets of violence could be motorists driving along highways or 
fans at sports events 
the sausage warning prompted common council president thomas 
donegan to say that mcgee had pushed freedom of speech beyond its 
limit donegan said he was planning to strip the alderman of his 
committee assignments 
he also said the council would vote friday on a censure against 
mcgee i dont want to look like a racist attacking my colleague 
but i think if were provoking fear and anxiety we have to do 
something donegan said monday 
the sausage was recalled after mcgee said he received an 
anonymous phone call that usingers products had been injected with 
rat poison by the militant african underground squared he 
identified it as an underground group 
the group has no telephone listing and has made no statement 
regarding the alleged tampering 
norquist and others said they believe mcgees story was 
fabricated because the alderman brought the warning to news media 
instead of reporting it immediately to police 
its a hoax its phony the mayor charged saturday what 
hes really doing is scaring the hell out of people which feeds 
racism and bigotry 
people in the city for the most part know mcgee is a fool 
they know what he says is not any more than an attempt to feed his 
own ego 
mcgee has refused interviews with the whiteowned news media 
in recent months accusing newspapers of distorting his intentions 
he did not return a reporters phone call to his office monday 
seeking comment 
a group of black politicians called on norquist and others 
monday to apologize to mcgee 
the group which included three state lawmakers and two 
milwaukee county board members said mcgee did nothing wrong and 
was the target of criticism because he was an africanamerican 
male 
without an apology to mcgee i dont think its fair to say 
well have much peace in this city milwaukee county supervisor 
terrance pitts told reporters 
mcgee flanked by two uniformed members of his militia attended 
the news conference and spoke only briefly 
im going to take the pledge of allegiance to milwaukee im a 
real milwaukeean he said curtly declining other comment 
police said they had received no reports of food tampering and 
criminal charges were unlikely usingers however is proceeding 
to inspect all the meat it recalled before releasing it for sale 
said spokesman evan n zeppos 
we have no alternative but to take it as a serious situation 
whether it is a hoax or not zeppos said monday zeppos said the 
company has not determined how much the recall has cost it 
usingers and other businesses along north 3rd street have 
opposed an effort to rename the street in honor of king 
part of the street is already named for the slain civil rights 
leader but mcgee and others are lobbying for the entire street to 
be renamed merchants have complained that a name change would 
inconvenience them

a fuel valve from the unfinished 
space shuttle endeavour will be removed and connected to columbia 
grounded until late summer because of a hydrogen leak nasa said 
monday 
shuttle director robert crippen approved the transfer after 
engineers at rockwell international corp in downey calif failed 
to find a leak in hydrogen lines that had been removed from 
columbias external tank 
that confirmed nasas suspicion the problem was with plumbing on 
the orbiter side 
columbias 17inchdiameter disconnect valve in a pipe that 
carries liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the main engines 
will be removed and replaced with the one from endeavour endeavour 
is under construction by rockwell and is not scheduled to fly until 
1992 
only one valve was built for each shuttle there are no spares 
columbias bad valve will be shipped to california for testing 
replacing the valve on the orbiter side is going to take the 
most time said lisa malone spokeswoman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration nonetheless the astronomy 
mission remains targeted for midaugust she said 
columbias scheduled may 30 launch with the 150 million astro 
observatory was scrubbed six hours before liftoff when the leak was 
detected during fueling 
nasa plans to conduct a tanking test on atlantis at the launch 
pad on thursday partly filling the shuttles external tank with 
supercold liquid hydrogen to make sure there are no leaks the 
same test was conducted with columbia a week after the scrubbed 
launch and replicated the leak 
prelaunch tests for leaks normally are conducted with a gaseous 
helium at room temperature rather than volatile liquid hydrogen 
chilled to minus 420 degrees 
atlantis is scheduled for a secret military mission in midjuly 
the date will be set friday following a twoday flight readiness 
review 
we have no reason to believe we have a generic problem 
malone said all leak tests with helium have passed but that 
was the same for columbia

an explosion tonight ripped through the 
conservative partys social club in central london trapping and 
injuring an unknown number of people 
the fire brigade said 40 firefighters were rushed to the blaze 
that broke out following the 830 pm 330 pm edt explosion on 
the ground floor of the threestory carlton club 
the carlton which is among the famous old institutions known 
collectively as londons clubland is an exclusively male club but 
it had to waive that rule in 1979 to admit margaret thatcher when 
she became prime minister 
the 158yearold club near trafalgar square and a few hundred 
yards from buckingham palace is frequented by cabinet ministers 
lawmakers and other members of mrs thatchers conservative party 
she was in dublin for a european community summit 
deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe was at a meeting in a 
nearby building and immediately came to the scene 
some people have been hurt though i cant say how many or 
how seriously howe told reporters 
it was not immediately known whether a bomb was involved but 
sky television news said it had reports a second device was 
found nearby the tv report did not elaborate 
police said they were searching for a car with irish license 
plates 
the irish republican army has been waging a bombing and shooting 
campaign against british soldiers in britain and continental europe 
this summer 
in 1984 the ira came close to blowing up mrs thatcher in the 
seaside town of brighton a bomb exploded in the hotel where she 
was staying for her ruling conservative partys convention five 
people died mrs thatcher was unhurt 
the blast smashed windows and sent up clouds of smoke 
ambulances raced to the scene and police cordoned off the area 
i heard an enormous explosion said ian greener night 
manager at neighboring brookss club we dashed outside and all 
the smoke was coming from the building onto the street so it 
obviously was not a car bomb 
we are still searching the rubble we are also looking for 
suspect secondary devices said a policeman on the scene 
last year the cabinet entertained mrs thatcher to a private 
dinner party at the carlton club to mark her 10 years as prime 
minister

president bush on monday invited congressional 
leaders to the white house to discuss flagging budget negotiations 
as republicans accused democrats of being confused about whether 
the talks should continue 
the leaders were to meet with bush on tuesday a day after a 
budget bargaining session between white house and congressional 
representatives was canceled no further meetings were scheduled 
the cancellation came four days after the last negotiating 
session which ended with democrats rejecting a bush administration 
51 billion deficitreduction proposal for next year as inadequate 
it seems to me the democrats have not yet decided they even 
want to proceed said sen pete domenici rnm after gop 
negotiators met with bush for 90 minutes at the white house 
after thursdays budget session some democrats called the white 
house offer a first step in bargaining while others insisted the 
talks should not continue without a better offer 
we are very perplexed said domenici we dont understand 
what the democrats expect and we dont understand why we are not 
proceeding with negotiations we are ready 
the talks are aimed at finding a way to reduce the deficit for 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 unless action is taken the 
shortfall could exceed 200 billion 
the grammrudman law will trigger widespread spending cuts 
unless the budget gap is no more than 74 billion next year

and bowles he said diversity in state laws trying to regulate 
labeling makes business extraordinarily difficult for nationally 
distributed products 
but its wrong to apply the same guidelines to labeling and 
advertising rosow said 
you cant get it all in a 30second commercial he said 
besides an advertisement simply introduces the consumer to the 
product the label supplies added information when an actual 
purchase is being considered said rosow 
rosow and other executives testifying to the senate governmental 
affairs committee acknowledged the power of advertising but they 
also said the medium is not designed to tell everything about the 
product 
a whole truth is not the same as the whole truth said 
richard manoff of manoff international inc in reference to 
nutritional claims by a popular powdered fruit drink that is high 
in vitamin c though loaded with sugar and of little other 
nutritional value 
sen joseph lieberman dconn who chaired the hearing said 
the food and drug administration federal trade commission and the 
agriculture department should coordinate their rules on health 
claims the advertising executives agreed 
the usda has begun to allow health claims but its criteria 
differ somewhat from those in fdas proposal lieberman said 
and the ftc has allowed health claims in advertising but it has 
advocated a more flexible standard for evaluating such claims than 
that proposed by the fda 
lieberman pointed out that at usda reduced fat means 25 percent 
less fat while at fda it means 50 percent less 
legislation is ready for floor votes in both the house and 
senate that would set federal standards on labeling preempting 
state laws and regulating terms such as light low or 
lean

the family of nancy cruzan who has lain 
in a comalike condition for seven years said monday they will not 
waver in their desire to let her die with dignity 
joe and joyce cruzan released a statement at a news conference 
in kansas city following a us supreme court ruling that barred 
them from removing a lifesustaining feeding tube 
the cruzans did not say anything about the ruling but restated 
their feelings about their 32yearold daughter who was injured in 
a 1983 auto accident and has neither spoken nor acknowledged their 
voices since 
the decision to stop treatment and allow a loved one to die is 
one of the most difficult decisions a family can face the 
cruzans statement said however because of our lifelong shared 
love with nancy and our understanding of her values we concluded 
that we had no choice but to try to set her free from this hopeless 
condition she is trapped in not to do so would be to disregard the 
very meaning of nancys lived life 
since our initial request in may 1987 to the state hospital to 
discontinue treatment and allow nancy the dignity of death our 
goal has never wavered nor does it now 
the cruzans who live in carterville did not attend the news 
conference they have shunned the spotlight and have talked little 
to reporters recently 
we really dont know what the decision means yet so it would 
be pointless to comment joe cruzan a sheet metal worker told a 
reporter when he arrived at his home for lunch monday he had no 
other comment before going into his twostory white frame house 
dick moyer a nextdoor neighbor in the ozarks community of 
about 2000 was more outspoken i think the supreme courts 
decision would be different if each of those justices walked a mile 
in joe and joyces shoes he said 
the supreme court goofed the us justice system is so far 
behind societys thinking its pitiful moyer said 
in its first ruling in a righttodie case the court in a 54 
decision said that states may bar the removal of lifesustaining 
treatment from patients in irreversible comalike conditions 
the justices blocked the parents from ordering the removal of a 
surgically implanted feeding tube that provides nancy cruzan with 
food and water and keeps her alive at the missouri rehabilitation 
center in mount vernon about 30 miles from carterville and 160 
miles south of kansas city in southwest missouri the cost of care 
about 100000 a year is shared by medicaid and the state 
doctors have said ms cruzan could live for 30 more years in her 
current persistent vegetative condition they have said she has 
no hope of recovery 
for joe cruzan theres no doubt about what his daughter would 
want 
she would say pull the plug stop it i dont want to live 
like this i have no dignity i think that probably would be the 
key word no dignity he said in an interview last year 
shortly after the accident her parents authorized the use of a 
feeding tube in hopes her condition would improve but hope never 
became reality 
she has remained in bed her body rigid her hands and feet 
constricted and bent into claw shapes she can breathe on her own 
and at times her eyes are open and move randomly doctors say she 
is incapable of reacting or relating to her environment and can 
experience no thoughts or emotions

realize that sovereignty he said russia largest of the soviet 
republics with half its people and threequarters its land mass

assembling a white mob that attacked and killed a black teenager 
in the bensonhurst section 
john ventos defense lawyer countered in his closing argument 
that his client was neither a killer nor a racist the attorney 
said the triggerman acted independently and unexpectedly when he 
shot yusuf hawkins through the heart

when he appeared before a grand jury acknowledged his role as an 
organizer of the mob 
john vento was one of the ringleaders one of the generals of 
this operation hershey said in this case we know what was in 
john ventos mind because he told us 
hawkins 16 and three friends were accosted when they went to 
the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used car for sale

the national endowment for the arts opposes 
federal support for obscenity as the antithesis of art but its 
judges panels base their grantmaking decisions primarily on 
esthetic and artistic quality the government arts agencys chief 
lawyer said monday 
the lawyer julie davis said the arts endowment expects to 
issue guidelines by july 13 that will interpret controversial 
legislation that forbids endowment support for obscene art to 
help artists receiving federal grants comply with the law 
ms davis said the guidelines generally would embrace the 
supreme courts longstanding obscenity test that test outlined in 
a 1973 decision says material is obscene if it depicts sexual 
conduct in a patently offensive manner appeals to prurient 
interest and lacks serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
ms davis testified at a daylong hearing of an independent 
12member commission created by congress last fall to review the 
endowments grantmaking procedures and consider whether a 
different standard should apply to governmentsubsidized art than 
to privately financed art 
the commission which will meet again in late july hopes to 
report to congress before the group legally expires on sept 30 
the panel was appointed by president bush and the house and 
senate leadership and is headed by former white house counsel 
leonard garment and john brademas a former democratic congressman 
from indiana who is president of new york university 
congress established the commission at the same time it 
prohibited the arts endowment from spending federal funds on any 
artistic works that may be considered obscene including 
depictions of sex acts homoeroticism sadomasochism or sexual 
exploitation of children and which lack any serious literary 
artistic political or scientific value 
the ban was imposed as a result of criticism by conservative 
lawmakers led by sen jesse helms rnc of an 
endowmentsupported exhibits of sexually explicit photographs by 
the late robert mapplethorpe and works by artist andres serrano 
that included an image of a crucifix submerged in urine 
the furor over obscene art has thrust the arts endowment an 
independent federal agency with a 171 million budget into the 
biggest crisis of its 25year history the house and senate are 
bracing for major floor battles over legislation intended to extend 
the neas life and what restrictions might be imposed on artists 
receiving endowment grants 
ms davis said endowment chairman john e frohnmayer believes 
that obscenity is the antithesis of art and has vowed to block 
nea financial support from arts projects that might be deemed 
obscene 
she said the nea panels of outside experts who take preliminary 
action on grant applications base their decisions primarily on 
questions of artistic merit and not on the content of art works 
judgments of whether a grant project might violate the 
antiobscenity law are left to frohnmayer and his senior advisers 
she said 
about 100 recipients of arts endowment grants this year have 
signed the neas antiobscenity pledge under protest endowment 
officials say six artists or arts institutions have rejected nea 
grants rather than sign the pledge 
the endowment has awarded 2000 grants so far this year

prosecutors and defense lawyers argued in 
federal court monday over whether genetic fingerprints should 
be used in a weapons trial of three hells angels accused in the 
slaying of a record store clerk 
lawyers for steven yee mark verdi and john ray bonds told us 
magistrate james carr that the fbis dna testing program is 
unreliable and should not be used as scientific evidence 
carr will rule on whether dna tests should be admissible in the 
case it is the first time the admissibility of dna evidence has 
been argued in the federal court system and carrs ruling could 
establish an important precedent 
the hearing which began monday is expected to last more than a 
month 
the three motorcycle gang members face murder and federal 
weapons charges in the death of david hartlaub a sandusky record 
store clerk who was shot on feb 27 1988 they are being tried on 
the weapons offenses before the murder charges 
assistant us attorney michael rae head of an organized crime 
task force argued that the fbis program is an accurate way of 
analyzing whether a person was involved in a crime 
rae said genetic scientists and biologists would testify that 
the fbis program and dna testing in general is reliable 
genetic fingerprinting involves examining live human tissue such 
as skin and hair or body fluid such as blood or saliva to 
determine a persons genetic code the pattern is found in dna 
deoxyribonucleic acid which forms the basic material in the 
chromosome of the cell nucleus 
some scientists say the odds are as high as 30 billion to 1 that 
any two people outside of identical twins will have the same dna 
pattern 
dwight adams who works in the fbis dna analysis unit told 
carr that dna has been used successfully to determine whether a 
person has been involved in a crime but he acknowledged that 
unlike fingerprints they cannot indicate with 100 percent 
certainty that samples taken from a crime scene came from a suspect 
all i can do is conclude that an individual is a possible 
contributor to that stain but i cannot say he is the sole 
contributor said adams who has a doctorate in biology 
prosecutors said dna tests conducted by the fbi show that bonds 
blood was found in hartlaubs van and in yees car they also said 
bonds was wounded by shrapnel during the shooting 
peter neufeld one of the defendants lawyers said scientists 
are divided over whether absolute matches can be made in criminal 
cases in which the dna is extracted from small amounts of tissue 
neufeld and his partner barry scheck also argued that genetic 
matching often includes subjective judgments on the part of a 
technician 
prosecutors said hartlaub was shot as part of a hells angels 
initiation for bonds they said bonds mistakenly thought hartlaub 
was a member of the outlaws a rival motorcycle gang

the teenagers accused in the central park 
jogger case gangraped and beat their victim and left her to 
die in a puddle of blood and mud a prosecutor said monday 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer described the 
horrors the investment banker endured during the april 19 1989 
attack by a pack of youths during a night of wilding she 
predicted the three defendants who went on trial monday would 
convict themselves with statements they made to police 
they left her to die naked and stripped lederer told the 
jurors in opening statements in triallevel state supreme court 
every bone supporting her left eye was broken she was in 
shock she had cuts and bruises covering her body lederer said 
adding that the victim had lost threequarters of her blood 
when police found her lederer said the victim was moving and 
groping and bleeding heavily she was naked except for a bra 
pushed up near her neck 
there was a bloodsoaked tshirt around her mouth obstructing 
her breathing the prosecutor told jurors 
her pulse had dropped to 40 she was cold to the touch 
lederer said 
the woman making her nightly jog through the northern section 
of the park when attacked miraculously survived but suffered brain 
damage and has no recollection of what happened to her that 
night lederer said 
attorneys for the defendants antron mccray 15 and raymond 
santana and yusef salaam both 16 were to present their opening 
statements later monday they are being tried as adults but will be 
sentenced as juveniles 
the defendants are charged with attempted murder rape sexual 
abuse assault robbery and riot if convicted they could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison 
three other youths will also stand trial 
lederer said the defendants were part of a larger group of 30 to 
35 youths who entered central park the night of the attack 
specifically to rob beat and assault people the three were 
also charged with assaulting two male joggers the same night 
police said the defendants called their action wilding 
the prosecutor told jurors that each of the defendants told 
police they participated in the attack and said photographs show 
that the victims suffered the very injuries the defendants 
described having inflicted 
the prosecutor said mccray told police 
we charged her we got her on the ground and everybody was 
hitting her everybody was stomping and everything and we 
all took turns getting on top of her i just kicked there was a 
whole bunch of us just kicking 
lederer said mccray not only described his actions he 
demonstrated it showing police how he repeatedly kicked the young 
woman 
mccrays lawyer michael joseph said his client initially 
denied involvement in the attack and then the police added 
facts because he was not telling them what they wanted to hear 
defense lawyers also argued that there was no scientific 
evidence linking the defendants to the attack and that without the 
statements the prosecution case is weak at best 
the victim now 29 spent several months in a new york hospital 
before being transferred to connecticut for further rehabilitation 
she recently returned to work at salomon brothers and was promoted 
to vice president 
her name has not been used by the media because of the nature of 
the attack

the supreme courts decision to keep 
nancy cruzan alive should force the missouri legislature to return 
to the righttodie issue which stalled in this years session 
officials said monday 
the court said here you are states you may not want to 
deal with this but were going to dump it in your laps now deal 
with it said senate president pro tem james mathewson he 
predicted the issue will come up before the 1991 legislature which 
convenes in january 
in its 54 ruling the high court said missouri may require 
clear and convincing proof that a patient in a persistent 
vegetative state with no hope of recovery such as ms cruzan 
wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of lifesustaining 
treatment 
ms cruzan 32 has remained for seven years in a comalike 
condition her parents are attempting to get permission to remove 
her feeding tube 
righttodie legislation stalled in the missouri senate during 
the 1990 session proposals endorsed by ms cruzans father and 
state attorney general william webster would have allowed removal 
of food and water if three independent physicians agreed there was 
no chance of recovery after waiting for three years 
webster said the courts ruling leaves it up to individual 
states to set statutory guidelines on what defines clear and 
convincing proof the patient wants to die 
this decision has impact far beyond the borders of the state 
of missouri webster said state courts have been waiting for a 
definitive federal ruling but in this decision today theyve 
essentially said its up to the states he said 
we would like to change the law so that families with 
patients like nancy could receive relief and yet there would still 
be safeguards to protect against those that dont have the best 
interests of the patient at heart webster said 
missouri already is among the 41 states and the district of 
columbia that have living will laws which allow individuals to 
make their wishes about medical treatment known in advance of a 
crisis that may render them unable to speak 
the high court ruled that ms cruzan had not made her wishes 
known before she entered the vegetative state 
sen dennis smith who sponsored some of the righttodie 
legislation said the ruling gives impetus to those who think the 
state should address this very delicate and difficult issue to do 
nothing is to put in jeopardy people who may be in this situation 
an opponent of the legislation louis defeo of the missouri 
catholic conference said it seems the court has taken steps to 
protect the individual that third parties are not to be making 
these ultimate personal decisions 
webster said the catholic conferences opposition was important 
in defeating this years legislation but said he hoped a 
compromise could be reached in the next session

aid poured in monday from dozens of 
countries including irans bitterest enemies to help an estimated 
halfmillion people left homeless in last weeks earthquake 
thousands of people were believed still buried in rubble 
helicopters flew over the stricken area spraying disinfectant 
because of fears the unburied bodies would cause an outbreak of 
disease us health experts said this was unlikely 
an iranian red crescent team pulled a oneyearold girl alive 
from the debris of her home in the mountain village of kelishom 30 
miles east of here according to french and iranian rescue teams 
operating in the area 
the team had been told the infant was dead but found her on her 
bed after digging into the bedroom of her house the iranian 
rescuers said 
the earthquake thursday leveled 342 cities towns and villages 
across northern iran and killed 50000 people by some estimates 
about 200000 were injured and countless others were believed 
lying beneath tons of debris 
tehran universitys geophysics center reported that 22 
aftershocks some as strong as 55 on the richter scale had 
occurred in the region the last 24 hours on sunday the center 
reported 360 tremors since thursday 
the aftershocks caused landslides that blocked roads seriously 
hampering rescue and relief operations in gilan and zanjan 
provinces the two provinces were the hardest hit in the 
earthquake which registered 73 to 77 on the richter scale 
official reports have estimated a halfmillion people were left 
homeless 
at least 62 aircraft carrying foreign aid from dozens of 
countries landed at the capitals mehrabad airport monday irans 
official islamic republic news agency reported sixtyeight 
planeloads arrived sunday tehran radio said 
one cargo jet from the united states brought in 84000 pounds of 
medical food and other supplies from americares a private relief 
organization it was the first private us relief effort after 11 
years of troubled relations between washington and tehran 
at the united nations irans envoy said monday that tehran 
would not accept donations from israel or south africa but it is 
accepting aid from the united states which it once condemned as 
the great satan 
the iranian people do not have any problem with the american 
people said the envoy kamal kharrazi this tragedy may create 
a better atmosphere for relations between iranian and american 
peoples 
aid reportedly was also coming from the unlikeliest of sources 
author salman rushdie who is living under an iranian death threat 
for alleged blasphemy against islam in his novel the satanic 
verses rushdie is donating 8650 to a relief fund the british 
newspaper the independent reported 
its quite clear that at the moment we should be thinking only 
of the humanitarian issue which transcends all other 
discussions rushdie was quoted as saying by independent editor 
andreas whittam smith 
saudi arabia which cut ties with iran in april 1988 said it 
would send 40 planeloads of supplies even iraq irans foe during 
eight years of war offered help 
a landslide monday blocked a 35mile stretch of road linking the 
ravaged town of rudbar with the caspian sea coast a crucial relief 
supply route relief convoys were snarled in traffic jams on other 
roads that were covered by boulders 
but irna reported that nonstop rescue operations continued 
recovery workers aided by police sniffer dogs pulled bodies from 
the rubble it said 
the aftershocks jolted the caspian sea city of rasht gilans 
provincial capital and one of the worst hit cities 
irna said thousands of panicstricken inhabitants fearing more 
buildings would crumble spent the night outdoors 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said air force helicopters 
hovered over inaccessible villages and towns spraying disinfectant 
to avert the spread of diseases from decomposing bodies 
however officials at the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta said the fears were unfounded they said diseases such as 
typhoid and cholera do not occur after disasters even in the 
absence of vaccinations 
irna also monitored in cyprus said the stench of death hung 
over the region 
it quoted an unidentified air force commander as saying the 
tragedy is so grave it cannot be described ive never seen such a 
catastrophe before 
he said that during the 198088 war against iraq we became 
accustomed to transporting many dead and wounded but this is 
different 
the villages are scattered and barely accessible because 
helicopters cannot land in the mountain villages but our pilots 
are determined to do the impossible 
he said one of his pilots suleiman keshavarz lost his mother 
sister brother and nephew they were killed in the village of 
manjil south of rasht 
as soon as the pilot buried them he returned to duty to fly 
relief missions the commander said 
irna also reported that a leading religious authority the grand 
ayatollah mohammad reza golpayegani ruled that victims can be 
buried in mass graves in circumstances where religious rites are 
impossible to observe 
normally the body of a moslem is washed shrouded and prayed 
for in a congregation before it is buried in an individual grave 
mass graves are not allowed under islamic law 
irna said an exact estimate of the casualties was still 
impossible and that a special relief committee so far has 
counted 36907 dead and 35693 injured

the pentagon and congress have reached a 
compromise over a requirement that the department maintain some of 
the sr71 blackbird spy planes for use in a national crisis 
according to a letter released monday 
the air force and congress agreed last year to terminate the top 
secret program opting instead for satellites that could provide 
the same intelligence information for less money 
but in report language accompanying a 4 billion spending bill 
president bush signed last month lawmakers called on the pentagon 
to maintain the aircraft by tail numbers so that flight 
operations could begin within 90 days of an emergency 
defense secretary dick cheney criticized the provision which 
though nonbinding would do serious damage to the relationship 
between congress and the pentagon if the department ignored it 
the air force and congressional committees negotiated a 
compromise that cheney detailed in a june 21 letter to sen robert 
c byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
we will place three sr71a aircraft and six associated 
reconnaissance sensors and electronic countermeasure suites into 
longterm storage as a hedge against a protracted conflict some 
time in the future cheney said in the letter 
the time it will take and the cost of restoring these stored 
aircraft and sensors to a condition that would support safe 
operations will depend on the length of the storage period 
the defense secretary also said the pentagon will make trainer 
aircraft two sr71a aircraft flight simulator and all associated 
sr71 spares and support equipment available for loan or transfer 
to nasa 
the space agency according to a memorandum from cheney to air 
force secretary donald rice would assume the cost for operating 
and maintaining the aircraft and parts 
no estimate was included in the letter 
cheney said reconnaissance operations involving the black 
daggershaped planes could not resume in a safe manner on 
90day notice he also noted that maintenance crews air crews and 
other personnel with skills to operate and care for the blackbird 
are gone 
we no longer have an sr71 flight capability cheney said 
during more than two decades of service the blackbird regularly 
flew missions over heavily defended north vietnam and provided 
intelligence in many other regions including the middle east 
china and the persian gulf 
the plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been 
shot down 
in march in a flight marking its retirement a blackbird set a 
record for a coasttocoast flight flying from los angeles to 
washington dc in 68 minutes 17 seconds

the izvestia newspaper on monday scolded 
byelorussias conservative communist party chief for attacking 
mikhail s gorbachev at a local party congress last week 
in a speech to the byelorussian communist party yefrem sokolov 
said from our point of view much of the blame for our ships 
loss of its anchors and its crews sickness lies with those who 
command the ship and lay out its course izvestia said sokolov 
did not mention the soviet president and national communist party 
chief by name izvestia said 
izvestia also quoted the reply printed in the byelorussian 
newspaper banner of youth 
one is bursting to ask the rebellious boatswains of the ship 
didnt they feel sick when singing a chorus of hallelujahs to the 
former captains senile old men who hung stars on their chests for 
grounding the ship 
hardline communists have called for gorbachevs replacement as 
head of the national communist party at its congress set to begin 
july 2 politburo member yegor ligachev has been reported as 
planning to run against gorbachev and many of the congress 
delegates are conservatives opposed to gorbachevs reforms 
also monday the estonian news service said in an unconfirmed 
report that the national party congress may be postponed 
effectively putting off the expected challenge to gorbachev 
estonian television echoed the report but no other soviet media 
reported possibilities of delay 
party officials were still preparing for the congress monday 
and a soviet foreign ministry official said he knew nothing of any 
such report 
the estonian news service which recently replaced the local 
affiliate of the official soviet news agency tass said vadim 
medvedev the main ideologist of the communist party of the soviet 
union informed the estonian central committee that the 28th party 
congress might be postponed until september 
the reason for it was said to be the harvest that had 
started in the southern region of the soviet union the news 
service said only a handful of farmers are expected at the 
congress and the harvest hardly an unexpected event is still 
weeks away in most of the country 
the party congress originally scheduled for 1991 was moved up 
to autumn of this year and finally to july as the need for 
radical reform grew

editor steve hager said monday that he and two other employees 
of the magazine with a 250000 monthly distribution have been 
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in new orleans on june 29 
usa today reported monday that federal prosecutors in new 
orleans were investigating whether the magazine should be indicted 
as a drug conspiracy 
high times plans to challenge the subpoena and hager said he 
does not plan to go or to provide the business records and other 
information that was requested 
if i do go down it will be to take the fifth amendment the 
bill of rights is being systematically dismantled in the name of 
the war on drugs he said 
im not exactly clear what it is theyre trying to do its 
basically just a big fishing expedition to try to put us out of 
business hager added 
john volz the us attorney in new orleans was in court and 
could not be immediately reached for comment monday 
hager said the magazine is outspoken in its support of a 
movement to legalize marijuana but advises people to stay away 
from hard drugs and other damaging substances including tobacco 
heroin and alcohol 
these are poisonous substances you could smoke 500 pounds of 
marijuana and you wouldnt die he said 
usa today said the drug enforcement administration in october 
searched businesses that advertised garden equipment in high times 
and arrested about 400 people for marijuana possession and other 
offenses 
high times subsequently lost twothirds of its advertising said 
hager 
this magazine would be bigger than playboy if it werent for 
government intervention hager said 
the magazine was founded in 1974 
basically the magazines been through a 16year period of 
pretty constant harassment from the government this is the first 
time theyve started a criminal investigation aimed at trying to 
create problems for us he said 
this prosecutor in new orleans is just trying to get a lot of 
publicity for himself hes got a terrible case hager said 
were not going to have any problem surviving theres at least 
20 to 30 million people who use marijuana in our society

the republic of slovenia plans to 
begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty 
within a new yugoslav confederation the state tanjug news agency 
reported monday 
slovenia whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of 
yugoslavias total population of 23 million is the most 
politically liberal and prosperous of the countrys six member 
republics 
slovenia should be set up as a sovereign state with all 
attributes of factual authority and with full internationallegal 
rights tanjug said quoting from a declaration of the slovenian 
presidency the top local ruling body 
the slovenian move was endorsed by slovenias president milan 
kucan who told a monday session of the presidency that the new 
constitution will be the constitution of the sovereign state of 
slovenia and not of one of the federal republics tanjug said 
the proposal is to be discussed by slovenias parliament in 
midjuly kucan said its approval is viewed as almost certain 
slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the 
media in yugoslavias more conservative southern republics and 
particularly in the countrys largest republic of serbia of 
harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests 
at the expense of federal goals 
slovenian authorities claim serbia is trying to politically and 
economically dominate the yugoslav federation by introducing 
greater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of the 
republics 
more than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republic 
believe their region might be better off if it were outside the 
yugoslav federation results of a public opinion poll said last 
march 
only 15 percent of the slovenes surveyed expressed their wish 
for slovenia to remain a republic within yugoslavia in the present 
form 
both slovenia and croatia the two yugoslav republics that held 
free elections this year have proclaimed a readiness to turn the 
yugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into a 
looser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily 
also monday serbias president slobodan milosevic in a speech 
to the serbian parliament said the new constitution serbia is 
preparing is designed to offset the transformation of federal 
yugoslavia into a confederation

canadian leaders sought to reassure foreign 
governments and investors that the failure of a constitutional 
accord did not threaten the country with instability and financial 
markets reacted calmly monday 
the canadian dollar held steady against the us dollar on north 
american markets prompting relief among canadian officials who 
feared the death of the socalled meech lake accord might trigger a 
run on its currency 
its a calm response a steady response a realistic 
response said finance minister michael wilson they feel its 
not a time for snap decisions 
external affairs minister joe clark and derek burney canadas 
ambassador to the united states were both scheduled to appear on 
us television programs monday in an effort to dispel fears that 
canada was on the verge of breaking up 
the constitutional accord which would have recognized 
frenchspeaking quebec as a distinct society failed to meet a 
midnight saturday deadline for obtaining the required ratification 
by all 10 provincial legislatures 
it was effectively torpedoed by newfoundland premier clyde wells 
and elijah harper a cree indian lawmaker in manitoba who blocked 
the legislatures in their provinces from considering the accord 
before the deadline expired 
on sunday wilson appealed to international money markets not to 
react with alarm to meech lakes failure he issued a statement 
reminding investors that canada had enjoyed an unparalleled 
investment boom in the past few years 
quebec premier robert bourassa interviewed in mondays wall 
street journal said there were no dangers to his provinces 
economy 
bourassa said he would in no way take any decision adversely 
affecting the economic security of quebecers 
the canadian dollar closed monday at 8485 us cents in 
toronto unchanged from fridays close the toronto stock market 
was down moderately in light trading at the close as the tse 
composite index dropped 1656 to 347416 
analysts said bourassas remarks over the weekend that quebec 
would not take any precipitate action had helped calm the situation 
there have been fears that meech lakes demise would lead to an 
intensified separatist drive in quebec 
bourassa declared he would no longer negotiate quebecs status 
with the other provincial premiers or return to the constitutional 
bargaining table but he said quebec officials would make no 
decisions on the provinces future course until the fall 
but some quebecers were not prepared to bide their time 
in montreal several thousand people celebrating the provinces 
national holiday st john the baptist day marched through 
downtown streets sunday shouting separatist slogans 
about 500 nationalist supporters broke into olympic stadium 
disrupting the montrealpittsburgh baseball game for about 10 
minutes 
our country is quebec and our problem is canada one 
demonstrator robert paradis 50 shouted as security staff led him 
away from the ballpark 
in english canada some newspapers greeted the demise of meech 
lake with relief while others appealed for a coolingoff period 
and national unity 
the toronto sun wrote whatever the case it was past time for 
meech to die it was an unacceptable deal it divided the country 
ontarios london free press commented in the aftermath of the 
meech lake disaster politicians who care about the survival of 
canada should stop blaming one another for the dangerous divisions 
brought on by this debacle and concentrate instead on healing the 
nations wounds 
prime minister brian mulroney appeared to be the biggest loser 
from meech lakes demise mulroney whose approval rating stood at 
about 16 percent in the polls before the weekend had hoped the 
accord would reverse his political misfortunes 
brian mulroney wanted to be in the history books as the man 
who unified canada wrote the ottawa citizen his desperation 
to achieve that distinction led him to dubious tactics 
the meech lake accord named after the resort outside ottawa 
where it was drawn up three years ago was the culmination of a 
long effort to win quebecs signature on the 1982 canadian 
constitution its purpose was to draw the everwary quebecers into 
the canadian family unifying a country frequently beset by 
problems of regionalism 
the accord recognized quebecs status as a distinct society 
within canada but its opponents feared it would give the 
frenchspeaking province special privileges 
the telegraphyjournal in saint john new brunswick noted wryly 
that the meech lake furor had changed canadas image as a boring 
nation 
the image of canadian stability has been shattered the 
newspaper wrote we were seen as a bland even unexciting country 
which would never do anything to rock the boat now we are 
perceived in the us media as a nation on the verge of breakup

a former ku klux klan members effort to 
end all programs that give minorities an advantage in hiring was 
blocked monday by a state senate committee 
the senate finance committee voted 62 to sit on rep david 
dukes bill thus apparently killing it for the session which ends 
july 9 the house overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this 
month 
ill try to get the senate to force the committee to report 
the bill to the floor duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux 
klan said later 
duke a republican from metairie and a candidate for the us 
senate said his bill merely prohibits discrimination in favor or 
against anyone on the basis of race 
members of the black caucus in the house referred to my bill 
as racist that word is an epithet people use to silence 
opposition i dont believe we should run for cover when that word 
is used 
if discrimination is wrong when exercised against a minority 
its wrong when exercised against a white majority 
democratic sen je jumonville said the bill does nothing 
because no state law can supercede federal laws that allow programs 
that compensate for past discrimination 
i know you are a candidate for the us senate and this makes 
good political hay said jumonville but are we really doing 
anything i think its window dressing 
duke told reporters after the hearing that opponents pulled a 
dirty political trick by sending my bill to the finance committee 
there are no republicans on this committee 
of the 39 senators five are republicans 
duke is running for the senate as a maverick member of the party 
the gop chose state sen ben bagert of new orleans as its 
nominee to oppose incumbent us sen bennett johnston a democrat 
who has held the post since 1972

at the headquarters of the red crescent 
society irans equivalent of the red cross the sidewalk and lobby 
are stacked high with donated blankets clothes food stoves and 
medicine 
dozens of volunteers sort through the piles boxing them for 
shipment to the northwest where a halfmillion people have been 
made homeless as a result of thursdays killer earthquake 
many people come here to donate goods for the earthquake 
victims but then stay for the day to help out javad afshar 
director of public cooperation for the red crescent said monday 
irans internal relief effort following the quake has been 
speedy and thorough a team from the genevabased united nations 
disaster relief organization said 
the earthquake leveled cities and towns across northern iran and 
killed 50000 people according to official iranian estimates 
about 200000 were injured and countless others were believed 
beneath tons of debris 
the response was largescale rapid and efficient the 
mission said in a report monday the numbers of relief personnel 
ambulances and heavy equipment appeared to be more than adequate 
for the task 
it said it was most impressed by the relief response 
iranian relief officials credited the speed of the relief effort to 
equipment and experience left over from the 198088 iraniraq war 
and to strong suppport from the iranian people 
at the red crescent afshars voice was hoarse monday after what 
he said were 72 hours of directing volunteers and working three 
telephones and a walkietalkie without any sleep 
but im not tired he said theres an iranian proverb 
that says that all people come from one body if one part is in 
pain then the other parts also feel it 
at the baghi allahalazam military hospital 144 of the 400 
beds were occupied by earthquake victims most of them evacuated by 
army helicopter 
during the iraniraq war we regularly received injured 
patients by helicopter from the front said jamshid narenjkar 
director of the hospital one of about 15 military medical centers 
in the tehran area 
because of the war doctors and nurses were ready to help 
he said 
narenjkar said about 4000 victims were hospitalized in tehran 
and many others elsewhere 
meanwhile international humanitarian aid from both allies and 
past enemies continued to pour into tehrans mehrabad airport 
where more than a dozen aircraft from west germany algeria cuba 
bangladesh and pakistan waited to be unloaded 
the iranian air force was airlifting the aid to the earthquake 
zone where road traffic was badly clogged by heavy construction 
machinery and buses carrying thousands of relief workers 
ground crews worked in the heat of the tarmac of the airports 
military section as they transfered hundreds of tons of cargo to 
waiting c130 hercules transport planes to fly the supplies to the 
disaster zone 
air force officers said their pilots were averaging six to eight 
flights a day to the mountainous region about 170 miles northwest 
of the capital 
once we reach the area the supplies are transferred to the 
helicopters which fly them out to villages so remote they are 
almost inaccessible by any other means said lt col fridoon 
zadeh an air force pilot 
john tomblin a un disaster relief organization director said 
more than two dozen nations have provided quake aid to iran the 
islamic republic news agency said 26 countries have contributed to 
the relief operations 
more than 40 german military personnel and medical volunteers 
waited with their gear monday for their flight to rudbar one of 
the hardest hit towns on the border between the devastated zanjan 
and gilan provinces 
the german volunteers were to set up a field hospital in the 
town 
on sunday a us cargo plane carrying 84000 pounds of supplies 
from americares a private us relief organization unloaded at 
mehrabad airport then flew back 
it was the first american aid to iran since the rift that 
followed the rise of islamic fundamentalists to power 11 years ago 
iranian officials monday stressed that they were not rejecting 
outside help but did not need large amounts of foreign relief 
personnel 
we havent asked other countries for help because our people 
and our government were ready the red crescents afshar said 
but if other countries and red cross societies offer to help 
we will accept it with thanks

donald trumps casino workers are 
offering him pieces of their paychecks his betting patrons wish 
him well but city officials are nervously watching whats doing 
with the man who means 14500 jobs 
as a midnight tuesday deadline neared for trump to make an 
overdue 43 million bond payment on his trump castle casino resort 
by the bay bankers apparently were scrambling to win approval from 
two foreign banks balking at a rescue package for the developer 
city and industry officials were trying to gauge the effect of 
trumps troubles on the already clouded image of this stagnating 
casino town 
the consensus monday seemed to be that trump would slide to 
safety without bankruptcy but perhaps at the cost of selling one 
of his three casinos 
trump officials have said none of the properties is for sale 
the trump organization and donald trump himself are shrewd 
enough to work themselves out of it said michael derogatis head 
of the greater atlantic city chamber of commerce you would have 
to say that if somebody needs money and has these properties it 
makes sense to sell one of them 
roy silbert president of local 54 of the hotel employees and 
restaurant union agreed and said trumps workers are loyal the 
union represents about 4500 of trumps roughly 14500 employees 
and 16000 of the industrys 50000 laura mcnichol a manager in 
the game room for teenagers at trump castle said shed donate a 
days pay if it would ease her boss burden she declined to say 
how much she earns 
i think the man is a business genius said ms mcnichol who 
took the job four months ago does he really need help i dont 
know but id do it if he does 
she said about six other workers discussed the prospect of 
helping trump trump castle spokesman bob arrow said he hadnt 
heard of such a movement 
mr trump is going to solve his problems arrow said 
trump also is flush with fans outside his work force 
i think that anybody who has worked at something deserves to 
keep it said madeline spinello of smithtown ny she and her 
husband lost 500 in their latest foray into trump castle where 
players scoffed at the superstition that says its bad luck to 
gamble at a troubled casino 
i dont know why people are jealous said thomas weber of 
allentown pa they had the same opportunities he had 
barry durman executive director of the atlantic city rescue 
mission said trump has been a good corporate neighbor trump plaza 
donated 10000 at christmas when the 250bed mission faced 
financial troubles of its own and trump castle donates 250300 
meals a day 
trumps massive taj mahal casino resort which opened april 2 
is expected to bring atlantic city 516 million in spending by 
conventiongoers in its first year said blair learn of the 
convention amp visitors bureau 
his name alone brings this city a lot of attention learn said 
but mayorelect jim whelan said he doesnt know what atlantic 
city could do in return if trump needs help 
im not sure theres anything we can do whelan said its 
not like we can lend him money ultimately donald is going to 
have to sell some properties 
casino association president thomas carver said trumps woes 
illustrate the high cost of doing business here whatever your 
name and of chasing a market that wont grow unless the state 
loosens industry regulations 
if these three casinos were operated by other people it 
wouldnt make any difference in the flat growth of the 
industry carver said

an inmate was convicted monday of murdering two 
detectives by shooting them as they drove him to jail 
this was more than murder it was an execution district 
attorney john j santucci said after the verdict he said he would 
seek the maximum term 63 years to life in prison for jay 
stoney harrison 
the state jury deliberated for less than an hour to reach its 
verdict 
detectives richard guerzon 46 and keith williams 34 were 
slain nov 13 while transporting harrison from queens borough hall 
after he met with lawyers on another murder charge for which he 
has yet to be tried 
harrison 25 had been handcuffed by one hand to a pipe on a 
table in the squad room while briefly unguarded he apparently 
managed to reach into a police locker that had a broken lock and 
remove a gun 
in the back seat of the officers car with his hands handcuffed 
in front of him he drew the gun and shot the detectives as they 
drove back to rikers island jail prosecutors said 
authorities later said the prisoner should not have been 
unguarded in the squad room and should have had his hands cuffed 
behind his back in the car 
harrison originally was arrested on charges of killing his 
exgirlfriend in 1988 and conspiring to kill an accomplice to the 
murder harrison had been brought to borough hall to discuss a plea 
bargain on those charges 
in addition to murder he was convicted monday of escape grand 
larceny and weapons possession he is to be sentenced by july 25

the us government has provided 291000 in 
emergency relief supplies and transportation to aid earthquake 
victims in iran but has no reason to expect the donation in itself 
will improve frayed usiranian relations the white house said 
monday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the aid includes 
blankets tents water jugs and search and rescue equipment 
the supplies were airlifted from pisa italy where they had been 
stored for emergencies to iran by a swiss aircraft under charter to 
the american red cross they were given to the iranian red crescent 
society for distribution 
fitzwater said the united states would try to be responsive if 
other iranian relif needs are identified 
this in our judgment is a humanitarian gesture a response to 
the tragedy of the earthquake fitzwater said 
but we dont anticpate that it has any larger political 
consequences he said

zaires roman catholic bishops have 
condemned last months massacre of students at a university in 
southern zaire and asked their government to investigate the 
incident a belgian newspaper reported monday 
dozens of students reportedly died in the may 12 clash with 
security forces at the university of lubumbashi the incident has 
led to another breakdown in relations between belgium and its 
former central african colony over alleged human rights abuses 
the daily het volk said zaires bishops issued a declaration 
earlier this month that demanded total clarification of the 
tragic events of lubumbashi 
they also accused zaires president mobutu sese seko of paying 
lip service to the process of democratization he announced april 24 
het volk said it had obtained a copy of the sixpage statement 
in which the bishops condemned the militarization of university 
campuses 
we forcefully condemn the general use of security forces 
according to the bishops statement which was published by het 
volk 
the bishops added that security forces were being used for the 
suppression of and interference with the lives of peaceful citizens 
in particular we condemn strongly and without reservation the 
massacres which in all likelihood were carried out against students 
on the campus of the university of lubumbashi the bishops said 
belgian media have reported that dozens of students died in 
clashes on the campus with a special unit of mobutus personal 
guard the dispute broke out over charges that some university 
students were spies for mobutu 
on may 25 belgium froze its relations with zaire and called for 
an independent inquiry into the event zairean officials have 
rejected this 
belgium has stuck to its call for an impartial probe that led 
mobutu last friday to reduce diplomatic and other ties with belgium 
he suspended belgianzairean development accords expelled some 
700 belgian development workers closed down three of the four 
belgian consulates and reduced the number of weekly flights 
between brussels and kinshasa by sabena the belgian national 
airline 
on sunday belgian foreign minister mark eyskens said the 
international monetary fund and the world bank have no intention 
of granting more aid to zaire if it breaks relations with belgium 
he said belgium wanted to maintain good relations with zaire and 
again rejected the notion that the belgian governments reaction 
represented interference in zaires internal affairs 
in human rights matters there is no foreign interference 
eyskens said on belgian television 
the new belgianzairean dispute erupted less than three months 
after the two countries reconciled a previous breakdown in 
relations it comes one week before observances marking the 30th 
anniversary of zaires independence belgium has not been invited 
to attend the ceremonies 
mobuto has ruled zaire a nation of 25 million since 1965 when 
he took power in a coup

ariel sharon for declaring that soviet immigrants would not be sent 
to the west bank and gaza 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said sharons statement was a 
step in the right direction even though it was not clear 
whether sharon was barring the refugees from the territories or 
simply saying they would not be settled there at israeli government 
expense 
we have seen various reports and we dont yet have a detailed 
analysis ms tutwiler said 
meanwhile osama albaz the principal foreign policy adviser to 
egyptian president hosni mubarak called at the state department 
without advance notice 
he met with dennis ross director of the departments policy 
planning staff and john h kelly the assistant secretary of state 
for the near east 
ross and kelly are the principal advisers on the middle east to 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
a us official declining to be identified said middle east 
peace efforts and egypts economic plight were discussed 
egypt is the principal us channel to the arab world in trying 
to open negotiations between israel and palestinians 
the process halted in march when the israeli government 
collapsed over a plan by baker that would have required negotiating 
with palestinians deported from the west bank 
the formation of a new government in jerusalem and its 
declared interest in a settlement inspired the bush 
administration to begin again 
on saturday president bush spoke on the telephone with mubarak 
the egyptian leader then sent albaz and foreign minister esmat 
abdel meguid to washington 
meguid will meet with bush on tuesday 
among the us objectives is halting jewish settlement of the 
west bank and gaza which the arabs lost in the 1967 mideast war 
and hope to recover as well as in east jerusalem which is part of 
israels capital 
sharon in an important gesture said sunday we do not divert 
and we do not send any russian immigrants or any jew who comes from 
russia to samaria to judea to gaza because we understand the 
seriousness of the situation 
he added our efforts in resettling immigrants are directed to 
this side of the green line 
sharon is one of israels strongest advocates of jewish 
settlement on the land he referred to by their biblical names but 
the united states the soviet union and the arabs are opposed even 
though very few russian jews have gone to the territories 
mr sharons statement is a hopeful development as it responds 
to international concerns including our own ms tutwiler said 
however the bush administration isnt ready to unfreeze a 400 
million loan guarantee to help israel build badly needed homes for 
the historic tide of jewish immigrants from the soviet union 
ms tutwiler said the administration was still seeking 
assurances from jerusalem but declined to say what they were or 
whether they had to be in writing 
baker last week made a gesture of his own to israel while 
holding talks in europe on germanys future 
he said palestinians would talk to israel only with the 
acquiescence of the palestine liberation organization but baker 
said the bush administration was not trying to steer israel into 
talks with the plo itself 
israel regards the plo as a terrorist organization the plo is 
committed in its covenant to dismantling the jewish state last 
wednesday the bush administration broke off talks with the plo 
over an attempted raid against israel three weeks earlier

wenceslas square on oct 28 1988 the rally had been called by 
independent groups to mark the 70th anniversary of czechoslovak 
independence with demands for reforms and greater freedom 
at the time stepan was head of the prague defense council

a judge rejected a plea agreement monday and 
ordered trial for a warehouse owner who rigged a shotgun booby trap 
that killed a teenage intruder 
whats next punji sticks claymore mines bouncing betties 
denver district judge richard spriggs said 
tossing out the suspended sentence agreed upon by a prosecutor 
spriggs ordered philip connaghan 46 of arvada to stand trial for 
reckless manslaughter and a misdemeanor charge of violating the 
states booby trap law 
spriggs said the loss of 19yearold michael mccombs life is 
nonjustifiable and to me deferred judgment does not seem 
warranted 
a booby trap is a deadly device without mercy or distinction 
brutally savage and inhumane the judge said 
district attorney norm early and connaghans attorney bob 
ransome had reached an agreement whereby connaghan would plead 
guilty to the two charges in exchange he would have served no 
jail time and his record was to have been wiped clean 
early and ransome argued that connaghan had been burglarized 
repeatedly and had tried other means of thwarting burglars before 
setting the trap after mccombs death connaghan was remorseful 
they said 
but spriggs ordered early and ransome to prepare motions by aug 
21 and said connaghan will face trial no later than dec 24 
the manslaughter conviction would carry a penalty of up to eight 
years in prison while the misdemeanor count is punishable by a 
fine up to 5000 and one year in jail 
the booby trap set at connaghans warehouse near downtown denver 
killed mccomb during a breakin the night of april 14 when mccomb 
entered the warehouse with three friends 
mccomb whom authorities said had burglarized the warehouse at 
least once previously died of a single blast to the chest from the 
12gauge shotgun the three juveniles were not injured and face 
possible burglary charges 
spriggs said that while mccomb was breaking the law when he 
entered connaghans warehouse that was not sufficient reason for 
him to die 
its also been suggested that the victim in the case mccomb 
subscribed to a belief all of us find reprehensible spriggs 
said referring to reports that mccomb was a skinhead who 
subscribed to racist beliefs 
connaghan warehouse where he kept various personal effects 
had been burglarized several times before the april 14 incident he 
once lost about 7000 worth of tools 
connaghan set two shotgun booby traps in the warehouse after it 
was burglarized in january during another burglary in march one 
of the booby traps was tripped but malfunctioned he dismantled 
one of the traps but told authorities he forgot to disarm the 
second one 
early said connaghan had taken other measures to protect his 
property before setting the booby trap including blocking the 
entrance with parked vehicles and placing bars on the windows 
connaghan even had leased a pit bull but it either was stolen or 
escaped early said 
he didnt want to injure anyone in fact he had intended to 
disarm the gun early said 
but connaghan had promised police he would disarm the booby 
trap spriggs said 
the fact remains he didnt take it down he said

congress on monday approved and sent to the 
white house new amtrak legislation devoid of the railroad 
antitakeover provision that drew a veto from president bush 
the bill was approved by a voice vote first in the house and 
then in the senate 
the legislation caps federal subsidies for the governmentowned 
passenger railroad at 684 million in the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 and at 712 million in fiscal 1992 
in vetoing an earlier version bush said he accepted the 
spending figures but objected to a plan which would have required 
interstate commerce commission approval of railroad takeovers by 
nonrailroad companies 
the house voted to override bushs veto but the senate narrowly 
failed to get the needed twothirds majority to enact the bill over 
his objections 
because the presidents concerns have been addressed the 
current version of the bill is acceptable to the administration 
the white house said in a statement monday 
rep thomas a luken dohio chairman of the house subcommittee 
on transportation said the bill authorizes enough money for amtrak 
to replace and upgrade its passenger cars 
however while the bill caps the amtrak allocation the actual 
amount will be determined later in a separate spending bill 
in addition to amtrak service the bill would clear legal 
impediments to the start of new commuter rail service between 
northern virginia and the district of columbia

the dark figure who visits edgar allan poes 
grave every year was captured on film by a photographer who used 
surveillance equipment to snap the only known picture of the annual 
rite 
but the identity of the man remains a mystery worthy of poe the 
patriarch of american mystery writers the photographer did not 
approach the shadowy figure or try to spoil his secret 
every jan 19 since at least 1949 on the anniversary of poes 
birthday someone has left three roses and a bottle of cognac on 
the writers grave poe died in baltimore in 1849 
life magazine in the july issue that hit newsstands monday 
includes a picture of the figure during his earlymorning visit 
bill ballenberg a freelance photographer in new york spent 
17000 from life to rent infrared nightvision equipment which 
he set up facing poes original grave and the monument he rests 
beneath 
when the darkly clad visitor appeared at the grave at 3 am 
ballenberg took the picture by a remote radio signal from inside 
westminster hall the presbyterian church that overlooks the 
graveyard 
we had about 30 seconds it was really fast it was like 12 
hours of boredom punctuated by 30 seconds of terror ballenberg 
said in a telephone interview monday 
jeff jerome curator of the edgar allen poe house allowed the 
photographer and a magazine writer to wait with him for the visitor 
last jan 19 the 181st anniversary of the writers birth the two 
agreed not to try to nab identify talk to or otherwise disturb 
the visitor 
the picture shows the back of a man kneeling at the grave where 
poe was buried for 26 years because the photo was taken with a 
nightscope which intensified the available light 35000 times the 
somewhat fuzzy photo shows only the visitor and the grave within a 
circle of light 
i could see his body i never could see his face no one could 
see his face he had a hat and a scarf pulled up well around his 
face securing his face ballenberg said 
poe died at the age of 40 after being discovered in a delirium 
on a baltimore street in 1848 he had stepped off a steamer and was 
en route to new york after visiting his childhood sweetheart in 
richmond va 
the circumstances of his death remain unclear some researchers 
of poe attributed his state to a fever others pointed to the late 
stages of alcoholism and a deteriorating mind 
for 26 years poes remains lay under a mediumsized stone in 
the graveyard a larger monument was erected in front of the 
downtown burial ground and he was reinterred in 1875 
jerome who became curator in 1979 and began the overnight 
vigils has been accused of orchestrating the visits which he 
denies but he said he uses the publicity and annual birthday 
celebrations to draw attention to the works of the writer 
witnesses accounts indicate that several different men have 
brought the cognac and roses in the 40 years since the offerings 
were spotted by the church curator 
no one else will be allowed to photograph the mysterious 
visitor jerome said 
this was a once in a lifetime chance

health secretary louis sullivan said monday he 
was outraged that unamerican protesters prevented him from 
being heard at an aids conference but the incident would not 
reduce his commitment to fight the disease 
sullivan said the demonstrators who shouted whistled and threw 
wads of paper at him as he spoke sunday in san francisco stepped 
over the line of legitimate protest and were unamerican and 
he will have nothing to do with their organizers any more 
the secretary in an interview monday evening said he had been 
aware that his speech to the closing session of the sixth

target of protesters but he said he had not expected to be drowned

simply make a point but their intent was to prevent me from making

china has ended the yearlong isolation of 
dissident fang lizhi in hopes of ending its own estrangement from 
the united states and other western nations 
astrophysicist fang and his wife li shuxian a physicist 
arrived in upper heyford a us base 60 miles west of london late 
monday on a us air force jet after the government allowed them to 
leave the us embassy where they had been living since june 1989 
beijing cited leniency in allowing the couple wanted by 
police as counterrevolutionary criminals to leave monday but the 
decision was based more on diplomatic than humanitarian concerns 
it was the latest and most important gesture aimed at returning 
to the good graces of the west 
china has been stunned by western condemnation of the military 
suppression of the prodemocracy movement last june that forced 
fang and his wife chinas leading advocates of democratic reform 
to seek refuge in the us embassy 
western nations suspended highlevel contacts invited chinese 
studying in their countries to stay and blocked governmental and 
world bank loans to china 
government spokesman yuan mu in an interview last week with 
japanese reporters acknowledged that restrictions on development 
loans had hurt he said china cannot put its trust in impractical 
selfwishes for better relations with the west 
china has made several diplomatic gestures this year directed at 
ending its ostracism it lifted martial law in beijing in january 
and ended more than a year of martial law in the tibetan capital of 
lhasa on may 1 
since december nearly 900 people arrested in connection with 
the prodemocracy protests last spring have been released the 
government has stressed that chinese students both in china and 
abroad will not be prosecuted merely for joining prodemocracy 
protests 
fangs release removes a major impediment to improved uschina 
relations which seriously deterioriated after the military 
crackdown 
relations have hit the bottom a foreign ministry official 
said monday they have no place to go but up 
he added however that china is puzzled by the tendency in 
the west to discount chinas goodwill gestures as cosmetic 
western critics say china in reality has done little to improve 
its human rights record they note that although martial law ended 
in beijing thousands of troops remain in the city to crush any 
attempt at political protest 
and although fang was allowed to leave the country many 
wellknown figures among them student leader wang dan political 
scientist liu xiaobo senior party official bao tong and political 
activist ren wanding face long prison terms as alleged 
counterrevolutionaries 
thousands who joined in the protests last year are still in jail 
without having been charged or tried 
fangs release was timed to coincide with debate in the us 
congress on giving china mostfavorednation trading status 
many members of congress citing chinas human rights record 
have opposed president bushs decision to extend the trade status 
which gives china low tariffs on exports to the united states 
resolution of the fang case also comes just before the western 
nations hold their annual summit in houston one question at the 
july summit will be whether to continue opposing loans to china by 
international financial organizations such as the world bank 
even before the decision to release fang cracks were appearing 
in western sanctions on china the bush administration has approved 
world bank loans on a human need basis and the bank has pushed 
ahead with 590 million in credit to china 
japanese foreign ministry officials indicated monday that fangs 
release would create a favorable environment for reopening 
talks on a 52 billion fiveyear loan package to china 
as fang left for britain a highranking member of the west 
german or parliament held talks with premier li peng a communist 
party politburo member li tieying was preparing for a visit to 
japan and a senior british official is scheduled to visit beijing 
next month for talks on hong kong 
rapid improvement in uschina relations is unlikely although 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater praised fangs release as a 
farsighted significant step that will improve the atmosphere 
for progress in our bilateral relations 
one country where fangs release will go largely unnoticed is 
china 
the tightly controlled official press has rarely reported on 
fang except to condemn him his departure from china received only 
short mention in the middle of the national evening news after 
reports on a meeting on agriculture policy and a discourse on state 
financial affairs

protectionism against imports costs third 
world countries twice as much as they get in foreign aid world 
bank president barber conable wrote to president bush 
nobody will benefit from fragmentation of the world trading 
system conable wrote the worlds poor stand to lose the 
most 
in 1988 the last year for which complete figures are available 
aid reached 48 billion the united states is the largest single 
contributor though it ranks close to the bottom when its own wealth 
is taken into account 
the world bank owned by 152 governments is the biggest source 
of aid lending over 20 billion a year 
if the industrial countries dismantled their barriers to 
imports the third world could raise its income by 3 percent 
conable figured the barriers take the form of import duties 
quotas that limit the size of imports and subsidies that the 
governments of industrial countries give to their own farms and 
industry 
conables letter dated june 18 was made available monday 
the next few months of 1990 may well be as crucial for freer 
trade as the last few months of 1989 were for freer peoples he 
wrote 
he said the leaders of seven governments whom bush will host 
july 9 in houston should break the deadlock in four years of 
worldwide trade talks this uruguay round has been stalled by a 
clash between the united states and the 12 governments of the 
european economic community over subsidies to farm products 
the bush administration wants exporting countries to end the 
subsidies they give to foreign sales the europeans want all kinds 
of farm subsidies reduced reducing subsidies given by the 
governments of industrial countries would help the third world sell 
its own products 
subsidies to farming are estimated to cost hundreds of billions 
of dollars a year to taxpayers and consumers of the industrial 
countries 
it is imperative that the interests of developing countries 
are fully represented in any agreement breaking the deadlock 
conable said 
agreement embracing all parties would benefit developing 
country exporters and importers especially in agriculture and in 
textiles and clothing

the organization of reform rabbis broke with 
4000 years of jewish tradition monday and endorsed homosexual 
rabbis as qualified leaders of congregations in the united states 
and canada 
the central conference of american rabbis meeting for its 101st 
annual convention overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging that 
all rabbis regardless of sexual orientation be accorded the 
opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation which they have chosen 
the conference is the organization of 1550 rabbis in the reform 
movement which has 13 million congregational members in the 
united states 
its an exciting day said rabbi denise eger the lesbian 
leader of beth chayim chadashim a primarily homosexual 
congregation in los angeles 
some estimates have said as many as 10 percent of us reform 
rabbis are homosexual 
the resolution was put forth by a 17member committee that 
adopted it unanimously after four years of study and debate 
the final resolution stated the committees majority position in 
affirming that homosexual unions are not on a par with 
heterosexual monogamous procreative marriages which were 
specified as the jewish ideal 
but a minority of the committee was able to insert a statement 
affirming the equal possibility of covenantal fulfillment in 
both homosexual and heterosexual relationships 
creating a traditional jewish home is considered a religious 
duty to the extent that sexual orientation is a matter of 
choice the majority of the committee affirmed in the resolution 
heterosexuality is the only appropriate choice 
in an interview before the vote rabbi samuel karff of houston 
conference president and a committee member said the committees 
unanimity in supporting homosexual rabbis had been contingent on 
emphasizing that distinction 
what emerges on the one hand is a desire to affirm support for 
our colleagues who are gay and lesbian and on the other hand we 
feel it essential to maintain our link to basic jewish norms he 
said 
jewish law embodied in the torah and other texts condemns 
homosexuality as an abomination but out of concern for human 
dignity one is permitted to violate the prohibitions of torah 
karff said 
about 500 conference members are attending the fourday 
convention which ends wednesday the conference originated in the 
united states but now includes reform rabbis worldwide 
a twothirds vote was needed to pass the resolution which 
stated it was an attempt to address the issue only in the united 
states and canada 
a 45minute debate preceded the voice vote with most rabbis 
expressing support and some calling for an even stronger statement 
others worried the resolution pushes the limits of judaism too far 
it will be an angle for enemies of reform judaism and those 
who are neutral to use this as yet another weapon as a challenge to 
our authenticity said rabbi clifford librach of congregation 
moses montefiore in bloomington ill 
reform judaism is the largest and most liberal of the three main 
branches of judaism in 1972 it became the first branch to ordain 
a woman rabbi 
the conservative jewish movement has had women rabbis since 1985 
but it does not openly accept homosexual rabbis orthodox jews the 
third major branch oppose ordination of women or homosexuals as 
forbidden by jewish law 
rabbi daniel syme national vice president of the union of 
american hebrew congregations said i view this resolution as an 
important baseline document that will serve as a basis for change 
in the jewish community as a whole 
the union which last fall overwhelmingly approved a similar 
document represents the 13 million members of us reform 
congregations there are another 100000 to 200000 reform jews 
worldwide 
the central conference which places rabbis with congregations 
warned gay and lesbian rabbis that their jobs could be endangered 
if they make their sexual orientation known and called for 
education and dialogue to encourage acceptance

about 400 inmates rioted at the states 
minimum security prison monday looting and setting two buildings 
ablaze and ripping doors off hinges a guard was injured by a 
thrown rock authorities said 
the disturbance at the carl robinson correctional institution 
started about 715 am when the inmates refused to return to their 
dormitories after breakfast to protest the food and low wages for 
their prison jobs said correction department spokesman william 
wheeler 
the inmates threw rocks broke windows and broke into the two 
buildings which housed mess halls a commissary and a gymnasium 
wheeler said 
the inmates looted the commissary and torched both buildings 
which were reduced to rubble wheeler estimated the damage at 27 
million 
about 250 correction officers including scores brought in from 
other state prisons used tear gas to quell the riot 
most of the inmates were returned to their dormitories by 1230 
pm and warden george bronson said preliminary checks showed all 
1356 inmates accounted for 
the perimeter security was maintained throughout the entire 
incident bronson said the correction officers were in 
control the inmates were in the yard 
he said the riot instigators would be charged 
a guard suffered a broken ankle from a rock thrown by an inmate 
wheeler said and a number of inmates complained of injuries like 
smoke inhalation and cuts and bruises 
about 100 state troopers equipped with riot gear and police dogs 
were brought in but remained on standby about a quarter mile away 
wheeler said 
wheeler said prison officials did not have advance warning of 
the riot but later received a flyer inmates had circulated calling 
for a strike monday several news organizations reported getting 
anonymous calls sunday and monday about a planned strike 
a woman who identified herself only as an inmates wife 
telephoned the journal inquirer newspaper in manchester monday 
morning and said the prisoners were undertaking a food strike 
reading from an inmate letter she said food quality was 
substandard the mess hall unsanitary and the diet lacking in fruit 
we realize were not at the holiday inn but we are human 
beings its been proven that individuals treated as animals will 
return to society as animals she read 
the prisons population has nearly doubled in the last three 
months and tensions have mounted bronson said additional guards 
have been hired but acknowledged the 250member staff had not 
doubled 
the prison opened in 1987 was designed to accommodate 1360 
the prison was plagued by escapes last year prompting 
authorities to spend 1 million on an electronic fence topped with 
razor wire still three inmates escaped earlier this month two 
remain at large

have to turn out their three nieces

nieces who moved in several months ago the nieces parents are 
unemployed and homeless

probate court judge robert martin on monday that the state 
department of social service is expected to rule soon on the

after six days of peace talks 
salvadoran government and guerrilla negotiators have made progress 
but no concrete advances in talks on the militarys future role a 
un mediator announced monday 
alvaro desoto a representative of un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar told journalists the negotiators have moved on to 
the second item on their sevenpoint agenda human rights before 
concluding their round of dialogue at this resort 40 miles south of 
mexico city 
desoto said movement to the next subject meant that for the 
moment possibility for concrete advance on the first item the 
armed forces was exhausted 
he said negotiators would return to the subject of armed forces 
in future sessions 
both sides are conscious of the difficulty of the subjects of 
negotiation especially the first subject accords have not yet 
been achieved but there has been movement in that direction 
that has no precedence in the history of contact between the 
government and the fmln said the un communique 
the initials stand for the farabundo marti national liberation 
front the leftist insurgent army that has waged civil war against 
a succession of usbacked governments 
the civil war has left about 72000 people most of them 
civilians dead 
the talks were the second round in a dialogue begun last month 
in caracas venezuela 
the military retains a strong degree of power in el salvadors 
government and international rights organizations have blamed the 
armed forces for the torture and murder of thousands of suspected 
opponents no military officer has ever been convicted or even 
tried for rights violations 
salvadoran justice minister oscar santamaria chief of the 
government delegation told the associated press the session was 
successful but like desoto declined to elaborate 
miguel saenz a member of the guerrilla delegation said in 
general were encouraged by the results 
guerrilla negotiator salvador samayoa said it is the old 
question of whether the glass is halfempty or halffull i prefer 
to see it halffull and not because of mere optimism but because 
conditions favor movement toward peace 
the seven topics to be discussed in the accords are the role of 
the armed forces human rights judicial and electoral reform 
constitutional revision socioeconomic problems and international 
verification of compliance with the agreements 
the two sides agreed to meet again july 20 the communique did 
not say where but participants said it would be in costa rica 
four rounds of dialogue from 1984 to 1989 failed to produce 
progress and talks broke down over mutual charges of intransigence

chinas decision to permit dissident 
astrophysicist fang lizhi to leave his country after a year behind 
the sheltering walls of the us embassy is a farsighted 
significant step to improved uschinese relations the white 
house said monday 
we think its one step an encouraging step in the process 
said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater it would hopefully 
indicate a desire for better relations with the west 
fitzwater acknowledged that as part of the process that led to 
his release fang did make a commitment not to oppose the 
policies of chinas communist rulers 
however the spokesman said president bush made no commitment 
granted no quid pro quo of any kind in exchange for the 
chinese scholars freedom 
the united state remains strongly critical of continuing 
human rights abuses by the chinese government fitzwater said 
fang and his wife li shuxian left china for britain late 
sunday after communist authorities allowed them to end their 
sojourn in the us embassy he has accepted a position at 
cambridge university 
the united states government welcomes the peoples republic of 
chinas decision to facilitate the departure of dr fang and his 
wife fitzwater said in a formal statement which he said was 
issued with the knowledge of the chinese foreign ministry 
this humanitarian action is a farsighted significant step 
that will improve the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral 
relations the statement said 
richard solomon assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs was quoted by hearst news service as saying a 
heart attack fang suffered last month was the face saver that 
permitted the chinese government to cite humanitarian concerns 
in permitting him to leave 
a specialist flown to the embassy treated fang after concluded 
that he would be arrested if he went to a beijing hospital solomon 
said 
solomon said both governments had agreed to refrain from direct 
reference to the heart attack saying only that fang needed medical 
treatment 
fang was a symbol of the crisis in relations between washington 
and beijing in the aftermath of the chinese violent crackdown on 
pro democracy demonstrations in tiananmen square last june 
the official chinese news agency xinhua said fang and his wife 
were allowed to leave the country for medical reasons after showing 
signs of repentance 
but fitzwater said he believed fangs statement merely 
paralleled many of his public statements in the past 
china had previously said that to be released fang and li would 
have to confess guilt and promise not to carry out any 
antigovernment activities 
president bush has agreed to extend preferential trade and 
tariff status for china pending approval by congress 
fitzwater said chinese embassy officials here are clearly aware 
of widespread reluctance on capitol hill to approve continued most 
favored nation trade status for china

house and senate conferees on monday deleted 
from a civil rights bill language that would have allowed employers 
to move aids sufferers away from foodhandling jobs 
the action came as representatives of each chamber discussed 
changes made on the respective floors in the landmark civil rights 
legislation aimed at ensuring the rights of some 43 million 
disabled 
earlier this month the senate had accepted a houseadded 
provision placing the limitation on work assignments of aids 
sufferers a move that was seen at the time as a major victory for 
sen jesse helms rnc 
but sponsors of the legislation including sen david 
durenberger rminn edward m kennedy dmass and thomas 
harkin diowa argued that no such restrictive language was 
necessary they said it could not be justified in view of existing 
scientific evidence indicating that the aids virus is not 
transmitted through such casual means as the preparation and 
handling of food 
kennedy said in a statement later that he was happy the 
conferees turned back the foodhandlers amendment 
this amendment flies in the face of all scientific and medical 
evidence and is a step backwards in our public understanding of and 
compassion for this nations aids crisis he said 
the senate by voice vote on june 6 had approved a nonbinding 
motion by helms to have the americans with disabilities act include 
an exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected 
workers from foodhandling jobs 
helms motion instructed senate negotiators to accept a 
houseadopted exemption when they worked out a final version of the 
bill 
but the socalled chapman amendment named for rep james 
chapman dtexas was deleted from the bill during mondays 
conference committee work 
harkin had said earlier that the amendment would codify 
ignorance about aids and how it is transmitted 
the house had approved the exemption 199187 last month before 
it finally passed the entire act 40320 the senate passed the bill 
768 last september 
the conference report is expected to go first to thesenate 
possibly as early as wednesday and then to the house and sponsors 
said they expected final congressional passage before a fourth of 
july recess 
the house had adopted the amendment even though health and human 
services secretary louis w sullivan said it was unnecessary the 
white house had not spoken out against the amendment however 
although it specifically endorsed another unrelated change 
it was endorsed by the restaurant and foodservice industry as 
well as by the national federation of independent business a chief 
critic of the entire disabilities bill

the governor warned lawmakers monday they 
will have to change the state constitution to give rural residents 
the first crack at game and fish if they want to avoid federal 
control of the states wildlife 
the legislature was convened in special session at gov steve 
cowpers request to consider a constitutional amendment to bring 
the state back into compliance with federal subsistence law 
the alaska supreme court in december declared part of a state 
law giving rural alaskans preferential rights to subsistence 
hunting and fishing unconstitutional saying it discriminated 
against urban hunters and fishermen 
because of that ruling which put state and federal laws at 
odds the federal government plans to assume responsibility for 
game management sunday in the twothirds of the state it owns 
to regain state control an amendment must pass both houses of 
the legislature by a twothirds margin and be put to the voters 
the soonest date for a vote is the nov 6 general election 
cowper a democrat and us sen ted stevens ralaska both 
support the amendment 
there are sound reasons based on our history as a territory 
and as a state for us to do whatever is necessary to maintain the 
opportunity for rural alaskan residents to live off the land and 
to keep the power to manage our fish and wildlife for ourselves 
cowper said 
an estimated 110000 alaskans venture into the wild to hunt 
fish and gather plants for food 
five federal land agencies plan to assume game management of 
alaskas federal land to protect the rural subsistence right which 
is grounded in a 1980 federal law management of fisheries will 
remain under state control 
the takeover is expected to produce confusion among hunters 
faced with differing regulations on alaskas patchwork of public 
lands 
stevens said alaskans control over their future will be lost if 
the federal takeover is allowed to become permanent 
the proposed federal subsistence regulations are bad for 
alaska and they will inevitably get worse stevens said 
antihunting groups are a strong force in washington dc and 
they will continuously lobby federal agencies to reduce hunting 
opportunities in alaska 
said cowper go to an animalrights meeting on the east coast 
and see if you identify with the views expressed there

the supreme court made it significantly more 
difficult monday for girls to obtain legal abortions without first 
notifying their parents 
the court voted 63 to uphold an ohio law that bans abortions 
for unmarried girls under 18 who are dependent on one or both 
parents unless a parent is notified or a judges approval is 
obtained 
and the court voted 54 to allow minnesota to require 
notification of both parents as long as girls can avoid telling 
either parent by getting a judges permission instead 
by a separate 54 vote the justices struck down a provision in 
the same minnesota law that would have required twoparent 
notification with no judicial bypass option 
abortion rights advocates and antiabortion forces agreed that 
the two decisions heightened the possibility the high court soon 
would reverse its 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
but nothing in the two decisions which featured nine separate 
opinions and shifting coalitions among the justices affected 
directly adult womens right to abortion 
the decisions practical potential impact is enormous of the 
15 million legal abortions performed annually in the united states 
since 1973 about 12 percent some 180000 a year have been for 
minors 
the two decisions offer these guidelines for such 
parentalnotification laws 
states may require that both parents be notified only if a 
judicial bypass option is included 
even requiring notice to one parent must be accompanied by an 
alternative that allows a girl to avoid telling her parent if she 
can prove to a judge it would be against her best interest 
the girl may be required to prove by clear and convincing 
evidence not by just a preponderance of the evidence that she 
is mature enough to make the decision on her own 
doctors personally may be required to notify the parents 
states may require that parental notice occur at least 48 hours 
before an abortion is performed 
these decisions bode ill for the future of reproductive choice 
in america said melanne verveer of people for the american way 
a proabortion rights group with justice sandra day oconnor 
creating the antichoice majority today we now have a supreme 
court ready and willing to give the green light to states weighing 
curbs on choice 
oconnor provided the key fifth vote for upholding that version 
of the minnesota law featuring a judicial bypass option 
the court last july gave states greater power to regulate 
abortions four members then appeared ready to reverse roe vs wade 
and allow states to ban virtually all abortions 
oconnor refused to go that far but again monday indicated she 
would be willing to uphold any abortion regulations that do not 
present an undue burden on women 
since joining the court in 1981 oconnor has only found one 
such regulation to be an undue burden the minnesota provision 
requiring twoparent notification without a judicial bypass option 
these decisions coupled with last julys ruling are very 
chilling said faye wattleton president of planned parenthood 
todays decisions are a defeat for young women and ultimately for 
all women 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league called the decisions quite alarming 
as if allowing states to treat teens like criminals were not 
enough justice oconnor once again signaled her willingness to 
overturn roe vs wade she said 
praising the decisions annlouise lohr of americans united for 
life called them big victories for parents rights and for the 
rights of minors to have their parents involved in personal 
decisions 
a jubilant beverly lahaye president of concerned women for 
america added minor daughters should not be excluded from 
receiving the input of their parents in this critical 
lifechanging experience she said 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the two decisions 
indicate clearly the court holds to its view there is a degree of 
flexibility states can utilize in regulating abortion but that 
there are still constitutional limits the court tends to observe 
and impose 
the justices previously had allowed limits on the availability 
of abortions for minors for example the court in 1979 said states 
may require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain parental consent 
to an abortion so long as a judicial bypass option is provided 
twentytwo states have enacted such parentalconsent laws ten 
states have enacted parentalnotification laws similar to those 
ruled on monday 
voting to uphold the ohio law were oconnor chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices john paul stevens byron r 
white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices william j brennan harry a blackmun and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
voting to uphold the minnesota provision that includes the 
judicial bypass option were oconnor rehnquist white scalia and 
kennedy dissenting were stevens brennan marshall and blackmun 
voting to strike down the minnesota provision that would have 
excluded the judicial bypass were oconnor stevens brennan 
blackmun and marshall dissenting were rehnquist white scalia and 
kennedy

previous record of 118 degrees was recorded on four dates most 
recently july 4 1989 tucson broke its record for the date with

on phoenixs hottest day ever monday the 
question was whether to suffer in a stifling car or turn on the 
airconditioning and risk getting stranded on a roadside with the 
temperature at 120 degrees 
phoenixs previous record of 118 degrees was hit most recently 
last july 4 the arizona automobile associations phoenix office 
took at least 1500 calls easily a third more than normal said 
frank kuczora of the road service department he said the extras 
were mostly overheatings and dead batteries 
people apparently fared better than their cars the fire 
department reported just a few more heatrelated calls 
the ringling bros and barnum amp bailey circus arrived and 
promptly set up 55gallon water barrels so its elephants could hose 
down 
despite the heat utility spokesmen werent expecting new 
records in electricity usage the humidity was low so many 
customers probably were trying to get by with evaporative coolers 
which eat less power than air conditioners said jeff eldot a salt 
river project spokesman 
the extreme heat came from a combination of a high pressure 
systems warm air and the suns high summer angle said craig 
ellis a national weather service metereologist

a bomb exploded monday evening in a conservative 
party social club in downtown london injuring nine people 
including one seriously authorities said 
the victims of the blast at the carlton club included an 
82yearold member of the house of lords the lawmakers wife said 
two american tourists also suffered minor cuts from flying glass 
the bomb containing 10 to 15 pounds of high explosives was 
planted just inside the door of the 158yearold club said george 
churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist squad 
the club has long been considered one of the most venerable symbols 
of british establishment 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion 
fell on the irish republican army which has been waging a new 
terror campaign to end british rule in northern ireland 
it brings a new dimension to the campaign and i must warn the 
public in general that these people are determined to cause injury 
and maim said churchillcoleman clearly alluding to the ira 
everyone must be on their guard 
the bombers struck at one of the most popular meeting places for 
cabinet ministers lawmakers and other members of the governing 
conservative party 
prime minister margaret thatcher the only female member of the 
mens club called the attack one more outrage in a catalog of 
terrorist inhumanity 
whoever is responsible stands condemned of total and callous 
disregard for human life both within the club and among 
passersby she said in dublin ireland where she was attending 
a european community summit these people are prepared to bomb 
and maim others indiscriminately for their own perverted 
satisfaction 
it was the worst attack on a conservative party target since 
1984 when an ira bomb narrowly missed mrs thatcher in the hotel 
in the seaside resort of brighton where she was staying for a party 
convention five people died in the blast 
the explosion occurred at 840 pm 340 pm edt on the 
ground floor of the threestory club which is near trafalgar 
square and a few hundred yards from buckingham palace 
it was not known how many people were inside at the time of the 
blast the fire brigade said it rescued 24 people from the building 
i heard an enormous explosion said ian greener night 
manager at neighboring brookss club we dashed outside and all 
the smoke was coming from the building onto the street so it 
obviously was not a car bomb 
police said one person was seriously wounded scotland yard 
identified him as a porter working near the clubs entrance 
eight other people suffered lesser injuries 
authorities identified none of the casualties but lady kaberry 
said her husband lord kaberry was injured his condition was not 
known kaberry is a former vice chairman of the conservative party 
this is terribly shocking these people who do these things 
are taking shots in the dark lady kaberry said it is everyone 
who has to live in fear now not only the army but civilians and 
politicians 
also injured were two other staff members an unidentified man 
and two policemen who were treated for smoke inhalation 
st thomass hospital said it discharged two americans jane 
kahan 49 and jacob boaltefhuva 61 both of new york after 
treating them for cuts from flying glass 
kahan said she was coming out of christies auction house when 
she heard a terrible crash and looked up and saw a window had 
blown out of the building nearby 
some of the fragments of glass hit me i was in no doubt that 
it was a bomb 
the area is in a crowded tourist site 
i am horrified this is the mecca of the conservative party 
that is why the terrorists have chosen to attack it said sir 
john stokes a conservative lawmaker 
chauffeur tim parrington 30 was waiting in a rollsroyce on 
the street outside the carlton when there was a deafening bang 
and then the shock waves hit the car and it started rocking 
i went outside to see and there was smoke billowing from the 
windows and the curtains were blowing about the people seemed to 
be walking out quite orderly 
other witnesses said they saw two waiters stumble outside in a 
daze their aprons blackened 
two art dealers who were at a reception near the club said that 
just after the explosion they saw four men carrying athletic bags 
jump into a car make a uturn and drive away the men appeared 
nervous the witnesses said 
the carlton nestled among the establishment watering holes 
known collectively as clubland is a favorite haunt of conservative 
party lawmakers and therefore a likely target for the ira in its 
campaign to drive britain out of northern ireland 
founded in 1832 it is an exclusively male club but it had to 
waive that rule in 1979 to admit mrs thatcher when she became 
prime minister 
it moved into its present building after its original home was 
bombed in world war ii

fang lizhi chinas bestknown dissident ended 
his yearlong refuge in the us embassy on monday and flew to 
britain after the government freed him in an effort to improve ties 
with the west 
the white house hailed beijings move as a humanitarian 
action that will improve uschinese relations 
fang and his wife li shuxian also a wellknown dissident flew 
from beijing to london aboard a us air force transport jet they 
landed at upper heyford a us air force base 60 miles west of 
london at 830 pm edt 
the couple had sought refuge in the embassy after the june 4 
1989 military crackdown on chinas prodemocracy movement 
the official xinhua news agency said they were given permission 
to leave the country for medical reasons after showing signs of 
repentance 
it said the move was in line with chinas policy of leniency 
toward those who participated in the disturbances of last june 
the us and chinese governments refused comment on fangs 
health condition 
but richard solomon assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs was quoted by hearst news service as saying a 
heart attack fang suffered last month was the facesaver that 
permitted the chinese government to cite humanitarian concerns 
in permitting him to leave 
a specialist flown to the embassy treated fang because he 
feared he would be arrested if he went to a beijing hospital 
solomon said 
the public security ministry said the couple was given lenient 
treatment after they admitted in a writing to having violated the 
constitution by opposing socialist principles and the leadership of 
the communist party 
in washington the state department issued a statement by fang 
and li in which the two said they remain opposed to four cardinal 
principles of the chinese constitution because their purpose is 
to uphold a political system of class struggle 
the two dissidents also said their purpose in going abroad is 
focused on scholarly exchange and research 
we will appreciate and welcome all activities which accord 
with the progressive interests of chinese society they said 
and moreover refuse to participate in all contrary activities 
whose motive lies in opposing china 
chinas decision to allow the couple to leave eliminated a major 
obstacle to bettering chinaus relations they deteriorated badly 
after the violent crackdown on prodemocracy protesters and their 
supporters which left hundreds and perhaps thousands dead 
the move clearly was intended to bolster chinas international 
standing at a critical time 
the us congress is debating president bushs decision to 
extend chinas mostfavorednation trade status which gives china 
lower tariffs on goods sold in the united states some members of 
congress have said china should lose the status because of its 
human rights record including the fang case 
also the seven industrialized nations are to hold their annual 
summit in july to discuss policies that include withholding 
government loans to china 
japans vice foreign minister takakazu kuriyama said the release 
created a favorable environment for reopening talks on the loan 
program 
japan had pledged a 52 billion fiveyear loan program to 
china but the plan was frozen after the bloody suppression of 
prodemocracy protesters 
on capitol hill monday senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
used fangs release to claim victory for bushs muchcriticized 
china policy 
it is a small but significant step toward the path that we 
want china to take the path of reason and the path of reform 
dole said it is also one bit of tangible evidence that president 
bush is on the right track in the way he is managing uschinese 
relations 
china has made several gestures recently toward repairing its 
image abroad since december the government has released nearly 
900 people arrested for taking part in the prodemocracy movement 
and it lifted martial law in beijing and in the tibetan capital of 
lhasa 
fang a 54yearold astrophysicist has been chinas most vocal 
and eloquent dissident since late 1986 when he supported student 
prodemocracy protests that winter 
the government claiming his speeches incited students to 
protest expelled fang from the communist party and fired him from 
his post as vice president of a major university but fang 
protected in part by his growing international renown continued to 
openly criticize the government and the socialist system 
until he and his wife fled to the us embassy fang spoke 
publicly both here and abroad about the necessity of political 
reform in china 
he pointedly avoided playing an active role in last years 
sevenweek movement even so the government accused fang and his 
wife a physicist of instigating the unrest they were charged 
with counterrevolutionary activities and placed on chinas 
mostwanted list 
fangs flight to the us embassy hurt his popularity among many 
chinese who said he and others who fled were unwilling to endure 
the crackdown with their countrymen 
in london on monday the foreign office said fang and li had 
been granted standard sixmonth tourist visas but declined to 
explain why the couple was going to britain rather than the us 
the foreign office spokesman said fang had received an 
invitation from the royal society britains oldest and most 
prestigious scientific organization fitzwater said fang had 
accepted a job as a professor at cambridge university 
fang is famous for his research in cosmology and blackhole 
physics he pioneered laser research in china

nelson mandela defended the use of violence to 
free south africa from whiteminority rule but told president bush 
on monday that force would not be used as long as pretorias 
government negotiates in good faith with the black majority 
if we are forced to resort to violence mandela said it 
is because we had no other alternative whatsoever 
bush assured the black revolutionary leader he was not about to 
lift us sanctions against the south african government but said 
all sides in the struggle should renounce violence armed struggle 
and repression 
in the words of the great martin luther king jr let us not 
seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of 
bitterness and hatred bush said 
the president welcomed mandela at a sunsplashed ceremony on the 
south lawn amid applause and cheers from a crowd of several 
hundred as mandela waved his wife winnie gave a clenchedfist 
salute 
bush and mandela met for three hours assistant secretary of 
state herman cohen said afterward mandela had pledged to suspend 
hostilities if the white government in pretoria clears the way for 
negotiations 
the president encouraged him to go beyond that to renounce 
the armed struggle cohen said mandela deputy president of the 
oncebanned african national congress did not make a commitment 
but said he would consider that step the official said 
mandela at a news conference said he had told bush the anc had 
scaled down its military operations in 1986 in order to promote 
negotiations 
we made it clear that once the government removed all the 
obstacles to negotiation we would consider the cessation of 
hostilities mandela said when we explained our position on 
this point president bush appeared to understand our position 
he said that to get negotiations going the south african 
government must release 1000 political prisoners return 20000 
political exiles eventually repeal repressive legislation and 
lift the state of emergency in the natal province we are hopeful 
that in our next meeting these obstacles will be completely 
removed with the exception of the legislation repeal mandela 
said 
welcoming mandela to the white house bush saluted the tide of 
democracy in eastern europe and said so too south africas 
time will come 
after tumultuous receptions for mandela earlier in new york and 
boston the white house meeting was the beginning of two days of 
bargaining with political leaders to keep the pressure on south 
africa to abolish apartheid the system under which 5 million 
whites subjugate 28 million blacks 
mandela met later monday with secretary of state james a baker 
iii and as he arrived at the state department he was greeted by 
cheers from about 1000 people there were also boos and jeers from 
a small group of people protesting violence by mandelas group in 
south africa 
the protesters were organized by a conservative group the 
national center for public policy research our complaint is that 
the anc is using violence said amy moritz president of the 
center 
leaving the department mandela praised bush as a man with a 
head and a heart and i exploited that he said he thought his 
gap with bush had been narrowed considerably and i think we more 
or less see the problems from the same angle 
at aflcio headquarters where he was met by scores of employes 
packed into the lobby mandela said violence was no longer really 
an issue 
mandela said he was honored to be greeted by people with an 
established record of committment to the struggle against 
apartheid and called on american unions to help by sharing their 
expertise with black trade unionists in south africa 
aflcio president lane kirkland said blacks in south africa 
can continue to count on our unwavering support until apartheid 
is ended 
at a dinner for mandela in the ornate caucus room of the russell 
senate office building attended by about 40 of the 100 senators as 
well as prominent black figures in the washington area senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine told mandela we will 
heed you call to keep sanctions in effect until apartheid is 
demolished

i am so deeply touched by what has been said here that i find 
it difficult to express my gratidude to the senators mandela 
said 
in a postapartheid south africa he said the african national 
congress wanted economic equality for all but would not 
necessarily follow a strict socialist model 
mandela will address a joint session of congress on tuesday 
mandela listened impassively as bush praised south african 
president fw de klerk for reforms to expand the rights and 
freedoms of all south africans 
bush said all parties must seize the opportunity to move 
ahead in a spirit of compromise and tolerance flexibility and 
patience and from all parties we look for a clear and unequivocal 
commitment to negotiations leading to peaceful change 
politely differing with the president mandela said bush has 
not as yet got a proper briefing from us bush smiled at the 
comment 
mandela left the white house saying he was very much 
encouraged by support from bush he said they discussed a variety 
of issues and reached broad agreement on almost all of them 
he said that in areas where they had disagreed they had 
narrowed the gaps 
bush and mandela agreed to disagree on us aid to noncommunist 
guerrillas in angola as well as mandelas support for palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat and for cubas fidel 
castro cohen said 
mandela asked for money for the african national congress but 
bush said no funds would go directly to any political organization 
cohen said he said the anc would benefit indirectly from funds 
channeled through a quasigovernment organization the fund for 
democracy 
on capitol hill a leading congressional supporter of mandela 
lamented that he has been so insistent in praising leaders of cuba 
libya and the plo 
i wish he had not said those things very frankly said rep 
howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on africa they were not helpful 
another supporter of sanctions rep larry smith dfla said 
he would boycott tuesdays speech 
and republican rep william dannemeyer of california said that 
because of mandelas violent past it was a national disgrace 
that he was invited to address congress 
in his opening statement monday mandela said that as long as 
south africas government is prepared to talk there can be no 
question of violence whatsoever 
but when a government decides to ban political organizations 
of the oppressed intensifies oppression and does not allow any 
free political activity no matter how peaceful and nonviolent 
then the people have no alternative but to resort to violence 
mandela said 
mandela jailed for 27 years until his release feb 11 said his 
african national congress has a total commitment to peace if we 
are forced to resort to violence it is because we have no other 
alternative whatsoever 
he said he would ask bush to keep sanctions in place because 
it is of sanctions that such enormous progress has been made in the 
attempt to address the problems of our country 
the administration says south africa is close to meeting the 
conditions under which it would consider asking congress to relax 
or lift the sanctions officials have said that once south africa 
releases its remaining political prisoners the administration 
would be in a position to review the sanctions 
our sanctions have been designed to support change and when 
the conditions laid down in our law have been met then and only 
then we will consider in consultation with the congress whether 
a change in course will promote further progress through peaceful 
negotiations bush said 
mandela thanked the united states for supporting the struggle 
against apartheid 
to receive the support of any government is in our situation 
something of enormous importance mandela said but to receive 
the support of the government of the united states of america the 
leader of the west is something beyond words

european community leaders monday 
rejected a french and west german proposal for a 15billion aid 
package to the soviet union and instead ordered a study of that 
countrys economic needs officials reported 
officials of all the major community nations reported there was 
unanimous agreement on a general desire to help the soviet union 
but the view pressed by britain and denmark that largescale 
handouts were not the right approach appeared to have prevailed 
a senior west german official speaking after the 12 leaders 
debated the issue late into the night said he expected an aid 
package to be decided by the end of the year 
i think that there is a majority for providing help to the 
soviet union the official said speaking on condition of 
anonmyity but he acknowledged that no figure will be cited 
when the community leaders end their twoday summit tuesday 
a british official told reporters the important thing is to 
establish what might be required and how best this might be met 
british officials said they would seek to engage the united 
states and japan in the study at the july summit of the seven major 
industrialized nations in houston 
a british official said prime minister margaret thatcher had 
argued that 15 billion would be ineffective in a country of 250 
million people with no clear idea of where the money would go 
that gave people real pause for thought said the official 
there is no point in giving that kind of money if you dont know 
what you are giving it for and what is the objective 
the communitys executive commission will undertake the study 
officials said 
the issue of aid to the soviet union dominated the summit after 
kohl and mitterrand declared friday that largescale economic aid 
was urgent to help president mikhail s gorbachev bail out his 
stricken economy 
kohl wrote to the other 11 leaders last week urging them to come 
up with economic aid at the summit he also took his own initiative 
in guaranteeing 31billion in west german bank loans 
in the letter obtained monday from diplomats in dublin kohl 
also made it clear he saw the aid partly as a tradeoff to getting 
gorbachev to drop his objections to a united germany belonging to 
nato and the european community 
a sign of the changes sweeping europe was the presence of east 
german prime minister lothar de maiziere who became the first 
eastern european leader to attend a european community summit 
at a news conference late monday de maiziere called his 
participation at the ec summit a great honor 
we consider this an important sign a hand reached out to 
us de maiziere said 
he said east germany was open to all west european partners 
and didnt want only to attract west german investments he added 
that east germany also had a duty to cultivate and preserve its 
relations with the rest of eastern europe 
the community foreign ministers at a separate dinner reached 
no agreement on whether to commit to easing sanctions if south 
african president fw de klerk continues his reform program 
officials said the heads of government will tackle this again 
tuesday 
earlier community officials announced the european leaders had 
agreed to start a conference on political union dec 14 those 
talks will run parallel to talks on economic and monetary union 
beginning dec 15 
today we entered into a decisive phase in the construction of 
europe frances foreign minister roland dumas told reporters 
thatcher went along with the agreement despite her opposition 
to the proposal for economic union that calls for a single european 
currency and central bank 
british officials quoted her as saying a single currency would 
rob member states of fundamental control over their economies 
britain is expected to suggest a compromise setting up a new 
currency to circulate alongside existing currencies for perhaps 
another 20 years 
the agreement to hold the december conferences had been widely 
expected after britain said it would not try to block it 
on south african sanctions britain said it would not press for 
bans on imports of south african iron steel and gold coins 
jointly imposed by the community in 1986 to be lifted now 
some obsevers regarded this as tacit acknowledgement that mrs 
thatcher would have a tough time getting a decision while black 
leader nelson mandela is in the united states pressing for 
sanctions to be maintained until apartheid is abolished

but the cost may be high 
it probably means higher inflation interest rates and taxes in 
the west and business failures lost jobs and higher prices in the 
east how much of each remains a question 
the economic merger takes place july 1 when the west german 
mark becomes east germanys currency and east germany abandons its 
communist economics for western capitalism 
the union will enlarge west germanys economy by an estimated 5 
to 10 percent but few statistics are available on the east german 
economy

surrogate a singer named maggie also dies of an overdose this 
traumatizes the plays main character the liberal jewish lawyer 
quentin whom some saw as millers alter ego 
in london james laurenson who is white plays quentin whose 
private anguish is linked to the larger historical atrocities of 
mccarthyism and especially the holocaust 
josette simon a black actress from leicester in the english 
midlands plays quentins doomed wife maggie in a casting coup 
that she and blakemore hope will freshly illuminate the play 
i wanted to rob the play of its associations with marilyn 
the 62yearold blakemore said of his decision to cast simon the 
willowy actress best known for her role as dr ramphele in the 
celebrated richard attenborough film cry freedom 
all other productions sink in a welter of celebrity 
speculation said blakemore they just get wrapped up in the 
gossip was this really what the marriage is like did he really do 
that its unfair 
blakemore said the impact of the play has immensely increased 
with simon in the role instead of the usual kittenish blonde 
the sexual charge between them is like othello he said 
i was delighted in that it gave one of the most amazing young 
actresses ive worked with in a long time a major chance 
arthur miller who will be 75 in october told the sunday 
telegraph newspaper that he approved the idea providing she 
simon had the talent 
in an interview with the associated press early this year he 
said he had hoped enough time has gone by so that people can see 
what the theme of the play is rather than the scandal maybe now 
they can judge the play as a play 
josette simon who is in her 30s said of her casting i 
didnt want it to be any kind of theatrical device or novelty 
thing it had to work as a character 
were not overtly saying maggie is black what it means is 
that one can look to the humanity of the character and see that 
shes about more than just donning a wig and playing monroe 
no rewrites were required 
i wouldnt have done it if that had been the case blakemore 
said arthur and i have been through the text and we have made 
certain cuts certain tiny alterations but these are no more or 
less than one would do in any production 
after the fall has sold out its run in the cottesloe which 
has flexible seating for up to 400 it moves sept 27 to the 
nationals 890seat lyttelton and plays through dec 29 
its one of two miller plays currently in the national 
repertory his 1953 the crucible opened may 31 to 
mixedtofavorable reviews in the 1160seat olivier auditorium 
blakemore said he wanted this production to reawaken interest in 
a play that has been misjudged for over 20 years its origins 
in millers own life are says its director honestly earned 
at the end of the day your own life is the only touchstone 
you really have said blakemore who has two hit shows now on 
broadway lettice and lovage and city of angels and hopes 
to take after the fall on to new york 
i mean all writers write about the people they know he 
said and then transform them into something into something 
else

in the flag flap one cliche of choice is the 
observation that free speech does not protect somebody who shouts 
fire in a crowded theater 
another is the warning that to amend the bill of rights would 
set the government on a slippery slope toward censoring dissent 
one is pro one is con both were uttered again and again as the 
house debated and rejected a constitutional amendment against flag 
desecration the lines will get another workout in the senate this 
week after a full year of political argument there isnt anything 
to be said that hasnt been said before more than once 
for the record the crowded theater argument is a slightly 
amended version of a 1919 observation by justice oliver wendell 
holmes jr 
the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect 
a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic 
holmes held advocates of the constitutional amendment president 
bush among them cited that argument in varied versions to contend 
that there are limits to free speech and that one of them should 
ban flag burning 
the other side the winning side said any tinkering with the 
first amendment would erode freedoms too precious to put at risk 
and make it easier to act against the next set of unpopular 
dissenters they said an amendment now could lead to such a skid 
toward censorship later 
i also went to law school and i know all about the sleight of 
hand slippery slope arguments like this one said sen robert 
dole rkans the minority leader who advocates the amendment he 
said he didnt buy the argument as a law student and doesnt buy it 
now 
rep robert h michel rill the house gop leader complained 
that opponents tell us our amendment is a foot in the door or a 
slippery slope and all the other cliches they can think of 
deja vu 
for all the hours of talk the flag debate hasnt produced major 
league cliches maybe thats because nobody figured out a way to 
quote yogi berra on this one the hall of fame yankee catcher 
later a manager now a senior baseball advisor to the houston 
astros is being quoted by politicians on most everything else 
budget taxes arms control negotiations trade talks berras 
sometimes fractured adages are turning up regularly 
it was like what yogi berra said deja vu all over again 
president bush said a while back when he visited his old 
republican headquarters 
in a more scholarly mode arms negotiator richard burt wrote 
early this month that yogi berras phrasedeja vu all over 
again best describes the current controversy surrounding the 
strategic arms reduction talks 
like yogi berra said when you reach the crossroads take 
it rep leon e panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the other day in urging that the budget 
negotiations get rolling toward a solution 
its never over as yogi berra said until its over a 
republican congressman from illinois observed as he promised to 
keep pushing for more federal funds for a project back in his 
district 
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher sending an aide to check 
on south korean trade practices reminded him of berras counsel 
you can observe a lot just by watching 
a soviet affairs exprt said almost anything could happen in the 
political upheavals there to quote yogi berra said michael 
mandelbaum of the council on foreign relations all predictions 
are dangerous especially ones about the future he would have 
made a good sovietologist 
explaining his cautious policy toward moscow on lithuanian 
independence last spring president bush said i love the old 
expression of yogi berras you know what happened to the 
mets yogi 
he said well we made the wrong mistakes and i expect in 
this job ill make plenty of mistakes but i dont want to make the 
wrong mistakes 
the flag debate could have used some yogi

there was no shortage of advance publicity 
for the march debut of equal justice in abcs spring lineup 
the show about young struggling lawyers in a bigcity district 
attorneys office was a personal favorite of abc entertainment 
president robert iger before it ever hit prime time it had become 
one of the most talked about new programs on television 
that wasnt enough to make it one of the most watched 
equal justice was not picked up for the fall schedule 
instead it was renewed as a replacement series 
this is a big disappointment to thomas carter the shows 
executive producer and cocreator it leaves him in the unenviable 
spot of being in television purgatory it also illustrates the 
uncertainty of life in this business 
listen its a bad situation carter said in an interview 
last week but i would have been more disappointed if it didnt 
get picked up at all 
being picked up as a replacement series means that equal 
justice is a primetime understudy if a show bombs in the fall 
carters program could take its place that scenario presents its 
own catch22 
if we get thrown on the air well be in trouble because well 
be in a time slot where some other show has failed he said 
and well be in trouble because well be rushed onto the air 
carter 36 has been called one of the best directors in 
episodic television he is the hired gun who made the premiere 
episodes of acclaimed series such as miami vice st 
elsewhere a year in the life and midnight caller 
equal justice is his first effort at producing an entire 
series the program which airs its last original episode wednesday 
night at 10 edt never made the nielsen top 10 
well it never made the top 20 either but in the increasingly 
competitive battle for network viewers its ratings were considered 
respectable 
carter pushed hard for abc to bring equal justice back in 
the fall in the end though he lost to steven bochco the 
heavyhitter who helped create hill street blues and la 
law 
anytime steven gets up to the plate youve got to take that 
seriously carter said 
bochcos next at bat is cop rock a program that has police 
officers bursting into song and juries belting out verdicts like a 
revival meeting choir 
cop rock also is dear to iger when it came right down to 
it with only a limited number of open spots in the fall schedule 
cop rock was given the wednesday slot now occupied by equal 
justice 
we couldnt go on thursday night because nbc has la law 
and you cant have those two shows on the same night carter 
said tuesday is thirtysomething that leaves friday night and 
were not a friday night show and who wants to be on saturday i 
know i dont 
the chicago tribune called carters show la law with a 5 
oclock shadow hill street blues with neat suits and pretty 
dresses 
others were less charitable the characters are studiously 
eccentric and woefully unlikable said the boston globe another 
tv critic labeled it jurysomething 
carter admits he has a few kinks to work out the ensemble cast 
which numbers 10 is big and sometimes hard to like the 
prosecuting attorneys of this unnamed city are overworked 
undersexed and sometimes just plain mean to each other 
i dont think we showed the audience enough of who these 
people are carter said we kept them in the courtroom a lot 
but when the show begins production in august the cast will 
stay the same there are a lot of people and there still will be 
a lot going on 
the actors include joe morton star of the john sayles film 
brother from another planet sarah jessica parker from the 
shortlived tv series a year in the life and debrah farentino 
hooperman and the daytime soap capitol 
there is yet another catch to being a replacement show if 
nothing in the fall schedule warrants an immediate yank equal 
justice is guaranteed a spot on the spring schedule 
that means the short attention spans of television viewers must 
become familiar with the show all over again 
im worried about it carter said i dont want to lose our 
audience i think abc is really going to have to remind people of 
who we are and that were back 
we have a difficult job im not happy about the difficulty of 
it

editors note it was the battle that inspired winston 
churchill to say never in the field of human conflict was so 
much owed by so many to so few the battle of britain fought in 
the skies over southern england 50 years ago this summer handed 
adolf hitler his first setback of world war ii 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
the battle of britain historys greatest air 
battle gave the british nation its first closeup view of world 
war ii 
the public could watch enthralled and terrified as outnumbered 
hurricane and spitfire fighter planes scrambled from makeshift 
country airfields to take on fleets of german bombers and their 
fighter escorts thundering across the english channel from bases 
in newly conquered france 
wrecked planes littered fields and beaches of southern england 
others sank in the sea 
it was a desperate fight against the odds but after 114 days 
from july 10 to oct 31 the daylight bombing assaults were 
repelled and adolf hitler received his first shock of the war 
pat hancock then a 21yearold hurricane pilot recalls being 
very frightened but he knew what he was fighting for 
i knew the germans were coming he said meaning that he 
knew hitler intended to invade 
the royal air force lost 1023 planes and 537 flyers 106 of 
them from nine other countries including four us volunteers 31 
poles 18 canadians and 17 new zealanders 
the luftwaffe lost 2662 flyers and 1887 aircraft 
the raf pilots were mostly in their late teens or early 20s 
they were burned alive or blown apart by cannon shells 
they died in their parachutes drowned or were smashed to bits 
as their stricken aircraft fell to earth on places older than the 
domesday book ashford blean canterbury dover higham ruckinge 
seasalter sheppey tonbridge wye 
this summer the veterans are getting together for air displays 
exhibitions dances and on sept 15 a survivors parade in london 
with a 12mile column of veteran and modern aircraft flying over 
buckingham palace 
hancock who survived five crashes is 71 and secretary of the 
battle of britain fighter association 
in august 1940 he managed to get back to base after being shot 
up by a messerschmitt me109 fighter two weeks later he shot up a 
german heinkel 111 bomber 
later fighting in malta and north africa he won the 
distinguished flying cross 
the risk in all fighting was fire hancock recalls there 
were about 90 gallons of fuel almost in our laps and we were 
terrified of being burned 
waiting for orders on the airfield put us in a state of 
twitch you didnt know when the hut telephone rang if it was some 
pilots domestic problem or the controller ordering scramble 
james pickford then a 23yearold gunner in a twinengine 
blenheim bomber recalls we were young and i didnt realize that 
something considerable was taking place you didnt have time to be 
scared but you were always thankful to get back 
i didnt like takeoffs and i would say a prayer but once the 
wheels were up i was happy i slept between sheets and i had a good 
war 
everything hinged on air mastery and the luftwaffe was then the 
worlds largest air force it had helped crush poland in three 
weeks of 1939 and denmark norway the netherlands belgium 
luxembourg and france in less than three months of 1940 hitlers 
air chief hermann goering was confident it would destroy the raf 
clearing the way for the invasion of england 
the battle of britain shattered these hopes 
the daylight raids to knock out raf fighter command the 
airfields radar stations aircraft factories and docks were 
defeated and the luftwaffe turned to bombing british cities by 
night hitler had originally ordered an invasion for july 16 in 
october he abandoned the plan 
sir winston churchill the wartime prime minister gave the 
battle its name before it began saying on june 18 the battle of 
france is over i expect that the battle of britain is about to 
begin

the air battle put britain back in the war after the fall of 
france on june 14 and our retreat from dunkirk says historian 
ajp taylor 
the british were invigorated for the rest of the war and the 
rest of the world particularly the united states was shown that 
britain had to be taken seriously as a fighting power 
the brains behind the victory was air chief marshal sir hugh 
dowding a world war i aviator like goering but unlike his 
opponent keenly interested in technology 
although the outward impression was of a small poorly equipped 
british force fending off a vastly superior force the raf was in 
fact fairly well prepared with fighters although not bombers 
in the 1930s when air forces were still based on biplane 
fighters the british air ministry learned through its intelligence 
agents of hitlers buildup of his air force the british began to 
consider how to go to war 
a few industrialists designers and engineers were already 
working independently on faster monoplane fighters and when the 
ministry called for one hawkers quickly came up with the 
hurricane vickerssupermarine a bit later with the spitfire and 
rollsroyce with the merlin engine to power them both 
airplane factories were established before the war in several 
places and were able to tool up quickly for expanded production 
when the war began 
dowding had been certain that war was coming he defied the 
prevailing wisdom that the bomber would always get through with 
scientific help he developed the use of radar then a topsecret 
innovation to detect the approaching enemy 
he set up ground observer posts to report the enemys direction 
altitude and numbers and radio communications among his fighters 
dowding and his frontline commander in southeast england air 
vicemarshal keith park of new zealand deployed the fighters 
sparingly in small groups when the enemy was near instead of using 
them in standing patrols which would have worn out machines and men 
the raf had the advantage of fighting close to home and could 
salvage more men and machines than the enemy 
the sleek spitfire roughly matched the stumpy me109 while the 
rugged hurricane was slower but hurricanes outnumbered spitfires 
53 and shot down more aircraft than the rest of the raf and 
antiaircraft guns combined 
the me109s guns could deliver nearly twice as much metal in a 
threesecond burst as the british fighters but the germans did not 
give the fighters escorting their bombers extra fuel tanks so they 
had no more than 10 minutes of combat time if they reached london 
adolf galland the german ace said that was the main factor in 
their defeat having to break off combat and run for home 
the rafs top scorer was a czechoslovak hurricane pilot josef 
frantisek credited with 17 enemy planes shot down before he was 
killed in an accident in october 
battle of britain pilot james nicolson was the only fighter 
command man throughout world war ii to win the victoria cross 
britains highest honor for battlefield courage 
on aug 16 over southampton wounded and his hurricane aflame 
he was about to bail out when a messerschmitt appeared before him 
as flames peeled skin from his hands and face he fired a long 
burst he believes the german crashed in the sea 
nicolson then parachuted and was peppered by the shotgun of a 
home guard volunteer who thought he was a german he survived but 
was killed in may 1945 when his bomber crashed in the bay of bengal 
in india 
churchill wrote in his diary during the battle of britain the 
odds were great our margins small the stakes infinite 
his most memorable tribute came at the height of the battle on 
aug 20 when he told the house of commons never in the field of 
human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few

on one terrible day four hurricane fighters 
rushed up toward a huge formation of german planes although i was 
only 12 and understood little about war i knew the odds looked 
impossible 
in less than two minutes all four hurricanes were shot down i 
saw parachutes and i thought everything was coming down on top of 
us blazing wreckage as well as the flyers but air distance is 
deceptive and they all fell several miles away 
we tried to salvage bits of wreckage but soldiers and police 
officers shooed us off 
during the battle of britain i was a schoolboy amid the 
wheatfields hop gardens and orchards of kent in southeast england 
it was a wonderful summer of long warm days and blue skies but the 
tranquillity was shattered day after day with the frightening 
bursting of bombs and the roar of lowflying aircraft 
in one dogfight over yorkletts our village a messerschmitt 
shot down a hurricane and continued diving firing back at a heavy 
machinegun post 
i was 30 feet away and the noise was shattering the 
messerschmitt missed and tracer bullets were burning on the ground 
the hurricane pilot survived but his plane was junk 
fishing in the marshes on another day i came close to death a 
strafing messerschmitt sprayed bullets at me it was so sudden that 
i only dived to the ground after the plane had passed i wasnt 
hurt 
raiding german bombers flew over from france in high tidy 
formations their fighter escorts weaving among the heinkels 
dorniers and ju88s 
on a clear day you could see planes fighting three miles high 
black dots weaving about you could hear the short bursts from 
british machine guns and the slower louder tacktacktack from 
heavier german cannons 
scattered by the raf planes the german formations would fly 
home fast but low enough for us to make out their swastikas and 
black crosses 
i once looked up into the face of a messerschmitt pilot who 
scraped the tops of the tall elm trees with a spitfire on his tail 
and he looked at me 
if the bombers were driven back before they reached their 
military targets they dropped their bombs anywhere destroying 
homes and cratering fields 
at twilight after a day of heavy bombing on sept 15 we could 
see the sky was all red over london 45 miles away that night the 
wind carried to us the smell of london burning 
to the south of yorkletts lay a village called dunkirk at 
dunkirk stood seven lofty towers nobody knew what they were one 
man said they were part of a death ray experiment 
the germans bombed dunkirk in august the first we knew of it 
was the loudest noise i heard throughout the war tremendous bangs 
as antiaircraft guns nearby opened up at the bombers 
only after the war did we discover that these were radio 
direction and ranging towers radar for short part of a chain 
that helped win the battle of britain by locating incoming enemy 
planes

editors note as chairman of the senate armed services 
committee sen sam nunn dga is at center stage in the debate 
over postcold war cutbacks in military spending a man to be 
reckoned with heres a look at the man and his style a southerner 
often mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 1992 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
say his name in washington and you speak of 
power watch him closely and you witness a senator exuding the 
quiet confidence of competence 
question his ambitions and sam nunn will wince making you 
think hes just another georgian trying to survive the rigors of 
the capital 
as chairman of the senate armed services committee nunns power 
will be felt in the coming months as the senate weighs major 
military reductions in a postcold war atmosphere 
in a chamber filled with politicians nunn gives the impression 
of being more comfortable crunching pentagon budget numbers than 
gladhanding passersby 
studious and serious nunn is often mentioned as a possible 
presidential candidate in 1992 yet his most brazen political deeds 
of recent years have been confined to work within the democratic 
party to broaden its base among conservative voters 
nunn at 51 has attained a position in his political life that 
would bring a proud grin to the face of his greatuncle and mentor 
the late carl vinson legendary chairman of the house armed 
services committee and the only civilian to have a navy battleship 
named for him 
i dont think anyone on our side has figured it out says 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo marveling at the respect and 
deference shown by many senators toward nunn 
in a series of recent speeches nunn has already staked out his 
position in the allbutcertain fight over military spending he 
outlined his preferred level of spending and charged that president 
bushs budget is flawed with big blanks including the absence 
of an assessment of the threat to us national security a 
military strategy in response to the threat the future size of the 
armed forces how to meet required budget cuts and the need for 
major weapons 
bushs budget nunn said is based on a 1988 threat and a 1988 
strategy 
he said the congress would fill in the blanks if the 
administration doesnt 
the speeches came four months after defense secretary dick 
cheney had presented the administrations budget to congress yet 
nunn captured the headlines and set the tone for the debate 
hes very focused determined wellreasoned rational and 
tothepoint says rep john rowland rconn a member of the 
house armed services committee 
he wields his authority very judiciously and fairly and 
temperately says sen john warner of virginia the ranking 
republican on the senate armed services committee 
the defense budget falls within the purview of the armed 
services panel and as chairman of the panel nunn is one of a 
handful of lawmakers who have control over the largest portion of 
the federal budget 
nunn oversees the closeddoor crafting of the defense 
authorization bill by the 20member committee once the bill 
reaches the senate floor he is one of two managers who can ensure 
that an amendment is introduced 
nunns power was never more evident than last september when the 
senate working on the 288 billion defense spending bill restored 
600 million for president bushs strategic defense initiative 
program 
two days before the vote the senate had slashed 900 million 
from the star wars program an action that undercut nunns position 
in house and senate negotiations 
nunn pleaded with the senate to send a message to the house 
negotiators the senate answered the request 5347 and restored 
twothirds of the star wars funds 
on the other hand nunn widely viewed as nonpartisan took on 
bush and his nominee for defense secretary john tower 
allegations of womanizing excessive drinking and close ties to 
military contractors undermined towers selection and nunn led 
senate democrats in handing bush his first major defeat of the new 
term 
nunnpartisan complained senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas 
yet the wounds inflicted over the tower nomination healed 
quickly and by september it was nunn who ensured that bushs 
military budget was adopted by congress largely intact 
sen john mccain rariz who fought nunn during the tower 
debate says that despite the contentious encounters nunn is 
very highly regarded by all of us republican and democrat 
robert costello the former procurement czar at the pentagon 
says simply that nunn has clout because he has brains 
yet georgias senior senator who has spent 17 years on capitol 
hill dismisses the suggestion that he wields the power in the 
military realm 
any time you want to legislate around here you have to 
convince an awful lot of people over a long period of time to get 
something accomplished so whatever power there is on capitol hill 
is widely diffused nunn said in an interview 
nunn learned early in his career how congress works when vinson 
hired him in 1962 to serve as counsel to the house armed services 
subcommittee on investigations 
vinson didnt make the process easy for his grandnephew 
dispatching one of the committees counsels john j courtney to 
georgia to review nunns law school transcript and interview his 
professors at emory university 
uncle carl waited until i got the actual results of the bar 
exam before he hired me nunn says

the yearlong job provided a practical education in the workings 
of congress and the military as well as a sobering introduction to 
cold war politics 
the overall experience framed nunns approach upon his return to 
private law practice in his hometown of perry ga 100 miles south 
of atlanta 
it had a big effect on my reading and my studying and my 
retention of information that related to congress not just on 
military but in general nunn says 
after four years in the georgia house of representatives nunn 
sought the us senate seat left vacant by the death of richard b 
russell who chaired the senate armed services committee for 16 
years 
but vinson urged him not to run and telephoned some supporters 
suggesting that they withhold financial support says rep richard 
ray dga who worked as nunns administrative assistant for 10 
years 
vinson had reservations about his greatnephew taking on such a 
task and believed he should run for a lesser position ray says 
nevertheless nunn challenged thengeorgia gov jimmy carters 
appointee won the primary by a slim margin and went on to win the 
general election 
he gained a little seniority when he was sworn in in november 
1972 to finish the remaining months of russells term he was soon 
named to the armed services committee 
once there tragedy propelled nunn into the spotlight when the 
panels chairman sen john stennis dmiss was shot and forced 
to take time off to recover 
sen stuart symington dmo briefly assumed the committee 
chairmanship and relied on nunn to handle some of the panels 
chores 
one such project was a comprehensive study of nato late in 1973 
his report provided the young senator with his first national 
publicity 
issues surrounding the 16member nato alliance and military 
personnel proved to be the key for nunn as he staked out a 
conservative position on defense 
he picked his issues very well in the beginning starting out 
with manpower and nato both of them very hotbutton issues 
mccain says 
nunn largely favored increases in military spending during the 
reagan years but in march 1987 challenged the administrations 
interpretation of the antiballistic missile treaty to allow work 
on the star wars missile defense system 
nunn developed a reputation as hardworking bright and 
knowledgeable says john isaacs of the liberal council for a 
livable world but the think tanks director believes nunn is 
supercautious and unlikely to get himself out on a limb 
nunn rarely reacts immediately to the latest announcement from 
the pentagon or pronouncement from the white house choosing 
instead to craft a careful response that is often issued when the 
rhetoric has died down 
the cautious style comes from nunns father who was 50 years 
old when his son was born 
you could ask him a question and he might sit there for five 
minutes literally before he ever answered nunn recalls 
some people would go ahead and become so nervous theyd ask six 
more questions but hed still be trying to frame the original 
answer in a precise way in a way that was meaningful 
aside from his reputation as a defense expert nunn is also well 
known for his proficiency at golf his handicap is in the single 
digits with dan quayle now a member of the executive branch the 
senate armed services chairman has few rivals for the title of top 
golfer in the senate 
warner says nunns frugal approach has emerged on the golf 
course 
sometimes you have to hold him back from wading six feet out 
into a pond from recovering a golf ball the republican senator 
said 
recently nunn has ventured into campaigning for other democratic 
candidates and in the process his name has been bandied about for 
higher office specifically the presidency 
back in july 1979 nunn seemed to squelch that saying i 
think without any insinuations intended that the nation will not 
be looking for another georgia president in my lifetime 
but the call grew so loud that nunn was forced to announce in 
february 1987 that he would not seek the presidency he is 
unopposed in his senate reelection bid this fall 
with the 1992 presidential race not far off nunn refuses to 
shut the door entirely says he has no inclination or plans to seek 
higher office 
i dont rule out the possibility that one of these days ill 
decide that i may be more interested in exploring the presidency 
but i would have to feel that i had the substantive answers to an 
awful lot of the challenges facing america he says 
ill take another look after the november election and im 
sure ill be talking to a lot of people but based on the reagan 
rule ive got a lot of years left and i dont want to make any 
concrete statements about the future

to his admiring flock the rev louis gigante is 
the priest who saved his ravaged parish hes the builder who 
stopped the urban death march in his south bronx neighborhood 
built new homes fought crack and crime 
to federal investigators hes the brother of vincent the 
chin gigante 62 the bathrobeclad reputed boss of the genovese 
crime family which has for years maintained its grip on new yorks 
building industry 
to the family of a harlem teenager accused in the gangrape of 
a jogger in central park louis gigante is the angel who posted 
25000 bail from his own funds so the youth could be released from 
jail 
to tabloid readers hes the priest who sat in jail for a week 
in 1979 because he wouldnt tell a grand jury about his prison 
conversations with reputed gangster james napoli a man he 
described as an old dear friend 
to one and all the 57yearold pastor is no ordinary man of the 
cloth 
iris gonzalez a member of gigantes parish who has known him 
for nearly three decades wont discuss how a man she so admires 
could have a sibling so infamous 
the fingers of the same hand are not the same she says 
there were five gigante children their parents immigrated from 
naples italy and settled in a coldwater flat in greenwich 
village 
the boys were athletic louis the youngest was an allstar 
high school basketball player while vincent scored in the boxing 
ring 
louis graduated from georgetown university on an athletic 
scholarship he attended st josephs seminary in yonkers was 
ordained a priest in 1959 and sent to puerto rico for two years 
in 1962 he was assigned to st athanasius church on tiffany 
street in the south bronx by the late 60s the neighborhood was 
in rapid decline and fires were wiping out the housing stock 
burnedout buildings were bulldozed leaving entire blocks leveled 
gigante turned to politics to fight the destruction running 
unsuccessfully for the democratic nomination for congress in 1970 
the next year he founded his own bruckner democratic club in 
1973 he was elected to a fouryear term on the city council 
during his years as a councilman the priestpolitician 
persuaded the government to allocate millions of tax dollars to 
rehabilitate the south bronx the money was funneled through the 
south east bronx community organization sebco a notforprofit 
housing developer 
the president and chairman of sebco is louis gigante 
the rev gigante brought a second spring to the hunts point 
section of the south bronx says new yorks cardinal john j 
oconnor who calls him the roman catholic churchs master 
builder 
he helped people there is more housing less drugs people 
get together they make a community says victoria serra who 
came to mass on a recent sunday with her mother rosa before 
drugs were all around us he led a march from door to door and we 
posted signs against drugs its a much better place now 
four years ago mrs gonzalez moved into a sebcobuilt apartment 
before youd be afraid of being here but now the 
neighborhood is changed 100 percent he helped people who had 
problems with drugs and alcohol people who were unemployed she 
says 
hes turned the neighborhood around says alberto negron 
28 glancing at the prefabricated wooden houses standing alongside 
crumbling brownstones 
st athanasius church is ringed by one and twofamily 
creamcolored homes with driveways iron security fences and 
gardens in contrast the area is surrounded by garbagestrewn lots 
with torched cars next to gutted houses the dismal south bronx 
that writer tom wolfe used as the setting for his novel the 
bonfire of the vanities 
it was a ghost town before father g built this and got 
parishioner support adds negron who was baptized in the church 
this neighborhood was terrible the houses were down 
everything was bad there was nothing says rsa serra father 
g is good i know him for 20 years the neighborhood is good now 
and he did it through faith 
nonetheless last year a manhattan grand jury began 
investigating whether the hunts point housing revolution may have 
included inflated bids and kickbacks to organized crime it 
subpoenaed sebcos financial records for the past three years 
court sources said 
sebcos offices are near the church rectory where the priest 
lived for years now he reportedly commutes in a cadillac or 
another of his six cars to several apartments in manhattan and an 
upstate country home sometimes he flies to a condominium in san 
juan puerto rico

tax records show he personally owns sebco management the 
company that oversees sebcobuilt real estate its only one of at 
least a half dozen companies with varying addresses and different 
names all sharing the sebco root that are listed in the 
bronx telephone directory 
the priestpolitician vehemently denies ever being directly 
investigated and authorities have never officially linked him with 
any organized crime family 
but sebco according to a report in the village voice last year 
has steered about 50 million in governmentfinanced construction 
to companies with alleged ties to the genovese crime family 
louis gigante through a sebco spokeswoman refused to be 
interviewed gigante has said hes tired of reporters references 
to his brother and crime 
the priest reportedly says the mafia doesnt exist 
but authorities say vincent the chin gigante is every bit as 
ruthless as the betterknown john gotti his organized crime 
archrival as the reputed head of the gambino family 
though some say he is mentally deranged and he wears a 
bathrobe pajamas and slippers as he rambles through the streets of 
greenwich village jules j bonavolonta the fbis mob and 
narcotics chief says gigante is crazy like a fox 
as far as were concerned hes still the boss of the 
family bonavolonta said 
while his brother turned to the priesthood the chin chose a 
life among criminals in his teens he became a protege of mobster 
vito genovese he was arrested seven times between the ages of 17 
and 25 though most of the charges were dismissed 
eventually vincent gigante came to be regarded as an enforcer 
of genovese orders he was charged with attempted murder after a 
botched hit on crime boss frank costello he got off when costello 
refused to testify against him 
he was jailed in 1959 for five years on a narcotics conspiracy 
charge eleven years later he was charged with trying to bribe the 
police force of old tappan nj but avoided prosecution by 
pleading mental incompetence 
now federal prosecutors believe theyve finally nailed the 
chin he is among 15 members of four mob families charged with 
monopolizing the installation of windows in city housing projects 
since 1978 accompanied by kickbacks to organized crime 
but gigantes lawyer barry slotnick says his mental state 
is such that he couldnt be the boss of a candy store 
earlier this year louis gigante and the gigante family filed 
legal papers to have vincent declared incompetent and his finances 
placed in their hands later they dropped their application 
decrying the attention it had drawn 
two other gigante brothers mario and ralph also are said to be 
genovese soldiers but louis gigante has not distanced himself from 
his wayward kin 
last year sen alfonse damato rny conceded the rev 
gigante had appealed to him on behalf of mario who was serving an 
eightyear prison sentence on loansharking charges louis gigante 
reportedly argued that his brothers prison sentence was too long 
damato said he spoke to thenus attorney rudolph giuliani in 
1984 and 1985 on behalf of the gigantes he was passing on his 
concern for a priest to the prosecutors office damato said 
at the altar of the 80yearold gothicstyle church where he has 
celebrated mass for 28 years gigante blesses kneeling parishioners 
while ceiling fans stir the air thick gold bracelets hang from the 
priests wrists 
as far as his parishioners are concerned gigante can do little 
wrong and he has ridden out storms that would have sent other 
priests scurrying to a monastery 
last year he created a media blitz by posting 25000 of his own 
money to bail out kevin richardson a teenager charged in the 
april 1989 gangrape of a jogger in central park 
an angel came to us said howard diller the lawyer for 
richardson whose baptist family in harlem couldnt afford the 
money rich people and gangsters shouldnt be the only ones who 
are freed on high cash bail 
these are 14yearolds i dont want them to rape again 
gigante told his congregation jail is not a good place to 
rehabilitate delinquent youths he explained to his flock 
after the morning mass the priest hugged and kissed 
parishioners smiling at them as they left through the church door 
that overlooks a new square 
its surface is bricklaid and swept clean thanks to him

editors note she was truly an innocent abroad a new york 
city girl with little command of the french language and even less 
skilled in home repair that nothwithstanding she and a friend 
bought a 180yearold house in rural france when she set out to 
try to make it livable the doityourself way she found herself in 
a heap of trouble even running afoul of the law 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

first there was a bag hanging from our 
doorknob with lettuce so fresh from the ground a snail was still 
crawling through its leaves 
then a whitehaired country woman in her faded print smock and 
heavy shoes showed up in person to offer a promenade through 
the village to her vegetable garden 
as we made our way down the rutted dirt road she tried to 
teach a city girl from manhattan the names in french of the trees 
and flowers that i couldnt even identify in english 
i also picked up that day the misdirections that got me arrested 
by three gendarmes and hauled before the mayor for illegal dumping 
and so it went for the next two weeks me and my adopted home 
coming to grips with each other what one might call the 
gentrification of a tiny village in southwestern france and the 
frenchification of me 
an english friend and i had bought the house together in the 
spring of 1989 we did it on an impulse a whim for one thing it 
was cheap 
the 180yearold fourstory stucco and stone house with its 
red tile roof and electricity and proper plumbing cost little more 
than say an american minivan and taxes are only several hundred 
dollars a year 
so here i was a year later coming to claim my new home a new 
york city apartment dweller who cant find the start button on her 
own vacuum cleaner thinking all i needed to do for a house 
beautiful was find a flea market and proceed to buy french country 
antiques 
i was armed with a longago d in college french and a blue 
plastic tool kit shaped like a briefcase that i ordered from an 
upscale catalog the screwdrivers and pliers all had coordinated 
yellow handles and i had my 81yearold mother in tow to help me 
select the antiques 
the village has 500 residents a church a post office a city 
hall an elementary school a tiny grocery a gold statue of the 
virgin and a world war i monument topped by a gold chicken or some 
manner of bird the monument sits at the top of a tiny dirt square 
dominated by trees and large wooden geometic shapes that are either 
art or a childrens jungle gym 
the hub of the village is a big open sundrenched space that 
for some reason makes me think of gary cooper and high noon 
nothing happens there much except a couple of times a day when a 
merchant comes through to peddle olives or fish or shoes from his 
truck 
the houses crammed in close and facing each other on narrow 
crooked streets create a perpetual shade 
there is no restaurant no filling station the boulangerie is 
open only a few hours in the morning for fresh bread and 
croissants if you dont get there early everything is sold or 
reserved 
theres also the wine cooperative the raison detre for this 
village and all the others scattered through this area that cups 
around the western shore of the mediterranean from the lowland 
deltas south to the spanish border and from the foothills and 
craggy rock cliffs north to marseille 
each village cooperative has its own wine label bar owners and 
local residents alike come in with any sort of container large or 
small and get filled up from a hose attached to one of the huge 
stainless steel vats 
the area was settled by the romans and the mentality of living 
in something of a circle behind walls still prevails outside the 
walls the families of ceyras each own their own plot among the 
tilled and blooming gardens cascading down the side of a hill that 
drops off into the herault river 
their vineyards are generally beyond the village if they still 
till them the old vintners are dying off price supports for wine 
have dropped and the young sons and grandsons all seem to want 
paris 
so the english and other europeans from unsunny climes have 
discovered that these old farmers vacant and often neglected homes 
offer rare bargains in an otherwise outrageously expensive france 
never a farmers daughter i had nonetheless come home 
and it was a rough two weeks the culture shock had as much to 
do with unaccustomed labor broken fingernails and plaster dust 
that coated my hair like a lacquer as it had to do with rural 
living in a language i couldnt speak

i fell asleep each night often in my dirty work clothes in a 
panic that my brain was going to explode rather than accept one 
more new word or sensation 
trying to buy paint remover is a major project you cant tell 
the salesperson what you want because you dont know the word so 
you wander around searching for something that looks likely then 
you get out the dictionary and start trying to read all the labels 
it took several days to get settled in with the proper gaskets 
for the generic wine bottles i finally located in a junk store i 
proudly took them to the winery carrying them in a wire rack such 
as milkmen used for home deliveries during the days when they did 
that sort of thing only to be shown not told that the loosely 
attached ceramic corks would leak unless i had a washer the amused 
attendant at the cooperative told me the french word rondelle but 
it took two trips to the hardware store to get the right size 
i learned to distinguish the slight difference between the 
french words for stove and hot water heater and i learned for the 
first time in any language the difference between plaster and 
plasterboard the plaster was what was in my hair 
things got better for my hair after i finally figured out how to 
ask monsieur boisseau my acrossthestreet neighbor if he knew 
someone i could hire to strip wallpaper and knock plaster off old 
beams 
it was that plaster that got me arrested my wonderful worker 
jean claude was knocking it off licketysplit and we were ankle 
deep in the powdery stuff as id fret about what to do with it 
hed repeat we needed a petite camion which i took to be a 
pickup he assumed i didnt understand but actually i had no idea 
how to go about getting one 
finally with the help of madame rieufregier the garden lady 
we decided to scoop the broken plaster into heavyduty fertilizer 
bags she saves and haul it in my spanking clean rented car 
mrs rieufregier told us where riverains residents could 
dump and i thought she said at the west edge of the village but 
at jean claudes direction we landed up on the east 
the gendarmes got there right after we did if you think 
american cops are bad chasing after speeders and illegal parkers 
when they should be arresting drug pushers and other manner of 
crooks just remember this story of three gendarmes wasting more 
than two hours with me in their van being grilled about my broken 
plaster 
they checked me through their computer to see if the car was 
stolen they asked me how much i paid the worker how long id 
known him then something else about pay when i said yes 
thinking they were asking if i would pay his fine i really got a 
grilling we went around that two or three times and they kept 
using the word fiche which normally is some sort of a bill 
when all the sudden my head went whoa it hit me that i might 
have an illegal immigrant on my hands or maybe i was supposed to 
be paying payroll taxes 
finally i just put my hands out in front of me wrists close 
together who knows the word for handcuffs but its a universal 
gesture they laughed and took me to the mayor 
not before i might add one of them asked me in a most acerbic 
tone il nya pas decologie en amerique 
you didnt have to speak much french to catch the sarcasm and 
pointed intent that theres no ecology in america meant 
flibbertigibbet foreigners bent on running around despoiling the 
french countryside were in for a hassle 
despite all my pratfalls the signs were encouraging 
the mayor laughed and shook my hand when i apologized for my 
legal transgressions the cops got a good laugh when i told his 
honor i was enchanted to make your acquaintance a stilted 
phrase straight out of french 1a 
several local men hanging out in a garage gossiping and smoking 
cigarettes teased me as i passed by about how i seemed to relish 
the local wine the caretaker at the cooperative gave me a bottle 
of champagne on my last day apparently in appreciation of what a 
good customer id been 
it all came i suspect from that promenade through the village 
with madame rieufregier all the old ladies were sticking their 
heads out their windows or making it a point to pass by and say 
bonjour 
madame rieufregier told me she had 70 years and that she had 
been born in this village one couldnt ask for a better sponsor 
than that

editors note cape cod that storied massachusetts retreat by 
the sea is still not without its charm but its a paradise 
threatened by the bulldozer and concrete mixer and local residents 
have begun to fight back

you can still drive to the corner of 
irving and scudder avenues in hyannis port and peek down at the 
whiteshingled kennedy compound nestled on rolling green lawns 
overlooking the broad expanse of lewis bay 
the neighborhood of large stately summer homes which includes 
a tiny red post office and a weathered dock at the end of the 
street looks almost exactly as it did the summer before john f 
kennedy was elected president 30 years ago 
but less than two miles away in downtown hyannis the landscape 
has changed dramatically and not necessarily for the better as a 
result cape cod residents have approved a sweeping new measure 
that they hope will curb helterskelter growth and restore some of 
the areas rural charm 
its a pigpen here says alexander theroux a yale professor 
and writer who has lived in west barnstable since 1974 when i 
moved here it was a lovely place 
route 132 once a pastoral road linking hyannis with the rest of 
cape cod is now a dizzying strip of fastfood restaurants 
billboards and shopping malls construction is almost complete on 
the enormous and controversial christmas tree plaza traffic is 
often backed up for miles 
elsewhere on the cape a flat sandy peninsula attached to 
mainland massachusetts by two bridges spanning the cape cod canal 
signs of trouble are everywhere 
contaminated shellfish beds ponds tainted by acid rain 
overflowing dumps ground water pollution 
the intersection at one corner in harwich is called the dust 
bowl by locals because of the swirling dust kicked up by a 
24acre construction site for an office and shopping center that 
has been stripped bare for two years 
i miss the tranquillity and independence that used to be out 
here says jack smith 65 the owner of jacks outback restaurant 
in yarmouth and a 50year resident of the cape i miss dirt roads 
and i miss pulling out onto main street knowing there wouldnt be 
anyone coming in either direction 
the population on the cape a 67mile strip that runs from near 
plymouth out to provincetown has swollen in the last two decades 
in 1960 the oldest town on the cape sandwich had 2000 
residents now it numbers 16000 and is still growing 
many cape cod residents weary of the minigolf outlets and 
kandy korner shops that have sprung up to accommodate the influx of 
tourists have decided its time to take action 
in march they approved the cape cod commission act which 
resulted in the formation of a county commission to regulate 
development on a regional basis up until now the 15 towns that 
comprise the cape have overseen development on an individual basis 
the 19member land use and planning commission is designed to 
control developments that will affect the region and protect 
critical natural and manmade resources 
the commission is not unlike other regional and statewide 
planning agencies around the country the adirondacks state park in 
new york lake tahoe pine barrens nj and marthas vineyard 
island off cape cod are areas with similar policies the california 
coastal commission regulates coastal development along the coast 
the cape cod commission also borrowed heavily from floridas 
statewide landuse policy 
proponents hope that the roughly 70000 acres of developable 
land left on cape cod will be more stringently monitored 
people said were sick of growth and development and were 
sick of the dismantling of cape cod says susan nickerson 
executive director of the association for the preservation of cape 
cod formed in 1968 when residents became alarmed over a proposal 
to cut a waterway into nauset marsh for oil tankers 
some of the statistics compiled by the group 
the cape cod population growth is 10 times the state average 
the number of housing units on the cape has doubled in the past 
20 years 
more open space was lost on the cape during the 1980s than any 
other region in the state 
the average home price on the cape has tripled just in the past 
decade 
about 6000 acres of shellfish beds remain closed an eightfold 
increase in just eight years 
most of those statistic apply to the socalled upper cape 
the communities around hyannis and to the west the lower cape 
which is the farthest from the mainland and includes more rural 
areas such as truro and the art colony of provincetown has escaped 
what one environmental activist called the schlock of the upper 
cape 
its a special place says nickerson a lifelong cape cod 
resident it shouldnt be turned into long island 
but real estate developers disagree they contend the cape cod 
commission will drive up prices for singlefamily homes and hamper 
the right of landowners to develop their properties 
the cape thrives on the building business says nick franco 
a cape cod developer for 17 years who has projects in hyannis and 
marstons mills the sad part is that there is a very little 
supply of land when you take that supply away from developers 
there will be a lot fewer homes and theyll be a lot more 
expensive a lot of the working people will have to leave cape 
cod 
but franco says its a misconception that all developers 
opposed the commission he voted for the commission he says 
because he knew he would profit from the sudden crackdown on 
development 
land is becoming dearer because of this franco says the 
day after the vote every one of my lots became worth 15 percent 
more 
environmentalists including former us sen paul tsongas who 
has a home on the cape dismisses claims that housing will become 
too expensive saying the real mission is to preserve the quality 
of life on the cape 
left unchecked cape cod would lose its character says 
tsongas who chaired a committee that recommended a moratorium on 
building on the cape its one of the few places in the country 
that really have a separate identity the concern was that cape cod 
was beginning to look like everything else

editors note no other spot in japan has quite the cachet of 
the ginza in tokyo its a paradise for hedonists an elegant 
shopping center a place where dinner can cost 800 a plate its 
also a place where oriental traditions persist where businessmen 
stay in touch with their local gods 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
thumping drums wooden clappers and eerie flute 
music draw the people of the neighborhood out to watch as 
shopkeepers parade a golden shrine through the streets oblivious 
to the honking horns of backedup traffic 
each year the ginzas busy shopkeepers put aside their work for 
a few hours to celebrate their local gods seeking protection from 
calamity for the worlds most expensive neighborhood 
the ginza is japans fifth avenue bond street champs elysees 
all wrapped into one its deluxe department stores cater to 
japanese matrons and a steady stream of tourists its bars and 
restaurants offer any type of cuisine in practically any imaginable 
setting 
it also is home to 3615 people who keep their traditions alive 
on land costing as much as 23700 a square foot 
by day the ginzas urban landscape is brightened only by 
luxurious window displays and weeping willows and maples along 
quiet side streets 
by night the neon lights of hundreds of pubs restaurants and 
hostess bars transform the district into a glittering paradise 
of female companionship good food and drink for men with deep 
pockets or hefty expense accounts 
no other spot in japan has quite the cachet of the ginza 
since the turn of the century this tiny district squeezed 
between the imperial palace and tokyo bay has been the place to be 
hundreds of optimistic shopping streets throughout japan bear the 
name ginza but none match its opulence or prestige 
four hundred years ago the ginza was under tokyo bay 
in 1603 one of japans most powerful shoguns tokugawa ieyasu 
moved to tokyo then known as edo he ordered part of the bay 
filled in 
under a later shogun a silver mint or ginza in japanese 
bequeathed the district its prophetic name at the time it was an 
earthy market and entertainment district 
after fires destroyed posh shops and villas slightly to the 
north shopkeepers moved into the ginza some have been there ever 
since 
the ginza itself has risen phoenixlike from ashes several 
times each time becoming more modern and western 
a fire in 1869 shortly after rulers in the modernizing meiji 
era declared that japan would learn from the west cleared the way 
for treelined avenues of londonstyle brick buildings 
just a few feet of those brick walls remain intact the 
westernstyle shops crumbled and burned in 1923 when a powerful 
earthquake leveled most of tokyo 
all but a few of the buildings constructed after that disaster 
were destroyed by us firebombing during world war ii 
today only a few prewar buildings remain and most of the 
buildings thrown up just after the war have been torn down to make 
way for modern structures most conform to an eightstory limit 
imposed to reduce earthquake and fire hazards and to give everyone 
at least a glimpse of sunshine 
ginzas night life its department stores and small shops all 
have an air of cosmopolitan elegance there are shoe stores with 
names like washington and america londonstyle tailors parisian 
brasseries and cafes and some 250 art galleries crowded into an 
area only about 1100 yards by 650 yards 
beneath the veneer of western commerce however the ginza is as 
japanese as its kabuki theaters 
in the morning shopkeepers fastidiously sweep in front of their 
stores wipe windows and splash the sidewalks to keep the dust 
down when department stores open to waiting crowds in the morning 
uniformclad clerks bow deeply and say irrashaimase welcome 
wellestablished department stores with names like wako 
mitsukoshi matsuzakaya and matsuya sell designer dresses and 
caviar but they also sell tofu sushi and dried fish and have tiny 
shrines or temples on their roofs to consecrate their businesses 
naohisa nagai 42 is the eighth generation in his family to run 
the echigoya kimono shop which has been in the ginza since 1800 
people have worn kimono for ages now they only wear them for 
special purposes such as ceremonies or in certain professions but 
even if the number of customers falls the number of shops like 
ours is also falling so we can stay in business nagai says 
on weekend afternoons when ginza dori the main street is 
closed to traffic families and dating couples crowd the sidewalks 
and shops continuing a tradition of ginbura or strolling on 
the ginza 
in the evenings sidewalk vendors left over from the times when 
night markets filled the streets still sell noodles and grilled 
rice cakes wind chimes flowers candy and toys palmists and 
fortunetellers wait serenely for customers 
beefy sumo wrestlers in robes and wooden sandals stride among 
suitclad businessmen and women in fancy dresses or kimono all 
headed for bars where a single drink could cost 127 or more 
in east ginza powerful businessmen and politicians gather in 
exclusive traditional restaurants called ryotei that charge 
800 a person or more for a single meal rickshaws carry geisha 
girls many aged but still elegant masters of traditional dance and 
music between the secretive tan stucco buildings with their 
miniature gardens at the entrances 
in recent years the ginzas less expensive wine bars and 
restaurants have drawn growing crowds of young japanese 
this is the best its ever been says yuji ishimaru who has 
run the ginza street association of local merchants for 31 years 
the young people really love the old atmosphere and the older 
men dont seem to mind being crowded out they want new generations 
to follow them 
the ginzas population mostly concentrated in its less 
glamorous eastern half has fallen from 8344 in 1970 to 3615 this 
year as inheritance taxes and high land costs forced shop owners to 
sell out leaving only a few diehards tiny shops sandwiched 
between modern buildings to fight land developers 
in his office ishimaru 53 proudly displays photographs of a 
local festival and a neighborhood visit to the nearby imperial 
palace to pay respects to the emperor 
we are all children of our local diety and of the emperor 
he says that remains very important to me

rick dees the los angeles radio personality 
who is taking his wacky style of comedy into the latenight tv 
wars says he wont be a copycat 
into the night starring rick dees debuts monday july 16 
and will be seen every weekday night on abc at 12 midnight after 
nightline 
that makes dees the latest entrant into the latenight battle 
for audiences with johnny carson on nbcs the tonight show 
nbcs late night with david letterman and arsenio the 
syndicated show starring arsenio hall the latest in a long list of 
casualties was pat sajak whose cbs show was canceled after little 
more than a year 
dees was voted the nations no 1 radio personality for six 
years by billboard magazine his morning show on los angeles radio 
station kiisfm is first in the arbitron radio ratings hes also 
the nations highestpaid radio personality 
dees like his predecessors says hes not in competition with 
the established shows in fact he says he would like carson 
letterman and hall to be guests on his show 
i think the approach were taking is not to copy whats gone 
before dees says id describe our show as one thats 
primarily comedy with regular features well have the hottest 
music and well endeavor to have the hottest guests we can get 
but the show will not be guestdriven were going to give away 
money for guessing such things as the mystery oldie song 
i want to represent things that are good if i can make people 
feel better at that time of the night well be successful were 
going to have four senior citizens picked from around the country 
sitting on lawn chairs and voicing their opinions 
dees is host of a morning radio show on kiis and the nationally 
syndicated rick dees weekly top 40 his record disco duck 
sold more than 4 million copies in 1976 since then hes had four 
hit comedy albums hes the voice of rock dees on the 
flintstones and of rocket rick in the upcoming the jetsons the 
movie he had a small role in the movie la bamba 
my favorite voice was mel blanc he says he did some 
voices for me and that tape is one of my most prized possessions 
dees grew up in greensboro nc and started in radio in 
birmingham ala and memphis before coming to los angeles in 1980 
after a year my station went to a country format and i was out 
of work he says hollywood let me know real fast you have to 
pay your dues first i couldnt get a job for a year i called kiis 
and told the station manager id do anything for a chance to do a 
show he said thanks for your interest but why dont you go back 
where you came from 
i couldnt understand that kind of attitude funny is funny 
it doesnt matter where you are or where youre from 
three months later the station had a new manager and dees 
eventually got his chance his show beginning in 1984 broke all 
arbitron ratings 
into the night will feature announcer lisa canning billy 
vera and the beaters band and two repertory comedy players greg 
binkley and bob perlow it will be taped every night before an 
audience at the abc studios for its latenight showing 
this represents a new venture for abc which has not had a 
regular latenight show other than the news show nightline 
since 1975 dick cavett and jimmy breslin alternated as hosts of 
latenight talk shows in 198082 abc had fridays on one night 
a week cavett also had a talk show in the 1970s followed by the 
abc wide world of entertainment 
abc tested three other concepts over a period of three years 
before deciding to go ahead with dees show 
they told me we were starting from zero he says they 
said i had seven viewers and would have to build on that people 
ask me what audience im going after i turn that around and say 
im going after as wide an audience as possible then after ive 
been on a while you tell me what my audience is 
dees says he compares his comedy style to ernie kovacs a 
television pioneer whose original and zany comedy probably 
influenced many performers and writers 
his wife julie dees has created much of the material for the 
new show boy if i could get as lucky as ernie kovacs did with 
edie adams wouldnt that be great he says

in the world of set and costume design santo 
loquasto is one of broadways big guns he has taken home a tony 
award two years in a row to prove it 
last year his atmospheric recreation of an old theatrical 
hangout on new yorks lower east side for cafe crown was named 
broadways best set design so realistic was the setting that it 
now sits in storage in new jersey while plans are made to use its 
dark wooden bar tables and chairs in a reallife restaurant 
this year loquastos stylish 1920s wardrobe for the employees 
and guests of the musical grand hotel picked up the 
bestcostume award no word on whether the bellhop outfits are 
wanted by hilton or hyatt 
and the man can talk with feeling about the profession that has 
been his life for some 30 years ask him for example about what 
makes a good costume and the shaggy bearded loquasto speaks with 
authority 
its all about telling stories he said the other day during 
an interview at barbara matera ltd the shop which made the 
costumes for grand hotel 
a good costume tells us an appropriate amount of information 
about the character but not necessarily everything the designer 
says you might not want too much revealed for example you 
might not want the villain to be twirling a mustache and cane 
the 45yearold designer doesnt work just in the theater he 
has also made a name for himself in dance collaborating with 
choreographers such as jerome robbins and twyla tharp and in the 
movies where directors such as woody allen depend on his sharp eye 
good costumes he adds take in practical considerations too 
like movement and comfort for dance or for musical theater he 
says you want to reveal or expand upon a performers movement not 
obscure it 
revealing it in the purest sense would be wearing as little as 
possible loquasto says or revealing as clean a line as 
possible by adding a shirt or a skirt or whatever which has the 
right weight or movement to it so that the costume will float or 
swing or cling 
loquastos design career began at age 15 when the stagestruck 
youth got a job doing sets and costumes for a summer theater in the 
poconos he was born in wilkesbarre pa and later raised in 
easton and bethlehem mom ran a beauty shop dad was a salesman 
the only showbusiness connection was a great aunt who had worked 
in silentfilm keystone kops comedies 
loquasto hasnt stopped working in the theater since those 
summer stock days after graduation from kings college in 
wilkesbarre there were journeys to the yale school of drama to 
study design and an apprenticeship at the williamstown theater 
festival in massachusetts as well as a lot of work in regional 
theaters such as hartford stage and long wharf both in connecticut 
broadway first saw his designs in the 1970s among his successes 
were that championship season and american buffalo he won 
his first tony award for costumes in 1977 for the lincoln center 
production of the cherry orchard 
besides loquasto grand hotel has two experienced production 
designers tony walton who did the massive twotiered unit set of 
reflective pillars and jules fisher who handled the lighting 
loquasto joined the musical last summer after director tommy 
tune began a workshop production in the workshop the actors wore 
their own clothes augmented by hats and overcoats 
at the time the script for the show which is set in 1928 
berlin still was evolving and tune didnt want the designer to 
rely on it 
all i had to go on was a cast breakdown loquasto recalls 
tommy and i went through it at a meeting he said what he thought 
about the characters and what he thought was important to know 
about them 
there also were certain images that tommy and tony had already 
hit upon and that they thought were wonderful pictures of 
bellhops and certain books on berlin the designer says so i 
just sort of collected all this stuff and started working 
because grand hotel is a relatively spartan unit a oneset 
production it is the livery in the hotel which gives the audience 
a sense of architectural detail in many ways according to loquasto 
the form of the lobby was punctuated by the arrangement of 
bellhops and other hotel staff members he says the designer 
used the same color many shades of brown extending almost to a 
rusty red to suggest to theatergoers the flavor of a luxury hotel 
its not something that hits you over the head but it does 
fill out the space and expand on it he says 
in grand hotel we also did not want to have masses of 
clothing loquasto adds people dont really change their 
costumes a lot its not like a huge show its less than 50 
costumes what they have are spats and shoes and hats and gloves 
and cuff links and overcoats its a big overcoat production 
the hardest costumes in grand hotel were the secretaries 
he says historically those uniforms were not very attractive 
and i wanted the girls to look terrific and be very individual we 
did it in the subtleties of the fit and the fabric so that the 
dresses moved quite well even though they looked like rather dowdy 
uniforms

gloria allreds wardrobe could be jampacked 
with chanel and armani but the polishedlooking attorney 
emphatically declines to pack it that way 
after all she doesnt need a 1000 sweater when she could 
spend the same money helping a woman become governor or to further 
aids research 
a fashion fantasy is still a dream for this feminist that would 
be comfortable attractive practical and lowerpriced clothes 
if women knew how to have a revolution on the price issue 
alone they would says allred who characteristically sniffs out 
sales 
many agree with allred that clothing choice for women is limited 
by finances figure flaws and fashion designers who may not always 
heed the call of the consumer even devout fashion mavens cant 
toss away last seasons outfits simply at the whim of designers who 
dictate the look of the moment 
ask allred what she wears and shell glibly tell you its 
whatevers back from the dry cleaners a response that belies her 
deliberately calculated approach to dressing 
press the subject and shell offer i always view fashion as 
a political statement a not surprising response from this los 
angeles lawyer known for battling for sex equality 
time magazine called her one of the nations most effective 
advocates of family rights and feminist causes and lears deemed 
her lady civil libertya combination of rocky and the 
rockettes 
indeed allred is widely considered one of the most accomplished 
and prominent attorneys in the country she founded and currently 
serves as president of the womens equal rights legal defense and 
education fund she also offers weekly political commentary on kabc 
news in southern california 
surely you wouldnt expect her to hold forth on the beauty of 
frilly little floral prints and peter pan collars and dont expect 
her to discuss techniques for building and updating ones wardrobe 
shed sooner zero in on the consumers plight and just whats 
wrong with the nations fashion and beauty industry 
i often ask myself whos designing for the american working 
woman says allred theres no democracy in the world of 
fashion designers switch styles every season to sell their goods 
prices are completely unrealistic for the consumer its a planned 
obsolescence theyre designing to meet their own needs not the 
needs of the public 
allred has developed her own style for an answer to the dilemma 
she chooses suits that have timeless appeal st john knits occupy 
a portion of her closet because of their practicality i can wear 
them for years theyre high quality look nice throughout the day 
and pack well she says 
with her jetblack hair and porcelain complexion she creates a 
powerful commanding image in her knit suits 
her name in fact says it all the favorite color of this 
fiercely flamboyant advocate is red 
women still lack fashion freedom and independence she insists 
as much as we talk about equality in the workplace women to this 
day are required to comply with an unwritten dress code that they 
must wear dresses or skirts on the job were forced to wear the 
costume of our sex its a gender uniform women wear skirts and 
men wear slacks 
allred nonetheless does not wear pants to court since it would 
make my clothes an issue for the judge and jury instead she 
wears a suit with a skirt just below the knee 
her business clothes are sensible and shaped but not 
formfitting i dont think many men would put up with being 
restricted in a tight skirt she says 
there are political overtones to practically everything in a 
womans closet in allreds view take shoes for example 
my theory is that if your shoes dont allow you to run away 
quickly from a rapist you shouldnt be wearing them allred once 
was raped at gunpoint and nearly died after a subsequent illegal 
abortion 
she wears shoes with a medium to low heel partly for comfort 
and partly because she thinks a jury wants to see an attorney in a 
businesslike image sexy high heels would be inappropriate 
one of the most interesting issues for a jury to discuss among 
themselves is what the lawyer is wearing and i always want to do 
whatever is appropriate to win the case 
then theres her view on pantyhose theyre the ultimate 
example of lack of practicality think about spending 4 to 5 for 
something that is not made to last men would never put up with 
such a consumer ripoff 
and handbags the two most liberating acts a woman can perform 
are to buy comfortable shoes and a big handbag 
allred thinks that makeup and cosmetics need greater regulation 
by the food and drug administration nail polish for example 
contains formaldehyde a carcinogen and women have no idea what 
theyre putting on their bodies 
its a complicated enterprise for any woman to get herself 
together she says i have great admiration for the american 
working woman when i think about how she survives each day she 
has to think about what shell wear makeup shoes underwear 
stockings 
we women have problems men dont even think about

after the revolution eastern europe is suddenly 
chic polish restaurants are favored by londons trendy set 
czechoslovak films play on primetime tv and three of britains 
hottest designers are chips off the old bloc 
edina ronay tomasz starzewski and linda cierach have taken 
inspiration from their hungarian and polish roots peasant 
braiding furtrimmed waistcoats and street styles from the cold 
war years to create collections that fuse an eastern sensibility 
with english swing 
although each designer has a distinctive style all are doing 
booming business among londons young and wellheeled 
eastern europe has been so submerged so hidden since the war 
that few people realize the depth of the design traditions said 
mrs ronay the daughter of a budapest family of restaurateurs who 
still makes regular forays home to shop and see friends 
hungarian embroidery is extraordinary the sequins and the 
waistcoats and the aprons are all so beautiful she said sitting 
on a cushion on the dark wood floor of her intimate kings road 
store 
patterns from an old book on embroidery discovered in a budapest 
antique store inspired the beading on evening jackets capri pants 
and skirts in red and black that are part of her collection for 
next winter 
pictures in a family album of her greatgreatuncle otto in a 
brocade and furtrimmed waistcoat inspired the trim on winter 
evening wear she said 
the 40yearold former actress started designing clothes just 
five years ago now she is one of britains best known designers 
with a reputation for combining the folkloric with the 
aristocratic her clients include actresses lauren bacall and 
charlotte rampling and the duchess of york formerly sarah 
ferguson 
ronay hopes to open a shop someday in budapest starzewski 
dreams of making clothes in poland where his mother was born 
the darling of the daughters of the titled rich starzewskis 
specialty is kicky party clothes and his signature is the 
horizontal pleat 
born and raised in england the 28yearold designer speaks 
fluent polish learned in a polish school and from his parents who 
fled poland in the second world war 
my culture is from my family books music and art without 
doubt its a romanticized picture and some of that feeling comes 
out in my clothes said starzewski peering through stylish 
hornrimmed glasses and a thoroughly european cloud of cigarette

inspiration from the bedroom the ski slopes and 
the hunt ball is sparking the french fashion scene for next fall 
its also a nostalgic look back to the 1960s with reams of 
beautiful folklore prints from the likes of yves saint laurent and 
ungaro 
what was shown on the paris runways is not necessarily what will 
appear on the racks of your friendly local store even if youre in 
the thick of manhattan or ranging around malibu beach 
but smart shoppers keep in mind the novelties theyve seen as 
inspiration from this fashion capital 
sports are currently playing big in the fashion field as 
designers like gianfranco ferre of dior look to the hot colors of 
racecourse jockeys silks 
karl lagerfeld is current and past master of the fitted long 
jacket or redingote shortie coat over coltish long legs both for 
chanel and under his own label 
ferre too likes these sleek redingote coats often giving them 
an edwardian dash of elegance for dior with top hats and organza 
bows at the neck but the main sports inspirations are coming from 
the ski slopes and tour de france bicycle race with drawstring 
parkas and skintight shiny cycling shorts 
shown for next winter the shiny stretch biking gear is already 
a big hit on paris streets this summer usually worn by the 
under25 set older frenchwomen even though in top form usually 
have the good sense to dress rather more conservatively than their 
daughters and granddaughters even though they do aim to be elegant 
and sexy 
the current active sporting look adapted to street wear for the 
young comes out in short tights with long pantyhose or long 
stirrup stretch pants and jackets are allimportant they may be 
on the puffy taffeta side as shown by readytowear designers like 
jeancharles de castelbajac or versions of hooded drawstring 
windbreakers seen throughout all french collections these days 
at chanel designer karl lagerfeld likes to mix up the skislope 
wear and very rich fabrics and details his tiny minis and simply 
legs alone encased in tights with their hotcolored important 
toppers make for a youthful winter line 
chanellovers however are also looking to the new cruise line 
shown for next winter here it is very abbreviated but full of 
excellent details like beautifully cut short jackets round 
chanellogo buttons matching the outfits pearl chokers with beads 
larger than cherries and chaincircled buttonpearl earrings bigger 
than the ear itself and of course the tight shorts or currently 
fashionable pedal pushers are given the chanel fillip of big 
buttons up the side 
from the bedroom come some of the lateday ideas for next fall 
and winter touches of satin and lace give discreet sexy touches to 
luxury readytowear hanae mori the most parisian of japanese 
designers even brought out a line of dancehall merry widow 
styles gay enough for a toulouselautrec poster 
another influence for next winter is the enthusiastic embrace of 
folklore especially by leading designers like ungaro saint 
laurent and christian lacroix the creative lacroix never left the 
folklore camp he always shows a group of prints and silks inspired 
by his colorful provence home country and rich fabrics from 
byzantine and far eastern origin 
paris is now unveiling clothes yearround even between the big 
group shows 
recent outofseason showings included a quiet comeback from the 
house of rochas which had kept a very low profile with perfume 
and accessories only after the death of marcel rochas in 1955 
they hired an irishman named peter obrien who worked with marc 
bohan at dior and at chloe to refurbish the house image and bring 
out clothes with personality 
his clothes for next winter are an exercise in subtility in the 
highpriced category details are hautecouture style in the full 
and fitted gored long skirts satin lace and soft cashmere fabrics 
this is definitely understated chic says obrien who 
believes in autumnal colors to match the ladylike styles deep 
slate gray mustard burgundy pine or brick and autumnleaf red 
long and easy pants and very full skirts as shown for rochas may be 
beacons for whats to come in the next generation of fashion 
as paris has come through the sharp tailored looks the sexy 
minx styles and the return to 1960s minis it still seems 
floundering in whats due for the 1990s will the next decade of 
fashion be kinder and gentler to women 
as more styles fabrics and colors are being shown every season 
in the rush to be commercially successful it seems that women are 
freer than ever to choose gentle or tough chic

the italian challenge is to get into shape for a 
ruthless winter at least where fashion is concerned 
next winters italian hemline is so short that its average 
length plays around the thigh leaving no room for such weaknesses 
as plump legs or perish the thought chubby knees 
most fashion followers agree that the latest gianni versace 
microskirt whose hemline grazes the hip bone is just too short 
but at the same time his is the clearest statement that short 
skirts have definitely arrived 
the abbreviated hemline even creeps into fashionable night life 
with many elegant and sequined gowns anything but floorlength 
as if ultra short skirts werent demanding enough the winter 
fashion 19901991 italian style also is filled with sporty shorts 
and bermudas as well as bodyclinging rib knit jump suits all of 
which sorely tax those with anything but the perfect female figure 
the new winter bermudas and shorts are loose and sporty usually 
in corduroy or light wool jersey worn with dark or printed 
stockings and comfortable walking shoes 
on the whole the fallwinter readytowear moda milanese 
presented during the weeklong showings in milan which previewed 
what will soon appear in fashionable boutiques around the world is 
pert rather than sexy with a heavy accent on sportswear 
gone are the tailored city suits and classic coats of past 
winters replaced by sweatsuits sport jackets parkas down and 
duffel coats and loads of knitwear from cozy cardigans pullovers 
and sweater dresses to the brand new allknit jumpsuit 
to enoble its sporty thrust this years winter fashion uses 
lots of gold detailing both for day and night 
the new shape is the aline which appears in dresses and 
jackets alike in general shoulders are narrower although there 
is no need to throw away your shoulder pads 
jackets tend to be long and loose often ending where the skirt 
begins another danger signal for anyone but the wellproportioned 
models who adorn the glossy pages of fashion magazines 
there are plenty of trousers in the winter collections with the 
1950s pencil pants in light fabric or wool jersey the favorite 
style 
in the passementerie department there is abundant use of silk 
cording wool braiding frines and lace trimming 
fake fur usually cozy plush dyed and printed to resemble the 
real thing is used for both trimming and lining the designers 
also indulge in a variety of fake fur jackets and coats which are 
a must for anyone contemplating a fashionable ski vacation 
the favorite fabric for this winter is velour for both day and 
night 
although they have not given them up entirely the milan 
designers have looked beyond the drab browns grays and blacks of 
their industrial home town to draw inspiration for their color 
schemes from the bright shades of a new england fall landscape or 
the icy pastel shades of an early winter morning christmas red is 
the newest color 
however in their efforts to create fasttrack fashion for the 
young sporty and beautiful the italian designers seem to have 
forgotten the working woman offering almost no clothes she could 
wear to the office 
even such staid labels as genny and basile opted for the short 
hemlines and sporty parka leaving their career woman clients in a 
bind only giorgio armani and gianfranco ferre snubbed the 
miniskirt keeping their hemlines a discreet several inches above 
the knee but alas only executive level women can afford their 
price tags 
following in alphabetical order are a few tips of where to look 
for what 
armani exquisite daytime suits and the most feminine evening 
wear in delicate porcelain prints and beautiful embroidered velvet 
byblos cozy irish knit sweaters with gold and floral 
embroidery 
ferre the best in the gold look from sumptuous evening wear 
to oneofakind shimmering parkas 
genny suits where the jacket and the hemline of the skirt 
meet midway up the thigh 
krizia lots of cozy sweater dresses and sporty shorts 
missoni the best in reversible quilted duffel coats with 
multicolored knit prints inspired by russian folklore 
mario valentino bright tricolored shearling car coats 
versace the shortest skirt on sale and the best in the aline 
style

to wear fur or not to wear fur 
that is the question many new yorkers faced this last winter as 
animalrights activists mounted a major assault against the fur 
industry 
even as fur prices plunged and several retailers declared 
bankruptcy the battered furriers fought back round one has ended 
and both sides are claiming victory 
no question the animal rights groups have had a great deal to 
do with that decline declares george cave a national director 
for animal rights mobilization an animalrights group based in 
williamsport pa 
their tactic is to keep sales high but theyre driving prices 
way down to keep sales volume at the same level cave adds 
the movement has forced the issue to be in the media but it 
hasnt changed anybodys mind counters lili glassman a 
spokeswoman for saga furs an international fur marketing and trade 
association 
in fact the american fur industry has projected 1989 retail 
sales at 19 billion up from 186 billion for last season 
glassman says 
the fur industry has been in trouble but officials blame it on 
a worldwide glut of furs and warm winters in the united states and 
japan the two largest consumers of mink 
up until 1986 the fur business grew rapidly sales tripled in 
dollar volume according to glassman 
by 1987 farmers were overproducing and at the same time we had 
a stock market crash and the fur market slowed it was a natural 
correction glassman explains 
nevertheless the battle has been fierce 
antifur demonstrations were held across the nation especially 
on nov 25 a date designated by the animalrights movement as fur 
free friday 
that day bob barker host of the game show the price is 
right led 2500 protestors in a march down fifth avenue 
barker a longtime animalrights activist resigned as host of 
the miss usa pageant over its award of a fur to the winner 
four fur shops were vandalized in miami and fort lauderdale 
fla dozens of other cities were hit with protests including 
beverly hills ritzy shopping district 
the issue even went primetime when the television series la 
law aired a show that presented canadian trappers as brutes and 
showed animals being mangled in traps 
activists also adopted confrontational tactics there were 
reports of fur wearers being jeered at sprayed with ketchup or red 
paint and even having their coats slashed 
arm formerly known as transspecies unlimited says it doesnt 
condone violence 
it was a couple of isolated incidents cave says we dont 
advocate any kind of illegal activity 
the fur industry used the vandalism incidents for propaganda 
purposes and character assassination according to cave who says 
he believes the strategy backfired 
the fur industry also downplays the attacks on fur wearers 
there might have been a few incidents of spray painting more 
a scare tactic to make people think they might do it says 
glassman 
all this has changed the industrys promotional strategy to 
emphasize a fur wearers freedom of choice and the humane aspects 
of the industry 
when barker called the nations fur farms animal concentration 
camps fur farmers responded by saying that american fur farms 
receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals in the 
world 
an animals coat is a clear signal of wellbeing glassman 
said the animals must be taken care of very well in order to 
produce quality fur 
the industry also has attacked the animals rights activists as 
extremists who dont believe in using animals for anything 
including clothing meat entertainment and even aids research 
the fur industry is a matter of freedom of choice and these 
people want to take away their freedom of choice and their right to 
wear fur without intimidation says glassman 
round two is about to begin

fur real or just fur fun everything from sable to 
fake lamb is part of paris style 
no matter that winters have been warm for several seasons 
driving some furriers out of business the top furriers and 
couturiers are doing well with the real thing and with fakes 
the french take a sanguine view of furs and they dont throw 
stones at wearers of mink or fox on the street here although the 
use of endangered species does raise some ecological eyebrows 
real furs have never looked more appealing particularly at yves 
saint laurent whose collection was designed by robert merloz 
thinking mink means designers are giving it new fillips 
relegating more conventional styles to grandmas closet merloz 
made a hit at the saint laurent winter show by shaping trapeze 
styles and shortie trench coats in watered silk poplin or taffeta 
then lining them with lamb or mink 
he also put fun into furs by draping sable mink or chinchilla 
coats with ribbons decorative though not particularly useful in a 
snowstorm diors top designer gianfranco ferre also sees new 
ways to use fur often featuring a pyramidshaped coat whether in 
chinchilla or blackgama mink combined with lace to make dressy 
reversible coats ferres wayout look for persian lamb was to dye 
it pink and gray in flower patterns 
endangering no species at all ferre also came out with 
spottedcat furs made from dyed lamb and his most amusing use of 
astrakhan was to pattern it like chevron tweed for sharp blazers 
former dior fur designer frederic castet opened up a new shop in 
the fashion district on rue pierre charron this year and came out 
with an opulent collection of sportswear starring leather and furs 
though a past master of dying and patterning minks and sables 
this time castet outdid himself in a stunning finale long minks 
dyed with homages to various countries a statue of liberty for 
america and an eiffel tower for france 
but castets real coup was a soft and silky new fake fur he 
calls castiss invented he said to show his concern for 
ecological matters this usually looked appealingly soft and white 
and came out in everything from duffel coats to sweeping longer 
fitted numbers 
another furrier whose original ideas are attracting attention is 
georges constant whose grandfather started the family firm of 
alexandre 
im doing quite well overall he said even in just 
natural ranch mink jackets and coats 
but he also loves to play around some women found his painted 
minktail long reversible jackets irresistible one one side are 
the black mink tails in chevron patterns on the other a flowery 
pattern using both the tails as outlines and painted details on the 
leather exterior 
he not only uses all the conventional furs including lamb 
chinchilla sable and beaver but hes elated over a new soft fur 
from a new hybrid animal called an orylag 
as constant describes it the orylag is a kind of superrabbit 
which im responsible for helping breeders create and on which i 
have a patent for the first years of production 
the fur is light soft dyeable and looks a lot like nutria a 
far more expensive fur constant makes terrific little evening 
shrugs as well as longer dressy jackets out of orylag 
in many bigname couture and readytowear houses fakes are 
taking the upper hand of the fur scene jeancharles castelbajac 
has always been known for his ecological approach to clothes 
design and says i wouldnt dream of using real furs having been 
revolted by what i saw at a fox farm once 
but he adores using plushtype fakes for his duffel coats 
cuddly teddybear sweaters and jackets and he recently brought out 
a line of warm clothes with furry linings made just like french 
concierges slippers 
jeanlouis scherrer is perennially crazy about wildanimal skin 
themes but he usually puts them on silk fabrics and has hardly 
ever used the real thing 
i love fake furs too and dont believe in using genuine 
fur says erik mortensen the couture designer for the house of 
balmain his sleek spotted coats and fake fur trim look so real 
they could set off ecological protests 
but while the sane and sound fashionable fakes are indeed less 
expensive than sable or fox they are hardly bargainbasement 
stuff 
my coats indeed cost several thousand dollars said 
castelbajac i want to make quality and even though the furs are 
not real i want them to evoke luxury and a dream good fashion is 
always something out of the ordinary

a campaign to encourage consumers to buy 
americanmade clothes has begun to pay off according to an 
industry group formed to offset the impact of imports on the 
fashion industry 
this is more than just pocketbook patriotism it reflects 
american consumers preference for usmade clothings quality 
style and fit a preference that is also evident in many foreign 
cultures says robert e swift executive director of the crafted 
with pride in usa council a nonprofit industry marketing group 
formed six years ago 
swift points to a study made by the good housekeeping institute 
which showed that 80 percent of the women interviewed rated 
americanmade clothing as the best quality on the market another 
study by a market research firm r h bruskin associates showed 
similar approval with 87 percent of its sampling and time 
magazinecnn research shows an 82 percent rating a survey by 
cambridge reports indicates that the number of us consumers who 
say they have not purchased a specific product because it was 
foreignmade has nearly doubled in the last four years 
when the council coordinated made in the usa promotions 
with retailers like belks in charlotte the jones store in kansas 
city several dillards locations in the southwest the may company 
in cleveland and los angeles and thalhimers in richmond sales 
increases ranged up to 18 percent according to swift 
he estimates that 350000 jobs in the us apparel industry have 
been lost in the past decade due to imports and he says studies 
which indicate a turnaround are good news to textile and apparel 
makers 
dr michelle morganosky of the university of illinois school of 
human resources and family studies says a study she conducted shows 
that stores promoting usmade merchandise are perceived by 
consumers as being higher quality than those associated with 
imported merchandise 
america is rebuilding its reputation for producing quality 
merchandise like never before says virginia wagesplotkin 
coowner of down home america a boutique sportwear merchandiser 
weve retooled our thinking about quality design productivity

american consumers buy denim jeans at an estimated 13 pairs per 
second and these ubiquitous blues have become a major 
international fashion category spotlighted on the runways and in 
the boutiques of new york paris rome london and tokyo 
and unlike so much other high fashion wear this fabric first 
made in the middle ages at the french textile town of nimes de 
nimes should be washed not drycleaned say most fabric 
manufacturers 
denim is one of the strongest fabrics around and will not tear 
or show signs of wear after many washings real denim is 100 
percent cotton with indigo blue dye that definitely will fade most 
denims today are relatively shrinkproof with sanforizing for 
sanforset or by blending the cotton with polyester 
laundering techniques to get the special look you want for your 
jeans are outlined by specialists at the maytag company 
for brand new blue denim wash with soap or detergent in warm 
water and tumble dry both on the regular fabric cycle dry at 
moderate temperature setting and dont overdry since that can 
cause wrinkles to set or encourage shrinkage the indigo dyes 
will fade during laundering so extremely dark denim should be 
washed separately or washed with other deeply dyed items 
to fade deep blue denims use one cup of liquid chlorine 
bleach in the laundry water taking care to dilute it with four 
parts of water to be added to the washer after agitation has 
started the liquid bleach dispenser on your washing machine also 
can be used for this purpose repeat this process until you get the 
fade you like 
to care for acid or stonewashed denim wash in warm water 
with soap or detergent using the gentle machine setting and tumble 
dry on moderate heat 
the only exception to the nodrycleaning rule is when the jeans 
are trimmed with certain kinds of appliques sequins leather or 
other decorations that cant be laundered 
each denim item you buy for your wardrobe will have a care label 
sewn in since by law these labels must be attached to all clothing 
sold in the united states

denim has a long history here are some highlights culled by 
levi strauss amp co 
this tightly woven fabric was first made during the middle 
ages in the french textile town of nimes it first was called 
serge de nimes later shortened to de nimes and finally to 
denim 
early sailors from genoa italy characteristically wore pants 
made of denim and these became known as genes later adapted 
to jeans 
the sailors from dhunga india also wore denim pants theirs 
were called dhungarees now dungarees 
denim was used for the sails of the nina pinta and santa 
maria when columbus fleet sailed to the new world 
american jeans became popular during the california gold rush 
when a young immigrant levi strauss arrived too late for the 
gold he decided to make heavyduty pants for the miners who 
complained they couldnt find clothing to withstand the rigors of 
their work

wealthy and discriminating male shoppers have 
known the zegna name for decades members of european royal 
families and affluent asian businessmen have zegna suits in their 
wardrobes 
the italian clothier hopes to capitalize on its cachet by 
opening its first american store on manhattans fifth avenue it 
will join a half dozen other zegna stores located at the right 
ritzy addresses in foreign fashion capitals 
by venturing into us retailing zegna wants to drum up more 
interest in its label the goal is to boost business for zegna 
merchandise sold around the country at upscale department stores 
such as neimanmarcus and tony boutiques including ultimo in 
chicago and san franciscos wilkes bashford 
zegna pronounced to rhyme with kenya will be following the 
examples of classy lines like burberrys chanel hermes louis 
vuitton and others that increased american consumer awareness of 
their goods by opening stores here 
we like to think of ourselves in the same ilk as those 
companies says richard cohen president of ermenegildo zegna 
usa the italian groups american arm 
the timing isnt perfect to launch into retailing middleofthe 
road retailers have fallen by the wayside as specialty merchants 
have made inroads into their business still cohen is confident 
high quality goods he says have what it takes to attract 
customers even in tough times you continue to do well in bad 
economic times because youre offering value for money 
luxury retailers arent immune to problems if increasing numbers 
of consumers convert to more conservative buying habits but luxury 
really never goes out of style among people with loads of money who 
view every purchase even a new suit as an investment notes 
john mincarelli a professor at the fashion institute of technology 
in new york 
whats happened is were finding custom tailoring is becoming 
a status symbol again says mincarelli it always was but now 
its more prevalent 
mens fashion guru alan flusser an author designer and store 
owner believes a revival has begun in madetomeasure suits 
as prices of mens clothes have risen precipitously the 
difference between a good readymade suit and a good custommade 
suit has narrowed flusser says the custommade suit has had a 
rennaissance in this country 
indicating that a trend has developed more retailers and 
manufacturers with retail outlets are upgrading their tailoring 
services some bring their fabrics and samples to offices for 
customers too busy for instore shopping the ranks of these 
haberdashers who make house calls has expanded recently and include 
such mainstream quality clothing makers as hartmarx 
zegna will offer roving tailors too the fitters will visit 
offices and elsewhere to accomodate customers needing to be 
measured for alterations on readymade clothing or for custommade 
suits the store will schedule private appointments for afterhours 
customers 
at the top of the scale a madetomeasure suit will retail at 
an average price of around 1500 a customers measurements will 
be faxed to italy where all the work will be done delivery is 
promised in four weeks 
the zegna store will stock offtherack suits ranging from 900 
to 1500 with free alterations done on the premises if thats too 
pricey for someone keen to buy into the zegna image there will be 
casual shirts for 60 to 65 and casual slacks for 225 to 250 
ties go for about 85 
ermenegildo zegna named for his grandfather who built the 
business and known simply as gildo says much of what makes the 
company special is that it is still run by the founding family the 
company based in trivero italy oversees the production of the 
wool and other raw materials that zegna weaves into fabrics that 
become clothing

everyday clothes for children 
like their elders youngsters can wear status stonewashed jeans 
and jackets with a countrywestern flavor for example guess kids

a pair of cowboy boots from justin boot company can add an

them have cartoon and happy face lace tips from brookside

the rugged motif for fall may look good on the outside but how 
does it feel on the inside 
manufacturers are seeking ways to blend the rough and ready 
with the comfortable in parkas field jackets and carcoats 
manmade fiberfill insulations can provide the wearer with 
warmth and comfort from the inside out says don ziesel du pont 
marketing manager who sees coats with a rugged attitude among 
the most popular looks this fall he says the synthetic insulations 
not only drape well for the designer but they help keep the 
wearer warm and dry 
some activewear from hellyhansen is lined with hydrofil nylon 
mesh which draws moisture away from the body to prevent wet cling 
according to its manufacturer allied fibers 
recently fabric and fiber technology has come a long way 
says du ponts ziesel manmade insulations such as thermoloft 
and thermolite aid designers in creating innovative jackets and 
coats that consumers will find more exciting then ever before 
fall colors for outerwear he says are woodsy ranging from 
earth tones of olive and brown to shades of berry mustard and 
mango

the old saw about suffering in the name of 
fashion has real significance with todays styles says dr leonard 
w morgan assistant professor of family medicine at the university 
of oklahoma health sciences center 
waistcinching belts tightfitting jeans and tight shirt 
collars can cause or aggravate health problems he says by far the 
worst offenders are shoes 
people buy shoes for style not for comfort frequently the 
shoes are too narrow have inadequate cushioning in the soles or 
are illfitting this can lead to everything from tired feet corns 
and calluses to serious foot problems that require surgery 
closefitting garments also cause problems tight clothes 
interfere with blood circulation to the skin tootight shirt 
collars and ties can interfere somewhat with blood flow to the 
brain for people who already have arteriosclerosis which is 
impeded blood flow to the brain tight collars and ties can 
increase their risk of problems says morgan similarly 
kneehigh hose or tight socks can contribute to development of 
varicose veins he adds 
summer or winter people should try to protect themselves from 
the sun there is no such thing as a healthy tan the rays of 
the sun are quite damaging as the rising incidence of skin cancer 
proves he says he thinks most people make their worst clothing 
mistakes in the summer dark closefitting clothing traps warmth 
and can contribute to heat stroke he advises people to choose 
light colors in loosefitting styles to allow airflow next to the 
skin

the owner of a mobile home park for 
retirees who frowns on unmarried couples living together has 
launched a legal battle he hopes will turn the clock back 100 years 
this case could lead to the reemergence of an extremely old 
and valuable principle the family said peter hooper lawyer 
for romany mobile home park 
the case could affect all the fairhousing laws in florida said 
gloria williams president of the florida association of community 
relations professionals 
hooper represents william watson a quiet man in his early 60s 
who refers inquiries to his attorney i dont mean to be 
discourteous but talk to my lawyer i dont want to put my foot in 
my mouth 
hes asking the courts if an 1868 state law against lewd and 
lascivious cohabitation is grounds to evict unmarried old couples 
who stay together in the same trailer hooper said lewd and 
lascivious is a general legal term that does not necessarily mean 
depravity and could apply to common sexual activity 
watson also wants a pinellas county judge to decide whether the 
state law renders unconstitutional local fairhousing laws 
forbidding discrimination based on marital status 
hooper who is negotiating the case with the city and county 
believes officials have no choice but to stand behind state law 
until it is removed or altered 
the dispute meanwhile has caused a stir in the sleepy 96site 
park where residents 55 and older pedal around the wellkept 
grounds on tricycles more than half spend winters here returning 
to cooler climes to escape the summer 
i believe its immoral for people not married to live 
together said bernice ulrey a native of indianapolis who has 
lived at the park since 1964 
it doesnt matter to me said a balding whitehaired man 
from pontiac mich who wouldnt give his name tenants are told 
the rules mean no overnight stays for unmarrieds he said adding 
what can you do at night that you cant do during the day 
hooper calls the situation a catch 22 on one hand state law 
bans cohabitation but city and county law bans discrimination 
based on marital status 
the problem isnt unique to this central gulf coast community 
hooper said 
most states have the same conflicts in laws they differ in 
degree and detail its a clash of new thoughts with old 
principles he said 
some think the key to the case is in the interpretation of lewd 
and lascivious conduct 
that is really something you wouldnt know unless you looked 
through the windows said james yates director of human 
relations for the city 
hooper disagrees he thinks the terms could apply to an 
unmarried couple living together 
the city ordinance contains an exemption allowing a landlord to 
refuse to rent to an unmarried couple yates said this was added 
at the behest of ministers 
but the county has no such exemption 
its the countys stand in this day and time we dont consider 
cohabitation between two consenting adults to be lewd and 
lascivious behavior said robert reece of the pinellas county 
office of human rights 
robert herman a 65yearold retiree who shared a mobile home 
with his wife until she died three years ago is among the 
residents upset with the lawsuit 
he is passing moral judgment on me herman said recently 
before heading back to summer in new jersey herman said he was 
told by watsons son he must sell his home lease it or marry his 
girlfriend 
hes assuming that things are happening here said herman 
my client isnt shooting at any individual hooper said 
hes sued the city and the county because they deserve it they 
passed those ordinances that muddied the water 
there are others who endorse watsons effort were behind the 
manager 100 percent said oscar bray a retiree from the ann 
arbor mich area 
an assistant pinellas county attorney bill falker said watson 
assumes that people who are unrelated and living together are 
committing lewd and lascivious acts i dont know if we can make 
that assumption it certainly doesnt seem so to me 
according to the florida state archives the 122yearold law 
states that if any man and woman not being married to each 
other lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together 
they shall be guilty 
the legislature amended the law in 1971 and changed the maximum 
penalty from up to three years in prison to one year in prison and 
a 500 fine 
hooper sued on march 11 the parties have been involved in 
negotiations that hooper hopes will lead to a settlement without 
trial he wont disclose contents of the talks 
watsons 43yearold son jerry who helps manage the park 
shares his fathers feelings and is proud of what he is doing 
its the way we were brought up its the right way to act 
he said hes standing up for his beliefs

the older americans act marks its 25th 
anniversary next year and already is being used to call attention 
to a law that underpins the growing network of social services for 
the nations elderly 
on capitol hill where the act is widely viewed as a success 
story that has enhanced the independence and dignity of older 
americans congress is preparing to do some fine tuning for the 
laws 1991 reauthorization 
but some supporters of improved aid to senior citizens say they 
are concerned that president bush has yet to call the 1991 white 
house conference on aging regarded as a onceinadecade spur to 
improving the nations care network for the elderly 
in a letter to bush late last year members of the senate select 
committee on aging urged him to call the conference and focus it on 
longterm care for vulnerable people of all ages 
since then sen david pryor dark the committee chairman 
and sen john heinz rpa have introduced a resolution calling on 
the president to move on the issue 
i am perplexed and disturbed at the presidents delay in 
calling this important conference pryor said 
the first white house conference on aging held in 1961 is 
credited for laying the groundwork for the medicaid program 
adopted four years later conferences have been held every decade 
since with the aim of providing a look forward at the needs of the 
aging population 
congress last took a comprehensive look at the problems of the 
elderly in 1987 when it overwhelmingly approved a fouryear 68 
billion reauthorization of the older americans act 
the act provides funds for senior centers meals on wheels 
transportation for the elderly legal assistance health programs 
adult day care counseling employment opportunities and programs 
for the frail elderly at home and for older americans in nursing 
homes 
of the acts many achievements none is greater than the 
establishment of an aging network of committed federal state and 
local agencies as well as service providers dedicated to 
providing desperately needed social services to our nations 
elderly pryor said 
pryors committee has begun a series of workshops examining 
issues and options as work begins on the reauthorization of the 
basic law 
two leading issues under discussion include 
the possibility of voluntary costsharing for the recipients 
of such services as meals on wheels who can afford it some worry 
this might lead to the establishment of a means test or to 
distorting basic services with those able to pay receiving a 
higher quality of service than those who are not 
information and referral creating a system to link people in 
need with existing services 
pror will hold workshops next week to explore the possibility of 
improvements in legal services for the elderly and in the existing 
system of ombudsmen who field complaints from senior citizens about 
the quality of services they receive 
representatives from state and local ombudsmens programs will 
examine such questions as whether the program should be expanded 
how to recruit competent personnel and what barriers exist to 
doing an effective job 
the program was added to the act by congress in 1978 to help 
resolve the complaints of residents in nursing homes and other care 
facilities 
pryors committee also plans to examine the effectiveness of the 
us commission on the aging the prime coordinating group for 
government services for the elderly 
i intend to make concrete proposals designed to improve and 
strengthen a number of services funded by the older americans 
act pryor said these include transportation information and 
referral ombudsmen legal services and nutrition programs 
as the time approaches for making changes in the older americans 
act suggestions also are coming from representatives of the 
private organizations with interest in the elderly and their 
problems 
the national association of area agencies on aging says it is 
coordinating a campaign to increase federal programs complaining 
that a decline in spending over the decade has led to a gradual 
reduction of services and longer waiting lists 
the national council on aging is urging congress to earmark at 
least 20 million to expand nutrition and exercise classes 
information on the safe use of medication and meals featuring 
lowfat highfiber foods 
daniel thursz the councils president told a house human 
services subcommittee earlier this year that effective and 
widespread health promotion services would reduce the growth of 
funds being spent for treatment of health problems 
he complained that the 5 million authorized for such services 
when the older americans act was renewed in 1987 has not yet been 
spent what is tragic is that thousands of centers are offering 
useful but thin preventive health services to the nations most 
atrisk population he said 
but even before formal consideration of amendments to the older 
americans act pryor is working to make some changes 
for example a pryor amendment to the national affordable 
housing act is aimed at providing services for elderly tenants in 
federally assisted housing 
with modest forms of support services such as hot meals and 
help with basic home care needs including bathing dressing and 
grooming these people can continue to live in the setting they 
consider home pryor said

author alex haley told stories of his days 
growing up in tennessee doctors warned about alzheimers disease 
and prescription drugs and former congresswoman shirley chisholm 
expressed hope for george bush 
speakers touched on a range of issues at the biennial convention 
of the american association of retired persons earlier this month 
ms chisholm the first black woman elected to congress in 
1968 said bush is not as doctrinaire and inflexible as ronald 
reagan was but hes just a little too cautious on some things 
he watches to see which way the political winds blow he needs to 
be a little more brave 
some of the 15000 delegates attending the sessions in orlando 
heard one doctor assure senior citizens that the minddeteriorating 
alzheimers disease was not inevitable another physician warned 
the greatest preventable health problem is caused by 
prescription drugs 
and haley author of the novel roots spoke movingly and 
humorously about growing up in a small tennessee town where he 
recalled his grandmother and her five sisters sitting and rocking 
dipping into their tobacco and taking practice shots off the 
front porch 
aunt liz was the champion haley said of their spitting 
contests when she was in good form aunt liz could drop a 
lightning bug at four yards 
dr sidney m wolfe director of the public citizen health 
research group warned the elderly that they could seriously harm 
or kill themselves unless they pay careful attention to the 
prescription drugs theyre taking 
all drugs have side effects you need to be aware of them 
especially if taking several medications at the same time or if 
getting prescriptions from more than one physician he said 
wolfe whose research and lobbying group was founded by consumer 
activist ralph nader in 1971 criticized the aarp for not setting 
up a system to advise members about the quality of the different 
drugs it sells 
the aarp sells 150 million worth of drugs a year it 
should recommend some and steer people away from some that are 
dangerous or no good wolfe said 
the organization sells its members prescription and 
nonprescription drugs at a discount by mail 
dr robert n butler who heads the department of geriatrics at 
the mount sinai medical center in new york told a large seminar 
audience that he was concerned that the medical profession had 
overly worried the elderly about alzheimers disease 
it is awful it is tragic it kills many people but in 
our zealousness weve scared a lot of people butler said but 
thats also happened with cancer and other major diseases 
he said much research was under way and much more was needed in 
investigating a disease caused by a number of factors including 
heredity the bodys chemical makeup and immune systems 
environmental toxins and others 
eventually butler predicted medical research will find ways to 
control or prevent the disabling brain disease meanwhile he said 
the government should create a new medicare category for patients 
needing longterm care 
individuals can enjoy a certain quality of life at different 
levels of alzheimers disease he said there is real hope for 
the introduction of new therapies within our lifetimes 
aarp is a nonprofit organization open to anyone age 50 or 
older working or retired of its 32 million members an estimated 
onethird are older workers officials said 
based in washington dc it provides programs for members and 
is an active lobbying force in congress it devotes much of its 
resources to campaigns involving affordable health care protecting 
the rights of the elderly in the work force and minority and 
womens affairs

there was a time when alice faye was queen of 
the 20th century fox musicals 
it was great it was glamorous it was wonderful i dont 
spend too much time thinking about it but when i do it was 
lovely i had so many nice friends people who were good to me i 
didnt have too many beefs many complaints she said 
i have great memories of the working people wonderful stars 
like don ameche john payne tyrone power jack oakie jack haley 
on and on we had so much fun we really did they dont seem to 
have that kind of fun today 
now she has produced a book growing old staying young 
ep dutton 1895 written with dick kleiner still a striking 
blonde at 75 she also has been spokeswoman for pfizer 
pharmaceuticals 
i go out every month almost she says i travel a day i 
rest a day then i work two days and i come home it works out real 
nice its kind of fun it keeps me active keeps me involved and 
keeps me off the street 
her book contains the message faye imparts to her audiences 
whom she calls young elders the faye method 
1 staying active and involved 
2 eating a wellbalanced diet 
3 no smoking which is tough for a lot of people 
4 exercising thats a key walking swimming stretching 
5 seeing your doctor and talking to him about your problems 
i throw in 6 please god have a sense of humor because it 
helps 
she enjoys meeting fans who recall her films of the 30s and 
40s all of them have a story to tell you they had a baby at 
the time i did this movie or i sang that song she said 
faye was born alice jeanne leppert daughter of a new york 
police officer a teenage beauty who danced in the capitol theater 
chorus at 14 she eventually made her way to hollywood 
for 10 years she starred in a string of popular musicals sing 
baby sing stowaway with shirley temple on the avenue 
alexanders ragtime band sally irene and mary rose of 
washington square lillian russell weekend in havana and 
more 
faye seldom watches her old movies on television i was never 
a fan of me but she saw one recently that she remembered 
fondly the wonderfully slapstick hollywood cavalcade 1939 
i really enjoyed seeing that one again she said i had 
forgotten how funny buster keaton was he was a genius who never 
got his due in hollywood 
she has less pleasant memories of her relations with studio boss 
darryl zanuck 
i wanted to do something more mature but zanuck didnt see it 
that way she said they were making lots of money with 
pictures that betty grable and myself were doing all those 
musicals always it was the same story we changed costumes and 
leading men and off wed go and make another one 
the only chance i had for a dramatic role was fallen angel 
1945 that was a good meaty part but when i finally saw it on 
the screen i was on the cutting room floor 
faye was a victim of the bigstudio era when stars were 
pigeonholed her musicals were a studio staple so zanuck refused 
to change the formula until fallen angel a boxoffice failure 
because of zanucks cuts no one will ever know whether faye could 
have succeeded in drama 
and faye left she never went back 
she and her husband starred for a decade on their toprated 
radio program the alice fayephil harris show she was a 
frequent guest on television and returned to fox for the 1962 
musical version of state fair with a score by rodgers and 
hammerstein in more recent times she toured in good news 
first with john payne and then with don ameche 
for many years faye and her husband have lived in rancho mirage

contrary to expectations the abuser of 
an older person tends to be dependent on that person for money or 
housing said a social worker who is trying to increase awareness 
of the problem 
we have a long way to go educating police attorneys and 
doctors said kathleen skoglund a supervisor in the sioux falls 
office of adult services and aging 
she spoke at a workshop last month on protective services for 
older people as part of the 11th annual gerontology forum in sioux 
falls stella bergin education director of the sioux falls senior 
citizens services office for 14 years said the forum was started 
in part because south dakota is among the nations leaders in the 
percentage of older people in its population 
us census figures for 1988 ranked south dakota as the 
seventholdest state with 14 percent of its population over 65 
florida was the oldest 178 percent followed by iowa and 
pennsylvania both 149 then rhode island arkansas and west 
virginia 
a congressional report issued last month said an estimated 15 
million older americans or 5 percent of all elderly are abused 
each year up from 1 million in 1980 only one in eight cases is 
reported according to estimates 
south dakota has about 120000 older residents skoglund said 
and last year fewer than 300 cases of abuse were reported 168 
were substantiated she said 
abuse can be physical psychological passive neglect 
selfneglect exploitation and abuse of power by professional 
caregivers skoglund said studies show elderly abuse primarily is 
inflicted by a relative most commonly spouses followed by sons 
and daughters 
skoglund said studies she has seen most of them done from 1982 
to 1988 also show that what has been thought to be the main cause 
of abuse caregiver stress really isnt most abuse has been 
found to be inflicted by people who depend on the older person 
one study showed that twothirds of the perpetrators were 
financially dependent on the victim she said fiftyfive 
percent were dependent on them for housing 
studies also have shown that those inflicting abuse usually have 
a drug or alcohol problem have a history of arrests are disabled 
or cognitively impaired or have suffered a recent loss of some 
kind skoglund said 
so you have a case where a vulnerable needy person is abusing 
a more vulnerable needy person she said 
south dakota has had five laws on elderly abuse on its books 
since 1986 and two more take effect july 1 by 1987 all states 
had laws governing abuse of older people and several states 
require reporting including florida skoglund said

tohono oodham iitois named after a deity 
are tiny multiplier onions cultivated in the arid southwest for 
centuries 
no one seems sure where they originated but they grow easily in 
desert gardens with a minimum of water and can remain in the ground 
for harvesting year after year the flavor something like a 
shallot is a delight in salads or cooked foods 
do such heirloom crops have a future role in a watershort era 
native seedssearch a nonprofit seed conservation group 
incorporated in 1983 is sure of it 
its seed bank at the tucson botanical garden includes more than 
1000 varieties of grains beans melons spices squash and other 
crops supplies of many are now sufficient to offer for sale in a 
1990 catalog which says we invite you to join us in maintaining 
these crops 
the genetic erosion in southwest crops began around 1920 with 
the emergence of mechaniclal irrigation methods 
increased water supplies temporarily lessened the need for 
droughthardy locally adapted varieties gary paul nabhan 
assistant director of phoenixs desert botanical garden and 
president of native seeds board of directors said in a talk to an 
ethnobotany symposium 
since the regions water problems have again deepened 
interest has been renewed in using remaining native crops directly 
or as a plant breeding material 
preserving the seed genes selected by generations of desert 
farmers led to formation of native seedssearch search is an 
acronym for southwestern endangered aridland resource clearing 
house as of january there were almost 2500 members 
the usual reason given for preserving genes of plants is they 
someday may be needed to make cultivated crops pest or 
diseaseresistant the irish potato famine after crop failures 
often is cited 
to such concerns native seeds adds ecological considerations 
such as drought and heat tolerance and suggests certain crops may 
help in control of some nutritional diseases 
nabhan now on sabbatical from the desert botanical garden is 
reasearching native food plants with gummy fibers and mucilages 
that may be useful in control of diabetes diabetes has increased 
greatly among sothwest indians in recent years and some scientists 
blame a diet change from traditional foods 
so the reasons people join native seedssearch can be varied 
but the seed catalog must be high on the list interested in trying 
to grow hopi blue corn its available so is the chiapas wild 
tomato with sweet and flavorful cherrysize fruit 
and of course the tohono oodham iitois which are best

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a

for its 1986 challenges to two proposed mergers of soft drink 
companies 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that royal crown 
is not entitled to be reimbursed for the lawyer fees it incurred in 
fighting the lateraborted mergers 
in early 1986 pepsico inc announced its plan to acquire the 
sevenup co from philip morris inc for 380 million 
the cocacola co then announced its intent to acquire dr 
pepper co for 470 million 
believing its existence threatened royal crown in june 1986 
sued in a federal court in georgia to block the mergers 
four days later the federal trade commission asked a federal 
court in the district of columbia to block cocacolas takeover of 
dr pepper 
the commission did not challenge the sevenup acquisition by 
pepsico because efforts to complete that transaction already had 
been abandoned 
us district judge j robert elliott in columbus ga awarded 
royal crown coal 14 million in lawyer fees under a federal 
antitrust law provision for such awards to a prevailing party 
the atlantabased 11th us circuit court of appeals reversed 
the award last nov 13 
royal crown filed a precautionary lawsuit and started the 
litigation wheels moving after much of the desired information had 
already been produced to the ftc the appeals court said such 
action is neither swift nor decisive and it is not enough to confer 
upon royal crown the status of a prevailing party

the supreme court today left intact an 8 
million antitrust award against blue cross and blue shield of 
kansas 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that the 
medical insurance company was trying only to cut costs not 
interfere with competition when it ended a contract with the 
largest hospital in wichita 
blue cross said the award should be overturned in light of a may 
14 high court ruling that said pricecutting schemes that hurt a 
competitors business do not necessarilly violate federal antitrust 
laws 
the may ruling said that only when pricecutting can be proved 
to be predatory when prices are set below cost does it violate 
the sherman antitrust act 
in the case acted on today the 10th us circuit court of 
appeals last march upheld the 8 million judgment against blue 
cross the company was sued by wesley medical center the largest 
hospital in wichita health care plus inc wichitas major health 
maintenance organization and new century life insurance co 
blue cross ended its contract with wesley in 1986 and agreed 
instead to purchase hospital services in wichita from st francis 
regional medical center and st josephs medical center 
the suit against blue cross alleged that the termination was due 
to wesleys acquisition by hospital corporation of america hca 
which is based in nashville 
wesley officials said blue cross alarmed over hcas growing 
importance was sending a message to other hospitals that they 
would suffer a loss of business if they were acquired by the 
corporation or did business with blue crosss competitors 
blue cross said it signed up with the other two hospitals in 
return for a 20 percent reduction in hospital prices 
the 10th circuit court said the jury believed those suing blue 
cross who said the insurer tried to restrict consumers access to 
and benefits from rival health care financing arrangements 
the case is blue cross vs reazin 891839

caterpillar inc today announced its 1990 
earnings will be far below last year due mainly to a dramatic 
decline in the performance of its brazilian operations 
we have a serious shortterm negative problem in brazil 
said richard e stober caterpillar spokesman 
the peoriabased construction equipment manufacturer earned 497 
million in 1989 down 19 percent from 1988s 616 million last 
years profits lagged despite revenue of 111 billion 
stober said caterpillar expects its sales and revenue to match 
the 1989 record although sales volume will be lower higher prices 
will compensate for the drop in product sales stober said 
according to caterpillars projections the companys sixmonth 
earnings will be less than 148 million and on pace for a sharp 
drop from 1989 
more than half of the revision is due to brazil stober 
said our sales there have continued relatively strong but 
the government has frozen all the prices and it appears we will be 
selling at a loss for the year in brazil 
caterpillar employs 5100 of its 60000member worldwide 
workforce at two plants in brazil workers there build gas diesel 
and marine engines generator sets winches as well as an 
assortment of wheel loaders tractor scrapers bull dozers 
rippers motor graders and tracktype tractors 
caterpillars latin american territory which includes mexico 
central america and south america bought 447 million of equipment 
manufactured at the companys us factories 
in addition caterpillar sold 382 million in equipment made in 
latin america 
other factors contributing to caterpillars slide include tight 
us monetary policies and higher inflation stober said 
also a plant modernization program is taking longer than 
expected and is costing more than projected he said

the american invasion of switzerlands chocolate 
industry has left a bitter taste among some swiss pioneers of the 
confection and statistically its biggest eaters 
comments have been ranging from sadness to indignation in the 
wake of philip morris companies incs announced 38 billion 
acquisition of jacobs suchard makers of the two top swiss brand 
names toblerone and milka 
throughout this century toblerone with its typical triangular 
shape and violetwrapped milka have been synonyms of 
schokoladenschweiz chocolate switzerland 
it is almost as if a swiss entrepreneur would buy ford the 
weekly zurich sonntagszeitung editorialized after philip morris 
the worlds biggest consumer products conglomerate announced it 
would buy the worlds third biggest chocolate and coffee group 
milka cow is grazing on marlboro ranch headlined the basler 
zeitung in reference to one of philip morris cigarette brands 
and at toblerones hometown of bern the bund newspaper predicted 
popular indignation at the loss of this piece of switzerland 
will be great 
although toblerone and milka continue to be made in 
switzerland they will be part of an anonymous conglomerate with 
controls in the united states it stated 
even the staid zurich financial newspaper finanz und 
wirtschaft said the takeover would stir strong emotions 
emotions are not cooled by the fact that suchards owner klaus 
jacobs is a native of germany polls consistently show that 
germans are switzerlands least loved neighbors 
jacobs was the first foreigner to move into the swiss chocolate 
industry which is one of the worlds leading chocolate exporters 
sales last year totaled about 40000 tons to more than 130 
countries with another 60000 tons consumed domestically 
the swiss reputation in the field chocolate rivals watches 
cheese and bank secrecy as the countrys chief image makers dates 
to the early 19th century 
francoislouis cailler and philippe suchard began the worlds 
industrial production of chocolate another breakthrough came in 
the 1870s when daniel peter invented the milk chocolate bar and 
rodolphe lindt refined the product so that it melted on the tongue 
dario kuster director of chocosuisse the union of swiss 
chocolate manufacturers said in an interview monday that the swiss 
also were the first to push exports 
at the turn of the century they had an enormous lead he 
said up to 70 percent of the swiss production was sold abroad 
while foreign manufacturers focused on their domestic markets 
before world war i when other countries increasingly set up 
import barriers many swiss subsidiaries sprang up abroad 
an early awareness of what we now call marketing was a second 
important factor kuster said posters and ads were widely used 
already in the 19th century 
toblerone became a pacesetter in 1908 it registered with the 
federal intellectual property office and remains the only swiss 
chocolate that is patented 
it has become a special hit kuster said perhaps because 
the shape brings to mind the matterhorn or perhaps a whole range 
of untouched mountains 
swiss chocolate seems a must buy of even the most dietconscious 
tourists visiting switzerland they often claim that chocolate made 
in switzerland tastes better than the same brand made by a 
subsidiary abroad 
there is a good part of imagination involved said kuster 
but its true that the mix of cocoa beans the choice of milk 
and of course the swiss pride in quality are also factors 
switzerland supposedly is the biggest consumer at 25 pounds per 
capita annually but the figure may be misleading because it 
includes purchases by tourists in switzerland 
swiss sales abroad are in the quality range he said naming 
belgium as the countrys leading competitor in value 
exports last year totaled 200 million with west germany 
france britain austria and the united states the leading buyers 
respectively

japan and the united states disagreed monday over 
specific plans for structural reforms of the japanese economy but 
a senior us official said progress was made and the talks were 
friendly and cooperative 
mondays meetings began a final round of trade talks dubbed the 
structural impediments initiative officials said they focused on 
japans plans for changing policies and business practices that are 
thought to impede imports and foreign investment 
the two sides remained apart on the issue of public works 
spending said the us official who spoke on condition he not be 
further identified 
japan has agreed at us urging to spend more on parks roads 
sewers and other public infrastructure both to stimulate more 
imports and to reduce the imbalance between savings and investment 
in this thrifty nation but the two sides disagree over the amount 
needed to significantly affect the trade imbalance 
us officials said earlier they were hoping for a 500 trillion 
yen or 322 trillion public works package for the next 10 years 
they also said they would like japan to promise to spend a certain 
percentage of its gross national product on such projects 
japanese officials however have indicated they favor spending 
between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen or 258 trillion to 
268 trillion in the next decade on public works 
so far they have rejected the request to specify what portion 
of gnp they will spend on public works saying this would limit 
their ability to adapt public spending to changing economic 
conditions 
the us official who attended mondays talks declined to 
specify the figures being considered but he said we noted the 
current figure under discussion would not represent a significant 
increase relative to the size of the japanese economy 
japan also has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores 
speed up processing of patent applications crack down on allegedly 
unfair business practices by corporate groups and revise its land 
use policies 
the changes are aimed at making the japanese economy more open 
to trade and foreign investment 
senior japanese officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the talks were relatively constructive 
i think the americans were satisfied about some things and 
dissatisfied about others one of the officials said 
on tuesday the talks will focus on us plans to do more to cut 
the federal budget deficit encourage savings curb excessive 
consumption and improve worker training and education changes 
aimed at boosting us export competitiveness 
washington has filled in the gaps and increased the 
specificity of pledges it made in an interim report on the talks 
in april the us official said he declined to explain specific 
measures taken 
the official said washington expects reforms initiated during 
the talks to have a noticeable impact on trade imbalances in the 
medium term about two or three years 
but he said the impact was likely to be more apparent in the two 
nations overall trade imbalances than in their bilateral trade 
accounts 
japans trade surplus with the united states last year was 49 
billion according to the us commerce department its global 
trade surplus was 7692 billion the united states posted a total 
trade deficit of 109 billion in 1989

the supreme court monday decided against 
exempting the mining industry from some federal environmental rules 
for treating storing and disposing of hazardous waste 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the american 
mining congress and a mining company solite corp the two 
challenged a 1987 decision by the environmental protection agency 
to apply the hazardous waste regulations to the mining industry 
the industry said it should be exempt under a 1980 law called 
the bevill amendment which temporarily excluded some solid wastes 
from epa rules until the agency could complete a study 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year the epa 
did not exceed its power in enforcing the regulations for the 
mining industry 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
industry appeal 
justice department lawyers noted that waste generated from 
mining including ash and sludge was believed to pose less of a 
hazard to the environment than other forms of toxic waste 
but the government said chemicals and compounds are released 
from the mining wastes that are known to have adverse effects on 
humans or other life forms 
the government said it therefore was appropriate for the epa to 
apply stringent rules to the mining wastes 
the case is american mining congress vs environmental 
protection agency 891511 
in other action monday the court 
agreed to decide whether the secretary of labor or a safety 
and health review board has the last word on what federal 
regulations require for onthejob safety 
the courts decision expected sometime next year will 
determine whether cfampi steel corp of pueblo colo must pay a 
10000 fine for not making sure the respirators given to coke oven 
workers fit them properly 
the case is dole vs occupational safety and health review 
commission 891541 
refused to free communications satellite corp from having to 
refund 388 million to its customers the court without comment 
rejected arguments by comsat that the federal communications 
commission exceeded its authority in ordering the refunds 
the case is communications satellite corp vs fcc 891687 
refused to reinstate a 14 million lawyer fees award royal 
crown cola won and then lost for its 1986 challenges to two 
proposed mergers of soft drink companies the court without 
comment let stand a ruling that royal crown is not entitled to be 
reimbursed for the lawyer fees it incurred in fighting the 
lateraborted mergers 
the case is royal crown cola vs cocacola co 891756 
refused to revive a 14yearold lawsuit by a texas oil 
refinerys black employees who say they are victims of racial 
discrimination the court without comment left intact a ruling 
that dismissed the suit against a union and gulf oil corp 
the case is bernard vs gulf oil 891617 
left intact an 8 million antitrust award against blue cross 
and blue shield of kansas the justices without comment rejected 
arguments that the medical insurance company was trying only to cut 
costs not interfere with competition when it ended a contract 
with the largest hospital in wichita

forecasts for a midwestern heat wave helped push corn and 
soybean futures prices up sharply monday on the chicago board of 
trade amid fears that an extended dry spell could harm tender young 
sprouts 
wheat futures closed narrowly mixed reflecting perceptions that 
hot dry weather would benefit the maturing winter wheat crop 
on other commodity markets precious metals advanced copper 
fell energy futures were mixed livestock futures were mixed and 
pork bellies declined the daily limit for the third straight day 
on the chicago board of trade wheat futures settled 3 cents 
lower to cent higher with the contract for delivery in july at 
333 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 8 cents higher with july at 
287 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents higher with july at 
138 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 19 cents higher with 
july at 612 a bushel 
a high pressure sytem featuring temperatures in the 90s is 
expected to edge into the western corn belt from the southwest by 
wednesday 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago said a heat wave of three to five days would benefit crops 
flooded by last weeks rains in iowa missouri and illinois 
dry weather also would allow midwestern farmers to finish their 
soybean planting which was 89 percent complete as of sunday 
compared with a fiveyear average of 93 percent according to the 
agriculture departments weekly cropprogress report 
but if the expected heat lasts beyond five days young plants 
could be damaged and traders will start pushing the panic 
button karlin said 
its not uncommon for these highpressure systems to become 
entrenched in an area for a fairly long while eight to 10 days 
he said 
at that point you would have dried out the topsoil to an 
undesirable degree 
a sixto10day national weather service outlook released after 
the close did not threaten an extended heat wave though it 
predicted normal temperatures and aboveaverage precipitation for 
the midwest during the period july 1july 5 
the usda crop progress report also showed slight deterioration 
last week in the conditions of the soybean and winter wheat crops 
while the corn crop improved slightly 
gold futures posted their strongest gains in five weeks on new

ounce silver was 02 cent to 04 cent higher with july at 4822 a 
troy ounce 
copper futures fell moderately on the commodity exchange 
reflecting ideas that supplies are likely to grow as demand slows 
during the summer months 
copper settled 16 cents to 285 cents lower with june at 1095 
a pound 
crude oil futures slipped in lackluster trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
gasoline futures showed strength though boosted by gains in 
the cash market and strong dealer demand ahead of the fourth of 
july holiday 
west texas intermediate crude oil finished 4 cents to 13 cents 
lower with august at 1738 a barrel heating oil was 17 cent 
lower to 26 cent higher with july at 4892 cents a gallon

6227 cents a gallon 
nearterm pork belly futures fell the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange for the third 
straight day mostly in reaction to a government report friday that 
showed a largerthanexpected supply of bellies in the nations 
commercial freezers 
cattle futures also finished mostly lower reflecting slack 
packer demand for animals and weaker retailer demand for beef 
products 
live cattle settled unchanged to 17 cent lower with august at 
7310 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 28 cent lower 
with august at 8447 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent to 75

armco inc announced monday it would 
record about 70 million in secondquarter charges against earnings 
because of costs from a breachofcontract suit and federal tax 
assessment against the steelmaker 
a charge against earnings is an accounting practice used by 
companies to reflect unusual expenses 
a 20 million charge relates to a 1986 lawsuit filed against 
armco in houston the case ended may 11 when a jury awarded the 
plaintiffs 468 million that judgment was later reduced by 26 
million armco said in a statement 
awh1 ltd and mbank filed the lawsuit after armco decided not 
to occupy an office building that was built for it shortly after 
the filing mbank was seized by federal banking regulators and 
acquired by bank one texas company spokesman james herzog said 
the steelmaker also paid 15 million to settle federal taxes and 
interest for the tax years between 1978 and 1982 
the charges also include an estimated 30 million for armco 
financial services group companies subsidiaries that the parent is 
liquidating 
as a result of the charges armco said it expected to report 
unspecified losses for the secondquarter and first half of 1990 
the charges also prevent armco from paying common stock dividends

cassettes and about twice as expensive sony offers 60minute 
90minute and 120minute tapes for 12 15 and 18 respectively 
ms haber said 
digital audio tape or dat decks offer the sound fidelity of 
compact discs their introduction to the us market had been held 
up by record companies who feared dats ability to make 
nearperfect recordings of compact discs will encourage pirating 
and cut into disc sales 
that issue was for the most part resolved last summer however 
when an agreement was reached on new technology that would allow 
digital copies of compact discs but not copies of the resulting 
tapes 
the accord had seemed to resolve the threat that us record 
companies would sue manufacturers if their dat machines did not 
have some type of anticopying technology 
but george scarlett product manager for tower records in 
sacramento calif noted that for every new technology there 
grows a cottage industry intent on cracking it 
i am sure there are hobbyists at home that will find their way 
around the circuitry on these things scarlett said 
felix loo who manages discorama music world in new york said 
he has been selling gray market dat machines imported directly 
from japan at an average price of 1200 for more than a year 
weve sold a lot of units said loo who declined to give 
specific figures 
salesman david moseley of sony esby grove audio video in 
houston would not say how many units the store was carrying none 
will be sold until saturday when the store carries in ad in local 
newspaper business sections 
consumers are interested they are cautious they are confused 
with all the different formats but i think that most consumers 
understand that this will eventually replace the cassette as we 
know it today moseley said 
what will happen is the way the lp and the cassette coexisted 
happily well have the cd and dat coexist happily moseley said 
matsushita electric industrial co the japan firm that produces 
the panasonic technics and quasar brands hopes to introduce a dat 
recorder in the us market some time this year 
matsushitas unit will cost about 1300 the company said at 
the consumer electronics show here earlier this month

fisherprice has agreed to place warnings on 
packages cautioning consumers that its little people figures 
present a choking hazard to children the state attorney general 
said monday 
the toy sold separately and as part of various fisherprice 
play sets have been linked to the choking deaths of at least five 
children nationwide and left one child severely brain damaged 
attorney general robert abrams said 
the company also agreed to pay the state a 25000 penalty 
abrams said 
the toy firm based in east aurora ny agreed to place labels 
on all packages beginning next month and print warnings directly 
onto packages by next year 
fisherprice spokeswoman carol blackley said the companys 
packages already bear a warning that the product is not intended 
for children who still put objects in their mouths she said the 
new labels will warn consumers about the potential choking hazard 
the toy manufacturer a division of the chicagobased quaker 
oats company says it has sold 670 million little people toys 
the figures hollow and often less than one inch in diameter 
are marketed for children ages 2 to 6 the toys meet federal safety 
guidelines 
but abrams said the companys present packaging does not 
adequately disclose the potential choking hazard in violation of 
new yorks general business law prohibiting deceptive trade 
practices 
abrams had asked the consumer product safety commission in 1987 
to change federal regulations governing the size of toys that can 
be sold to children under age three but his request was denied 
edward barbini a spokesman for the attorney general said 
abrams would continue pressing for changes on the federal level

lawyers for 912 west virginians suing 
ashland oil inc over alleged health and property damage added 
charges of fraud and obstruction of justice to their lawsuit monday 
the complaint filed in kanawha county circuit court asks for 
110 million in damages boosting the amount sought in the suit to 
291 billion 
the residents allege emissions from ashland oils refinery 
complex in nearby catlettsburg ky have hurt their health and 
property ashland oil has denied the claims and has said no link 
has been made between its emissions and any alleged health problems 
ashland oil has been hit by a 103 million judgment in the 
first of several jury trials expected to stem from the lawsuit 
four plaintiffs will share in that award if it withstands appeal 
the rest involved in the suit will bring their claims to trial in 
groups of five 
the amended lawsuit said the fraud charge stemmed from a 
february 1988 letter ashland oil chairman john hall wrote to 
kenovaarea residents halls letter said emissions from the 
refinery were a nuisance but were harmless when they in fact 
contained toxic calcium oxide the suit said 
in addition before and during the initial jury trial ashland 
oil allegedly expended large amounts of corporate funds in and 
around kanawha county to promote the company the new complaint 
said 
at the same time plaintiffs witnesses and some news reporters 
covering the matter were threatened and harassed the suit said 
ashland oil spokesman roger schrum said monday the allegations 
of fraud and obstruction of justice are false and ridiculous

caterpillar inc forecast a sharp drop in 
its secondquarter and 1990 earnings monday largely blaming the 
business impact of brazils economic austerity program for hurting 
its results 
caterpillar projected its annual profits will be substantially 
lower than in 1989 when it earned 497 million the 1989 results 
represented a 19 percent drop from the previous years record 
profit of 616 million 
revenue is expected to remain flat this year matching the 
record 111 billion of 1989 
the peoriabased maker of farm and industrial equipment said its 
results would be affected adversely by the brazilian governments 
efforts to slow inflation and increase competition 
we knew the governments plans to restore brazils financial 
viability would be severe and would cause us some shortterm 
problems but we support the governments actions said company 
spokesman richard e stober 
stober said sales volumes would be lower but higher prices 
would compensate for the drop 
secondquarter results due out july 20 will be more than 50 
percent below the 99 million profit in the first quarter stober 
said in the second quarter last year caterpillar earned 141 
million on sales of 29 billion 
the first quarter earnings were down 30 percent from the 141 
million earned during the same period a year earlier although 
sales improved 10 percent to 286 billion 
stober said sales in brazil have been relatively strong but 
without any price relief the government has frozen all the 
prices and it appears we will be selling at a loss for the year in 
brazil 
caterpillar employs 5100 of its 60000member worldwide 
workforce at two plants in brazil 
workers there build gas diesel and marine engines generator 
sets winches as well as an assortment of wheel loaders tractor 
scrapers bull dozers rippers motor graders and tracktype 
tractors 
in 1989 caterpillars latin american territory including 
mexico central america and south america bought 447 million of 
equipment manufactured at the companys us factories in 
addition caterpillar sold 382 million worth of products made in 
latin america 
other factors contributing to caterpillars profit decline 
include tight us monetary policies and higher inflation stober 
said also a costly plant modernization program is taking longer 
than expected and costing more than projected 
caterpillar says that with no further deterioration in the world 
economy and a more stable economy in brazil its profits are 
expected to improve in 1991

motorola inc and hitachi ltd said monday they 
have agreed to settle an 18month legal battle over powerful 
computer chips that form the brains for several popular computer 
lines 
the two companies also will jointly seek a stay of a court order 
barring them from manufacturing and selling the products motorola 
said in a statement 
motorola based in schamburg outside chicago charged in a 1989 
lawsuit that hitachi of japan had infringed on several of its 
patents and engaged in unfair competition in the sale of computer 
microprocessors 
us district judge lucius bunton in midland texas on june 18 
barred motorola from marketing its m68030 microprocessor he also 
barred hitachi from marketing its similar but far less widely 
used h8532 chip 
a day later the us court of appeals in washington granted 
motorolas motion to delay buntons order motorola said monday the 
two companies jointly will seek a stay from the appeals court 
pending appeal of the case 
providing the court issues the stay both companies will 
continue to supply their customers with the products while they 
work to finalize their agreement to settle the case motorola said 
a motorola spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the statement 
which said officials of the two companies have reached an 
agreement in principle that will serve as a framework for ending 
the dispute 
motorola shipped 500000 of its m68030 chips last year yielding 
what analysts estimated to be 100 million in revenue the chip is 
used in the more advanced lines of computers produced by such 
companies as apple computer inc hewlett packard corp and sun 
microsystems inc 
hitachis similar h8532 microprocessor was distributed only to 
about 200 customers in japan and to none in the united states 
hitachi has said 
a microprocessor is a digital electronic device that performs 
the control and arithmetic functions of a computer

japan and the united states disagreed monday over 
specific plans for structural reforms of the japanese economy but 
a senior us official said progress was made and the talks were 
friendly and cooperative 
mondays meetings began a final round of trade talks dubbed the 
structural impediments initiative officials said they focused on 
japans plans for changing policies and business practices that are 
thought to impede imports and foreign investment 
the two sides remained apart on the issue of public works 
spending said the us official who spoke on condition he not be 
further identified 
japan has agreed at us urging to spend more on parks roads 
sewers and other public infrastructure both to stimulate more 
imports and to reduce the imbalance between savings and investment 
in this thrifty nation but the two sides disagree over the amount 
needed to significantly affect the trade imbalance 
us officials said earlier they were hoping for a 500 trillion 
yen or 322 trillion public works package for the next 10 years 
they also said they would like japan to promise to spend a certain 
percentage of its gross national product on such projects 
japanese officials however have indicated they favor spending 
between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen or 258 trillion to 
268 trillion in the next decade on public works 
so far they have rejected the request to specify what portion 
of gnp they will spend on public works saying this would limit 
their ability to adapt public spending to changing economic 
conditions 
the us official who attended mondays talks declined to 
specify the figures being considered but he said we noted the 
current figure under discussion would not represent a significant 
increase relative to the size of the japanese economy 
japan also has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores 
speed up processing of patent applications crack down on allegedly 
unfair business practices by corporate groups and revise its land 
use policies 
the changes are aimed at making the japanese economy more open 
to trade and foreign investment 
senior japanese officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the talks were relatively constructive 
i think the americans were satisfied about some things and 
dissatisfied about others one of the officials said 
on tuesday the talks will focus on us plans to do more to cut 
the federal budget deficit encourage savings curb excessive 
consumption and improve worker training and education changes 
aimed at boosting us export competitiveness 
washington has filled in the gaps and increased the 
specificity of pledges it made in an interim report on the talks 
in april the us official said he declined to explain specific 
measures taken 
the official said washington expects reforms initiated during 
the talks to have a noticeable impact on trade imbalances in the 
medium term about two or three years 
but he said the impact was likely to be more apparent in the two 
nations overall trade imbalances than in their bilateral trade 
accounts 
meanwhile in washington us trade representative carla hills 
raised the possibility that the july deadline for reaching 
agreement on a final report in the structural barriers negotiations 
may not be met 
hills said it may be necessary to hold another round of talks if 
all of the issues are not resolved at this weeks bargaining 
session 
we will continue to talk until the job is done if there needs 
to be another meeting so be it hills said during a speech to a 
trade conference sponsored by the institute for international 
economics 
failure to reach agreement by the original deadline of early 
july opens the threat that usjapan trade problems would cast a 
pall over the july 911 houston summit of the worlds seven richest 
industrial countries 
in her speech hills raised the spectre of a backlash against 
japanese imports in the united states if the current talks fail to 
expand foreign business opportunities in japan 
we simply must have japan open up faster she said japan 
isnt open and until we get that parity of opportunity we will have 
an enormous buildup of antagonism that creates a backdrop for very 
bad public policy 
japans trade surplus with the united states last year was 49 
billion according to the us commerce department its global 
trade surplus was 7692 billion the united states posted a total 
trade deficit of 109 billion in 1989

the southern co said monday it has reached a 
tentative agreement worth 300 million to settle a dispute over an 
energy sales contract with gulf states utilities co 
the agreement which is subject to federal regulatory approval 
would end all litigation between atlantabased southern and gulf 
states which is based in beaumont texas 
the dispute stemmed from a 1982 deal by four southern utility 
subsidiaries to sell 1 billion worth of electricity to gulf states 
from 1984 through 1992 
but in 1985 gulf states asked southern to suspend or end the 
sales saying its customers energy needs had fallen below expected 
levels 
southern said gulf states discontinued most payments in 1986 
southern subsequently stopped all transactions with the company 
southern contended that gulf states was required to continue 
accepting and paying for the electric power but gulf states 
argued the contract required good faith negotiations whenever 
changes in purchases were requested 
the case went before federal energy regulatory commission the 
us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the 
us supreme court a separate suit is still pending in the us 
district court in texas 
under the proposed settlement southern will receive 75 million 
in cash 6 million new shares of gulf states common stock with 
very limited voting rights and a 160 million promissory note 
payable on jan 1 1993 
the settlement says that if the highest price of gulf states 
common stock does not average 1825 a share for five consecutive 
days through jan 1 1993 southern will get a cash payment for the 
difference between the average price and 1825 a share 
the agreement has a net present value of about 300 million 
southern said 
gulf states is putting its lewis creek power plant near willis 
texas up as collateral for future payments under the settlement 
were pleased that weve been able to resolve this contract 
dispute in outofcourt negotiations and come to terms that protect 
the longterm interests of our companies said southern president 
ed addison 
addison said it was too early to say what effect the settlement 
would have on southerns earnings 
gulf states chairman linn draper said the settlement avoids the 
possibility that litigation over the dispute would drag on for 
years 
this dark cloud has in many ways hampered our ability to look 
to the future draper said gsu management believes that 
removing this cloud at this time and in this manner is in the best 
interests of the company its shareholders and its customers 
draper said gulf states cash outlay for the settlement through 
1999 could be as little as 167 million 
the southern co is the corporate parent of alabama power co 
georgia power co mississippi power co gulf power co and 
savannah electric co at the time of the contract with gulf states 
savannah electric was not part of southern 
gulf states does business primarily in texas and louisiana

foxboros 126 million outstanding shares for 52 a share in a 
cash tender offer to begin friday siebe shareholders will be asked 
to vote on the offer by july 27 siebe said in a statement 
siebe plc is a leading manufacturer of industrial and 
environmental controls compressedair products specialized 
engineering products and lifesupport products

billion pretax profits rose 19 percent to 310 million 
foxboro systems are used to record and control manufacturing 
processes such as temperature pressure humidity and liquid 
levels most of its customers which include exxon corp and dow 
chemical co are in the chemical and petroleum industries 
an 82yearold company with an old and loyal customer base and 
7000 employees foxboro recently emerged from a restructuring it 
has a new product line that enables foxboro systems to be 
integrated with those of other companies but bugs in the new 
product had to be worked out and for the past four years the 
company has been borrowing money to pay for its operations 
the company reported 1989 net sales of 598 million and income 
before taxes of 15 million 
foxboro stock also has been flat earlier this month before 
rumors of a possible sale stock sold for 24 a share last year it 
traded as low as 1862 the stock soared monday after the possible 
merger was announced closing at 51 a share on the new york stock 
exchange up 1287 from fridays closing price 
barrie stephens siebe vice president and chief executive 
officer said foxboro co would operate as an independent

we will benefit from combined technologies products and 
distribution capabilities allowing us to increase our activities in 
various segments of the controls business stephens said in a 
prepared statement 
gary willis foxboro chairman president and chief executive

for investor relations said siebe was among several new partners 
the company considered the british company which dates back to 
the early 19th century was the higher bidder and also promised to 
suit foxboros need to expand in an increasingly competitive 
marketplace he said 
as weve gone through our longterm strategic planning 
looking at the 90s we see much larger and broaderbased 
competition facing us fuller said we felt that foxboro as a 
single controlbased company needed a larger technological base 
and an ability to provide more capability to our customers 
about two weeks ago foxboro satisfied takeover rumors by 
disclosing it was seeking a possible purchase 
one has to be very happy for shareholders its a premium of 
nearrecord magnitude said analyst john w adams of adams 
harkness amp hill in boston noting more typically such offers come 
in at 30 or 40 percent above what a stock regularly commands 
adams said the company was undervalued if you assumed it was 
going to be wellmanaged 
neverthless one has to mourn the passing of yet another 
independent new england company adams said referring to such 
recent international change of hands as the takeover of norton co 
norton a worcesterbased maker of abrasives is awaiting 
government approval to merge with the french compagnie de saint

international lease finance corp 
a major aircraft leaser agreed monday to be acquired by american 
international group inc for 13 billion to gain the financial 
backing of the insurance giant 
aig the largest us underwriter of commercial and industrial 
insurance also will provide ilfc with 125 million in financing as 
part of the deal 
analysts and spokesmen said the deal gives ilfc financial muscle 
at a time when the leasing outfit must borrow heavily to complete 
an ambitious expansion 
theyve found someone with lots of cash low cost of funds 
and willing to take some greater risk in return for greater 
rewards said daniel a hersch a securities analyst with bateman 
eichler hill richards inc in los angeles 
ilfc one of the worlds biggest aircraft leasing companies 
owns 98 jetliners worth more than 3 billion and averaging only 
three years of age 
it has placed 10 billion worth of firm orders for planes to be 
delivered over 10 years and has another 4 billion in options 
that means ilfc which already has had to borrow heavily and 
occasionally issue new stock to finance its deals will need much 
more capital at a time when it is harder to come by 
i think that having a strategic alliance with a backer of the 
stature and creditworthiness of aig should instill a greater 
confidence in the financial markets jay jacobsen a spokesman 
for ilfc said in a telephone interview from new york 
ilfc will continue to borrow in the markets to raise capital 
jacobsen said aigs triplea debt rating the highest ranking 
possible will enable ilfc to borrow funds more cheaply 
the deal also helps aig further its goal of increasing its 
financial services business such as leasing said maurice r 
greenberg chairman and chief executive officer of the new 
yorkbased insurer 
the company had operating income of about 150 million in 
financial services other than insurance last year out of total 
operating income of nearly 2 billion greenberg said the company 
hopes to boost that figure to close to 500 million in the next 
couple of years he said 
the buyout price of 3250 a share is about 15 or 16 times 
expected earnings for this year at the top of the recent trading 
range for ilfc stock hersch said 
the stock closed at 2687 in overthecounter trading monday 
it had sunk as low as 1937 in the past year 
jacobsen said the stock had been undervalued because of investor 
worries over debt despite the fact that ilfcs purchase agreements 
for boeing and other planes are at extremely good prices 
the asset values were substantially above the stock price 
he said 
ilfcs management will be unchanged and the company will 
continue to be based in beverly hills operating as a wholly owned 
aig subsidiary it is 53 percent owned by three men all of whom 
have approved the merger leslie l gonda the board chairman 
steven f udvarhazy president and chief executive and louis l 
gonda executive vice president 
the definitive agreement has been approved by aigs executive 
committee by ilfcs directors and by a special committee of 
ilfcs independent directors the companies said in a joint news 
statement 
under the deal ilfc shareholders can receive 3250 a share in 
cash or 50 cents a share plus 03 shares of aig common stock the 
amount of aig stock to be exchanged can be adjusted depending on 
aigs share price at the time the deal closes 
ilfcs three controlling owners have agreed to accept aig stock 
for their holdings jacobsen said

southern natural gas co has agreed to 
pay arco oil and gas co more than 300 million for damages that 
resulted from an explosion on an arco drilling platform in the gulf 
of mexico last year 
the march 19 1989 blast and resulting fire killed seven 
people injured 23 and destroyed the platform the blast occurred 
while workers for southern natural gas were attempting to make 
repairs on the platform 
representatives agreed on the settlement monday during a recess 
in a civil trial that began june 11 in state district court in 
madison county 
they presented the agreement to judge bill mcadams while he was 
holding court in neighboring grimes county 
we feel weve been adequately compensated for our losses 
said don riddle lead counsel for arco 
aside from pennzoil its the largest settlement around as far 
as anybody knows riddle told the bryancollege station eagle 
pennzoil co in 1984 won a 103 billion judgment against texaco 
inc after claiming that texaco had broken up its deal to buy getty 
oil co texaco agreed to settle the case for 3 billion in 1988 
houston attorney randy wilson one of about 20 attorneys 
representing southern natural gas declined to comment on the 
settlement 
according to the settlement southern natural gas made no 
admission of guilt but agreed to pay arco 3005 million by aug 6 
and to pay a total of 500000 to three arco employees injured in 
the explosion 
arco was a party to several lawsuits pending against southern 
natural gas in federal court in louisiana the settlement will end 
those suits riddle said 
the settlement will be paid by the gas companys insurance 
carriers primarily lloyds of london riddle said 
arco had asked for between 250 million and 325 million in 
actual damages and 5 billion in exemplary damages resulting from 
the explosion on a drilling platform about five miles south of the 
mouth of the mississippi river 
in addition to damage to the platform itself arco claimed it 
lost about 200 million in profits from oil and natural gas sales 
because the destroyed platform was crucial to a sevenplatform oil 
field 
southern natural gas bought natural gas from arco and 
transported it to shore by means of pipeline running from the 
platform the explosion occurred when subcontractors hired by the 
gas company cut into the pipeline while trying to make repairs
