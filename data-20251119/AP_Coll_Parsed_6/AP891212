evidence showing cold fusion may be a 
real way to produce energy was presented tuesday by tennessee 
scientists prompting a senator to urge the government to 
reconsider a recommendation against special funding for such 
research 
but a member of a us department of energy advisory board that 
recommended against such funding said the panel remains unconvinced 
by the new findings 
gordon michaels of oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee 
presented the new results here tuesday to a meeting of the american 
society of mechanical engineers 
chuck scott a chemist and senior research fellow who leads the 
labs research team said the experiments repeatedly found 
unexplained excesses of energy released in the form of heat and 
also found inconsistent signs of neutrons and the chemical tritium 
which are products of fusion reactions 
we feel very strongly we have observed excess energy he 
said we feel confident in being able to measure the heat it was 
sufficiently above experimental noise that we know its really 
there 
nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun and hydrogen 
bombs attempts to harness it as an unlimited source of energy 
previously concentrated on simulating the extremely high 
temperatures and pressures found in the sun 
chemist b stanley pons of the university of utah and a 
colleague martin fleischmann of england announced in march they 
had created a nuclear fusion reaction in a bottle of heavy water 
using a palladium electrode wrapped in platinum wire they ran 
electricity through the two metals and reported that the device put 
out more energy than they put into it 
the potential to create vast amounts of power in a jar of water 
which could be cheap easy and have relatively benign byproducts 
sparked a furious series of attempts by scientists around the world 
to reproduce the ponsfleischmann results 
but many scientists soon became convinced that pons and 
fleischmann were mistaken and that their research was sloppy 
the new findings prompted us sen jake garn rutah to urge 
the energy department which oversees oak ridge national 
laboratory to reverse a recommendation against special funding 
for cold fusion research the recommendation was made by the 
departments energy research advisory board 
advisory board cochairman john r huizenga a chemistry and 
physics professor at the university of rochester ny said the 
panel remains unconvinced by the oak ridge experiments 
he said the panel considered the findings in writing its report 
and recommendations to secretary of energy james d watkins the 
panel which issued the final report friday was sympathetic toward 
restricted study within present funding limits 
the oak ridge group has been doing tests since april scott said 
excess energy was measured for several hours at a stretch usually 
on the order of 5 percent to 8 percent above what would be 
considered normal on one occasion excess heat of up to 50 percent 
was measured for a period of 12 hours he said 
the oak ridge researchers also found what seemed to be excess 
levels of neutrons and tritium but not consistently asked what 
the results mean scott replied i dont know

legend has it that the flying dutchman was 
condemned to roam the seas eternally coming ashore just once every 
seven years in search of redemption 
his ordeal was nothing compared to that of metropolitan opera 
audiences who have had to wait more than a decade between 
performances of wagners youthful masterpiece about the ghostly 
sailor 
the mets reluctance was understandable its last attempt at 
the flying dutchman by the late jeanpierre ponnelle was 
nearly hooted off the stage at its 1979 premiere that production 
which turned the action into the dream of a minor character is now 
frequently cited as a textbook case of how a composers intention 
can be distorted for the sake of operatic novelty 
for its new staging which premiered monday night the company 
wisely called on a traditionalist august everding the head of the 
bavarian state opera who has successfully produced several other 
operas here including wagners lohengrin 
everdings dutchman with sets by hans schavernoch costumes 
by lore haas and lighting by gil wechsler is impressive to look 
at from the forbidding rocks that line the norwegian coast to the 
ominous appearance of the dutchmans ship and its sepulchral crew 
the dutchman arrives on a mechanized gangplank that may be 
anachronistic for the 18th century but is eerily effective less 
apparent is why a norwegian house of the period would have electric 
lights or why the spinning wheels wagner calls for have been 
replaced by sewing machines 
no production of the opera will get very far unless the title 
role is strongly cast and here the met was fortunate to have bass 
james morris he began tentatively failing to make the most of his 
brooding opening soliloquy but his resonant tones became 
impressive in the act two love duet and thrilling in the closing 
moments of the opera 
as senta the maiden who is willing to die to bring the dutchman 
salvation soprano mechtild gessendorf filled the house with 
bright silvery tones and threw herself into the role 
enthusiastically vocally she fell short only in her upper 
register which on occasion turned screechy 
in supporting roles bass paul plishka was a stalwart daland 
sentas pragmatic father and tenor gary lakes was suitably 
distraught as erik her jilted fiance tenor robert gambill making 
his debut as the steersman displayed a small but beautiful voice 
music director james levine conducted the met orchestra which 
as usual these days sounded superb

ken voss never saw jimi hendrix perform live but 
hes spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture 
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations 
its funny when i go on tour with hendrix material or stage 
concerts devoted to his music voss said recently we get the 
14yearolds and the 34yearolds but the 24yearolds dont seem 
to know who jimi hendrix was 
theres sort of a gap there part of a generation apparently 
doesnt realize what a force hendrix exerted on the music performed 
today 
voss is trying to close the gap spreading the word about the 
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an 
unsettling feedbackladen rendition of the national anthem at the 
woodstock music festival 
a former music journalist voss is founder of the jimi hendrix 
information management institute jimi curator of a mobile museum 
of the stars memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter 
titled voodoo child a name taken from a hendrix hit 
hes become a oneman clearinghouse of information about the 
seattleborn hendrix since his drugrelated death in a british 
ambulance sept 18 1970 
as my wife says im a fan turned fanatic i spend 12 to 20 
hours a week on jimi hendrix voss 38 said in a telephone 
interview from his des plaines home 
the newsletter has about 1500 subscribers including one fan in 
the soviet union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such 
hendrix selections as foxy lady and purple haze 
a recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members 
of hendrixs various backup bands and the going prices for hendrix 
memorabilia ranging from 4 for a massprinted poster to 4495 
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician 
ive also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by 
hendrix but i dont dare exhibit that because its worth from 
15000 to 25000 voss said 
that particular model of electric guitar from those years a 
fender stratocaster would bring 2500 in its own right now but 
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that jimi touched 
it 
hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years thats 
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance 
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar 
lying in feedbackshrieking flames 
i dont know how many guitars jimi destroyed but i do know 
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new 
guitars from the pieces voss said 
when voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs concert halls 
and college campuses around the midwest he notices many visitors 
staring at one exhibit a copy of hendrix death certificate 
which ends with the words insufficient evidence of circumstances 
open verdict 
too many people these days only know hendrix as a victim of 
drugs they dont know about his genius as a musician voss said 
the fact is that although his death was drugrelated jimi 
hendrix did not die of an overdose he was not even known among the 
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user although i 
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it 
would be now

the mustang ranch may soon be an equal 
opportunity brothel the owner wants to add dudes 
this will be a place for women to have a little fun for a 
change said joe conforte 
conforte said he wants to build an addition called mustang f for 
female he said it would have high class facilities and a 
band where employees could romance women who just want sex 
without entanglements 
sure a lot of women just want to be wined and dined but 
believe me theyll want the sex too conforte said but with 
women you got to treat them differently you got to show them the 
stars and the moon 
the plan hinges on a stock offering for the brothel the 
underwriter of the offering said more than enough buyers have 
expressed interest in a 17 million proposal to start selling 
shares before christmas 
eric walloga of american wallstreet securities inc of tampa 
fla said the issue is nearly ready to go on the market just one 
month after a restructured proposal was approved by the securities 
and exchange commission 
we have indications that we are past the 17 million mark but 
we want to wait until we have at least 30 million or 40 million 
just in case people dont go through with plans to buy the stock 
walloga said 
the stockholders would buy into a 60 percent interest in the 
350acre ranch and other properties as well as the business itself 
conforte and his wife sally would retain the remaining 40 percent 
interest and manage the ranch 
conforte said the proposed brothel for women could be added to 
the current 105room bordello within six months if the stock 
offering goes well hes raising the money to pay 13 million owed 
to the internal revenue service 
brothels are allowed in 11 of nevadas 14 rural counties 
conforte said he tried employing male escorts 14 years ago at 
the brothel 10 miles east of reno but ended the practice after 
deciding he needed a separate building for women clients 
i always planned to build it but i kept putting it off he 
said but recently i got a call from a nationally known woman 
who i wont name and she asked why i didnt hire men and it got me 
thinking again 
conforte who will be 64 in january has been trying to sell 
mustang since 1985 when he was released after serving 18 months in 
prison for tax evasion his first two attempts to take the mustang 
public failed

three organizations trying to pull poland into 
the world of agricultural capitalism say the 1990 harvest is 
critical and are urging us agribusiness to donate machinery and 
chemicals 
the us chamber of commerce sabre foundation and the 
foundation for the development of polish agriculture told 
representatives of farmrelated businesses at a seminar monday that 
their donations would be tax deductible 
the us tax code allows for a deduction of twice the cost for 
donations of inventory property for the care of the ill the needy 
or minor children private polish farmers qualify as needy under 
the code said tax lawyer stuart a smith who appeared on a panel 
at the seminar 
poland has the potential to be a major contributor to the 
world food supply but it is not a major contributor at this 
time said david hopper world bank senior vice president 
he said 77 percent of the farms are privately owned while 23 
percent are stateowned cooperatives that have been the only 
beneficiaries of technological advancements made in polish 
agriculture 
the private sector has been starved from modern inputs 
hopper said adding that productivity is low as a result 
they are good farmers but they dont know how to farm in the 
context of modern agriculture hopper said 
under the plan devised by the sabre foundation state 
cooperatives would be omitted from us private sector donations 
because the tax code requires the donations to go to private 
individuals to qualify as deductions 
that will keep the remnants of the communist system from 
benefiting from american private industrys efforts and will boost 
the private side of polands agricultural economy smith said 
the donations are needed because of a gap in the 533 million 
aid package congress provided hungary and poland said josiah lee 
auspitz secretary of the sabre foundation 
the government is sending commodities and expertise to poland 
but there was no provision in the law for the products and 
equipment needed to make a modern farm system work auspitz said 
polish banks dont have the money that americans banks do to 
give loans against next years harvest to enable the farmers to buy 
machinery pesticides and fertilizers he said 
fertilizers animal care products animal feed pesticides 
fungicides and herbicides top the list of items polish farmers 
need also needed is machinery such as tractors planters grain 
drills potato seeders fertilizer spreaders manure spreaders 
plows sprayers chain saws and harvesters 
many of the private farms are small and others are parttime 
operations used by families as a buffer against food shortages 
said jb penn of sparks commodities inc penn has been working 
with the foundation for the development of polish agriculture 
of the 27 million farms in poland about 125 million are 
producing for the marketplace he said 
the experts at the seminar were optimistic about polands 
ability to move to a privately controlled agricultural system 
because of the large number of private farms already operating 
but success rests on proving the private farms can get more food 
to the polish people than theyve been getting from the state 
cooperatives they said 
polish farmers need the machinery and chemicals by april 1 the 
beginning of the growing season to show progress in the 1990 
harvest 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher sent a letter to the seminar 
encouraging participation saying sabres plan follows the intent 
of the agreement he signed on private sector cooperation between 
poland and the united states 
founded in 1969 as an educationalscientific taxexempt 
organization the sabre foundation describes itself as devoted to 
the philosophy and practice of free institutions 
the foundation for the development of polish agriculture is a 
nonprofit private foundation established in february 1988 to 
strengthen polands private sector farms

schools 
dr doogie played by neil patrick harris is just too far ahead 
of his time said helen rakin a harvard medical school admissions 
officer 
doogie howser would have had to graduate from college at 9

then after one year of internship and one year of residency 
obtain his license to practice at 16 she said in this weeks tv 
guide i dont think so 
dr henry m seidel associate dean of students at johns hopkins 
medical school said that if he were on the admissions committee a 
reallife doogie would never be accepted to medical school 
i would say to doogie look we need people with smarts 
youve got that now all you need is the rest of it when you 
get to be 19 or 20 then come back and reapply and chances are 
youre gonna get in but doogie not now just get your first

investigators who reexamined the dogsled trek 
of robert e peary over the arctic ice say he discovered the north 
pole exactly where when and how he claimed the snow cold 
dead reckoning navigational methods and skeptics 
notwithstanding 
the family is vindicated declared peary grandson edward 
peary stafford a retired navy commander after the navigation 
foundation at the behest and expense of the national geographic 
society accepted pearys account in every detail 
people who still disagree said stafford should join the flat 
earth society 
but national geographic president gilbert grosvenor said he 
suspects doubters will persist as they have for 80 years 
one of the most insistent is baltimore astronomer dennis 
rawlins who called the foundations findings a whitewash 
rawlins claimed in a 1973 book that peary had not gotten within 
100 miles of the north pole and had perpetuated the greatest 
scientific hoax of the century 
bias can do a lot and when you want to believe something it 
is easy to rawlins said it is a tragedy for american 
science 
at a 95minute news conference monday retired adm thomas d 
davies president of the navigation foundation said scientific 
analysis established that peary was where he claimed to be on april 
6 1909 on the top of the world 
a study of the shadows in pearys photographs established they 
were taken en route to and at the pole he said and the depth 
measurements the explorer made by dropping a piece of lead tied to 
piano wire in holes in the ice were verified by modern maps of the 
arctic oceans bottom 
the foundation said its 240page report will perhaps put an 
end to the long process of vilification of a courageous american 
explorer 
our analysis of the data peary brought back from his journey 
his celestial sights his diary his ocean sounding and his 
photographs has convinced us that their final camp named camp 
jesup was no more than five miles from the pole allowing for some 
inaccuracy in their instruments the report said 
from the start pearys claim that he and companion matthew 
henson and four eskimos reached the pole has been wrapped in 
controversy 
upon reaching home a dismayed peary discovered that another 
explorer frederick cook said he had beaten peary by a year 
cooks claim was eventually rejected and in 1911 congress certified 
peary as the discoverer 
the issue reopened in 1983 when a television docudrama gave the 
credit to cook then rawlins raised fresh doubts causing the 
society to commission the foundation to study all the evidence anew 
the foundation concluded that pearys dead reckoning method 
of navigation corrected by observations of the position of the sun 
every day at noon was entirely adequate for polar latitudes 
and it found nothing sinister in some of pearys behavior that 
is often cited by doubters his depression after achieving a 
lifetime goal the fact that his diary entry the pole at 
last was written on a detached piece of paper and his coolness 
toward henson 
peary was withdrawn and despondent aboard the roosevelt but 
that may have been because a member of the expedition professor 
ross marvin of cornell had died on his trek back to the ship or 
peary may have been physically and emotionally exhausted the 
scientists said 
he may have been irked with henson who had reached the location 
of their north pole camp first and thus claimed to be the first 
man to sit on top of the world 
his diary was never intended for public inspection so the 
detached conclusion was of no importance the report said 
we feel that we can say categorically that peary realized his 
lifelong goal of attaining the pole on the last of his many 
expeditions the report said certainly we turned up no 
evidence to the contrary

its a dilemma more people probably wish 
they faced whether to take the 30000ayear publicservice post 
or the 70000 job in a comfortable office 
its apparently a big problem for students at elite law schools 
when harvard law schools new dean did away with a counseling 
position that offered help for such crises of conscience students 
responded in a lawyerly manner 
they filed documents letters of protest and petitions that the 
office be reinstated 
experts say student reaction at harvard highlights a nationwide 
quandary among the best and brightest youth whose eagerness to take 
lowpaying public interest jobs runs up against the lure of money 
what youre hearing is the lament of students who cant resist 
temptation said harvard law professor philip heymann he said 
hes heard the cry for 15 years 
much of what these students are angry about is the greater 
american society and economy and that harvard simply does not try 
to wrestle it to the ground and turn it into a different society 
and a different economy 
harvard law school was the first to provide an adviser to help 
students find scarce public interest work and fend off seduction by 
big firms that aggressively recruit prospects such as ted bilich 
when the 25yearold from hartford conn graduates from 
harvard law this spring he will owe his lenders 58000 
does he take a job he badly wants with the us environmental 
protection agency or join the private firm in washington that badly 
wants him the bottomline difference is 42000 in annual salary 
trying to make my job choice ive felt no support bilich 
said i have no one to help me deal with this the overwhelming 
sense i get is that the choice is easy go to the washington law 
firm 
amy ruth tobol a lawyer who provides public interest counseling 
at new york university said another part of the problem is in the 
way lawyers are trained 
part of what happens at law school is that students are 
socialized to enter the legal profession she said the law is 
taught in the context of private practice the skill to argue any 
point of view is cultivated 
youre taught to divorce your feelings from your logical and 
analytical thinking abilities she said as a result the 
lawyerintraining puts aside personal inclinations and moral 
values 
part of the public interest counselors job is to help students 
keep those values even if it means going against the crowd family 
pressure and a society that says status goes with money 
bilich was an organizer of the emergency coalition for public 
interest placement at harvard that led the protests against dean 
robert c clarks decision to abolish the publicinterest counselor 
the post was established in the late 1970s to help students tap 
the network of increasingly scarce public interest jobs 
public interest law includes such areas as legal aid for the 
poor consumer advocacy environment and civil liberties public 
defenders assistant district attorneys and congressional staff 
while not all such jobs pay poorly they tend to fall far short 
of the 70000 to 80000 entry level salaries offered by some 
firms 
law students became so distressed that in 1986 they established 
the national association for public interest law a resource center 
in washington dc 
the anguish at harvard is a reaction to a national problem among 
law students who are inclined to altruism said michael 
caudellfeagan the organizations executive director 
they really are sort of rebelling against the current 
values caudellfeagan said they see these seductive jobs and 
they want someone to say no its all right not to take them 
caudellfeagan estimated that nationwide 3 percent of law 
graduates go into nonprofit public interest jobs and another 10 
percent go into government positions 
according to harvard records 1 percent of last years graduates 
took public interest jobs 
joining the harvard students in protest lawyers and judges 
wrote to clark questioning the cut 
the excounselor ron fox said clark told him his job was cut 
to save money 
clark did not return requests for comment but has responded to 
the complaints by pointing to a new 15 million endowment to 
foster careers in public interest law 
the school has programs to relieve students of their college 
loans if they take lowpaying public interest jobs and to support 
them in public interest summertime work

worries that foreigners are buying up america 
are unfounded although foreign ownership of us businesses 
increased dramatically in the past decade a washington research 
group says 
subsidiaries of foreign companies generally operate in the same 
manner as usowned companies the institute for international 
economics reported in a study released monday 
the foreign firms generally paid wages comparable to those in 
usowned businesses and invested about the same money in research 
and development in this country according to the study by paul 
krugman an economics professor at the massachusetts institute of 
technology and edwin m graham a business professor at duke 
university 
the study argued that it would be a mistake for congress to 
change us laws in an effort to block foreign investment 
especially given the fact that the united states depends on foreign 
capital flows of 100 billion annually to finance its merchandise 
trade deficits 
i have deplored as loudly as anyone the fact that we are 
having to attract 10 billion a month in foreign investment but 
the money is much more likely to stay put if it comes in as a 
direct investment rather than as foreign investment in the stock 
market or bond market said c fred bergsten a former treasury 
department official and the head of the institute 
the institutes study said foreign firms accounted for 7 percent 
of total us employment in manufacturing in 1986 the most recent 
year for which statistics were available that compared to 21 
percent in france 14 percent in britain and 13 percent in west 
germany 
however the researchers said that while japanese companies are 
investing heavily in the united states foreigncontrolled 
companies account for just 1 percent of manufacturing employment in 
japan a drop from 2 percent in 1977 
the heavy purchases by foreigners in particular the japanese 
have aroused concern in congress and elsewhere that the united 
states is selling its economic destiny to foreigners 
foreign direct investment totaled 89 percent of all 
nonfinancial corporations in the united states in 1988 up from 
21 percent in 1977 according to the commerce department 
rudy oswald chief economist at the aflcio said the institute 
was wrong to conclude that foreign investment is basically a benign 
influence on the us economy 
the united states is losing control of its own economic 
destiny in many ways oswald said it means that investment 
decisions are being made not in terms of what is necessarily good 
for a us firm but what is in the worldwide plan of a foreign 
firm 
the commerce department said foreign direct investment in us 
real estate and businesses totaled 3289 billion in 1988 compared 
with 3269 billion in us ownership overseas that was the first 
year that foreign direct ownership in the united states surpassed 
american investment abroad 
britain has the largest stake in the united states holding 31 
percent of total foreignheld assets while japan climbed to the 
no 2 spot with 162 percent of the total ahead of the 
netherlands which held 149 percent 
purchases of prime real estate and hollywood movie studios by 
the japanese grabbed the headlines but the most dramatic inroads 
by the japanese have come in banking according to the institutes 
study 
it reported that the japanese in 1988 controlled 522 percent of 
the us banking assets held by foreign banks far ahead of the 
second biggest foreign holder canada which controls 71 percent 
in all foreign banks controlled 192 percent of total american 
banking assets in 1988 up from 8 percent a decade earlier 
the institute for international economics is a nonprofit 
research institute created in 1981 it receives funding from the 
german marshall fund of the united states an independent endowment 
created by the west german government and various us 
corporations including the ford foundation

a former marine corps contracting 
official says he solicited more than 80000 in bribes to steer 
business to a defense firm and stashed some of the proceeds at home 
in his freezer 
i put it in the freezer in aluminum foil jack a sherman 
testified monday at the trial of two men accused of paying him 
bribes 
sherman a former civilian marine corps contracting official 
testified that he hid the cash in the freezer so his wife wouldnt 
find it 
i put it under the ice cubes it wasnt a large stack 
sherman told jurors 
sherman who is serving 18 months following his guilty plea to 
bribery charges said the rest of the money was placed in a credit 
union account 
the former pentagon official described how he negotiated with 
lee telecommunications to receive the bribes in return sherman 
said he approved the contract and later increased its value to give 
lee more work at a time when it was struggling financially 
his testimony came at the federal court trial of former lee vice 
president leonard l ingram and thomas muldoon the two are accused 
of participating in a sixyear bribery scheme that prosecutors said 
funneled more than 80000 to sherman 
ingrams attorney marcus topel told jurors in his opening 
statement that his client protested the bribe arrangements to 
company vice president scott lamberth and was told to mind his 
own business 
he is an innocent man who was in the wrong place at the wrong 
time topel said 
two former lee executives including lamberth have pleaded 
guilty to participating in the scheme along with a subsidiary of 
the whittaker corp which absorbed lee in 1986 
was the money paid in cash or checks asked prosecutor jack 
hanley 
it was always in cash sherman replied in most cases i 
was paid in the car riding around the block 
he said he first began taking illegal gratuities in 1974 and 
received his first bribe 800 in the late 1970s 
sherman said he discussed with lamberth the possibility of 
helping lee get a contract in 1981 
mr lamberth said if the contract could be expedited he would 
be able to pay me 75000 the money would be paid to a consultant 
i knew tom muldoon sherman said 
lamberth also promised a 10000 bonus if the contract was 
signed by a certain date sherman testified 
sherman said he and muldoon originally agreed to evenly split 
the money from lee but later muldoon complained that he needed a 
larger share to pay taxes so sherman said he took only onethird 
sherman could not recall all the payments he received but 
testified that he was paid about 25000 from muldoon he also 
arranged to be paid 800 a month by lee through john marlowe 
another defense consultant from fall 1985 to mid1987 
sherman said he couldnt recall doing anything specific for the 
money those payments were made to keep me interested in looking 
out for the best interests of the company he said 
sherman said he later arranged to split 5 percent of the value 
of a 1 million contract he steered to lee with defense consultant 
donald illeman who also has pleaded guilty 
while he usually dealt with lamberth who once paid him 4800 
sherman said he once discussed bribes with ingram 
sherman said he called ingram after lees estimate of the 
contracts cost abruptly went from 1 million to 16 million 
sherman admitted to defense attorney albert ahern that even 
after talking to the fbi when the investigation became public in 
june 1988 he attempted to collect bribe money from illeman 
sherman said illeman still owed him 4000 
you were so greedy you wanted to get that money ahern said 
yes sherman said 
you werent full of contrition then ahern said 
i was but i made the call sherman said

president jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras stalked out of a central american summit monday after a 
dispute with nicaraguan leader daniel ortega 
but a costa rican official said the two central american leaders 
resolved the dispute and azcona agreed to return to the gathering 
which dealt with the regions fragile peace process 
azconas spokesman marco tulio romero said the president 
walked out because nicaragua refused to promise to drop its case 
against honduras in the world court in the hague 
nicaragua has a case pending against honduras for harboring 
usbacked contra rebels romero said honduras has taken steps 
toward dismantling the contras and feels nicaragua should respond 
by dropping the suit 
after more than three hours ortega agreed to suspend the case 
for six months and azcona said he would return to the meeting 
according to the costa rican information minister jorge urbina 
there has never been a summit like this such a climate of 
confrontation urbana said 
earlier sources close to the talks said the five presidents 
hoped to reach an agreement that would keep the peace process 
alive even if the agreement did not resolve the conflicts 
sources in the nicaraguan salvadoran and costa rican 
delegations speaking on condition of anonymity had said an 
agreement to keep the 28monthold peace process going was likely 
the agreement might include a call for more un involvement they 
said 
another factor was the roles the kremlin and washington can play 
in achieving a peaceful solution a subject mentioned at the mass 
we know it does not depend on such distinguished citizens to 
bring us peace in central america the rev leonel chacon told 
the presidents attended by the presidents there are others and 
we ask them also in the name of god almighty to give us peace 
hundreds jammed the parish church in coronado a san jose 
suburb they clapped and cheered as presidents ortega oscar arias 
of costa rica azcona alfredo cristiani of el salvador and vinicio 
cerezo of guatemala entered 
in a message to arias on monday pope john paul ii noted the 
summit comes during a time of new tensions and painful 
conflicts in central america and said i wish to express my 
fervent hope that this meeting through a sincere and constructive 
dialogue contributes to rediscovering the road of peace 
the five presidents met in a long session monday to work out a 
final document based on at least three draft proposals the sources 
said 
the presidents discussed a proposal to ask the united states to 
halt all aid to contras fighting the leftist sandinista government 
in nicaragua the sources said cuba and the soviet union would be 
asked to halt intervention in central america 
some sources said the nicaraguans were willing to accept a 
loosely worded document implying they would not provide military 
aid to the salvadoran rebels but an end to us nonlethal aid to 
the contras was considered unlikely 
the salvadorans were discussing an agreement to work out a 
christmas truce with the rebels in exchange for a statement by the 
presidents criticizing the guerrillas for their bloody urban 
offensive in san salvador last month 
the presidents agreed last august to disband the contras by dec 
5 in exchange for democratization and a feb 25 election in 
nicaragua but the contras defied the agreement they were once 
again unrepresented as was el salvadors rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front known as fmln 
momentum toward peace has slowed since october with fighting 
renewed in both el salvador and nicaragua a suspension of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries and increasing 
campaign violence in nicaragua 
justice minister oscar santamaria of el salvador told the 
associated press his nation was willing to reestablish normal 
relations suspended after a nicaraguanregistered plane loaded 
with weapons for the fmln crashed nov 26 in el salvador 
nicaragua is demanding that the contras be demobilized by 
honduras or through a reinforced un force honduras says it wants 
to disband the force camped in its territory but wont use its 
army or shed honduran blood to do it 
a united nations observer group was sent to verify the peaceful 
repatriation of the contras to nicaragua and make sure no weapons 
were sent from one country to another to help insurgent groups 
the contras say no guarantees of democracy or freedom exist for 
them inside nicaragua and their presence is the only guarantee the 
feb 25 vote will be fair 
costa rica proposed a ceasefire in el salvador with un 
verification and guatemala suggested the united states cuba and 
the soviet union be asked to stop any kind of interference in the 
region as a contribution to the peace process 
the regional summit opened sunday

a former bolivian interior minister who allegedly 
hired nazi war criminal klaus barbie to teach torture techniques to 
death squads arrived here to face drug charges after being spirited 
out of his country 
luis arce gomez known as the minister of cocaine in bolivia 
after he allegedly created an elite paramilitary squad to 
confiscate cocaine from drug dealers who refused to pay him bribes 
landed in miami on monday night on a us drug enforcement plane 
said justice department spokesman dan eramian 
federal officials late monday refused to comment about the 
timing of his arraignment or any other details of his extradition 
the case was surrounded by tight security ordered from washington 
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the arrest of arce gomez sends a message that the president 
will work with other governments to pursue vigorously individuals 
who traffic in drugs the white house said in a statement 
bolivian president jaime paz zamora said arce gomez was expelled 
even though the two countries have no formal extradition treaty 
because the united states was the first country to bring charges 
against him 
arce gomezs whereabouts were unknown until his capture sunday 
at a ranch near santa cruz 350 miles east of the capital la paz 
clad in soccer shorts he offered no resistance when hundreds of 
police officers converged on the ranch where he was attending a 
family party 
we congratulate the government of bolivia for the capture 
said sen orrin hatch rutah one of five us senators in la paz 
on a oneday visit when arce gomez was put on the plane 
he was to be held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center south of miami pending arraignment on a 1983 
drugtrafficking indictment here officials said 
arce gomez who had a reputation for personally torturing 
political prisoners became his nations powerful minister of the 
interior when he and gen luis garcia mesa overthrew a civilian 
government in 1980 the rightwing government allegedly was 
financed by cocaine traffickers 
human rights groups say arce gomez directed bolivian death 
squads and hired barbie to advise the countrys paramilitary forces 
how to torture the forces murdered hundreds of journalists 
political and labor leaders and church officials according to 
human rights organziations 
barbie was later expelled to france where he is serving a life 
sentence for a conviction on crimes against humanity stemming from 
his days as gestapo chief in lyon 
arce gomez was removed as interior minister in 1981 under 
pressure from the us government when bolivia stripped him of his 
citizenship in 1982 he fled to argentina and was arrested under 
the miami indictment but he was freed in december 1983 in the 
final days of argentinas military regime 
the indictment accuses arce gomez along with 18 other people 
including his former top aide rene benitez of running a drug 
protection racket while he was interior minister he is 
specifically charged with two counts of conspiracy to import and 
distribute cocaine to florida he faces a maximum of 30 years in 
prison if convicted 
dea officials have said that arce gomez directed a multimillion 
dollar cocaine trafficking empire charging bolivias top five drug 
traffickers 75000 every two weeks in exchange for freedom to 
export cocaine 
two of his lieutenants charged in the indictment once received 
15 million for cocaine that was confiscated by bolivian 
authorities and stored in bank vaults according to the indictment 
the indictment said arce gomez personally ordered it released 
also named in the indictment is ana rodriguez de tamayo 50 who 
faces up to 30 years in prison and 50000 in fines if convicted of 
conspiracy to import possess and distribute cocaine she was 
extradited from colombia following colombian president virgilio 
barcos august crackdown against the cocaine cartels and remains 
held without bond in miami

a sixman ski and sled dog team messaged home 
here we are horrah after sliding to the bottom of the world 
the halfway point in their 4000mile attempt to make the first 
unmechanized crossing of antarctica 
the team led by minnesotan will steger and jeanlouis etienne 
of france sent the misspelled message by satellite after arriving 
at the south pole at 2 pm est monday a late spring day in the 
southern hemisphere 
we see it much as the first explorers did from the ground 
step by step fighting against its terrible elements and awed by 
its magnificent beauty the adventurers said about antarctica in 
a longer statement sent to the st paul headquarters two weeks ago 
and read monday at the us scottamundsen scientific research base 
scientists gave the international transantarctica expedition a 
tour of the dome station but little else was known about the 
groups arrival said cathy de moll from the expeditions st paul 
headquarters 
the group is the second to reach the south pole by dogsled 
roald amundsen did it on dec 14 1911 steger 45 made history 
three years ago when he led a similar assault on the north pole 
the team plans to stay at the south pole until friday but 
hasnt specified why 
we are surmising that they want to dry out their clothes and 
make sure their dogs are in really top form before they cross the 
area of inaccessibility de moll referring to a 850mile void of 
ice where neither radio nor airplane contact is guaranteed 
the adventurers have traveled 1992 miles from the tip of the 
antarctic peninsula where the trek began july 27 
the goal is to reach mirnyy a soviet science station on the 
continents indian ocean shore 
the second half is expected to go faster although part of it 
includes an uphill stretch from 10000 feet at the south pole to 
11500 feet at vostok the team could experience temperatures as 
low as minus 60 degrees 
the expedition is making its 11 million sevenmonth journey to 
bring world attention to antarctica and to demonstrate the power of 
international cooperation 
the adventurers directed a portion of their statement read 
monday at the pole to children we say to you take care of 
this your last great wilderness as if it were your own garden 
for in this place will grow the peace and knowledge we will use in 
order to survive 
the trek has been jeopardized somewhat by problems including 
breakdowns in air support 
at one point early in the expedition two of the teams three 
sleds were damaged in a crashing descent on ice and at another 
point a french doctor had to descend into an ice crevasse to 
rescue a stranded sled dog 
but a statement monday night from the st paul headquarters said 
things were going better and the team was only 10 days behind 
schedule they hope to finish the expedition by march 1

raul silvio vivas of argentina who was extradited from uruguay 
despite escalating antiextradition terrorism is named in 26 
counts contained in two federal indictments 
the 39yearold vivas entered his pleas monday before two judges 
and listened through an interpreter as assistant us attorney 
russell hayman described the charges vivas is accused of being a 
top member of the medellin cartels moneylaundering operations 
for at least two years beginning in 1985 he used his 
moneychanging house in montevideo to launder cocaine profits from 
the united states disguising them by real or paper gold 
transactions hayman told us district judge william d keller 
there was about 250 million laundered in this manner 
hayman said we have bank records supporting those figures 
a second indictment to which vivas pleaded innocent before 
judge consuelo marshall alleges another 250 million was 
laundered hayman said he said he did not know why the fbi earlier 
had said vivas was involved in laundering 1 billion 
vivas attorney martin l schmukler suggested he might ask 
that vivas be tried separately from other defendants all told 32 
people many from los angeles downtown jewelry district are named 
in the indictments along with one corporation 
but keller said he was unlikely to sever vivas case and told 
schmukler to return to his court today to consult with other 
defense attorneys who planned to ask that evidence from wiretaps 
be thrown out keller tentatively set trial for jan 27 
vivas was arrested in february and had fought extradition since 
march in a uruguayan jail 
asked if vivas had done business with the other defendants 
schmukler said if he did they were professional dealings not 
criminal dealings 
uruguayan national police turned vivas over to fbi agents at a 
naval base under heavy guard friday and he was flown to california 
that night 
just two days earlier a bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers 
killed dozens and wounded hundreds outside colombias police 
intelligence headquarters a group of drug lords calling themselves 
the extraditables has been waging a campaign of bombings and 
assassinations to force the government to end its war on the cartel 
the us indictment issued in february charges vivas and the 
others with carrying out the largest colombian drug cartel money 
laundering operation ever uncovered by american law enforcement 
authorities several defendants already have pleaded guilty

joseph j krajsa knows whats needed once 
a noncommunist government is installed in czechoslovakia 
electronic equipment 
their biggest problem is communications they need to 
communicate with the rest of the world said krajsa who with his 
father joseph c krajsa manages the communications arm of the 
first catholic slovak union of the united states and canada 
the union known as jednota already has sent people to europe 
to arrange additional contacts and try to get issues of its weekly 
newspaper into czechoslovakia 
the country one of those leading the way to eastern bloc 
liberalization as its ruling communist party gives up its monopoly 
on power is a union of two republics one predominantly ethnic 
czech the other slovak 
when the time is right the 105000member american organization 
may invest in the country to help start publishing enterprises and 
send in up to 500000 copies of its newspaper and slovak history 
and language books the krajsas said recently 
they have no reference point said the younger krajsa 42 
referring to the rigorous censorship and information blackout 
imposed by the communist regime during the past 40 years 
for example one young worker at jednota who recently emigrated 
from czechoslovakia didnt know who reformist party chief alexander 
dubcek was until she arrived in this country dubcek was ousted 
when his prague spring reforms were crushed by a sovietled 
invasion in 1968 
were seeing what we can do and how we can help educate their 
people as fast as we can the son said adding that jednota has 
the computerized publishing equipment to quickly print materials in 
the slovak language 
he said the united states should send czechoslovakia facsimile 
machines computers and other informationage equipment the rest of 
the world takes for granted 
in addition university chairs in english should be established 
at slovakian universities a slovak chair at the university of 
pittsburgh was recently established and its first project was a new 
text to teach slovak the son said 
with obvious pride he noted that the popular uprising that took 
10 years in poland and 10 weeks in germany took 10 days in 
czechoslovakia 
the country formed out of the wreckage of the austrohungarian 
empire after world war i was considered the most democratic in 
eastern europe until a portion of it was surrendered to hitler in 
1938 and fell entirely to the nazis soon afterward communists 
overwhelmed a postworld war ii coalition government in 1948 
theyre used to seeking freedom said the elder krajsa 72 
who has worked for jednota for 30 years 
the newspaper and commercial printing division are located in a 
modern building and warehouse on a hillside outside middletown the 
unions headquarters is in independence ohio near cleveland 
where the union was founded in 1890 by the rev stephen furdek from 
eight independent slovak catholic societies and lodges 
the younger krajsa manages jednota press the commercial 
printing division the father is editor of the 38000circulation 
newspaper 
seeing their homeland move to the verge of new freedom while 
gratifying is not surprising the krajsas said 
history shows that it happens the elder krajsa said 
adds the son i feel very excited for them

a 65 million navigation satellite 
was rocketed into orbit joining the air forces network of 
spacecraft that guide bombers warships missiles and ground troops 
with precision accuracy 
the fifth of a series of navstar spacecraft was boosted into 
space monday by a delta 2 rocket the satellite settled into an 
orbit reaching 11000 miles high 
everything appears to have gone very well with the flight 
said lt col ron rand the air force launch commentator 
after about a month of checkout by ground stations the new 
navstar will join the four earlier spacecraft in providing us and 
allied military units information that allows them to pinpoint 
their locations within 50 feet anywhere on earth in any weather 
planes ships submarines tanks and field soldiers can tune in 
on the networks positioning radio signals with receivers as small 
as a handheld telephone in some places the signals can be 
accurate within 10 feet 
the 3675pound satellites also keep track of the speed of 
military vehicles within a fraction of a mile per hour and tell 
them the time accurate to within a millionth of a second 
military users receive information from a coded channel 
civilian users such as operators of boats and private aircraft also 
have access to the system but they monitor an open channel 
providing less accurate information to within 300 feet of their 
position 
users must wait until one or more of the satellites is within 
radio range leaving occasional gaps in coverage there will be no 
interruption when the air force completes the 21satellite network 
by 1992 launches are planned about once every two months

cardinal john j oconnor whose sermon was 
disrupted by abortionrights and aids activists inside st 
patricks cathedral said demonstrators would halt services over 
my dead body 
city officials also denounced the activists who sprawled in the 
aisles of the cathedral during sunday mass some of the 
demonstrators chained themselves to pews or hurled condoms one 
threw a communion wafer on the floor 
if their aim is to change church teaching they cant 
accomplish that oconnor said monday 
about 4500 marched outside protesting the roman catholic 
churchs policies on aids abortion contraception and 
homosexuality and 111 were arrested 43 inside the church 
mayor edward koch mayorelect david dinkins and gov mario 
cuomo were among those calling the demonstration inside the 
cathedral an affront to religion and an infringement on worshipers 
first amendment rights 
koch who attended the mass to demonstrate his support though he 
is jewish said to think that youre going to change the beliefs 
of the catholic church by disrupting a service makes no sense and 
it is not acceptable it doesnt come in under any protected first 
amendment rights 
said dinkins a peaceful demonstration an expression of ones 
views is one thing but one ought not disrupt a religious 
ceremony 
cuomo while noting terrible anguish of aids and the 
complex and emotional debate on abortion said even the 
awful provocation emanating from these issues does not justify the 
outrage of desecrating egregiously a religious service and its 
worshipers 
the protest was organized by two groups known for vocal 
demonstrations the aids coalition to unleash power actup and 
womens health action and mobilization wham 
oconnor called the demonstration the worst of many he had seen 
at the cathedral 
they will stop the mass over my dead body he said 
i cant imagine a day that the church will change its position 
on contraception oconnor said the church will certainly not 
change its position on homosexual behavior it will not change its 
position on abortion 
even some of the protesters said those inside st patricks went 
too far 
john kelly a spokesman for actup acknowledged that a lot in 
the group were disturbed by what went on inside the cathedral 
but thats their right to protest 
we werent attempting in any way to change the churchs 
teaching kelly said but oconnor is taking church teaching 
and forcing it on the people of new york city who dont necessarily 
share his beliefs 
he said the churchs attitude fostered ignorance about aids 
andy humm spokesman for the coalition for lesbian and gay 
rights said the 50group coalition supported the protest outdoors 
but unequivocably condemned the splinter group inside st 
patricks 
humm said the cardinals position on aids education and abortion 
must be protested vigorously but that does not excuse the 
violation of anyones right to pray as they choose

the leader of a violent drug gang was convicted 
of ordering the murder of a rookie police officer whose badge is 
kept by president bush as a symbol of the war on illegal drugs 
howard pappy mason who commands a crack gang called the 
bebos was found guilty by a federal jury monday of all 11 counts 
including murder conspiracy racketeering and possessing and 
distrubuting drugs he faces a mandatory term of life in prison 
without parole for the death of officer edward byrne 22 
at the verdict tears welled in the eyes of byrnes father 
matthew who gave his slain sons police shield to 
thenpresidential candidate george bush after the feb 26 1988 
slaying the president keeps the badge in his oval office desk as a 
reminder of the perils of the drug war 
mason who boycotted the trial appeared unmoved as he watched 
the verdict announced on closedcircuit television from a holding 
cell said deputy us marshal michael pizzi 
he didnt flinch he just sat there pizzi said 
matthew byrne and his wife ann left the courthouse without 
comment after thanking prosecutors 
byrne was shot five times in the head as he sat in a car 
guarding the home of a witness in a drug case 
prosecutors said mason ordered the attack to solidify his 
position of leadership of the bebos four members of the gang were 
convicted earlier this year in state court of carrying out the 
killing and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison 
i hope this sends a message to people who are willing to give 
the orders that there is a high price to pay said assistant us 
attorney leslie r caldwell 
testimony during the trial of the four killers said the order to 
kill came from masons cell at the brooklyn house of detention he 
had been convicted on a weapons charge and jailed two days before 
the slaying 
the prosecutions key witness against mason viola nichols told 
the jury he had directed the murder because another patrolman had 
disrespected him in front of his colleagues by upbraiding him 
for drinking beer in public her brother lorenzo fat cat 
nichols was one of the four already convicted 
defense lawyer harry c batchelder jr asked judge edward r 
korman to set the verdict aside saying mason was mentally 
incompetent to participate in his twoweek trial korman denied the 
motion on 10 of the counts but reserved decision on the the murder 
charge

the image that lingers is of flares five of them 
were spotted during the coast guards search for five lobstermen 
that came and went like shooting stars 
the rescuers who gave up their search after 11 days are now 
haunted by the reminder that out on the sea its just you and the 
will to live 
each flare sighting raised hopes that turned to frustration as 
hundreds of searchers scanned thousands of miles of ocean without 
success when the search for the stonington connbased heidi 
marie was finally suspended dec 1 disappointment and questions 
about the failed effort remained 
its not as easy as seeing a flare and then finding it said 
coast guard lt christopher stickney one of the pilots who logged 
hours in the air during the search 
you turn the plane in that direction but you really have no 
idea how far away it is he said you only see the flare 
momentarily almost like if you were in your car and saw 
lightning in the distance 
with every passing hour the odds against finding survivors grew 
slimmer 
you just feel this incredible pressure because youre trying 
constantly to get caught up with the situation because the search 
area grows larger and larger the potential drift areas grow and 
the information going into designing the mission grows stickney 
said 
during the height of the search stickney spent his onduty 
hours absorbed in mathematics and probabilities he and his flight 
crew focused solely on resisting the lull of mile after mile of 
greenishgray sea and preventing their vision from blurring before 
an endless stretch of horizon 
youre right on the edge and you just keep thinking ive got 
to stay alert ive got to concentrate because the next time you 
glance left you could spot a life raft stickney said 
but sometimes the fates conspire against coast guard missions 
turbulent air jostles planes or 20foot seas and windwhipped water 
obscure the view sometimes as was the case with the heidi marie 
what seems a hot trail suddenly turns cold 
the search planes are equipped with hightech radar infrared 
heatdetecting sensors and data marker buoys to track conditions at 
sea but mostly the rescuers rely on their eyes pilots scanning 
from the cockpit and observers peering through 3foot windows 
their backs get sore and their eyes strain against 
lateafternoon shadows and hours of staring into the glare of 
clouds then snow then brilliant blue sky 
because the heidi maries life raft was made of cloth it was 
undetectable on radar because it was so small their field of 
vision was limited to about a mile off either wing 
the weight of constant risk also tires coast guard searchers 
the only thing separating us the searchers from them the 
people in the raft is a few hundred feet of water stickney 
said it could be us lost out there and it could be our wives 
waiting for the phone to ring 
the five missing lobstermens families are no longer waiting 
the days and nights of waiting are over 
the rescuers now live with the imagined faces of unknown sailors 
it isnt a pretty picture to think of what they were going 
through said lt bennett bonomi a pilot who was among those 
searching for the heidi marie the sea is so big and youre 
at the mercy of the elements its just you and the will to live

negotiators have picked an isolated site to 
trade the kidnapped daughter of a senior cabinet minister for 
jailed moslem militants a top state official said today 
disagreements over the site of the exchange had stalled the 
exchange and an end to the kidnapping the first crisis for the 
10dayold government of prime minister vp singh 
chief secretary moosa raza the topranking bureaucrat in 
jammukashmir state said negotiators for the government and the 
militant kashmir liberation front at midday finally resolved 
differences and agreed to an isolated site 
he declined to give specifics but said the exchange could take 
place at any moment 
militants have demanded freedom for five to eight militants 
being held in prisons in exchange for rubaiya sayeed the 
22yearold daughter of home minister mufti homahhad sayeed 
ms sayeed a medical intern was abducted at gunpoint on friday 
in srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir state srinagar is 
about 95 miles north of jammu the states winter capital 
the front was formed in 1965 and is demanding that 
jammukashmir the only indian state with a moslem majority either 
become independent or part of neighboring pakistan an islamic 
nation 
as negotiations continued the government moved three of the 
militants from a jammu jail to srinagar 
the kashmir liberation front is demanding the release of abdul 
hamid sheikh the groups top leader who was arrested last month 
after being wounded in a clash with police he is in a srinagar 
hospital 
but sheikh asked relatives to tell the government he did not 
want to be part of any deal police sources said sheikh said the 
government once certain ms sayeed was safe would only arrest him 
again the sources said 
the other militants are noor mohammed kalwal mohammed altaf 
javed ahmed zargar sher mohammed azad and ghulam nabi butt the 
name of the seventh militant was not immediately known 
all have been arrested during the past year and are suspected of 
subversive and secessionist activities although none have been 
charged 
ms sayeeds abduction occurred three days after her father was 
appointed home minister a key post that oversees the countrys 
internal security 
he is the first moslem to hold the job the appointment was seen 
as a part of prime minister vp singhs efforts to appease moslems 
who have borne the brunt of hindumoslem religious riots this fall 
the kidnapping came a day after sayeed was appointed the head of 
a government committee set up to try to end separatist campaigns in 
jammukashmir and neighboring punjab where sikh militants are 
demanding an independent nation 
moslems make up 64 percent of the state but nationwide comprise 
only 11 percent of the population hindus comprise 80 percent of 
indias 880 million people 
kashmir is claimed both by india and pakistan and the two 
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they 
gained independence from britain in 1947

a valedictorian who married instead of 
using a scholarship that was good at any college in the state 
surprised gustavus adolphus college officials recently when she 
showed them the 1953 certificate 
they didnt know anything about it but decided to honor it 
lois kirschstein married her high school sweetheart elmer 
kirschstein after graduating as valedictorian at st peter high 
school 
it drove the high school teachers and the principal nuts 
kirschstein said i wasnt supposed to do that but i never 
regretted i did 
her husband died last summer and the 54yearold kirschstein 
began searching for something to do with her life the search 
crystallized when she found the faded scholarship certificate 
there was no expiration date so she decided to try and put it to 
use at gustavus 
at first college officials told me it was no good even if 
there was no expiration date it was only good in the year i 
applied for it said kirschstein a grandmother of 10 who lives 
in the southcentral minnesota town of morgan i told them that i 
never applied it was a gift so i sent a copy of it to the 
college 
we had never seen one of these said owen sammelson vice 
president for administration but we talked it over and since 
there was no date we decided to accept it we are delighted that 
shes doing this 
mark anderson director of admissions said the college has 
waived its requirement for standardized college entrance exams 
she is a topnotch student and i am sure she will enrich any 
classroom anderson said i saw her transcript and there 
wasnt a b on there it was straight as 
kirschstein plans to major in history and religion at gustavus 
this year tuition at gustavus is about 10300 kirschsteins 
scholarship will cover 5150 in 1953 the scholarships cash 
value would have been only 225 half of the colleges 450 annual 
tuition 
kirschstein chose gustavus because of its lutheran roots and its 
proximity to her home she plans to rent a small apartment in st 
peter which is 50 miles east of morgan and go home on weekends 
after raising four children kirschstein isnt worried about 
communicating with the other freshmen but she is nervous 
im scared to death kirschstein said i dont know i may 
go a semester and think this is just nuts but i dont think god is 
done with me yet and this seems like a good place to find out

a spotlight searches the big city skyline as a 
highpowered jazz prelude including some fine scat singing fills 
the theater then gun shots and sirens finally the toughguy 
monotone of a private detective right out of raymond chandler or 
dashiell hammett is heard 
its the opening of city of angels the hardboiled private 
eye musical that barreled into broadways virginia theater on 
monday night its an ambitious show even an innovative one from 
creators cy coleman larry gelbart and david zippel 
thats not to say city of angels is perfect the evening 
runs on too long and the main character needs more definition 
and a little more heart but you wont find a more original musical 
on broadway 
the place is los angeles the time the late 1940s a 
disillusioned hollywood screenwriter named stine would rather write 
mystery novels about a fictional gumshoe named stone than toil as a 
hack for an unscrupulous movie producer but he needs the money 
after all stine says didnt fitzgerald and faulkner work in the 
movies 
but then did their creations sing and dance city of angels 
brings stines fictional detective to life the audience sees both 
stines real life and the world he is forced to create for the 
silver screen 
stine played with nerdish charm by gregg edelman has a 
soulmate in stone james naughton gives the shows best performance 
as the rakish detective youre nothing without me the two men 
sing together in one of the musicals more persistent melodies and 
the show confirms their dependence on each other 
gelbart has concocted an ingenious often very funny book its 
a splitlevel story that satirizes the world of hollywood film 
making as well as the heros and convoluted plots of detective 
fiction 
all the other major performers play two roles stines 
longsuffering wife kay mcclelland resembles a torch singer the 
detective stone desires stones gal friday randy graff is 
similiar to the woman who works for that big time movie producer 
rene auberjonois the producer in turn also appears in even 
more grotesque form as a character in stines movie script 
auberjonois gets most of gelbarts best zingers as the 
egomaniacal producer who wants to rewrite stines script while 
graff and mcclelland suffer beautifully in song 
city of angels is colemans most tightly constructed score 
a big improvement over his much more conventional melodies for last 
seasons flop welcome to the club 
the numbers lushly orchestrated by billy byers suggest the 
1940s from big ballad crooning like stay with me to a torch 
number like with every breath i take to an oldfashioned 
musical comedy song like you can always count on me 
zippels lyrics evoke the same period lushly romantic in the 
ballads and sharp and sassy in the comedy songs 
director michael blakemore and his production team set 
designer robin wagner costume designer florence klotz and lighting 
designer paul gallo have separated the worlds ingeniously 
stones film world is black and white stines real world is in 
living color and occasionally they collide most effectively at 
the end of the show on an impressive soundstage where reality and 
fantasy merge its then that stine the author decides to say 
no to what hollywood is doing to stone the detective 
like its hero city of angels takes a chance from colemans 
scintillating thematically linked score to gelbarts ingenious 
multilayered story the show doesnt play safe and thats more 
than you can say for most of the musicals in town 
in other reviews 
the new york times frank rich wondered how long has it been 
since a musical was brought to a halt by riotous jokes he 
praised gelbart for his endlessly witty wordplay and composer 
coleman for a delirious celebration of jazz and pop styles 
the new york posts clive barnes praised the cast as good and 
said the play had taste resonance and imagination but the 
one thing it doesnt completely do is work what we have here 
are a bunch of ideas searching for fulfillment he wrote 
the daily news howard kissel said he didnt have a good 
time at the contrived parody

wrongfuldeath lawsuit by the survivors of silme domingo and gene 
viernes the men opponents of marcos regime were shot to death 
in offices of the alaska cannery workers union in june 1981 
three men were convicted of murder on the theory that domingo 
and viernes were victims of an internal union dispute involving 
work assignments and gambling in alaska fish canneries 
but the us district court lawsuit which seeks 30 million 
accuses the late philippine president his widow imelda and 
others of orchestrating the deaths because of domingos and 
viernes antimarcos activism 
gillego testified that the two men would have been tracked by 
marcos intelligence agents in the united states 
he said that generally those agents tactics ranged from 
gentle persuasion to action that would even include extreme 
measures 
asked if that included executions or disappearances of 
antimarcos activists gillego replied that is correct 
gillego had been part of the antimarcos opposition keeping 
track of philippines intelligence activities and lived underground 
in the philippines and in exile in the united states after marcos 
declared martial law in 1972 
after marcos was overthrown he was named executive director of 
president corazon aquinos overseas philippine presidential 
commission on good government which was charged with recovering 
marcos wealth in the united states 
marcos attorney richard hibey objected to much of gillegos 
testimony as hearsay since gillego lacks personal knowledge about 
the particular case but judge barbara rothstein allowed most 
answers as long as they were labeled as gillegos expert opinion 
gillego testified about several documents seized from philippine 
government files after marcos overthrow in february 1986 he 
described them as typical of the kind of intelligence reports 
prepared by philippine consulates in the united states and sent to 
manila 
domingos name appeared in several documents gillego testified 
including one identifying him as washington coordinator of the 
antimarcos union of democratic filipinos gillego said 
domingos and viernes union was a local of the international 
longshoremens and warehousemens union which gillego described as 
a prime target of marcos intelligence because its members had 
been known to refuse to load or unload commodities from countries 
whose politics they opposed 
their elections as union officers would be an important event 
that would be easily reported by philippine intelligence 
agents he said

the soviet parliament today rejected a bid by 
reformers to follow several eastern european countries and one 
soviet republic in striking the communist partys monopoly on power 
from the constitution 
the rebuff was a victory for president mikhail s gorbachev who 
wants the congress of peoples deputies to focus on the nations 
severe economic problems 
the congress on the first day of a 10day session refused to 
include on its agenda a discussion of article 6 of the 
constitution which calls the communist party the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its political 
system 
but the vote 1139 to 839 indicated the idea has gained 
strength among the deputies who were elected in march fiftysix 
abstained 
poet yevgeny yevtushenko supporting a move by deputies from the 
baltic republics and the reformist interregional deputies group 
said authority must not be only written into one paragraph but 
proven every day 
he later called the vote a noble defeat since 87 percent of 
the congress deputies are party members we got 839 votes 
yevtushenko said i didnt expect that 
the baltic republic of lithuania last week became the first of 
the soviet unions 15 republics to replace article 6 with one that 
allows a multiparty system 
as changes sweep eastern europe partly at gorbachevs behest 
hungary east germany and czechoslovakia have ended the communist 
monopoly on power and poland selected the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister on monday bulgarias leadership 
proposed a multiparty system 
gorbachev said any issue was open to debate but warned against 
thinking that eliminating article 6 would solve all the countrys 
troubles 
we cannot start political speculation he said 
he urged the congress instead to concentrate on a government 
plan to straighten out the countrys economic mess which was to be 
presented later by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
we need drastic reforms gorbachev said so far there are 
no improvements in this area 
ryzhkovs deputy economist leonid abalkin has developed a 
detailed plan to make the soviet ruble convertible on world 
markets jettison moneylosing staterun businesses and fill empty 
store shelves 
but congress also rejected efforts by reformers to discuss key 
pieces of the economic reform including proposed laws on property 
ownership and land that came before the supreme soviet legislature 
this fall 
key economic laws have been submitted for public discussion and 
gorbachev said they could be adopted next spring 
of more than 2000 deputies 1387 voted against dicussing the 
laws on land and property during the session a total of 537 
supported it and 68 abstained 
the debate over land and property led to an acrimonious exchange 
between gorbachev and human rights activist andrei d sakharov 
sakharov has demanded an end to the communist partys monopoly 
on power he urged a twohour general strike monday to show support 
for the idea but the strike fizzled 
sakharov urged the deputies to debate all the articles 
hindering the passing of laws on land property and other bills 
promoting perestroika 
when he began to speak about article 6 gorbachev cut him short 
with a curt thank you who is to define what articles to 
exclude he asked 
sakharov then handed gorbachev a stack of telegrams in support 
of his position 
you come to me i will give you three files of telegrams 
gorbachev retorted 
the interregional group which claims about 400 deputies as 
members decided over the weekend not to endorse the strike 
members said they didnt want to provoke a public already grumbling 
over economic hardship 
instead the deputies called on soviets to use meetings 
demonstrations letters and telegrams to the congress and other 
means to demand that article 6 and other the key reform laws be 
put on the agenda 
behind closed doors progressives also agreed on tactics to 
force discussion of their agenda i cannot reveal information to 
you on the tactics an interregional group activist said monday 
night that was the purpose of the closed session so the 
information wouldnt leak you will see the tactics tomorrow during 
the live broadcast 
televised live to the nation the inaugural session of congress 
this summer gave voice to a litany of soviet woes as some deputies 
denounced and others defended the kgb seven decades of 
communist rule and the crimes of josef stalin 
perhaps chastened officials have decided to broadcast only the 
opening proceedings of the winter session live deputies themselves 
will debate how much of the rest to show the country

two independent opposition parties 
today announced their formation in serbia defying hardline 
communist policies in the largest yugoslav republic 
also today the national communist party called for 
reconciliation between serbia and reformist slovenia the partys 
ruling politburo also said the situation in the country is 
characterized by strained ethnic relations and tendencies toward 
the countrys disintegration 
thirteen prominent belgrade intellectuals announced they were 
forming the democratic party while a group within the official 
serbian socialist youth organization is establishing the movement 
for the democratic renewal 
serbias communist authorities headed by president slobodan 
milosevic have in the past vehemently opposed introduction of 
westernstyle political pluralism in the southern republic 
several independent political and human rights groups have been 
banned in serbia and some of the activists are being prosecuted for 
taking part in the illegal work of the organizations 
it is unclear how the two new parties will operate in view of 
continuing opposition from the authorities 
snezana aleksic an ideologist for serbias communists told a 
gathering monday that the formation of independent political 
parties will lead to the breakup of yugoslavia 
in contrast the authorities in the northern republics of 
slovenia and croatia have lent their support to the establishment 
of opposition parties that are to contest the firstever multiparty 
elections early next year 
croatias communist leadership at its congress under way in 
zagreb for the first time openly urged the establishment of a 
parliamentary democracy in yugoslavia 
representatives of both newly formed serbian parties said at 
separate news conferences held in belgrade that they are striving 
for the full legalization of multiparty pluralism free elections 
freedom of the press and the guaranteeing of human rights 
a commentary by the countrys leading danas news weekly said the 
establishment of independent groups in serbia represents the first 
sign of the weakening within the republic of milosevics brand of 
communist orthodoxy 
milosevic has built up his popularity in serbia by claiming he 
is fighting for the return of serbian dignity which was 
allegedly humiliated by other national and ethnic groups within 
yugoslavia especially by slovenes and croats 
in an unprecedented move in the history of this country serbia 
this month severed all business and political ties with the liberal 
republic of slovenia in an apparent attempt to stifle the growing 
reform sentiment in yugoslavia 
the serbian action brought fears of the breakup of this loose 
federation of six republics several ethnic groups and religions 
the state department said in washington monday that it was 
worried by rising tensions in yugoslavia and urged the people to 
unite in support of the countrys reformist premier ante markovic 
markovic has been under strong pressure from conservatives 
within the countrys communist party who oppose his efforts to 
create a marketoriented economy and to promote greater political 
pluralism

in a parliament that was once lowtech and 
rubberstamp a computerized voting system got off to a bumpy start 
today 
president mikhail s gorbachev had to explain the system three 
times before the 2106 attending members of the congress of 
peoples deputies got it right 
the deputies were to insert their identity cards into handheld 
votecounters press a button to register their names then press 
another button indicating yes no or abstain before 
handing the machine to the next person 
gorbachev first asked the deputies to simply register their 
names the result was 333 for 11 against and six abstentions the 
remaining 1756 apparently pushed no button at all 
gorbachev explained the system again and the second time 1985 
names were recorded 
maybe some people still have to learn but we are on the right 
track he said 
as a backup gorbachev instructed that a committee be formed to 
count votes by hand the oldfashioned way just in case the 
system fails during the 10day session

the state inspector general is investigating 
allegations the new york national guard used phantom troops to 
garner extra federal money 
but lt col peter kutschera chief spokesman for the new york 
national guard said the guard is clearing out its deadwood and 
resents any implication that it intentionally padded its troop 
rosters 
the new york post reported monday that noshow soldiers have 
been kept on the rosters for at least six years giving the 
pentagon the false impression that the guard is ready for war or 
national disaster 
the state inspector general is looking at it and because of 
this pending investigation it would be inappropriate for us to 
comment any further said steve villano spokesman for gov mario 
cuomo villano said other investigations had been conducted 
we take sharp exception to this kutschera said of the 
newspaper report to imply that this is a sham or conscious 
effort to mislead the pentagon isnt borne out by the facts 
the one thing that is particularly disturbing is the assertion 
or implication that the new york army national guard is not ready 
to meet its wartime mission is not combat ready he said the 
vast number are adjudged combatready by our supervisory commands 
the post said the new york national guards budget has tripled 
since 1975 to 390 million a year 
the newspaper said a phantom force was created in 1984 by vito 
castellano who was commander from 1975 to 1986 and reportedly 
retired under pressure it said between 1600 and 4000 noshow 
guardsmen in the state still are awol and should be dismissed 
noshows are not paid but the post said the pentagon provides 
funds for their equipment and training which kutschera said was 
not true 
federal money for equipment allocated to the national guard is 
not based on drill attendance but on the authorized level of 
equipment in the organization itself he said 
he said that local commanders in an effort to keep personnel 
strength up have been reluctant to discharge guardsmen for 
unauthorized absences because it is costeffective to 
rehabilitate or bring somebody back whom youve already spent money 
on 
but the effort was not particularly successful and the 
guard has been speeding up the discharge of such guardsmen he said 
he said the guard has 18900 members and about 1523 missed 
more than nine drills a year 
castellano was released from prison in july after serving one 
year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for wedtech 
corp the nowdefunct defense contractor 
there was no answer at a suburban telephone under castellanos

a tokyo art dealer paid 59 million today for an 
8th century porcelain horse a record price for chinese art 
sothebys auctioneers said 
the price for the tang dynasty horse stolen and chipped by 
thieves last month was three times higher than sothebys estimate 
and twice the previous record for chinese art an auction house 
spokesman said 
the buyer was identified only as mr shimojo of shimojos art 
dealers in tokyo

solidarity leader lech walesa said today 
that the government should be granted special economic powers 
allowing it to restructure the economy without the approval of 
parliament 
walesa said he was fully aware how controversial this proposal 
is but i am forced to make it because of the everworsening 
situation in the country and the growing impatience of society 
it was not known whether the solidarityled government of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki supported walesas position 
the government is drafting economic reform legislation for 
presentation to the sejm or lower house of parliament this 
weekend 
parliament would have to grant the government special powers to 
restructure the economy 
walesa argued that legislative debate was slowing the adoption 
of laws necessary to end polands economic crisis 
the situation in the country is getting worse time is running 
out the reserve of social trust is nearly expired he said in a 
statement issued by solidarity union headquarters in gdansk 
that is why one should act quickly and with determination 
walesa said i propose giving the government extraordinary 
powers 
he said the powers would apply to restructuring the economy 
banking and local government changing the property system and 
ending the monopoly on staterun and cooperative enterprises 
walesa said parliament should grant the powers for a specific 
period of time lawmakers then could turn their attention to 
longerterm laws while retaining the right to correct acts of the 
government he said 
one effect of such powers would be to lessen the influence of 
the communist party and its formerly allied parties in overseeing 
economic policy 
mazowieckis government is dominated by solidarity supporters 
who hold half of the 24 cabinet seats the communists hold four 
in the sejm however solidarity has 35 percent of the seats and 
the communists 37 percent 
there were signs last week that some of the governments radical 
economic programs would have trouble in the sejm because of the 
strength of communist party loyalists 
for instance some members of the party and its former allies 
spoke against a government bill that would break up nationwide 
unions of cooperatives 
the unions of cooperatives set prices and act as virtual 
monopolies in many economic sectors including food sales and 
retailing and are a source of patronage dominated by party 
loyalists 
the governments reform plan calls for breaking up the 
monopolies one result would be that dairies and food stores would 
have to compete against one another

communists responsible for 21 
years of hardline policy resigned from their last powerful posts 
today as parliament considered how to select a new president 
playwright vaclav havel riding a wave of popular support as 
leader of the opposition civic forum has offered to serve as 
president until free elections can be held next year more of his 
posters appeared in the capital today 
slovakias regional parliament today asked the federal assembly 
or national parliament to consider former communist leader 
alexander dubcek for president and called him the most important 
figure of modern czechoslovak history the government news agency 
ctk said dubcek was ousted after prague spring reforms were 
crushed by soviet tanks in 1968 
hardline communist president gustav husak resigned sunday after 
swearing in a cabinet that for the first time in four decades was 
dominated by noncommunists 
the new government was a historic victory for the nations 
opposition movement which has forced the government to open 
borders promise free elections and revoke the communists 
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society 
late monday the club of communist deputies a caucus of the 
communists who dominate the 350member federal assembly demanded 
the new president be chosen by nationwide referendum ctk said 
prior to the announcement it was expected that the lawmaking 
body dominated by communists and traditionally a rubberstamp 
body for communist policy would select the interim president 
it was unclear whether or how the deputies would vote on the 
issue at the session that opened today with the resignation of 
ousted communist party chief milos jakes and other hardliners from 
their last positions of power as members of the parliaments 
guiding presidium 
jakes and former ideology chief vasil bilak sat stonefaced as 
their fellow deputies in the house of nations one of two 
constituent bodies of the parliament accepted their resignations 
on monday in the first act of retribution against hardliners 
who crushed the prague spring bilak was charged for his part 
in the crackdown the state news agency ctk said 
according to some opinions his deeds can be considered 
treason ctk said without detailing the charges against bilak 
bilak who resigned from the partys ruling politburo last year 
is widely believed to be the czechoslovak communist who lent most 
support to the august 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed reform 
bilak now 72 will not however face trial for this 
wrongdoing ctk said because of the countrys statute of 
limitations for crimes committed more than 20 years ago although 
ctk did not explain the anomaly of charging someone with a crime he 
cannot be prosecuted for it appeared to be a symbolic attribution 
of guilt 21 years after the invasion 
the slovak communist party daily pravda today said bilak put 
shame on the party it said he acquired a large villa for 
20000 after the government renovated it for 10 times as much 
new posters bearing a portrait of havel and his motto truth 
and love must prevail over lies and hatred appeared all over 
central prague today 
havels face smiled from posters plastered to walls and windows 
throughout central prague over the caption havel na hrad or 
havel to the castle the presidential residence 
on monday the civic forum opposition group issued a statement 
backing havel but stressing any president chosen now would have to 
resign before free elections 
on sunday havel addressed 100000 cheering supporters from a 
balcony overlooking wenceslas square 
small groups of demonstrators supporting havel for president 
took to the streets on monday in prague pilsen and brno 
meanwhile havel himself began sounding more like a national 
leader than a member of the opposition 
in an interview with soviet television also shown on 
czechoslovak television monday the playwright reassured leaders in 
moscow that if elected he would remain a member of the warsaw 
pact 
our ideal is europe as a peaceful community that ultimately 
requires a dissolution of blocs havel said 
but he added we understand that we shall not get any closer 
to this ideal by any kind of individual split from the warsaw 
treaty longing for some kind of immediate and individual 
neutrality 
several other names have also been floated for president 
including ladislav adamec the former premier who agreed to add 
noncommunists to his government but then resigned and cestmir 
cisar expelled from the communist party in 1970 after serving as 
the students candidate for president in 1968 
but havel 53 and dubcek 68 were seen as two most serious 
contenders 
politburo member ondrej saling told reporters that a meeting 
between communists and opposition forces on monday agreed that the 
president should be a czech with no party affiliation 
in my view the president must be someone who enjoys broad 
support and guarantees stability he said seeming to describe 
havel 
on monday czechoslovaks filled the air with a jubilant 
cacophony of bells sirens and car horns in celebration of their 
popular victory over the communists 
the threeminute blast of noise replaced a scheduled general 
strike that was called off after the new 21member cabinet was 
announced sunday putting communists in the minority for the first 
time since 1948

japan will temporarily halt its driftnet fishing 
in the south pacific by 1992 if steps have not been taken by then 
to preserve marine life in the region the foreign ministry said 
today 
environmentalists and south pacific nations have criticized 
japan and taiwan for using giant drift nets in the region the nets 
sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean and critics say they kill 
virtually all fish and marine animals that swim into them 
in the south pacific we will stop at least temporarily the 
catching of albacore tuna by an agreed date with the expectation 
that when management control measures for the preservation of 
marine resources are agreed upon it will be reopened foreign 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said 
watanabe did not say when japan would halt the practice but 
another foreign ministry official said it would be by 1992 
kyodo news service said japanese and us representatives at the 
united nations had agreed on a draft resolution calling for an end 
to driftnet fishing in the regions international waters by june 
30 1992 except where protective measures have been taken 
ministry officials said the decision would not apply to the 
north pacific because measures were being taken to preserve marine 
resources in that region 
japanese officials say drift nets are the most economical means 
of harvesting fish in the open seas 
last year the number of japanese drift net boats in the south 
pacific surged from 20 to 60 and taiwans fleet included at least 
60 vessels 
following criticism from the region japan said it would reduce 
its number to 20 this season and taiwan promised to reduce its 
fleet to 24

mayor kathy whitmire attended a funeral for a 
slain policeman today despite a plea from his lawyer to stay away 
because the officer believed she was no friend of the police 
department 
whitmire and police chief lee p brown joined several hundred 
officers at the funeral for jim boswell at the invitation of 
boswells father cecil e boswell of meridian miss said the 
mayors spokesman paul mabry 
she did not immediately discuss the issue with reporters at the 
service at second baptist church 
richard cobb lawyer for the houston police patrolmens union 
had written mrs whitmire that it was boswells last wish that 
you should not be admitted to his funeral 
officer boswell felt very strongly that you neither respected 
nor supported him or his fellow officers when he was a houston 
police officer cobb wrote 
boswell 29 was shot to death saturday by a man who approached 
him for help as he wrote a traffic ticket the fouryear veteran 
had told the man he would have to wait while the officer finished 
writing the ticket 
craig neal ogan 35 is being held without bail on charges of 
capital murder he was shot by boswells partner and remains in 
fair condition under police guard at ben taub hospital 
boswell was the second houston officer slain in two days on 
sunday an offduty officer was killed in a domestic dispute 
cobbs letter purported to represent boswells entire family 
but mabry said the officers father was embarrassed by the letter 
and wanted the mayor to come 
police union president tommy britt said the letter had been 
written at the elder boswells request britt speculated that the 
officers father had later succumbed to pressure to invite the 
mayor and police chief 
boswell was a cartoonist for the sentinel a police union 
publication that has been sharply critical of the mayor and 
supported her challenger in last months election 
the very idea of your capitalizing on his death to serve your 
own public relations ends was repugnant to him and consequently 
to his family the letter said

idea to wait for a warship i was out there fishing i was not at 
war

he could at times he was firing shots from a quartermile away

the communist party today admitted 
that east germanys socialist system has failed and expressed 
support for a type of partnership with west germany 
the statement in the communist party newspaper neues deutschland 
was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the 
countrys increasingly troubled situation it came a day after 
shouting matches broke out over german reunification during 
prodemocracy protests in leipzig and dresden 
also today secretary of state james a baker iii urged caution 
on the reunification issue he visited the berlin wall and met with 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german premier hans 
modrow 
in another development the largest opposition movement new 
forum announced it will take part as a political party in the 
countrys first free elections scheduled for may 6 
neues deutschland in proposing a new party platform said 
socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our 
country and acknowledged that the popular revolutionary 
movement of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old 
system 
the paper repeated the communists promise to work for a new 
democratic socialism within a multiparty system 
during the past few weeks both germanys have increased business 
and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer 
relations since the east berlin government rejects calls for 
reunification 
neues deutschland urged a qualified partnership of both german 
states but rejected any suggestions of resolving the german 
question 
during mondays demonstrations that drew more than 200000 
protesters the largest of them the nowweekly rally in the 
southern city of leipzig speakers warned that the reunification 
issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the 
ruling communists into swift retreat 
one sign said germany united fatherland using a phrase from 
the west german national anthem 
others opposing reunification urged no fourth reich and no 
transformation of east germany into west germanys plantation 
adn said 40000 people demonstrated for reunification in 
karlmarxstadt while several thousand people split into pro and 
antireunification groups at a rally in dresden 
smaller rallies were also reported by adn in schwerin potsdam 
neubrandenburg and halle the agency did not say if reunification 
played a role in those protests 
the rallies came shortly after the four victorious world war ii 
allies met in west berlin to discuss the latest developments in 
east germany and berlin the divided city that they still 
technically administer 
the meeting brought together officials of the united states 
france and britain with soviet officials who have increasingly 
expressed concern over calls in both germanys to reunite the 
country 
kohl has advocated a confederation of the two germanys to be 
followed by eventual reunification but he stressed to reporters on 
monday that the goal of our policies is not to create an 
overpowering germany in the middle of europe the west german 
leader advocates a reunified germany that would respect the 
security needs and borders of the rest of europe 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during a central 
committee in moscow on saturday urged the west not to try to 
influence developments in east germany east germany is a front 
line of defense for the soviets who have nearly 400000 troops in 
the country 
adn said gorbachev would meet soon with gregor gysi a reformer 
who was chosen east german communist party chief on saturday 
gysis rise followed the ouster of two sets of communist 
leaders since east germans began agitating for an end to communist 
domination two months ago public pressure has forced the opening 
of the berlin wall and pushed the communists to promise free 
elections and relinquish their political monopoly

the admiral who investigated the explosion 
aboard the battleship uss iowa said today he knew of no new 
information that would change his conclusion that a depressed 
gunners mate clayton hartwig likely caused the blast that killed 
47 sailors 
but the statements by navy officials in defense of their 
findings failed to sway several members of the house armed services 
investigations subcommittee who continued to question the 
services findings in the tragedy last april 19 
i believe after these hearings we all will have a much better 
insight into this man hartwig to see if he indeed was the type of 
person who could have killed himself and 46 of his shipmates 
subcommittee chairman nicholas mavroules dmass said at the 
start of three days of hearings 
i am not now convinced he was capable of such an act 
mavroules added 
rear adm richard milligan who oversaw the inquiry into the 
explosion that rocked gun turret no 2 on the iowa told lawmakers 
he knew his conclusion would be the source of controversy and 
for many of pain and heartache 
however he said his investigation eliminated accident and 
malfunction as a cause and in his opinion the explosion was the 
result of an intentional act 
milligan said that since he released the report on sept 7 i 
know of nothing that would cause me to change my report 
members of the house panel zeroed in on the issue of the 
rotating band from the 16inch gun which according to the navy 
included some foreign material likely from a detonator navy 
officials theorized that hartwig used some type of detonator to 
trigger the explosion 
rep les aspin dwis questioned whether the band could have 
been contaminated following the explosion in the cleanup effort in 
the gun turret or in the navys handling of the evidence 
capt joseph d miceli director of the naval sea systems 
command technical investigative team said the band was not 
contaminated and the foreign material had been embedded in it 
the navys finding also came under siege in a senate committee 
monday as the ships captain refused to endorse the conclusion that 
hartwig likely caused the blast 
you know the navys on trial here in a way sen john 
warner of virginia a former navy secretary said in 
crossexamining fbi psychologists who depicted hartwig as a 
suicidal loner 
warner ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee and his panel colleagues zeroed in on three fbi 
officials who testified monday that they told the naval 
investigative service they believed hartwig displayed numerous 
symptoms of a person contemplating suicide 
the hardnosed interrogation came after iowa capt fred 
moosally in his first public testimony about the incident told 
the panel i do not agree or disagree with the navys 
conclusions 
i embraced that it was an intentional act moosally told 
reporters after his appearance i cannot make the jump that it 
was absolutely petty officer hartwig i dont think i can say 
that a definite individual did it he was a good gunners mate 
moosally however said he thought the ship had been sabotaged 
because he didnt believe there could be any other explanation for 
the april 19 explosion 
the service in its sept 7 report concluded that hartwig 
most likely caused the blast by inserting some type of 
detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch 
guns 
navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial 
because all the witnesses including hartwig were killed 
the service said the case against hartwig was built largely on 
evidence drawn from forensic tests and a psychological profile 
which was a point of contention monday for members of the senate 
panel 
using information provided by the naval investigative service 
including hartwigs letters interviews with the seamans family 
and friends and his personal history three fbi psychologists 
testified that hartwig was egocentric shy not sufficiently 
aggressive had a low selfesteem 
with members of hartwigs family sitting nearby the 
psychologists cited various bits of information that when pieced 
together according to their assessment form a picture of a loner 
bent on selfdestruction 
the fbi officials however acknowledged that they had no hard 
evidence that hartwig was responsible for the explosion 
his whole fabric is death and destruction said robert 
hazelwood of the fbis criminal investigative analysis program 
among the information on hartwig was a subscription to soldier 
of fortune magazine he had as a teenager a suicidal gesture he 
once made to a friend at age 17 or 18 his collection of knives and 
his reference to the iowa as a damning pig 
the fbi officials also said that at the time of his death 
hartwig had 34 in his bank account few clothes and a poorly 
maintained vehicle 
but members of the committee questioned how the psychologists 
could determine that based on traits fairly common among young 
sailors the 24yearold hartwig was suicidal

an egyptian airliner landed here today 
for the first time in 10 years marking an improvement in relations 
between the two arab countries at odds with each other since 
cairos peace treaty with israel 
the egypt air boeing 737 carried a special party of officials 
lead by maj gen samir rashad egypts deputy minister of 
transport 
the two countries still do not have diplomatic relations but 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and syrian president hafez assad 
decided during a telephone call monday to resume air links 
syria and libya are the only arab holdouts against 
rehabilitating egypt by restoring diplomatic relations severed to 
protest cairos 1979 peace treaty with israel the other 15 arab 
states that broke off ties for the same reason have since restored 
them 
but small steps toward full normalcy have been evident in recent 
months in egypts relations with syria and libya 
mubarak visited the libyan town of sirte today for talks with 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi the middle east news agency said it 
was their fourth meeting this year and the news agency report 
indicated economic cooperation would be a main topic 
the egyptian news agency said the air agreement with syria was 
reached in a telephone call mubarak made to president hafez assad 
of syria 
the accord takes effect today the agency said and mubarak 
ordered prompt implementation it did not say how many weekly 
flights egyptair and syrian arab airlines the national carriers 
would operate between cairo and damascus 
air services were halted immediately after the diplomatic 
rupture 
middle east news agency also reported that mubarak would be 
sending a special envoy to assad in damascus within the next few 
days government sources said the emissary was expected to be 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
resuming air services is the first normalization measure since 
mubarak and assad met privately in may during an arab summit in 
casablanca morocco 
sixteen months earlier the two leaders had talked privately on 
the sidelines of an islamic summit in kuwait that meeting in 
january 1987 was the first for the two since mubarak took office 
in 1981 
egypts relations with libya thawed faster this year than with 
syria 
mubarak and gadhafi also met in casablanca during the may 
summit then they met twice in october first in egypts 
mediterranean city of mersa matruh close to the border between the 
north african countries and the next day in libyas port of tobruk 
gadhafi and mubarak agreed to closer economic ties in 
agriculture petroleum and industry lowlevel egyptian and libyan 
delegations exchanged visits to promote cooperation including 
possible joint projects 
in june egypt and libya resumed direct air services and 
reopened frontiers closed since 1977 when the two countries fought

the national commission on aids today called 
for an end to practices that discriminate against visitors to the 
united states who are infected with the aids virus 
the commission also called for an end to the questioning of 
nonimmigrants about their aids status while applying for visas 
this would eliminate the current practice of stopping 
travelers who are carrying azt which is the only licensed antihiv 
drug and blood products such as clotting factor which is used by 
hemophiliacs the commission said hiv stands for human 
immunodeficiency virus believed to be the cause of aids 
in some cases travelers have been ejected from the united 
states because it was revealed by inference or direct questioning 
that the traveler had hiv infection the commission said 
current us visa practices have been criticized by a number of 
scientific medical and humanitarian organizations 
the commission said that when hiv testing is part of the 
immigration process the federal agencies must ensure that 
standards are enforced for counseling confidentiality and 
referrals for health care 
the national commission on aids is an independent body created 
by congress to oversee efforts against the disease and to make 
recommendations for national policy 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
incurable disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering 
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
is spread through contact with blood or with semen from infected 
persons no one is known to have recovered from the disease

a federal judge approved a 130 million 
settlement of a 7yearold school desegregation case but put the 
money in a courtsupervised account to make sure its spent on 
addressing racial discrimination 
it is now abundantly clear that the settlement funds cannot be 
trusted to the parties us district judge henry woods said 
monday 
under the settlement the state agreed to pay 130 million to 
help achieve racial balance in three school districts in pulaski 
county which includes little rock the scene in 1957 of a landmark 
federalstate showdown over segregation 
the money will be used to implement a plan to assign students 
among the districts to promote racial balance to reimburse the 
costs of raising the level of education in little rock and to pay 
other desegregation costs 
in approving the settlement woods blasted school districts for 
suggesting that the money be used to pay debts unrelated to 
desegregation and he cut the plaintiffs attorney fees sharply 
from 315 million to 850000 
woods ordered that the largest desegregation settlement in state 
history be put in an account monitored by a courtappointed 
supervisor 
the amount of money is meager enough he said to put money 
in the hands of those who feel no compunction even to say they 
intend to spend the money to compensate the victims of racial 
discrimination would be a grave injustice 
the little rock school district which is mostly black had sued 
the neighboring mostly white north little rock and pulaski county 
districts alleging that the placement of new schools had prompted 
white flight from the little rock schools the districts have a 
total enrollment of about 58000 
the settlement was reached in march in a special session in 
july the legislature agreed to spend 12975 million over 10 years 
for desegregation 
the little rockarea districts in 1982 began magnet schools 
which attract both blacks and whites by offering a specialized 
curriculum and busing to achieve racial balance began in 1972 
in 1957 thengov orval faubus refused to allow nine black 
students to enter little rocks allwhite central high school 
president eisenhower sent federal troops to keep the peace and 
enforce courtordered desegregation

the government of ethiopia has agreed to 
establish a corridor for emergency food aid into its embattled and 
droughtstricken north kenyas president said tuesday 
president daniel arap moi said he had asked ethiopias two main 
rebel groups to do the same and to stop fighting when this food 
aid is being delivered i hope they will do so 
he said the rebels had not responded to his request 
moi said he asked ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam to 
create a corridor for food aid to pass to the people of tigre and 
eritrea he has accepted that request it was not clear if moi 
was referring to people in governmentheld areas in war zones or 
in both 
the united nations says the drought in ethiopias northern 
provinces of eritrea tigre gonder and wollo threatens as many as 
4 million people with starvation and it has urged international 
donors to provide 600000 tons of emergency relief food ethiopias 
government disputes the un figure and claims the real number of 
people threatened with famine is 18 million 
about half the people threatened with famine live behind rebel 
lines relief agencies fear mass migrations of the hungry to 
governmentheld areas in search of food 
such migrations in the 198485 famine led to vast overcrowded 
and unsanitary camps where as many people died from disease as from 
hunger as many as 1 million people are believed to have died in 
that disaster 
an ethiopian government spokesman attending preliminary peace 
talks that opened tuesday in rome between ethiopias government and 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation army confirmed that a corridor 
would be opened and said a date for the start of relief shipments 
along the route would be decided this week 
the spokesman who declined to give his name would not give any 
details on the proposed route 
however a rebel spokesman also at the talks said he did not 
think any such relief corridor would be opened soon 
we are pushing for corridors between the rebelcontrolled 
areas as well as between the governmentcontrolled areas at least 
for free passage of relief and relief workers but so far to no 
avail said the spokesman who identified himself only as hayla 
neither spokesman would say whether moi intervened in attempts 
to establish the corridor 
the idea of relief corridors into embattled areas was 
implemented in southern sudan this year when the united nations 
launched a massive aid program aimed at averting tens of thousands 
of famine deaths 
sudans government and the nations southern rebels respected 
the half a dozen corridors or routes established for the delivery 
of relief supplies into southern sudan for about six months before 
the de facto ceasefire dissolved in renewed fighting 
mois announcement came on the opening day of a second round of 
preliminary peace talks in rome between ethiopias government and 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front aimed at ending their 
14yearold civil war 
the tigreans in a 3monthold offensive have pushed to within 
100 miles of ethiopias capital addis ababa and are seen as a 
growing threat to mengistus government 
ethiopias other major rebel group the eritrean peoples 
liberation front which has been fighting a secessionist battle in 
northern eritrea province since 1961 ended its second round of 
preliminary peace talks with the government nov 29 both sides 
have agreed to begin substantial negotiations next year

a late surge of support for 
leftist candidate luis inacio lula da silva has made the former 
lathe operator a strong contender to become brazils next president 
in sundays runoff election 
da silva who trailed conservative fernando collor de mello by 
10 to 15 points in public opinion polls a week ago narrowed the 
gap to 3 points in a survey released monday by the datafolha 
polling organization 
the winner will be brazils first freely elected president in 29 
years the incumbent jose sarney was picked by an electoral 
college strongly influenced by the military regime that ran the 
country between 1964 and 1985 
the prospect of a leftist victory was credited with causing a 30 
percent jump in dollar prices on the black market monday 
a cartoon in the newspaper folha de sao paulo tuesday showed a 
dollar bill chasing da silva up a flight of stairs saying you 
want to stop climbing because im tired 
many analysts predict da silva popularly known as lula will 
overtake collor de mello 
lula is the clear favorite only a huge mistake on his part 
can save collor de mello said political commentator ricardo 
noblat of the rio daily newspaper jornal do brasil 
just weeks ago a victory for da silva seemed all but impossible 
in balloting nov 15 collor de mello won 28 percent of the vote 
while da silva finished second with 16 percent since no candidate 
received a majority sundays runoff was scheduled 
polls show support is growing nationwide for da silva who has 
attracted huge crowds collor de mello meanwhile has canceled 
three days of campaign activities to revamp his tv spots 
some say the turning point in the campaign was a dec 3 
televised debate which polls show da silva won 
lula has a message that is far more popular than collor de 
mellos said alexandre barros director of early warning a 
political consulting firm 
da silva of the marxistoriented workers party preaches 
sweeping agrarian reform a massive redistribution of wealth and an 
immediate suspension of interest payments on brazils 110 billion 
foreign debt the largest in the third world 
collor de mello of the conservative national reconstruction 
party has campaigned on a platform of cleaning up and reducing 
brazils corrupt state bureaucracy 
analysts say da silva has greater credibility as a proponent of 
social change in a country where most workers earn less than 100 
per month 
a gradeschool dropout da silva worked as a delivery boy and 
messenger before landing a job as a metalworker as union 
president he was jailed by the military government after leading a 
huge strike in 1980 against foreignowned automobile companies 
in 1986 he was elected to congress with more votes than any 
other candidate 
collor de mello born into one of the countrys most powerful 
families entered politics in 1979 when military leaders appointed 
him mayor of maceio the capital of northeastern alagoas state he 
later was elected federal representative and governor 
the workers party has shown that collor de mello hired thousands 
of public employees including family members during his tenure as 
mayor he also was accused of favoring the states wealthy sugar 
barons 
as governor collor de mello did fire some local civil servants 
earning thousands of dollars a month much more than the average 
worker and he gained national headlines for weeding out the 
socalled maharajas 
other parties and politicians show concern for the plight of 
the poor but it is not perceived as real only the workers party 
can legitimately say it is from the people said francisco 
weffort a political scientist at the university of sao paulo and 
supporter of da silva 
da silva has the support of labor groups intellectuals and the 
progressive wing of brazils powerful roman catholic church 
his wellorganized party has more than 1 million campaign 
workers across the country and won endorsements from leftist 
opponents leonel brizola and mario covas who finished third and 
fourth in the nov 15 balloting 
collor de mellos most prominent supporters are big businessmen 
rural landowners and conservative politicians 
collor de mello cant present his allies because they cost him 
votes theyre all identified with a system everyone wants to 
change political commentator noblat said

about 20000 people joined a candlelight 
rally tonight urging rapid democratic reforms while communist 
leaders discussed demands for free elections and the elimination of 
their monopoly on power 
the crowd gathered outside the communist party central 
committees building downtown some people put their candles on 
building ledges but a guard later scornfully blew out candles and 
threw them away 
this is the best place to put the candles because its right 
under their noses meaning the party leaders inside said two 
young men who spoke on condition of anonymity 
when asked if they thought the central committee would notice 
the candles one said they dont have any other choice we are 
the reform 
party chief petar mladenov told the central committee monday 
that dialogue should begin immediately between the communists and 
all political forces without exceptions he also said the party 
was prepared to relinquish its constitutionally guaranteed leading 
role 
in a twohour speech mladenov said he favored a socialist 
market economy implying some easing of state ownership 
the policymaking central committee met today to consider the 
proposals the latest in a series of democratic reforms since 
hardline leader todor zhivkov was ousted nov 10 a day after the 
berlin wall effectively came down 
the meeting comes as popular pressure for reform is mounting 
with thousands taking to the streets in the last two days to demand 
bulgaria follow the reform movements sweeping nearly all the rest 
of eastern europe 
in other developments in the region 
the soviet congress convening in moscow today rejected a 
debate on whether to scrap the communist partys leading role in 
society 
more than 150000 people rallied for democracy in the east 
german city of leipzig with shouting matches erupting for a fourth 
straight week over whether germany should reunite other rallies 
monday took place in karlmarxstadt dresden neubrandenburg 
halle and potsdam 
yugoslavias political crisis deepened as communist leaders in 
the countrys secondlargest state croatia joined colleagues in 
slovenia in defying populous serbia and demanding a multiparty 
system 
as the central committee met in sofia on monday more than 
10000 people gathered outside party headquarters in a silent 
candlelight vigil to underline their demands for change 
since mladenov took over as communist chief he has ousted 
several of zhivkovs supporters from the ruling politburo 
one cannot postulate the role of party in a democratic society 
or define it on command he told the central committee this 
role can only be won as a result of the peoples trust 
evgeni aleksandrov a party spokesman said the provision 
guaranteeing communist supremacy is to be abolished in a new 
constitution next year and free and democratic elections should be 
scheduled by may 
in making such promises mladenov appeared to meet the major 
demands of more than 50000 people who rallied in sofia on sunday 
this year communists first in poland and hungary and more recently 
east germany and czechoslovakia have given up their guaranteed 
leading role in society 
aleksandrov told reporters that dialogue could begin with 
opponents immediately and said such talks could be very useful in 
preparing the elections 
mladenov who only became party leader one month ago also 
proposed that party leaders be limited to just two terms in office 
or eight years total he proposed that the term of the current 
leadership end at the next party congress which he said should be 
moved up from late 1990 to march 
since zhivkovs downfall after 35 years in power the official 
media have become more open people have been able to demonstrate 
without police interference for the first time in more than 40 
years and independent groups have been allowed to function 
at mondays evening vigil a woman caught up in an emotional 
debate said bulgarians were willing to stand there around the clock 
until the leadership acted on reform 
aleksandrov said mladenov proposed that parliament in january 
address the most urgent economic problems in the country of 89 
million people and discuss a concrete stabilization program 
mladenov did not go into detail but indicated he was for mixed 
ownership when he called for a socialist market economy 
he quoted mladenov as saying the socialist system in bulgaria 
had degenerated into a regime of personal power namely 
zhivkov 
with the changes now promised in bulgaria romania under 
hardline leader nicolae ceausescu remains the only warsaw pact 
ally resistent to reform

fda commissioner frank young leaving after 
the worst scandal in the agencys history said in a farewell 
speech tuesday that it is time for a new beginning at the fda 
to fully get through this though fda needs a little 
breathing room some space as my son might say to reassess its 
priorities and to develop a strategy for the next decade young 
told the food and drug law institutes annual education conference 
he did not speak of his reason for leaving the job after 5 
years but said the acceptance of illegal gratuities by three 
former fda employees has shamed and angered all 7500 of us in 
the agency 
sources inside and outside government have said they believe 
young was forced out because of the generic drug scandal that 
uncovered fraud corruption and mismanagement within the agency 
dr louis w sullivan secretary of health and human services 
told the group that he would not tolerate bribery fraud or other 
illegalities or improprieties and said he is directing 
establishment of an advisory committee on the food and drug 
administration 
this advisory committee will explore current concerns about 
the fda and develop policy or structural recommendations to address 
any problems they uncover he said giving the panel a year to 
make its report 
young will become deputy assistant secretary for health science 
and environment youngs old and new jobs are in the public health 
service which is part of hhs 
his farewell speech reflected some bitterness with recent events 
and the treatment generally of fda whose mission is to regulate 
quality testing and approval of the nations food and 
pharmaceuticals 
young said fda employees deserve more respect 
weve had enough too much of politicians who view civil 
servants as part of the problem he said adding that the agency 
needs competitive salaries and better facilities 
i am truly ashamed of the inadequate poor facilities that we 
occupy in 23 buildings located at seven sites around the city and 
suburbs of washington young said 
he called the bribery scandal an aberration in a long 
tradition of excellent service to the nation and offered this 
advice 
to special interest groups and their representatives youve 
got to stop approaching fda as if your special interest your 
single interest were the only issue we face you must begin to 
understand that not all public health issues are created equal 
that your particular hobby horse may not be the fdas no 1 public 
health or regulatory problem nor should it be 
to congress one concern i would raise is the tendency for 
congress to act more like a cluster of individuals than a 
legislative body its as if the beautiful forest that we once knew 
had been replaced by a group of individual trees 
the agency deserves the guarantee of no new responsibilities 
without concomitant resources and while fda is most willing to 
accept constructive criticism from the congress such criticism 
should be factually based and consistent with a reasonable 
assessment of agency priorities the agency should respectfully 
ask members of congress to resist the temptation to grandstand on 
fda issues 
to lawyers when you approach the agency carry your own 
credibility as well as your clients if your clients case is a 
strong one by all means argue strongly but if your clients case 
is a weak one dont oversell 
to the president the fda is somewhat like a referee in a 
football game while most people cheer loudly for the home team 
and a few even cheer for the visiting team nobody ever cheers for 
the referee and yet like the referee fda often has to make the 
difficult calls and without the benefit of an instant replay

third world nations could save 76 million 
of their own children from death by disease every year by shifting 
a small part of their military expenditures to health care unicef 
said tuesday 
developing countries spend a total of 145 billion a year on 
their military establishments james p grant executive director 
of unicef the un childrens fund said in his annual report 
he said nearly 8000 children die each day in the third world 
because they are not immunized almost 7000 a day die of 
dehydration caused by diarrhea and about 6000 of pneumonia for a 
total of 76 million 
the cost of immunizing all children and providing medicines for 
dehydration and pneumonia would be about 25 billion a year grant 
said in his report the state of the worlds children 1990 
it is a great deal of money grant said it is as much as 
the soviet union has been spending on vodka it is as much as us 
companies have been spending on advertising cigarettes it is as 
much as 10 percent of the eecs annual subsidy to its farmers it 
is as much as 2 percent of the developing worlds military 
spending 
in the report grant said third world countries spend almost 
1 billion every day for the military and interest on foreign 
debt two essentially unproductive activities 
at a news conference tuesday in washington he said it is in 
the power of industrial countries to significantly reduce the debt 
burden which is taking such a tremendous toll 
because of such unproductive drains on resources he wrote in 
the report education spending per pupil has dropped by 25 percent 
in the 37 poorest countries in the past decade and health spending 
has fallen in most of africa and latin america 
if trends continue the report said more than 100 million 
children will die needlessly in the next decade 
they will die in the sunkeneyed coma of dehydration or in 
the gasping extremities of pneumonia or in the iron grip of 
tetanus or in the fever of measles or on the rack of whooping 
cough grant said 
those illnesses all treatable or preventable with inexpensive 
vaccines antibiotics or oral rehydration therapy account for over 
half of the 14 million annual child deaths in the world and most of 
the malnutrition according to unicef 
to mobilize the political will to solve those problems in the 
1990s unicef wants a world summit for children to be held in 
september at un headquarters in new york grant said more than 
100 countries had endorsed a summit which would be the first 
gathering of world leaders for the specific purpose of addressing a 
major social issue 
it is time that the needs of children were given this kind of 
priority he said 
protecting the physical and mental development of children is 
the most important of all investments in the social and economic 
development of our societies doing what can now be done to achieve 
that goal is therefore an issue worthy of its place on the agenda 
of the worlds political leaders 
about 15 billion children will be born in the 1990s the 
largest new generation in history un population figures indicate 
the birth rate will begin to decline in the next century 
grants report gave examples of remarkable progress in solving 
health problems that is possible in a short time if there is a 
collective will 
ten years ago fewer than 10 percent of the children in the 
third world were immunized now almost 70 percent receive 
immunization which saves about 2 million lives a year 
oral rehydration therapy for diarrheal disease victims is used 
by one of three families in the developing world and saves about 1 
million children a year in the early 1980s the technique was 
almost unknown outside scientific cicles 
the spread of polio immunization in the last decade has meant 
about 15 million children are walking running and playing today 
who otherwise would have been crippled

israel on tuesday unveiled a fullscale 
prototype of its first communications satellite scheduled to be 
launched in 1993 and officials said they expected it to boost

applications he said 
israel plans to launch two amos communications satellites in 
1993 and will offer to sell it to foreign countries or 
corporations the launch will be carried out by the european 
arianne space consortium 
the satellite is designed for developing countries and very 
large corporations that need a dedicated satellite for their own 
purposes herman said

congress first order of business when it 
reconvenes next month will be an attempt to override president 
bushs veto of a bill permitting chinese students to remain in the 
united states indefinitely if they fear retaliation at home the 
bills sponsor said today 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif said she has received assurances of 
the top priority from house and senate leaders that an override 
vote would be the first order of business when congress returns to 
session in late january 
congressional democrats fuming over renewed highlevel us 
visits with chinas leaders also are vowing to revive legislation 
imposing sanctions on the chinese government as punishment for the 
killings of prodemocracy demonstrators 
pelosi at a news conference said she is gaining commitments to 
override now from democrats and republicans and is confident of a 
large bipartisan majority 
i think we have enough votes to override she said we 
feel the presidents actions this weekend are such a slap in the 
face to the forces of democracy and such an encouragement of a 
tyranical regime that it is making our job easier 
haiching zhao chairman of the national committee on chinese 
student affairs said the administrations highlevel visit to 
china will strengthen the hardliners in beijing and encourage a 
slide into darkness in china 
the situation in china has not been improved since the june 
4th massacre he said taken together the veto and the visit 
create a clear and present danger that the hardliners in the 
chinese government will now feel free to impose more repression and 
further reprisals against the democracy movement 
congress is in no mood to kowtow to these chinese leaders 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the foreign affairs 
asian subcommittee said monday as he predicted congress will 
override the bush veto and adopt the legislation requiring 
sanctions 
but congress is out of session and a legislative attack on 
bushs china policy must wait until the second session of the 101st 
congress convenes late next month 
republican sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky joined democrats in 
the criticism 
i think its the wrong message at the wrong time although i 
know what the president was trying to do mcconnell said this 
morning on nbcs today show we have historically when we 
have made overtures to the soviet union or had big meetings with 
the soviet union felt the need to have some gesture in the 
direction of the chinese 
bush gained support for his overature to china however from 
rep jim leach riowa in a statement he called the criticism 
premature and said the trip was a risky but thoughtful 
consultation that could lead to moderation by china 
democratic leaders made clear their strong disagreement with 
bushs decision to dispatch brent scowcroft his national security 
adviser and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to 
beijing over the weekend for the first highlevel meetings with 
chinas leaders since the crackdown in tiananmen square in june 
i condemn the presidents veto of the chinese students bill 
and this weekends embarrassing kowtowing to the chinese 
government said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
these actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for 
human rights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals 
mitchell said he will lead the fight to override the bushs nov 
30 veto of legislation which would permit chinese students to 
remain in the united states if they fear reprisal at home 
we will make every effort to override that veto mitchell 
said 
although the house and senate approved differing versions of 
sanctions legislation they failed to complete action on a single 
measure before congress adjourned for the year on nov 21 
both bills would incorporate into law the steps bush took 
voluntarily after the chinese crackdown 
although the legislation would permit the president to suspend 
sanctions if he certified that doing so was in the national 
interest it likely would be politically difficult without 
significant human rights improvement in china 
the sanctions include 
suspending insurance and financing for us investment in china 
by the overseas private investment corp 
barring export to china of all weapons and military equipment 
or equipment intended for police use 
prohibiting export of nuclear supplies equipment and 
technology

the labor department proposed 33 million in 
fines tuesday against a philadelphia plant for 840 alleged safety 
violations including failure to tell some workers that tests 
showed their hearing was deteriorating 
most of the citations issued to the budd co by the departments 
occupational safety and health administration alleged violations 
either of noise and hearingrelated standards or requirements that 
employers keep detailed records of workplace injuries 
of the 840 citations 834 were for alleged willful violations of 
safety standards meaning that osha believes the company knew of 
violations or hazardous conditions but made no meaningful effort to 
correct them 
nearly 500 of the alleged willful violations dealt with 
noiserelated standards including 124 instances in which osha said 
companyadministered tests showed employees hearing had 
deteriorated but the company did not inform the workers 
budd which makes doors lift gates and other sheetmetal 
products for automobiles has 15 working days to contest the 
citations and fine the fifth largest proposed by osha 
the company said in a statement that it was committed to worker 
safety had hired a consultant to assess noise exposure and had 
revised its medical recordkeeping 
however the company said it could not reply in detail to the 
citations because its officials had not had time to review them 
the plant like osha is deeply concerned about any situation 
which may pose a threat to the safety of its employees and the 
company will do everything appropriate to ensure that its employees 
continue to work in the safest environment possible the company 
said from its troy mich corporate office 
budd said about 2400 people work at the philadelphia plant 
which was inspected by osha beginning in june after an employee 
complaint 
hearing loss is one of the most debilitating hazards found in 
this type of workplace and systematic deficiencies in virtually 
all aspects of this companys hearing conservation program to 
protect workers against such loss were identified labor 
secretary elizabeth dole said in a statement 
assistant labor secretary gerard f scannell who heads osha 
said tests indicated that noise levels in an area where 150 press 
operators work were above government limits 
citations against the company included allegations of failure to 
administer annual audiogram tests failure to compare annual 
hearing test results with baseline hearing levels or failure to 
have physicians review problem cases willful violations of 
recordkeeping regulations and inadequate noise monitoring 
the largest fine proposed by osha was 73 million levied 
earlier this year against usx corp for alleged safety violations 
that case is pending

the bush administration in another possible 
concession to beijing said today it may lift a ban on the export 
of three communications satellites that would be launched by china 
no decision has been made but it is possible white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
if granted the waiver would be a further softening of us 
sanctions imposed against china after the june massacre of hundreds 
of prodemocracy advocates 
the white house confirmed on monday that chinese engineers have 
been allowed to return to work in the united states on a 500 
million program to upgrade chinese f8 fighter planes with 
sophisticated electronics equipment 
the bush administration also has renewed us subsidies for 
grain sales to beijing 
on dec 5 the agriculture department announced that china would 
be eligible to buy an additional one million metric tons of wheat 
using export enhancement program subsidies 
the announcement came as the chinese had used up almost all of 
their previous eep allocation a twomillionton promise that had 
been made when president bush visited china last february nearly 
half the sales under that allocation have been made since the 
tiananmen square massacre with a subsidy value of more than 11 
million 
explaining the pending decision on the satellites fitzwater 
said bushs freeze on sales of military weapons and defense 
articles was not intended to disrupt normal commercial relations 
referring to the satellites fitzwater said we recognize that 
some items captured in the suspension here have civilian 
applications and fall in the category of normal commercial 
exports 
two of the satellites are being built by the hughes aircraft co 
in a joint project with australia the third satellite is being 
refurbished by hughes for asiasat a britishchinese consortium 
fitzwater said he was not aware of any softening in the us 
opposition to granting world bank loans to china 
bush said chinas record of human rights abuses are not a 
barrier to better relations with the united states 
we have contacts with countries that have egregious records on 
human rights bush said monday explaining his decision to send a 
highlevel delegation to beijing seeking new impetus and vigor 
in sinous relations 
he pledged to keep looking for ways to find common ground 
generally speaking i realize the difficulty of this 
relationship but i dont want to make it any worse bush said 
id like to think it would improve 
he said however his initiative had not produced total 
normalization of relations and that an array of sanctions remain 
in place 
meanwhile the sponsor of legislation permitting chinese 
students to remain in the united states if they fear retaliation at 
home said congress will attempt to override bushs veto as soon as 
it reconvenes next month 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif said she has received assurances 
the veto override attempt will receive top priority from house and 
senate leaders 
i think we have enough votes to override she told a news 
conference saying she is receiving commitments from both democrats 
and republicans 
senate majority leader george mitchell condemned the us 
overture to beijing as embarrassing kowtowing to the chinese 
government 
mitchell dmaine said the administration supports human 
rights in its words it does not do so in its deeds these 
actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human 
rights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals 
bush defended his action during a meeting with newspaper 
editorial page editors 
elsewhere on the foreign policy front the president said he 
would do nothing to force the issue of german reunification 
its too sensitive and its not the role for the united states 
to do that bush said suggesting the day has long passed when 
either the us president or the soviet leader had a role on the 
issue of european boundaries 
he underscored his hope that a drug summit can be held next 
february in colombia despite recent violence there saying he 
wanted no part of sending a signal that colombian president 
virgilio barco cannot provide the proper security 
bush also said the united states does not favor any step that 
would force israel to be pressured into negotiating with the 
palestine liberation organization despite secretary of state james 
a baker iiis efforts to help formulate a way to get middle east 
peace talks going 
bush met with the editors after receiving a briefing from brent 
scowcroft his national security adviser who returned monday from 
a weekend visit to beijing he was accompanied on the trip by 
lawrence eagleburger the deputy secretary of state 
the trip represented an aboutface in us demands that china 
take the first step to repair the breach in relations for its 
part china had bitterly rejected the us criticism and a series 
of american sanctions as amounting to interference in its internal 
affairs

keeping alive the landmark brown vs board of 
education case a federal appeals court has ruled that topeka 
kan has not done enough to end school segregation a court 
official said today 
the decision monday by the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
reversed a judges ruling in topekas favor 
only participants in the case got copies the ruling was 
expected to be released to the general public later today 
but patrick fisher deputy chief clerk of the appeals court 
said the court ruled some elements of segregation still exist in 
the topeka school system and it sent the case back to federal 
court in kansas to come up with a remedy 
the appeals court recognized that topeka has made progress in 
recent years but said that the school system is engaged in benign 
neglect and is not meeting the courts requirements fisher said 
the ruling could jeopardize federal funds coming into the 
district 
the appeals court had issued a similar ruling in the case june 2 
but withdrew the decison the following month without explanation 
both sides in the case said monday they would study the ruling 
before announcing their next move 
the original lawsuit challenged a kansas law authorizing school 
segregation the 1954 supreme court decision striking down the law 
paved the way for nationwide school desegregation 
in 1979 however the case was revived by black parents who 
claimed topeka had failed to segregate its schools the plaintiffs 
included linda brown buckner who was a youngster when her name 
went on the original lawsuit 25 years ago 
us district judge richard rogers ruled in 1987 that remaining 
racial imbalances in topekas schools were the result of housing 
patterns not school board action

a pair of dog tags that lay forgotten 
in an english forest for 45 years have been returned to their 
original owner with the help of a british treasure hunter 
it was amazing it was something i never anticipated said 
john kawa who lost the identification chain while he was an 
american corporal training in britain for dday 
you never know what youre going to come across in life 
kawa said monday 
the tags were lost in the spring of 1944 in a wiltshire forest 
kawa said he took them off because the swinging chain got in his 
way while he tried to wash in a helmet full of water and he then 
forgot them in the rush of exercises 
last summer a letter arrived at the old family house in 
springfield where kawas sister anna now lives 
i opened the letter and i said i know what it is said 
kawa who knew by the heading of the letter which copied the style 
of the dog tags that listed his mothers name and his name 
i knew right then and there it was the dog tags kawa said 
the letter was from keith r genever of wiltshire who said he 
found the chain and tags while pursuing his hobby of treasure 
hunting with a metal detector 
the two men corresponded and kawa now 66 got the tags back

ending a testy summit five central 
american presidents today called for the demobilization of el 
salvadors leftist guerrillas along with the usbacked nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
this is a blow against those who want war president daniel 
ortega of nicaragua said 
the presidents said the united nations should play a key role 
arranging more direct us and soviet roles in regional peace 
efforts and overseeing the demobilization of the salvadoran and 
contra rebels 
in a communique issued at the end of the twoday gathering the 
presidents urged the salvadoran insurgents to cease all operations 
that endanger civilians and to join the peaceful political process 
the agreement expressed support for el salvadors rightist 
government as a government born out of a democratic and 
pluralistic process 
it condemned armed activities and terrorism by irregular 
forces in the region and said the leftist guerrillas should 
resume talks with the government 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration had not yet analyzed all of the parts of the 
communique but that generally we have concerns about it 
were certainly skeptical we remain to be convinced he 
said citing evidence that nicaragua is unwilling to live up to its 
commitments about democratic reforms 
fitzwater said the fact that nicaragua agreed not to support the 
marxist rebels in el salvador was encouraging 
the statement was the leaders strongest call for an end to the 
bitter civil war that has flared with renewed vigor in el salvador 
in recent weeks 
the presidents of costa rica guatemala and honduras urged el 
salvador and nicaragua to mend their tattered relations 
el salvador suspended relations with nicaragua on nov 26 after 
a nicaraguanregistered plane loaded with antiaircraft missiles 
that was allegedly destined for the salvadoran rebels crashed 
the accord was reached after a fourhour delay caused when 
president jose azcona hoyo of honduras stormed out of the summit 
then agreed to return after settling a dispute with nicaragua 
azcona had been angered by nicaraguas refusal to drop its case 
in the world court that accuses honduras of harboring usbacked 
contra rebels azcona returned after nicaragua said it would 
suspend the case for six months the suspension was included in the 
final communique 
the communique also said the presidents would meet in the first 
part of 1990 in managua the nicaraguan capital 
there has never been a summit like this such a climate of 
confrontation said costa rican information minister jorge 
urbana 
the fourhour breakdown in the talks illustrates the fragility 
of the peace process and the deep divisions among the central 
american leaders 
sources close to the talks had said the most the five presidents 
had hoped for was an agreement that kept the peace process alive 
not one that actually solved any of the regions conflicts 
in a message to costa rican president oscar arias on monday 
pope john paul ii expressed his hopes for peace but noted the 
summit came during a time of new tensions and painful conflicts 
in central america 
arias azcona and presidents daniel ortega of nicaragua alfredo 
cristiani of el salvador and vinicio cerezo of guatemala attended 
the summit neither the contras nor the salvadoran rebels were 
represented 
the presidents agreed in august to disband the contras by dec 5 
in exchange for democratization and a feb 25 election in 
nicaragua but the contras most of whom are camped in hondoras 
defied the agreement 
momentum toward peace has slowed since october with fighting 
renewed in both el salvador and nicaragua the suspension of 
diplomatic ties between the two countries and increasing campaign 
violence in nicaragua 
nicaragua is demanding the contras be demobilized by honduras or 
through a reinforced un force honduras says it wants to disband 
the force but wont use its army or shed honduran blood to do it 
a un observer group has been sent to verify the peaceful 
repatriation of the contras to nicaragua and make sure no weapons 
are sent from one country to another to help insurgent groups 
the contras say no guarantees of democracy or freedom exist for 
them inside nicaragua and their presence is the only guarantee the 
feb 25 vote will be fair

buddhists on tuesday unveiled a stuffed 
version of raja a sacred elephant whose death in 1988 plunged sri 
lanka into mourning 
the grand old elephant who after 4000 worth of taxidermy work 
looked more robust than in his last years of life stood 
majestically inside the budhhist temple with two strings of white 
flowers hanging from his tusks 
hundreds of devotees mingled with saffronrobed monks for the 
unveiling by prime minister dingiri banda wijetunga 
raja whose name means king in the sinhalese language was 
declared a national treasure by former president junius r 
jayewardene 
for 50 years before dying at age 82 raja was the center of 
attention in kandys buddhist annual pageant which runs for two 
weeks in late july and early august 
the pageant which started in 1775 transforms the central hill 
town into a maelstrom of color light and human confusion 
intermingled with the solemnity of ancient religious rituals 
the focus of the pageant is a tooth revered by believers as a 
physical relic of the lord buddha according to legend the tooth 
was smuggled into sri lanka in the 4th century ad for safekeeping 
during the siege of dantapura capital of the ancient indian 
kingdom of kalinga 
the relic often called sri lankas most prized posession is 
kept in the temple of the tooth in kandy 55 miles northeast of 
colombo 
once a year during the pageant it is placed in a golden casket 
and paraded around the town on the back of the temples premier 
pachyderm his tusks sheathed in gold and jewels white cloth is 
spread on the streets of kandy and the procession includes two 
lesser elephants each carrying an attendant to throw sweetscented 
jasmine flowers over the precious casket 
rajas successor is an elephant named indiraja the king from 
india a present from the government of india where the 
buddhist faith began 
barely 24 hours after raja died his skin was removed and 
preserved coconut fiber plaster of paris cardboard and glue were 
used to recreate his original size and shape said thelma 
gunawardana director of the department of national museums 
it was a gigantic task mrs gunawardana said it took 
four months for a fivemember team to taxidermize the 9foot tall 
11foot long elephant 
in the room with raja were photographs from his heyday and a 
replica of the golden casket 
raja will remain on display in a building next to the temple of 
the tooth 
if we continue to take care of the elephant we could preserve 
it for a century or even more mrs gunawardana said

secretary of state james a baker 
iii met today with east germanys reformist premier becoming the 
highestranking us official to visit the communist nation in 
nearly two decades 
earlier baker celebrated the opening of the berlin wall and 
outlined a new architecture for a changing europe with a 
larger role for nato and closer us ties to the western military 
alliance 
baker and east german premier hans modrow met for an hour in the 
sans souci room of the potsdam hotel 
i felt that it was important that we have an opportunity to 
let the premier and the people of east germany know of our support 
for the reforms which are taking place in this country baker 
said later 
we also wanted to make it very clear that we support the 
process of reform in a peaceful manner and that we are very anxious 
to see this process move forward in a stable way he said 
modrow 61 said east germany saw bakers visit without a 
doubt as support for reform 
this visit is a political sign that the us follows the 
developments in the ddr east germany with attention modrow 
said we started a dialogue with each other today 
modrow was named premier nov 13 of an east germany in the midst 
of a stunning upheaval that is sweeping aside orthodox communism 
it was in potsdam southwest of the divided city of berlin that 
the united states the soviet union and britain met in 1945 for a 
conference to determine germanys future after the nazi defeat in 
world war ii 
baker became the first us secretary of state to visit east 
germany since diplomatic relations were established in 1974 two 
secretaries of state john foster dulles in the 1950s and william 
p rogers in the early 1970s went to east berlin 
before driving over the glienicke bridge from west berlin to 
potsdam baker visited potsdamer platz where a new crossing point 
in the berlin wall was opened last month 
its pretty impressive he said as he toured the site with 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher on a cold 
lateautumn day 
demonstrators nearby protested against us policies in central 
america shouting yankees out of el salvador 
it was not immediately clear how the baker visit would strike 
moscow which has become increasingly wary of any signs of possible 
german reunification and of western influence on the events in east 
germany 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who met with baker earlier 
and genscher have both sought to reassure the soviets that a 
reunified germany would not pose a security threat to any other 
european state 
but soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze last week 
sharply warned genscher that reunification could only bring trouble 
shevardnadze recalled the suffering of the soviets in the german 
invasion in world war ii and told genscher that propaganda about 
a federation of two germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the 
current circumstances 
the soviets denounced kohls recent 10point plan for eventual 
reunification as fraught with dangerous consequences and 
bordering on outright diktat 
us house majority leader richard gephardt dmo and rep tom 
lantos dcalif also arranged to see modrow later in the day 
in a policy speech to the berlin press club baker said the 
united states and canada share europes neighborhood and intend 
to work with west europeans to peacefully integrate a reunified 
germany into a europe in which eastwest tensions are subsiding 
baker has been pushing for a goslow approach to german 
reunification saying the future of the two germanys should not be 
determined exclusively by the german people 
baker suggested nato oversee reductions of troops and armaments 
in a treaty being negotiated with the sovietled warsaw pact and 
take new steps to build economic and political ties with the east 
as europe changes the instruments for western cooperation 
must adapt baker said in the prepared speech working 
together we must design and gradually put into place an 
architecture for a new era 
the speech was designed to reassure nervous western allies as 
german reunification moves closer to reality 
baker discussed the situation with kohl at breakfast 
in the speech baker said reunification must be peaceful it 
must be democratic it must respect the legitimate concerns of all 
the participants in the new europe 
a senior us official told reporters the soviet unions rights 
particularly in administering berlin as part of an arrangement 
among the four world war ii allies also must be respected 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said baker 
was offering no prescription for similar changes in the warsaw 
pact but gorbachev has also been talking about a new europe as the 
old communist institutions in the east fall away 
baker urged the 15 us allies in the north atlantic treaty 
organization to establish a staff to verify arms control agreements 
and to monitor compliance with a treaty bush and gorbachev hope 
will be completed next year the superpower leaders are expected to 
set ceilings of 275000 us and soviet troops in europe and make 
sharp reductions in tanks artillery and other nonnuclear forces 
also he said as the eastwest confrontation recedes nato 
should take on a new mission of helping to resolve regional 
conflicts and to stem the proliferation of missiles chemical and 
biological weapons 
baker said the western alliance also stands as a model to 
nations of the east over four decades he said it has offered a 
vision of cooperation not coercion of open borders not iron 
curtains

former white house aide oliver l north told a 
court today he is having difficulty separating his own experiences 
in the irancontra scandal from the testimony that exnational 
security adviser john poindexter gave congress under immunity from 
prosecution 
at a pretrial hearing in the criminal case against poindexter 
north said poindexters fiveday appearance on capitol hill in july 
1987 constituted some of the most powerful testimony of the 
congressional hearings into the scandal and that he watched it 
closely 
i read the transcript of poindexters testimony said north 
who irancontra prosecutors want to use as a government witness in 
poindexters trial 
under a 1972 supreme court ruling the government may make no 
use of a defendants testimony that was compelled under a limited 
grant of immunity from prosecution that includes testimony given 
by other witnesses who may have been influenced by the immunized 
statements 
todays hearing was called so that us district judge harold 
greene can determine whether north was tainted by poindexters 
testimony 
the former national security council aide returning to the 
courthouse where he was convicted of three felonies initially 
invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination when 
called to the witness stand 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh then obtained 
from greene an order compelling north to testify in exchange for a 
promise not to prosecute him for his statements as long as he 
tells the truth 
north said he was unable to recall crucial details that 
prosecutors want to focus on in their case against poindexter 
he said he was unable to remember telling poindexter about false 
statements in letters to congress denying that north was assisting 
the contra rebels in nicaragua when such aid was banned by law 
did you have discussions with admiral poindexter before the 
letter was sent about the false nature of the response asked 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb 
i dont recall north replied 
poindexter faces trial jan 22 on criminal charges of conspiracy 
and two counts each of obstructing congress and making false 
statements in connection with irancontra 
poindexter told congress that he made no effort to prevent north 
from destroying a notebook containing information about a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexter also testified that he withheld information from 
congress on national security council activities to aid the contras 
in order to avoid publicity and more restrictive legislation in 
1985 and 1986 congress banned military aid to the rebel force by 
us intelligence agencies 
the former national security adviser is accused of falsely 
telling congress that no one in the us government knew until 1986 
that the 1985 shipment to iran contained hawks he also is accused 
of falsely denying to congress that north and the nsc staff didnt 
solicit funds or offer tactical advice to the contras 
north was convicted may 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress accepting an illegal gratuity and of destroying 
government documents 
he was sentenced july 5 to 1200 hours of community service and 
a 150000 fine north is appealing the convictions and the fine 
while serving the community service in an antidrug program 
on monday independent counsel lawrence walsh disclosed that 
president bush had turned aside walshs request for a facetoface 
meeting with the president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that the 
decision against a meeting with walsh was the recommendation of 
counsel white house counsel boyden gray which the president 
accepted and agrees with we should not be involved in the legal 
process and the court system 
fitzwater said the cases themselves and legal ramifications 
are subjects that should be discussed between the attorney 
general who is the presidents lawyer and the independent 
counsel 
on substance our responsiblity is to protect classified 
information an to protect methods and sources and so forth that are 
part ofthat and we feel we have to meet that responsiblity and have 
done so fitzwater said 
in a report to congress the irancontra prosecutor revealed 
that he wrote bush on oct 19 saying that the administration was 
engaging in interference by invoking national security concerns 
in the case against a former cia station chief joseph fernandez 
without your help the rule of law will be subordinated to the 
intelligence effort wrote walsh the tail has begun to wag the 
dog

fiftyone vietnamese migrants were pulled from 
their beds by security forces before dawn and flown to hanoi today 
in hong kongs first forced repatriation of boat people vietnam 
accepted them but criticized the action 
british and colonial officials ignoring lastminute pleas from 
the united states canada and the human rights group amnesty 
international said it was more humane to ship the vietnamese home 
than to keep them endlessly 
some of the vietnamese screamed for help and one woman waved her 
hands and cried i dont want to back to vietnam 
several thousand more will be returned within weeks said hong 
kong television quoting an unidentified vietnamese foreign 
ministry official a government statement said officials were 
considering using ships 
the british colony currently houses 56000 vietnamese in squalid 
camps where violence and malnutrition are rife among them 44000 
are considered illegal immigrants and will be sent home unless they 
can prove they would face persecution in vietnam hong kong says 
the refugees have strained its facilities 
most are considered economic refugees many risked their lives 
in fleeing the poverty of their homeland putting out to sea in 
rickety boats 
japans kyodo new service in tokyo quoted a vietnamese foreign 
ministry statement in hanoi as saying vietnam accepts voluntary 
returnees but will refuse flatly forced repatriation 
it said the hong kong action this time violates 
humanitarianism but that the 51 vietnamese returned against their 
will would be accepted 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons in 
london that the forcible repatriation is perfectly in order and 
that countries which object should offer them a home 
in washington the bush administration today denounced the 
return as unacceptable 
we continue to support the voluntary repatriation of 
asylumseekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of action 
adopted by the red cross presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
many us lawmakers expressed outrage at the deportations 
this conjures up every picture i have in my mind of world war 
ii concentration camps said rep chet atkins dmass 
the jetliner arrived in hanoi four hours after riot police 
entered a detention center and took the vietnamese under tight 
security and the cover of darkness 
vietnamese screamed for help from the windows at the phoenix 
house detention center during the roundup some hung a sign through 
the metal bars reading where is your humanity 
the boat people were quickly pulled away by police who were 
equipped with helmets shields revolvers and batons sobs could be 
heard coming from the cells 
some held their heads in their hands 
the plane carried eight vietnamese men 17 women and 26 
children the government said in a statement today 
it said the boat people were accompanied by hong kong officials 
and that the expulsions occurred peacefully 
in our view it is more humane to go ahead with the 
repatriation of those who have been through the whole process of 
screening and appeal than to leave them waiting endlessly in 
camps it said 
a police convoy of seven trucks shipped the vietnamese from the 
detention center to kai tak international airport about 200 police 
and corrections officers were involved in the operation 
upon arrival in hanoi the 51 vietnamese were taken to a transit 
center where they will be processed before returning to the 
provinces for job placement and training a diplomatic source in 
hanoi said 
the government said the repatriation program costs about 1000 
per person with the cost shared equally by the hong kong and 
british governments each returning adult received 30 and each 
child 15 with the balance given to vietnamese authorities for 
disbursal the government said 
the hong kong government statement said vietnam has given the 
colony firm assurances that those returning would not be punished 
for having left clandestinely and that their return would 
initially be monitored by the british embassy in hanoi 
it said it hoped the un high commissioner for refugees would 
watch their progress but the relief agency today called the 
mandatory repatriation program premature 
the un group has coordinated a program of voluntary 
repatriation in which 637 vietnamese boat people have returned to 
their communist homeland since march 
the united states has criticized the expulsion plan saying 
conditions must first improve inside vietnam 
some in hong kong say forced repatriation will hurt the 
territorys chances of obtaining international protection from 
communist china which takes control of the colony in 1997 
but li hou a chinese official speaking in canton hailed the 
expulsions today 
forced repatriation should have been used long ago said li 
a highranking official responsible for hong kong affairs 
opponents of forced repatriation have argued that it could 
trigger violence in the detention centers and lead some to try 
suicide vietnamese already have staged hunger strikes and 
demonstrations to protest being sent home against their will 
several bloody riots have broken out 
britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boat 
people from fleeing to overcrowded hong kong 
more than 170000 vietnamese have flocked to hong kong since 
1975 when north vietnam seized control of south vietnam following 
the us withdrawal from the vietnam war 
more than 34000 arrived from jan 1 to nov 10

the following are excerpts of the policy 
speech given tuesday by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
to the berlin press club in west berlin 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as europe changes the instruments for western cooperation 
must adapt working together we must design and gradually put into 
place a new architecture for a new era 
this new architecture must have a place for old foundations 
and structures that remain valuable like nato while recognizing 
that they can also serve new collective purposes the new 
architecture must continue the construction of institutions like 
the ec that can help draw together the west while also serving as 
an open door to the east 
this new structure must also accomplish two special purposes 
first as a part of overcoming the division of europe there must be 
an opportunity to overcome through peace and freedom the division 
of berlin and of germany the united states and nato have stood for 
unification for 40 years and we will not waver from that goal 
as an american i am proud of the role my nation has played 
and will continue to play standing with you yet this very positive 
course will not be easy nor can it be rushed it must be peaceful 
it must be democratic it must respect the legitimate concerns of 
all the participants in the new europe 
nato may have its greatest and most lasting effect on the 
pattern of change by demonstrating to the nations of the east a 
fundamentally different approach to security natos four decades 
offer a vision of cooperation not coercion of open borders not 
iron curtains the reconciliation of ancient enemies which has 
taken place under the umbrella of natos collective security 
offers the nations of eastern europe an appealing model of 
international relations 
as europe moves toward its goal of a common internal market 
and as its institutions for political and security cooperation 
evolve the link between the united states and the european 
community will become even more important we want our 
transatlantic cooperation to keep pace with european integration 
and institutional reform 
i am confident that creative new arrangements can be devised 
to encourage and sustain the process of political and economic 
reform in the countries of eastern europe while at the same time 
preserving the integrity and the vitality of existing institutions 
we need to offer the nations of the east hope opportunities that 
can be seized as they take steps toward democracy and economic 
liberty 
we see no conflict between the process of european integration 
and an expansion of cooperation between the european community and 
its neighbors to the east and west indeed we believe that the 
attraction of the european community for the countries of the east 
depends most on its continued vitality and the vitality of the 
economic community depends in turn on its continued commitment to 
the goal of a united europe envisaged by its founders free 
democratic and closely linked to its north american partners

sharply reduced us intelligence estimates of 
the potential military threat posed by the soviet union and warsaw 
pact were never factored into the process of drafting the pentagon 
budget the chairman of the armed services committee said tuesday 
the result said sen sam nunn dga was that members of 
congress responsible for approving the defense budget were misled 
perhaps inadvertently 
i dont say it was a deliberate coverup nunn told 
reporters what happened here is that the intelligence estimate 
didnt get plugged into their own process 
but he said congressional budget writers were mislead 
nonetheless 
when you dont have the accurate intelligence estimate i 
think it is a misleading budget nunn said 
the complaints from nunn and other committee members about the 
credibility of the budget process came as a senior pentagon 
official confirmed that a new threat estimate by the us 
intelligence community in preparation for months concludes that 
the soviets would take significantly longer than previously 
believed to ready forces to invade western europe 
however paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy 
planning said that the principal reason for the longer warning 
time is the improvement of the reinforcement capabilities of the 
united states and its nato allies 
wolfowitz said that using this longer warning time as a basis on 
which to immediately cut us military forces would be 
shortsighted and counterproductive deep cuts could erase the 
longer warning time and erode nato defenses he said 
reducing natos military punch too soon might lead moscow to 
conclude it could gain a decisive military advantage by moving 
quickly wolfowitz said 
at the same time he said us military planners are working 
under the assumption that political changes in eastern europe and 
the anticipated successful outcome of conventional arms reduction 
talks in vienna will eventually lead to a sharply reduced military 
threat 
but he said that may not be fully evident for four or five years 
wolfowitz declined to confirm reports published in the 
washington post last month that the us intelligence community 
believes nato would have between 33 to 44 days of warning time 
before a soviet attack a change from previous estimates that a 
standing start invasion would require only two weeks of 
mobilization 
wolfowitz did confirm that for the first time since the rise of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the united states sees 
evidence of actual reductions in overall soviet military spending 
but he said that is taking place largely in the conventional 
field with spending on strategic nuclear and naval forces 
remaining level that cannot serve as the rationale for deep cuts 
in us forces because of the incompleteness and reversibility 
of the soviet moves he said 
nunn said that accurate warningtime estimates drive military 
strategy which in turn drives military budgets they are of 
fundamental importance he said 
nunn complained that at the time the new and reduced threat 
assessment was being prepared last spring senior military officers 
were telling congress the soviet threat had not been reduced but 
had actually worsened 
nunn and other senators warned that the pentagon faces a serious 
loss of credibility and possible runaway budget cutting by congress 
if it provides threat estimates that are not factual 
it will be almost impossible to go out an defend a budget that 
is not based on real developments in the world nunn said

mondays launch of the space shuttle 
columbia on a satellite rescue mission might have to be delayed a 
day or two because preparations are behind schedule nasa said 
tuesday 
the target date is still monday but were on a very tight 
schedule and weve got a lot of work to do said space agency 
spokeswoman lisa malone well know more tomorrow after we finish 
the hypergolic propellant loading 
the loading of hypergolic propellants a fuel and oxidizer that 
ignite spontaneously when mixed together for inflight propulsion 
systems and auxiliary power units began a day late monday because a 
faulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced and 
retested 
once the fueling began the launch pad had to be cleared of all 
nonessential personnel because it is considered a hazardous 
operation that prevented workers from making up lost time in other 
areas 
even before the connector problem work was running late because 
of some difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launch 
platform being used for the first time and on launch pad 39b which 
recently underwent a twoyear 50 million refurbishment 
columbia is scheduled to lift off at 731 pm monday with a 
crew of five astronauts who are to deploy a navy communications 
satellite and track down and recover a science satellite that has 
been in orbit for nearly six years 
in announcing the dec 18 launch date for the 10day mission 
which would put the astronauts in space for christmas nasa 
cautioned last week that the flight might have to be delayed a day 
or so 
if the flight is put off more than three or four days officials 
said it probably would be postponed until after christmas to free 
workers for the holiday 
astronaut dan brandenstein will command columbias crew the

the leadership of east germanys embattled 
sports federation resigned today after criticism it was moving away 
too slowly from treating sports mainly as a medalmaking machine 
federation president klaus eichler said he and the rest of the 
secretariat or central administration would step down in response 
to calls for farreaching programs and personnel changes the 
official news agency adn said 
eichler admitted mistakes by the federation leadership in recent 
weeks adn reported the move was announced after an emergency 
meeting of the federations national leadership outside east berlin 
east germany for years concentrated on pumping money into 
certain highperformance sports that yielded a maximum of 
individual medals in international competition such as swimming 
and track and field 
in the course of east germanys peaceful democratic revolt 
former star athletes have come under criticism for enjoying 
privileges popular and official pressure has built up for funding 
more sports facilities for ordinary citizens and promoting sports 
previously deemed secondary by officials such as tennis 
basketball and ice hockey 
speculation about corruption in the federation was fueled when 
franz rydz the vice president for finance apparently drowned 
himself after 162000 was found in his desk east german 
investigators are trying to determine what the money was for 
a statement signed by 192 athletes including olympic shot put 
champion ulf timmermann urged the sports leadership to resign

a former ford motor co executive said 
today a protective cage around the fuel tank of a church bus 
probably would not have prevented a fire that killed 27 people 
the testimony came at larry mahoneys trial on 27 counts of 
murder in a wrongway collision between the bus and mahoneys 
pickup his attorneys say he unknowingly may have drunk 
vodkaspiked soda pop before the may 14 1988 crash 
twentyfour youngsters and three adults died in the accident on 
interstate 71 near here after flames consumed the bus from the 
radcliff first assembly of god church 
although a cage probably would not have prevented the fire 
former ford vice president thomas feahney testified there was 
technology available that could have prevented this tragic 
accident he did not elaborate 
the automotive engineer said the impact caused gasoline to 
squirt like a flame thrower into the passenger section 
on monday defense attorneys sought to establish that the former 
school bus had safety defects that caused it to burst into flames 
the victims died of smoke inhalation or burns rather than of 
injuries from the impact 
part of the defense has been the claim of involuntary 
intoxication defense attorney william summers told reporters 
explaining the significance of testimony that a friend gave mahoney 
a cocktail of diet pepsi and vodka 
to voluntarily drink something youve got to have some idea 
of what youre drinking summers said 
mahoney 36 a factory worker from rural owen county is charged 
with 27 counts of murder 12 of assault 42 of wanton endangerment 
and one of drunken driving 
his bloodalcohol level after the crash tested as high as 024 
percent nearly 2 times the states definition of intoxication 
according to earlier testimony 
among those testifying monday was phil downey a longtime friend 
of mahoneys who was with him at a gathering he left less than an 
hour before the 1055 pm crash 
downey recalled mahoney asking kelly osborne a friend at the 
gathering what he was drinking he said osborne gave mahoney a cup 
of diet pepsi and vodka saying this is better for you than any 
ld beer you ever drank 
mahoney drank the mixture downey testified 
under crossexamination by assistant attorney general paul 
richwalsky jr downey said mahoney appeared drunk when he drove 
away 
he shouldnt have been driving downey said 
summers said he would try to prove mahoney didnt know what was 
in the cup 
the defense contends unsafe design of the 1977 school bus is to 
blame for the deaths a federal investigation after the crash found 
the buss exposed fuel tank prone to fire 
also testifying monday was state fire marshal john william 
martin who said the fire wouldnt have been prevented by a 
protective cage around the bus gas tank the blaze erupted after a 
piece of the buss suspension punctured the tank 
martin said it couldnt be determined if the thick black smoke 
that filled the bus and was blamed for most of the deaths was 
caused by the burning of gasoline alone or the burning of plastic 
seat covers and cushions

a new magazine published by three teachers 
groups will give american students the chance to puzzle over the 
same math and physics problems that confound soviet high school 
students the organizations announced tuesday 
the englishlanguage magazine called quantum is being 
published by te national science teachers association the american 
association of physics teachers and the national council of 
teachers of mathematics in a joint effort with the soviet unions 
academy of sciences 
but bill aldridge executive director of the nsta cautions that 
quantum is not for the average american student 
it is aimed at students who are curious and want to solve 
puzzles in physics and math aldridge said its aimed at the 
very able student 
most of the material in the first issue is based on articles and 
problems that first appeared in kvant a popular soviet magazine 
for high school students 
it includes problems in advanced geometry algebra and in basic 
physics all presented in a lively colorful way and applied to 
actual objects and observations 
there are also chess games and profiles of famous soviet and 
american scientists 
the magazine has a little more life and is more connected to 
what mathematicians really do said william thurston a princeton 
university math professor who is the quantum editor for 
mathematics he said the magazine will offer advanced problems in 
math and physics that students normally would not confront in a 
typical high school classroom 
aldridge said that kvant carries articles and problems written 
by top soviet scientists and are designed to challenge soviet 
students 
in the soviet union ambitious parents subscribe for their 
children hoping that they can get them into the university 
aldridge said 
eventually he said it is hoped that american scientists will 
contribute articles to quantum that would later be translated for 
use in kvant 
aldridge said a computer and a laser printer donated by the 
americans have been installed in the soviet offices of kvant so 
that articles can be transmitted by satellite to the quantum 
editorial offices in washington 
aldridge said president bush presented the first copy of quantum 
to soviet president mikhail gorbachev when the two met for their 
shipboard summit in malta 
the first edition carries little advertising and aldridge said 
it will take about three years for the magazine to reach the 
breakeven point economically until then it is being supported by 
a 366000 national science foundation grant 
the magazine will be published quarterly and the annual 
subscription rate is 995

kidnappers who agreed to release a 
cabinet ministers daughter in exchange for jailed moslem 
separatists demanded that the site for the swap be changed 
officials said tuesday 
thousands of people gathered in the neighborhood called bauri 
kadal in this northern city near the pakistan border anticipating 
the release of the militants some demonstrators set off 
firecrackers and a few groups shouted antiindia slogans 
the separatist kashmir liberation front which claimed 
responsibility for kidnapping rubaiya saeed 22 on friday is 
demanding the release of five to seven militants including abdul 
hamid sheikh the groups leader 
after initial haggling the two sides agreed at midday to

police officer in jammu about 95 miles south of srinagar 
the kidnappers want the jailed militants released at bauri 
kadal said the officer speaking on condition of anonymity they 
promised to free ms sayeed later at an unspecified place he said

this we have a lot of proposals but i cannot disclose them 
now he said 
ms saeed was kidnapped at gunpoint in srinagar her father is 
home minister mufti mohammad sayeed who oversees internal security 
the abduction triggered the first crisis for the 10dayold 
government of prime minister vp singh who last week appointed 
sayeed a moslem as part of an effort to appease moslems in this 
mainly hindu nation 
the kashmir liberation front which wants jammukashmir to 
either become independent or part of islamic pakistan commands a 
large following in the moslemdominated srinagar 
the front formed in 1965 has often attacked the government and 
sponsored successful strikes in jammukashmir indias only moslem 
majority state 
kashmir is claimed both by india and pakistan and the two 
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they 
gained independence from britain in 1947

a senate committee will review the nuclear 
regulatory commissions decision to sell weaponsgrade uranium to 
romania a hardline east bloc country that has been harshly 
criticized by the united states a capitol hill source said tuesday 
one opponent called the sale crazy another said the uranium 
could be used to make a nuclear bomb 
the 164 kilograms of uranium at issue is slated to go to the 
triga research reactor outside bucharest the facility is used for 
training basic research and the production of radioactive isotopes 
commonly used for medical tests but not for weapons 
the sale was approved in august 1988 but us officials have 
refused to ship the uranium stored at oak ridge tenn until the 
romanians come up with a safe way to transport the deadly material 
gary milhollin director of the wisconsin project on nuclear 
arms control a group opposed to nuclear proliferation said the 
material could be used for a bomb 
in light of the romanians increasing isolation and 
instability this is not the time to be sending romania the means 
to make an atomic bomb he said the real risk is that romania 
will sell it to terrorists for hard currency he said 
i think its crazy vladimir tismaneanu a resident scholar 
at the foreign policy research institute in philadelphia said of 
the sale 
tismaneanu said the united states should not provide any 
encouragement to nicolae ceausescu the unpredictable romanian 
leader who has curtailed religious speech and travel freedoms 
ceausescu has scorned the economic and social reforms sweeping 
eastern europe preferring a stalinlike approach to governing 
relations between bucharest and washington have been severely 
strained recently by romanias poor human rights record the 
state department said in a statement we would like to see 
romania join its neighbors in moving towards political and economic 
reforms 
the senate governmental affairs committee will look at the sale 
to make sure the romanians need the uranium to keep the triga 
reactor operating rather than as a reserve supply according to an 
aide who spoke on the condition on anonymity 
the panel which has held hearings on the export of nuclear 
material will also check to satisfy any questions about safeguards 
on the uranium 
the state department said it is confident romania will use and 
store the uranium safely 
appropriate physical security measures are being applied to 
the highly enriched uranium in romania and will be applied to any 
additional nuclear material shipped to that country the 
department said 
us officials say romania met all requirements for the sale 
we have been shipping fuel to romania for a number of years 
said joseph fouchard a spokesman for the nrc we monitor the 
safeguards take a look at their security 
the commission approved a license for the uranium shipment after 
it received the goahead from the reagan administration fouchard 
said 
the uranium is part of a batch that was sold to romania in 1978 
officials said that year the united states shipped 38 kilograms 
to bucharest for use at the triga reactor 
the romanians also paid for the additional 164 kilograms to be 
held in the united states until needed the nrc must issue licenses 
for the export of uranium state department officials said they did 
not know how much romania paid for the material 
an official at the romanian embassy did not respond to questions 
about the uranium

an american was convicted of trying to smuggle 
more than 92000 worth of gold jewels and currency out of the 
soviet union but received a suspended sentence tuesday tass 
reported 
martin mendelson 24 of washington dc was caught at 
leningrad airport sept 25 trying to fly to finland without 
declaring money items of gold and silver and jewels worth a 
great sum the official news agency said 
he had been held in jail since then but was released tuesday 
after a court gave him a threeyear sentence and ordered some of 
the valuables confiscated tass said 
mendelson a tour guide for the new yorkbased russian travel 
bureau had been trying to get the valuables out of the soviet 
union for maya bogdadlishvili 31 of moscow tass said she also 
was given a suspended sentence 
tass said the court took into account the fact that the 
defendants pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions 
soviet customs procedures have become less strict in the last 
year travelers arriving at moscows sheremetyevo airport even have 
the option of passing through a nothingtodeclare customs line 
they are still required to declare valuables and foreign 
currency and the restrictions on what travelers can take out of 
the soviet union have been tightened lately to prevent sorely 
needed consumer goods from leaving the shortageridden country

the us and soviet military conducted their 
first communication tests last week under an agreement designed to 
prevent potentially dangerous clashes the pentagon said tuesday 
its a reflection of an increased element of trust said 
spokesman pete williams its a recognition of the force that 
both sides have and an attempt to avoid any accidents from being 
caused by the inability to communicate with the other side 
the dec 68 exercise was designed to demonstrate the two 
nations armed forces can cooperate in anticipation of an agreement 
scheduled to go into effect jan 1 
the pact was signed last summer by soviet gen mikhail a 
moiseyev and thenchairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm 
william crowe who worked in recent years to increase contact 
between the superpower militaries 
williams said the tests involved ships aircraft and 
groundbased air traffic control and monitoring facilities of both 
us and soviet armed forces 
despite bad weather in the bering sea the tests were 
successful williams said they demonstrated radio 
interoperability and the procedures that have been worked out by 
both sides to prevent potentially dangerous military incidents or 
to quickly resolve them should they occur 
williams said that us and soviet aircraft met at specific 
locations and talked to each other they communicated directly to 
each other 
its a first he said of the tests 
the tests over the bering sea which divides alaska from the 
soviet union included the aircraft from each nation flying over 
the others territory 
the aircraft communicated with both interceptor aircraft there 
and groundbased traffic control and monitoring facilities of the 
other nation williams said 
in the mediterranean the two sides conducted airtosea 
tests by which aircraft from both nations communicated with the 
other nations ships he said 
williams said he could not say how far the aircraft penetrated 
the others territory nor could he say what language was used in 
the transmissions 
the accord is supposed to regulate the operation of military 
forces near each other and avoid such nearmisses as occurred 
earlier this year in the mediterranean 
in september a soviet warship engaged in maneuvers with four 
other soviet ships near crete opened fire on a us navy p3 
surveillance plane barely missing the aircraft 
the navy protested the incident and the soviets apologized us

instead of parliament debating each new law walesa proposed in 
effect that it give the government broad powers to implement 
whatever kind of reform rules it sees as necessary 
the government has not had a chance yet to think about the 
walesa statement said deputy government spokesman henryk 
wozniakowski we are glad for the support which lech walesa 
extends however it is hard to say how useful this proposal 
is 
communist party spokesman jan bisztyga while not specifically 
ruling out walesas proposal said parliament would be the 
appropriate forum for considering economic changes 
walesa said he was moved to propose special powers in order to 
speed up economic reforms 
the situation in the country is getting worse time is running 
out the reserve of social trust is nearly expired the union 
leader said 
prolonged legislative debate would only slow the adoption of the 
necessary laws he said 
that is why one should act quickly and with determination 
walesa said i propose giving the government extraordinary 
powers to address several key issues 
the powers would apply to legal regulations on restructuring the 
economy changing the property system breaking up the monopoly of 
staterun and cooperative enterprises and changing the tax and 
accounting system banking and local government structures walesa 
said 
he said he was fully aware how controversial this proposal is 
but i am forced to make it because of the ever worsening situation 
in the country and the growing impatience of society 
he said the powers should be set by parliament for a specified 
period and for specific areas of activity its two houses the 
sejm and senate could then work quietly on longer term laws 
while retaining the right to correct acts of the government 
one effect of such powers would be to lessen the voice that the 
communist party and its formerly allied parties in the parliament 
in approving or rejecting specific aspects of economic policy 
mazowieckis government is dominated by supporters of 
solidarity who account for 12 seats in the 24member cabinet the 
communists have four 
in the sejm however solidarity has only 35 percent of the 
seats with the communists holding 37 percent 
there were signs last week that some of the governments radical 
economic programs that threaten the position of party members would 
have trouble in the sejm 
for instance some members of the communist party and its former 
allies spoke against a government bill to break up nationwide 
unions of cooperatives dominated by party loyalists 
the cooperative unions set prices and act as virtual monopolies 
in many economic sectors such as the dairy industry and retail food 
sales the government wants to break up the monopolies so that the 
dairies and food stores would be forced to compete against one 
another

a judge today refused to dismiss 
criminal charges against the skipper of the exxon valdez rejecting 
arguments that joseph hazelwood gained immunity from prosecution by 
reporting the spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone said the nations worst oil 
spill would have been discovered within minutes even if hazelwood 
had not radioed in after the tanker hit a reef and began spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
the judge thus ruled that all evidence gathered in the 
investigation except for hazelwoods actual report will be 
admissible at his trial jan 22 
hazelwood is charged with three felonies and three misdemeanors 
in the march 24 accident including operating the tanker while 
under the influence of alcohol 
he could receive up to 10 years in prison and 100000 in fines 
if convicted of the felony offenses 
hazelwoods lawyers had argued the seaman was immune from 
prosecution because state and federal laws protect people who 
report oil spills 
but after listening to two weeks of testimony johnstone 
concluded that if hazelwood had not reported the grounding and the 
spill it would have delayed the coast guards discovery of the 
spill by only 17 minutes 
johnstones ruling appeared to be almost a total victory for 
prosecutors who argued that the intent of the spillreporting 
immunity provisions was not to protect spillers for incidents that 
would have been discovered anyway 
we are breaking new ground in a sensitive area leonard 
linton an assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the 
case told johnstone on monday 
richard friedman one of hazelwoods lawyers argued that 
contract murderers drug dealers and embezzlers are given immunity 
because prosecutors believe making their information public will do 
more good than putting them in jail 
congress conferred immunity he said its not in this 
courts province to tinker with the statute to carve out an 
exception 
johnstone based his ruling on testimony by a radar operator at 
the coast guards traffic monitoring center in valdez 
the operator bruce blandford said that by 1215 am on march 
24 he already was wondering about the location of the tanker he 
said if he hadnt heard from the 987foot vessel by 1230 he would 
have tried to contact it by radio 
had that failed he said at 1245 he would have tried to 
determine the tankers whereabouts by radar hazelwood reported the 
accident at 1228 
blandford said once he heard from hazelwood he adjusted his 
radar and spotted the exxon valdez on bligh reef 
the location alone would have been enough to require that the 
port commander be notified blandford said because he would have 
to assume that hes in big a lot of trouble because i know that 
theres no water there

mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet parliament on 
tuesday rejected reformers efforts to revoke the communist partys 
monopoly on power and push the nation along the road to multiparty 
democracy taken by moscows allies 
but as the congress of peoples deputies began its winter 
session in the kremlin hundreds of parliamentarians supported 
debate on altering the partys legal status indicating the idea is 
gaining popularity as reforms shake the soviet baltic and eastern 
europe 
the congress the 2250member parliament that is theoretically 
the nations highest political body gave gorbachev the agenda he 
wanted for its 10day session gorbachev urged them to focus on the 
economy 
we need drastic reforms the soviet president so far 
there are no improvements in this area 
the key question of the agenda is righting the economy the 
stages of economic reform and our approach to the next fiveyear 
plan gorbachev said he said the country needed as never 
before discipline and responsibility 
in other east bloc developments tuesday 
thousands of bulgarians rallied in sofia outside a communist 
party central committee meeting to make sure the communists keep 
their promises of reforms including free elections and an end to 
the partys monopoly on power an official said the party lacks 
enough talented people to promote its doctrine and manage the 
economy 
secretary of state james a baker iii met in potsdam with east 
german premier hans modrow and told him of us support for the 
reforms taking place there east germanys communist party 
newspaper conceded that a botched brand of socialism has degraded 
living conditions but said those times are past and a new 
democratic socialism is in the making 
czechoslovakias ousted communist hardliners lost their last 
positions of power as parliament formally accepted their 
resignations the battle for president heated up between playwright 
vaclav havel and alexander dubcek 67 the leader of the 1968 
prague spring reforms 
solidarity leader lech walesa said polands government should 
be granted special economic powers allowing it to restructure the 
economy without the approval of parliament 
the soviet deputies met in the kremlin palace of congresses 
before a giant statue of soviet founder vladimir i lenin 
gorbachev pressed the deputies toward a more organized approach to 
their session than the nationally televised freeforall in may and 
june 
only the first few hours were televised live with the rest 
shown on tape tuesday evening however deputies voted later not to 
allow soviet tv to air any debates on ethnic issues after speakers 
touched on the explosive conflict between armenians and 
azerbaijanis that has led to an estimated 200 deaths and hundreds 
of thousands of refugees in the last two years 
despite gorbachevs plea for urgent action on the economy a 
long debate over procedural matters threw the congress behind 
schedule delaying premier nikolai i ryzhkovs economic report 
that report apparently will be based on a longterm plan developed 
by his deputy leonid abalkin that includes making the ruble 
convertible selling off unprofitable state enterprises and 
developing a stock market 
in the first major test only 2 hours after the session began 
the congress rejected a bid by baltic deputies and members of the 
reformist interregional deputies group to debate article 6 of the 
soviet constitution that proclaims the communist party the 
leading and guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its 
political system 
the vote was 1139 to 839 fiftysix deputies abstained it came 
a day after human rights activist andrei d sakharovs call for a 
general strike to press for elimination of article 6 fizzled 
poet yevgeny yevtushenko told the deputies authority must not 
be only written into one paragraph but proven every day he 
called the vote total a noble defeat because 87 percent of the 
deputies are communist party members 
vilen tolpezhnikov a deputy from latvia argued that the party 
is used to usurping power tolpezhnikov a member of a committee 
investigating the military assault on demonstrators in tbilisi 
georgia in april said the decision to use force was made at a 
meeting in the party central committee there were no special 
decrees nobody was taking notes in the course of the conference 
he said 
but he alleged that as a result of the conference defense 
minister dmitri t yazov gave the order to use force 
shovelwielding soldiers killed 19 civilians 
lithuania last week became the first of the 15 soviet republics 
to abolish the communist partys leading role rewriting its 
constitution to allow a multiparty system 
gorbachevs reforms have pushed the soviet unions eastern 
european allies toward radical changes that have ended the 
communist monopoly on power hungary east germany and 
czechoslovakia have removed such language from their constitutions 
and poland has a noncommunist goverment the bulgarian leadership 
has proposed a multiparty system 
soviet communist party ideology chief vadim a medvedev said 
saturday that the party would not maintain its monopoly on power 
at any cost but gorbachev criticized sakharovs strike call as 
an effort at belittling the party or of undermining its prestige 
among the working people 
he called for a sober debate of article 6 we cannot start 
political speculation and thats it he said 
gorbachev also engaged in an angry exchange with sakharov who 
proposed the congress debate not only the partys monopoly on 
political power but all the articles hindering the passing of 
laws on land property and other bills promoting perestroika 
the law on land would allow farmers to pass down to their 
children their rights on stateowned land the law on property 
would widen ownership rights but stops short of allowing private 
property both are considered major pieces of reform legislation 
that will break the topdown control of the economy they were 
debated by the supreme soviet the standing legislature that is 
elected by the congress at its fall session and published for 
public debate 
gorbachev told sakharov i am under the impression that 
neither you nor we will know how to realize your suggestion who is 
to define what articles to exclude 
sakharov then turned to gorbachev and handed him a stack of 
telegrams in support of his position 
you come to me i will give you three files of telegrams 
gorbachev retorted 
when he began to speak about article 6 gorbachev cut him short 
and with a curt thank you 
nevertheless gorbachev brought sakharovs proposal up for a 
vote it was defeated 1415 to 477 a separate proposal to 
specifically debate the laws on land and property was defeated 
1387 to 537

pressured by a steady drain of disillusioned 
workers and increasing calls for reunification east germanys 
communist party conceded tuesday that a flawed brand of socialism 
had hurt living standards 
in the past month the communists have given up their legal 
monopoly on power and that has raised questions about their mandate 
to govern until national parliamentary elections are held may 6 
secretary of state james a baker met in potsdam with communist 
premier hans modrow in a show of support for the nations reforms 
one proreform group demokratischer aufbruch said modrow and 
his cabinet should step down it does not appear that position 
enjoys broad support however since modrow retains a fairly high 
standing among east germans 
communist party leader gregor gysi said his party would not 
allow a foreign policy vacuum to develop despite the upheavals 
of the past two months 
what we need in this country through may 6 is stability 
gysi said when informed of the reform groups demand 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher traveled to 
east berlin to meet with the groups leader rainer eppelmann no 
details of the talks were disclosed 
the partys official daily neues deutschland blamed socialism 
for poor living conditions in the most blunt admission yet of the 
partys culpability in the nations political and economic crisis 
the governmental and administrative socialism has definitely 
failed as a social system in our country the newspaper said 
but it added a new democratic socialism was in the making 
the party appeared torn over the question of closer ties with 
west germany and the newspaper called for a qualified 
partnership acceptable to european neighbors 
allies of east germany and west germany have expressed 
reservations about a confederation between the nations or eventual 
reunification as proposed by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
but the economic crisis that has burdened east germanys more 
than 16 million citizens with problems from pollution to scarce 
consumer goods continues to drive away the nations best hope for 
an improved future its young workers 
a prominent social scientist told the official adn news agency 
that 317500 east germans have fled to the west so far this year 
and that more than 75 percent of them were under age 40 
wulfram speigner of the institute for sociology and social 
policy said the exodus has caused severe labor shortages in 
dresden karlmarxstadt and leipzig 
the exodus peaked this fall and led in part to the ouster of 
longtime party leader erich honecker on oct 18 mass 
demonstrations for reformed continued however and the leadership 
on nov 9 opened its borders including the berlin wall to allow 
citizens to travel freely 
baker visited the wall tuesday and then traveled from west 
berlin to potsdam to meet with modrow it was the first time a us 
secretary of state visited east germany since diplomatic relations 
were established in 1974 
i felt that it was important that we have an opportunity to 
let the premier and the people of east germany know of our support 
for the reforms which are taking place in this country baker 
said later 
modrow said the visit was seen as an endorsement of reform we 
started a dialogue with each other today he said 
also tuesday the two german states agreed to a joint project to 
install 188 new international telephone lines in east germany 
within a week 
communications ministers klaus wolf of east germany and 
christian schwarzschilling of west germany did not say how much 
the project will cost 
wolf said that 98 percent of the existing telephones in east 
germany are worn out and that his ministry has applications for 
12 million new installations in private homes 
schwarzschilling said the new lines will allow 30000 more 
calls a day but were only a drop on a hot stone 
officials said it would cost about 67 billion to bring east 
germanys phone network up to western standards 
despite disagreements over the desired level of cooperation 
between the countries other projects are under negotiation 
west german officials have offered wideranging aid to help east 
germany deal with its economic troubles in return for democratic 
reforms including free elections 
east german officials have characterized those terms as a 
sellout and have tried to work toward reform within a socialist 
structure 
but weekly demonstrations in the city of leipzig have 
illustrated growing support for a confederation or reunification 
with capitalist west germany

the chief navy officer investigating the uss 
iowa explosion acknowledged tuesday that his report contained a key 
factual error but said he stood by its conclusion 
among the initial findings of fact in rear adm richard l 
milligans report was an assertion that the blast was most likely 
triggered by a timing device subsequent laboratory tests have led 
the navy to believe that a chemical device was used 
milligan appearing before a house armed services subcommittee 
was asked why he had not amended his report to reflect that key 
change 
im not trying to smother the world with paperwork he 
replied milligan said that if the subcommittee wished to have the 
report formally changed he would discuss the matter with his 
superiors 
he also conceded that in hindsight he would have done some 
things differently such as moving more quickly to protect 
evidence in the damaged no 2 gun turret of the world war iiera 
battleship 
during a laborious defense of his probe before the subcommittee 
however milligan stuck to his conclusion that gunners mate 2nd 
class clayton hartwig most probably was responsible 
hartwig and 46 iowa crewmates perished in the april 19 incident 
the worst of its kind in navy annals 
milligan and capt joseph d miceli of the naval sea system 
command told the committee they had checked all possible options 
before concluding that the explosion was most likely the result of 
an intentional act by an apparently suicidal hartwig 
intense questioning followed rep nicholas mavroules opening 
statement that his subcommittee had assembled a substantially 
different picture from the one painted by the navy 
milligan completed his initial report july 15 less than three 
months after the explosion the report endorsed by the chief of 
naval operations adm carlisle ah trost and two other reviewing 
officers concluded that the blast apparently had been caused by a 
detonator hartwig placed between gunpowder bags in the turrets 
center 16inch gun 
milligan insisted that in holding the 24yearold hartwig 
responsible he had built a case that would stand up in a court 
of law but the rear admiral reiterated previous statements that 
he could not blame hartwig beyond a shadow of a doubt because 
witnesses died in the explosion 
asked if he had been pushed by the navy to quickly release a 
report milligan replied absolutely not sir if anything i was 
told to take whatever time necessary 
i was given no guidance whatsoever as to what the ultimate 
findings of my investigation were 
several committee members nonetheless faulted milligans 
investigation with some questioning why such an onerous task was 
placed on a person who was not a lawyer and who had not undertaken 
such a mission before 
milligan said he thought he had been chosen by superiors because 
of his 30 years experience in the navy and his command of the uss 
new jersey a battleship virtually identical to the iowa 
mavroules dmass the subcommittee chairman said that while 
he was troubled by conflicts in statements made by individuals 
interviewed by the navy investigators and by his panel i cannot 
explain at this point in time why the differences exist 
but rep les aspin dwis the armed services committee 
chairman told milligan he thought it was wrong for navy 
investigators to rule out a technical reason for the explosion 
just a little bit of humility is required aspin told 
milligan there may yet be a technical explanation out there that 
we havent thought of yet 
under heavy questioning milligan acknowledged that the 
findings of fact in his report were flawed because the report 
ascribed the blast to the placement of a timing device between two 
bags of propellant 
he also said that when he arrived on the iowa the day after the 
explosion he sought immediately to clean up the damaged turret 
authorizing capt fred moosally to assign sailors to remove highly 
flammable hydraulic oil flooding the blast site 
the problem was the danger that existed in the unburnt 
propellant he told mavroules there is always the possibility 
that evidence would be lost but that was a decision i had to make 
to protect the ship 
mavroules aspin and others said they thought milligan had erred 
in failing to immediately call in the naval investigative service 
to protect valuable evidence 
milligan said he initially thought he was investigating an 
accident he said the thought of sabotage did not occur to him 
until it was learned that hartwig had named shipmate kendall truitt 
as a beneficiary on a 100000 life insurance policy 
milligan stressed that the most valuable piece of evidence the 
projectile jammed into the guns bore was protected in fact he 
said it took a month to dislodge it from the guns bore 
truitt who has said he does not believe hartwig blew up the 
ship is scheduled to testify wednesday moosally had told the 
senate armed services committee on monday that he could not share 
the navys conclusion that hartwig likely caused the explosion 
while committing suicide although the captain said he could not 
disprove that theory

britain on tuesday defended its first forced 
repatriation of 51 vietnamese from hong kong and challenged 
countries that protested to open their doors instead 
the united states urged britain to halt mandatory repatriation 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was unacceptable 
until conditions improve in vietnam 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said there would be no more 
forced repatriations until a house of commons debate on dec 19 
although he said britain still plans to deport 44000 vietnamese 
from its colony 
unless it is clear to people in vietnam that those who do not 
qualify as refugees will be returned to vietnam hong kong faces 
the prospect of tens of thousands more arrivals in 1990 this is 
simply not an acceptable prospect he said 
the united states canada and the international human rights 
organization amnesty international had appealed to britain to halt 
the repatriation 
but hong kong security forces went ahead rousting 51 vietnamese 
men women and children from their beds before dawn tuesday and 
putting them on a chartered jet to hanoi vietnam accepted them but 
criticized the action 
this conjures up every picture i have in my mind of world war 
ii concentration camps said rep chet atkins dmass in 
washington how can the british forget historys most agonizing 
lesson and repeat so many of its horrors 
hong kong houses about 57000 vietnamese boat people more than 
90 percent from north vietnam in squalid camps rife with violence 
and malnutrition there were fears that the first forced 
repatriations might touch off protests but a hong kong government 
spokesman said tuesday night that the camps were quiet 
prime minister margaret thatcher said it was more humane to 
repatriate vietnamese who cannot prove they face political 
persecution than to keep them indefinitely in overcrowded camps 
those countries who are protesting at their return would do 
far better if they offered to take some of them she told the 
house of commons amid taunts and jeers from the opposition 
those countries which have shown anger about it have not even 
agreed to take any of the 13000 genuine refugees in hong kong 
for whom we are still seeking a home she said british 
government sources noted that the united states was reluctant to 
take refugees from north vietnam 
us state department spokesman richard boucher said the united 
states believed britain should grant asylum to all those persons 
from vietnam who seek it 
while we may have differences with the british on this action 
we both agree that conditions inside vietnam are the root cause of 
the problem boucher added we hope we can work together to 
deal with this 
british opposition leader neil kinnock accused mrs thatcher of 
acting tyranically and demanded what excuse have you got for 
giving instructions that in the middle of the night armed riot 
police raid children women and men shove them into caged lorries 
trucks and forcibly deport them to the country from which they 
fled 
mrs thatcher denied the police were armed she said the 
international conference on indochinese refugees in june agreed to 
resettle genuine refugees and return those not at risk from 
political persecution to vietnam 
britain said the expelled vietnamese were economic migrants 
hurd stressed that the criteria for qualifying as a refugee was 
decided by britain in agreement with the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees and that every vietnamese had a right of 
appeal 
the un group said tuesday it regards the forced repatriation 
of the 51 vietnamese as premature but said it was satisfied that 
none of them were genuine refugees 
the group has refused to take part in any mandatory return it 
is coordinating a voluntary repatriation plan strongly backed by 
the united states under which 637 vietnamese have returned since 
march more than 1000 are registered to go back 
japans kyodo news service quoted a vietnamese foreign ministry 
statement in hanoi as saying vietnam in principle has accepted 
voluntary returnees but will refuse flatly forced repatriation 
hong kongs action this time violates humanitarianism the 
foreign ministry was quoted as saying but that the 51 vietnamese 
would be accepted 
hurd said voluntary repatriation will not match the scale of 
the problem and said britain hoped to get vietnams agreement to 
accept returnees voluntary and involuntary at a faster rate 
vietnam had told britain that those repatriated would not be 
punished for leaving he said government sources said there had 
been no problems with those who previously returned home 
voluntarily 
the british embassy in hanoi will monitor conditions of those 
forcibly repatriated hurd said britain also wants the un group 
to participate in the monitoring although it has so far refused 
government sources said 
hurd said two former ministers conservative timothy raison 
laborite lord ennals will visit vietnam next month to report on 
the condition of the 51 boat people sent back tuesday

the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem said 
tuesday that tough israeli tactics against the palestinian uprising 
could backfire and create increasing insecurity for the jewish 
state 
archbishop michel sabbah the first arab to head the catholic 
church in jerusalem said in an interview that he has expressed 
this view in meetings with the ministry of religious affairs his 
channel to the israeli government 
we tell them they are doing wrong sabbah said through 
all this violence they are not achieving any gain for the 
israelis themselves instead they are doing the opposite making 
martyrs among the palestinians that just helps build strength 
among the palestinian people 
sabbah argued the secure borders desired by israel cannot be 
achieved by continued occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
home to 17 million palestinians 
the territories were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war and have been torn for the last two years 
by a palestinian revolt against israeli rule that has taken more 
than 800 lives 
asked if he favors an independent palestinian state he said 
that this is a political a technical issue to be left for 
negotiations 
the problem is to live free without being under submission to 
anyone else he said leaders can decide if this requires a 
state a confederation a federation 
sabbah 56 was appointed patriarch by the vatican less than a 
month after the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 and is 
responsible for the 65000 roman catholics who live in jordan 
cyprus israel and the west bank 
he was born in nazareth now part of israel and educated at a 
seminary in the west bank village of beit jala and st josephs

police fired on striking black 
transport workers tuesday injuring 50 officials said and a bomb 
exploded on a railway line near cape town forcing the cancellation 
of rushhour trains 
the staterun south african transport services dismissed 1073 
strikers raising the total fired during a sixweek walkout to 
12617 
witnesses and hospital personnel said police used rubber 
bullets buckshot and birdshot on about 500 strikers in cape town 
as they marched on the main railway building 
fifty men were hospitalized and at least eight required surgery 
according to officials at groote schuur hospital and the gatesville 
medical center 
the workers had marched the same route almost daily during the 
strike without serious incident they said they did not hear any 
warnings from police before the shooting began 
the explosion before dawn outside cape town damaged a rail line 
and forced the cancellation of 30 morning rushhour trains the 
transportation company said thousands of commuters were affected 
the company added 
police investigated the possibility that two bombings monday 
night in johannesburg were linked to the strike one blast 
shattered windows in an area near the business office of the 
transport company and the other killed two indian men at 
johannesburgs main railroad station 
police on tuesday said they found limpet mines ak47 rifles 
hand grenades and pistols at the home of one of the slain men 
yusuf akhalwaya 23 
the other man prakash napier 24 was believed to be carrying a 
limpet mine and working with akhalwaya when it detonated 
unexpectedly police said 
prior to the bombings five people had been killed in 
strikerelated violence there have been many arson and sabotage 
attacks that the company has blamed on strikers 
in soweto the township outside johannesburg a grenade thrown 
from a moving trains injured two men waiting at a station tuesday 
police said 
about 20000 workers walked out nov 2 demanding the minimum 
monthly wage be increased from 225 to 560 the strikers also are 
demanding formal recognition of their union the south african 
railway and harbor workers union 
management has refused to enter wage talks saying a pay hike 
was negotiated earlier this year the company has been firing 
workers steadily and says all will be dismissed unless they return 
to work 
whites employed by the 170000worker company make significantly 
more money for the most part and dominate administrative and 
supervisory posts 
company officials say damage to property during the strike 
exceeds 8 million but they say their rail and harbor operations 
have not been seriously affected by the walkout which is illegal 
under legislation that bars strikes in essential services

the united states on tuesday promised more 
than 100000 metric tons of new food aid to ethiopia to help soften 
the blow of a drought that threatens to be as bad as the 1984 
disaster in which an estimated 1 million people died 
and mark l edelman acting director of the us agency for 
international development welcomed reports that ethiopias 
hardline marxist government will allow a corridor for food aid to 
flow to people in the embattled northern provinces of eritrea and 
tigray 
if it is true i am absolutely delighted said edelman 
i congratulate president mengistu for doing it 
a severe drought in the two provinces coupled with what edelman 
called the governments discredited agricultural policies and the 
continuing civil war have placed 5 million people at risk of 
starvation he said 
we are trying to save the people of ethiopia from their own 
government edelman added 
these numbers suggest we are dealing with a situation at least 
as bad as in 1987 and possibly as bad as 1984 when a massive but 
belated international relief effort failed to head off the deaths 
of an estimated 1 million ethiopians he said 
this time edelman contended the us relief agency is ahead 
of the curve some 53800 metric tons of food is arriving from 
the united states this month the additional 111400 tons approved 
tuesday will put the value of us food aid committed since oct 1 
at 70 million 
the aid is to help meet a total need of up to 750000 metric 
tons of food to offset the droughts effects the ethiopian 
government and the united nations have put out a worldwide appeal 
for help 
any relief effort is complicated by the war raging across 
northern ethiopia where two rebel groups control much of the 
territory and where a large expanse extending into two other 
provinces wello and gonder also is contested relief officials 
are seeking to get all parties in the conflict to establish 
corridors where relief vehicles can safely pass battle lines so 
that food shipments can reach the droughtstricken area 
kenyan president daniel arap moi said tuesday the addis ababa 
government has agreed to the establishment of corridors and said 
he had asked the rebel groups to do the same 
the primary corridor sought is a road extending sought from the 
red sea port of massawa which is controlled by the mengistu 
government into tigray a secondary corridor would be established 
from the red sea port of aseb southwestward through wello 
edelman said the announcement was being made because it has 
recently become apparent that the need is going to be much 
greater than we thought 
we do not believe it will be possible to avert starvation in 
northern ethiopia or to prevent large movements of people out of 
droughtstricken areas unless such a plan can be implemented he 
said 
such migrations in the 198485 famine led to vast overcrowded 
and unsanitary camps where as many people died from disease as from 
hunger 
now is the time for the government of ethiopia and the world 
community to join together in an urgent concerted effort to 
prevent the human tragedy of another famine in ethiopia he said

vasil bilak the hardline 
communist viewed by many here as the most culpable for the 1968 
invasion denied tuesday that he invited in sovietled troops to 
crush the prague spring reforms 
bilak was charged monday on two unspecified counts that the 
state news agency ctk said were connected with the events of 1968 
according to some opinions his deeds can be considered 
treason ctk said but added that bilak would not face trial 
because of a 20year statute of limitation on the alleged crimes 
bilak 72 is a deputy in the national parliament during a 
break in a parliamentary session he blamed the soviet union for 
the invasion which involved troops of the red army and four other 
warsaw pact nations 
i did not invite them do you think im so strong that i can 
invite five armies and they will come he said 
bilak added if i invite you to dinner and you say no then 
you dont come the responsibility is on the one who comes not the 
one who invites they didnt have to come 
he also said the historic context of the invasion had been 
forgotten 
it was the peak of the cold war bilak said it was 
horrible 
in similar comments to ctk bilak said the invading countries 
faced the threat of world war iii 
until the recent reforms czechoslovakia maintained in 
accordance with soviet views at the time that the invasion was 
necessary to stop a counterrevolution 
it has since been declared a mistake and a commission of 
historians will investigate it 
bilak told ctk that in 1968 it was said in moscow they cannot 
tolerate liquidation of something for which 20 million people 
died a reference to the soviets who died defending their country 
in world war ii 
the communist party daily pravda in bilaks native slovakia said 
tuesday that he brought shame on his party by acquiring a luxurious 
villa for a small price after the state invested ten times the sum 
to renovate it 
the villa stands in the exclusive slavin district of bratislava 
near the home of alexander dubcek the leader of the prague 
spring reforms 
bilak was slovak communist party chief under dubcek who was 
national party head at the time 
pravda also noted that bilaks villa once belonged to slovak 
allies of the nazis 
such gibes once were reserved for opposition leader vaclav 
havel his family built a prague ballroom complex containing an 
office used by the nazis a fact frequently mentioned in past media 
attacks on havel 
asked about the current reforms that have overturned the 
hardline policies he propagated as party ideology chief until 
october 1988 bilak said the move toward democracy was good and bad 
when the people ask for more democracy more freedom thats 
ok but when they persecute one another it subverts the very thing 
that is being asked for he said

a bolivian colonel dubbed his nations minister 
of cocaine in the early 1980s was ordered held without bond 
tuesday on drugtrafficking charges that could send him to prison 
for 30 years 
luis arce gomez was a fugitive for six years until sunday when 
bolivian authorities raided his ranch and put him on a drug 
enforcement administration plane bound for the united states 
human rights groups have accused arce gomez of running death 
squads that hunted down tortured and killed enemies of the 
military government with the help of fugitive nazi klaus barbie 
bringing him to trial is a significant strike against the 
danger posed to the united states by those who deal in narcotics 
said diane cossin executive assistant to us attorney dexter 
lehtinen we hope to convict him of these charges and have him 
spend time in prison 
arce gomez wearing a tshirt slacks and sandals responded 
with i understand after he was read a summary of charges at a 
hearing before us magistrate william turnoff 
he was represented by jose quinon one of carlos lehder rivas 
attorneys during his trial in jacksonville last year 
lehder rivas who is colombian was convicted of masterminding a 
massive cocaine conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison 
arce gomez his hands clasped behind his back spoke up at the 
end of his hearing to request that the records from a 1983 
extradition hearing in argentina be preserved for his defense 
he emerged victorious out of that hearing and he wants to make 
sure that any proof presented there is preserved his attorney 
said 
turnoff ordered an arraignment and formal bond hearing for dec 
26 in fort lauderdale where previous trials on the indictment have 
been held 
the 1983 miami indictment against arce gomez and his top aides 
accuses them of setting up a protection racket for drug traffickers 
in bolivia charging them huge sums to continue business as much 
as 75000 every two weeks to look the other way according to some 
reports 
one count of the indictment says he ordered the release of 
confiscated cocaine stored in bank vaults after the payment to his 
aides of 15 million 
on the charges of conspiracy to import cocaine to the united 
states and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute 
arce gomez faces 15 years and a 25000 fine on each count he was 
being held at the federal metropolitan correctional center 
southwest of miami 
arce gomez took over the interior ministry after a july 1980 
military coup against bolivias civilian government and was 
considered the regimes strongman us and latin american 
officials at the time called the takeover a cocaine coup 
financed by traffickers and arce gomez became widely known as 
minister of cocaine 
he had a fleet of 11 airplanes a mansion in the bolivian drug 
production center of santa cruz a hacienda with a private lighted 
airstrip and another mansion in la paz 
in december 1980 he came to the united states to try to improve 
relations strained by rampant human rights abuses and cocaine 
trafficking in bolivia the state department made it clear that he 
was not welcome and denied his request to lay a wreath at the tomb 
of the unknown soldier 
on march 1 1980 cbs 60 minutes program detailed arce 
gomezs drug connections and included accusations against him by 
thendea chief peter bennsinger and us sen dennis deconcini 
dariz 
two days later deconcini was told by the fbi that arce gomez had 
put a contract out on his life said the senators aide amy 
silverman deconcini was guarded fulltime for the next three 
months she said tuesday 
under growing pressure from the united states and from within 
the bolivian military arce gomez was forced out of office at the 
end of march 1981 when civilian rule returned to bolivia in 1982 
he fled the country for argentina to avoid arrest 
argentinas military government arrested him following the 1983 
indictment in miami but released him on a technicality only days 
before civilian president raul alfonsin took over that nations 
reins in december 1983 
bolivia meanwhile stripped him of his citizenship when he 
failed to show up at his trial on human rights abuses arce gomez 
had been a fugitive until his arrest sunday 
seventeen other people were indicted five including his former 
top aide rene benitez have pleaded guilty or been convicted 
eleven others are fugitives and one ana rodriguez de tamayo has 
pleaded innocent in the case after being extradited from colombia

a rookie police officer was reprimanded for 
covering his badge with black tape as a show of support for a 
colleague convicted of manslaughter the symbol usually is reserved 
for slain officers 
i felt it was a dishonor to those police officers who had lost 
their lives in the line of duty said police chief perry 
anderson to see an officer wearing that for any other reason 
for any other expression is unforgiveable 
alejandro mendez was cited friday for unbecoming conduct in 
support of william lozano convicted last week in the deaths of two 
black men 
the shooting deaths provoked three days of rioting that left one 
man dead and more than 1 million damage lozano is scheduled to be 
sentenced jan 24 
other officers say mendez is among many in the police department 
who have rallied to lozanos defense 
some officers have signed a petition urging dade circuit judge 
joseph farina to allow lozano to remain free on bond pending 
appeals 
the police department has to be impartial said anderson 
to put something on thats not authorized to make an officer 
stand out to show that he favors or disfavors any kind of action 
would go against the grain of professionalism 
mendez 22 apologized to the chief 
i didnt mean anything disrespectful he said 
but the hispanic officers association intends to fight the 
reprimand 
i think theyre taking away the kids constitutional right to 
express his feelings said martin garcia president of the 
368member association of miami officers

two congressmen introduced legislation tuesday 
that would jail those responsible for environmental disasters that 
cause death injury or severe damage 
those who might wreak havoc on our environment should be 
scared said rep charles schumer dny 
the bill sponsored by schumer and rep george gekas rpa 
would establish punishments ranging from 15 years in jail and a 
250000 fine for a first offense to 30 years in jail and a 2 
million fine for subsequent offenses 
the bill also would allow the court to sentence an organization 
or company convicted of an environmental offense to probation and 
require an independent environmental audit the audit would 
identify pollutants and recommend prevention measures the court 
could require the defendant to implement 
the national resources defense council in testimony before 
schumers judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice said the 
legislation is desperately needed and should be made even stronger 
the american petroleum institute however called the 
legislation flawed and uncessary 
while from time to time it is suggested that enforcement of 
one statute or another could be more vigorous we are not aware of 
any suggestions that the current criminal provisions on the whole 
are inadequate to deter irresponsible behavior that endangers the 
environment said api vice president g william frick 
george van cleve deputy assistant attorney general in the 
justice department said the bush administration favors stiffening 
punishments for violations of antipollution laws 
however he said the administration has some problems of a 
general character with the bill suggesting intergrating concepts 
offered by the bill into existing laws

the bush administration tuesday condemned 
britains decision to send vietnamese refugees in hong kong back to 
their homeland and appealed for the forced return flights to cease 
on humanitarian grounds 
more vietnamese might be allowed into the united states if hong 
kong persists in deporting vietnamese boat people officials said 
the us position is that involuntary repatriation is 
unacceptable until conditions improve in vietnam said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
we continue to support the voluntary repatriation of asylum 
seekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of action adopted by 
the red cross he added 
in london foreign secretary douglas hurd said there would be no 
more flights until the house of commons debates the issue on dec 
19 
fiftytwo vietnamese migrants were roused from their beds by 
security forces before dawn and put on a chartered jet to hanoi in 
hong kongs first forced repatriation of boat people 
the british colony currently houses about 57000 vietnamese in 
squalid camps britain contends they are not true refugees because 
they did not flee persecution but simply sought a better life 
economically 
fitzwater noting that the united states had accepted 50000 
vietnamese in the last year cited humanitarian arguments against 
forcing boat people to return against their will 
we recognize the large number of vietnamese asylumseekers in 
hong kong has strained their resources however we believe that 
these pressures are best alleviated through the type of concerted 
international action called for by the international red cross 
he said 
he said us position is that the country of first asylum has 
responsibility in this case the british colony 
rep duncan hunter rcalif chairman of the house republican 
research committee called the repatriation totally outrageous 
and urged hong kong and britain to reconsider or face the scorn 
of the world community 
all free men should be disgusted by hong kongs actions 
hunter said the boat people braved stormy seas leaky boats and 
pirates to escape communist vietnam now hong kong one of the 
miracles of democracy and free enterprise is dragging the boat 
people kicking and screaming back to vietnam 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher said the 
united states deeply regrets the forcible repatriation of 
vietnamese asylum seekers from hong kong to vietnam 
we believe that the british government should not proceed 
further with mandatory repatriation from hong kong we believe that 
british authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those 
persons from vietnam who seek it boucher said 
he cited a june agreement to that effect reached in geneva by 
the united states the british vietnam and other southeast asian 
nations 
while we may have differences with the british on this action 
we both agree that conditions inside vietnam are the root cause of 
the problem we hope we can work together to deal with this he 
said 
he added that the united states continues to press vietnam for a 
comprehensive settlement of the cambodian conflict that would pave 
way for a more normal political situation throughout the region 
an administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that it was likely that the united states would 
increase the number of vietnamese refugees it takes as a result of 
hong kongs action 
however the official said there are limits 
the official said that there is already a process under which 
some vietnamese refugees who escaped to hong kong have been given a 
safe haven in the united states 
since the north vietnamese conquest of south vietnam in 1975 
the united states has accepted 930000 immigrants from vietnam 
laos and cambodia far more than any other country

at potsdam where world leaders reshaped europe at the end of 
world war ii events brought east and west together again tuesday 
to survey a europe that is reshaping itself 
at potsdam in the summer of 1945 the big three 
churchill stalin and truman reordered the postwar world 
at potsdam on tuesday the secretary of state james a baker 
iii met east germanys new communist premier hans modrow with 
far less certainty that they could fix or even anticipate the new 
world order 
potsdam is a lakeside suburb of berlin it was the seat of power 
of the hohenzollern family which ruled prussia before world war i 
it was where word was flashed to harry truman that the atom bomb 
had been successfully tested in the new mexico desert 
truman told winston churchill about the bomb and churchill 
replied this is the second coming in wrath josef stalin told 
truman that the soviet union would enter the war against japan 
at potsdam the three men agreed to the division of germany and 
accepted the russian occupation of east europe it was to be a 
temporary expedient but until the remarkable autumn of 1989 it 
became a lasting arrangement 
the hot war had not ended but the cold war had started 
now maybe it is ending at potsdam at the berlin wall and 
on the streets and in the parliament halls of east europe mikhail 
gorbachev says it is already over but president bush says he is not 
prepared to go that far 
baker and modrow met just as bush and gorbachev met 10 days 
earlier off malta to size up the direction of a world in flux 
the secretary and the premier could not hope to take charge of 
where it was going people in the streets of berlin had brought 
down the wall with willpower and hammers and chisels berliners 
brought down erich honecker the old hardliner and even egon 
krenz honeckers more conciliatory successor 
while baker and modrow met gorbachev was in moscow staving off 
an attempt in the soviet parliament to install a multiparty system 
in the soviet union 
in czechoslovakia the parliament formally accepted the 
resignations of that countrys ousted hardline communists who sat 
by with stony faces from sofia came word that the fever had spread 
to yet another bloc country bulgarian communist party leader petar 
mladenov offered to renounce the partys leading role and 
engage in dialogue with his critics 
one days news from the east 
truman had not been in office four months and world war ii had 
not yet ended in the pacific when he secretly boarded the uss 
augusta for the eightday trip to europe and his first meeting with 
stalin whose arrival at potsdam was delayed by a slight heart 
attack and with churchill who brought along opposition leader 
clement attlee because it was uncertain who would win the election 
at home 
britons had gone to the polls but the soldier vote had not been 
gathered churchill and attlee broke off the talks to await the 
returns at home when the vote was in the wartime prime minister 
had been ousted by a warweary nation attlee returned to the 
conference alone 
the three leaders conferred over a 16day period agreeing on a 
provisional division of germany that has lasted 44 years 
truman asked for free elections in hungary rumania and bulgaria 
stalin said no deal according to historians samuel eliot 
morison henry steele commager and william leuchtenburg the soviet 
replied any freely elected government in these countries will be 
an antisoviet government and we cannot allow that 
the soviets took over the baltics and vast stretches of poland 
they installed communist governments in east germany and all the 
lands they occupied when the fighting ended arrangements that were 
intended to be temporary hardened 
on tuesday the united states and east germany conferred again 
about the future 
after seeing baker modrow said we started a dialogue with 
each other today but it was clear that the last word in this 
dialogue will be spoken by the people

secretary of state james a baker 
iii ventured into east germany on tuesday and offered us economic 
assistance to still another soviet ally bent on reform 
the bold and unprecedented visit to the site where the world war 
ii allies decided the future of a vanquished germany was made after 
baker sent a telegram to moscow advising the soviets of his 
intentions 
in a 65minute session with prime minister hans modrow and then 
a separate talk in a 19th century church with lutheran ministers 
baker registered support for the changes sweeping the onetime 
stalinist state and said the bush administration was prepared to 
provide the kind of help due poland and hungary as they turn toward 
market economies 
but he emphasized that the change must be peaceful us 
officials said baker was concerned that retribution against fomer 
communist party officials could turn into uncontrollable violence 
with unpredictable consequences to its neighbors 
standing alongside modrow at the conclusion of their meeting 
baker said they had talked about the importance of moving forward 
peaceably and in a stable way 
it is that as much as anything else that represents the 
political signal that we desire to send by being here today 
baker said 
the prime minister who was lifted by the changes in east 
germany from a minor party post told baker the evolution in the 
country which will lead to multiparty elections in may was 
irreversible us officials said 
modrows public statement was cautious he said his session with 
baker was the beginning of a dialogue that would turn out to be 
cooperative 
bakers visit to potsdam the site of a 1945 conference that set 
conditions for the postworld war ii division of defeated germany 
was added suddenly to his schedule late monday night 
in the morning baker sent a telegram to moscow to advise the 
soviet union of his plan there was no immediate reply but a 
senior us official told reporters on bakers flight to brussels 
on tuesday night for meetings later in the week with nato and 
european community leaders that the soviets will be very pleased 
with the fact that we had this meeting 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said both the 
soviets and the east germans had advised the united states that 
they wanted the reform to proceed i dont anticipate any problem 
at all from that standpoint he said 
baker is the first secretary of state to hold talks with east 
german officials two of his predecessors john foster dulles in 
the 1950s and william p rogers in 1971 visited east berlin but 
they did not go beyond the sovietcontrolled sector of the former 
capital 
former president harry s trumans participation in the potsdam 
conference in 1945 carried him beyond berlin but truman met with 
soviet leader josef stalin and british prime ministers winston 
churchill and clement attlee 
i felt it was important that we have an opportunity to let the 
premier and the people of the german democratic republic know of 
our support for the reforms that are taking place in this 
country baker said when asked to explain the decision to go to 
potsdam 
we wanted to make sure they are aware of the support that 
exists in the united states forthe democratic process we also 
wanted to make it very clear that we support the process of reform 
in a peaceful way he said 
the lutheran ministers some of whom were opponents of the 
communist government assured baker they would continue to advance 
reforms while also doing what they could to keep the political 
upheaval on a peaceful plane the us officials said 
while baker made no explicit promises to modrow they said he 
held out the prospect of lower tariffs provided the east german 
government took legal steps to ensure the right to emigrate to the 
west 
he also told modrow that east germany could expect the same kind 
of aid from the west that is being extended to hungary and poland 
if you carry forward with your reforms as you have promised the 
people you are going to do and you have a government that can 
speak for the people and that represents the people a senior us 
official said 
president bush last month signed legislation for a 938 million 
aid package for poland and hungary other western countries and 
japan are engaged in parallel assistance programs 
before baker crossed into east germany he celebrated the opening 
of the opening of the berlin wall and made a speech outlining the 
bush administrations proposed new architecture for a changing 
europe with a larger role for the north atlantic treaty 
organization and closer us ties to the 12nation european 
community 
before driving over the glienicke bridge and past impassive 
border guards baker visited potsdamer platz where a new crossing 
point in the berlin wall was opened last month 
its pretty impressive he said as he toured the site with 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher on a cold 
lateautumn day 
demonstrators nearby protested against us policies in central 
america shouting yankees out of el salvador 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who met with baker in west 
berlin and genscher have offered assurances to the soviets that 
the reunited germany they are seeking would not threaten the 
security of its neighbors 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze warned genscher 
last week that reunification could only bring trouble 
shevardnadze recalled the suffering from the german invasion in 
world war ii and told genscher that propaganda about a federation 
of two germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the current 
circumstances 
the soviets denounced kohls recent 10point plan for eventual 
reunification as fraught with dangerous consequences and 
bordering on outright diktat 
but baker said events in eastern europe that under the old 
rules of the game would have invited a soviet crackdown have 
produced no sign of it this time the senior us official said 
until we do i dont think we are going to get it he said 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo and rep tom 
lantos dcalif also arranged to see modrow later 
in a policy speech to the berlin press club baker said the 
united states and canada share europes neighborhood and intend 
to work with west europeans to peacefully integrate a reunified 
germany into a europe in which eastwest tensions are subsiding 
baker has been pushing for a goslow approach to reunification 
saying the future of the two germanys should not be determined 
exclusively by the german people 
baker suggested nato oversee reductions of troops and armaments 
in a treaty being negotiated with the sovietled warsaw pact and 
take new steps to build economic and political ties with the east 
as europe changes the instruments for western cooperation 
must adapt baker said working together we must design and 
gradually put into place an architecture for a new era

house democrats angry about the 
administrations overtures to china on tuesday predicted strong 
bipartisan support when congress tries to override president bushs 
veto of a bill aiding chinese students in this country 
i think we have enough to override said rep nancy pelosi 
dcalif we feel the presidents actions this weekend are such a 
slap in the face to the forces of democracy and such an 
encouragement of a tyrannical regime that it is making our job 
easier 
pelosi said she had received assurances from house and senate 
leaders including house speaker tom foley that congress would 
make consideration of the veto override its first order of business 
when it reconvenes in january 
the vetoed bill sponsored by pelosi would allow chinese 
students to remain in the united states indefinitely if they fear 
retaliation at home bush contended he could accomplish the same 
thing by executive order 
the bill passed congress overwhelmingly last month pelosi said 
at a news conference that she was gaining commitments from 
democrats and republicans to support an override predicting a 
strong bipartisan majority 
democratic leaders made clear their strong disagreement with 
bushs decision to send national security adviser brent scowcroft 
and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to beijing over 
the weekend for the first highlevel meetings with chinese leaders 
since the crackdown in tiananmen square in june 
rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on international economic policy and trade 
called the trip an outrage a disaster 
he scheduled a wednesday hearing on the trip and said 
eagleburger was invited to testify 
the butchers of beijing have been consolidating their power 
increasing tyranny in china and the administation then goes and 
sends two of its top people to china gejdenson said 
what kind of message is this to those in the east bloc who 
want to use military force to crush the democratic movements he 
asked is this a statement by the administration that it has one 
standard for human rights in eastern europe and another standard 
for human rights in asia 
bush gained support however from rep jim leach riowa who 
called the criticism premature and said the trip was a risky but 
thoughtful consultation that could lead to moderation by china 
if china significantly moderates over the course of the next 
year bush will be vindicated leach said if not the 
administration runs the danger of being perceived as helping to 
legitimize a less than legitimate regime in beijing 
haiching zhao chairman of the national committee on chinese 
student affairs met with pelosi later telling reporters the visit 
will strengthen the hardliners in beijing and encourage a slide 
into darkness 
taken together the veto and the visit create a clear and 
present danger that the hardliners in the chinese government will 
now feel free to impose more repression and further reprisals 
against the democracy movement he said 
zhao said thousands of young people are being jailed and 
tortured in china and that the government has begun a new round of 
suppression against intellectuals 
in the united states he said some chinese students who have 
demonstrated against their government have been intimidated and 
harassed by chinese authorities he said the chinese government has 
warned students that if they persist they will be regarded as 
counterrevoluntionaries and punished when they return to china

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that the 
display of a 16foot menorah in a burlington vt park is 
unconstitutional because it violates the separation of church and 
state 
in a 21 decision the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
reversed a lower courts decision allowing the city to issue a 
permit to a jewish group to erect the menorah in a park next to 
city hall 
the menorah the symbol of the jewish religious holiday 
hanukkah was displayed during the holiday season in 1986 1987 and 
1988 the 16foothigh 12footwide candelabrum bore a sign saying 
it was sponsored by lubavitch of vermont a group of orthodox jews 
the appeals judges based their decision on a us supreme court 
ruling in july that a creche inside a pittsburgh courthouse was not 
permissible but a menorah in front of a nearby government building 
was because it was paired with a christmas tree 
judges edward j lumbard and wilfred feinberg said the high 
courts ruling teaches that the display of a menorah on 
government property in this case conveys a message of government 
endorsement of religion 
in a dissenting opinion judge thomas meskill said he did not 
agree that the placement of the menorah next to city hall gave the 
impression that the display was government sponsored 
rather the denial of permission to display the menorah would 
constitute unnecessary hostility toward religion meskill said 
burlington city attorney joseph e mcneil said he had not yet 
seen the decision and could not say whether the city would appeal 
the ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a lawyer a rabbi 
and a protestant minister living in burlington which challenged the 
display 
our reasoning was that it was a clear violation of church and 
state mainly because of its position with city hall in the 
background said plaintiff mark a kaplan a lawyer who is on the 
board of directors of the vermont chapter of the american civil 
liberties union 
the appeal followed a ruling in december 1988 by us district 
judge franklin s billings jr of vermont who said the city could 
issue a permit for the display 
kaplan whose office is adjacent to city hall park in 
burlington said the menorah is not on display now

him she said

democracies in the east

germany match those of poland and hungary we believe the 
activities of the group of 24 centered around the ec should be 
expanded to support peaceful change in these countries as well

operation should be extended as soon as circumstances permit to 
east germany and czechoslovakia

the salvadoran ambassador to the united states 
said tuesday that american jennifer casolo would likely be released 
if she cooperated with police in an investigation of a suspected 
rebel arms cache 
ambassador miguel angel salaverria told reporters after a 
briefing with rep nancy johnson a republican from casolos home 
state of connecticut that the woman may have been unaware of arms 
hidden in the backyard of her san salvador apartment 
but he said she needs to say who she rented the house from 
the more she cooperates the easier it will be to end the 
case 
rumors of casolos impending release reached washington tuesday 
generated by comments from her salvadoran lawyer but the judge 
handling the case said there was a misunderstanding and he had 
made no such decision 
in another development white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater apologized for remarks made last month shortly after 
casolos arrest by salvadoran police 
its fairly clear that these weapons were found there 
fitzwater said at the time i mean were not talking about a 
small package of pistols here this is hardly a case of someone 
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home 
congressional democrats blasted fitzwater for making comments 
they said indicated to the salvadoran government that the bush 
administration supported prosecution of the case 
on tuesday fitzwater denied that he had suggested casolo was 
guilty but added i certainly apologize to anyone who feels that 
they were offended by that 
casolo 28 went to el salvador in 1985 to work for christian 
education seminars a group dedicated to influencing us policy by 
organizing tours for americans to learn about the civil war there 
she and two salvadoran friends were arrested nov 26 after a

the nicaraguan government and the 
opposition have waged a dirty election campaign over the airwaves 
a un report said tuesday 
un pollwatchers led by former us attorney general elliot l 
richardson said the sandinista government identifies the entire 
opposition coalition with ousted strongman anastasio somozas 
national guard and with counterrevolution war and death 
the report criticized the opposition for contending that fraud 
will be the only possible explanation for defeat in the election 
set for february 
in this atmosphere of anticipated fraud and the mixing of war 
with politics the electoral process is liable to lose its central 
position said the report by richardson 
if armed conflict emerges even implicitly as a possible 
solution the electoral process is bound to be perceived as a 
secondary solution he warned 
on sunday an opposition rally in masatepe nicaragua broke 
into a riot in which one person was killed and more than 20 
injured foreign observers blamed the violence on sandinista 
provocateurs 
policy debate or genuine political proposals take backstage to 
volleys of accusations and epithets richardson said in his 
report filed beforele 
registered to vote 885 percent of the potential electorate 
richardson credits nicaraguas supreme election council with 
maintaining an impartial and flexible attitude in interpreting 
election laws governing the campaign 
the sandinistas came to power in a july 1979 revolution that 
overthrew the somoza regime

items poland needs to whip food inflation 
include chemical pesticides that have been targeted by federal 
regulators and environmentalists agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said tuesday 
we need to do whatever we can to improve agricultural 
productivity in poland yeutter told the national press club 
interestingly there were two principle requests in this area 
the major requests were highprotein supplements for livestock 
feed and agricultural chemicals 
as we have experienced the situation here where folks are 
wanting to ban agricultural chemicals in the united states the no 
1 priority on the list in poland was agricultural chemicals he 
said 
but the aid package approved by congress doesnt include such 
chemicals 
theres little that we can do perhaps nothing that we can do 
in the way of agricultural chemicals from a governmental 
standpoint yeutter said adding that the private sector may have 
to meet polands request for farm chemicals through grants and 
donations 
yeutter recently led a presidential mission to poland to help 
determine what kind of aid is needed to help that country rebuild 
its agriculture

the five central american presidents 
demanded tuesday that the regions two major guerrilla armies be 
disbanded and asked for greater international involvement in the 
search for peace 
but skepticism surfaced quickly as to how effective the 
agreement would be i do not trust daniel ortega said 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
cristiani spoke hours after he nicaraguas ortega and the three 
other presidents signed a statement critical of el salvadors 
rebels nicaragua steadfastly supported the leftist rebels in the 
past 
the presidents implicitly chided the united states the soviet 
union and cuba by asking that nations with interests in the 
region get more directly involved in the peace process they also 
requested increased un involvement in the effort to demobilize 
irregular forces 
the twoday summit was the latest in a series that often raised 
hopes but failed to bring peace to central america presidents 
ortega cristiani jose azcona hoyo of honduras vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala and host oscar arias of costa rica attended 
the joint condemnation of guerrillas was viewed as a victory for 
cristiani and ortega but skeptics noted once again that neither of 
the rebel armies concerned nicaraguas usbacked contras and el 
salvadors leftist farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln was represented 
this continues to be the problem with all central american 
accords said luis sanchez sancho of the national opposition 
union a coalition that opposes nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government in elections set for feb 25 
the fmln cant be demobilized by an agreement among 
governments because it is legitimate force with popular support 
throughout el salvador the salvadoran rebels said in a statement 
a contras spokesman said they would not lay down arms until they 
could be certain that ortegas promises of democratization and 
tolerance were real 
the presidents talked only about hypothetical situations that 
dont correspond to reality luis frey known as commander 
johnson added in an interview with the the associated press in 
tegucigalpa honduras 
the presidents appeared to concede with their calls for 
increased involvement by other nations and by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that they cannot bring 
peace to the region by themselves 
the united states still supports the contras with nonlethal aid 
and wants them to remain a force at least until the february 
elections 
the soviet union has reportedly scolded cuba and nicaragua for 
shipping antiaircraft weapons to the fmln 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of 
the pact were certainly skeptical we remain to be convinced 
he said evidence exists that nicaragua is not willing to live up 
to its commitments about democratic reforms but fitzwater termed 
encouraging nicaraguas agreement not to support salvadoran 
rebels 
cristiani told a news conference after returning home that 
ortegas record made un involvement all the more important 
the more he violates agreements such as these the more his 
own image will deteriorate rapidly cristiani said 
for his part ortega asked the united states to support and 
respect this accord and to halt its sabotage 
the presidents called before for demobilization of the contras 
but tuesday was the first time they made a parallel call for 
demobilization of the fmln 
the five energetically demanded that the salvadoran rebels 
renounce all violence that directly or indirectly affects the 
civilian population a reference to last months urban offensive 
that embarrassed the rightwing salvadoran government and left more 
than 1000 dead 
the rebels reacted quickly saying the declaration failed to 
recognize the cristiani government had bombed civilians and 
assassinated and persecuted the religious community a 
reference in part to the unsolved murders of six jesuit priests 
last month 
the agreement was seen as a slap in the face for the fmln 
because it was signed by ortega their ally and supporter rebel 
spokesman antonio hernandez refused comment when asked in mexico 
city if ortega had sold them out 
it has to be seen in the context of the summit he said 
the rebel statement said the accord helped the salvadoran 
government in exchange for a new promise to immediately 
demobilize the nicaraguan contras 
the presidents asked un help to cut off arms supplies to rebel 
forces but omitted direct reference to nicaragua despite the recent 
discovery of two planes and a truck smuggling arms into el salvador 
the declaration also made no reference to increasing election 
violence in nicaragua that threatens to jeopardize the free and 
democratic vote promised by the sandinistas for february 
those elections were called in exchange for an august agreement 
to disband the contras by dec 5 the new agreement offers the 
contras a chance to participate in elections if they repatriate 
themselves by feb 5

thousands of people who work for small 
companies are being cheated of insurance coverage by bogus plans 
sanctioned under federal law but living in a regulatory nevernever 
land witnesses told a house subcommittee tuesday 
both employers and employees are victims of the operators of the 
plans formally known as multiple employer welfare arrangements 
or less formally as health insurance arrangements the labor 
departments acting inspector general raymond maria testified 
within the benefit plan arena we are experiencing what i would 
describe as a proliferation of multiple employer welfare 
arrangements known by many names but i call them fraudulent 
trusts he said 
maria told the government operations committees subcommittee on 
legislation and national security that the plans were permitted to 
fill the vacuum left by the refusal of large insurance companies to 
provide coverage for small employers 
this vacuum is being filled by a number of fraudulent 
trusts he said in one state alone 3000 participants have 
become victims of fraud and are being held personally liable for 
more than 3 million in medical costs he said 
about 5 million such trusts exist he said the operators of the 
fraudulent ones sell their premiums at 20 percent to 50 percent 
below the rates offered by legitimate operators and the proceeds 
are embezzled often through the payment to a backup insurer that 
is really a shell company on a caribbean island he said 
these operations are not licensed by state insurance regulators 
who have reserve requirements and the outlaw plans do not maintain 
reserves to pay claims the operations run a typical pyramid game 
in which claims are drawn out and lawyers are changed he said 
when the state tries to crack down on the operators they claim 
that the federal government has jurisdiction said maria and 
patricia donovan petersen deputy insurance commissioner for 
washington state 
ms petersen told the subcommittee that she was constantly 
frustrated in her efforts to get federal help even with 
information in her 1988 investigation of two operators she said 
there wasnt even a list of companies 
one ran programs known as the western business association 
western timber association and western alliance of agriculture and 
one ran a program known as the northwest loggers association 
she said she was shuttled between the seattle office of 
inspector general and the office of pension welfare benefit 
administration until she finally gave up and used what state court 
action she could 
by then however the operator of northwest loggers had left the 
state with the program funds and hundreds of consumers in some 
six states with thousands probably hundreds of thousands of 
dollars of unpaid medical claims and with no medical coverage 
to date i know of no criminal civil or other disciplinary 
action taken or planned by any division of the labor department or 
any other entity she said adding that the operator gary n 
stone has settled in nevada and is setting up another plan 
unpaid medical claims for the other companies total at least 
100000 
this state has literally hundreds of these hias currently 
providing coverage to thousands of state residents she said 
without adequate regulation we can be certain that many more 
consumers will be injured

greenpeace antinuclear activists 
their ship damaged by the navy during a protest last week of a 
trident 2 missile launch said tuesday they will observe an 
upcoming launch but will not try to stop it 
our intention is not to physically obstruct the upcoming 
trident test but to exercise our rights to protest in 
international waters said shannon fagan a greenpeace 
spokeswoman 
she said a 60footketch the mondeivitano would sail to the 
vicinity of the test site later this week and will maintain the 
same distance from the site as other navy vessels 
the trident submarine launch area is in the atlantic 50 miles 
off cape canaveral during a test launch the navy declares a 
5000yard radius safety zone around the sub 
last week the 190foot mv greenpeace with 25 protesters on 
board penetrated the safety zone and dispatched two motorized rafts 
in an effort to halt a launch from the submerged submarine uss 
tennessee 
that tactic was successful in july but last week the navy was 
ready a submarine support ship bumped the greenpeace several times 
and used fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks to stop the 
engines small navy boats corraled the rafts cut fuel lines and 
towed them out of the danger zone 
the tennessee then successfully launched the trident 2 the 
navys newest most powerful nuclear weapon 
in washington the federal aviation administration said it is 
investigating another aspect of the dec 4 incident in which 
greenpeace operated a helicopter inside the launch area 
faa administrator james busey said that flight raises the 
serious issue of whether the pilot intentionally violated federal 
aviation regulations and said his agency is investigating a 
violation by a usregistered aircraft could result in the pilots 
losing his flight certificate the faa said 
navy officials would not say what precautions were being made 
for the upcoming launch in case protesters again tried to stop it 
the mv greenpeace suffered one threefoot gash and two smaller 
ones in its hull and will be tied up in drydock for repairs for 
several weeks fagan said 
they may have dented our ship but not our resolve fagan 
said she said the navy overreacted and deliberately rammed the 
greenpeace 
the issue is not greenpeace versus the navy she said we 
are however against nuclear weapons 
she said greenpeace also will stage waterbased and landbased 
protest vigils near port canaveral where the tennessee currently is 
based

soldiers destroyed airstrips used by 
drug runners tuesday and the traffickers appeared to be losing a 
campaign to get a national referendum on extradition to the united 
states news reports said 
a peace treaty with a colombian guerrilla group also probably 
will be lost because it is part of a bill to which the referendum 
proposal is attached 
security forces blew up 18 clandestine airstrips tuesday in 
northern colombia the televised midday news program reported 
quoting military sources 
the government has said it would continue its crackdown on the 
drug trade despite three months of violence by traffickers 
officials blame the drug barons for the bombing if a colombian 
jetliner nov 27 that killed all 107 people aboard and a bomb last 
monday that killed 63 and wounded more than 1000 in bogota 
earlier this month a proposed referendum on extradition was 
attached to legislation that would amend the constitution and 
includes provisions for election of former guerrillas to congress 
that measure part of a treaty negotiated last year by the 
government of president virgilio barco and the april 19 movement 
known as m19 would allow pardons for guerrillas and permit former 
rebels to form a political party 
a senate committee had the legislation tuesday but was 
reluctant to take it to the entire senate the 20 committee members 
were not talking about the bill and no one suggested it should 
even come to a vote the bogota dailies el tiempo and el espectador 
reported 
if the legislation is not approved by the senate by the time 
congress adjourns friday it could die 
changes contained in the bill would assure former guerrillas six 
seats in the 119member house and six in the 104 member senate 
members now are elected from a specific district and need about 
20000 votes to win former guerrillas would need a minimum of 
4000 votes which could come from throughout the country 
under other constitutional changes prosecutors and not 
magistrates would investigate criminal cases and the country would 
have a vice president someone now is designated to take over if 
the president dies but he has no regular role in government 
the bill sets a national referendum on the constitutional 
changes for jan 21 
it was approved by the house of representatives with the 
extradition rider by a vote of 1094 causing accusations in the 
press of bribes and bullying by the cocaine lords 
a statement from the traffickers who call themselves the 
extraditables said would not relent in their campaign of bombing 
and assassination until a referendum on extradition was held

president kenneth kaunda of zambia said 
tuesday that the international community should give south africa 
six months to abolish apartheid before clamping total economic 
sanctions on the pretoria government 
kaunda told reporters that when he met recently with president 
fw de klerk of south africa he said he was against apartheid 
he said he was going to work to remove it 
whether he will succeed i do not know we want to see if he 
is going to push his parliament to abolish apartheid if he does 
not then the security council should invoke mandatory sanctions 
kaunda and zimbabwes president robert mugabe gave keynote 
addresses at tuesdays opening of the general assemblys first 
special session on apartheid 
the united states or britain has always used its veto power to 
prevent the security council from imposing mandatory sanctions on 
south africa except for a 1977 ban on arms trade with that country 
they contend economic sanctions harm the black majority there 
more than the white minority and that the international community 
can better influence pretoria if it does not isolate the country 
black african nations and the african national congress the 
main guerrilla group fighting to end white domination in south 
africa demand comprehensive sanctions 
a general assembly call for all nations to sever economic 
military sports and cultural links with south africa has met with 
partial success 
south africa usually seems to find ways to obtain petroleum and 
other vital resources though at higher than market cost 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the opening 
session the assemblys longstanding opposition to apartheid is 
squarely based on the universally shared perception that the 
institution of apartheid constitutes a threat to international 
peace and security 
south africas seats in the assembly were vacant throughout the 
debate 
the general assembly in 1974 suspended south africas 
participation and voting in the assembly because it refused to obey 
the world bodys calls to abolish apartheid 
south african apartheid has established a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

community activists from across the nation 
tuesday swapped experiences and strategies from their often 
isolated wars on narcotics at a conference dedicated to creating 
drugfree neighborhoods in the 1990s 
the threeday conference ending wednesday includes workshops on 
substance abuse and prevention drugs in schools and antidrug 
legislation 
more important for some of the estimated 500 people in 
attendance it was an opportunity for encouragement and frank talk 
about the challenges of battling an epidemic 
the purpose is to indicate that no one in any state in any 
city in any municipality is working on this problem by 
themselves said the rev joseph kakalec a philadelphia 
activist to encourage each other to go back to the communities 
and take back the neighborhoods 
jaci feldman director of drug programs for the national 
training and information center said she hopes activists will 
return to their communities with new tactics for the grassroots 
drug war 
those attending the conference sponsored by the chicagobased 
center also worked on model legislation that among other things 
would require a percentage of money seized from drug dealers be 
returned to community organizations 
elsewhere national drug czar william bennett made rock n roll 
the medium of his antidrug message tuesday when he jammed on an 
electric guitar for about 200 twisting and shouting junior high 
students in manchester nh 
this combines two very interesting aspects of society the 
principle of law and the principle of rock n roll bennett told 
the students as he joined a manchester police department rock band 
that carries an antidrug message to schools 
bennett made sure the seventh and eighth graders from st joseph 
regional jr high school would remember him when he picked up the 
rhythm guitar for a version of twist and shout with the band 
friends in blue 
at an earlier appearance in concord nh bennett said he 
approved taking custody away from addicted parents in extreme cases 
obviously you give parents you give anybody the chance to 
recover to get better bennett said in an interview but 
supposing the parent isnt getting better shows no interest in 
improving going into treatment and its adversely and dramatically 
affecting the wellbeing of the child the state can intervene 
at the chicago meeting groups new at fighting narcotics dealing 
and veteran organizations discussed their problems and victories 
donna jones leader of a fledgling antidrug group in waterloo 
iowa talked with herman wrice a drexel university professor who 
with several others began marching on crack houses in philadelphia 
two years ago 
mrs jones group held their first antidrug march a week ago 
with about 100 people wrice began attacking crack houses with a 
sledgehammer and a handful of supporters and now has a coalition 
that involves at least 60 organizations who walk druginfested 
neighborhoods each week 
it will take the involvement of community residents not police 
or the courts to rid the neighborhoods of drugs wrice said 
you can stay inside your home and pretend how dangerous it is 
and theyll drug dealers come to your house and take you on he 
said 
the national training and information center has previously 
worked with organizations on issues including housing utilities 
and health care 
last spring the nonprofit center began administering a 
federally funded program in nine cities to develop community 
strategies for battling drugs representatives from each group 
attended the conference to discuss their progress 
ms feldman said community residents were ignored for too long 
in the drug war 
they are the eyes and ears of their community they know 
whats going on in their community she said 
but increasingly authorities are encouraging the involvement of 
community activists and the involvement is growing ms feldman 
said 
what ive been hearing the last two days is im tired of 
feeling like a prisoner in my own home i have to get out of my 
house and do something she said

federal prosecutors have expanded 
their investigation into allegations that west german companies 
helped libya build a chemical weapons plant outside tripoli an 
official said tuesday 
peter wechsung of the federal prosecutors office in mannheim 
said criminal probes were opened against three highlevel employees 
of salzgitter industriebau ag 
he told the associated press that andreas boehm salzgitters 
project manager for what libya describes as a civilian 
pharmaceutical plant is suspected of violating west german laws 
forbidding export of materials that can be used for chemical 
weapons 
formal probes were opened against two other employees suspected 
of giving false testimony to investigators 
wechsung said prosecutors are proceeding from the assumption 
that the plant was designed for making chemical weapons he said it 
was hardly conceivable no one among about 100 people involved 
in the project at salzgitter knew the plants real function 
the united states said last year that the plant in the libyan 
desert at rabta about 60 miles from tripoli was intended to 
produce poison gas 
west german investigations of the imhausen chemie company based 
at lahr in the black forest led to charges against company 
president juergen hippenstielimhausen washington said the firm 
masterminded the project 
salzgitter was mentioned as one of the companies providing 
materials for the libyan project

president bush signed a bill tuesday inspired 
by the irancontra affair to tighten restrictions on the sale of 
military arms and equipment to nations deemed responsible for 
international terrorism 
working on a stack of legislation left by congress before it 
left town bush also signed a bill to require all schools receiving 
federal aid to adopt programs designed to prevent the use of 
illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students 
i believe these provisions will assist significantly our 
struggle to rid our nations schools of drug and alcohol abuse and 
educate our young to the legal social and health consequences of 
such abuse bush said in a statement 
in addition he signed a measure that authorizes spending 127 
million over four years to hire 700 new police officers in the 
district of colombia which has one of the nations highest 
homicide rates 
in signing the bill restricting foreign arms sales bush said 
i wish to reemphasize this nations strong determination to 
oppose international terrorists and the states that support them 
curbing state support to terrorists is essential in reducing 
the menace of international terrorism bush said 
federal law bans the export of military arms to countries found 
guilty of international terrorism a designation the united states 
applies to libya iran syria south yemen cuba and north korea 
in 1986 the law was amended to authorize a waiver of the ban if 
the president makes a determination that such action is in the 
national interest and so notifies congress 
by late 1985 however the united states already had started 
secretly shipping arms to iran through israel in what was judged to 
be an attempt to win the release of american hostages held in 
lebanon in january 1986 thenpresident reagan secretly authorized 
the sale of us weapons to iran 
congress was not notified of the shipments until nov 25 1986 
when the white house announced that arms had been sold to iran and 
that the profits had been diverted to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
the new restrictions on arms sales intended to close loopholes 
in the law require the president to report and consult with 
congress before the actual export of military goods to terrorist 
countries 
in signing the measure bush said he would interpret the law 
as placing no limit on our negotiations and communications with 
foreign governments

president bush signed legislation tuesday 
banning the import of undersized lobsters 
the bill was backed by new england lawmakers who presented it 
both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect us 
fishermen against canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters 
the lobster provision is contained in the 400 million 
authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen 
william s cohen rmaine first sponsored the provision after 
maine fishermen complained about canadian competition 
fishermen argue that canadas smaller minimum legal size of 
lobsters has allowed canadian fishermen to catch and sell smaller 
cheaper lobsters in us markets 
the legislation signed by bush would place a market representing 
roughly half of candadas lobster exports off limits for the sale 
of short lobsters 
the current minimum legal size in the united states is 3 inches 
from the eye socket to the edge of the back where the tail begins 
the canadian minimum is onesixteenth of an inch smaller 
up to now us law has not regulated the size of imported 
lobsters 
in coming years us regulations would gradually increase the 
minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in us waters 
because canada would not be bound by the increased minimum size 
regulation its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and 
compete unfairly with their us counterparts lobster fishermen 
argued

attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said 
rafael caro quintero 37 and ernesto rafael fonesca carrillo 
56 were found guilty of masterminding the killings of camarena an 
agent of the us drug enforcement administration and his mexican 
pilot alvarez said 
they were tried earlier this year but convictions and sentences 
are announced simultaneously in mexico 
time for related convictions of kidnapping drug trafficking and 
weapons smuggling brought caro quinteros total sentence to 116 
years and fonsecas to 144 the sentences are to be served 
concurrently 
fernando arias a spokesman for alvarez said caro quintero and 
fonseca would have to serve 74 and 53 years respectively because of 
nonconcurrent time remaining from previous sentences 
he said there is no parole in drugrelated cases not even by 
a single day 
don hamilton spokesman for us drug control policy director 
william j bennett said in washington its certainly nice to 
see people like caro quintero off the streets i think the united 
states and mexico will both be the better for it 
ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for 
taking part in the killings and 13 other men received lesser 
sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by caro 
quintero and fonseca 
all property and possessions of the two are being confiscated as 
part of the penalty alvarez said he had no figures for their 
holdings but said the list is very long 
both are known to have millions of dollars in assets including 
ranches aircraft luxury cars houses apartments hotels and 
businesses 
tuesdays sentences were handed down by judge tomas hernandez 
franco of the 4th criminal court in guadalajara where camarena was 
based it is the capital of jalisco state 350 miles west of mexico 
city and a major center for the drug traffickers 
alvarez the attorney general was governor of jalisco at the 
time of the camarena killing 
the slayings of camarena who was based in guadalajara and 
pilot alfredo zavala avelar and the subsequent investigation 
strained relations between mexico and the united states 
us officials said mexican authorities allowed caro quintero to 
escape to costa rica where he finally was captured in an effort 
to pressure the mexican government for action us customs 
virtually blocked the border by conducting full searches of all 
mexicans trying to enter the united states 
president carlos salinas de gortari who took office a year has 
made vigorous efforts to change mexicos image as a haven for drug 
dealers and corruption by jailing traffickers and arresting corrupt 
officials 
caro quintero worked with colombias cocaine cartels to smuggle 
drugs to the united states through mexico his story and the 
camarena killing were the subject of a book and television movie in 
the united states both called desperados 
he was sentenced to 34 years in another drug case earlier this 
year and fonseca was given 13 years arias said those will run 
consecutively with the camarena sentences 
it was revealed in july that caro quintero and fonseca had 
bribed mexico city prison officials to allow them to live in luxury 
accomodations they had built inside the prison 
camarena was kidnapped feb 7 1985 in guadalajara and zavala 
avelar a few days later their bulletriddled bodies showing signs 
of torture were found march 5 on a ranch 60 miles southeast of 
guadalajara 
the bodies wrapped in plastic bags had been buried in shallow 
graves 
in a related case ruben zuno arce 59 was arraigned monday in 
a los angeles court on charges of conspiracy in the camarena 
killing 
zuno arce a brotherinlaw of former president luis echeverria 
is among 13 people in the united states charged in connection with 
the drug agents death 
alvarez said the mexican government had no evidence against zuno 
arce and there was no connection to tuesdays sentencing

a sixman international ski and sled dog 
team trying to make the first unmechanized crossing of antarctica 
settled in tuesday at the south pole the halfway point in their 
grueling journey 
the expedition reached the us scottamundsen scientific 
research base monday afternoon said jack renirie chief spokesman 
for the national science foundation in washington dc the 
foundation an independent federal agency runs the research base 
as part of the us antarctica program he said 
renirie noting that it is government policy not to support 
private expeditions said he had been in contact with scientists at 
the base who confirmed the international transantarctica 
expedition was there 
team members planned to remain at the pole camped in tents 
outside the base station until friday said jennifer kimball 
gasperini spokeswoman for the group at its st paulbased 
headquarters 
their time is well consumed by personal management taking 
care of their gear sewing clothing drying clothing working on 
their sleds and probably running the dogs a little bit each day to 
keep them in condition kimball gasperini said tuesday 
she said the group also plans to meet with film crews from 
france that have been documenting the trek 
after arriving at the south pole the group sent a misspelled 
satellite message that read here we are horrah 
the expedition led by minnesotan will steger and jeanlouis 
etienne of france is the first to reach the bottom of the world by 
dogsled since roald amundsen first did so on dec 14 1911 steger 
45 made history three years ago when he led a similar assault on 
the north pole 
the adventurers already have traveled 1992 miles from the tip 
of the antarctic peninsula where the trek began july 27 
the goal of the 4000mile trek is to reach mirnyy a soviet 
science station on the continents indian ocean shore which is 
1600 miles and three months farther to the east 
to get there the troupe must cross the area of inaccessibility 
a 850mile void of ice where neither radio nor airplane contact is 
guaranteed

newly elected politburo member alexander 
lilov told a major communist assembly on tuesday the most 
important question to ask is why the system breeds dictators and 
why it tolerates them for so long 
his surprising comments came as he and others denounced the 
demoted party leadership at a key session of the bulgarian 
communist partys policysetting central committee new personal 
attacks were made against disgraced longtime leader todor zhivkov 
as thousands rallied for further reforms 
about 20000 bulgarians stood in a candlelight vigil in the 
plaza outside making clear they would keep up pressure for fast 
and effective political change despite new party chief petar 
mladenovs promises of reform 
mladenov proposed on monday opening day of the closeddoor 
meeting that the party give up its guaranteed monopoly on power 
and talk with independent groups he also proposed free elections 
by may 1990 
the developments came a month after zhivkov was ousted after a 
35year regime mladenov formerly foreign minister took office 
when zhivkov and his stalinist old guard were forced out nov 10 
georgi grigorov newly elected first secretary of the sofia city 
committee told tuesdays meeting the party was beheaded in terms 
of personnel in desperate need of competent economic managers 
and ideologists 
lilov voted into the ruling politburo on friday after zhivkov 
kept him away from the power center for years said zhivkovs 
legacy was a degradation of party principles and ethnics the 
state news agency bta reported 
he renewed calls for punishment of zhivkov and his closest 
associates 
the culprits for this crisis should be named and held 
politically and in some cases criminally liable bta quoted 
lilov as saying meaning they should be tried in court 
premier georgi atanasov echoed mladenov who on monday gave a 
grim account of bulgarias crisisridden economy bulgaria with a 
population of 89 million is saddled with an overall western debt 
of about 10 billion 
we can hardly point to a subbranch and even a single 
production which is competitive on the free international 
markets said atanasov who took over as prime minister in 1986 
the candlelight vigil was the third such quiet demonstration in 
two days 
some put their candles on window ledges of the central committee 
headquarters because its right under their noses two young 
men explained a guard soon came blew out the candles and threw 
them away 
one demonstrator declared its right under their temple 
lets hope sooner or later we are going to bring that temple down 
earlier tuesday 3000 assembled in the plaza for a daylight 
vigil 
deyan kiuranov a spokesman for the influential environmental 
group ecoglasnost said tuesday the party regained some face 
through mladenovs speech on monday ecoglasnost became the first 
officially registered independent group in bulgaria 
kiurianov told western reporters he thought independent groups 
would accept mladenovs offer of immediate dialogue 
at a rally on sunday more than 50000 people cheered calls for 
the entire central committee to resign 
independent groups that sponsored the demonstration have called 
for round table talks with the communist leadership like those 
held in poland last spring and east germany this month 
kiuranov also is active in the new union of democratic forces 
alliance of 10 independent groups and said it would play a very 
active political role in the elections mladenov proposed 
he conceded little time remained for the opposition to organize 
but predicted early elections would act as a unifying force for 
his alliance 
some people questioned in the street were skeptical of 
mladenovs ability to separate himself from the zhivkov regime 
where he spent 18 years as foreign minister 
i could trust mladenov if he gained the peoples trust said 
a housepainter who would not give his name if the new leader 
doesnt get rid of those around him the people wont trust 
him he said 
many people conditioned by the distrust and fear of two 
generations refused to speak 
mladnov proposed monday that a special party congress be held 
march 26 and the current term of the entire party leadership end at 
that time which would be tantamount to collective resignation 
kiuranov described that as a halfway step to meeting 
opposition demands but also a halfway step to counter them 
since taking office mladenov has reorganized the partys ruling 
politburo twice to remove hardliners who served under zhivkov

murder and torture continue in the war zones of 
sudan despite the change of governments amnesty international said 
in a report released tuesday 
the human rights group said soldiers killed 34 civilian 
detainees in the southern garrison town of wau on july 19 three 
weeks after the military took power in a coup 
it is believed that the armed forces have done nothing to 
punish those responsible for these unlawful killings the report 
said the military governments apparent lack of response to the 
killings in wau and its continuing detention of political opponents 
in the north of sudan is a cause for grave human rights concern 
londonbased amnesty international said prisoners held by the 
military have been tortured to force confessions 
a wellreported instance of cruel tying on 10 march 1989 in 
the south kordofan town of meiram caused the death of one man and 
led to the eventual amputation of the arms of two others the 
report said similar cases are known from the towns of delami 
addamazin chali and juba 
it said there were reports of some victims having their wrists 
and elbows tied behind their backs and others had their ankles 
bound to their wrists and then left face down 
gross abuses also have been carried out by militias supplied and 
supported by the armed forces and successive sudanese governments 
according to the report it said some of the most serious abuses 
have involved militias formed among the nomadic rizeiqat and 
misseriya peoples of south darfur and south kordofan 
successive administrations including the current military 
government have failed to act forthrightly against deliberate 
killings and torture in and around areas of armed conflict the 
report said 
since the outbreak of war in 1983 there have been few official 
investigations into human rights violations and as far as amnesty 
international is aware no prosecutions for unlawful killings or 
torture this amounts to a willful failure by the sudan government 
to protect basic human rights 
the organization said human rights also are violated by the 
rebels sudan peoples liberation army 
the spla has extrajudicially executed prisoners such as 
government troops and militia captured in combat suspected 
government informers and civilians thought to be opposed to the 
spla the report said it is believed that some hundreds of 
captured government troops were killed in bor in march 1989 there 
are also reports of extrajudicial executions of civilians by the 
spla in south kordofan and equatoria

secretary of state gentry crowell whose 
office has been near the center of a federal probe into illegal 
bingo gambling and public corruption was shot in the head tuesday 
in an apparent suicide attempt 
doctors removed damaged brain tissue and the bullet lodged in 
his skull during more than four hours of emergency surgery tuesday 
at vanderbilt university medical center crowell was listed in very 
critical condition 
the path that the bullet took is not one that would kill 
one said dr joseph c ross vice chancellor for health affairs 
at vanderbilt university medical center 
crowell was found by a son brooks about 645 am on the porch 
of his home in lebanon about 30 miles east of nashville police 
said crowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a 
38caliber revolver found next to his hand he did not leave a 
note and police declined to speculate on any reason 
he had a gunshot wound with the bullet actually going up into 
the brain there was a lot of bleeding and it destroyed a lot of 
tissue ross said its impossible to know at this time what 
residual damage there might be 
he said doctors are trying to reduce swelling around crowells 
brain and prevent infection 
several democratic legislators were waiting outside the 
hospitals neurological intensive care unit where crowell was 
taken after surgery 
the reaction to tuesdays shooting was one of shock on capitol 
hill 
its just terrible a tragedy like this gov ned mcwherter 
said its just unbelievable to me 
mcwherter a former house speaker and crowell were close 
politically when crowells partisan chairing of the house calendar 
committee earned him the name the godfather 
lt gov john s wilder near tears declined to comment 
sen robert rochelle a democrat from crowells home town of 
lebanon called crowell a private person who does not talk about 
things he doesnt talk about his problems 
depression is a terrible thing i didnt realize that gentry 
had anything bothering him to that extent said house speaker ed 
murray 
crowells wife terrijean and son brooks were the only family 
members at home when the shooting happened police said brooks 
crowell heard a shot and found his father outside the couple also 
have two other children 
tennessee bureau of investigation agents are probing the 
shooting to make sure foul play was not involved said tbi deputy 
director john carney 
crowell 57 was elected secretary of state by the legislature 
in 1977 after serving four terms in the state house 
crowell has testified twice before grand juries investigating 
illegal bingo gambling and public corruption including last month 
in memphis he said then he had been assured by federal 
investigators they were not seeking an indictment against him 
crowell has not been implicated in the probe but one of his 
former employees is serving a prison term in connection with it 
another was named as an unindicted coconspirator in connection 
with the operation of a memphis bingo hall 
twentytwo people have been indicted or pleaded guilty this year 
in the investigation 
bingo had been legal for charity purposes but reports showed 
that fake charities often were set up to run the games and money 
was siphoned off illegally 
all permits for the game were revoked this year after the 
tennessee supreme court ruled that it was a lottery in violation 
of the state constitution 
under tennessee law the governor can appoint an interim 
replacement for crowell or wait for the legislature to do so when 
it convenes next month 
david welles mcwherters legal counsel said the governor would 
probably wait for the legislature to act the office will be run in 
the meantime by crowells executive assistant

a house panel began an investigation tuesday 
of apparently contradictory methods used by the nuclear 
regulatory commission in deciding whether to allow the seabrook 
nuclear plant to open 
rep peter kostmeyer dpa chairman of the house interior 
committee oversight and investigations subcommittee demanded 
answers from nrc chairman kenneth carr on nrc procedure 
this inquiry has been prompted by the steady erosion of safety 
standards enacted by congress following the major nuclear accident 
at three mile island in pennsylvania and by the extraordinary 
series of apparently contradictory actions recently taken by the 
commission and its licensing board concerning the application for a 
fullpower operating license at seabrook station in new 
hampshire kostmeyer said in a letter to carr 
nrc spokesman frank ingram said the letter had not been 
received but would be responded to promptly 
the commission is following its usual license procedures on 
seabrook ingram said 
legislators from around new england called for the investigation 
last month after the nrcs atomic safety and licensing board 
recommended that seabrook should be awarded a license 
kostmeyer cited a recent dispute in which the licensing board 
downplayed concerns raised by the nrcs higher level atomic safety 
and licensing appeal board about the adequacy of new hampshire 
evacuation plans 
it is apparent that the commission is dangerously close to 
twisting the intent of congress to a point where it can no longer 
be said that the public health and safety protection afforded by 
one emergency plan is equivalent to another kostmeyer wrote 
kostmeyer was particularly concerned that the licensing board 
issued a final decision on massachusetts evacuation plans only two 
days after the appeal board raised its concerns about the new 
hampshire plans 
the letter to carr included 11 questions about nrc procedure and 
requested answers no later than dec 20 among other things 
kostmeyer asked whether the geographic location of a plant and the 
relative difficulty of evacuating residents from that area was 
relevant in licensing a plant 
mike connolly an aide to us rep edward markey dmass said 
there was no immediate word on how soon the oversight committee 
would begin hearings 
in a related development the licensing board dismissed a 
complaint tuesday about the adequacy of an emergency drill at the 
seabrook plant and said the massachusetts attorney general filed 
his concerns too late 
ron sher spokesman for new hampshire yankee electric co the 
operater of the plant for the multicompany owning consortium 
said seabrook station has been the most closely scrutinized 
nuclear plant ever licenses and the in the 18year licensing 
history of seabrook intervenors have had ample opportunity to make 
their case 
sher said experts had found the emergency plan one of the best 
in the country

old guard communists lost their 
last important jobs tuesday and the argument over whether vaclav 
havel will crown the peaceful revolution by becoming president 
moved into parliament 
the presidential contest is the last round for an opposition 
that transformed czechoslovakia in three weeks from a rigid 
communist state to a society in which the party is giving up power 
for the first time in 41 years 
central prague was plastered with posters for havel an 
oftenjailed playwright whose works were banned until the 
revolution began about 500 people stood outside parliament 
shouting his name as deputies entered 
parliament has until dec 23 to elect a president under the 
constitution but some legislators want the choice to be made in a 
referendum of all citizens 
after discussions by constitutional lawyers from all parties 
politburo member vasil mohorita said it might take up to 60 days 
for an election to be held whether in parliament or by referendum 
he said havel who leads the civic forum opposition group 
represents something and in no way can we underestimate his 
position in society 
mohorita said the opposition agreed 14 days was too little time 
for electing a president and what we are trying to find is the 
least complicated agreement civic forum said it opposes a 
referendum 
the new president will succeed gustav husak 76 who resigned 
sunday after swearing in a coalition government intended to 
overturn his hardline policies and arrange free elections 
mohorita represented the party in negotiations for the coalition 
several members of the new government were jailed or forced to 
take lowly jobs when husak became communist party chief after a 
sovietled invasion ended the prague spring of reform in 1968 
other remaining hardliners were swept out tuesday forced to 
resign from the presidium that guides parliament the 15 who 
stepped down include ousted party chief milos jakes who was 
expelled from party last week and vasil bilak the man held most 
responsible for the invasion they remain as deputies 
anton blazej a deputy speaking for the communists who dominate 
the 350seat parliament proposed tuesday that the constitution be 
amended to allow a citizen referendum for president to be held 
within a month 
his suggestion was applauded loudly in the televised session he 
could not muster enough support to pass the necessary 
constitutional amendments by acclamation however and acting 
speaker bohuslav kucera said draft laws must be submitted 
a deputy who did not identify himself spoke in favor of havels 
candidacy and earned warm applause from the crowded visitors 
gallery 
civic forum which havel guided through the period of crisis and 
change said a referendum might seem enticingly democratic but 
a presidential campaign could leave czechoslovakia more divided 
than united 
a civic forum statement said the president should be elected by 
parliament as in the past while the government presses on with 
plans for free elections 
lubos dobrovsky a spokesman read the statement to reporters 
then said in response to a question we are not concerned with 
whether havel would have a better chance of election in 
parliament than in a referendum we are concerned with democracy 
having a better chance 
last week civic forum indicated virtual agreement among parties 
that the president should be a czech noncommunist because the new 
premier is marian calfa a communist from slovakia the tradition 
is for a czech to hold one of the top jobs and a slovak the other 
havel is a controversial choice for communists who were 
denouncing him only a month ago 
alexander dubcek a 68yearold slovak who led the 1968 reforms 
as party chief also is a candidate for president and got the 
support tuesday of the slovak national council slovakias regional 
parliament 
other candidates are ladislav adamec the communist premier who 
resigned last week and cestmir cisar a prague spring leader 
who was expelled from the party with dubcek in 1970 
calfa said sunday a czech premier could be found if the 
president was a slovak 
although the communists are wary of havel they know more unrest 
could result if he is not elected dobrovsky told reporters no 
decision had been made about organizing more protests or strikes if 
havel passed over 
bilak was charged monday with two unspecified counts connected 
with the 1968 crackdown the official news agency ctk gave no 
details but said he was believed in some quarters to have 
committed treason 
the 72yearold former party ideologist apparently cannot be 
tried because the crimes with which he is charged fall under a 
20year statute of limitations 
on tuesday bilak was attacked in the communist party daily of 
his native slovakia for bringing shame on the party by buying a 
villa for onetenth what the government had spent to renovate it 
jibes like that used to be aimed only at dissidents

were enshrined in the pantheon tuesday along with those of a 
philosopher and a mathematician in the last official event of 
frances bicentennial year 
president francois mitterrand attended the ceremony in the 
former left bank church where france honors its heros but the 
event was boycotted by french church leaders who feel the priest 
was something less than a hero

fight against slavery but he also proposed the abolition of the 
monarchy and backed a controversial oath to the state that the 
clergy were forced to take 
moved to the pantheon at the same time were jeanantoine 
caritat marquis de concorcet a friend of voltaire and other 
philosophers and gaspard monge inventor of descriptive geometry 
both were active in the french revolution 
pope john paul ii was represented by the papal nuncio lorenzo 
antonetti 
the french church has not forgotten the revolutions massacres 
of priests and desecration of churches 
the abbe gregoire defended a conception of the church which 
differs from the catholic tradition cardinal jeanmarie 
lustiger archbishop of paris said in a newspaper interview before 
the ceremony

illegal drugs from cocaine to heroin should be 
legalized taxed and dispensed by the state because the socalled 
war on drugs is failing a federal judge said tuesday 
i suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition to cease 
treating indulgence in mindalteration as a crime us district 
judge robert w sweet said in remarks to be delivered tuesday 
evening before the cosmopolitan club a social club for women and 
men 
the result would be the elimination of the profit motive the 
gangs the drug dealers sweet said obviously the model is 
the repeal of prohibition and the end of al capone and dutch 
schultz 
sweet a trial judge in the southern district of new york for 
more than 11 years was the first federal judge to propose publicly 
that illegal drugs be legalized according to the drug policy 
foundation 
the foundation an international nonprofit research group in 
washington is dedicated to finding alternatives to current drug 
policy 
sweet said the current effort to stem the drug epidemic by 
putting more people in jail is not working 
the war on drugs has failed to stop the traffic or to alter 
the social patterns which produce the phenomena he said it is 
expensive and diverting and has come close to causing foreign 
excursions subversions and has caused us to reconsider whether or 
not as a nation we wish to employ assassination as an expression of 
policy 
sweets remarks came a day after federal drug czar william j 
bennett made a speech charging that liberal intellectuals are 
betraying their concern for the poor by advancing morally 
scandalous arguments for repeal of drug laws 
sweet a former federal prosecutor and a deputy mayor under 
republican mayor john lindsay is part of a small but growing 
chorus of public figures advocating drug legalization or 
decriminalization 
despite bennetts contention they come from both the liberal 
and conservative ends of the political spectrum and include former 
secretary of state george p shultz baltimore mayor kurt schmoke 
economist milton friedman and political commentator william f 
buckley 
sweet said he believes the root cause of the drug epidemic is 
poverty and drug dealing will continue to attract some elements of 
the poor as long as the profit potential is so high 
perhaps we must ask not what can we do to eliminate drugs but 
what can we do to eliminate or at least reduce the level of 
poverty he said 
sweet proposed that pharmaceutical companies could manufacture 
the drugs the state would control prices and distribute them to 
addicts for less than they currently cost and that some of the tax 
revenue would be plowed back into research education and treatment 
of addiction 
distribution to minors should remain prohibited and users would 
be identified through their dna or fingerprints sweet said 
in a telephone interview monday sweet said he came to the 
conclusion that drugs should be legalized from his personal 
experience without any discussion among colleagues 
i just got into this because somebody asked me to make a 
speech and i decided i would make the speech and in order to make 
the speech i had to decide what i thought he said and thats 
what i thought i really havent been conducting a survey or 
anything like that

the naval group included the supply ship marne serving as

grandiere and the destroyer la boudeuse the french news agency 
said it quoted a french military spokesman in mayotte as saying 
the ships left there at 4 am 8 pm est wednesday 
mayotte is in the comoro chain but is administered by france 
the spokesman col philippe charrier did not reveal the 
mission of the military force 
afp quoted military sources in mayotte as saying the force would 
anchor about 45 miles off grande comore island site of the 
archipelagos capital moroni 
it was denard who installed abdallah in power in a 1978 coup 
and who has been a force in the comoros ever since 
the french news agency said france working with south africa 
has opened discreet negotiations with the french mercenary to 
obtain his departure 
denard hinted at a news conference tuesday night that he would 
leave the comoros saying he could not resist two superpowers 
referring to france and south africa he said abderrahmane was 
killed accidentally by his bodyguard a sgt jaffar 
the conservative newspaper le figaro reported tuesday that the 
60yearold denard said he and his men will be happy to leave the 
comoros if the price is right and the arrangements are honorable 
since the assassination justice said mohammed djohar of the 
supreme court has been acting president he has made no public 
appeal for french aid to drive out denard and his men

many of the 27 children and adults killed 
in a fiery bus crash could have survived if their seats had been 
fire resistant and the buss fuel tank had been improved defense 
witnesses testified tuesday 
safety issues dominated the 13th day of testimony in the murder 
and drunkendriving trial of larry mahoney driver of the pickup 
truck that collided headon with the church bus south of this ohio 
river town on may 14 1988 
eugene sober a fire safety engineer with the national 
aeronautics and space administration said the 1977 ford bus seat 
cushions and covers burn rapidly and emit toxic smoke that kill 
passengers within minutes 
thomas feaheny a former ford motor co vice president 
testified that existing technology could have prevented the fire 
but was not allowed to give any details 
feaheny also testified that a protective cage around the bus 
gasoline tank probably would not have prevented the blaze 
carroll circuit judge charles satterwhite has ruled that any 
information about technology that could have prevented the bus fire 
is inadmissable in the trial 
anytime there is evidence that has been excluded obviously it 
hurts us defense attorney russell baldani said in an afternoon 
press conference 
sobers testimony dealt with the deadly effects of flexible 
polyurethane foam the material in the cushions and 
polychlorinated vinyl the plastic seat covering 
flexible polyurethane foam is the single largest class of 
fuels involved with fatal fires sober said 
when burned untreated foam emits hydrogen cyanide gas and the 
plastic emits hydrogen chloride gas he said in addition the fire 
produces carbon monoxide gas forcing people to breathe harder and 
faster 
sober said the fire hazards of the material used for the seats 
were well known in the early 1970s 
foam treated with fire retardant was readily available to the 
automotive industry when the school bus later sold to the radcliff 
first assembly of god church as surplus was manufactured in 1977 
he said 
seats treated with fire retardant would have saved lives in the 
crash he said there would have certainly been a lot more time 
for them to escape sober said 
feaheny a 26year ford employee said the crash was the worst 
single tragedy i ever heard of in the industry and it could have 
been prevented 
he said a fire beneath the bus boiled gasoline in the metal fuel 
tank like a teakettle and squirted flaming gasoline into the 
bus like a flame thrower 
under crossexamination feaheny said that while he never had 
any direct involvement in the design and development of buses at 
ford his overall experience in the mechanical systems of trucks 
and cars provided him the basis to discuss the fuel tank safety of 
the 1977 ford bus 
feaheny fired in september 1983 had sued six ford executives 
for about 30 million in damages alleging they interfered with his 
career development a verdict in the suit went against feaheny in 
december 1986 and is on appeal 
baldani asked feaheny if he had an ax to grind with ford 
feaheny said he did not 
mahoneys defense is expected to conclude friday he is charged 
with 27 counts of murder 12 counts of assault 42 counts of wanton 
endangerment and a count of drunken driving

a federal appeals court ruling on the 
landmark brown vs board of education case said in a revised 
version of an earlier opinion that this city hasnt done enough to 
desegregate its schools 
in the ruling reached monday and released tuesday a threejudge 
panel of the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver reversed 
us district richard rogers decision in the case and sent it back 
to the lower court 
the original case led to a us supreme court ruling in 1954 
which set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and 
busing cases but black schoolchildrens parents sued 10 years ago 
to have the case reopened 
the 94page majority opinion a reworked version of a 21 
decision last june was accompanied by a new 154page dissenting 
opinion that said substantial integration had been achieved in 
topeka 
attorneys on both sides of the case were reluctant to comment on 
the decision because they had not seen it yet 
an attorney for the topeka school board joe zima said the 
board plans to hold an emergency meeting early next week to discuss 
the case and consider the next step 
in 1954 the supreme court ruled that segregated school systems 
were unconstitutional because separate facilities for blacks and 
whites provided inherently unequal educational opportunities 
the topeka school district which had set aside four elementary 
schools for blacks was ordered to put an integration plan into 
effect 
in 1979 the parents of 16 black schoolchildren sued saying the 
district had not yet eliminated all vestiges of segregation 
rogers ruled in 1987 that the schools were not responsible for 
lingering segregation because the board of education did not intend 
to keep them segregated 
in mondays majority decision judge stephanie seymour wrote 
that the schol district needed to do more to obtain integration 
she said that about onefourth of topekas minority elementary 
school pupils still attend three schools with more than 50 percent 
minority enrollments 
we simply see no evidence that topeka dedicated itself to 
desegregation prior to the reopening of this case seymour wrote 
seymour said rogers erred by limiting the district to having to 
show it acted as it did for nondiscriminatory reasons 
as 30 years of desegregation law have made clear the 
constitution requires more than ceasing to promote segregation 
she wrote 
the opinion was also signed by judge monroe mckay 
in his dissenting opinion judge bobby baldock argued the 
school board has demonstrated concern for improving the racial 
composition in the topeka schools while retaining the neighborhood 
school concept 
in some places the two are not compatible but in this system 
substantial integration has been achieved 
plaintiffs attorney rich jones said the dissenting opinion 
would be important because it would help the district decide what 
to do 
zima said the district could ask all 10 judges on the appeals 
court to hear the case ask the supreme court to hear the case or 
go before rogers to help fashion a remedy for the problems cited by 
the appellate court

the sudden attack of democracy in eastern europe 
probably has ruined things for spy novelists who may now have to 
come in from the cold war but the better ones still can make do 
exhibit a frederick forsyth and his just another secret 
its a tale he wrote as the basis for a twohour usa network movie 
that the cable network has on display tonight and again on sunday 
starring beau bridges as a cia agent sent to east germany after 
a fiveman cia cell there mysteriously vanishes its a crisp 
workmanlike exercise in spying amour double and tripleagenting 
blackmail and even betrayal 
in the script by murray smith our hero probing the mystery of 
the missing cell comes across a plot by hardline stalinists they 
intend to assassinate mikhail s gorbachev in east germany during a 
secret trip there by the soviet leader 
the united states of course will be blamed and as one british 
agent says it could send the cold war right back to the ice 
age or bridges snaps it could start a hot war 
the storys time forsyth explains in a preface is just 
before the gorbachevinspired reforms when the berlin wall really 
was impregnable and east germany was a hardline fortress under the 
heel of the secret police 
having asked you to forget current events which are no fun for 
espionage freaks anyway his show gets cracking immediately in the 
best twistandturn tradition with its fine predominantly british 
cast 
ace spy bridges of course is exhausted from a recent trip into 
murky beirut relaxing with his wife and kids at a barbeque at his 
suburban virginia home he tries to get out of the missingcell 
mission sure 
next stop east berlin he goes there disguised as a flutist in 
a west german chamber music ensemble swaps identities with a 
stagehand then has to kill a drunken cop lest he be exposed 
this touches off a hunt by an honest dogged police lieutenant 
kenneth cranham who thinks this only is a murder case 
with the cops in hot pursuit bridges meets a lovely woman 
beatie edney an artistwaitress who gives him a place to stay 
she readily too readily cynics might say believes his tale 
that hes a musician down on his luck 
for some reason he suspects shes an agent for the bad guys is 
she or is she a western snoop only her spymaster knows but if 
you dont think she and the yank wont make love you probably 
believe in the tooth fairy 
there also is a key figure a cipher clerk erich hallhuber for 
the east german security service hes a homosexual whom bridges 
has been told is ripe for burning or blackmail 
the burning part of bridges search for the missing agents is 
done and proves a turning point it leads to his discovery of the 
assassination plot in which the missing agents will ah but 
weve said too much already as they are wont to say in the agency 
now the problem is how bridges can sound a warning in a world 
of perfidy 
its a tough problem made tougher by the traditional clash of 
british and american spy agencies and agents that also occurs here 
but something must be done to foil the sinister hardeyed 
highlevel soviet and east german plotters who call gorbachev a 
traitor its fun watching the doing 
it must be said that just another secret filmed in 
yugoslavia and the first in a series of forsyth stories to be 
filmed for the usa network is no day of the jackal there are 
no great surprises no razoredge tensions 
but its a welldone fastpaced effort akin to a good read on 
a quiet day you suspect you know how itll come out but you dont 
mind

if your public school is wondering how to observe coming 
religious holidays without getting tangled in churchstate issues 
a broad coalition of experts offers some tips 
the key advice is that religious holidays present a special 
opportunity for schools to do something theyve generally neglected 
to teach about religions but not to celebrate them 
information about them on which a severe educational gap lately 
has been recognized may focus on their origins histories how 
theyre observed and their meanings the guidelines say adding 
if the approach is objective and sensitive neither promoting 
nor inhibiting religion this study can foster understanding and 
mutual respect for differences in belief 
the guidelines called religious holidays in the public 
schools questions and answers was produced by representatives 
of l6 religious and educational groups embracing conservatives and 
liberals rarely in accord 
charles c haynes director of the americans united research 
foundation in silver spring md and former professor of world 
religions sparked academic interfaith effort 
if public schools are going to survive theyre going to have 
to find an appropriate place for religion in the functioning of the 
schools he said in a telephone interview 
without it public education is going to suffer and be torn 
apart 
concerning numerous recent studies that have shown general 
disregard of religion in public schools and in textbooks and 
widespread ignorance of religion he said 
in many schools fear of controversy has led to silence about 
religion the irony is that silence about it has led to more 
controversy and division its not approppriate simply to remove 
religion 
evidence is that the proper role of religion in school begins 
to restore faith in the public schools 
however that role is not religious advocacy or devotions in 
schools but the extension of knowledge about religions and 
understanding of their ideas and practices the guidelines 
emphasize 
they say that this month with christians celebrating christmas 
and jews celebrating hanukkah it would be unrealistic to ban 
all seasonal activities but they should focus on educational 
purposes for all students 
holiday concerts may appropriately include music related to 
christmas and hanukkah but religious music should not dominate 
the pamplet says advocating a mix of nonreligious holiday music 
with the religious 
any dramatic productions should emphasize cultural aspects of 
the holidays nativity pageants or plays portraying the hanukkah 
miracle are not appropriate in the public school setting 
its important that the approach be broad haynes said 
but to exclude traditional carols would be absurd we should not 
be afraid for students to be exposed to this sort of music 
demands for the pamphlet turned out in october exhausted the 
initial 75000 printing and another 50000 is being printed by the 
foundation part of the broad coalition producing the document 
it was a followup to another howto brochure turned out by the 
coalition in mid1988 on ways to teach about religion in public 
schools something urged by the us supreme court in 196263 when 
it banned devotionals there 
demand for that first pamphlet has passed the 200000mark and 
further printings have been ordered 
haynes who left his post at randolphmacon college six years 
ago to work on restoring teaching about religion to public 
education said the school people are so grateful that this 
problem is getting attention 
he said that banning the subject has marginalized religion 
and students get the same message from television and elsewhere 
that religion is funny and marginal although its the center 
of life to most people 
in a more religiously pluralistic society he said schools must 
become a place where a students religion whatever it is or none 
is respected and understood and where he can learn what others 
believe 
you just cant leave it at the school house door haynes 
added somehow its got to be acknowledged talked about and 
recognized 
he said religious illiteracy has grown through school avoidance 
of the subject causing difficulties in how we live with each 
other 
religion plays a central role in the lives of people 
throughout the world but were not preparing people to deal with 
that reality the potential for divisions is tremendous 
if religion is included educationlly he said it can relieve 
intergroup pressures and can do a lot to create a climate that is 
more inclusive for dealing with other issues 
with growing academic recognition of the unsound educational 
effects of simply shunning religion he said steps are being taken 
to remedy the situation 
texbooks are being revised to include more about religion and 
teacher institutes are being held to equip teachers for handling 
the subject haynes said the change is happening a lot more 
rapidly than i anticipated

when ed begley jrs manager first suggested 
the actor was being considered to costar in a comedy with meryl 
streep and roseanne barr begley was dubious 
the calls continued over the weeks and begley remained 
skeptical when a script was reported imminent he told his 
manager good you know ive got that little letter hole in my 
door you put the script right through that little slot when you 
get it 
to begleys astonishment the script of shedevil arrived 
from orion pictures 
one day i was set to do a videotape here in la it was sent 
to director susan seidelman in new york she apparently liked it 
and sent it to meryl she liked it then i met with susan seidelman 
and i liked her and she liked me the next thing i know i was 
working on the picture he recalled 
begley was cast as an ambitious accountant who leaves his 
slovenly wife barr for the selfenchanted author of romance 
novels streep barr then becomes the title role cooking up 
diabolical plots as revenge on her faithless husband and his 
willful temptress 
thus begley appears throughout the film with both stars who 
meet only briefly critics have marveled at streeps facility for 
comedy heretofore hidden on the screen behind accents and heavy 
dramatics 
shes done great comedy work over the years on the new york 
stage and yale drama school and what have you observed the 
lanky strawhaired actor people who were fortunate enough to 
see that know her well in the world of comedy shell do more 
shes great i dont think theres anything she cant do 
begley said her comedy often broke him up on the set but i 
got my revenge i beat her at scrabble often 
about roseanne barr it was her first motion picture and she 
was wonderful to work with i think she did a terrific job and 
hopefully shell do more she certainly has conquered the world of 
television you cant do any better than shes done going against 
a show like cosby the cosby show and doing well 
ive seen the show quite a bit its consistently funny and 
insightful i think if i do television again id like to do 
that 
until shedevil begley was best known as the smarttalking 
dr victor ehrlich on st elsewhere which brought him emmy 
nominations during each of its six seasons on nbc he has also 
played character roles in films such as the inlaws with peter 
falk and alan arkin the accidental tourist with william hurt 
and geena davis and scenes from the class struggle in beverly 
hills with jacqueline bisset 
begley grew up in the san fernando valley during his fathers 
heyday as a top character actor in films academy award supporting 
actor sweet bird of youth 1962 begley sr made no attempt 
to influence his sons choice of career but the boy knew at age 10 
that he wanted to act 
i knew what it was going in he remarked in an interview 
i knew there would be autographs requested i knew everything 
that went with it i dont have the excuse that some actors 
legitimately have i didnt bargain on this notoriety i just 
want to do my best work as an actor 
i cant make that claim i knew what it was because i saw my 
father go through it we had a hard time getting from point a to 
point b at disneyland or knotts berry farm or wherever we went 
together i knew if i did become an actor there was a 
possibility of that happening now my kids have to suffer through 
long lines going through an airport with people wanting autographs 
etc 
but its part of the job people are very friendly and nice 
begley started acting at 17 in my three sons and turned up 
on other series such as room 222 happy days and the 
doris day show for a few years he worked in standup comedy 
first with a partner then as a single he recalls the work as 
great experience but sometimes devastating 
i remember one night i was opening for john sebastian loggins 
and messina and poco at nassau coliseum in new york 18000 
people he said with a shudder i had the most incredibly great 
reaction when i first went out i did an opening bit in a police 
uniform that always went well with college crowds big applause 
laughter the whole thing 
about 10 minutes into it i started to lose them i had these 
hand props 11 by 14 photographs that were usually large enough for 
big audiences but past the 10th row they couldnt see a damn 
thing they started to lose interest and they began to go poco 
poco an angry mob i think they were ready to say give us 
barabbas next 
soon after i decided to go back to television and films

the vietnam war and civil rights have proved no 
match for heaven and hell in keeping mainline protestants in the 
pews according to a sociologist studying the presbyterian church 
usa 
benton johnson of the university of oregon who recently 
completed one study of the church and is in the middle of another 
said that as the concept of personal salvation was ridiculed by 
secular intellectual culture mainline churches turned to social 
issues to revitalize their denominations 
but activism on issues such as civil rights and the vietnam war 
has been a carrot without a stick leaving a generation of 
mainline protestants with few compelling reasons for belonging to a 
church and evangelism programs with limited chances of success he 
said 
the problems may be really formidable johnson said you 
have to have a good rap i dont know what the presbyterians are 
prepared to say with a straight face that they all agree on 
johnson recently set forth his theory on leaving church 
religious diversity and change at the annual meeting of the 
american academy of religion in anaheim calif 
in an interview johnson discussed his findings from a recently 
completed study of presbyterian general assembly announcements on 
social issues in the 20th century and from preliminary research in 
a study of presbyterians who were confirmed in the 1960s that he is 
doing with dean r hoge of the catholic university of america and 
donald r luidens of hope college 
hoge said early results in the research project which is 
expected to be finished in 1991 show that only about 55 percent of 
the presbyterians confirmed in the 1960s are still active in 
churches 
the presbyterian church which adopted evangelism and church 
development as its two priority goals at its 1989 general assembly 
lost more than a quarter of its members from 1970 to 1987 losing 
more than a million people and falling to less than 3 million 
members 
while it is still early to draw definitive conculsions on the 
membership decline johnson said the roots of the denominations 
current status go back to the end of the 19th century when the idea 
that individuals were predestined to either heaven or hell was 
losing credibility among the intellectual classes 
as the credibility of the religious tradition diminished the 
church lowered the costs of being a presbyterian johnson said 
by 1965 good presbyterians watched sunday football left 
religious education entirely to the sunday school practiced birth 
control drank martinis and went to movies he said 
the old agenda of sabbath observance temperance strict rules 
on divorce and birth control was replaced by a new agenda that 
began with the social gospel movement in the 1890s johnson said 
but while the new agenda was adopted wholeheartedly by church 
leadership it did not reach down into the pews he said 
if the good presbyterians of 1965 who drank martinis and 
watched football on sundays had also been actively assisting 
migrant workers or protesting us involvement in vietnam the loss 
of commitment to the denominations old agenda would have been 
offset by the generation of commitment to a new agenda he said 
today particularly faced with a new age movement that preaches 
against any concept of personal guilt and a decline of any notion 
that salvation is a desperate necessity because hell is the only 
alternative many people raised in the church no longer see 
sufficient benefits for membership he said 
while presbyterians in earlier days stayed and changed the 
church to adjust to cultural shifts those born since the second 
world war have tended to cut and run johnson said 
theres also probably the tendency the cheshire cats grin 
so to speak of these people having a general negative attitude 
toward christianity without knowing much about it 
from 1970 to 1987 the churchs sunday school attendance dropped 
precipitously from 19 million to 11 million 
the rev james e andrews the denominations chief executive 
said a decline in religious education has been a major factor in 
the churchs losses 
i think our biggest failure is the loss of our young people 
said andrews we quit fertilizing our own garden 
hoge a presbyterian said research has shown a lack of 
denominational loyalty among presbyterians many of whom would 
switch to another mainline denomination without batting an eye 
there is definitely a lack of a clear presbyterian identity 
he said 
but hoge said it is still too early to draw conclusions about 
ways to reverse the membership decline or produce a third great 
awakening in american society we dont even know the nature of 
the disease he said 
andrews said it is an oversimplification to blame the 
denominations losses on its social agenda 
i would pay more attention not to the loss of the stick of 
hellfire but the failure of the carrot that is there is no 
secular reward for spirituality he said

alexander junior stevens traveled seven 
miles across the bronx every morning to alfred e smith high 
school an allboys vocational school with a reputation as a quiet 
place a safe school 
junior was shot to death outside the school cafeteria nov 
14 a 15yearold classmate was charged the two were playing with 
a 22caliber pistol when it accidentally went off police said 
there are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kids 
are sitting there with guns in their bookbags they just havent 
decided to shoot yet said ed muir of the united federation of 
teachers the teachers union 
juniors was the first killing in a city school since 1978 
but in a system where violence is routine it caused little uproar 
among students 
the thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kids 
seem to be taking this so calmly its just another kid whacked 
said muir 
bruce irushalmi director of the board of education office of 
school safety said students bring guns to school because they 
dont feel safe going to and from school they say they need 
them to create a balance of power 
muir is more cynical some kids feel they actually need it for 
protection and some are businessmen who have large quantities of 
cash and thought it the prudent thing not to apply for a pistol 
permit 
from september 1988 to june 1989 1854 weapons were seized at 
schools ranging from razoredged box cutters to automatic weapons 
at 15 schools where roving teams of security guards used metal 
detectors five guns and 815 other weapons were confiscated during 
the 19881989 school year a year that saw 1356 students 
assaulted 183 robbed 78 sexually assaulted and 105 caught using 
controlled substances figures for this year were unavailable 
to balance the arms race new york city spent 62 million on 
security in 1988 about 1 percent of the 7 billion budget metal 
detectors accounted for about 4 million of that the rest 
supported 2450 uniformed but unarmed security guards who police 
a system with just under a million students 
if we were a police force we would be the 10th largest police 
force in the country irushalmi said 
to muir it isnt enough he cites the increase in gun incidents 
twice a week last year 19 in the first 34 school days of this 
year as evidence that the citys schools are dangerous places to 
be figures kept by his union show a 5 percent increase in crime 
inside schools during the 198889 school year 
preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11 percent increase in 
school crime in september and muir said 44 teachers were assaulted 
during the first month of school this fall compared to 27 during 
september 1988 
but irushalmi whose two children attend public schools says 
the problem is not inside the buildings reports of violence inside 
schools have fallen from 15000 a year in 1981 to 9000 in 198889 
outside is another story 
for anyone under 18 this is dodge city and you have to carry a 
piece he said unfortunately we dont have miss kitty at the 
long branch to make sure you check your piece at the door 
in one corner of this dodge city outside prospect heights high 
school in brooklyn a student was shot on the very first day of 
school 
theres no safety in prospect heights despite spot checks 
with metal detectors said bob brother abu 15 if they dont 
come on monday they put the weapons in their lockers so when the 
weapon detectors come on wednesday they have their weapons in the 
school already 
there aint no safety said his 17yearold friend who 
identified himself as carl or shrapnel insepticon a senior at 
erasmus hall high school in brooklyn he wore a blue bandana over 
his lower face jesse james style and said he was a member of the 
decepticons a teenage street gang named after evil characters in 
the transformers a cartoon show 
the loosely knit gang which has taken to bandanas as 
identification has been accused of taking part in halloween 
rampages on manhattans east side as well as in wolfpacktype 
attacks on students at bus and subway stations 
more than 100000 students stayed away from school on halloween 
apparently out of fear more than 250 high schoolage youths were 
arrested as they roamed the city robbing intimidating and 
assaulting pedestrians and merchants 
muir and the uft have proposed some remedies metal detectors in 
every school a police liaison for junior high schools stiffer 
penalties for anyone caught with guns but these steps all agree 
will not solve the underlying problems that lead to school violence 
the schools are a mirror of society irushalmi said citing 
drugs and crime the easy availability of weapons the diminution 
of values 
these kids dont distinguish between the schools and the 
streets muir said they dont see any difference 
we really think its related to drugs part of it has to do 
with the sales but another part is a lot of the kids parents are 
using drugs and the kids are acting out said gretchen rausch 
an assistant commissioner of the probation department who began her 
career as a probation officer in 1967 
arrests of kids ages 7 to 16 jumped 27 percent from 1987 to 
1988 she said 
but the kids say there is no simple reason why they prey upon 
each other and their teachers 
sean chittick 17 is a senior at murry bergtraum high school 
located across from police headquarters and regarded by many as one 
of the citys safer schools still he sees violence all around 
him and he is mystified 
it just be happening for no type of reason he said now 
they just be killing them for gold jewelry or you lookin at my 
girl

vote earned a story 10 points and a 10thplace listing one point 
the stories by ranking 
1 gorbachev assumed leadership in the soviet union in 1985 with 
a policy of reform of a faltering communist system in a series of 
stunning developments in 1989 he withdrew soviet troops from 
afghanistan and then stood aside as mass popular movements undercut 
communist power in poland hungary bulgaria czechoslovakia and 
east germany gorbachev even gave tacit approval in november as the 
incarnation of the cold war the berlin wall crumbled amid joyous 
celebrations by east and west germans 
2 aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome first made its 
deadly appearance in the united states in male homosexual 
communities it spread relentlessly among heterosexuals and drug 
addicts through sexual contact and shared hypodermic needles in an 
age of miracle drugs science could not find an antidote to the 
plague of aids lingering death 
3 republican reagan was elected in 1980 vowing to trim the 
federal government he cut taxes sharply and shrank social programs 
in a fundamental reversal of government trends huge defense 
outlays during his two terms however created enormous deficits 
and more than doubled the national debt the former film star

sent troops to the tiny caribbean island of grenada named the 
first woman to the supreme court softened his view of the soviet 
evil empire survived an assassins bullet and left office as

1980s in 1989 freedom began to blossom with the spring in 
beijing only to be brutally suppressed when chinese troops killed 
hundreds if not thousands of protesting students in tiananmen

and used some of the proceeds to supply proamerican guerrillas in

president george bush knew what and when 
10 washington haunted by memories of vietnam walked a 
tightrope all decade long through civil wars in el salvador and 
nicaragua efforts to support democratic government in el salvador 
were embarrassed by rightwing death squads within the military in 
leftist nicaragua us assistance for the contra guerrillas wound 
down as president bush succeeded reagan who had called the contras 
the moral equivalent of the founding fathers

editors note frank capra set his celebrated movie its a 
wonderful life in the central new york town of bedford falls but 
dont look for it on a map bedford falls is a fictional place set 
among the small towns between syracuse and rochester 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its christmas eve smalltown banker george bailey is short 
8000 and hes come to the railing of a snowcovered bridge 
somewhere in rural new york to end his life 
luckily for george in the place from where guardian angel 
clarence odbody comes its against the law to commit suicide 
clarence stops george by jumping into the icy river below george 
the goodest of good samaritans hears clarences call for help and 
dives in to save him and thats how clarence saves george 
george clarence and the simple people of bedford falls ny 
have reappeared for the past 43 christmases in endless reruns of 
frank capras holiday treat its a wonderful life 
the movie with its excellent use of screen narrative and 
effective lighting for black and white is one of capras greatest 
works a colorized version was made after television entrepreneur 
ted turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought 
mgmua entertainment corp with its huge film library for 15 
billion 
but capra was furious with the tinted results this 
monstrosity is an embarrassment to me and my friend james 
stewart the filmmaker said they splashed it all over with 
easter egg colors and they ruined it 
even the villian looks pink and cheerful the story 
therefore has been changed 
with the 1951 alastair sim version of a christmas carol and 
1947s miracle on 34th street the capra movie is one of the 
most popular holiday videos around and according to 1988 sales 
figures from erols inc the nations largest independent video 
chain the black and white version of its a wonderful life 
outsells the colorized version 
the movie tells the tale of the american little man the story 
of scrooge from bob cratchits viewpoint george bailey born for 
better things is trapped by circumstance in the same dreary life 
his father led 
its a wonderful life shows that while life can be an 
enriching norman rockwell experience it also can be smothering 
where you end up marrying the girl you went to high school with 
and you never get to go to europe said ray carney an american 
studies professor at boston university 
it tells us george is one of the most sad and lonely and 
tragic characters ever imagined i cry when i see it said 
carney who wrote a book called american vision the films of 
frank capra 
capra set the movie in the central new york town of bedford 
falls a fictional place set among the small towns between syracuse 
and rochester 
instead of george james stewart shaking the dust of this 
crummy little town off my feet events conspire to keep him in 
bedford falls running his fathers savings and loan and battling 
the rich town villain potter 
endless sacrifice to a town he hates embitters george on 
christmas eve he faces embezzlement charges after his bumbling 
uncle loses 8000 of the savings and loans money george stands 
on the bridge fingering his life insurance policy mulling potters 
mocking words youre worth more dead than alive 
clarence henry travers drops in and shows george what the 
world would be like if he had never been born bedford falls 
becomes a sleazy pleasure town run by potter his children are 
never born and his wife donna reed is an old maid people also 
die because george wasnt there because if he had lived he would 
save his brother from drowning and his brother in turn would be 
alive to save a shipload of servicemen during world war ii 
strange isnt it clarence says each mans life touches 
so many other lives and when he isnt around he leaves an awful 
hole doesnt he you see george you really had a wonderful 
life dont you see what a mistake it would be to throw it all 
away 
clarences words sum up the movie for jimmy hawkins who at age 
4 played tommy bailey georges son hawkins most memorable line 
was excuse me words he kept repeating to an enraged stewart 
thats the way capra worked said hawkins now a movie 
producer in a scene with a lot of tragedy going on when jimmy 
stewart is so angry he throws in that touch of levity thats 
great filmmaking 
while the movie has the happiest of endings its suicide theme 
apparently kept many viewers away the film opened dec 20 1946 
its really a very dark film said jeanine basinger a film 
professor and curator of the frank capra archives at wesleyan 
university in middletown conn in a way its a disturbing movie 
at the time i think maybe people just wanted something light like 
miracle on 34th street 
the movie sets the american dream alongside the american 
nightmare coming out of a period when the nation was confronting 
hitler and confronting evil and wondering about its adequacy as a 
society carney said 
while there were reports that rko lost 525000 on its a 
wonderful life the movie actually broke even or made just a 
little over its 3 million budget basinger said 
with hits such as mr smith goes to washington and it 
happened one night behind him capra hoped for better on his 
first postwar movie in the long run he got his wish 
its popularity grew after paramount which bought capras 
production company forgot to renew the copyright to its a 
wonderful life in 1974 television stations learned they could 
show the movie free marlo thomas starred in a tv remake 
the movie was based on a short story the greatest gift by 
philip van doren stern stern couldnt find a publisher so he 
printed 200 copies as christmas cards for friends 
rko bought the rights for 10000 planning to put cary grant in 
the lead after three scripts including efforts by clifford odets 
and dalton trumbo rko sold the project to capra in 1945 
with a new script in hand the director assembled one of 
hollywoods greatest ensembles of character actors casting many 
against type lionel barrymore known for his grandfatherly roles 
played the villain potter while hb warner best known for 
playing christ in cecil b demilles king of kings in 1927 
played the drunken druggist gower thomas mitchell scarlett 
oharas father in gone with the wind played the inept uncle 
billy 
while he had a magnificent cast and script capra himself gave 
the movie its lasting appeal through his vision of smalltown joy 
and agony capra should be viewed as one of americas greatest 
artists whose works rank with the paintings of edward hopper the 
stories of nathaniel hawthorne and the novels of henry james 
carney said 
some films like its a wonderful life and casablanca are 
as profound and moving as any art produced in this century he 
said the movie is one of the greatest american masterpieces

american telephone amp telegraph co says it may 
cut up to 25000 jobs this year and plans to cut 8500 in 1990 a 
result of laborsaving technology and tough competition 
atampt has been cutting jobs steadily since the bell system 
breakup of jan 1 1984 when the local phone companies were split 
off into seven regional companies nicknamed the baby bells 
the company said monday it estimates the total reduction in 1989 
will end up at 22000 to 23000 jobs and but added it could range 
as high as 25000 depending on the number of voluntary separations 
the cuts are due mostly to modernization and overstaffing

tens of thousands of americans are 
picking christmas trees this season by poring over catalogs rather 
than trudging around tree farms or corner lots 
a number of companies ranging from major merchandisers to tiny 
nurseries from michigan to maine are selling freshly cut 
christmas trees by mail 
i suppose some people consider it a very strange thing to do 
or perhaps the ultimate in being overboard with catalog ideas 
said katherine hartnett of ll bean inc 
freeport mainebased bean is in its fifth year of offering 
holiday greenery as well as clothing and outdoor gear hartnett 
said the mailorder companys trees sold out this year 
about 500000 people will bypass corner christmas tree lots and 
garden supply stores this year and order their trees from a 
catalog said dave baumann associate executive director of the 
milwaukeebased national christmas tree association 
people want tradition the feeling the scent the beauty of a 
real tree he said but time is at a premium 
mailorder trees make a small dent in the estimated 352 million 
christmas trees that will be sold nationwide this season but they 
have been a welcome new market for an industry facing an increasing 
oversupply problem 
the market for real trees is larger than it ever has been but 
growers this year are cutting an estimated 40 million trees said 
barry brand of the michigan christmas tree association that could 
mean millions of trees will remain in growers yards and on 
retailers lots by dec 25 
trees by mail have come on very strong in the last five years 
when ll bean was one of the first directmail merchandisers 
brand said this year theyre being sold by spiegel and sears 
and neimanmarcus and the sharper image literally all of the 
catalogs are carrying a real tree theyre taking something from a 
fad to an established practice 
mailorder trees generally are cut days before being stuffed 
into narrow boxes and shipped usually by private delivery 
companies the trees are expensive but their prices often are 
matched by those on christmas tree lots in some of the nations 
larger cities 
and the mailorder trees often are fresher because most trees 
sold from lots are cut at thanksgiving or earlier while mailorder 
trees typically are cut the day before shipment 
a 7foot sears roebuck and co tree sells for 7486 a 
mainegrown tree from ll bean costs 55 neither company would 
give figures for its tree sales 
many of the buyers appear to be bigcity dwellers who dont have 
cars and want to be spared the hassle of carrying a tree to their 
apartment 
but mailorder trees havent necessarily been an easy sell 
in michigan the nations largest christmas tree producing 
state nursery owners paul and jaye shereda have had trouble 
pitching their mailorder trees to chicagoans 
people are very suspicious jaye shereda said from her home 
in custer a tiny town in the heart of central michigans christmas 
tree country 
even though were charging 35 a tree or 55 for the package 
with the stand theyre afraid were too cheap theyre suspicious 
were going to send them junk she said 
their company land o pines spent a total of 10000 in 
advertising the past two seasons but sold only 85 trees shereda 
said 
chicagoan dan herrin thought his catalog tree was just perfect 
although he said his neighbors were surprised to see a 6foot 
evergreen slide out of the box left on the doorstep of his 
16thfloor apartment 
herrin said he doesnt miss the trips he and his wife took into 
the country to cut their own tree 
i think everybody thinks its a good sign of what technology 
can do for us all herrin said here were getting at a 
reasonable price a better product that what you used to be able to 
find 
its the overall picture of convenience

economic growth in the united states canada and 
britain likely will be below average among developed countries next 
year according to a top official of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
arthur dunkel directorgeneral of the gatt also said monday 
that prospects were dim for reducing the current account 
imbalances between major trading partners such as the united 
states west germany and japan and that traderestricting domestic 
policies remained widespread 
in the overview of developments in the international trading 
environment dunkel said there had been much progress towards trade 
liberalization since the current uruguay round of trade 
negotiations began in 1986 but protectionist pressures continued 
dunkel urged countries not to use unilateral or bilateral 
measures to settle trade disputes pending agreement on new more 
comprehensive international rules by next december when the 
fouryear uruguay round ends 
he warned that such action would jeopardize the success of the 
negotiations 
under terms of trade legislation enacted last year the united 
states in may singled out japan brazil and india as having the 
worst restrictions against us exports and threatened retaliation 
if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks 
the gatt report warned of continuing pressure by tradedeficit 
countries to use protectionism or to press trading partners to 
change their trading policies to help shrink the imbalances 
the problem is not just that such an approach could involve 
policy actions which would be inconsistent with the spirit if not 
the letter of the general agreement on tariffs and trade but 
that these policies by themselves will be ineffective in bringing 
about a lasting reduction in the imbalances dunkel stated 
the gatt directorgeneral said that although many countries had 
taken steps to liberalize trade policies to regulate imports 
remained widespread 
dunkel cited the growing use of antidumping measures whereby 
countries try to prevent goods from being dumped their markets 
at prices below those charged by the exporter in its own domestic 
market 
he said that after tariffs antidumping legislation was the 
most frequently invoked trade policy instrument in many 
industrialized countries 
the 97 members of gatt which sponsors trade liberalizing 
negotiations and sets world trade rules account for more than 80 
percent of international trade 
the gatt report said the united states was certain this year to 
again become the worlds leading exporter in dollar value 
recapturing the position it lost to west germany in 1986 
in the first three quarters of the year us merchandise 
exports grew by 15 percent more than double the dollar value 
increase recorded by japan and west germany the report said 
however the rate of expansion was down from 29 percent in 1988 
combined with a slight slackening of import growth from 9 percent 
to 8 percent this meant the reduction in the us trade deficit 
lost momentum dunkel said 
us exports in the first nine months of the year were worth 
some 2713 billion while the value of imports totalled 3656 
billion according to gatt figures 
the overall growth in world trade is likely to slacken next 
year even though 1990 would still mark the eighth consecutive year 
of expansion the report stated 
next year the report predicted the economies of west european 
nations were likely to grow by about 3 percent in output average 
for the industrialized world while growth in the united states 
canada and britain was expected to fall below the average 
for 1989 world output and merchandise trade were expected to 
expand in real terms by 3 percent and 7 percent respectively the 
report stated marking the fourth straight year trade growth had 
outstripped production growth 
last year international trade in goods grew by a record 85 
percent over 1987 according to gatt figures

the 1988 drought relief program paid millions of 
dollars to farmers across the country whose only claims to disaster 
were normal bouts with the perils of nature one reason the program 
was applied so broadly the associated press found was the very 
structure of the payment system the second story in a fourpart 
series cashing in on the drought explains how farmers 
allocated taxpayer dollars to their neighbors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rb reynolds decides how to spend 
millions of federal agriculture dollars each year he implements 
federal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government worker 
reynolds however is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician 
but a wheat and corn farmer here in windswept hartley county 
he was elected by his texas panhandle neighbors to be chairman 
of the threemember committee that runs hartley countys office of 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
every us county with some agriculture has a threefarmer 
committee elected by fellow farmers to direct the local office of 
the ascs which runs all the multibilliondollar federal 
agriculture payment programs 
its a job considered unique among government aid programs with 
the very recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many 
potential problems and conflicts are obvious would welfare 
mothers determine their friends monthly checks or students decide 
roommates eligibility for loans but agriculture officials believe 
the elected committee members are in the best position to assess 
fairly the losses suffered by their neighbors and to keep them 
honest 
we have to follow the rules that come down but we try to 
represent the farmer and his needs and what would be best for 
him reynolds said if you dont represent the farmer whos 
going to 
the question of who to protect the farmer or the government is 
at times a difficult one for conscientious committee members one 
day after reynolds sided with farmers in an interview he told a 
reporter he preferred to say committee members have to represent 
both sides and mediate to try to work something out 
most committee members interviewed for an associated press study 
of the 1988 drought relief effort said they voted for the good of 
their neighbors whenever possible 
i would say youre representing the farmer maybe thats not 
the way its supposed to be said mike bouris chairman of the 
riverside calif county committee 
you dont want your neighbor to be mad at you because he 
didnt qualify said john rigolizzo jr the camden county nj 
committee chairman yes you could say hes sticking up for his 
buddy and his neighbor but when were in this office were 
government employees 
committee members who are paid small stipends for their 
meetings take an oath of office pledging to uphold the laws of 
congress agriculture department officials say they expect the 
committees to protect taxpayers as well as be fair to farmers 
they represent both but they have rules and regulations they 
have to obey dan shaw the ascs deputy administrator in charge 
of state and county operations said from washington dc 
they cant just say this is a deprived area so lets take all 
the money in the treasury and throw it out here shaw said we 
feel peers are the people who can make the really good accurate 
decisions that need to be made 
committees have great latitude in administering agriculture 
programs from establishing normal harvests to deciding if a crop 
was cultivated properly they must sometimes analyze farmers 
financial standings and sort through corporations partnerships and 
trusts they also have to interpret an array of laws and 
regulations 
some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret the smart 
people can read that and find ways to get around it said don 
gronewald a hay farmer who is member of the kaufman county texas 
committee 
all of the programs are good programs and when they put them 
out they had good intentions but youre going to find somebody 
abusing and using the program to their benefit and that makes it 
harder for the honest joe gronewald said 
agriculture experts say farming in america is so vast that the 
local committee system is the only fair way to administer the aid 
programs 
there are these glitches two counties end up rendering two 
different decisions said bob bergland agriculture secretary 
under former president carter but you have to have room for 
local judgment id say it works better than almost any other 
scheme you can think of 
in the case of the drought program many committees had to set 
crop yields and estimate how much would have been harvested in a 
normal year as well as decide if a farmer kept his crop properly 
fertilized weeded and if possible watered 
and the committees of three had to decide whether each applicant 
farmer was eligible 
in some cases a county committee was more gracious with its 
constituents than either insurance companies evaluating the same 
losses or committees in neighboring counties interpreting the same 
regulations the ap found 
a crop insurance company balked at paying one oklahoma farmer an 
irrigated yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo because 
he had watered just once insurance paid only the dryland yield of 
28 bushels but the county committee granted drought relief based 
on the irrigated 69bushel yield the farmer received 4467 
the committee made a determination that it was watered said 
david f barnes jr director of the texas county okla ascs 
office 
the chaves county nm committee decided to pay a farmer 
18285 for cotton damage caused by cold rainy weather and 
high winds although the bill contained provision for neither 
freezelike damage nor wind damage 
the drought relief program was particularly troublesome for some 
committees because it was set up with such haste officials said 
some farmers harvested their crops before applying for aid making 
losses difficult to verify 
in gaines county texas ascs director john wayne hall said he 
struggled with 1988 claims for lost winter wheat a crop planted 
in 1987 and cut months before congress even considered the drought 
legislation 
how can i know what kind of product that boy had out there it 
was long gone hall said in 88 we made a lot of judgments 
a recent general accounting office report noted that the 1988 
relief program was hard to administer because it required county 
officials to determine on short notice payments on close to 500 
crops from almonds to zucchini the officials had little 
experience or data on most of tose crops 
the program happened awful fast said steve verrill 
committee chairman in middlesex county mass it was the disaster 
in the midwest and everybody including the politicians were 
talking it up and they were in an awful hurry to get the money 
out 
both the elected farmers and the county directors they hire say 
the pressure from farmers even in more normal years can be 
intense 
if i give everybody what they want i can get along said 
hall if i say hey the regulations say you cant do that it 
makes em mad 
hall sometimes makes em mad anyway 
as long as they the government pay me ill enforce it he 
said

the 1988 drought assistance bill for us 
farmers set a record for disaster programs totaling 39 billion 
in payments when all applications had been processed 
this year with the drought area reduced and the severity 
lessened congress tightened eligibility requirements and pulled 
the purse strings tighter authorizing less than 25 percent of the 
money released in 1988 
here are details of the two relief programs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
congress authorized 39 billion in cash payments to farmers 
who could prove crop losses in 1988 the 1989 authorization is 897 
million 
both programs set a 100000 limit per producer on combined 
payments for crop losses and livestock relief 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under each program an applicant could not have a gross annual 
income greater than 2 million 
growers had to absorb crop losses if they totaled less than 35 
percent of normal production the programs differed for losses 
above 35 percent 
the 1988 bill encompassed all crops from such program crops 
as corn wheat and cotton that the government supports with price 
subsidies to riskier crops like kiwi fruit or endive 
the 1989 bill pays on losses of 35 percent to 50 percent only 
for program crops farmers of nonprogram crops are paid only if 
losses totaled more than 50 percent of a normal harvest whether 
producers receive aid also depends on whether they participated in 
federal commodity programs and bought crop insurance 
the 1988 bill provided two tiers of payment farmers received 
65 percent of a preestablished payment rate based on such 
factors as market prices and subsidies for losses of 35 percent 
to 75 percent of normal production they got 90 percent of the 
payment rate if losses topped 75 percent 
in 1989 the highest payment for any loss was 65 percent of the 
payment rate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both programs required farmers with losses greater than 65 
percent to buy federal crop insurance the subsequent year each 
bill permitted some instances in which crop insurance could be 
waived 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 1988 bill permitted farmers to receive aid on the early 
loss of crops such as winter wheat or cotton even if they 
replanted the same acres with different crops and had normal 
harvests 
to prevent such double dipping the 1989 law sharply reduced 
benefits to farmers who chose to plant replacement crops due to 
drought or other weather conditions critics said this penalized 
farmers who were simply trying to help themselves and the law was 
modified in october to be more generous 
as modified aid payments on damaged crops will be reduced only 
if the value of the replacement crop is more than half of the 
countys average yield and then only by the value above the 50 
percent threshold

this is a summary of the disaster assistance act of 1988 and 
procedures farmers followed to collect aid 
the program originally was written to provide cash to farmers 
who suffered crop losses of more than 35 percent due to drought 
hail excessive moisture or related condition in 1988 
farmers who lost more than 65 percent of their normal harvest 
were required to protect themselves with federal crop insurance 
this year 
the bill covered all crops in all states not just drought 
areas as its regulations moved from the halls of congress to the 
county offices where the checks were written the list of weather 
conditions eligible for aid grew it eventually included 
depending on the individual county insects sandstorms fungus 
high winds and cold 
the bill required farmers to state their acreage whether it was 
irrigated andor insured the normal yield and the actual 
production on that acreage they also had to state the cause for 
their loss and in what manner the land had been farmed 
their applications for aid were approved or denied by 
threemember committees of locally elected farmers serving as the 
governments agents 
regulations require only 5 percent of aid applications to be 
verified for accurate information although many offices said they 
routinely checked 15 percent as with other farm payment programs 
paperwork remained at the county offices no regulation requires 
data on individual farms to be routinely forwarded to state or 
federal headquarters 
the relief act stated that payments were limited to 100000 per 
farmer and that no producer with gross revenues in excess of 2 
million was eligible for aid 
checks were written at the county office only county totals of 
aid not individual summaries were fed into national computers 
federal agriculture officials have not yet compiled figures on the 
amount of aid disbursed based on the crops damaged or on the 
specific weather problems cited for crop losses

delays in delivering an expanded indictment of 
junk bond pioneer michael milken are expected to push back his 
trial by at least six months to september 1990 according to 
individuals close to the case 
the government had said it planned to bring new charges in 
october superseding a 98count indictment against milken his 
brother lowell and a former drexel trader 
but now the federal grand jury hearing the milken case is 
expected to hand up an indictment listing additional charges and 
defendants either next week or shortly after jan 1 1990 sources 
close to the case who asked not to be named said monday 
milkens trial on wideranging racketeering and securities fraud 
charges is scheduled to start in march 11 months after the 
original indictment was issued 
defense and prosecution attorneys would meet to set a new trial 
date once the superseding indictment is returned and the defendants 
enter pleas defense lawyers speaking privately said the trial 
likely would not begin before september and possibly could start as 
late as january 1991 
michael and lowell milken have pleaded innocent and said they 
intend to fight charges of insider trading tax fraud takeover 
rigging and numerous other violations that allegedly occurred from 
1984 to 1986 
the original 110page indictment handed up by a federal grand 
jury on march 29 after a 2year investigation focuses on an 
alleged illegal relationship between milken and jailed stock 
speculator ivan boesky 
the new indictment reportedly will include allegations of 
illegal stock and bond deals with drexel clients other than boesky 
including solomon asset management and columbia savings and loan 
association of beverly hills calif 
boesky who is eligible for release from prison in april is 
expected to testify at milkens trial additional charges 
defendants and a roster of witnesses who have been granted immunity 
in exchange for testimony are expected to reduce the governments 
reliance on boesky 
sources on monday confirmed a report that gary winnick a former 
top associate of milkens at drexels highyield bond division in 
beverly hills calif was given immunity from prosecution and 
ordered to testify in the case 
winnick previously was subpoenaed to turn over documents but 
never was threatened with prosecution his lawyer gary naftalis 
declined to comment assistant us attorney john carroll did not 
return a call seeking comment 
also the wall street journal reported monday the justice 
department had approved bringing racketeering charges in the milken 
case against three other former drexel workers and against former 
drexel trader bruce newberg who was named in the first indictment 
a justice department spokesman said the department would not 
comment 
milken attorney martin flumenbaum said the leaks concerning 
the grand jury process are designed to deny michael milken a fair 
trial we will not comment on those leaks whether true or not and 
will no try this case in the press 
newberg was sentenced to three months in prison and ordered to 
forfeit 200000 on securities fraud and racketeering charges in 
the princetonnewport partners trial last summer his attorneys are 
expected to argue that he should not be tried twice on similar 
charges 
milken 43 has set aside about 700 million in assets as part 
of a bond package and is free pending trial milken widely 
credited with reshaping us corporate finance through the use of 
highyield highrisk junk bonds resigned from drexel earlier this 
year to form an investment consulting firm

domestic advertising spending should grow 
slightly faster in 1990 than it did in 1989 and should improve 
further through the next decade a prominent media forecaster says 
robert j coen who heads the forecasting unit at the 
advertising agency mccannerickson said in his semiannual 
projection monday that ad spending will rise 62 percent next year 
to 1326 billion following 58 percent growth in 1989 
the outlook for the opening year of the decade is rather 
modest but the pace of ad growth can be expected to improve as the 
decade unfolds he said 
coens estimate included projected increases of 63 percent in 
national ad spending to 7385 billion next year and 62 percent 
in local ad spending to 5879 billion 
national ad spending rose 59 percent this year while local ad 
spending was up 55 percent he said 
a year ago coen projected a 61 percent spending increase for 
1989 and boosted that estimate last summer to 69 percent 
he said ad spending came in below both projections because of 
slowerthanexpected growth in direct mail advertising due to a 
postal rate increase 
advertising overseas is expected to rise 5 percent to 1337 
billion next year matching its 1989 rise coen said 
his remarks came at the start of a weeklong media conference for 
securities analysts conducted for the 17th year by the investment 
firm painewebber inc 
coen said economists expect the us gross national product will 
grow 58 percent in 1990 including inflation down from 72 percent 
in 1989 
but coen said he saw signs indicating the ad outlook is 
improving despite the weakening economy stronger than expected 
growth in ad spending in the mass consumer media such as radio 
television magazines and newspapers in 1989 and healthy growth in 
key ad categories such as automobiles restaurants liquor and 
computers 
he said national advertisers are expected to make their biggest 
ad spending increases in the broadcast media a 69 percent jump in 
1990 
cable tv and syndicated tv will have doubledigit growth again 
although below their 30 percent and 35 percent increases of 1989 
coen said while radio will be up but at a slower pace 
he said the three major tv networks also will have an increase 
of unspecified proportions compared with almost no growth in ad 
revenue in 1989 
in a separate appearance david f poltrack senior vice 
president for planning and research at cbs broadcast group said he 
expected a combined 8 percent to 9 percent rise in revenues for 
cbs abc and nbc next year and compound annual growth of 75 
percent through 1995 
coen said national print advertising will rise 66 percent with 
magazine growth moderating and spending in newspapers remaining 
soft 
local newspaper advertising spending is expected to rise 60 
percent held back to some extent by very soft demand for 
classified advertising coen said local advertising on broadcast 
media is expected to rise 66 percent with a stimulus from 
congressional campaign ads 
in a separate panel discussion of the outlook for newspapers in 
1990 jerome s tilis a marketing executive for knightridder 
newspaper sales said he expects a 5 percent increase in overall 
newspaper ad revenue in 1990 compared with estimated growth of 5 
percent to 6 percent this year 
he said he expects turmoil caused by takeovers in the retailing 
business will settle down and help retail advertising in 
newspapers and that gains in real estate and automotive classified 
advertising will help offset a drop in helpwanted ads 
tilis said newspapers should benefit from price increases for 
direct mail advertising continuing fragmentation of the network tv 
audience and development of newspaper networks such as the one that 
resulted in creation of an advertising island in the middle of 
the stock listings in some papers 
jack butcher circulation director of the tampa tribune said he 
expects industrywide circulation gains next year amounting to less 
than a quarter percent daily and less than 1 percent on sundays or 
about the same as in 1989 
homer taylor vice presidentsupply for knightridder inc said 
newsprint costs may fall 5 percent on average in 1990 compared 
with an average 6 percent decline this year 
gordon medenica director of planning for the new york times 
co said newspaper earnings should be up by a modest uptick but 
nonetheless up compared with this year

georgiapacific corps proposed takeover 
of great northern nekoosa corp could be made more affordable if 
the hostile suitor sold five great northern mills according to a 
consultants report unsealed monday by a federal judge 
great northern immediately accused georgiapacific of a 
coverup but georgiapacific disputed the contention it had a 
secret plan to sell the mills in millinocket and east 
millinocket maine valdosta ga and nekoosa and port edwards 
wis 
us district judge gene carter unsealed the private study 
which was included in a great northern counterclaim that accused 
georgiapacific of violating federal securities laws by trying to 
keep the study secret lawyers had argued over the unsealing in a 
closeddoor session friday 
georgiapacific fought disclosure of the document but once it 
was unsealed the atlantabased company quickly issued a statement 
saying that the consultants study had been rejected as the merger 
attempt was planned 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr and other 
corporate executives have been in maine recently to say there were 
no plans to sell any maine assets to pay for the tender offer of 
63 per share or 38 billion great northern is incorporated in 
maine 
the study commissioned by georgiapacific before it made its 
initial offer of 58 per share oct 31 paints a different picture 
but georgiapacific said it never accepted the studys 
recommendations 
great northern saw the study differently 
the public should know this document exists in order to weigh 
statements made by mr hahn and georgiapacific representatives 
about their motives about their plans and what went into their 
planning great northern attorney robert a moore said 
the study indicated that georgiapacific could cut its merger 
costs from 44 billion to 33 billion by selling the mills great 
northern said 
great northern chairman william r laidig issued a statment from 
company headquarters in norwalk conn that said i am appalled 
quite frankly that even after we discovered this study 
georgiapacific attempted to continue its coverup forcing us to 
go to court to have the judge order the disclosure of our claims to 
the public 
great northerns counterclaim was made in response to a lawsuit 
filed in us district court here by georgiapacific which is 
challenging poison pill provisions of great northerns bylaws 
as well as maines antitakeover statute which forces hostile 
suitors to wait five years before merging with a targeted company

a popular home computer service has eliminated a 
bulletin board that fostered an electronic shouting match 
between homosexuals and christian fundamentalists but it denies it 
was pressured to do so 
prodigy an ibmsears joint venture said monday the bulletin 
board was cancelled because it was too lightly used but some vocal 
customers say prodigy simply wanted to avoid controversy 
the dispute over prodigys health spa bulletin board is the 
first notable controversy to affect the service which has grown 
rapidly in the past year and now serves more than a quartermillion 
users in 160000 subscriber households 
prodigy officials while dismayed about the negative publicity 
see the health spa fight as evidence that the service has attracted 
some highly committed customers 
if we werent expanding so rapidly i dont think we would 
have gotten this kind of attention said brian ek a spokesman at 
prodigy headquarters in white plains ny 
prodigy is a 10amonth service for personal computers that 
gives users access to services for shopping airline reservations 
news and stock trading it also has bulletin boards which let 
subscribers post electronic messages and communicate with each 
other 
health spa essentially was a forum for people to post news and 
exchange information on healthrelated topics 
it was discontinued last wednesday on short notice according to 
several users the only controversial section of it was one on 
emotional health which included discussions of such topics as 
mental health the section became a battleground of homosexuals and 
fundamentalists and required constant supervision and occasional 
censorship 
other sections covered topics such as health fitness and 
support groups 
some users said the complaints about the discontinuation were 
coming from homosexuals while others are coming from people who 
used the other sections and believe they were caught in the middle 
a georgia user who asked not to be identified said he had 
participated in the debates on the bulletin board from the gay 
viewpoint he also said some subscribers had complained that 
homosexuality was not an appropriate topic because children could 
be reading 
prodigys ek said health spa was cut because it was lightly 
used but some protesting subscribers dispute that 
one survey showed the emotional health bulletin board getting an 
average of 20 pages a day in entries compared to one or two pages 
a day for many other bulletin boards that remain in operation said 
larry holliday a new york executive a page is a computer screens 
worth of information 
holliday said he did not use the emotional health section but 
did use other sections of health spa 
ek said the heavy use was by a small number of people he said 
other services with few entries were kept because many people 
browsed through them without making entries 
ek also said the monitoring to make sure health spa met decency 
standards for a family service was timeconsuming and said 
bulletin board monitors frequently had to reject submissions due to 
profanity and references to sexual practices 
its a costbenefit ratio he said he indicated possible 
grounds for compromise by saying some parts of health spa might be 
brought back in a different form 
prodigy differs from other computer services in that the 
bulletin boards are only a small part of what it offers it also 
differs in that it carries advertising which constantly appears on 
a portion of the screen 
some subscribers say they believe without specific evidence 
that prodigy is trying to avoid any controversy or offensiveness to 
please advertisers who account for most of its revenue 
we are simply the people who are offered up for sale which is 
why what we think isnt that important said cyndie merten of san 
jose calif 
ek denies that as well as allegations that christian 
fundamentalists brought pressure on prodigy 
prodigy has not yet achieved profitability but has the backing 
of two companies with deep pockets international business machines 
corp and sears roebuck amp co 
ek said he finds it hard to understand why prodigy has drawn 
such criticism considering that newspapers routinely screen 
letters to the editor and television networks drop shows that 
arent working out 
were a family service if we feel that there is something in 
there that should not be in there for a family audience we do not 
put it in he said 
the discontinuation of health spa was reported sunday by the san 
jose mercury news

american telephone amp telegraph co says it may 
cut up to 25000 jobs this year and plans to eliminate 8500 more 
in 1990 a result of laborsaving technology and tough competition 
analysts on monday praised atampts costslashing which they said 
should help the company improve profitability 
its really demonstrating that a very very significant 
cultural change is going on within atampt bob allen the chairman 
is recognizing that the ultimate boss is the shareholder said 
charles nichols a prudentialbache securities inc analyst 
the cuts were less popular with atampts largest union the 
communications workers of america which said customer service was 
bound to suffer it said atampt was being shortsighted by cutting 
skilled employees at a time when labor shortages are developing 
we can only conclude that atampt cares more about cutting costs 
in the short run than about building revenue for the long run 
said gaye williams mack a union spokeswoman 
atampt stock rose 75 cents to 4437 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
atampt has been eliminating jobs steadily since the bell system 
breakup of jan 1 1984 when the local phone companies were split 
off into seven regional companies known as the baby bells 
employment fell from 373000 then to 297000 by the end of october 
1989 
about half the cuts have come through layoffs and half through 
retirements and other voluntary separations spokesman burke 
stinson said 
stinson said he estimates the total reduction in 1989 will end 
up at about 22000 to 23000 jobs and said the drop could range as 
high as 25000 depending on the number of voluntary separations 
modernization is one big reason for the cuts automated 
switching technology has allowed atampt to cut its ranks of operators 
drastically also many employees who operated installed and 
serviced phone equipment are being phased out as the company 
changes to hightech digital equipment 
another reason for cuts is that atampt was overstaffed before the 
breakup it could afford extra layers of employees as long as it 
was a monopoly but rising competition since the breakup has forced 
it to pare down 
atampts aggressiveness in cutting costs is matched by a new 
determination to fight back in the longdistance business against 
mci communications corp and us sprint communications co its 
closest rivals 
nichols said he expects those companies to continue eating into 
atampts share of the market but far more slowly than in the past 
few years the company also is battling rivals in sales of network 
switching equipment office phone systems and computers 
a sign of atampts toughguy approach was its recent victory 
against asian makers of smallbusiness phone systems the 
international trade commission ruled on a company complaint that 
phone systems from japan and taiwan were being dumped in the 
united states at unfairly low prices and ordered special tariffs on 
them 
atampt last week told analysts it planned to cut 6000 jobs next 
year in the network services division which runs the longdistance 
network it also plans to cut 700 in business communications 
systems 1400 in material management and services and 400 in 
general business systems 
the largest portion of the 1989 cuts came from atampts first 
drive to cut middle management through sweetened pension offerings 
for those who accepted early retirement about 12000 to 13000 
managers have chosen early retirement under that program 
two thousand other managers left before that incentive program 
began the company also cut 5000 operators and says it expects to 
cut other jobs through normal attrition possibly as many as 6000

frances last remaining currency controls will be 
lifted on jan 1 1990 the finance ministry announced tuesday 
the widely anticipated move will allow french residents to hold 
foreign currency accounts inside the country and open bank accounts 
outside france 
under a timetable set up by the european community france and 
most other common market countries have until july 1 1990 to lift 
their controls on capital movement spain portugal and greece have 
until jan 1 1993 
the bulk of frances currency controls covering major capital 
movement by corporations were dismantled gradually in a series of 
steps that began in 1984 
the ministry said in a statement the lifting of the controls 
reflects government confidence in the good health of the french 
economy and in the stability of our currency 
the move also underlines our desire to accelerate progress 
toward european monetary union the statement said 
a ministry spokeswoman confirmed that french residents will be 
obliged to notify authorities when they open foreign bank accounts 
as they must do for accounts opened in france 
currency traders said the announcement did not have any 
immediate impact on the foreign exchange market they said the lack 
of response reflected the relatively limited scope of the remaining 
controls and the markets knowledge that they were already 
scheduled to come down by july 1 1990 at the latest 
the decision by france to lift its exchange controls removes one 
of the obstacles frequently cited by british prime minister 
margaret thatcher that has prevented britain from seeking full 
membership for its currency in the european monetary system

rapidly growing imports pushed japans trade 
surplus sharply lower in november its seventh consecutive monthly 
decline from yearearlier levels the finance ministry announced 
tuesday 
the trade surplus calculated on a customsclearance basis 
shrank 462 percent to 353 billion from a year earlier when it 
registered 656 billion dollars the ministry said the surplus 
also fell from octobers 465 billion 
exports dropped 29 percent from their yearearlier level to 
2203 billion while imports climbed 148 percent to 1850 
billion the ministry said 
the trade surplus latest decline from yearearlier levels was 
the largest since october 1982 when it fell 541 percent 
japans surplus with the united states declined from 
yearearlier levels for the second consecutive month falling 193 
percent to 357 billion 
imports from the united states buoyed by increased purchases of 
aircraft office equipment and nonferrous metals grew 121 percent 
to 408 billion exports to the united states dropped 52 percent 
to 765 billion largely because of falling auto shipments 
ministry officials said 
ministry officials attributed the decline in the overall surplus 
mainly to growing imports of crude oil both in value and volume 
terms because of rising world oil prices the average price of oil 
jumped 383 percent from a year earlier to 1741 a barrel while 
volume increased by 129 percent to 49 billion gallons they said 
imports of manufactured goods also rose 13 percent from the 
previous year and accounted for 506 percent of overall imports 
they said it was the sixth month in a row that manufactured goods 
exceeded 50 percent of total imports 
in contrast exports of motor vehicles fell 94 percent because 
of sluggish demand and rising production by japanese manufacturers 
in north america they said steel exports fell 236 percent 
because of weak worldwide sales the officials added 
compared to their october levels exports declined 44 percent 
and imports rose 07 percent the ministry said 
although japans trade surplus a target of sharp criticism from 
the united states and other trading partners has fallen for seven 
months in a row ministry officials said they were not sure whether 
the decline was permanent 
we have to see what the future will bring said an official 
in charge of trade data a lot of things will depend on how oil 
prices will change and there are other elements of uncertainty 
after seasonal factors were taken into account the november 
trade surplus came to 470 billion up from 377 billion the 
previous month 
japan calculates its trade surplus figures on a 
customsclearance basis in which freight and insurance costs are 
included in import figures but not in exports

ual corp management has drafted a preliminary 
543 billion employee buyout proposal for the parent of united 
airlines but unions representing ual workers appear to be balking 
a published report said today 
the plan would place a nominal value of 240 on a share of 
common stock the chicago tribune reported quoting unidentified 
sources it also contemplates ual employees owning about twothirds 
of the stock after a buyout and public stockholders about 
onethird the tribune said 
management officials made buyout proposals last week to united 
airlines pilots and flight attendants unions the paper said 
while the ual board of directors is scheduled to meet wednesday 
the sources said management is not expected to present any buyout 
proposal then 
in october a 675 billion or 300 a share buyout attempt 
failed for lack of financing 
that proposal was undercut by the machinists union which 
opposes a highly leveraged buyout of the airline 
a machinists source told the tribune that if speculation about 
a 240 a share offer is true that proposal would be rejected by 
us as too high 
the pilots union hasnt acknowledged receiving the rumored 
proposal the flight attendants said they had gotten it but 
declined comment until it was more thoroughly studied 
the tribune said its sources believed the pilots feel the 
proposal falls short of some of their demands including having a 
voice in running the company 
the sources said management increased somewhat the contract 
concessions it is seeking from the flight attendants in return for 
their participation in an employee stock ownership plan

the economy will steer clear of a recession next 
year but only grow moderately the nations purchasing managers 
predicted today 
although a recession isnt forecast more corporate purchasing 
executives are worried about economic conditions than ever before 
in the 27 years the national association of purchasing management 
has asked its members to say how they feel about the future 
the exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in 
1990 is overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth albeit 
moderate said robert j bretz chairman of the associations 
business survey committee 
corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they 
must make spending decisions based on assumptions about how 
business will be how much inflation will erode buying power and 
other factors 
the organizations semiannual forecast released at a news 
conference said 64 percent of the members expect business to be 
better rather than worse in 1990 than in 1989 
economic growth will average 5 percent next year before 
adjusting for inflation with the second half of the year improving 
from a weak first six months rising capital expenditures 
expanding exports and slowing imports will contribute to the 
increase in economic output 
inflation will continue easing next year after turning out to be 
milder than previously expected in 1989 
purchasers said their prices increased an average of 26 percent 
in 1989 sharply lower than the 5 percent reported for 1988 and 
less than the 37 percent increase originally predicted for 1989 
next years inflation numbers also look tame prices are 
predicted to rise an average of 16 percent 
clearly this projects a continuing moderating trend in the 
rate of inflation bretz director of materials management at 
pitney bowes inc said at the news conference at a new york hotel 
ample supplies and reduced demand are restraining inflation 
bretz said 
turning to the overall outlook for the next 12 months 64 
percent of the purchasers expressed concern up from 57 percent 
when the last survey was taken in may and the highest proportion in 
the past 27 years 
only 31 percent of the purchasers said they were satisfied or 
optimistic about next year down from 42 percent in may and 48 
percent a year ago this was the least to express this view since 
september 1981 when the economy was mired in a recession 
the purchasers group gathers information for its twice yearly 
reports from replies to questions asked of purchasing executives in 
more than 300 industrial companies all over the country 
todays was the 38th semiannual forecast to be issued by the 
tempe arizbased organization

companies that raise capital through initial 
public stock offerings have a faster growth rate than companies in 
general says a study financed by the organization that runs the 
overthecounter stock market 
two researchers at the state university of new york at stony 
brook professor glenn yago and assistant jeff yanenbaum compared 
the performance of 426 companies making initial public offerings 
ipos from 1943 to 1985 with companies in their industry as well 
as industry averages 
we found that going public tends to have a profound effect on 
corporate performance said the studys authors who are with 
stony brooks w averell harriman school for managament and policy 
the study funded and released monday by the washingtonbased 
national association of securities dealers compared the 
performance of companies making ipos and their respective industry 
in several key areas employment revenues sales per employee 
capital investment capital spending working capital net fixed 
assets and total assets 
but because of certain data limitations information on some 
of our variables was not available for all ipos in our study the 
28page study explained in its methodology section 
still we were able to examine at least 268 ipos for each 
variable and in some cases considerably more it continued 
in each of th areas we examined ipo firms outpaced their 
industries by a considerable margin yago and tanenbaum said 
in a period when corporate industry as a whole was losing jobs 
the ipo firms showed substantial employment gains in other 
variables we examined ipo firms grew from 25 to nearly 17 times 
faster than did companies in general 
nasd which operates the nasdaq stock quotation system is a 
selfregulatory organization that oversees stocks nor listed on 
stock exchanges the overthecounter market 
all of the companies studied were listed on nasdaq according to 
the nasd more than 85 percent of all initial public offerings 
brought to market during the past five years were listed on nasdaq

if the stock market seems unable to make up its 
mind you can attribute it to confusion about the future of 
corporate profits which have been declining for a full year 
based on the vast range of opinions from executives and stock 
analysts next year can mean an end to the profits recession a 
rebound a continuation or even a worsening 
the outlook is that varied clouded by unusual uncertainties 
the chief of them seeming to be a gut feeling that an economy 
entering its eighth straight year of expansion is bound to need a 
rest 
of only slightly less concern seems to be difficiulty in 
comprehending the relaxation of world tensions the probability of 
declines in defense spending and the chances of greater trade with 
europe and china 
a survey of 1500 business executives by dun amp bradstreet in 
august showed expectations for higher sales and profits had dropped 
to the lowest levels in four years for the current quarter but 
gave no indication beyond that 
however the depth of the feelings revealed in that survey and 
the fact that profit expectations had been dropping throughout the 
year make unlikely the possibility of a sudden turnabout in 
corporate confidence 
that survey showed retailer expections for salesprofits gains 
were at their lowest since the fourth quarter of 1983 and that 
combined retailerwholesalermanufacturer profit expectations were 
at the lowest since 1985 
the profit erosion began very late in 1988 and worsened 
throughout the past year a survey of 1989 thirdquarter results by 
the wall street journal showed a 21 percent drop and one by 
business week showed a 22 percent decline 
while such a record suggests no quick turnaround the outlook is 
viewed quite optimistically by some investment analysts 
zacks investment research which collects earnings predictions 
from 2000 analysts and compiles a consensus forecast contends 
that median profit growth should be 129 percent in 1990 
surpassing 1989s expected 96 percent rise 
financial analysts however have been known to be wrong so 
financial world magazine which published the research wisely 
asked zacks to make a breakdown into three groups companies that 
surpass wall street expectations those that come closest to 
matching analyst estimates and companies that often earn less than 
forecast 
it suggested that readers be wary of stocks that regularly 
surprise analysts 
while concerned about the profits shrinkage edward yardeni 
director of economics for prudentialbache securities believes 
worries might be overdone he feels the profits decline has about 
reached bottom 
odds are that the worst of the yearoveryear comparisons will 
occur during the fourth quarter of this year yardeni recently 
told that firms clients he said comparisons should turn positive 
by the 1990 second quarter 
still another unknown draws questions wright investors service 
calls attention to a surprise factor that seems to play a prominent 
role of late in the affairs of profitseeking enterprises 
unusual charges and writeoffs have increasingly become a 
regular feature of fourthquarter earnings reports it said 
companies have been forced into costly restructurings and banks 
have had to write off uncollectable loans 
while such events can to some extent be anticipated total 
surprises such as union carbides deadly gas leak in bhopal 
india and exxons nearly 2 billion oil spill in alaska also tend 
to unnerve investors

a wife gives her husband a pricey gold watch for christmas and 
he splurges on a diamond pendant for her 
but just after the new year their home is burglarized and both 
gifts become ghosts of christmas past because neither was 
adequately insured 
insurance companies often paint such gloomy scenarios to help 
drum up more business and some have been doing a lot of it with 
concerted media campaigns during the current holiday buying season 
for many consumers a little extra insurance can protect valued 
gifts and provide peace of mind but experts say coverage and 
costs vary significanlty between companies and states 
dont buy the first policy that someone tries to sell you 
says stephen brobeck executive director of the washingtonbased 
consumer federation of america 
brobeck urges consumers to first check their homeowner or tenant 
insurance policies to see whats covered if an item in question is 
valuable enough to be insured separately they should shop around 
for the best rates he said 
other coverage may be available from credit card companies 
american express for example automatically insures goods bought 
with its cards for up to 90 days visa and mastercard extend such 
coverage to holders of their premium gold and platinum cards 
most standard homeowner or tenant policies provide limited 
coverage of valuables from a wide assortment of what insurers call 
perils which usually include theft fire or wind damage but 
not loss due to ones own negligence 
for example standard policies likely will insure all jewelry in 
your home including watches precious or semiprecious stones for 
a total of up to 1000 coverage for silver and goldware generally 
is capped at 2500 
consumers can get extra coverage by purchasing floaters or 
riders that are attached to their regular policies 
rates vary from state to state and even from one part of town 
to the next 
the average cost of insuring a piece of jewelry in south dakota 
for instance is 80 cents per 100 of appraised value insurance on 
that same item in brooklyn new york would cost 450 per 100 
but in nearby manhattan it costs around 130 according to the new 
yorkbased trade group insurance information institute 
insurance premiums also vary depending on whether the appraised 
pieces are classified as scheduled or unscheduled and 
whether the policy offers agreed value or actual cash value 
coverage said arlene lagrassa vice president of kornreich 
insurance services in new york 
scheduled coverage pays off on an item no matter how its lost 
but with unscheduled property collection is possible only if the 
item is stolen or destroyed in a fire she said 
agreed value coverage means that at the time of collection the 
insured will receive the full amount for which the item is insured 
while the actual cash value takes depreciation into account 
allowing the policyholder to collect a replacement of equal value 
or an amount that may be less than current market value she said 
neither however accounts for appreciation so a policyholder 
eventually could end up paying more to update coverage 
a sophisticated broker recognizes when diamonds or gold are 
changing in value and review schedules and policies with you 
said john karanik a senior vice president for atlantic mutual 
insurance co in new york 
but brobeck sees other alternatives one strategy that people 
might want to take is to spend the money they would have spent on 
insurance on improving their home security such as adding wall 
safes he said bank safe deposit boxes also are much cheaper

chase manhattan corps chairman says the 
enormous us trade deficit could be reduced if the united states 
forced foreign nations to essentially buy a dollar worth of us 
goods for each dollar worth they wanted to sell here 
in a speech prepared for delivery tuesday before the world trade 
council of orange county calif willard c butcher outlined a 
plan under which trade certificates would be issued to 
importers of usmade goods 
each certificate would be worth the value of the purchased 
goods he said 
foreigners shipping products into the united states would be 
required to supply the certificates having the face value of their 
goods butcher said the certificates also could trade on the open 
market 
butcher said the plan could be phased in over a fouryear 
period initially at ratios that reflect current trade imbalances 
for example he said foreign exporters initially might be required 
only to submit 75 or 80 worth of certificates in order to sell 
100 worth of goods to the united states with the ratio increasing 
over time 
he said his plan would not be a form of protectionism 
trade certificates would neither favor nor discriminate 
against any industry shipper product or country butcher said 
they would end up promoting trade since the more goods that are 
shipped from the united states the more that can be shipped to the 
united states 
the nations trade deficit totaled 2775 billion in the third 
quarter up slightly from 2755 billion in the previous quarter 
chase is the nations second largest bank holding company with 
assets of around 100 billion

the white house said today president bush has 
no plans to ask congress for more money to close failed savings and 
loan institutions despite his remark a day earlier that recent 
legislation may not provide enough 
its a whale of a mess and well see where we go bush said 
monday speaking to a group of editorial writers weve had this 
one refinancing i am now told that that might not be enough 
however bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
that the president was not signaling any effort on our part to 
come up with new legislation 
fitzwater said the presidents remarks were more of a suggestion 
that there was a shortterm budget crunch which would make it 
difficult for the government to close as many sampls as it needs to 
legislation signed aug 9 by bush authorized the government to 
borrow 50 billion through september 1991 to protect depositors at 
insolvent sampls a package larger than the rescues for the chrysler 
corp lockheed aircraft corp new york city and the marshall plan 
combined 
only four months after the bills been signed hes talking 
about more money thats pretty amazing said economist robert 
litan of the brookings institution 
bushs comment drew immediate criticism in congress where a key 
democrat said the administration wasnt effectively spending the 
money it already has provided 
i and others are not just going to throw money at this said 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house task force 
overseeing the sampl bailout 
we want to see some results he should use the harpoon in his 
hand rather than ask for more money hes had this bill for four 
months and quite frankly little has been done vento said 
private analysts have maintained for months even before the 
bailout bill passed congress that 50 billion was inadequate and 
that the administration would have to ask taxpayers for more 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp warned in october that it was possible the 50 billion would 
prove to be insufficient treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
said then that nothing had occurred since the bills passage to 
change the administrations estimate 
bushs statement is the first indication from him that the 
administration may be rethinking the adequacy of the original 
package 
the resolution trust corp the government agency charged with 
the bailout has taken over 313 sampls and is expecting to take over 
as many as 200 more 
the agency has spent 10 billion disposing of 33 institutions 
it hopes to recover some of the money by selling the real estate 
and loan portfolios of the institutions

toy trains which have chugged around so 
many christmas trees in years past are coming round again this 
year 
after being eclipsed by video games at the beginning of the 
decade sales are up for train sets according to manufacturers 
wholesalers and retailers 
some see it as a return to more traditional toys by both 
children and parents while others say buyers are attracted by such 
modern versions as remotecontrolled trains and sets featuring 
miniature video cameras 
our business is going crazy were so far behind with orders 
its unbelievable said ron moyer vice president at 
international hobby corp in philadelphia which distributes model 
trains accessories and building kits were working six days a 
week extra hours each day 
moyer estimates internationals sales are up 40 percent over 
last year 
a lot of people are bringing out their old train sets they had 
for years and theyre going to hobby stores to get the layouts 
going again he said 
orders also are up about 40 percent at bachman industries inc 
according to dick maddox vice president for sales and marketing 
bachman supplied by factories in china advised retailers this 
fall that political unrest there and a fire at a factory in 
thailand caused shipping delays 
but maddox says demand remains strong and we still havent 
hit the hottest time for train sales the last two weeks before 
christmas 
dan perkins national sales manager for global hobby 
distributors in fountain valley calif said he believes many 
people are buying trains at his hobby shack retail chain for the 
same reason he bought one 
you have a generation of children who grew up with trains who 
are now adults he said and they want trains for their kids 
plus the manufacturers are back in the swing again after a pretty 
bad shakeout a few years ago sales are up 20 to 30 percent over 
last year and last year was a growth year 
bachman took aim at a new market this year with its big 
hauler sets trains built to the extralarge g scale about 
twice the size of yesteryears toy trains 
maddox estimates his company will sell 15 million worth of the 
big trains this year and he thinks he had to turn away as much as 
10 million in orders 
it will never never replace ho scale trains as a hobby but it 
will become the standard for those who want to set up trains under 
the tree as part of the tradition he said little kids can 
play with it its big enough for them to handle it 
in moorestown nj manufacturer tyco also is having a banner 
year company spokesman bruce maguire said trains are doing well 
because of the same type of nostalgia buying that has made some of 
the companys dolls successful this year 
among the more popular dolls that are making comebacks are 
dolls that mothers had when they were girls he said they are 
now buying them for their kids 
prices of train sets vary widely advertising circulars for the 
toys r us chain last week showed train sets from 2499 to 
19999 serious hobbyists can spend hundreds of dollars on a 
single locomotive 
in general basic is what sells maguire said good old 
american train sets good old dolls theyre going to sell year in 
and year out kids stil want them and parents still want their kids 
to have them 
art peisner president of lionel said there are few reliable 
statistics for the industry but he believed sales were higher now 
than in decades lionel train sales are up significantly 
certainly doubledigit this year he said 
lionel which markets a locomotive equipped with a video camera 
has introduced oversize g gauge and collectororiented 
standard gauge trains but peisner says the companys biggest 
success remains the mass marketing of train sets complete with 
track and electric transformer 
the focus of our advertising is many adults what some people 
would refer to as yuppies who have children now of age who are 
potentially interested in trains peisner said 
were trying to remind them of the wonderful times they had 
when they were kids playing with their trains and more importantly 
playing with their fathers now were advising them to enjoy the 
experience from the other end with their sons or their 
daughters 
peisner estimates the train industrys share of the roughly 
125 billion retail toy market is about 300 million video games 
such as the popular nintendo account for several billion dollars on 
top of the overall market and peisner has no illusions that trains 
someday will take the lions share of the market 
no i think train sets are an important and growing set of the 
toy market but trains are not an everyday part of a kids life 
today they way they were back in the 50s he said

a lawsuit accusing the julien co of 
failing to meet a 435 million margin call on the new york cotton 
exchange claims the leading cotton merchant is in financial trouble 
julien hohenberg founder and president of the memphis company 
was unavailable for comment tuesday at his office or residence 
the lawsuit filed monday by painwebber inc says the julien 
co failed to meet the margin call on dec 8 one day after a 
similar call for 2 million 
painewebber said it froze the julien cos account but was left 
with a shortfall of 23 million 
the lawsuit follows last weeks sharp drop in cotton prices and 
market observers say that may have been partly caused by a major 
merchant selling holdings to meet a margin call 
until this past week the julien co has always been very 
prompt in satisfying margin calls said the lawsuit filed in 
shelby county chancery court 
brokers often allow a customer to trade on credit but if prices 
fall below the customers collateral he can be asked to meet that 
margin by coming up with additional money 
the shelby county court issued orders barring the julien co 
from disposing of its assets other than what is necessary in the 
ordinary course of business 
painewebber alleges upon information and belief that the 
julien co has recently incurred other substantial liabilities in 
addition to its liabilities to painewebber the lawsuit says 
industry observers say cotton prices have been low even though 
the nations cotton surplus is relatively small cutbacks in 
purchases by textile mills and a large domestic cotton crop this 
year may have attributed to that market sluggishness the observers 
say 
the julien co is a leading cotton merchant memphis has been a 
center of cotton trade since mississippi river paddlewheelers 
brought in cotton from plantations throughout the delta and julien 
hohenbergs family has been in the business since 1879 
his familys business hohenberg bros was sold to cargill 
inc in 1975 and became that companys cotton subsidiary 
hohenberg who had been president of the family business since 
1961 continued to run hohenberg bros until 1985 when he retired 
and formed the julien co

drexel burnham lambert incs economic forecast 
for 1990 is titled what if bear market and features a teddy 
bear on its cover not surprisingly the firm predicts a recession 
next year 
drexel is not alone pessimism is the new years message from 
wall street with major brokerages forecasting an economic downturn 
and some an outright recession 
in their annual yearahead forecasts the firms that engineer 
multibilliondollar deals and advise individual investors whether 
to buy stock in coke or pepsi arent in total agreement but none 
is optimistic 
the consensus view of wall streets seers is that slow economic 
growth a weak dollar overseas and slumping corporate profits will 
combine to retard the economy and the stock market at the start of 
the new decade 
after an eightyear run reflecting a sevenyear economic 
expansion my view is there aint much out there that is 
unexploited kidder peabody amp co chief investment strategist 
stefan abrams said weve had a long time to rotate everybody 
into one dance 
kidder predicts very slow economic growth in the range of 1 
percent but not a dictionary definition of a recession which 
is economic shrinkage the firms inflation estimates vary from 
just over 3 percent to over 4 percent on the low side of wall 
street expectations 
abrams said a key issue will be wage and employment pressures 
and that more job cuts such as the recent 10000 announced by ibm 
and more than 30000 expected at atampt could provoke a fullscale 
recession 
economists are in agreement about groups of stocks that will do 
well in 1990 growth companies in areas such as pharmaceuticals and 
beverages and recent fallen angels such as anheuserbusch cos 
inc or dun amp bradstreet corp 
abby joseph cohen drexels chief investment strategist 
predicts that corporate profits will decline to 2250 per share 
for the standard amp poors 500 stock index significantly lower than 
other firms predictions in the 25 range 
we believe that profits have already peaked and that consensus 
expectations are too high cohen writes in drexels 206page 
forecast released tuesday 
drexels recommendation buy stocks in companies whose earnings 
and revenues are not likely to be harmed by an economic slowdown or 
recession such as soft drinks the firm recommends pepsico over 
cocacola co pharmaceuticals such as pfizer inc and emerging 
industries such as biotechnologys genentech inc 
also contributing to a recession drexel says is a declining 
money flow due to factors such as bearish foreign sentiment on the 
dollar weakness in domestic demand for goods lower corporate 
profits and soft real estate prices merrill lynch amp co the 
largest wall street firm is slightly more sanguine we should 
escape a fullfledged recession but it may be a close call 
chief economist donald h straszheim wrote last week 
returns on stocks should be below average next year merrill 
predicted with a change in market leadership to capital goods and 
energy stocks from consumer and financial issues its 
recommendation companies offering growth potential 
painewebber inc chief economist edward m kerschner was the 
most chipper of his peers saying in a happy new year memo to 
staffers that before spring lower interest rates and the outlook 
for upturn in the economy could be fuel for the next leg of the 
bull market 
kerschner predicted the stock market could end 1990 10 percent 
to 15 percent higher than at the start 
he also sees interest rates heading lower next year with a 
prime rate falling to 9 percent from the current 105 percent but 
greg a smith investment strategist at prudentialbache securities 
inc throws water on a lower interest rate scenario with a 
positive economic outlook 
while the economy is showing some signs of softness 
particularly in auto sales and while capital spending is slowing 
i do not really see widespread weakness nor even that the weak 
areas are getting weaker he writes 
the rapidly changing political situation in the soviet union and 
eastern europe was a wild card cited by several economists the 
soviet union needs western technology to rebuild its economy they 
said and faster growth in poland east germany hungary and 
czechoslovakia could benefit the us economy 
some economists say bonds should benefit because lower us 
defense spending should reduce the federal deficit and therefore 
reduce interest rates while stocks should gain based on both lower 
interest rates and faster global growth 
its all very bullish for bonds and stocks as long as 
perestroika continues kerschner wrote referring to soviet 
political and economic restructuring

mixed tuesday in quiet trading on the chicago board of trade as 
players waited for any news of export sales 
corn futures were pressured by a weekly agriculture department 
report showing a lowerthanexpected amount of corn inspected for 
export last week

purchasing managers of the nations corporations 
think the economy will avoid a recession next year but optimism has 
ebbed to the lowest level since the early 1980s according to a 
forecast released thursday 
the economy will be weak in the first half of 1990 and improve 
during the remainder of the year producing moderate growth 
overall the national association of purchasing managements 
semiannual forecast said 
inflation will ease further next year and should finish this 
year milder than previously expected 
although a recession isnt forecast more corporate purchasing 
executives have indicated concern about economic conditions now 
than ever before in the 27 years hhe association has asked its 
members how they feel about the future 
and fewer purchasers are optimistic than at any time since 
september 1981 when the economy was struggling in a recession 
the exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in 
1990 is overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth albeit 
moderate said robert j bretz chairman of the associations 
business survey committee 
the basis for believing a recession will be averted and minor 
growth achieved is the view that both exports and capital 
expenditures will continue to be relatively strong against a 
backdrop of a sharply lower rate of inflation bretz said 
the threat of a recession or a severe slowdown heads the list of 
concerns expressed by the purchasing managers high labor and 
benefit costs were the second mostmentioned worry followed by 
rising interest rates 
corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they 
must make spending decisions based on such assumptions as how 
business will be how much inflation will erode buying power 
whether the cost of borrowing money will rise 
the associations forecast released at a news conference said 
64 percent of the members expect business to be better rather than 
worse in 1990 than in 1989 
economic growth will average 5 percent next year before 
adjusting for inflation with the second half of the year improving 
from a weak first six months rising capital expenditures 
expanding exports and slowing imports will contribute to the 
increase in economic output 
inflation will continue easing next year after registering lower 
readings than expected in 1989 the forecast indicated purchasers 
said their prices increased an average of 26 percent in 1989 down 
from the 37 percent increase originally predicted for the year and 
from the 5 percent reported for 1988 
next year prices were predicted to rise an average of just 16 
percent 
clearly this projects a continuing moderating trend in the 
rate of inflation bretz director of materials management at 
pitney bowes inc said at the news conference 
ample supplies and reduced demand are keeping inflation in 
check bretz said 
for the overall outlook for the next 12 months 64 percent of 
the purchasers expressed concern that was up from 57 percent when 
the last survey was taken in may and the highest proportion in the 
27 years the association has been asking its members to say whether 
they feel worriedpessimistic concerned or 
satisfiedoptimistic 
only 31 percent of the purchasers said they were satisfied or 
optimistic about next year down from 42 percent in may and 48 
percent a year ago that was the smallest percentage to express 
that view since september 1981 
the purchasers group gathers information for its semiannual 
reports from responses to questions put to purchasing executives in 
more than 300 industrial companies nationwide 
the tempe arizbased group also does monthly reports on 
business the november report showed the manufacturing side of the 
economy continued to decline for the seventh straight month

a sobbing leona helmsley was sentenced today to 
four years in prison and fined 71 million by a judge who said 
naked greed prompted her to evade income taxes by billing her 
hotel empire for personal items 
no person no matter how wealthy and prominent stands above 
the law said us district judge john m walker jr told the 
notoriously picky and sharptongued executive 
your conduct was a product of naked greed you believed you 
were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition walker 
said 
walker also imposed 750 hours of community service at hale 
house a home for infants born addicted to drugs three years 
probation and repayment of close to 2 million in unpaid taxes 
he ordered the 69yearold mrs helmsley who moments earlier 
tearfully pleaded for mercy to pay the costs incurred by the 
federal probe and prosecution of the charges walker allowed mrs 
helmsley to remain free on an unspecified bail pending appeal 
mrs helmsley her 80yearold husband harry seated three rows 
away was wracked with sobs as she told walker im more 
humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine 
i am guilty of a serious crime i feel like im in the middle 
of a nightmare she said 
mrs helmsley said she and her husband had been virtual 
prisoners in their home for the past three years and said the media 
had ripped open the grave of her late son during their coverage of 
the trial 
i beg you dont let me lose harry too she said sobbing 
her cheeks flushed and stained with tears our whole life has 
been work and each other please dont we have nothing else 
her attorney gerald feffer told walker earlier that his client 
had become a lightning rod for hate mail death threats and 
antisemitic remarks 
she has been ridiculed abused and humiliated in an 
unprecedented way having nothing to do with her wrongdoing 
feffer said 
two former helmsley executives were also sentenced codefendant 
joseph licari received 30 months in prison three years probation 
and a 75000 fine codefendant frank turco received a twoyear 
term three years probation and a 50000 fine 
mrs helmsley was found guilty of evading federal taxes from 
1983 through 1985 most of it by fraudulently billing 31 million 
in expenses from the helmsleys greenwich conn mansion dunellen 
hall to their 5 billion real estate empire 
among the expenses were more than 1 million for a pool 
enclosure with a marble dance floor jade figures worth 500000 
and a 130000 indooroutdoor sound system other personal expenses 
included groceries and 8 in underwear 
the helmsleys have extensive real estate holdings and own 27 
hotels helmsley was indicted along with his wife but found 
mentally incompetent to stand trial 
in magazine ads that are still published mrs helmsley is 
portrayed as the queen of the helmsley luxury hotels a regal 
perfectionist with an eagle eye for the slightest thing out of 
place 
in court she was depicted as an abusive pennypinching tyrant 
part of a defense strategy of arguing that the phony billing 
scheme was orchestrated by employees to avoid contact with mrs 
helmsley who was labeled by her own lawyer gerald feffer as a 
tough bitch 
according to testimony mrs helmsley ordered that bottles be 
returned for the nickel deposit and once told her housekeeper we 
dont pay taxes only the little people pay taxes 
feffer had argued the helmsleys did nothing wrong in billing 
their companies for part of their household expenses because they 
used the estate for business

the dollar and other currencies in both new york and europe the

the 1989 cotton crop is expected to be 
slightly less than 121 million bales down 22 percent from last 
years harvest but virtually the same as estimated in november the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
in its new estimate based on field conditions as of dec 1 the 
departments national agricultural statistics service said a 20 
percent drop in the acreage for harvest and slightly lower yields 
account for the decline from 1988 levels 
the delta states experienced favorable weather during harvest 
and show and increase from last month the report said in 
texas an october freeze lowered expected yields 
orange production was forecast at 194 million boxes unchanged 
from the previous forecast two months ago based on oct 1 
indications but 6 percent below last season 
this decline is due mostly to floridas 11 percent decrease 
from last season the report said freezing weather in florida 
during late february killed some of the open bloom and damaged new 
growth 
the report also indicated dry edible bean production this year 
at 241 million hundredweight up 25 percent from last years 
droughtreduced harvest but still 7 percent short of 1987 
production acreage for harvest was up 24 percent from last year 
kand the average yield at 1436 pounds per acre was up 1 percent 
burley tobacco production was estimated at 543 million pounds 
up 14 percent from 1988 but fractionally below the november 
forecast the area for harvest is up 13 percent from last year and 
the average yield is up 18 pounds per acre 
no new estimates were issued for the major field crops such as 
corn wheat and soybeans 
in a related report the departments world outlook board said 
prospective levels of cotton production and use in 1989 remain at 
near the levels indicated last month although production prospects 
are up on a few foreign countries 
this likely will mean reduced needs for us cotton in world 
markets and lower us export prospects the report said 
the global outlook for wheat is largely unchanged the 
november forecast the report said for corn sorghum oats and 
other socalled coarse grains 198990 production and inventories a 
year from now are expected to be down marginally from last months 
outlook 
larger output is forecast for canada eastern europe and 
australia the report said however these gains are more than 
offset by smaller crops in the sudan argentina mexico and several 
other countries

petroleum futures prices finished mixed tuesday 
with wholesale home heating oil rising as crude oil and gasoline 
declined 
energy market analysts said a late round of selling defused a 
rally that had carried the january crude oil contract near its 
highs

mondays gain of 058 cent but contracts for delivery during 
february through april fell by amounts ranging from 027 cent to 
068 cent 
the nearby heating oil contract gained support from cold weather

output of hydroelectric power 
among other refined products traded on the new york merc 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for january delivery which sank 025 
cent on monday dropped another 037 cent to 5203 cents a gallon

control data corp is seeking us 
government approval to sell the soviet union six mainframe 
computers that would be used to improve the safety of civilian 
nuclear power plants company officials said 
one of the computers would be installed at the site of the 1986 
nuclear accident in chernobyl the company said monday the cyber 
962 computers would be sold under a 32 million 1year contract 
the rule banning hightech exports to the soviet union recently 
was lifted computer sales to the soviets has been a touchy issue 
because of concerns by us officials that highpowered computers 
could be used for such military purposes as designing weapons 
the cyber 962 computer is about three years old and does not 
represent the latest technology said james ousley president of 
control datas computer products group it falls well below the 
performance level of supercomputers used by the united states to 
design nuclear weapons 
control data long has had business ties with the soviet union 
but it has not sold a machine there since 1978 it applied for an 
export license for the 32 million deal last month 
representatives of the commerce energy and defense departments 
and the nuclear regulatory commission are expected to rule on the 
request this spring 
the environment is much better for a sale of this type said 
ousley he said he expected commerce and energy department 
officials to be enthusiastic about the sale but said defense 
officials may express reservations 
control data would have to supply onsite inspection and build 
in safeguards to ensure that the mainframes would be used for the 
stated purpose ousley said

bell canada claims to be reaching goals for its 
alex videotex system here months ahead of schedule and is expanding 
to small business customers as well as preparing for a debut next 
year in toronto 
the twoyear pilot project offering interactive services in 
words and graphics through household terminals started a year ago 
with the target of 20000 customers in the montreal area 
its very easy to use sylvie bastien a bell canada 
spokeswoman said in offering a demonstration you dont need to 
be a computer expert 
bell canada had been issuing regular progress reports on the 
number of subscribers to alex that showed a slow start but steady 
rise in the projects early months the first weeks last december 
were plagued by distribution difficulties 
mrs bastien said the goal of 20000 residential customers was 
reached in june but the company will no longer release updates on 
the number of subscribers because it is valuable information for 
competitors 
bell canada operates primarily in quebec and ontario canadas 
two most populous provinces 
although videotex systems have had some spectacular failures in 
the united states they have been popular in other countries such 
as france where the minitel system is used extensively 
alex takes its name from alexander graham bell who emigrated to 
canada from scotland before inventing the telephone while teaching 
at a school for the deaf in boston 
the number of services available through alex does not approach 
the more than 10000 offered in france but mrs bastien said bell 
canada has been pleased with its progress in a new field 
from about 100 services available at the outset the number has 
risen steadily to 480 among the services offered in french and 
english are real estate listings market reports traffic 
information horoscopes home shopping and bill paying and news 
and weather 
you see how fast it goes mrs bastien said were very 
happy because we didnt even think we would reach 300 services in 
seven months 
about 60 percent of alexs customers rent the special terminal 
about the size of a small television set from bell canada for a 
monthly fee of 675 the others obtain the alex software to use 
the system through their personal computers 
the system plugs into any phone line 
the average monthly bill is about 34 mrs bastien said but a 
few customers have become addicted and run up higher bills than 
their budgets could sustain 
a clock runs on the screen showing how many minutes have been 
used up on any connection some services are free others run from 
5 cents to 38 cents per minute 
bell canada only rents the equipment the services are provided 
by other companies and the most popular are electronic mailboxes 
that mrs bastien described as pale pink its nothing obscene 
mrs bastien said alex was envisioned as being for residential 
customers but enough requests have come in from small businesses to 
prompt the expansion final rate approval from government 
regulators was pending on the plan 
bell canada has applied to expand to toronto canadas largest 
city and its financial center in april it also is seeking 
regulatory approval to change the formal status of alex from a 
twoyear trial to a continuing commercial service 
the canadian government was involved in developing the telidon 
videotex system that is the basis for alex it was turned over to 
private companies for further development

there are better ways to get publicity but a 
fight between homosexuals and christian fundamentalists 
nevertheless has called attention to the rapid growth of a home 
computer service owned by ibm and sears 
the prodigy service has expanded to a quartermillion 
subscribers in 160000 homes from 30000 homes a year ago it 
serves 21 of the nations largest markets up from six a year ago 
prodigy is a risky venture that still is losing money and might 
not catch on but analysts say it seems to stand a good chance 
because its formula appeals to the doityourself doitnow spirit 
in its target market of affluent american families 
if prodigy does succeed its backers will be sitting pretty 
numerous previous failures show the videotex market is costly and 
difficult to penetrate as it is prodigys expansion is taking a 
heavy investment by the nations biggest computer company and its 
biggest retailer 
i think prodigy has learned a lot from the people who have 
gone before theyre losing a ton of money thats in their 
business plan but its also in their business plan for this to 
catch on in a big big way said efrem sigel president of 
communications trends inc in larchmont ny 
prodigy allows people to bank shop trade stocks read news 
play games chat or teach themselves via their home computer it 
costs a flat 10 a month 
other home computer services such as compuserve genie bix and 
delphi charge by the hour and are more geared to true computer 
enthusiasts 
compuserve the nations biggest service with about 600000 
subscribers is trying to appeal to a broader audience by making 
its screens more uniform and its commands simpler to understand 
compuserve which is owned by the hampr block inc tax service 
already is profitable 
prodigys adverse publicity came in the past week after it 
canceled a chat service named health spa an electronic bulletin 
board that allowed subscribers to post notices or communicate on 
healthrelated issues 
prodigy said health spa was canceled because of low usage but 
some subscribers said it was because one section of health spa had 
turned into a forum for a heated debate on homosexuality between 
gays and fundamentalist christians 
dozens of subscribers have been demanding the return of health 
spa an unintentional testament to the popularity of prodigys 
services 
chatting on bulletin boards such as health spa is more 
popular than anyone at prodigy had predicted but it is a small 
part of the service in comparison to services such as banking and 
shopping 
more americans became doityourselfers in the 1980s with the 
proliferation of automated teller machines mailorder catalogs and 
selfservice gasoline stations 
prodigy is aimed at upperincome people with home computers who 
want to do things themselves for reasons of convenience variety 
and control 
one such person is jonathan beacher a traveling consultant to 
television stations beacher who lives in the atlanta area says 
he saved 2500 on airline fares in the first three or four months 
by booking flights himself he also pays bills through the bank by 
computer while his wife orders groceries and his children chat 
with friends play video games and use the encyclopedia 
to beacher prodigy is a little like a microwave oven its 
hard to imagine life without it 
before we had a microwave oven here we thought oh my gosh 
the food will taste terrible but you end up doing whole new kinds 
of cooking 
complaints about prodigy range from its relative slowness the 
fancy userfriendly graphics are a drag on the computer to 
questions about its usefulness 
many people still would rather get news from newspapers weather 
from television and groceries from a trip to the supermarket 
computer phobia is prevalent and even people who use computers at 
work may not be enthusiastic about using them at home 
aware of the difficulties american telephone amp telegraph co 
seems to be steering clear of videotex even though it was freed to 
enter the arena by a federal judges order in july 
videotex is sort of the most glamorous but also the most 
expensive way to get into electronic publishing said atampt 
spokesman michael keady noting that many companies have failed in 
it spokesman jim byrnes called it a technology in search of a 
market indicating atampt might be more likely to get into 
audiotex which involves voice messages 
ray lamadeleine a commercial real estate agent in glendale 
calif said prodigy is establishing a position for itself that 
will be hard to dislodge if videotex does catch on as 
international business machines corp and sears roebuck amp co are 
betting it will 
others who try to climb in and start from scratch they better 
be prepared to sped the same kind of bucks because i dont think 
theres any cheaper way to do it lamadeleine said 
prodigy will not comment on how much it has spent or when it 
hopes to turn a profit 
suffice it to say that it is a longterm business 
proposition said prodigy spokesman brian ek

cars to compete in the same market as the mazda rx7 and the nissan 
300zx no price has been set forthe car which goes on sale in 
october 
he also said chrysler production planners forecast the company 
will hold its 138 percent share of the us car and light truck 
market in 1990 as sales for the entire industry tumble to about 
142 million vehicles

banks reopened tuesday after a 
24hour holiday ordered by the government when it devalued the 
austral by 345 percent 
but the devaluation intended to narrow the gap between 
argentinas official and free market currency rates had little 
immediate success as the gap widened 23 percent by days end 
meanwhile the government disclosed the last part of its 
economic adjustment plan would include hikes in statecontrolled 
prices of public services 
when financial institutions opened the austral sold for about 
1000 for every us dollar the official rate set sunday night 
when the government hiked gasoline prices by about 60 percent 
when markets closed foreign exchange houses offered dollars for 
1230 australs apiece 
the gap between the official and free market rates led to the 
devaluation the second in five months 
businessmen in general favored the changes which they said were 
necessary for economic stability nevertheless some insisted the 
government of president carlos menem make deeper cuts in state 
spending and speed up the program of privatizations and 
deregulation 
groups representing the important agricultural industry which 
has withheld from the central bank the dollars earned from overseas 
sales of beef and grain criticized the government for increasing 
export taxes at the same time it devalued the austral 
farmers stood to reap windfall gains from the devaluation which 
would have put more australs in their pockets from every dollar 
they turned in export taxes a major source of government revenue 
were increased by about 11 percent 
starting wednesday the cheapest bus ticket will rise 86 percent 
to 130 australs while domestic plane fares will cost 62 percent 
more 
president menem defended the measures saying the goal is to 
achieve the stability of the economy 
of course there may be protests but it is the only way out 
for argentina which is emerging little by little from a sad 
situation of inflation and hyperinflation menem told reporters 
thus far the changes had not prompted any protests by 
argentines officials said

swissbased cibageigy ltd says it 
wants to sell spectraphysics corp the worlds largest maker of 
lasers and a company cibageigy won just two years ago in a 
takeover fight 
spectraphysics a leading manufacturer of the scanners that 
read bar codes in groceries and retail stores is likely to benefit 
from new ownership willing to invest more in the company a 
spokesman for cibageigy and analysts said tuesday 
but the announcement was met by stinging criticism from san 
josebased spectraphysics founder and former president herbert 
m dwight jr who left last year to head superconductor 
technologies inc of santa barbara 
its just a tragedy that spectraphysics could fall prey to a 
hostile takeover from a company that doesnt have the stomach to 
make the investments needed to expand dwight said 
cibageigy a 12 billionayear company plans to focus on its 
core businesses in drugs agriculture and chemicals and reduce its 
involvement in electronics chairman alex krauer said 
but sam isaly a pharmaceutical industry analyst with the firm 
mehta amp isaly in new york speculated the real reason for the 
reversal was is a combination of several developments 
there was a change in top management at ciba since the 
interest in spectraphysics was first taken he said the new 
fellows completed the purchase for 227 million but that was 
pretty much put in place by their predecessors 
the new management has a somewhat different vision of the 
company isaly said 
the old management wanted to diversify isaly said partly 
because the outlook for their core businesses was tenuous 
earlier in the 1980s with few new products now those businesses 
are picking up and the outlook for new products is good 
so the improving outlook for core businesses plus the change 
in management led them to reconsider staying in the kind of 
businesses spectraphysics is in he said 
in addition to divesting spectraphysics by mid1990 cibageigy 
plans to sell swissbased gretag an electronics and photofinishing 
equipment maker and a 37 percent stake in 3d systems a maker of 
stereolithography technology 
cibageigy plans to retain its mettlertoledo unit a 625 
millionayear maker of electronic weighing equipment because that 
company can sustain itself without further investments a spokesman 
said 
no price tag has been set on the companies for sale but isaly 
said spectraphysics might be worth about 300 million 
ciba with 900 million in profits last year had plenty of 
money to invest but apparently didnt want to commit large sums to 
spectraphysics research and product development isaly said 
along with bar code scanners spectraphysics makes medical 
instruments graphics equipment and measuring devices including a 
fingerprint detector so sensitive it can see prints inside of 
gloves 
spectraphysics is a very fastgrowing business that requires 
substantial investments to sustain the continued growth said 
ciba spokesman tom chizmadia it wasnt a matter of not being 
able to meet that it was just more of a strategic shift 
the sale has nothing to do with spectraphysics profitability 
chizmadia said since 1987 sales have grown about 16 percent a 
year to 296 million in 1988 and an expected 327 million this 
year and the company has been profitable every quarter 
cibageigy took over spectraphysics in 1987 after a sixmonth 
battle with reliance financial services corp which is controlled 
by takeover specialist saul steinberg 
krauer said one of cibageigys primary objectives is to find 
the right home for spectraphysics 
because we intend to sell spectraphysics in its entirety to a 
company with a longterm strategic commitment to the electronics 
industry the sale should have no adverse impact on spectraphysics 
employees he said in fact the sale should create new growth 
opportunities for employees 
the company has 3100 employees worldwide

with sales of 6114 million a year earlier when the company had a 
loss of 194 million

year 
allied and federated are based in cincinnati while the parent 
company has its headquarters in toronto

emerson electric co a major producer of 
electric motors on tuesday purchased leroysomer sa europes top 
maker of electric motors for 460 million 
industry analysts said the acquisition could make emerson the 
worlds leading manufacturer of electric motors 
my guess is this puts emerson over the top probably by a 
decent margin said kent newcomb an industry analyst for ag 
edwards in st louis relative to what the company was making 
the price looks pretty high but its a strategic acquisition and 
its probably cheaper than putting up the brick and mortars from 
scratch 
in addition to acquiring leroysomer of france the st 
louisbased company also announced the 135 million purchase of 
mcgill manufacturing co a valparaiso ind company that makes 
bearings and electrical products 
aside from prepared statements announcing the acquisitions 
company officials were unavailable for comment 
emerson which is also a leading producer of industrial 
monitoring equipment tools and components for appliances had 
annual sales of 71 billion in 1989 the company had operations in 
15 countries in 1988 
craig krapf an analyst for edward d jones amp co in st louis 
said the acquisition of leroysommer is in line with emersons 
growth strategy in the last six years 
emerson has done a fantastic job of improving profitability at 
smaller firms krapf said theyve got a knack for that 
the leroysomer acquisition which is subject to us and french 
regulatory approval gives emerson a chance to increase its 
presence in the european economic community before 1992 when the 
12nation bloc becomes a single unified market 
in addition to its us divisions emerson has some electric 
motor divisions in japan canada and mexico 
leroysomer is a manufacturer of integral and fractional 
horsepower electric motors and drives for industrial markets with 
manufacturing facilities primarily in france 
emerson said when the deal is completed it will sell 
leroysomers king bearing unit which is based in the united 
states 
mcgill the largest employer in valparaiso makes bearings and 
electrical products primarily for industrial uses 
the acquisition adds a premier brand name to emersons power 
transmission business and mcgills electrical products are a nice 
complement to the products of our other divisions said jim orso 
a spokesman for emersons public relations firm fleishmanhillard

jmb realty corp reportedly is bidding for 
bloomingdales department stores and hilton hotels corp and an 
industry analyst said tuesday both properties would mesh with the 
international firms expansion strategy 
jmb a real estate investment management and development firm 
is one of at least six bidders for all or part of hilton which 
went on the market in may the wall street journal reported in 
tuesdays editions 
the chicago tribune reported that jmb which owns a glitzy 
downtown mall anchored by bloomingdales chicago store is among 
several bidders for the 17store chain 
burton glazov jmbs executive director declined to comment on 
the reports 
neither potential acquisition would be a first for jmb which 
owns the liberty house retail chain in hawaii and several hotels 
including the ritz carlton and four seasons in chicago and the 
century plaza in los angeles glazov said 
a spokeswoman for torontobased campeau corp bloomingdales 
parent declined comment tuesday on the reports 
hilton does not expect any deal to close before the end of this 
year said william lebo jr general counsel for the beverly hills 
califbased company he declined to comment on the bidding or the 
journal story 
in a statement issued friday the deadline for bloomingdales 
bids campeau said it had received a number of expressions of 
interest from parties seeking to acquire the 17store chain the 
statement said details are confidential and that campeau would not 
further discuss the first stage of the sale 
campeau has said it expects to pare the list of prospective 
buyers to no more than five or six finalists who will receive 
more detailed information in preparation for the sale expected to 
be completed by february 
the sale price has been estimated at between 1 billion and 13 
billion 
jmb is a privately held corporation with holdings in chicago and 
other major us and canadian cities are worth more than 21 
billion said spokesman dennis waite 
a connection has existed for a while between jmb and 
bloomingdales in that there was a joint venture with federated 
department stores in developing shopping centers and 
bloomingdales was anchor in some of those malls waite said by 
telephone tuesday 
bloomingdales is part of the federated chain acquired by 
campeau in 1988 jmb acquired federateds shopping 
centerdevelopment arm in 1984 
waite also declined to comment on the reported bids 
louis masotti a professor of management and urban development 
at northwestern university said he had not heard about jmbs 
reported interest in the two highprofile properties but added 
i wouldnt be surprised if theyre true 
there isnt anything for sale that they dont try to buy 
masotti said in a telephone interview tuesday 
they seem to be targeting the name brands that dont require a 
great deal of advertising to put them in contention for national 
markets but do require a certain amount of capital and management 
skills both of which jmb seems to have in abundance he said 
the journal reported monday that besides jmb other bidders for 
bloomingdales are bahrainbased investment bank investcorp 
international bloomingdales chairman marvin traub and ann taylor 
inc chairman joseph brooks 
other possible bidders include such established retail companies 
as minneapolisbased dayton hudson corp and may co of st louis 
which have declined comment on their possible interest in the 
chain the tribune said

bear stearns amp co said tuesday it was resuming 
limited computerized program trading but it promised to follow 
several standards aimed at reducing market volatility 
the company is the first among the major wall street firms to 
resume index arbitrage trades for its own account several 
brokerages abandoned such activity last month amid criticism it was 
dangerously distorting the stock market and scaring away small 
investors 
the move prompted criticism in washington where legislation 
that would allow the securities and exchange commission to restrict 
program trading was introduced before congress 
bear stearns statement today shows why voluntary measures 
restraining program trading dont work said rep edward markey 
dmass chairman of a house committee that investigated the 
effects of program trading this past fall 
its like making red lights optional its too much to ask 
traders to refrain on a voluntary basis from making money i 
believe their actions make the perfect case for the passage of 
legislation which grants the sec the authority to prohibit or 
constrain manipulative or abusive trading practices which led to 
artificial volatility he added 
bear stearns said it would abandon all index arbitrage if the 
dow jones industrial average is down 50 points it also promised to 
adhere to industry guidelines in observance of all trading halts 
or circuit breakers during wild price swings in the market 
in addition bear stearns said it would follow the socalled 
uptick rule which was enacted to control excesses in short selling 
of individual stocks short sellers borrow shares then immediately 
sell them for cash because they expect the price of a stock to 
plummet the short seller makes a profit by buying the replacement 
shares at the lower price 
index arbitrage involves stockindex futures or contracts to 
buy and sell baskets of stocks based on particular indexes like the 
standard amp poors 500 index these contracts have come to represent 
a bigger market than that of common stocks albeit with higher 
stakes 
using computer programs traders seek to capitalize on brief and 
minute differences in prices of stocks and stockindex futures by 
buying or selling stocks with opposite trades in the futures

pratt amp whitney of canada ltd has agreed in 
a 6 million court settlement to warn aircraft owners that one of 
its engines could suddenly idle causing the plane to crash if the 
engine is not equipped with a special filter an aviation attorney 
announced tuesday 
the agreement was reached friday in us district court a day 
after a jury awarded compensatory damages to the family of a man 
who died in a 1985 new jersey air crash attorney arthur alan wolk 
said 
wolk said the settlement came while the jury deliberated whether 
to award punitive damages 
the jury found pratt amp whitney liable for the death of matthew 
macario 29 of coatesville pa who died feb 1 1985 when the 
beechcraft king air he was piloting crashed on approach to the 
millville nj airport copilot donald burns 58 of yardley 
pa also died 
the settlement requires the smallengine manufacturer to issue 
an urgent service bulletin advising aircraft owners that pratt 
amp whitney pt6 engines without a special filter could suddenly roll 
the engine back to idle and contribute to or cause a crash wolk 
said 
the bulletin will advise owners of the availability of p3 line 
filters that can reduce the possibility of fuel control unit 
contamination which causes the rollbacks he said 
a spokeswoman for pratt amp whitney louise boutin said the 
company had no immediate comment on the settlement she said the 
company has made the engine since 1963 but she had no estimate on 
the number produced 
the attorney for pratt amp whitney grant mccabe was ill tuesday 
and could not be reached for comment his assistant in the case 
lawrence wright refused to comment 
if this service bulletin saves just one life the time effort 
and cost of the trial will be worth it said wolk 
wolk claimed that pratt amp whitney knew about the potential 
problems in its engines without filters since 1973 he said some 
beechcraft aircraft but not all have the filter installed in 
their engines

the head of a group of personal computer users in 
london warned computer users tuesday night to steer clear of a 
mailed disk purporting to give information on aids because it could 
be part of a sabotage plot 
dr alan solomon who also heads a british company called s and 
s specializing in the examination of computer viruses said several 
thousand of the disks had been mailed to legitimate computer users 
users addresses had apparently been taken from computer 
magazines said solomon chairman of the ibm personal computer 
users group 
he said the aids information introductory diskette as the 
computer disk is called was so far not thought to contain an 
actual computer virus which attacks individual systems 
but he said it had been identified as a potential preparatory 
sabotage device known to computer experts as a trojan the full 
effects of which are not yet known 
solomon said he received one of the disks in the mail on monday 
bearing a panama postal box address he said he feared more could 
arrive in the mail this week 
there is no urgent panic in the short term but if it has 
already been installed i would advise them computer users to seek 
urgent help because it is a nasty thing he said 
a letter accompanying the disk asks for payment of 189 for one 
type of license and 378 for another he said 
solomon said few experienced computer users would risk 
installing an unsolicited disk without first checking it but that 
some less experienced users might

warmed by the thaw in eastwest 
relations the city council on tuesday unanimously voted to repeal 
a local ban on russian vodka imposed in 1983 after a korean 
passenger jet was shot down by the soviets 
mayor paul ackland said the city would write a letter to the 
soviet embassy to inform them of the action 
we want them to know that we as a community support the 
changes being made ackland said and hope our relationship 
will continue to improve 
he said the city would send a gift of goods made in hutchinson 
as a token of friendship 
michael carls the council member who introduced the ban six 
years ago said it was also his idea to lift it 
its not a stunt we take it seriously said carls who 
teaches american government to high school students in the town of 
10000 about 45 miles west of minneapolis 
it was first outrage over their denial of life to those 
passengers on the jet and today its a feeling of pleasure over the 
extent of democratization over there he said 
carls said other us cities with municipal control over liquor 
sales banned soviet vodka from store shelves after korean air lines 
flight 007 was shot down off sakhalin island in september 1983 all 
269 people including 61 americans were killed 
the jet was shot down on a flight from anchorage to seoul after 
it strayed into soviet airspace 
jeannette matheny a clerk at hutchinson municipal liquor store 
said the ban created some discussion in 1983 but since then she 
said its been forgotten 
i dont even think most of the public was aware of the ban 
matheny said i understand that we will restock the vodka but it 
wont be an extensive line one or two brands at the most 
carls said there were no plans for a ceremonial sip of the 
libation at the city council meeting 
it will be adopted without opposition and without much 
discussion he said we just dont want the events in eastern 
europe to go by without expressing our pleasure at whats going

duramed pharmaceuticals inc has recalled 
batches of its estrogen therapy tablets after tests showed 
variances in their uniformity 
the drug company said the differences in the 10 batches of 
tablets wouldnt alter the therapeutic value of the drug sold as 
conjugated estrogens 
estrogen is sold as a synthetic form of the female hormone and 
often is prescribed for women who have undergone hysterectomies or 
who have entered menopause 
the batches being recalled were produced in 1988 the company 
told the cincinnati enquirer in a report published tuesday it was 
unlikely many tablets remained because the product has a twoyear 
shelf life the company said 
telephone messages left at company headquarters in cincinnati 
were not returned tuesday 
in a statement duramed said it could not assess the financial 
impact of the uniformity issue and the product recall but said 
they were likely to have a material adverse effect 
nevertheless the company is confident that it has adequate 
resources to continue its business plan to develop and introduce 
new products the statement said 
duramed manufactures and sells generic drug products of various 
dosages of prescription drugs 
an analysis is under way to determine if production should be 
halted the company said until it is completed more recalls are 
possible and under certain circumstances the company may suspend 
production of the current formulation of the product duramed said

in a decision that could fatten state 
coffers by millions of dollars the state supreme court ruled 
tuesday that connecticut companies should not have written off 
commissions they paid to their international sales subsidiaries 
in the unanimous decision the high court said the state tax 
code did not allow manufacturing companies to deduct the 
commissions they paid to their domestic international sales 
corporations or discs from state corporation income taxes from 
1981 to 1984 
richard d nicholson legal director of the department of 
revenue services said the ruling is worth at least 3 million to 
the state he said the state knows of about 15 million in taxes 
deducted as commissions another 15 million collected by the 
state was in effect frozen in state accounts until the high court 
made its decision he said 
nicholson said using discs which allowed federal tax 
writeoffs was a common business practice between 1972 and 1984 
several connecticut companies believed they were eligible for 
similar state writeoffs in 1981 when the states tax code changed 
he said 
nicholson said the ruling could affect numerous connecticut 
companies who may find themselves owing the state money 
he also said the connecticut supreme court ruling could prove 
precedentsetting elswhere although he did not know how many other 
states face similar cases 
the connecticut decision knocked down a challenge raised by bolt 
technology corp a norwalkbased maker of seismic sound source 
systems olin corporation inc a stamfordbased chemical company 
and perkinelmer corp a norwalkbased optical instrument and lens 
maker 
olin and perkinelmer owe about 12 million in taxes because of 
the high courts ruling nicholson said bolt technology had paid 
115000 in taxes on the commission but that payment had been put 
on hold pending the outcome of the court case he said 
there were about 15 other pending cases on the matter said 
phyllis tarizek spokewoman for the state department of revenue 
services 
not only will we have the millions of dollars that were put on 
hold we are not going to lose a lot of money we brought in that 
was a big concern were happy tarizek said 
timothy f bannon commissioner of revenue services said im 
delighted but not surprised to be vindicated by the state supreme 
court 
the federal tax code from 1972 through 1984 allowed companies 
to create discs as a way to encourage foreign sales nicholson 
said the companies set up the subsidiaries to lease or sell goods 
in another country in turn the companies with discs were eligible 
for federal tax breaks 
under the state tax code revised in 1981 connecticut allowed 
companies to write off dividends from their state corporation 
income taxes but the state said companies had to pay taxes on 
expenses related to their dividends 
the high court agreed with the state claim that the discs were 
expenses related to dividends and therefore subject to state 
taxes nicholson said 
of course im disappointed that the court took the contrary 
opinion said george g vest the stamfordbased attorney for 
olin and perkinelmer corporations

the administration may lift bans on normal 
commercial exports to china including satellites that nation 
would launch after reviewing sanctions imposed after the violent 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators the white house said 
tuesday 
no decision has been made but it is possible 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
the administration is specifically looking at three hughes 
aircraft communication satellites one due for launch by china in 
april and the others in 1991 and 1992 that were held up by bushs 
ban on export of weapons and satellites to china last june 
two of the satellites are being built for australia and an 
australian official said tuesday we basically get a positive 
sense from talks with the state department on the possibility of 
quick approval 
roger uren political counselor at the australian embassy said 
weve made it clear this is important to us we have a sense the 
americans understand 
the administration suspended the export of all items on our 
munitions list which includes satellites and other items that are 
not weapons fitzwater said after the chinese killing of 
hundreds of demonstrators last spring 
we recognize that some items captured in the suspension here 
have civilian applications and fall under the category of normal 
commercial exports he said 
he said the administration is reviewing these exports but has 
not reached any decision on granting waivers so that they may 
proceed 
bush has encountered stiff criticism for opening the door for 
renewed relations with china in the face of that nations continued 
actions against political dissent and in light of its record on 
human rights 
meanwhile a bush administration official disclosed to the 
associated press that a third administration official white house 
personnel director chase untermeyer had gone to beijing on the 
administrations mission to china last weekend 
the official did not say why untermeyer went the washington 
post said in wednesday editions he visited two chinese friends of 
bush a former ambassador to china for their assessments of the 
situation there 
rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of house foreign policy 
subcommittee on international economic policy and trade said 
tuesday after fitzwaters comments i suppose it shouldnt 
surprise me after watching the administration fly to china without 
any change 
in china where the government has only tightened the screws 
the bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to 
try to do to help the chinese government gejdenson said it 
makes no sense whatsoever 
in addition house democrats announced plans for a quick vote to 
try to override president bushs veto of a bill aiding chinese 
students in this country 
the vetoed bill sponsored by rep nancy pelosi of california 
would permit chinese students to remain in the unite states 
indefinitely if they fear retaliation at home bush says he is 
accomplishing the same thing by executive order 
the administration already has allowed progress on some 
uschina commerce since imposing the sactions that not only 
covered military items but nuclear supplies and any loans to china 
from the world bank and the asia development bank 
bush said monday that the sanctions remain in place even though 
he sent two emissaries national security adviser brent scowcroft 
and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to china over 
the weekend and thus put an end to the suspension of highlevel 
contacts between the two nations 
fitzwater reiterated tuesday the presidents sentiment that 
china needs to take certain actions to indicate a change in its 
repressive policies before relations can be normalized 
since the sanctions were imposed the us government has 
allowed export of four boeing jetliners worth 650 million with 
guidance systems that were on the us munitions control list of 
sensitive technology 
in addition chinese engineers have been allowed to return to 
work in the united states on a 500 million program to upgrade 
chinese f8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronics 
equipment the white house said no planes were to be delivered in 
keeping with the export ban 
there has been no change in the deferral of 957 million in 
world bank loans and 336 million in asian development bank loans 
said fitzwater 
two of the satellites in question are being built by hughes 
under a 300 million contract with australia which is using a 
chinese launch vehicle and are due for launch in 1991 and 1992 
said hughes spokesman don oneal in a telephone interview from los 
angeles the third is a sixyearold westar satellite being 
refurbished by hughes for asiasat a britishchinese consortium 
also using a chinese launch vehicle to put the satellite in orbit 
next april 
fitzwater said hughes has told the administration it needs a 
decision relatively soon in order to meet the manufacturing and 
delivery timetables and allow the launches to proceed on schedule 
the boeing planes among 11 aircraft the contractor had on order 
to chinese commercial airlines were to be delivered in june said 
boeing spokesman randy harrison 
bushs sanctions were to suspend their delivery unless and until 
the state department and commerce department agreed with boeings 
appeal that the navigation device in question was for civilian 
application and could not be removed for military use without being 
obvious harrison said 
the government arms sales that have been suspended by the 
sanctions include a largely completed largecaliber artillery 
manufacturing modernization program worth 28 million 62 million 
worth of artillerylocating radar and 10 million worth of 
surfacelaunched antisubmarine torpedoes 
the administration is permitting subsidies for grain sales to 
china announcing on dec 5 that china was eligible to buy an 
additional one million metric tons of wheat using export 
enhancement program subsidies 
the chinese had used up almost all of their previous eep 
allocation a twomillionton promise made when bush visited china 
last february nearly half the sales under that allocation have 
been made since the tiananmen square massacre
