germany reached the top level friday with the announcement of 
criminal charges against former communist party chief erich 
honecker and five of his ousted lieutenants 
four of the disgraced former politburo members were thrown in 
jail pending an investigation honecker who underwent gall bladder 
surgery last summer was too ill to be jailed and remained under 
house arrest prosecutors said 
after decades of hearing their leaders say the west was poised 
to plunder the communist nation shocked east germans have grown 
increasingly angry as they have learned the extent of the 
plundering from within 
during a parliament session dec 1 one lawmaker alleged former 
officials stashed 54 billion in swiss bank accounts 
prosecutors have not confirmed that figure but there have been 
nearly daily revelations of corruption and lavish living by the 
countrys former hardline leaders 
the latest comes with the opening of criminal investigations 
against honecker 77 former premier willi stoph 75 and four 
aging cronies 
four of the six former politburo members already are in prison 
said prosecution spokesman peter przybylski former politburo 
member hermann axen 73 was having an eye operation in moscow 
they are accused of damaging the economy of the german 
democratic republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuse 
of office and corruption przybylski said 
the charges carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison 
those arrested were stoph guenther kleiber 58 werner 
krolikowski 65 and erich mielke the 81yearold former chief of 
the oncedreaded secret police 
przybylski did not say when the trials would take place adding 
that police had searched the suspects homes he also did not 
specify their alleged crimes 
for weeks officials have been disclosing how the ousted 
leadership lived lavishly with the best imported goods and had 
fancy hunting lodges while the staterun news media has spoken of 
fortunes smuggled abroad 
honecker and other former politburo members already were under 
house arrest in their exclusive compound outside east berlin 
honecker was ousted as party leader on oct 18 and all were later

say he may have embezzled 
his deputy manfred seidel was arrested and charged with 
smuggling out 110 million another figure connected to the scandal 
has committed suicide the official news agency adn said 
the allegations are particularly embarrassing for a country that 
routinely has said it is short of desperately needed western 
currency 
also friday the christian democrats said investigators had 
found the partys former leader gerald goetting responsible for 
financial irregularities the allegations were turned over to 
prosecutors for possible criminal charges

a research panel has exposed 50 
paintings as falsely attributed to rembrandt van rijn the 
17thcentury dutch master the group announced friday 
among the exposed paintings are a 1637 portrait of rembrandt on 
display in the nortonsimon museum in pasadena calif and the 
1635 landscape with carriage owned by the wallace collection 
in london 
the nortonsimon museum acquired the portrait which the panel 
attributes to rembrandt contemporary carel fabritius for about 
38 million in 1969 the amsterdam newspaper het parool reported 
a spokeswoman with the nortonsimon museum said the museum was 
unshaken by the finding and the portrait would remain on exhibit 
we are going to leave the rembrandt on display we dont 
endorse the methods of the research project said vicky rogers 
reading from a prepared statement attributions of works to 
rembrandt have been debated over 300 years this is another chapter 
in that ongoing debate 
well let history be the judge 
the authoritative rembrandt research group published its third 
of five volumes friday the series is looking at all 500 to 600 
works attributed to rembrandt 
of 100 paintings examined in volume 3 about 50 percent are 
not genuine rembrandts said panel member jozua bruin 
the outcome of volume 3 reflects the 50 percent score in the 
first two volumes bruin said in those volumes roughly 100 
paintings were branded as wrongly attributed to rembrandt 
the third volume in which rembrandts monumental night 
watch has gotten the stamp of approval was published friday the 
first and second volumes were published in 1982 and 1986 
respectively 
most of the falsely attributed works were probably painted by 
rembrandt students or paid assistants in his workshop according to 
bruin 
the panel which is subsidized by the dutch government began 
its work 21 years ago it scrutinizes each work with a close 
analysis of the paint the cloth or wood on which it is painted 
and ultimately the painting style according to bruin 
born in 1606 rembrandt was a prolific painter whose innovative 
use of light made him one of the outstanding representatives of the 
17thcentury dutch school he died in 1669 at age 63 
the rembrandt research group has drawn criticism from other art 
historians who have accused it of basing some of its conclusions 
on shaky scientific grounds 
its only natural that a project of such magnitude provokes 
scientific criticism bruin said but of course rembrandt is a 
special cause think of the financial interests involved 
he said its not clear when the project will be finished

despite their reputation for high standards so 
many japanese cars have been recalled to repair defects this year 
that the government has given automakers an unusual warning to keep 
a closer eye on quality 
the transport ministry issued the warning thursday at a 
bimonthly meeting with executives of the japan automobile 
manufacturers association following a recall of toyotas new luxury 
lexus cars in the united states this week 
its unusual for us to make such a warning said a transport 
ministry official but there were problems that we couldnt 
ignore this time 
since foreign automakers make such recalls more often 
toyotas lexus case wouldnt damage the companys image that much 
i hope he added 
toyota recalled all 8000 of its lexus ls400 luxury automobiles 
in the united states it is working to limit the damage to its 
image caused by the recall of the 35000 car that went on sale 
three months ago to try to cut into the shares of mercedes benz 
bmw and others in the us luxury car market 
the warning on quality control was given to representatives of 
nissan and honda the current executives in the automakers 
association and they were expected to pass it along to other 
companies said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
when asked about the warning the manufacturers association 
said we have nothing to say as long as each company uses a 
recall system in line with the transport ministrys guidance 
since september recalls in japan have involved nissan motor 
cos silvia bluebird and 180sx models daihatsu motor cos 
charade and applause and eight toyota models in each case poor 
quality in auto parts caused malfunctions shortly after the new 
cars hit the streets 
on dec 1 toyotas subsidiary in the united states recalled the 
lexus voluntarily after defects were found in the cruisecontrol 
mechanism and the brake light in the rear window it also said an 
alternator cable that connects to the battery would be checked the 
cars had been produced between may and october said shuji okabe a 
company spokesman 
he said toyota had notified the us government about the 
defects 
fumio matsuda spokesman for the japan automobile consumer 
union said the officially reported cases are only the tip of the 
iceberg 
he said there had been no decline in japanese technology but 
frequent model changes allow automakers little time to check the 
quality of new cars 
recalls are the result of overwhelming competition matsuda 
said 
he also said the transport ministry has loose rules concerning 
defects contributing to persistent quality problems 
the ministry does not require automakers to report defects and 
recall cars until they find out causes and remedies 
in september the ministry warned toyota for delaying too long 
in recalling 200000 cars in japan to repair an engine problem 
toyota spokesman hiroshi hashimoto said the malfunctions had not 
always appeared when the cars were tested but he conceded it 
took us too long to decide whether we should handle the defect as a 
recall or to repair the cars individually as a service to 
customers 
in october nissan recalled nearly 38000 cars in japan which 
cost the company 6 million a nissan official said the problem 
was a lack of durability in a flywheel part of the clutch 
mechanism in manualtransmission cars he said 
nissans 240sx model the us version of the silvia had no 
problem because it has a different engine he said 
daihatsu recalled its new charade and applause compact models in 
november due to brake and fuel tank problems about 2500 charades 
and 3200 applauses already had been exported to the united states 
and europe daihatsu said

just when you thought we were leaving the 
workaholic 1980s behind comes a chilling sign that rampant 
careerism may be here to stay 
the decade in which power breakfasts nudged aside threemartini 
lunches may have left an indelible mark on our culture come 
january faithful users of the weekataglance appointment 
calendars will find that daily starting times in one of the most 
popular versions have been changed from 8 am to 7 am the end of 
the day is an hour earlier at 730 pm 
were not a 9 to 5 society anymore said mike kinnick 
marketing director for keith clark the sidney nybased company 
that makes the calendars 
customers complained their day started before the 8 am time 
listed in the planner he said 
we heard from customers and we decided to make the change i 
think as our society gets more intense people are just starting to 
work more and go to work earlier kinnick said 
but at least one customer was dismayed 
barbra zuck locker 37 who has used the weekataglance for 
years was so disturbed when she noticed the shift in times in the 
1990 calendars that she wrote a letter to the new york times that 
appeared this week 
alas 1989 days began at 8 now my bookcalendar informs 
me i can go home at 845 thats ok but do i really want to begin 
my mornings in the 1990s at 7 am she said 
locker fits the stereotype of the 80s woman she is a 
psychologist in private practice in manhattan as well as a 
corporate psychological consultant and director of employee 
assistance programs at citicorp 
but rather than welcome the change in her weekly planner locker 
is upset about what she sees as an inability among americans to 
relax 
we seem to be afraid of leisure time maybe it makes us 
anxious locker said from new york weve created a culture 
that we thought was going to a be a leisure culture in the 1920s 
we thought wed evolve to this future with all these laborsaving 
devices and wed have all this free time but weve done a 
360degree turn people are working so hard and have less leisure 
time 
in addition to changing the daily starting time the 1990 
weekataglance almost does away with sunday 
in a portion of the letter that didnt appear in the times 
locker wrote 
sunday the blank space of the week a lefthand corner 
mercifully bereft of 15minute time slots beautifully empty 
12lined sunday suddenly compressed to eight lines so that saturday 
can start at 7 am is this the message for the 90s 
not necessarily according to filofax inc a subsidiary of a 
british company whose thick planners came to symbolize 
selfimportant fatuous yuppies who used them to schedule their 
every waking moment 
filofaxs most popular planner a sixring organizer has blank 
blocks so customers can fill in their own times if they buy one of 
10 inserts that fit the planner two of them come with scheduled 
times the good news at least for locker is that filofax still 
believes the day begins at 8 am 
the trend is to keep things very flexible martin hackel 
president of filofax said from stamford conn

their first day and are given a sandwich and 10 papers which sell 
for 75 cents each 
of that 50 cents goes into the salesmans pocket and a nickel 
goes into a bank account in his or her name money from the account 
can only be withdrawn as a cashiers check made out to a landlord 
for an apartment 
if you can shake a cup you can sell this newspaper says 
persons a 33yearold rock musician who has been active in 
philanthropic efforts were trying to offer an alternative to 
panhandling

there were stories about the art of train conversation and 
tourist in tiananmen 
the second issue featured stories by joe simmons of the rap 
group rundmc and actress mariette hartley but the emphasis was 
on articles by and about the homeless themselves including a 
feature about one of the newspapers top salesmen who also wrote a 
story about loneliness 
in the premiere issue persons wrote that he was inspired to 
create the newspaper when he saw homeless people in grand central 
terminal 
i thought what an untapped work force all these people just 
lying around here but what can they do this thought plagued me 
off and on day and night for about a week until suddenly it hit 
me they could sell newspapers persons wrote 
for money and help he turned to connections he had made as a 
musician and in his work on live aid and as head of street aid a

better giving them money its not like youre giving them a free 
meal

be down in the subways somewhere who knows where ill sleep he 
said 
the newspaper promotes opportunities in its classified ads one 
tells where to redeem bottles and cans another job requires 
residence or referral letter from shelter or regularly attended

perhaps the ugliest expression 
of the distrust or outright hatred of foreigners here is a leaflet 
dropped on the capital recently by air force planes 
it is directed to the salvadoran patriot and reads you 
have the full and legitimate right to defend your life and 
property if in order to do that you must kill fmln terrorists as 
well as their internationalist allies do it 
fmln stands for the farabundo marti national liberation front 
the guerrilla army waging a 10yearold war for power against a 
succession of usbacked governments 
internationalists are americans canadians europeans and 
nonsalvadoran latin americans who work with the poor either 
through churchaffiliated groups or humanitarian organizations 
several hundred reside in el salvador rightist considers them 
subversives 
the politics of most are quite to the left of center but the 
overwhelming majority work entirely above ground for respected 
organizations such as the lutheran church or the jesuit refugee 
service 
lets destroy them lets finish them off says the flier 
which is signed air force of el salvador below the legend 
with god reason and might we shall conquer 
the air force is the most vehemently rightist of the three 
military branches 
consulted about the incendiary leaflet col rene emilio ponce 
chief of the joint chiefs of staff acknowledged the air force 
wrote it 
he said he interpreted it to refer only to foreigners who are 
active combatants in the insurgent army 
there is no campaign of persecution of foreigners he said 
however more than two dozen internationalists including 10 
americans have been detained during raids on their organizations 
or homes since a rebel offensive began nov 11 
the great majority have been expelled under a state of siege 
imposed in response to the rebel push one american 28yearold 
jennifer casolo of thomaston conn was charged with terrorism 
after police discovered ammunition and explosives buried in her 
back yard 
she denies complicity with the rebels saying the munitions may 
have been buried during one of her frequent trips outside the 
capital 
five spanishborn roman catholic priests were among eight people 
massacred nov 16 rightists had long denounced the five who were 
naturalized salvadorans and their salvadoranborn jesuit 
colleagues as revolutionary ideologues 
the government radio station in the days before the slaying 
broadcast telephone calls from listeners denouncing the priests as 
foreigners and mercenaries of international marxism 
la prensa el salvadors most widely circulated daily newspaper 
dedicated virtually all its editorial page wednesday to two 
articles one titled undesirable foreigners and the other 
headlined stricter controls on entrance 
the long salvadoran conflict has been a stage for the direct 
interference of foreigners who in the most diverse guises from 
simple adventurers to religious missionaries have come to our 
small and convulsed country to experience the drama of the third 
world one editorial said

paul mccartney is singing a slightly different 
tune now about a possible beatles reunion 
when he suggested last month that he george harrison and ringo 
starr may come together for a reunion harrison responded there 
wouldnt be one as long as john lennon remains dead 
mccartney said thursday he understood but he still held out 
hope for a reunion 
there cant be a beatles reunion because john died 
mccartney told a news conference before his concert at the skydome 
and i dont think any of us would be interested in 
substituting someone for john even his son julian which has 
been suggested but there is a film we might get around to in a 
couple of years that weve been meaning to do and there might 
possibly be some involvement there where we play together 
he said the group wouldnt call it a beatles reunion but the 
media probably would

entertainer wayne newtons lawyer says if 
his clients 53 million damage award in a suit against nbc news 
is overturned it would have dire consequences to the public 
newton sued the network in 1981 claiming that a series of 
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him the broadcasts linked newton to 
alleged crime figures and centered on his purchase of the aladdin 
hotel here 
lawyer morton galane said in a brief filed with a federal 
appeals court in san francisco last month that if the verdict is 
overturned victims of malicious defamation by the mass media 
will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred 
from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods 
the cost of litigating against a media giant like nbc will 
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to 
receive 
if upheld newtons award would be the largest on record arising 
from a news report 
a jury awarded newton 192 million in damages in 1986 the 
following year us district judge myron crocker cut the award to 
53 million but upheld the jurys libel findings nbc appealed

the soviet union is packing up mig23 fighter 
jets based at vietnams cam ranh bay the usbuilt port the 
soviets turned into their largest naval facility outside their 
borders administration sources say 
there have been a series of reports that they have been 
disassembling and packing up their mig23s for shipment said one 
source who spoke on condition he not be identified by name 
the reports have triggered speculation the soviets might be 
scaling down or could be preparing a pullout from cam ranh bay 
the changes indicate it could be a complete pullout or it 
could lead to a significant reduction in soviet military 
involvement at the base the source said thursday 
there could be several reasons behind such a possible pullback 
the source and other asian specialists said in a series of 
interviews 
the move could be a reflection of the worldwide soviet reduction 
in naval activities that has occurred over the past months which 
some us analysts have speculated may be due to economic pressures 
the cam ranh changes also could foreshadow a possible unilateral 
soviet initiative designed to oneup the united states as it 
prepares to enter into negotiations on renewing leases for us 
bases in the philippines the administration source said 
it could be a setup to embarrass us the source said 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev proposed several years ago to 
withdraw from the base his most strategic foreign site in asia 
if the united states would pull out of the six bases it has leased 
in the philippines 
us officials rejected the proposal 
the leases on the us bases expire in 1991 and the renewal has 
become a hotly debated topic particularly in light of the recent 
us intervention against the rebel forces attempting to overthrow 
president corazon aquino 
one defense analyst who declined to comment specifically on the 
mig23 move said the idea of a unilateral soviet drawdown to point 
up the us problems with the philippines wouldnt be out of line 
with pentagon assumptions 
theyd like to complicate our lives the analyst said of the 
soviets weve been predicting some deemphasis there 
jonathan pollack the head of the rand corporations political 
science department and a specialist on the role of the soviet union 
in indochina said the soviets have tended to keep about 20 vessels 
and 40 aircraft at the cam ranh base 
pollack in a telephone interview said he would not be 
surprised by a soviet cutback 
if there are changes in the more distant deployments it could 
be explained by a mix of factors not only economic but also a 
reconsideration of what is crucial to soviet security concerns 
he said 
the analyst said that lots of gorbachevs proposals are for a 
pr public relations effect but he wouldnt be surprised if a 
reduction at cam ranh bay was made without any publicity 
in the context of what clearly is a major change in the 
ussoviet relationship the value of distant soviet bases is 
reduced he said 
cam ranh bay located several hundred miles from ho chi minh 
city formerly saigon on vietnams eastern coast offers one of 
the finest harbors in indochina and provides a safe anchorage to 
all types of vessels year round 
the japanese made use of the harbor in world war ii but it was 
transformed into a modern military facility by the united states 
during the vietnam conflict when warehouses airstrips and other 
naval support facilities were built 
according to the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies the soviet union has regularly deployed at the 
base an average of one or two submarines and a range of surface 
combat ships as well as patrol mine warfare amphibious and 
support vessels 
the air units have included six tu95 bear longrange 
bombers 16 tu16 badger fighter aircraft and a squadron of the 
mig23 flogger fighter jets the institute reported in its 
the military balance 19891990 publication

the bounce isnt there anymore mikhail 
gorbachev doesnt light up a room simply by entering it often 
unpredictable in the past the soviet leader did not challenge 
president bush at the malta summit with dazzling new proposals 
the closest he came was proposing that nucleararmed warships be 
included in arms control negotiations but gorbachev had 
telegraphed the initiative through the media before he sat down 
with bush and the administration had decided to resist even 
tinkering with the us navy before the president left washington 
gorbachev also showed bush a map illustrating how the soviet 
union was ringed by american military might the soviets had used 
the tactic of negotiating with pictures before and the gambit did 
not produce us concessions 
gorbachev pulled no rabbits out of a hat offered no massive 
withdrawal of soviet forces extended no invitation to banish 
nuclear weapons 
as a result the president was not placed in the position of 
having to cope with an ingenious and inventive adversary by meeting 
him halfway 
the relief on the american side was as obvious as the choppy 
weather bush had all the time he needed to lay out a dozen mild 
suggestions to improve us relations with moscow he was not 
forced to come up with a quick reply to dramatic and unexpected 
propositions from the soviet side 
still it wasnt all sweetness and light as bush remarked at the 
end 
the hundreds of reporters who dutifully filed from malta the 
gushing accounts of an improved superpower relationship provided to 
them by anonymous us sources are balancing the record now 
that they are back home with the negative side of bushs first 
rendezvous with gorbachev 
it turns out for instance that the soviet leader has no 
intention of complying with a us demand that he force the ouster 
of president najibullah in afghanistan 
bush told gorbachev the moslem rebels who are trying to take 
power in kabul with us support are unwilling to reach a 
settlement with najibullah to end an 11yearold civil war that has 
taken an estimated 1 million casualties 
but gorbachev dismissed the demand saying najibullah whose 
forces are armed by moscow is a national figure who is growing 
more popular all the time 
it also turned out that the soviets have not shelved their 
opposition to the us strategic defense initiative the dispute 
over star wars is still an obstacle to concluding a treaty to 
trim bombers missiles and submarines in time for the 
bushgorbachev summit meeting in washington next june 
the soviets offered in september to separate negotiations over 
spacebased defenses from the talks on reducing strategic weapons 
arsenals 30 percent to 50 percent but it turned out at the summit 
that gorbachev still is determined to establish clear rules on what 
the two sides can do with weapons in space 
two other problems surfaced even before the summit adjourned 
gorbachev told bush he did not know how soviet arms are getting 
to leftist rebels in el salvador and he is determined to have 
negotiators cap submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
thats a double problem the missiles are hard to keep track of 
and the united states is reluctant to curb one of its trump cards 
in the nuclear weapons competition 
gorbachev has been in power nearly five years now 
american participants in the malta summit found him confident as 
ever 
he also seems graver which is understandable considering the 
uphill task he has undertaken to reconstruct the soviet economy and 
to maneuver around the dazzling changes that are sweeping eastern 
europe 
he gave me the impression of a man sure of himself in 
control not ebullient nor the quiet of worry said a senior 
us official who was at the table with bush aboard the maxim gorky 
he spoke in a very forthright manner about the economic 
problems he was up against his thoughts for tackling them his 
basic theme was ive got problems and im working on them the 
official recalled 
but when you look at the soviet problems the official said 
they are very deep and very broad

the conviction of a former boeing co 
marketing executive sends a clear signal that the government wont 
tolerate illegal trafficking of classified pentagon documents 
within the defense industry says the us attorney whose office 
tried the case 
a us district court jury deliberated only two hours thursday 
before convicting richard lee fowler on 39 counts arising from his 
possession of secret defense department and national security 
council budget documents 
fowler a 64yearold former air force officer who had worked in 
the pentagon could be sentenced to 310 years in prison and fined 
225000 sentencing was set for jan 12 
fowlers lawyers said they would appeal 
the charges against fowler included conspiracy mail fraud 
illegal conveyance of classified documents and conversion of the 
papers for his own use 
the documents known as planning programming and budget 
system documents generally dealt with pentagon procurement 
plans sometimes for five years 
employees for several defense contractors testified that they 
were part of a ninecompany network whose washington 
representatives swapped the classified documents in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s 
the nine companies were identified in testimony as boeing 
honeywell bendix ibm rca since merged into general electric 
co grumman raytheon rockwell and martin marietta 
this case in my view puts everyone in the defense 
contracting industry on notice that theft conversion and 
conveyance of classified documents will not be tolerated said 
henry hudson us attorney for the eastern district of virginia 
it sends a clear message it wont be tolerated 
hudson said investigations continue into the use by defense 
contractors of classified pentagon documents but he refused to 
discuss specifics 
fowler seemed stunned as he faced the jury while the court clerk 
read the verdict on each of the 39 counts at times he closed his 
eyes and other times stood stoically while members of his family 
cried 
one of the jurors wiped away tears and others fought back tears 
fowler worked for boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986 
after an investigation began 
boeing pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents from 
fowler and has agreed to pay fines of 52 million 
fowler had little to say after the verdict but when asked 
whether he had been made a scapegoat he said i would rather not 
comment on that i mean you can draw your own conclusions 
during closing arguments assistant us attorney randy bellows 
described fowler as the linchpin of the documentswapping 
network 
mr fowler was the common thread running through every witness 
who was trafficking in this secret material bellow said mr 
fowler played a unique role in the conspiracy he was the 
supplier 
defense lawyer john bray said the only reason fowler was 
prosecuted was because he refused to divulge his sources 
dick fowler has made a very unfortunate enemy by what he has 
done the pentagon bray said

nine monkeys that have been made immune to the 
simian aids virus may hold in their blood cells and tissues the 
critical clues needed by scientists to develop an aids vaccine for 
humans 
these are now very valuable animals said michael 
murpheycorb head of a team of scientists at the delta regional 
primate research center in covington la theres a lot we can 
learn from them 
in a study published today in the journal science murpheycorb 
and her tulane university colleagues announced they have developed 
a vaccine that protects rhesus monkeys from simian immunodeficiency 
virus siv which causes aids in monkeys 
other aids researchers praised the work one calling it a 
giant leap in the race to find a human aids vaccine 
nine animals inoculated with the vaccine are healthy despite 
being injected with powerful doses of the killer virus siv is a 
close genetic relative of human immunodeficiency virus hiv 
which causes aids in humans 
we can look at these animals immune system and learn what 
exactly these monkeys immune systems did to cause them to be 
protected murpheycorb said in an interview 
we now have a foundation so that we can progress in a 
straightforward fashion toward development of a human hiv vaccine 
dr robert gallo director of aids vaccine research at the 
national cancer institute and codiscoverer of the aids virus 
called the tulane research very important and highly 
significant 
although siv is not the same as hiv and a rhesus monkey is not 
the same as a human siv is the closest virus that we have to 
hiv he said it has quite a bit of similarities and it 
produces a similar disease 
dr wayne koff chief of aids vaccine research at the national 
institutes of health said the work by murpheycorb and her 
colleagues has dispelled any doubts about our ever being able to 
create a vaccine against hiv 
he called the monkey study results the most significant 
advance in the vaccine field since we started the aids vaccine 
program it is a giant leap 
its terrific said dr allan goldstein a george washington 
university school of medicine researcher who in may started testing 
a type of human aids vaccine 
its an important step in understanding the mechanism for 
protection against a retrovirus that is related to human disease 
goldstein said 
this is another piece of the puzzle that is going to hopefully 
allow us to understand the face and nature of the enemy and how to 
develop the protection that is needed 
koff said the tulane study proves that the primate immune system 
can be primed to protect itself against a retrovirus both siv and 
hiv are retroviruses that kill by destroying the immune system of 
the host 
gallo said researchers will be able to examine the monkeys 
immune systems and determine how the extremely complex network of 
cells proteins and organs interact to produce an immunity to aids 
from these clues he said scientists may be able to determine 
which combination of hiv viral proteins will produce such an 
immunity in humans 
what we will likely get is what immune response correlates 
best with protection and then you will go try to reproduce that in 
man with proteins from the virus he said 
murpheycorb said her team developed the monkey vaccine by 
purifying samples of siv then killing the virus with a chemical 
called formalin that left the virus inactivated but with all its 
proteins intact 
gallo koff and others said the technique used for developing 
the monkey vaccine could not be applied safely to humans because it 
is difficult in using a whole virus to be absolutely certain that 
every viral particle is killed when the vaccine is prepared 
murpheycorb acknowledged the problem 
there is a conceptual chance that one virus particle would 
remain alive after treatment so that when you immunize an 
individual you might actually infect them she said 
it would be not that safe for humans but the experimental 
approach is there what works for one should very likely work with 
the other 
a number of candidate vaccines for the human aids virus are 
being tested but they are based on specific proteins from hiv 
rather than the whole virus some use synthetic compounds that 
match specific viral proteins 
in the louisiana study injections using the inactivated simian 
virus were given to nine rhesus monkeys that had not previously 
been exposed to siv thirteen months later the test monkeys and 
five control monkeys received injections of live virus 10 times 
the amount that earlier studies had shown was enough to produce 
simian aids 
of the control animals all five became infected and three of 
them died within seven months murpheycorb said in the nine 
vaccinated animals eight are not infected and nine of nine are 
clinically well 
murpheycorb said a single inoculated monkey showed some 
laboratory signs of viral infection but it has no clinical 
symptoms of aids 
she said the experiment proved that the monkeys reacted to the 
killed whole virus by developing immunity against the live virus 
the same system used to develop some polio vaccines 
though siv and hiv are distinctly different viruses almost 50 
percent of their genetic pattern is the same 
what works for one should very likely work with the other 
said murpheycorb she emphasized however that the monkey vaccine 
cannot be used in humans against hiv 
as of sept 30 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 109167 
americans of whom more than half 64849 have died since june 1 
1981 according to the centers for disease control no one is known 
to have recovered fully from aids

super mario must face firebreathing dragons 
deathdealing birds and a gauntlet of other fantasy threats to 
rescue a kidnapped princess but can nintendos videogame star 
handle a federal investigation 
the chairman of a house panel demanded one thursday as he 
suggested the maker of the immensely popular electronic games is 
using unfair and abusive sales practices to monopolize the market 
and keep prices high 
super mario as just about any schoolage child knows is one of 
a legion of characters in the games sold by nintendo he has leaped 
from the video screen to tshirts lunch pails and cereal boxes 
with mario bouncing across a screen next to him rep dennis 
eckart dohio said at a news conference that he has asked the 
justice departments antitrust division to investigate nintendo of 
america inc for possible violations of antitrust laws 
he turned over what he called strong evidence found by his 
subcommittee 
the question is has nintendo grown so big an 800pound 
gorilla that the rest of the world is incapable of getting around 
it eckart asked 
nintendo officials angrily charged theyd been ambushed by 
eckart and denied a chance to present their side to congress 
this guy is just grandstanding said howard c lincoln 
senior vice president of nintendo in redmond wash 
eckart chairman of the house small business subcommittee on 
antitrust accused nintendo of intimidating retailers to keep 
competitors games off toy store shelves 
he said nintendo has used exclusive software arrangements and 
physical computerchip barriers to control the market and that 
nintendo had created artificial shortages of some games 
the result of nintendos marketing practices he said is that 
only games licensed or sold by nintendo can be played on the 
nintendo players thus blocking independent software publishers 
and inflating the costs of games to consumers by 20 percent to 30 
percent 
nintendo right now is saying you can buy our machines but you 
can play only our games eckart said 
nintendo is the us subsidiary of a japanese manufacturer that 
revived the domestic electronic game industry and now controls 80 
percent of the 34 billion market 
eckart raised the issue less than three weeks before christmas 
as parents of children all over the country are buying or looking 
for popular nintendo games some of the most popular such as 
super mario brothers simons quest and double dragon 
were in short supply last christmas and shortages of other games 
loom this year 
the basic game unit costs 80 to 150 depending on accessories 
and game cartridges range in price from 40 to 60 each 
by nintendos own estimate it will have its electronic 
gameplaying units in 20 percent of all us households by the end 
of 1989 some 20 million units the percentage for households with 
children aged 7 and up to midteens the prime gameplaying market 
is far higher 
they have done a brilliant job in marketing their product but 
the simple fact remains that our subcommittee investigation has 
revealed there is no competition among competitors eckart said 
he wrote to james f rill assistant attorney general and head 
of the antitrust division of the justice department asking for the 
probe 
he released his letter and described the investigation at a news 
conference where he told reporters his staff had two interviews 
with nintendo representatives 
but in a telephone interview lincoln heatedly disputed that 
claim and accused eckart of an outright lie he said nintendo 
only learned of the investigation on a rumor and that eckart 
canceled a hearing where nintendo was to speak 
in presenting his case against nintendo eckart credited the 
company with reviving a moribund video game market with its product 
but he compared nintendo to atampt before the breakup of its 
nationwide telephone monopoly and to the producers of phonographs 
50 years ago when equipment was designed so that only a companys 
own records had the uniquely shaped hole that would fit their 
players 
eckart said nintendo installs a lockout chip or patented 
computer chip in each cartridge so that only licensed game 
cartridges including that chip can be used on nintendo players no 
such chip is used by nintendo in japan and competing game 
companies do not use such a chip he said 
lincoln said the chip was a security device blocking 
counterfeit pirated and poorquality games 
he charged that eckarts probe was triggered by a complaint by a 
rival company atari games corp and its tengen inc subsidiary 
nintendo has a federal suit pending in san francisco against 
ataritengen alleging copyright theft and patent infringement

the gunman who roamed through the university of 
montreals engineering school and killed 14 women carried a suicide 
letter vowing to seek revenge on women for ruining his life police 
said thursday 
the killer identified by police thursday night as marc lepine 
25 of montreal also wounded nine women and four men before 
killing himself wednesday in the worst mass murder in canadian 
history 
police identified lepine as a warmovie fanatic who was always 
frustrated by women said police spokesman andre tessier 
lepine had trouble developing relationships with women and broke 
off all communication at the first sign of rejection said police 
spokesman andre tessier lepine had taken courses with the aim of 
entering the engineering school tessier said 
as he roamed through the modern sixstory engineering building 
firing a rifle lepine ranted i want the women and youre 
all a bunch of feminists i hate feminists witnesses told police 
one of the wounded remained in critical but stable condition 
thursday the rest were out of danger 
a montreal gun shop salesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said lepine bought the hunting rifle used in the 
slayings on nov 21 for 510 the provincial gun permit was in the 
name of marc lepine 
earlier a broadcast report gave the name as marc lapin 
the employee said lepine bought a handgun there about two years 
ago 
he didnt appear to be any crazier than anyone else 
actually he was a bit of a joker he said 
police said lepine who was single and unemployed was born in 
montreal to a quebec mother and an algerian father and was known as 
gamil gharbi until age seven his parents separated and he took his 
mothers last name lepine and the first name marc 
senior police investigator jacques duchesneau told a news 
conference lepine had certain problems in relationships with 
women he was known to be always very gentle and courteous with 
women until the relationship didnt go his way 
he seemed to be very intelligent 
duchesneau said lepine was obsessed with war films and 
electronics he seemed to have no problems with alcohol or drugs 
in his letter lepine said he was committing a political act 
in killing the women because feminists had always ruined my 
life police reported 
duchesneau said lepine used a 223caliber sturm ruger 
semiautomatic rifle 
he also carried a hunting knife and sheath two boxes of bullets 
and a 30bullet clip 
he was described as about 5foot9 inches weighing 160 pounds 
with brown hair and blue eyes 
the gun shop employee said the firearm bought by lepine was a 
big seller with hundreds sold in his store every year 
canadas gun control laws are generally stricter than those in 
the united states 
duchesneau said it was quite clear that a threepage 
handwritten letter signed marc and found on lepines body was a 
suicide note he said it specified dec 6 as the date for lepines 
death 
he said it contained the names of 15 women that were believed 
taken from a newspaper but declined to elaborate except to say not 
all were public figures 
duchesneau told reporters the letter said lepine was seeking 
revenge on women 
he mentioned in the letter that he did that because of 
political reasons he said feminists kind of spoiled his life and 
he hasnt been happy in life for the last seven years the 
officer said 
i think he blamed women in general saying that if his life 
was ruined it was mainly because of women 
the letter also mentioned former army cpl denis lortie jailed

colombia leads a list of countries in which 
human rights activists were killed this year and us and 
colombian human rights leaders say the troubled countrys 
government shares the blame with its drug dealers 
all the problems of human rights in colombia are not due to 
the drugs gustavo gallon director of the colombian section of 
the andean commission of jurists told reporters thursday 
aryeh neier executive director of human rights watch said many 
of the killings reflect alliances between drug dealers and 
middle level military and police officials in parts of the 
country 
gallon and neier spoke at a news conference at which the human 
rights monitoring organization released a report showing 68 
killings in 1989 of people who monitor human rights abuses in their 
countries 
colombia topped the list with 24 followed by brazil with 14 
killings many of which the report said reflect the intense 
struggle over land distribution in rural areas 
gallon speaking in spanish with an interpreter said the 
situation of human rights was already bad in colombia long before 
the drug problem existed what has happened is that it has gotten 
worse since 
neier said a large number of the killings do involve drug 
dealers but we also believe there have been alliances between drug 
dealers and middlelevel military and police officials in parts of 
the country and that a lot of theses killings reflect those 
alliances 
the human rights official said he believed the government of 
president virgilio barco is genuinely concerned about human 
rights and is not itself at least at the level of the president 
and those associated with him engaged in these kinds of killings 
in any way 
but we want the colombian government to act more firmly 
against those within the armed forces and police forces in colombia 
who do have the alliances with the drug dealers he said 
the 345page report discussed 1200 cases of persecution of 
human rights monitors in 72 countries including arrest 
imprisonment and torture killings and 10 unexplained 
disappearances 
south africa topped the list in the total number of persecution 
cases taking up 36 pages 
a south african human rights representative dean simon 
farisani said while we appreciate at least the readiness of 
south african president fw de klerk not to throw police and 
members of the defense force on our marching people he had 
absolutely no choice because those people continue to be involved 
in a defiant campaign defying the laws that have been imposed on 
them 
czechoslovakia gripped by turmoil over reforms being sought by 
a prodemocracy movement was second in the number of cases of 
persecution taking up 23 pages 
a substantial number of cases involve people who were released 
from prison just a couple of weeks prior to publication of this 
report neier said 
the changes that have been taking place in central and eastern 
europe have had a significant effect he said however he added 
not all of the persons we are concerned about in czechoslovakia 
have been released so there is a way to go 
the report said all but five of the human rights killings 
occurred in countries generally classified as democracies 
dictatorships the report said often dont have to engage in 
killing because they very often suppress all activity of this sort 
so firmly that no one has the opportunity to engage in human rights 
monitoring neier said it is when things open up some but 
dont open up all the way that the greatest climate of danger 
seems to prevail 
the new yorkbased human rights watch is made up of five 
regional committees africa watch americas watch asia watch 
helsinki watch and middle east

the writer covered events in czechoslovakia in 
1968 before the warsaw pact invasion that ended the prague 
spring reforms 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the peaceful revolution sweeping czechoslovakia 
brings many reminders of the euphoric prague spring that was 
crushed by soviet tanks 21 years ago 
the excitement the endless discussions the hopes and the sweet 
taste of freedom to challenge decadesold dogmas are there but the 
similarities are few and the differences are profound 
the prague spring was born within the ruling communist party 
after years of fermentation the change in 1989 came from an 
opposition group that mushroomed into a popular movement in a 
matter of days 
in 1968 no one called for deleting the constitutional guarantee 
of the communist partys power monopoly now that guarantee is 
gone after just 10 days of huge demonstrations against oneparty 
rule 
there were no slogans in 1968 urging free elections now that 
call is on signs and posters throughout the nation 
the illfated 1968 predecessor of mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika had lofty aims to overcome what was then conceded to be 
a deep crisis of society 
a 24000word party program included a long list of goals 
ranging from civil rights guarantees in a state of law to a 
marketoriented economy it was a vision of broadest democracy 
criticism spread in a way that was then without precedent in any 
communist country generals criticized their chiefs of staff 
editors their publishers government officials their ministers and 
ministers the head of state 
it became known as socialism with a human face and it was 
the last real chance for communism to survive in a country where 
the party won a 1947 election 
but even the most outspoken critics of the party the signers of 
the famous 2000 words in june 1968 stressed that the 
communists had a vital function in the work for the common cause 
that has the title socialism 
the leading role of the party was never in doubt then says 
cestmir cisar a central committee secretary in 1968 and a chief 
target of moscows criticism at the time people trusted the 
party 
but now cisar said 20 years of pseudosocialism that have 
since passed have made people lose their confidence 
the young people totally reject the word socialism they do 
not want to hear it and that is understandable because they have 
never known any other form of socialism 
in 1968 the society was ready to accept our kind of 
socialism he added this time the communist party has 
completely lost its leading position 
like cisar libuse silhanova was expelled from the communist 
party in a largescale 1970 purge she lost her teaching job and 
barely managed by knitting for a cooperative 
a founding member of the charter 77 civil rights group she says 
that 1989 cannot be compared with 1968 
except for the spontaneity and the euphoria among the people 
in the street there are no similarities she said and the 
euphoria is greater now 
but so is the concern that the reforms may still fail again she 
made plain in 1968 there was virtually no fear in 
czechoslovakia of interference from abroad she said people 
were shocked when the russians arrived 
now she says there is continued fear that the prodemocracy 
movement will be suppressed by hardliners still firmly entrenched 
in the party hierarchy 
a relapse is still possible she cautioned we know the 
secret police and the state security they are wicked and tricky

new irs rules will free employees from having 
to deal with expense accounts on their tax returns 
if the rules are followed to the letter employers will not have 
to withhold taxes from their workers expense allowances 
the new regulations announced thursday by the internal revenue 
service are designed to avoid harsh results for employers who 
have reasonable substantiation methods said mary oppenhiemer 
the agencys deputy assistant chief counsel 
starting in 1990 an employer must require that employees 
substantiate expenses and turn back any portion of an advance that 
is not substantiated if those two conditions are met the employer 
need not list any part of the expense reimbursement as income on 
the workers w2 form and the worker will not have to claim a 
deduction for the allowance 
in that case ms oppenhiemer said the only amounts that will 
ever show up on the employees form w2 are amounts the employee 
does not substantiate or does not return to the employer 
if the worker does not substantiate expenses or does not return 
any overage that excess would be listed as income on the w2 an 
employee then might be able to take an itemized deduction for part 
of the allowance 
the regulations permit employers to rely on a goodfaith 
interpretation of the law in accounting for 1989 expenses 
ms oppenhiemer told reporters the new regulations are in line 
with the agencys moves toward simplification 
we believe that the regulations will not impose any 
significant new administrative burden on most employers she 
said in fact she said the changes will actually reduce 
compliance burdens for many taxpayers 
the regulations also require that taxes be withheld from expense 
allowances unless the substantiation and returnofexcess 
procedures are followed current rules say withholding is not 
required if the employer reasonably believes the allowances will be 
used for business expenses 
the tougher withholding rule will take effect july 1 
the irs also announced that the standard mileage rate for 
business use of an automobile in 1990 will be 26 cents a mile up 
from 25 cents this year 
this marks the first time the irs has disclosed this annual 
adjustment in advance the rate for a year is usually announced 
about two months before the end of that year 
for 1990 and later years the business mileage rate will be 26 
cents across the board present rules permit the full rate only for 
the first 15000 miles and 11 cents for each additional mile 
the irs said employers will be deemed to have met substantiation 
requirements if they use the 26cent rate in reimbursing employees 
for business use of their cars 
the standard mileage rate for use of a personal car for 
charitable activities will continue at 12 cents a mile next year 
the rate for purposes of calculating medical and moving expenses 
will remain at 9 cents a mile 
another new procedure announced thursday provides a simplified 
safe harbor option for employer reimbursements for employee 
travel expenses 
this will allow employers to use a rate of 122 per day for 28 
highcost areas and 85 per day for all other parts of the united 
states

government scientists say there is no quick 
solution to the problem of brucellosis spreading from wild bison 
and elk into cattle herds bordering yellowstone national park 
a twoday meeting of scientists and others from the departments 
of agriculture and interior was held here this week but two senior 
officials said in a joint interview thursday that no one is close 
to a decision on how to deal with the problem 
brucellosis of cattle has also been called bangs disease and 
infectious abortion it can cause undulant fever in humans usually 
through unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals 
the agriculture department in cooperation with state and local 
governments livestock associations and animal health groups has 
been striving for decades to eliminate the disease from commercial 
herds 
so far according to usda officials 27 states are free of 
brucellosis most of the remainder are in the south 
the problem with bison or american buffalo and elk in the huge 
yellowstone national park is that infected animals can roam onto 
cattle rangelands mingle with herds and thus spread the disease 
while were talking about a very small number of cattle and 
bison and elk in the yellowstone area the potential threat can 
extend over a much wider area said john dennis of the national 
park service 
cattle of course greatly outnumber bison in the united states 
there are nearly 100 million head of cattle compared with an 
estimated 500000 bison including public and private herds 
yellowstone has around 2000 head 
but prospective buyers and shippers of breeding cattle can be 
highly wary of animals from known areas of brucellosis infection 
that is true on the growing international market for livestock as 
well as domestically dennis said 
its a lot easier to do that interchange if everybody is in 
the same status on brucellosis he said some countries may not 
even accept cattle from the united states if we have pockets of 
brucellosis 
john kopec of usdas animal and plant health inspection service 
said that there is much to learn about brucellosis in yellowstone 
we dont know absolutely that this disease may have come from 
infected elk and in one case maybe some bison running around 
he said we dont know this unequivocally but we have more or 
less ruled out all the other sources 
kopec said that since the early 1960s there have six outbreaks 
of brucellosis among cattle in the yellowstone area in which 
infection from other cattle has been ruled out the most recent was 
in february after the disease was detected in an idaho packing 
plant and the slaughtered animal traced to wyoming 
the owner of the exposed cattle decided to liquidate the herd 
sending older cattle to slaughter and younger animals to a 
quarantined feedlot and subsequently to slaughter 
kopec said that one of the problems in the yellowstone area is 
that we havent unequivocally answered the question whether 
bison and elk in the park have carried the disease over many 
centuries or whether it is more recent 
meanwhile he said the cattle industry is putting pressure on 
federal and state authorities to help safeguard commercial herds 
against the potential threat of brucellosis from wild creatures 
kopec and dennis said more experiments and study are needed the 
answers will come slowly 
we may be talking years kopec said its not something 
that will be done overnight

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought 410000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices for delivery in 198990 the seventh year of a longterm 
grain supply agreement 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said thursday that shipments are 
scheduled in january and february 
the wheat was sold under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep which provides subsidies to exporters selling us 
commodities to designated foreign markets 
dickerson said only 14200 tons of wheat remain in the soviet 
unions current eep allocation of 15 million tons announced may 2 
it was the second us wheat sale since the seventh year of the 
longterm grain agreement began oct 1 although more than 103 
million tons of corn have been sold for 198990 delivery along 
with soybeans and soybean meal a sale of 215000 tons was reported 
monday 
the pact runs through dec 31 1990 and a new agreement is 
being negotiated 
in 198889 the sixth year of the current agreement the soviet 
union bought about 54 million tons of wheat and more than 163 
million tons of corn plus soybeans soybean meal and grain 
sorghums 
a metric ton is 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels of 
wheat the 410000 tons are equal to more than 15 million bushels 
worth about 57 million at recent us farm prices 
dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of 1681 per 
ton or about 46 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
dickerson said the wheat was sold by alfred c toepfer

arkansas gov bill clinton says the nations 
desire to reduce the school dropout rate shows how tough it will be 
to set performance goals for education 
suppose you want the dropout rate to be at 9 percent rather 
than the 25 percent rate it is now clinton said in an interview 
three states already have that theres nothing for them to do if 
thats our goal unless we decide that the states have the 
capacity to go down to six and other states will never get below 20 
percent 
see there are a lot of complicated questions like that that 
have to be answered but first we have to get a national goal and 
then well decide how to meet it thats how we got to the moon 
thats how we won world war ii thats how you do things that are 
big 
clinton and south carolina gov carroll campbell jr headed a 
meeting thursday of the national governors association task force 
on education which is preparing national performance goals for 
education as decided at the education summit called by president 
bush in late september 
the task force plans to recommend goals to the governors at 
their winter meeting in february 1990 once goals are approved the 
governors will focus on developing strategies for reaching the 
targets tackling the rest of the agenda set at the summit 
including greater flexibility and enhanced accountability in the 
use of federal resources 
according to clinton the nations educational system will be 
measured by the goals every year beginning in 1991 for a decade 
to determine if learning improves in america 
task force members joined by administration officials heard a 
variety of suggestions from educators advocacy groups and business 
leaders on what those goals should be 
generally the group agreed the nations education system should 
focus on what children actually know as they complete each level of 
schooling rather than on the courses that are being offered 
another key focus the group said should be on making sure 
youngsters enter school healthy and able to learn 
the goals should focus on the ends rather than the means 
said education secretary lauro cavazos we need a handful of 
goals clearly spelled out goals that can lead us in the direction 
of guaranteeing action measuring that action and at the same time 
guaranteeing accountability 
administration officials bristled at one suggestion that all 
high school seniors should be required to pass leaving exams 
with standards set up by what a task force adviser called a 
quasigovernmental institution 
i have not heard from anyone from the governors from 
administration officials since we gave been discussing this for 
several months now the desire or the interest in nationalizing or 
federalizing our education system said roger porter white house 
domestic policy adviser 
however porter did agree educators must more accurately measure 
what students have learned when they leave school 
chester finn a former education department official now at 
vanderbilt university stressed the national goals focus on only 
three areas getting youngsters ready for school preparing 
adolescents for high school and making sure high school students 
are ready for adulthood 
if we can alter the behavior of tens of millions of people as 
a consequence of having these goals then this might be worth 
doing said finn 
nga president terry branstad governor of iowa agreed the list 
of national goals should be short so every school district and 
school can design their own specialized strategies

the ku klux klans offer to join 
protesters at an abortion clinic saturday has angered the groups 
leader who contends theyre only concerned about white babies 
being killed 
their robes and hoods which represent a long history of hate 
and violence will only draw attention away from the real issue 
said rick horton president of the tarrant county prolife action 
network 
horton rescheduled his groups demonstration to avoid picketing 
alongside the klan drawing the wrath of bill walton grand dragon 
of texas invisible empire knights of the ku klux klan 
its just like them to always run walton said the 
antiabortion movement needs all the help all the bodies it can 
get theyre in no position to pick and choose their fellow 
protesters 
but horton characterized the kkks plan to picket the west side 
clinic in this dallas suburb as probably nothing more than a 
publicity stunt 
horton said he was dumbfounded when walton called to say the kkk 
would join the picket 
the grand dragon told me if there were no white babies being 
aborted we wouldnt be at the clinic horton said the kkk 
arent prolife theyre prolife for the white race theyre only 
concerned about white babies being killed 
walton countered were against abortion of any race period 
it doesnt matter if its black white green yellow whatever 
thats murder and murder doesnt discriminate 
walton said he had hoped to picket alongside hortons group with 
about a dozen other kkk members because they could use the 
attention when the klan comes out the media come with us that 
guy needs numbers 
joan echols spokeswoman for the dallas abortion rights 
education league an umbrella organization for supporters of 
legalized abortion said the antiabortion organization and the 
klan were in cahoots just by scheduling their protests at 
different times 
she charged the groups were all cut from the same cloth 
the prolife action network is scheduled to march for two hours 
starting at 8 am followed by the kkk which will march from 10 
am to noon 
bob salinas acting director of public safety in white 
settlement said patrols would not be increased saturday but 
police would monitor the pickets 
horton also said he believes the kkk chose to picket the west 
side clinic because its employees include a black and a jewish 
doctor both of whom fall onto the klan hate list 
walton said the decision was based simply on finding one that 
was open on saturday 
but walton said the klan may have another problem if 
temperatures drop 
them robes arent made for cold weather he said

skypager is mentioned in a rap music hit 
but the owner of the nationwide paging service believes its 
offbeat publicity 
skypager service owned by mobile telecommunication technologies 
corp of jackson is the theme of a popular rap song by sir 
mixalot a seattle band 
mtel officials have considered suing over the rap hit citing 
possible damage to skypagers marketing efforts aimed at 
professionals 
its a delicate situation we did not authorize anything 
thats on there said james phillips president of skytel corp 
mtels satellite paging subsidiary 
the song beepers is written by band leader anthony ray of 
seattle alias sir mixalot 
ray and another band member use skypager which allows them to 
call a tollfree number to page each other in most us cities the 
service geared to traveling executives uses a satellite signal 
a few lyrics from beepers 
skypager looks like a phaser thats the attire of a 
northwest player how does mixalot communicate with beepers 
baby beepers 
the song gives the services tollfree telephone number and 
repeats a part of the computersynthesized message that callers 
hear when they page skypager clients 
welcome to skypager to use skypager press the pound key 
after each entry please enter the pin number you wish 
skypager skypager skypager skyskyskyskyskypager 
that song certainly doesnt suggest the normal use of our 
product phillips said we dont know if well take any action 
or not were friends of the music industry and we want to stay 
friends 
the jackson company has a number of music industry customers 
including stevie wonder and barbra streisand 
band manager larry serrin of artist management inc said the 
skypager name and voice is readily available to the public 
its pretty much public domain he said if anything else 
its promoting skypagers 
a skypager customer alerted mtel to the song a few weeks ago 
so far phillips hasnt noticed much impact on business from the 
song except for increased calls to skypagers service center 
i cant say much for the lyrics but its a good sound he 
said hopefully people will just listen to the music

the government billed the fight 
between roberto duran and sugar ray leonard as a political battle 
with the united states using it to drum up support for gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
government news media predicted it would be a night to celebrate 
a triumph over imperialism but leonard spoiled the party in las 
vegas thursday night with an easy 12round decision over panamas 
native son 
with this defeat what we have is a night like a tomb said 
one of the few people on the street after the fight 
it is clear as water another fan said he lost sugar ray 
is a better boxer 
the government in a sense was the only winner in panama 
because of us economic sanctions against panama television 
transmission rights were sold only for transmission by a private 
station that serves only panama city and colon 
but just hours before the fight the government ordered 
television stations into a nationwide hookup forcing the private 
station that had the rights to share the signal with the government 
station 
early in the evening people gathered at homes or set up large 
television screens on sidewalks and lined up beer coolers in 
preparation for the fiesta to celebrate a duran victory 
in el chorrillo a slum near the entrance to the panama canal 
where duran was born and ran barefoot as a child hundreds gathered 
to watch the fight on a large television screen perched on a 
flatbed truck 
loud music played for hours before the fight and fans danced in 
the streets 
this is more than just a fight said national assemblyman 
luis esquivel he said the noriegas defense forces which give him 
the clout to control the nation had provided the screen 
we are trying to develop our sense of nationalism he said 
even if duran loses this will be an affirmation of our 
nationality in the face of us aggression 
fans stood and sang the national anthem before the fight and 
then cheered in the first few rounds by the sixth round it was 
clear victory celebrations were off 
he is tied up said a fan of duran who at 38 appeared 
slow in trying to get close to leonard 
as the last round ended a woman picked up her chair and said 
dejectedly well its over 
but life goes on she added turning to a companion after 
all if there wasnt a duran victory to celebrate there was 
something else 
a few minutes later as music started playing again the woman 
was dancing in the street it was just after midnight and panamas 
mothers day had begun

he was harassed reviled and often 
imprisoned for challenging the communist government now dissident 
playwright vaclav havel says he is willing to become president 
havel a banned playwright and leader of the opposition movement 
that has brought the hardline government to its knees has 
repeatedly declined political office 
but when asked again thursday if he would accept the presidency 
if it was offered he said he would 
i have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that 
i have no political ambitions i dont feel myself to be a 
professional politician but have always put the public interest 
ahead of my own he told a crowded news conference in the laterna 
magika theater 
and if god help us the situation should develop in such a 
way that the only service i could render my country would be to do 
this then of course i would do it havel said 
he stressed that nobody is pushing his candidacy and that he 
only would assume the presidency if this was the only way out of 
the standoff between the beleaguered government and the 
increasingly powerful opposition movement 
the more democratic and more normal the condition in our 
country the less my role will be the mustachioed blond 
playwright said 
havel has avoided interviews in the past two hectic weeks that 
have seen his opposition group the civic forum direct a movement 
that has forced the communists to relinquish their 41year monopoly 
on power ousted most hardline leaders and paved the way for a 
coalition government that could restore democracy 
if i continually commented on the revolution i could not have 
participated in it he said 
he characterized events so far as a cultural revolution that 
began as a student protest against police violence on nov 17 and 
mushroomed into a movement that may return czechoslovakia to its 
democratic humanistic traditions 
what is important is what the students began with that is 
the humanitarian dimension resistance to violence the longing for 
truth and moral integrity said havel his current role follows a 
long tradition of czech intellectuals doubling as political leaders 
as a founder member of charter 77 eastern europes oldest human 
rights movement havel has spent most of the last 13 years under 
police surveillance and served 4 years in jail for his activism 
havel said the main aim of civic forum is to see the country 
enjoy free elections soon but he stressed that czechoslovakia 
should not necessarily return to its same prewar system of 
capitalist democracy 
now a modern contemporary government should design a modern 
contemporary system which would return to people their honor and 
freedom havel said 
in this struggle he said naming the right prime minister is 
more important than 10 presidents whose role as head of state is 
largely ceremonial 
havel said he would like to see jan carnogursky a slovak 
dissident who is a lawyer and a respected roman catholic activist 
as premier 
civic forum is pushing carnogursky as a first deputy premier to 
the communist premier named thursday marian calfa another slovak 
by tradition if the premier is slovak czechoslovakias 
president is a czech 
the incumbent president gustav husak is a slovak who is 
regarded as one of the communists most responsible for the 
crackdown on reform after the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the 
prague spring in 1968 
civic forum said thursday it wants as president a czech who is 
not a member of any political party and not connected in any way 
with the current structures of government 
havel the playwrightturnedpolitician was presidentially 
diplomatic 
you dont accept the basic presidential quality of answering 
in a roundabout way he joked i have heard news conferences by 
president bush and ive heard him give evasive answers and say no

the volatile mixture of art and commerce has 
erupted in a multimilliondollar lawsuit filed by a collector 
against a scholar and the venerable metropolitan museum of art in 
new york 
the man in the middle american artist john la farge a muralist 
and stained glass maker who lived from 1835 to 1910 
la farge decorated the palaces of new yorks gilded age and 
public buildings nationwide he invented the opalescent glass 
widely commercialized by tiffany 
his works are selling for up to hundreds of thousands of dollars 
the vagaries of assigning a monetary value to his individual 
creative works are at the center of the lawsuit filed in federal 
court here by sean m mcnally hes a collector and former goldman 
sachs investment banker who devotes his time to studying and 
dealing in la farge works 
mcnally claims hes the victim of professional jealousy while a 
lawyer for la farge scholar james yarnall of washington charges 
that the lawsuit challenges the integrity of art scholarship 
others are concerned the real loser may be la farge 
la farge is too great an artist to be cast around in the 
gutter this way says william vareika a newport ri gallery 
owner 
the lawsuit claims yarnall who is preparing a catalogue of la 
farges works engaged in a campaign to undermine the value of 
mcnallys collection and disparage his expertise on the artist the 
met allegedly stood by yarnall despite knowing he was wrong 
yarnalls lawyer peter r stern called the lawsuit the case of 
an art speculator against an art scholar 
i think that this case represents a serious attack on all art 
scholarship and history said stern 
met spokesman john ross said mcnallys claims are without 
basis he said yarnall was an independent contractor who was 
mistakenly listed in the museums annual report as a staff member 
according to mcnallys court papers the seeds of the dispute 
were sown in february 1988 when mcnally appraised a la farge piece 
called moon window for a private collector at 20000 
yarnall told met benefactor richard m schwartz that moon 
window was worth 200000 the lawsuit said schwartz bought the 
work for 165000 a month later 
in april its companion piece sold at auction for 14200 
that sale showed yarnalls appraisal to be inaccurate and set 
him on his course to denigrate and diminish both mcnallys 
collection and his professional reputation the lawsuit alleged 
people get jealous said mcnallys attorney christopher w 
hyde 
according to the lawsuit an example of this was when yarnall 
later told schwartz in the presence of met officials that a mcnally 
window was unimportant badly restored and not worth the 150000 
schwartz was ready to pay for it that appraisal sank the deal 
then in june yarnall allegedly told vareika who was exhibiting 
mcnallys la farge works that one of mcnallys windows was not 
authentic 
the lawsuit filed nov 28 has slander libel and contract 
interference claims and seeks at least 28 million in punitive and 
other damages 
la farge scholarship is particularly competitive because most of 
the material about him has remained with descendants said henry 
adams a la farge expert and american art curator at the 
nelsonatkins museum in kansas city 
and the la farge market is particularly difficult to evaluate 
because of the broad range of quality and media in his work adams 
said 
museums are put in a difficult position when asked to give 
appraisals said ulysses dietz curator of decorative arts at the 
newark museum 
its a real clash between the function of a museum and the 
function of a marketplace dietz said particularly when donors 
of works are seeking tax deductions for their largesse 
but lawsuits such as the one filed by mcnally could have a 
very chilling effect on a museums desire to help spread 
information he said its what every museum lives in constant 
fear of

on oct 18 1988 more than 30 family members 
or business associates of controversial savings and loan figure 
charles h keating jr contributed 1000 each to thensen chic 
hechts reelection campaign 
the federal election commission which puts strict 
1000perperson limits on contributions to an election campaign 
is investigating whether such multiple contributions were handled 
illegally agency spokesman scott moxley said thursday 
the fec acted at the request of sen john mccain rariz a 
recipient of keatings largess who asked the agency oct 30 whether 
there was potentially illegal action by keatings 
corporations and contributors 
mccains request only referred to the keatingrelated donations 
he received but moxley said the agency can decide to expand the 
probe to contributions to other members of congress he would not 
say whether the fec has done so 
keating and his associates and family members followed the 
pattern of multiple donations during a campaign often on the same 
day with a number of lawmakers as he admittedly sought to 
increase his influence with congress 
spokesmen for keating did not return several telephone calls 
seeking reaction on the fec probe 
among keatings contributions during the 1980s were 13 million 
to the campaigns and causes of five senators mccain and democrats 
alan cranston of california the majority whip banking committee 
chairman donald w riegle jr of michigan governmental affairs 
committee chairman john glenn of ohio and dennis deconcini of 
arizona 
the five intervened on keatings behalf with federal banking 
regulators in april 1987 when his lincoln savings and loan of 
irvine calif was collapsing 
the senate ethics committee is trying to determine whether there 
was a connection between the intervention and the donations 
now taken over by the federal government the expected 2 
billionplus cost of protecting lincolns depositors should make 
this the most expensive thrift failure in the nations history 
federal election law prohibits anyone from making a donation on 
behalf of someone else for instance a corporate chief could not 
have employees give 1000 under their names and reimburse them to 
skirt the donation limit 
moxley said the law is unclear on whether someone could 
orchestrate contributions by employees with no promise of 
reimbursement 
the associated press requested an fec check of campaign 
contributions made on specific days by keating his immediate 
family members and business associates the dates were chosen at 
random 
the agency computer found 
more than 30 separate 1000 donations went from keating 
associates or family members to the general election campaign of 
thensen chic hecht rnev on oct 18 1988 
on april 9 1988 keating and five associates contributed to 
the primary campaign of sen orrin g hatch rutah the same day 
keating his wife and two others gave to hatchs general election 
campaign 
on march 11 1987 there were nearly 20 keatingrelated 
contributions to the primary campaign of riegle and seven to his 
general election campaign and even more multiple donations the 
same day many of the contributions could have been tickets to a 
dinner for riegle on march 23 at a keating property the 
ponchartrain hotel in detroit the 1000 perperson limit applies 
to such events 
sen timothy wirth a member of the senate banking committee 
received four 1000 donations on feb 13 1987 for his general 
election campaign 
deconcini received two donations to his general election 
campaign and four to his primary campaign on oct 29 1987 
mccain received 112000 in campaign contributions from keating 
and associates and promised to promptly refund any money the 
fec finds was given improperly he previously announced he was 
reimbursing american continental corp the parent company of 
lincoln 13433 for flights the senator and his family took aboard 
keatings corporate plane to and from the bahamas in 198486 
deconcini received 48100 for his 1988 reelection campaign but 
announced he was returning the money 
cranston received 39000 in campaign money he solicited from 
keating 850000 for three voter education projects in california 
and 85000 for the california democratic party 
glenn received 34000 in direct contributions and a political 
action committee associated with him was given 200000 
riegle received 76100 for his 1988 reelection campaign but 
announced he was returning the money

defense secretary dick cheney and top aides 
are crunching the numbers to meet white house demands the 
pentagon hold its spending to around 292 billion during the next 
fiscal year 
the white house in its attempt to meet the grammrudman budget 
cutting targets has informed cheney that military spending wont 
be allowed to keep pace with inflation pentagon sources say 
its going to be a net reduction in real growth meaning an 
increase in actual spending of less than the expected inflation 
rate of 41 percent said a defense source who spoke on condition 
he not be identified by name 
theyre crunching the numbers said another senior pentagon 
official indicating cheney and his aides now must draw up plans to 
deal with the amount of funding the white house will allow 
pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters on wednesday 
that cheney received a figure a day earlier from the white house 
but he declined to discuss it 
the spokesman said the department now must make plans to conform 
with the new figure for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 1990 so 
it may be included in the formal presentation of the presidents 
budget to congress next month 
he said cheney is determined to send a realistic budget to 
congress 
cheney himself has said he does not want his budget labeled 
dead on arrival because it contained unrealistic expectations 
of increased spending 
the debate over the 1991 fiscal years budget comes as the 
pentagon attempts to grapple with nearcertain cuts over the long 
term in light of eased tensions abroad and budgetdeficit problems 
at home 
cheney has ordered the service chiefs to come up with plans that 
could allow up to 180 billion to be trimmed from future projected 
budgets in the years 1992 through 1994 
but house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis 
says the bush administration bungled its announcement of future 
cuts in defense spending by failing to spell out a military 
strategy leaving planners with a dollar figure target but no 
guidance on policy 
the budget exercise asked the services where they would cut 
it didnt tell them what threats to assume what roles to emphasize 
or what missions to minimize aspin said in a speech thursday 
aspin said the cuts cheney has discussed with reporters are 
based on unrealistic budget projections 
under the last budget put out by the reagan administration 
projected military outlays for fiscal 1991 were estimated at 3047 
billion 
in the budget for the present fiscal year pentagon 
appropriations set by congress were 286 billion an increase to 
292 billion would be 21 percent though the 286 billion figure 
is not final 
the administration expects inflation to be 41 percent through 
1990 
the actual amount the department will spend will affect the 
governments 1991 deficit which must meet the grammrudman target 
of 64 billion for the current fiscal year the deficit target 
will range between 100 billion and 105 billion 
meanwhile air force secretary donald rice indicated budget 
pressures may force the service to stretch out purchases of the 
costly b2 stealth bomber 
the pentagon has invested about 23 billion in the program and 
hopes to purchase 132 bombers at a cost of about 70 billion but 
lawmakers profess sticker shock over the price tag estimated 
at 530 million for each plane 
the secretary told reporters he believes all 132 planes are 
necessary and the bomber is an essential part of the pentagons 
plans for nuclear deterrence even if arms control agreements are 
reached with the soviet union in the coming year on conventional 
and strategic nuclear weapons 
we are looking at the option of procuring it over a longer 
period of time were interested in doing that only if it can 
still be done efficiently rice said 
i think 132 is a good number and if it were to be questioned 
it is something that doesnt need to be decided for quite a few 
years to come he added 
in july air force officials told congressmen that stretching 
out purchases over several years could raise the aircrafts price 
considerably

she was charming outgoing vivacious and 
her english was atrocious exfbi agent richard miller recalled 
of the soviet woman who became his lover and led to his conviction 
as a spy 
after five years in prison and reversal of his conviction 
miller conceded his affair with svetlana ogorodnikov was the 
stupidest thing ive done in my life but insisted he never was a 
spy 
i love my country said miller the only fbi agent ever 
convicted of espionage im a patriotic kind of guy i know 
in my heart im not a traitor 
the 52yearold miller released on bail last month pending a 
new trial talked thursday with a group of reporters who had sought 
interviews his lawyers stanley greenberg and joel levine stood 
by to veto any questions about his planned defense but miller 
openly answered most queries 
asked to describe the proudest moment in his fbi career miller 
thought for a few minutes then cited a 1972 trip to washington 
when he and his family had a picture taken with then fbi chief j 
edgar hoover 
that he said was one of the proudest moments 
the former agent was alternately serious and wisecracking he 
called his upcoming third trial miller three it makes me feel 
like rambo 
he spoke of his troubled 20year fbi career his extramarital 
affair with mrs ogorodnikov his return to the mormon faith and 
adjustment to life outside prison 
in prison a person loses one of the most precious things a 
person can lose and that is freedom of choice they tell you when 
to sleep when to eat when to do laundry im having a difficult 
time adjusting to making simple decisions 
his first trial ended in a jury deadlock at his second trial in 
1986 he was convicted of giving his lover a secret fbi reporting 
guide in return for sex money and gold 
his attorneys claim he was a bumbler trying to redeem his 
lackluster career by infiltrating the kgb through mrs ogorodnikov 
a soviet emigre miller still contends that was his misguided 
purpose 
a lot of the time i was a good fbi agent one of the 
exceptions was the stupid idiotic thing i tried to do with 
svetlana it was one of the stupidest things ive done in fact it 
was the stupidest thing ive done in my life 
mrs ogorodnikov and her husband nikolay pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms 
as far as svetlana goes im very sad that she has to spend 
time in prison and i wish her the very best as i would any person 
who was in prison miller said 
he said that his sexual indiscretions with mrs ogorodnikov and 
other women wrecked his career and his marriage 
i probably have more guilt over that than any single thing 
he said ive always tried to be a very moral person and having 
five affairs in two years is not very moral i guess i got 
caught up in the sexual revolution of the 80s 
of his exwife paula mother of his eight children he said 
i felt i betrayed her 
but they remain on good terms and he hopes to get permission to 
spend christmas with her and the children at her home in utah 
miller was excommunicated from his mormon faith for extramarital 
affairs but he said he abides by its precepts 
in april the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned 
millers conviction on grounds the jury should not have been told 
miller failed lie detector tests 
he has a new judge and a trial scheduled for may

loan and junk bond transactions among a group 
of savings institutions including a colorado thrift associated 
with president bushs son are being examined by federal 
authorities for possible improprieties 
sampl regulator m danny wall confirmed to reporters thursday that 
the office of thrift supervision was continuing to look at several 
thrifts which shuffled junk bonds and loans among themselves 
such daisy chains have been used by sampls to hide 
questionable credits from regulators 
the transactions under scrutiny involved lincoln savings and 
loan association irvine calif silverado banking savings and 
loan association denver san jacinto savings association 
bellaire texas and mdc holdings a real estate investment company 
affiliated with silverado 
neil bush the presidents 34yearold son served on the board 
of directors of silverado from 1985 until august 1988 four months 
before regulators declared the sampl insolvent 
the relationship among the institutions raised concern among 
regulators earlier in 1988 according to letters released by the 
house banking committee 
george barclay principal supervisory agent at the federal home 
loan bank of dallas wrote to washington regulators in september 
1988 citing the apparent unhealthy lending relationship among 
the institutions and mdc holdings 
in an october 1988 response to barclay darrel w dochow 
regulatory director of the federal home loan bank system wrote 
please be assured we are very concerned about the pattern of 
activity that we have witnessed between san jacinto lincoln 
silverado and mdc he indicated the securities and exchange 
commission was investigating mdc 
federal authorities are also investigating whether seven 
thrifts including lincoln silverado and san jacinto inflated 
their assets by selling junk bonds to each other at inflated 
prices according to american banker a trade publication 
in a related matter wall said his agency investigated and found 
invalid complaints that silverado was treated leniently because of 
its link to neil bush and to larry mizel the owner of mdc holdings 
and a prominent republican fundraiser 
james moroney a former analyst at the federal home loan bank of 
topeka has alleged silverado was insolvent in 1986 but that 
regulators held off because of its political ties 
in fact wall said silverado was targeted for early regulatory 
action to minimize its losses and was seized in december 1988 
he acknowledged regulatory problems at the topeka bank but said 
moroneys specific allegation lacked substance 
this individual was not involved with silverado he was not 
close to silverado wall said maybe he was smelling smoke but 
that individual didnt have anything 
wall speaking to reporters after a speech to the association of 
government accountants declined to say whether his agency had 
looked into a specific transaction between neil bush and a major 
borrower from silverado however he said we have looked at a 
lot of transactions in and around silverado a bank owned by the 
borrower provided bushs oil and gas company with a 1 million line 
of credit 
a trade publication national thrift and mortgage news has 
reported the fbi is investigating silverado wall confirmed his 
agency made referrals concerning silverado but declined to 
specify if the referrals were to the fbi or justice department

a lawyer for a hispanic officer found guilty of 
manslaughter in the deaths of two black men said he was a fall guy 
used to prevent racial backlash 
a multiethnic jury on thursday found officer william lozano 
guilty of manslaughter in the deaths of motorcyclist clement lloyd 
23 and passenger allan blanchard 24 
attorneys for the colombianborn officer say they will appeal 
obviously the court had its own agenda and we were here for 
justice and not some social engineering or some method of solving 
racial problems in miami said roy black lozanos attorney we 
were here to try to get a fair trial 
circuit judge joseph farina ordered a presentencing 
investigation and set a court date for next month 
the jan 16 shooting sparked three days of racial unrest and 
police feared that an acquittal in the case would bring more 
unrest the guilty verdict set off a celebration by blacks on the 
street where the shooting took place 
miami has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade 
including two riots following acquittals of police charged in the 
deaths of blacks 
there is no doubt there are many people in this town who are 
afraid of any more disturbances black said and if you add up 
the ledgers it is cheaper to send one police officer to jail than 
to pay several million dollars for another riot 
assistant state attorney john hogan said the verdict after 7 
hours of jury deliberations was just 
i dont think we take any particular pleasure in convicting a 
police officer but i think theres a great deal of pleasure 
realizing the system works no matter what is ones profession or 
what his family does said hogan the lead prosecutor 
prosecutors said lozano fired unnecessarily at lloyd who was 
fleeing a police car after a traffic violation blanchard died of 
injuries suffered in the resulting crash lozano claims lloyd tried 
to run him down 
black said the appeal would include his unsuccessful argument 
for a change of venue he noted the verdict was sealed for two 
hours while preparations for any violence were made 
when we got to the courthouse you would think world war iii 
had started black said there were more armed men with 
automatic weapons than ive ever seen in my life and to have a 
trial under circumstances like that is absurd

the department of transportation says the 
government chose a reasonable route to transport damaged fuel 
from the three mile island nuclear plant to idaho despite concerns 
that the cargo crosses too many urban areas 
the dot said in a 47page report this week that the energy 
department made a reasonable choice when evaluated against the 
multiple objective route selection criteria 
however the report also said during the course of planning 
the shipping campaign the energy department did not have 
welldeveloped operational guidelines for route selection 
population exposure was not a significant factor in picking the 
route the report said 
the energy department is 3 years into a program to haul 300000 
pounds of damaged radioactive fuel by train from the crippled tmi 
unit 2 reactor in middletown pa to an idaho laboratory 2400 
miles away 
along the way the fuel passes through ohio indiana illinois 
missouri kansas nebraska colorado and wyoming at the lab the 
material is analyzed by egampg idaho an energy department contractor 
hoping to learn more about the 1979 tmi incident the nations 
worst commercial nuclear accident 
twenty trips each taking about five days have been completed 
by the conrail and union pacific railroads there are expected to 
be two more tmi spokeswoman mary wells said thursday 
the report noted that the energy department encountered 
opposition to the route which passes through several large cities 
pittsburgh indianapolis st louis and kansas city most 
concerns were from the st louis area and to a lesser extent 
pittsburgh areas and by the states of kansas and illinois 
the fuel along with metal debris is contained in canisters 
secured inside layered stainless steel and lead casks designed to 
withstand accidents 
because of its confidence in the casks the energy department 
did not use population exposure as a major determining factor in 
choosing the route dot said 
since the best quality track is usually found on lines 
connecting and traversing large population centers the energy 
department is generally forced to choose between using higher 
quality track and avoiding high population areas the report said 
the dot study was prompted by a request from sen john danforth 
dmo for an independent assessment of the route 
while it found the safety risks acceptable dot said the public 
influenced by the nature of the material apparently perceives a 
risk higher than that based on technical considerations 
however dot also said that energy department poorly documented 
its route selection decisions and lacked proper guidelines 
the energy department said in a news release that this lack of 
documentation does not indicate noncompliance with regulations or 
breach of public safety 
the shipments are part of the overall 1 billion cleanup of the 
tmi reactor

praised the communitys efforts in ridding the playground of drug 
dealers calling it a bright star in our nationwide battle 
against drugs 
but once the cameras and the national press corps left 
neighborhood youngsters returned for a little roundball 
a year to a year and a half ago the kids wouldnt even come 
out to play basketball said officer roy calderon who patrolled 
winzer park thursday theyve really done a good job of cleaning 
it up and getting rid of the drug dealers its better than it used 
to be 
erma scales president of the acres homes war on drugs 
committee told bush the neighbors banded together to end drug 
trafficking in the park calling on police officers and making mass 
strolls through the area 
we have told users and dealers no more will you use this 
park as a drivethrough order for the purchase of illegal 
narcotics she said mr bush this is only a small victory in 
the war on drugs but it is very important to us 
calderon said the neighbors supported police 
that helped a lot any time the officers get a pat on the 
back that gives you the initiative to try and help them crack 
down he said 
although an occasional drug deal may still be made in the park 
or within several blocks of it there is no comparison with the 
activities that once took place there calderon said 
back then every other person out here was selling drugs even 
im surprised at the change calderon said 
city electrical supervisor donnie battenfield said crews 
frequently had to replace lights on the playing fields and 
throughout the park because gangs would smash them 
work crews even required a police escort to the park in 
daylight he said i would still always send two people out here 
because it was just too dangerous he said 
but as battenfield supervised cleanup crews at dusk thursday he 
said the situation has changed dramatically 
and the teenagers noticed the change too 
i dont see them very much anymore smith said of the 
dealers now its people playing basketball and they mostly come 
up here at night 
most of them have moved to abandoned houses and other bad 
areas now said djuan herbert 16

a congressman says the governments 
cholesterol education program may be encouraging widespread use of 
unnecessary and possibly harmful drugs 
rep henry waxman dcalif said differing opinions on the 
risks of high cholesterol by experts at a house health subcommittee 
hearing thursday raises some troubling questions 
thomas j moore a writer whose article in the september issue 
of the atlantic magazine raised concerns over anticholesterol 
programs said he questions the value of the national cholesterol 
education program 
but claude lenfant director of the national heart lung and 
blood institute which helped develop the cholesterol program 
defended the guidelines and said they offer a clear opportunity 
to improve the health of americans 
the programs cholesterol guidelines recommend diet as the 
treatment of choice but if that doesnt work the guidelines say 
patients with high levels of cholesterol should seek treatment with 
drugs 
an estimated 60 million americans are believed to have high 
blood cholesterol a fatty substance essential for life but which 
in high concentrations that can clog arteries and contribute to 
heart disease and heart attacks 
other characteristics associated with heart disease are high 
blood pressure obesity smoking and lack of exercise 
the central question is do we have effective medical treatment 
that justifies putting 60 million people under longterm care of 
their doctor moore said 
moore was joined by medical experts who agreed that all adults 
should keep an eye on cholesterol and diets that are lowfat and 
lowcalorie 
but they also said that although studies show high cholesterol 
levels are a heartdisease risk for middleage men the evidence is 
lacking for men over 65 and for women of all ages who have no 
history of heart disease 
they also maintain diet has been shown to have only a small 
effect on cholesterol and that people generally dont stick to 
special diets when they are not part of a closely supervised 
medical study 
frustration with diets would lead many people to 
cholesterolreducing drugs which they said have side effects that 
include liver damage cataracts and digestive difficulties 
i am troubled by the prospect of subjecting many people to 
lifelong dietary restrictions and potentially hazardous drug 
treatment for the sake of health benefits that may never 
materialize said dr alan m garber of the stanford university 
school of medicine 
lenfant contended the evidence shows that women and the elderly 
as well as middleage men benefit from keeping cholesterol levels 
down 
he also noted that the guidelines recommend dietary changes as a 
first step and said this can reduce cholesterol significantly

a method developed to find buried toxic 
waste is helping scientists dig up what may be the longest 
fossilized dinosaur ever found a 120foot seismosaurus who died in 
a river 145 million years ago 
something big in your neighborhood who ya gonna call 
dinobusters is the slogan inscribed on the tshirt of oak ridge 
national laboratory researcher alan witten who developed the 
dinobusting technique with about 500000 from the us 
department of energy and the army 
the 1 million excavation is under way at a secret site 
northwest of albuquerque nm where wittens technique is used to 
locate buried bones by making fuzzy pictures of them with sound 
waves 
what alan is going to do is bring paleontology out of the 19th 
century by making it faster easier and cheaper to excavate large 
fossils said j wilson bechtel who supervises the dig with his 
wife peggy they direct the southwest paleontology foundation in 
albuquerque 
the tennesseebased witten discussed the dig and his technique 
thursday during the american geophysical unions fall meeting 
witten said the energy department and the armys toxic materials 
agency paid to develop the method so it could be used to find 
buried toxic waste for cleanup check the integrity of potential 
toxic or nuclear waste dumps and perhaps explore for coal seams 
the method is similar to medical ct scans which use xrays and 
detectors to make images of internal organs 
to make images of buried seismosaurus bones witten said he 
sends sound waves through the ground using an 8gauge shotgun on 
wheels pointed down it fires a soft metal slug that hits the 
ground and flattens 
the sound waves are detected by a set of 29 microphones in a 
nearby hole the sound travels at different rates through rock and 
bone to make an image of one part of the dinosaur the gun is 
moved around and fired repeatedly producing a twodimensional 
image of a bones sound shadows 
the method is similar to that used to make holographs witten 
said the sound gun is a commercial kind used to search for oil by 
studying the speed of sound waves bouncing off various underground 
rocks not by making an image he added 
several tail vertebrae from the seismosaurus a relative of 
brontosaurus and diplodocus were discovered by two hikers in 1979 
the exposed bones were excavated in june 1985 by david gillette 
then paleontology curator at the new mexico museum of natural 
history and now utahs state paleontologist 
gillette announced the find in august 1986 coining the name 
seismosaurus or earth shaker 
the seismosaurus lived in a hot humid river delta much like 
todays mississippi and probably laid down on a river sandbar 
and was covered by sand rather rapidly after damming water 
upstream bechtel said 
the dinosaurs bones are still in the position where they were 
when the animal died 
debate continues over whether the seismosaurus or a fossil 
dinosaur found near delta colo is the biggest ever discovered 
gillette said seismosaurus was at least 120 feet long and probably 
longer and brigham young university scientists have said their 
dinosaur was at least 100 feet long and possibly 130 feet 
until the dinosaurs are excavated its all speculation 
said witten 
mrs bechtel said it will take at least one more year to 
excavate the seismosaurus so far the team has removed the base of 
the tail vertebrae pelvis and several ribs from beneath 8 feet of 
sandstone

thousands of people rallied in the 
capital and demanded that the communist government to recognize 
church weddings and reinstate christmas as a holiday 
the gathering was bulgarias first major rally for religious 
freedom in more than four decades 
speakers at the thursday rally called for a change in the 1947 
law curtailing religious freedom complete independence of church 
and state and an end to the monopoly of the state on spiritual 
education 
they also called for official recognition of church weddings and 
reinstatement of christmas and easter as official holidays 
bulgarians have worked on these holidays since 1944 
activists also read aloud the text of three petitions to the 
national assembly demanding religious freedom about 3000 signed 
the papers 
the protest was organized by the society for the defense of 
religious freedom and spiritual values an independent group 
in recent weeks bulgarians have begum emulating the 
prodemocracy movements sweeping other east bloc countries 
bulgarias longtime hardline communist party chief todor zhivkov 
was ousted on nov 10 and replaced by petar mladenov who is 
considered more moderate 
since then the government has scrapped a law forbidding 
dissent dismantled a police squad that cracked down on human 
rights activists and condemned the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia 
in which it took part 
despite those changes the bulgarian orthodox church hierarchy 
has so far remained firmly under control of the ruling communist 
party 
one reason for the emigration of hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
turks from bulgaria earlier this year has been official curbs on 
exercising islamic rites 
important changes in religious legislation are expected at a 
national assembly session starting dec 14

a federal judge has ruled in favor of a labor 
department regulation that allows working at home in five 
apparelrelated industries 
us district court judge gerhard gesells ruling thursday 
rescinds a ban on home work in the industries making gloves and 
mittens handkerchiefs buttons and buckles some types of jewelry 
and embroideries 
gesell said the justice department regulation represents a 
reasoned approach requiring firms seeking to institute home 
work to come forward and seek certification from the government 
they would be subjected to monitoring by department inspectors 
the international ladies garment workers union and two other 
unions sued the secretary of labor last january saying tens of 
thousands of workers would be exploited by the rule and that the 
working standards of other workers would be threatened 
gesell said the concerns of labor unions about workers being 
exploited by home work are no doubt valid a ban on home work 
in seven industries was adopted by the labor department in the 
early 1940s home workers in those industries are normally paid by 
piece rate rather than hourly wages 
the evidence is strong that the conditions present in the 
1940s regarding the exploitation of home workers have not 
disappeared said gesell 
but the judge said the sole issue before the court is 
whether the labor department provided a reasoned basis for 
concluding that a certification system is a better means of 
enforcing federal labor law than a total home work ban

federal highway officials say a new rule 
requires that automobile manufacturers include a government hotline 
number in vehicle owners manuals to encourage car buyers to report 
defects 
a spokeswoman for a consumers group that has been pushing for 
the rule said thursday that the action is a move away from the 
agencys tombstone technology which she said results in action 
being taken only after deaths and injuries occur 
the auto safety hotline in operation since 1975 receives about 
a quarter million calls a year either requesting auto safety 
information or reporting problems 
this requirement will make it easier for consumers to contact 
us to report a safety problem said national highway traffic 
safety administrator jerry r curry 
the rule proscribes three paragraphs that will have to be 
included in manuals for any vehicle manufactured after next sept 
1 including information about the safety agencys powers to order 
defects investigations and recalls but it will note that nhtsa 
cannot get involved in individual problems between you your 
dealer or manufacturer 
the tollfree hotline is 18004249393

canadas justice minister has promised to seek 
tougher gun control laws following the shooting rampage that left 
14 women dead at the university of montreal 
but the official doug lewis showed no inclination to ban the 
type of weapon used by the gunman and he maintained that no 
legislation can guarantee such tragedies will never occur 
you cant legislate against insanity the conservative party 
legislator said thursday 
the mass killing shocked many canadians who have believed that 
carnage on such a scale may have taken place in the united states 
but could not happen in their country 
automatic weapons are banned in canada but semiautomatics are 
available with the proper permit 
some analysts say generally stricter gun control laws in canada 
than in the united states are a factor in a lower crime rate 
lewis promised earlier this year to propose amendments to ban 
the import of military assault rifles such as uzis and ak47s 
but the bill would not ban semiautomatic weapons such as the 
223calibre hunting rifle used in the shootings wednesday which 
also wounded 13 people 
there are many thousands of gun owners who act responsibly 
lewis said semiautomatics are used for sporting purposes 
gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening the 
proposed legislation to cover such weapons 
svend robinson an opposition new democrat legislator he 
criticized lewis for delaying his legislation which has been in 
the works since summer but has not come before house of commons 
how many more tragedies of this nature must we see in this 
country before this conserative government will finally act to 
keep the commitments they made he asked 
robinson said that in addition to banning the import of 
automatic weapons the government should consider tightening the 
rules for gun permits limiting the number of cartridges in the 
clips of semiautomatics and requiring people to take safety 
courses before being allowed to own a gun 
dr john hinchey a surgeon who operated on some of the wounded 
students told a montreal news conference that he supported a ban 
on the type of rifle used in the attack 
earlier prime minister brian mulroney had termed the slayings 
senseless tragic and a grim reminder of the vulnerability of 
our society 
flags on parliament hill were at halfstaff as about 300 people 
gathered just after dark for a candlelight vigil in honor of the 
slain students after speeches by representatives of local womens 
groups they concluded with shouts of no more violence against 
women

the slayings of 14 women by a man who said 
feminists spoiled his life should be seen as the deed of an 
atypical madman for most men understand feminisms benefits 
scholars said 
id hate to say that the vibrant feminist movement in canada 
is the problem because the problem was his not the movements 
said ronnie steinberg a feministsociologist and professor at 
temple university in philadelphia 
certainly many men sometimes find feminism vexing said shawn 
johnston a university of californiadavis forensic psychologist 
who treats sex offenders wife beaters and other violent criminals 
theres no question that masculine insecurity has risen and 
has been associated with the rise in feminism johnston said 
thursday and youve certainly got a lot of crazy or damaged 
angry people out there 
the terrible truth is that there is definitely a history of 
violence toward women that really permeates our western culture 
and that history came to a head wednesday with the killings at 
the university of montreal 
one encounters even among men i would characterize as the 
good guys a sense of frustration sometimes a transitory sense of 
anger johnston said but when decent men have some twinge of 
frustrtion or anger maybe because theyve been passed up for a 
promotion it tends to be fleeting 
my experience has been that most men are quite comfortable 
with and also benefit from female liberation only a small 
percentage of males is going to suffer from the kind of rage and 
unsatisfied power needs or a need to dominate that we have in 
this situation in canada 
marie wilson executive director of the ms foundation for 
women countered that newspapers all too frequently carry stories 
about violence against women 
its all about misogyny and anger but it doesnt get reported 
that way until 14 women get killed all at once she said its 
so much a part of our daily lives as women that even we ignore it 
if you faced it it would make it hard to get up in the morning 
ms steinberg echoed those concerns 
some of us have been concerned for quite a long time that 
were going to be charged with being malehaters because weve 
developed a critical perspective on the treatment of women she 
said citing a debate within the scholarship on domestic violence 
that as other forms of control become less effective men 
increasingly are resorting to violence 
nobody gives up power without a struggle you see the struggle 
over sharing housework comparable worth and affirmative action 
in all those struggles there is a tremendous backlash she said 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
observed in any society when any group tries to move into a 
position of equality and is asking to share power its never given 
willingly 
lives sometimes are lost in such a struggle she said 
now and the national coalition against domestic violence are 
lobbying to include female victims in a proposed hate crime 
statistics act which allows the collection of data about crimes 
based on race religion sexual orientation or ethnicity 
meanwhile said ms steinberg within womens circles we talk 
about how to get our ideas across in such a way as to make it less 
threatening to people 
should feminists have to deal with an increase in masculine 
insecurity johnston said i suppose a trite but nice idea 
would be for us to care a little more for each other 
if men tried a little harder to struggle with the new roles of 
women it would be good and perhaps if feminists who are making 
great strides forward took some time to reflect on some of the 
anxiety it might cause their male counterparts that would be good 
too

an increasing number of women swapping their 
bodies for crack and cocaine are passing on syphilis to their 
newborn babies according to a new report from federal health 
researchers 
last year 691 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in the 
united states up 54 percent from the year before and the highest 
total since the days before penicillin the centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs 
especially cocaine or crack now appears to play a major role in 
the transmission of syphilis the atlantabased cdc said 
thirty to 40 percent of fetuses infected with syphilis are 
stillborn and those who do survive to birth can die soon after 
with syphilis or suffer brain damage developmental problems or 
sight and hearing disorders said dr paul zenker of the cdc 
new york city accounted for 357 of the congenital syphilis cases 
in 1988 more than half the national total birth certificate 
questionnaires and health department interviews showed that 39 
percent of the syphilis babies mothers used cocaine or crack while 
they were pregnant the cdc said 
new york had reported just 57 congenital syphilis cases in 1986 
in the first six months of this year new york health officials 
reported 779 newborns with positive syphilis tests twothirds of 
those cases will probably prove to be actual syphilis infections 
meaning new york alone could report 1000 congenital syphilis cases 
in 1989 cdc researchers said 
syphilis a common sexually transmitted disease can be treated 
in most cases with penicillin or other antibiotics although its 
too late to reverse birth defects in many children born with the 
disease 
syphilis babies may be in double jeopardy because their addicted 
mothers may not access the healthcare system fully depriving 
the babies of the prenatal care they need the cdc said 
only half the mothers in the new york study reported any 
prenatal care visits

nearly 2000 east germans have been moving to 
west germany each day in an exodus that has continued despite their 
new freedom to travel abroad and promises of reform by communist 
leaders in their homeland 
in the first six days of december 11625 east germans 
registered to resettle in their rich western neighbor bringing the 
total number of east german immigrants to about 312000 the west 
german interior ministry said thursday 
under west germanys constitution east germans are granted 
automatic citizenship 
the december exodus is small compared with the 10000 or more 
east germans who left daily via czechoslovakia shortly before east 
germany hoping to stem the flow opened the berlin wall and its 
other borders to west germany on nov 9 
the stream fell to about 1500 a day by late november but picked 
up again during the last two weeks as uncertainty about the 
countrys future increased 
ina ruehl a red cross spokeswoman in bonn said no end to the 
exodus is in sight 
we all thought the trend would be downward but that didnt 
happen she said in a telephone interview the future is 
uncertain of course a lot depends on political developments in 
east germany 
former communist party chief egon krenz ordered travel 
restrictions lifted so citizens wouldnt have to flee but krenz 
has been ousted in the second leadership reshuffle in six weeks 
the government now has promised to grant free elections and 
broad political freedoms 
only a small fraction of the millions of who have visited west 
berlin and west germany after the opening of frontiers decided to 
stay but east germanys struggling economy can not afford the 
steady drain of mostly young educated workers 
shortages of medical personnel already have been reported in 
east germany and an east berlin newspaper warned last week that 
the country faced a collapse of society if the exodus does not 
stop 
berliner zeitung said citizens were leaving because authorities 
were not moving quickly enough against corruption 
about 700 east germans are crossing every day to west berlin a 
noncommunist island in the middle of east germany emergency 
shelters are stretched to the limit and resentment is building 
west berlin said nov 28 it would accept only east germans who 
can prove they are joining parents or children other resettlers 
are being sent to west germany 
the announcement has not reduced the numbers of people coming to 
west berlin said rita hermanns spokeswoman for the citys social 
and health services authority 
we cannot keep all school gymnasiums of this city occupied 
indefinitely she said we would certainly like to use them for 
sports again

the captain of the uss iowa which lost 47 
of its sailors in an april gun turret explosion said his young 
crew rebounded remarkably well from the tragedy 
the battleship returned thursday to the norfolk naval station 
after a sixmonth deployment that took its 1500man crew to the 
baltic north sea and mediterranean the crew had seven weeks to 
prepare for the trip after the explosion that occurred during a 
gunnery exercise off the coast of puerto rico 
no other crew in any navy could overcome a tragedy like the 
one april 19 and do what this crew has done capt fred p 
moosally said 
while the iowa was at sea the navy released its report on the 
explosion 
it found the blast most likely was caused by a disgruntled 
gunners mate who sabotaged the huge gun and died in the explosion 
that report is being challenged by many of the families of the 
47 victims who believe the navy is covering up equipment and 
training failures aboard the world war iiera battleship 
congressional committees will hear testimony next week from navy 
officials and fbi experts 
navy investigators found that sabotage was the only explanation 
for the explosion but the fbi has declined to endorse that 
conclusion because its tests and investigation failed to duplicate 
the navys findings 
moosally is to testify monday before the senate armed services 
committee 
he said the iowas record during the deployment and its ability 
to respond in emergencies showed the worth of the battleship to the 
countrys defense 
the iowas homecoming was vastly more cheerful than its return 
to norfolk in april four days after the explosion this time there 
were bands welcome home signs gaily colored balloons and cheerful 
faces in the crowd of more than 1000 who huddled in the cold 
blustery wind

a new survey finds that hispanic americans on 
the average tend to be heftier than other americans 
the national centers for disease control said thursday a study 
of mexican americans in the west cuban americans in miami and 
puerto ricans in metropolitan new york found overweight problems 
for hispanics were substantially higher than those reported for 
nonhispanic americans 
among mexican americans 30 percent of men and 39 percent of 
women were overweight among cuban americans 29 percent of men and 
34 percent of women were overweight and among the new york puerto 
ricans 25 percent of men and 37 percent of women were overweight 
in another survey the cdc said overweight men among 
nonhispanics accounted for 24 percent of whites and 25 percent of 
blacks among women it was 25 percent of whites and 44 percent of 
blacks 
the cdc said the three surveyed hispanic groups account for 
about threefourths of the hispanic population in the united 
states the survey was not a nationwide one but it is a 
scientifically based sample in those three areas said michael 
rowland a researcher with the national center for health 
statistics a branch of the cdc 
reasons for the trend are pure conjecture said dr david f 
williamson a cdc researcher he noted that hispanic americans in 
general have lower income and education status than do white 
americans and people at the lower end of socioeconomics are at 
greater risk of being overweight this is an especially strong 
pattern among women 
the term overweight in the nchs survey was used for anyone 
whose body mass index a measurement of height and weight 
was in the top 15 percent of men or women in their 20s 
severely overweight indicated the top 5 percent that 
designation applied to between 8 percent to 10 percent of 
hispanicamerican men and 8 percent to 16 percent of 
hispanicamerican women compared with generally lower levels for 
nonhispanics 
the hispanic survey was conducted as part of the nchs hispanic 
health and nutrition examination survey between 198284

a new study linking barrier contraceptives with a 
condition that is the third leading cause of death in pregnancy is 
interesting but preliminary according to the studys author and 
others 
the study which appears in todays journal of the american 
medical association found that women who used barrier 
contraceptives such as diaphragms or condoms were more than twice 
as likely as other women to develop the condition called 
preeclampsia 
preeclampsia occurs in about 7 percent of pregnancies and is 
characterized by high blood pressure fluid retention and protein 
in the urine 
it frequently occurs late in pregnancy and is more common in 
first pregnancies untreated it can lead to maternal seizures and 
in rare cases cause death to either the fetus or the mother 
but the lead researcher cautioned thursday that the results were 
preliminary and that many more studies are needed before final 
conclusions into the cause of the condition are made 
and a doctor who treats highrisk pregnancies said health 
benefits of barrier contraceptives especially condoms probably 
outweigh the risks 
im very concerned with the conclusion that barrier 
contraceptives may be bad for you said dr alan peaceman who 
teaches in the division of maternalfetal medicine at northwestern 
university medical school in chicago 
my concern is that barrier contraception is a very important 
kind of contraception in this country not just for preventing 
pregnancy but for prevention of spreading disease he said 
the health benefit from this form of birth control may still 
outweigh the risks even if they exist 
the causes of preeclampsia also called toxemia remain 
mysterious previous studies have indicated it may be linked to 
such things as a genetic predisposition environmental factors or 
the immune system 
the study by researchers at the university of north carolinas 
school of public health was the first to focus on the relationship 
between all kinds of birth control and preeclampsia 
it found that women who used barrier contraceptives before 
deciding to become pregnant were 237 times as likely to develop 
the condition as those who used other types of birth control 
for research purposes barrier contraceptives included 
diaphragms condoms spermicides and withdrawal nonbarrier 
methods included iuds birth control pills and no birth control 
the study examined 225 women ages 15 to 35 who delivered their 
first child at a north carolina hospital between 1984 and 1987 
of the subjects chosen 110 were picked because they developed 
preeclampsia and the other 115 had not the women were interviewed 
by telephone and their responses compared with their medical 
records 
for women to be classified as users of barrier contraceptives 
they must have used barrier methods exclusively for the entire time 
of their sexual relationship with the childs father 
the authors hypothesized that prior exposure to sperm may have 
some sort of immunologic effect that aids in preventing the 
development of the condition 
women who were exposed to smaller amounts of sperm or fewer 
episodes of sperm exposure were at greater risk of preeclampsia 
lead researcher hillary klonoffcohen said thursday

gov mario cuomo is set to run for a third 
term saying theres nothing else he wants to do at this point in 
his life 
while sidestepping a formal announcement cuomo on thursday 
indicated that he had no plans to skip a reelection bid for new 
york governor next year to prepare for a 1992 race for the 
presidency 
if i had to decide right this moment i know exactly what i 
would do said cuomo in a telephone interview that provided the 
strongest signal to date about his plans the logic is very 
simple 
theres just nothing else i want to do theres just nothing i 
can do thats as important as this i dont have any 
alternatives 
one of the few things that could convince him to change his mind 
was failing health cuomo said adding ive never been in better 
physical condition 
at an earlier news conference in his state capitol office cuomo 
had said he was in no hurry to announce his decision on running for 
reelection im going to use all the time i can it doesnt make 
sense not to he said 
cuomo aides have said they expect him to run for reelection and 
then should he win to consider running for president he has said 
hes yet to give any thought to a 1992 presidential bid 
state republican party chairman j patrick barrett welcomed 
cuomos comments i really hope he does run for reelection 
said barrett i would really like us to have a good go at him

the government will turn over to 
scottish police evidence seized from a palestinian suspected of 
complicity in the bombing of pan am flight 103 
the cabinets decision thursday to release the evidence was a 
formal step needed by investigators to conduct a forensic 
examination of clothing taken during a raid on the home of mohammed 
abu talb 
the district court in the city of uppsala ruled monday that abu 
talb was a suspect in the december 1988 explosion of flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people the court also 
said seizure of evidence from his home was legal 
under swedish law the cabinets approval is necessary to take 
evidence out of sweden 
police removed 15 bags of clothing from his home searching for 
clothing acquired during a trip he made to malta in late 1988 the 
forensic examination would determine if those clothes matched 
clothes from malta in the suitcase that contained the bomb 
abu talb a former member of the palestine popular struggle 
front who has lived in sweden since 1983 is in jail awaiting a 
dec 21 verdict on separate charges of murder and attempted murder 
in connection with four bombings in stockholm copenhagen and 
amsterdam in 1985 and 1986 one person was killed and more than 20 
wounded in those bombings 
an official of the uppsala district court said today that 
british authorities have not asked for abu talbs extradition such 
a request was reported likely to prevent abu talbs release if he 
is acquitted of the bombing charges he faces a maximum life 
sentence

in videotaped testimony former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos refused in 1986 and 1987 to answer 
questions on the alleged use of a slush fund to pay for the murders 
of two antimarcos activists 
the late ruler invoked the fifth amendment privilege against 
selfdiscrimination in a video deposition shown thursday in a 
wrongfuldeath lawsuit filed by the families of silme domingo and 
gene viernes the two were shot june 1981 in the seattle offices of 
the alaska cannery workers union 
the us district court lawsuit claims the murder plot 
originated in manila because the victims who were officers of the 
union were involved in antimarcos activism 
three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that the 
victims had crossed the killers by working to eliminate gang 
influence on work assignments and gambling in alaska fish canneries 
but the suit claims an intelligence slush fund administered by 
the mabuhay corp paid 15000 for the murders the company was 
run by dr leonilo malabed of san francisco 
marcos who died last september had acknowledged malabed was a 
friend but invoked his privilege against selfincrimination when 
asked for specifics of intelligence funding and the mabuhay company 
among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffs 
claim is a mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund under a 
heading for security projects is a may 17 entry for 15000 
the plaintiffs claim former canneryunion president constantine 
baruso whose gun was used in the killings was in san francisco on 
that date to pick up the money baruso who was never criminally 
charged in the murders also invoked the fifth amendment 75 times 
during his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial 
marcos gave depositions during two sessions after he fled to 
hawaii following the february 1986 overthrow of his government 
marcos his widow imelda the philippines government and others 
are defendants in the suit which seeks 30 million in damages 
marcos also would not answer whether the philippines national 
bank was used to channel money to the united states for 
intelligence operations in the late 1970s and 1980s and whether 
funds were provided to conduct acts of physical violence against 
the antimarcos opposition including and up to the use of 
murder political assassination and summary execution 
viernes had visited the philippines shortly before his death and 
met with antimarcos trade unionists marcos was not asked 
specifically whether he knew of viernes but said he was concerned 
about leftist influence on philippine trade unions 
we were aware of the efforts of the leftists or the communists 
to influence labor and use some of the unions as their fronts he 
said 
but he denied labor organizers were arrested or disappeared 
for their activities 
there were no political detainees in my opinion he said 
we never jailed anybody just because of their political 
opinions

unofficial chinese and foreign estimates of the number of deaths 
range up into the thousands with almost all the casualties being 
unarmed citizens killed by soldiers firing into crowds 
at least seven other participants in the beijing demonstrations 
all workers were previously put to death for rioting at least 11 
others in shanghai and chengdu have also been executed for rioting 
during the political turmoil of june 
those receiving the death sentence have the right to appeal but 
appeals are almost always rejected and executions by a bullet to 
the back of the head normally take place within a few days of 
sentencing 
the protest against the us decision to allow students to 
remain in the united states was delivered by vice foreign minister 
liu huaqiu to us embassy charge daffaires lynn pascoe 
it was the third official protest china has made to the united 
states in the past three weeks 
liu said allegations that chinese studying abroad might be 
persecuted upon their return home was utterly groundless 
he said he hoped the united states would cease all actions that 
undermine bilateral educational exchanges and bilateral 
relations 
president bush on nov 30 announced a veto of a congressional 
bill that would permit chinese students to change their visa status 
and remain in the united states if they feared persecution at home 
bush however said he was taking administrative steps that 
would guarantee chinese students the same rights of abode as 
prescribed by congress

soup kitchens and food pantries in new york city 
have multiplied 20 times in eight years and their clients say 
skyhigh rents and a shortage of unskilled jobs are reasons why a 
published report said 
a lot of people have jobs but the rent man takes it all 
said raymond frazier 39 over a plate of pork and beans at the 
community food resource center on west 116th street

programs in the city the number of soup kitchens and food pantries 
has jumped from about 30 in 1981 to about 600 new york newsday 
said in todays editions 
hotline director christina walker said the government is not 
addressing hunger adequately and that the existence of privately 
run food programs may be helping the government get away with it 
were like enablers allowing the government to continue its 
horrible destructive behavior said walker 
people in line for handouts attribute the problem to high rents 
a shortage of unskilled jobs and red tape in getting food stamps 
and other government assistance newsday said 
the hotline a nonprofit group that tells callers where they 
can find food said the majority of people seeking food are not 
homeless but rather the elderly the disabled the unemployed the 
working poor women on welfare and their children

on the street where a miami policeman shot a black 
motorcyclist people danced and drivers honked their horns after a 
jury convicted the officer on manslaughter charges 
police officers with riot gear were on alert in miamis overtown 
section for fear that thursdays outcome in the trial of officer 
william lozano would spark another round of racial unrest instead 
the televised verdict turned a planned protest into a spontaneous 
celebration 
lozano showed no emotion when he heard the guilty verdict on two 
manslaughter counts in the jan 16 deaths of two black men 
motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 and passenger allan blanchard 24 
he faces a maximum sentence of 45 years sentencing was set for 
midjanuary and his attorneys plan an appeal 
lozano who has been suspended with pay may soon lose his job 
police chief perry anderson prepared paperwork for lozanos 
dismissal after the verdict was announced and sent it to department 
lawyers for review the miami herald reported today 
more than likely theyre going to move for his termination 
police spokesman george law said today but he said before lozano 
could be dismissed an investigation must be ordered 
in the innercity overtown neighborhood amid the dancing of 
about 100 blacks evert wright said a black man finally got 
justice it took a long long time but we finally got justice 
for 10 years weve been waiting for at least a token of 
commitment from the justice system said billy hardemon leader 
of people united for justice 
he stood in front of two symbolic silver coffins and stacks of 
signs accusing police and city leaders of racism blacks had 
planned a march on the courthouse if lozano was acquitted 
this conviction sends a clear message to policemen that the 
policeman is not above the law hardemon said 
but many hispanics said the colombianborn lozano 31 was a 
scapegoat used to ward off a riot hundreds of callers jammed phone 
lines at spanishlanguage radio stations to express anger 
they said the justice system in the united states works one 
way for the blacks and another for the hispanic community said 
fernando escobar afternoon news coordinator for wocnam 
directors of two major spanishlanguage radio stations announced 
a campaign to organize listeners to petition the judge for leniency 
in sentencing lozano 
lozano who remains free on 10000 bail said he received an 
unfair trial 
we will continue fighting with the help of the colombian 
community here in miami he said appealing for more money for 
his defense 
the emotions in overtown meanwhile didnt signal a solution to 
longstanding bitterness in the black community several observers 
said 
lozanos shooting of motorcyclist lloyd and the resultant death 
of passenger blanchard in an accident caused three days of rioting 
in january 
the city continues to be racially divided and the potential for 
more trouble remains said irby mcknight of the police crisis 
response team the team was formed with black community leaders 
after racial unrest 20 years ago 
the conditions are still here mcknight said its just 
that this trial apparently is not going to be the spark that sets 
it off 
as of early today there were no reports of violence miami has 
been racked by racial unrest four times this decade including 
riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police charged in 
the deaths of blacks 
the january riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded 
thirteen buildings were set afire others were looted and 372 
people were arrested 
black leaders praised judge joseph farinas decision to allow 
blacks on the jury and to try lozano in miami 
i think the black community is maturing said police chief 
anderson who announced his support for the trials outcome but 
praised his officers soon after the verdict 
some police officers cried when they heard the verdict against 
lozano whose wife and two brothers are also in the department 
many felt he never should have been arrested much less 
convicted said miami police spokesman angelo bitsis 
the police department is like a brotherhood and one of their 
brothers has fallen on hard times now he said

antiapartheid church leaders 
today criticized president fw de klerk for rejecting an 
independent inquiry into allegations of police death squads 
the presidents decision is a further license for the police 
to carry on killing said the south african council of churches 
the de klerk government has denied the people justice 
de klerk on thursday night brushed aside opposition demands for 
an independent inquiry into charges that police took part in death 
squads that killed opponents of the whiteled government 
he said such a special investigation would take too long and 
that countrys regular legal system would do the job just as well 
a judicial inquiry can take months if not years to reach its 
final conclusions de klerk said in the meanwhile a climate 
of suspicion and distrust could develop something the country can 
ill afford at this stage in its history 
several police officers some active and some retired will be 
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until 
investigations or legal proceedings are completed de klerk and 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister said in statements 
released early today 
justice minister kobie coetsee said two former security 
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be 
prosecuted one of them awaits execution for an unrelated murder 
and the other has fled the country 
the government has full confidence that the tried and 
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to 
bring the accused before the court impartially and objectively 
de klerk in response to opposition demands that the investigation 
be conducted outside the law enforcement establishment 
south africas national police have been criticized for failing 
to solve dozens of killings of antigovernment activists since 
1978 antiapartheid leaders say many people believe security 
personnel help plan participate in or cover up such actions 
the council said de klerks claim that a judicial inquiry would 
be too lengthy was cynical and spurious 
how long did the victims of the death squads have to wait 
before the south african government was forced by present 
revelations to even make a pronouncement on the matter the 
statement asked 
three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper 
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death 
squad operations on orders of superiors many of whom still occupy 
high positions in the police 
the former policemen two black and one white said they were 
involved in bombings arson kidnapping robbery and murder in 
south africa and neighboring countries 
one almond nofomela is awaiting execution the others have 
fled but one is reported held by authorities in botswana 
vloks statement about what would be investigated mentioned only 
nofomelas allegations he said a team of senior detectives 
would work with the attorneys general of natal and transvaal 
provinces

novelist alexander solzhenitsyn and other exiled 
soviets could have their citizenship restored if they request it a 
soviet lawmaker said in an interview with the government newspaper 
izvestia 
alexei yeliseyev chairman of the supreme soviets commission on 
citizenship said in the interview published thursday that it was 
not necessary for exiles to return to the soviet union in order to 
get their citizenship restored 
we are ready to solve positively some of the cases right away 
if we have personal applications of those deprived of their 
citizenship he said 
asked if solzhenitsyn could be among those granted restoration 
of citizenship if he requested it yeliseyev said yes 
solzhenitsyn who was stripped of his citizenship and expelled 
from the country in 1974 has not requested that his citizenship be 
restored 
the author who now lives in the us state of vermont wrote 
extensively about the bloody terror of stalins rule from 1924 to 
1953 his best known works include gulag archipelago one day 
in the life of ivan denisovich and cancer ward 
yeliseyev said there had been some suggestions that solzhenitsyn 
and other exiled soviets have their citizenship restored by decree 
it would be unfair to restore their citizenship without asking if 
they want it or not he said 
in saying that many exiles could have their citizenship 
restored yeliseyev said we have to adapt to civilized 
standards 
several deputies in the supreme soviet have asked that 
solzhenitsyns citizenship be restored but no official action has 
been taken 
earlier this year the soviet writers union restored the 
membership of solzhenitsyn and mstislav rostropovich a musician

a man who killed 14 women at the university of 
montreal had a deep fear of being rejected by women and once hoped 
to attend the engineering school where he carried out his suicidal 
rampage police say 
the bizarre shooting spree by marc lepine described as a bright 
but jobless loner who had an apparent hatred for women in general 
and feminists in particular sparked new calls to tighten canadas 
weapons laws 
armed with a semiautomatic rifle the 25yearold lepine walked 
through the engineering school wednesday afternoon singling out 
women and shooting them he killed 14 and wounded nine plus 
wounded four men before killing himself 
police found a threepage suicide note that blamed feminists for 
his troubles they pieced together a troubling profile of a man 
whose father ran out on the family when he was a boy whose life 
was a succession of failures 
the modern university that rests on a hill overlooking the city 
was stunned after the massacre the worst mass slayings in canadian 
history about 2000 mourners held a wrenching candlelight vigil 
thursday evening in montreal and people held memorials for the 
dead in ottawa toronto and edmonton alberta 
the school was closed thursday in mourning final exams set for 
thursday were pushed back four days 
police spent more than a day trying to confirm the identity of 
the killer who signed his handwritten suicide note only as 
marc 
police spokesman andre tessier told a news conference thursday 
night that lepine had trouble developing relationships with women 
and broke off all communication at the first sign of rejection 
if things werent going well with a woman he would just stop 
the relationship right there and never come back to the person he 
was talking with said jacques duchesneau a police investigator 
he didnt have any girlfriends the detective said 
i think he blamed women in general saying that if his life 
was ruined it was mainly because of women duchesneau said 
duchesneau said the lepines letter included a list of 15 quebec 
women some of them prominent but the significance was not clear 
he only gave a list of names period the detective said 
were trying to figure why those names were chosen 
duchesneau who said the information about lepine came from 
numerous sources said lepine was fascinated by war movies his 
suicide note said he tried to join the armed forces but was 
rejected because he was antisocial 
duchesneau described lepine as intelligent but added he had 
suffered a number of academic setbacks and had been fired from a 
job in a montrealarea hospital 
lepine had taken courses with the aim of entering the 
engineering school of the university of montreal but there was no 
indication he applied there tessier said 
police said that according to the suicide letter lepine said he 
was going to commit the massacre because feminists have always 
ruined my life 
the letter also made a reference to another mass murderer cpl 
denis lortie jailed for life for the killing of three people and 
wounding of 13 in the quebec legislature in 1984 
according to duchesneau lepines letter said lortie had made a 
political statement and that lepine believed he was only doing 
what mr lortie did 
the officials said the mans name at birth was gamil gharbi but 
he took his mothers surname and the name marc in 1982 his 
algerian father who now lives abroad had left the family when 
lepine was 7 years old 
police said lepines mother and sister still live in montreal 
and they said he had lived with a male friend 
lepine bought the 223calibre sturm ruger the semiautomatic 
rifle he used in a hunting store on nov 21 the police spokesmen 
said 
in ottawa justice minister doug lewis said he would move to ban 
the import of military assault rifles such as uzis and ak47s but 
not the hunting rifle used by the gunman 
automatic weapons are banned in canada but semiautomatics are 
available with the proper permit 
police said the gunman first shot a woman in a secondfloor 
corridor then entered a room on that floor where a class with 
about 50 male and 10 female students was in session 
witnesses said he told the class to separate by sex and sent the 
men into the corridor before opening fire on the women killing 
six police said he then went to the first floor killed three 
women in a cafeteria then entered a thirdfloor classroom where he 
killed four women and then himself

second day and the 120000 people of nablus the west banks 
largest city were ordered to remain at home for an eighth day

and 6000 residents in kalandia refugee camp near jerusalem 
two people were shot and wounded in gaza for violating the 
curfew according to arab reports 
about 300 palestinians demonstrated in jerusalems old city 
outside the al aqsa mosque one of islams holiest sites chanting 
plo israel no and waving outlawed palestinian flags arab 
witnesses said 
the demonstrators carried signs from the plo and the moslem 
fundamentalist group hamas or zeal congratulations to the 
intefadeh one placard read police stationed on nearby rooftops 
did not intervene and the demonstration ended quietly the 
witnesses said 
jewish settlers drove through the west bank hanging 
blueandwhite israeli flags from utility poles and scrawling 
slogans on arabowned homes to assert their right to the disputed 
land 
we will fight to the end said one slogan written in hebrew 
on a wall in bethlehem 
border police were seen removing the flags and painting over the 
settlers graffiti despite shouted protests from israelis driving 
through bethlehem from settlements to jerusalem 
israels four senior leaders met today in jerusalem and agreed 
to us secretary of state james a baker iiis proposal for a 
meeting with his israeli and egyptian counterparts as a first step 
in the middle east peace process 
baker urged such a meeting in washington to lead to 
israelipalestinian talks on israels proposal for elections in the 
occupied territories 
cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein said the leaders of the 
coalition government agreed to send foreign minister moshe arens to 
the meeting but wanted preliminary talks first to decide the time 
and whether it would be in washington

and arens of the rightwing likud bloc and finance minister shimon 
peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin of the centerleft labor

occupied lands to elect representatives for talks with israel about

guarantee eventual palestinian statehood the main aim of the 
rebellion 
the intefadeh as the uprising is called in arabic began dec 
8 1987 with riots in the jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza strip 
the violence was set off when an army truck collided with a van 
killing four palestinians rumors spread through the camp that it 
was no accident but instead revenge for the stabbing death of a 
jewish businessman three days earlier 
the next day soldiers opened fire on protesting students in the 
camp after a firebomb was hurled at an army patrol 
two palestinians were killed the first of 626 to die in the 
uprising fortythree israelis have also died in the violence and 
155 other palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs as suspected

greeting cards that blend hannukah and christmas 
religious symbols are objectionable say two groups representing 
christians and jews 
the american jewish committee and the national conference of 
christians and jews criticized such mixed cards as an affront to 
judaism to christianity and to serious interfaith relations 
to combine the religious and cultural symbols of hannukah and 
christmas in greeting card art is to diminish the sacred symbols of 
each faith the organizations said wednesday in a statement 
released by the ajc 
greeting cards that mingle santas and menorahs angels trees 
stockings and stars of david are objectionable the statement 
said 
my concern is that people are going to say well there are 
these two winter holidays whats the difference between them 
lets send out a kind of greeting card that will bridge the two 
said judith banki deputy director of the ajcs interreligious 
affairs department 
banki stressing that the groups aim to raise peoples 
consciousness and not accuse any particular company cited three 
examples she found in a store

president bush is voicing strong nostrings 
support for philippine president corazon aquino but other us 
backers say she must act firmly to regain control in the wake of a 
failed coup if she is to restore confidence and keep alive the 
economic growth key to her countrys future 
departing from the prepared text of a speech at a political 
fundraiser in houston on thursday night the president said 
just last week democracy was challenged in the philippines 
and we stood with president aquino and we continue to stand with 
her and with democracy now we must not let the democratic process 
be overthrown by revolution and by military takeover 
obviously we would like to see the aquino government be able 
to solidify its position to avoid a repetition of this house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said after a white house meeting 
with bush earlier thursday 
were sympathetic to her as a democratically elected leader 
and we hope that she can take whatever action is necessary to 
ensure that this kind of open military challenge does not 
reoccur said foley reflecting the discomfort many us 
officials felt over the surprisingly strong coup attempt 
the philippines struggling with widespread rural poverty and a 
28 billion international debt has pinned its hopes on attracting 
outside capital and trade with japan leading the way the country 
has benefited from a multibilliondollar international economic 
development program 
but those hopes which have grown during the 3 years since mrs 
aquino was elected to replace dictator ferdinand marcos rest 
heavily on political stability 
mrs aquino herself has been dogged by accusations of 
incompetence and her government by charges it has failed to weed 
out corruption and address rural poverty 
one congressional official closely involved in us policy 
toward the philippines said any hesitancy on mrs aquinos part in 
dealing with dissident military officers who carried out the coup 
could damage economic growth 
if she is seen as vacillating and not moving vigorously 
against the coup plotters that is really going to be a blow to 
investor confidence said the official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
mrs aquino must do more than she did in 1987 when coup leaders 
generally went unpunished and the government made concessions to 
the rebellious military faction the official said 
the only conclusion for investors is that if she doesnt move 
against these guys they could do it again and next time they 
might succeed he said 
these events will slow things down in the minds of at least 
some potential investors said john callebaut director of the 
usphilippine business committee an arm of the us chamber of 
commerce 
but callebaut said that during a tour the past two weeks to 
interest us electronics companies in investing in the 
philippines he saw little change in attitude because of the 
attempted coup the companies have a longerterm interest in the 
philippines and there is a recognition that this is of a 
shortterm nature he said 
at the white house and the state department there were 
reassurances thursday of us backing for mrs aquino 
mrs aquinos government has shown incredible resilience in 
this situation said state department spokesman richard boucher 
he noted that after a serious coup attempt in august 1987 there 
were pessimistic predictions about investor confidence which never 
came true stability returned rather quickly with an annual 
growth rate of 6 percent boucher said 
but another department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity acknowledged the latest coup will give pause to 
companies contemplating expanding to the philippines 
in addition to being disruptive and destructive and unhealthy 
for the democratic process it raises questions in peoples minds 
is the environment stable is the situation secure is this a good 
place to put money the official said 
she already had a tough job and its become tougher but its 
not impossible

senior israeli officials said today that iraqs 
reported launch of longrange missiles capable of carrying 
satellites into space could be dangerous for the region 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity expressed 
concern that president saddam husseins regime could use such 
missiles for chemical biological or nuclear warheads 
iraqi radio announced on thursday that a threestage rocket was 
launched tuesday morning from the al anbar space research center 50 
miles west of baghdad it said the missiles had a range of 1240 
miles 
an israeli military source confirmed there was a launching but 
gave no details its true but the implications are not yet 
clear said the source who demanded anonymity 
the us state department said it had heard reports iraq had 
developed intercontinental ballistic missile but knew nothing about 
their validity 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs government issued no formal 
statement but officials said privately that an enhanced iraqi 
missile capability would have a destabilizing effect on the region 
it could lead to a dangerous situation said one official 
adding israel might raise the issue in its diplomatic contacts 
israel is following with concern the development of 
unconventional armament in the arab world in general and in iraq in 
particular the official said iraq has a record of using 
indiscriminately all kinds of unconventional weapons chemical and 
other 
israeli officials refused to reply to questions about whether 
preemptive action might be necessary to forestall development of an 
iraqi missile in june 1981 israeli planes destroyed the osirak 
atomic plant being built near baghdad to prevent hussein from 
developing a nuclear weapons capability 
independent analysts said iraqs launching could trigger a 
missile race in the region but they said baghdad still had a long 
way to go before it could put a spy satellite in space or threaten 
israels technological supremacy 
gerald steinberg a weapons systems expert at hebrew university 
told israel radio that optical systems telemetry and other 
sophisticated systems for a satellite are almost completely 
beyond the iraqi capability now and in the near future 
he said the launching may have been primarily to boost iraqs 
image in which case the military impact would be minimal 
but he said it could mean iraq has developed the ability to 
produce and deploy its own missiles five or 10 years faster than 
expected 
israel launched its own satellite called ofek horizon1 on 
sept 19 1988 and is reportedly working on a second

french mercenary bob denard and 
his corps of european soldiers who now control the coromo islands 
are likely to leave within a month because of domestic and foreign 
pressure a south african diplomat said today 
marco boni south africas trade representative noted that both 
south africa and france the largest donors of aid to the indian 
ocean nation had suspended all assistance 
i think denard knows he has to go boni said in an 
interview the joint south africanfrench action should be an 
indication that it is time for him to leave 
various diplomatic sources have alleged that denard or his men 
were involved in the nov 26 assassination of president ahmed 
abdallah abderrahmane denard 60 has denied the allegation and 
insisted that he will not be forced from the islands located off 
the southeast coast of africa near madagascar 
a mass rally against denard has been planned for saturday at the 
main mosque in moroni on thursday 1000 youths protested in the 
capital against denard and the mercenaryled presidential guard 
dispersed them with tear gas and clubs 
boni said denards presence would make it difficult for the 
country to hold free elections to choose a new president 
he said south african officials had not negotiated with denard 
about possible exile in south africa but might offer him temporary 
refuge there he said denard owned a home in south africa 
on thursday the mercenaries expelled 11 foreign correspondents 
after seizing their notebooks film and cassette tapes and accusing 
them of inciting antigovernment demonstrations 
they confined the journalists to their hotel in moroni for four 
hours before driving them to the airport for an air france flight 
to nairobi said gary streiker one of the expelled reporters he 
is the nairobibased africa correspondent for the american 
television cable news network 
those expelled thursday included reporters for cnn the reuters 
and agence francepresse news agencies the daily telegraph of 
london radio france internationale and the sygma photo news 
agency said streiker 
denard has not made any public statement on what he is doing or 
why boni said denard told him that if the people demanded he 
should leave he would 
denard has lived in the comoros for 16 years married a local 
woman and adopted the national religion islam he also has 
extensive property holdings 
he has denied reports that he was involved in abdallahs death 
but sources told the associated press that the two men had 
quarreled recently in particular over continued funding of the 
presidential guard which has given denard his power and influence 
in the islands 
denard led a coup in 1975 that ousted abdallah from power 
shortly after the comoran president declared independence from 
france 
in 1978 with the blessing of the french and south african 
government denard led another coup which brought abdallah back to 
power ending the chaotic maoist rule of ali soilij who was shot 
to death

the new yorkbased loral corp pleaded 
guilty to three felony counts today for its attempts to influence 
improperly the award of two defense contracts 
the company admitted that it paid defense consultant william m 
galvin 578000 to obtain confidential bid information about an air 
force advanced radar warning contract and a navy contract to build 
a blimp 
the company agreed to pay 577 million in fines civil 
penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation a 
plea agreement between the justice department and loral was 
approved by us district judge claude hilton 
meanwhile a former sperry corp official admitted approving 
bribes to a former navy procurement official garland l tomlin jr 
james j thompson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery and 
faces a possible 25year sentence 
the loral admission implicated two former pentagon officials who 
have not been charged in the justice departments continuing 
investigation of defense fraud nicknamed operation ill wind 
according to a statement of facts filed by prosecutors former 
air force procurement official victor d cohen gave galvin inside 
information about the advanced radar warning system for f16 
aircraft 
melvyn r paisley then an assistant navy secretary for research 
engineering and systems provided galvin with information about the 
navy airship contract according to the statement 
paisley also made modifications in bid requirements that were 
favorable to the companys bid the statement said 
loral had obtained the airship division from goodyear tire and 
rubber co the scheme to improperly influence the airship contract 
began before the defense industry division had been obtained from 
goodyear 
galvin who has not been charged relayed information to loral 
officials about both contracts that he had obtained from his 
pentagon contacts according to the statement loral admitted that 
it billed the government for the money it paid galvins companies 
by submitting bogus vouchers for defense studies it falsely claimed 
galvin was conducting 
in a statement the company said it had suspended two 
individuals it did not identify and had disciplined two others 
this regrettable incident should not have occurred at loral 
said bernard l schwartz the companys chairman and chief 
executive officer we are satisfied that loral has procedures and 
controls in place to provide the best protection from anything like 
this occurring again 
as part of the deal loral will retain the radar warning 
contract but must bear a greater share of the cost overruns 
a 1992 procurement for some 70 million worth of radar warning 
equipment will now be placed for competitive bidding 
hilton meanwhile scheduled thompsons sentencing for feb 16 
the former sperry official admitted that he approved payments to 
tomlin after another sperry official frank lavelle suggested the 
arrangement 
the bribery scheme was also known to charles f gardner a 
former vice president of sperry and its successor unisys corp 
gardner has pleaded guilty for his role in the pentagon procurement 
scandal 
tomlin who has returned most of the money he received in 
bribes received an 18month sentence for his guilty plea

the unemployment rate edged up from 53 
percent to 54 percent in november even though the economy added 
210000 new jobs and manufacturing employment fell for the eighth 
consecutive month the government said today 
the labor department report showed job growth last month was far 
greater than most analysts expected but the government also 
revised downward sharply the number of new nonfarm jobs created in 
october from 233000 to 93000 
the civilian unemployment rate climbed 01 percentage point as 
more than 67 million americans were looking for jobs but unable to 
find them that data comes from the departments household survey 
which also showed that 1177 million people held jobs in the 
civilian economy 
the stock market reacted favorably to the report taking the 
evidence of sluggish growth as a sign the federal reserve board 
would move to further relax its credit policy and thus lower 
interest rates 
analysts however were split on whether or when such a 
reduction would come and at odds as well over whether the economy 
was on the verge of recession 
i dont think these numbers suggest further easing said 
washington economist michael evans the economy is moving along 
in second gear its not very weak and its not very strong 
but allen sinai chief economist for boston co economic 
advisers said the manufacturing sector was clearly in a recession 
and appeared to be having a spillover effect on certain services 
industries that could bring a full recession 
i think this is it sinai said this economy is at or near 
some sort of recession he predicted the fed would reduce 
interest rates but said it was unclear whether the central bank 
would move immediately or wait until its yearend meeting in 10 
days 
the manufacturing slump has contributed to the overall slowdown 
in the economy as the year draws to a close and todays report 
provided further evidence that the sectors lackluster performance 
continues 
the average manufacturing work week fell from 408 to 407 hours 
and overtime was unchanged at an average of 37 hours a week 
the department said the dramatic revision of octobers job 
growth number resulted from overestimating new hiring in state and 
local educational institutions which is difficult to measure as 
the school year begins 
with that revision taken into account the government said the 
average monthtomonth gain in jobs during the second half of 1989 
has been about 160000 well below the average monthly gain of 
270000 posted in the past 2 years 
virtually all of the growth in the past year has been in the 
service sector and november was no exception 
wholesale and retail trade posted job gains of 18000 and 
33000 respectively last month and business and health services 
also reported significant payroll expansions 
but the outlook in the goodsproducing sector particularly 
manufacturing was not as good 
mining and construction reported modest employment gains last 
month adding 7000 and 17000 positions respectively 
exacerbating the decline in manufacturing was another bad month 
for automobile manufacturing which reported a decline of 15000 
jobs in november after losing 10000 from september to october 
that decline caused overall employment in the durablegoods 
sector of manufacturing to slip by 24000 jobs last month 
the labor department said manufacturing employment has declined 
by 165000 since march with auto and electrical equipment 
accounting for 100000 of the lost jobs 
analysts had predicted the report would show about 150000 new 
jobs last month and the larger figure would appear to indicate 
that the economy is strong enough that the federal reserve need not 
reduce interest rates further 
the sharp october job revision however and the continued slump 
in manufacturing could give the fed policymakers enough evidence 
that the slowdown has reached a dangerous point and that lower 
interest rates might help spark more robust growth 
the central banks chief concern about easing interest rates 
centers on inflation and todays report contained somewhat 
encouraging news on that front 
average hourly earnings were unchanged in november and average 
weekly earnings declined by 04 percent over the year hourly 
earnings have increased by 36 percent and average weekly earnings 
by 30 percent both of those gains lag well behind consumer 
inflation which has been in the annual range of 45 percent 
the 54 percent civilian jobless rate was the highest since it 
was 54 percent in january for the past six months the rate had 
been either 53 percent or 52 percent 
the rate increased despite the moderately strong addition of 
210000 nonfarm jobs because the labor force those with jobs or 
actively seeking them expanded by 410000 people last month after 
growing by just 65000 from september to october 
the unemployment rates among major demographic groups changed 
little for the most part in november although joblessness for all 
teenagers shot up from 149 percent to 155 percent 
the rates among other groups were 
adult white men 40 percent up from 38 percent in october 
adult white women 40 percent unchanged 
white teenagers 112 percent up from 104 percent 
all blacks 121 percent up from 118 percent 
adult black men 107 percent up from 103 percent 
adult black women 104 percent up from 10 percent 
black teenagers 326 percent down from 361 percent 
hispanics 78 percent down from 79 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed forces stationed in the united states the labor 
department said the november unemployment rate was 53 percent up 
from 52 percent in october

heroin dealers in the san gabriel valley evidence at the trial 
indicated that the agents were killed as part of a scheme to rob 
them of 80000 they had agreed to pay for two pounds of heroin

the soviet union and south korea 
established a consular relationship friday in a first step toward 
formal diplomatic ties 
foreign minister choi hojoong said the consular ties although 
limited would help the two former adversaries to strengthen 
relations in economic and other fields 
after a series of consulations in moscow and singapore the two 
countries agreed to establish consular departments in their 
semiofficial trade offices opened this year a ministry statement 
said 
the consular departments will operate as part of the trade 
offices but will be staffed by officials from the two coutnries 
foreign ministries the statement said 
vice foreign minister hong soonyoung said seoul had to agree on 
the new form of consular ties because of moscows close alliance 
with north korea which is south koreas bitter adversary 
most of all the announcement reflects a rapid change in 
progress in economic and other fields between the two countries 
and in the long run it shows that the chances of formal ties are 
not remote hong said 
he said seouls improved relations with the soviet union would 
positively affect south koreas efforts to establish formal 
relations with china and other socialist countries 
valeriy nazarov chief of the soviet trade office in seoul 
welcomed the decision saying it is a result of growing ties 
between the two countries in the fields of trade sports and 
culture 
he said however that the two countries would not establish 
formal ties in the near future 
nazarov said the soviet union has to honor its friendly 
relations with north korea the soviet union backed north korea 
during the 195053 korean war and continues to supply arms to the 
pyongyang government 
since world war ii seoul has regarded the soviet union as an 
enemy country 
there have been many recent nonpolitical contacts between the 
two countries the soviet union attended the 1988 seoul olympics 
and the two swapped trade offices this year 
south korea also has improved relations with other socialist 
countries hungary and poland formally recognized south korea this 
year yugoslavia is expected to do so later this month and 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria have exchanged trade offices with seoul 
trade between south korea and the soviet union reached 432 
million in the first 10 months of this year up 156 percent from 
the corresponding period last year 
korean exports to the soviet union quardrupled from 25 million 
to 101 million during the 10month period koreas imports from 
the soviet union in the same period rose from 144 million to 331 
million 
south koreas major exports include textiles electronic 
appliances steel and ships it imports coal timber fish and 
agricultural products from the soviet union

china filed a third protest friday expressing its 
utmost indignation over washingtons actions to allow chinese 
students fearing persecution at home to extend their stays in the 
united states 
the protest delivered by vice foreign minister liu huaqiu to 
us embassy charge daffaires lynn pascoe was the third given to 
the united states in the past three weeks 
the us action undermines the educational exchanges between 
the two countries and sinous relations as a whole and i am 
ordered to express our utmost indignation and lodge a strong 
protest with the us government the official xinhua news agency 
quoted liu as saying 
allegations that chinese students might be persecuted upon their 
return home was utterly groundless liu said 
president bush on nov 30 announced a pocket veto of a 
congressional bill that would permit chinese students to change 
their visa status and remain in the united states if they feared 
persecution at home 
bush however said he was taking administrative steps that 
would guarantee chinese students the same rights of abode as 
prescribed by congress 
also on friday the state education commission said bushs 
actions violated a 1987 bilateral agreement requiring chinese 
students to return home for at least two years following the 
completion of their studies in the united states 
due to us violation of the sinous agreement on 
educational exchanges and its obstruction of normal student 
exchanges the state education commission of the peoples republic 
of china has to make necessary responses and the us will be held 
responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom 
the statement did not say whether necessary responses might 
include a halt in sending students to the united states nearly 
half of the estimated 80000 chinese studying abroad are in the 
united states 
on nov 19 china protested the congressional legislation 
eventually shelved that would have toughened economic sanctions 
imposed by the white house after the military crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in june 
the next week pascoe was called into the foreign ministry to 
receive a protest over the passage in congress of the bill on 
student visas 
relations between the two countries are at their lowest point 
since the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1979 both sides have 
expressed hopes that problems can be overcome while at the same 
time insisting that the other side act first in remedying the 
conflict 
china has accused the united states of meddling in its internal 
affairs by imposing sanctions and coming to the defense of chinese 
who advocate democratic reforms 
thousands of chinese students in the united states and other 
countries joined prodemocracy demonstrations and protested 
beijings violent suppression of dissent 
australia said friday it will allow chinese nationals in the 
country illegally including students who have finished their 
studies to stay until at least jan 31 1991

of 39 crew members from two large container ships that disappeared 
after sending out distress signals while battling a fierce storm in 
the gulf of st lawrence 
a coast guard vessel battling twostory seas and high winds 
picked up two empty life rafts and the wreckage of a third near the 
area where the ships ran into trouble it did not see either ship 
or any survivors 
there is wreckage said lieut jeff agnew a search and 
rescue spokesman hopefully well find a lifeboat yet 
roy jones chief engineer of the sir wildred grenfell coast 
guard ship said earlier that at least two bodies were seen 
floating in the gulf but agnew said that was based on an 
inaccurate report from a search plane 
the 280foot johanna b carrying a crew of 16 disappeared off 
radar screens on thursday night 
the 23member crew of the capitiane torres abandoned ship and 
took to an enclosed rubber life raft before their 375foot ship 
capsized or sank 
winds blowing up to 80 mph hampered rescue efforts earlier 
capt patrick phelan of the halifax search and rescue center had 
said rescuers spotted survivors inside the raft but that turned 
out to be inaccurate too 
were talking like 30foot seas heavy winds freezing spray 
possibility of some snow a rescue spokesman said visibility 
is about a quarter of a mile 
rescuers had lost radio contact with the johanna b a 
panamanianregistered vessel carrying a cargo of steel ingots the 
ship declared a mayday after reporting that it was taking in water 
thursday night about 120 miles northeast of summerside prince 
edward island phelan said

to list badly it had been en route to taiwan with general 
container cargo

unemployment climbed to a 10month high of 54 
percent in november and manufacturing payrolls shrunk for the 
eighth consecutive month the government said friday in a report 
many analysts said showed the economy was flirting with recession 
the increase in the civilian jobless rate from 53 percent to 
54 percent came despite the addition of 210000 nonfarm jobs last 
month because of a big jump in the number of americans looking for 
work 
the stock market reacted favorably to the data taking evidence 
of sluggishness as an indication the federal reserve would seek to 
spur the economy by easing its hold on credit before the end of the 
year thus lowering interest rates 
the 210000 new nonfarm jobs reported by the labor department 
was in itself a moderately strong number but the government also 
sharply cut its job growth figures for october from 233000 to 
93000 
that brought the average monthtomonth job gain for the second 
half of the year to about 160000 well off the average monthly 
gain of 270000 for the previous 2 years all of the new jobs have 
been in the service side of the economy manufacturing employment 
is down 165000 since march 
what it means is the economy is weaker than we had previously 
thought said elliott platt a senior vice president at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp were not in a 
recession yet but were perilously close in this quarter and 
probably going to be perilously close in the first quarter next 
year 
indeed chief economist allen sinai at boston co economic 
advisers said the economy might already be in recession and at best 
was near and certainly headed for one 
they and others predicted the fed would relax its credit policy 
but not all analysts shared that view 
the economy is kind of moving along in second gear said 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm its not 
very weak and its not very strong i dont think these numbers 
suggest further easing 
the unemployment rate has not been 54 percent since january 
the increase came despite the job growth because the civilian labor 
force those looking for work and those with jobs grew by 
410000 to 1245 million with 1177 million of them holding jobs 
the labor department said the huge revision of the october 
jobgrowth figure stemmed from overestimating the number of 
teaching and other school jobs added this fall that revision 
contributed to the reported decline in the number of local 
government jobs last month 
elsewhere in the service sector which has been carrying the 
economy wholesale and retail trade posted gains of 18000 and 
33000 jobs respectively health services added 40000 positions 
and business services added 13000 positions 
employment in business services dipped in october and many 
analysts interpreted the only modest rebound in november as 
evidence that demand for temporary workers janitorial and other 
services might be slipping because of the manufacturing slump 
the department said manufacturing employment was down 27000 in 
november with all but 3000 of the decline coming in the 
durablegoods sector the biggest problem area there is in 
automobile manufacturing which lost 15000 jobs last month after 
losing 10000 in october 
adding to evidence of a severe manufacturing slump the 
government said the average factory work week fell from 408 to 
407 hours and overtime was unchanged at an average of 37 hours a

prosecutors said today they have filed 
criminal charges against former communist party chief erich 
honecker and five other ousted officials accused of using their 
power to rob the state and live in luxury 
the communist partys official newspaper said the party must 
make a new start if it is to survive the growing challenge to its 
authority it said many members favor dissolving it in favor of a 
socialist movement 
in a bid to hold onto power the party thursday bowed to the 
opposition and agreed to rewrite the constitution and hold free 
elections in may 
the concessions preceded a crucial party congress that opened 
tonight in east berlin party leaders were expected to choose their 
third party leader in three months and radically alter the party 
structure 
the meeting comes amid mounting civil unrest in east germany and 
political upheaval in other east bloc countries 
in czechoslovakia the new premier marian calfa met with 
opposition leaders today about forming a coalition government in a 
bid to head off a general strike threatened monday if 
noncommunists are not given more power 
the soviet unions central committee scheduled an extraordinary 
session saturday and a journalist said it may discuss the growing 
challenge to the soviet partys authority in particular 
lithuanias decision thursday to revoke the communist partys 
guaranteed monopoly on power 
prosecution spokesman peter przybylski told reporters formal 
charges were filed against honecker former premier willi stoph 
and four other exleaders ousted in the nationwide prodemocracy 
movement 
they are accused of damaging the economy of the german 
democratic republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuse 
of office and corruption the spokesman told reporters 
he said the officials homes were searched but did not say when 
the charges were filed or when a trial would occur 
four of the six are in prison the 77yearold honecker ousted 
from power oct 18 is too sick to be jailed and former politburo 
member hermann axen is having an eye operation in moscow 
przybylski said 
in addition to stoph those under arrest are former politburo 
members guenther kleiber werner krolikowski and erich mielke he 
said 
two months of political upheaval in east germany set into motion 
investigations into abuses of power by the ousted communist elite 
whose members allegedly used their high positions to live in luxury 
off the state 
honecker has been under house arrest in the lavish residential 
compound where he and other politburo members lived 
in a detailed program published thursday the communist party 
that ruled with orthodox communism for four decades called for an 
alternative democratic socialism and admitted its role in the 
current political crisis 
it also recognized the role of the church but it maintained the 
past party line of opposing reunification with west germany 
party and opposition delegations also agreed to recommend that 
parliament schedule elections may 6 
there was speculation the party would even change its name as 
hungarian communists did this year 
neues deutschland the official communist party newspaper said 
today a new start for the party is indispensable even 
vital 
not a few comrades see the solution practically in the 
dissolution of the sed communist party and the new founding of a 
modern socialist party movement the paper said 
the chairman of the national democratic party one of several 
long allied with the communists was quoted as proposing the top 
administrator of the berlin church district manfred stolpe for 
state president 
parliament should elect a president after national elections 
party leader guenther hartmann told west germanys bild newspaper 
noncommunist manfred gerlach took over as interim head of state 
after egon krenz resigned from the post this week 
krenz had taken over from honecker and although he introduced 
such reforms as opening east german borders he was forced to quit 
because of his longtime association with the disgraced honecker 
government 
on sunday after krenz and his politboro and central committee 
stepped down a 25member panel of party reformers was appointed to 
run party affairs until a party congress next week 
the rapid pace of changes and public anger at former leaders 
reportedly led citizens to storm secret police headquarters in four 
cities and stage politically motivated strikes at several state 
enterprises 
bild quoted dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer as saying there was 
a potential for violence on both sides i understand the 
motivation for the strikes but such a process can get out of 
control 
us military officials say some soviet forces in east germany 
have raised their level of readiness but apparently only to 
protect their bases and nuclear weapons according to a published 
report theyre worried about their own forces in the midst of 
this turmoil and rightfully so the washington post today quoted 
an unidentified senior us military official as saying 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev said he had no 
information on the report 
east german news media reported riots in some prisons by inmates 
demanding amnesty since last weekend inmates have been on hunger 
and work strikes at prisons in cottbus bautzen halle magdeburg 
and potsdam

surgery to remove part of a liver from a man who 
is donating it to his 15monthold daughter was going very 
smoothly today in the nations second such transplant a doctor 
said 
the operation on 20yearold robert jones began at about 730 
am at the university of chicago medical center and the transplant 
for his daughter sarina was expected to begin late in the 
afternoon said dr peter whitington the hospitals pediatric 
liver specialist 
a team led by dr christoph broelsch performed the first such 
procedure in the united states on nov 27 for a 21monthold girl 
from texas who continued doing well at the hospital today 
whitington said 
before the operation 11 days ago the transplant had been done 
only three times in brazil australia and japan according to the 
university one child died 
todays procedure involving jones a drywall installer and 
contractor from millington tenn near memphis and his daughter 
was expected to last as late as midnight whitington said 
no problems had arisen in the morning surgery he said broelsch 
was proceeding cautiously and taking his time 
its going very smoothly at the moment whitington said 
sarina was flown to chicago a week ago but the surgery was 
postponed because she was recovering from an infection 
she suffers from biliary atresia a usually fatal congenital 
disorder that blocks liver bile ducts and causes a backup of bile 
in the bloodstream and liver it is the leading cause for liver 
transplants involving children 
sarina is at a more advanced state of the disease than alyssa 
smith the texas girl who last month received a transplant from her 
mother teresa 29 
mrs smith a schoolteacher from schertz texas near san 
antonio left the hospital thursday with a big smile on her 
face hospital spokeswoman mary fetsch said 
she is staying at the ronald mcdonald house used by families 
who have children in the hospital sarinas mother michelle also 
is staying at the house 
the medical center hopes to perform 20 livingdonor liver 
transplants in the next 12 months partly in an effort to offset 
the shortage of donor organs 
onequarter to onehalf of the youngsters who need liver 
transplants are expected to die without them because too few 
organs are available from cadavers 
broelsch pioneered the technique of transplanting part of adult 
livers into youngsters whose abdominal cavities are too small to 
accommodate whole adult organs partial livers grow in size as the 
child grows and the living donors regenerate the liver tissue they 
have lost doctors say

former black panther party leaders who 
were reunited at the funeral of slain party cofounder huey p 
newton have formed a community group to help people affected by the 
oct 17 earthquake 
the program announced thursday by bobby seale david hilliard 
and onetime fugitive lawyer stephen bingham is similar to the 
black panthers 1960s program that sought improvements in housing 
jobs education and health care 
the former revolutionaries and community organizers charged the 
federal emergency management agency and the american red cross with 
doing more to assist white upperincome neighborhoods than to help 
blacks living in west oakland where the cypress section of 
interstate 880 collapsed in the quake 
they said they will work to overcome environmental racism 
which they defined as a system of subjecting blacks and poor people 
to health dangers and shabby living conditions near freeways and 
industries 
seale said he plans to return from philadelphia to his native 
oakland 
hilliard a longshoreman who lives in oakland said residents of 
west oakland see the red cross as a double cross they have 
turned a deaf ear to the cries of the people of west oakland 
both the red cross and fema have denied similar allegations 
repeatedly 
the new group which held a news conference to announce its 
formation said it would join several other community organizations 
in calling for free medical treatment for cypress area residents 
they will also call for rerouting the cypress section of i880 
away from the neighborhood and for immediate fema relief and 
lowcost housing for city residents left homeless by the quake

a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit 
brought against the us government by five campers injured when a 
hand grenade exploded in their campfire in the southern utah desert 
in a ruling released thursday us district judge david sam 
said the campers cannot sue the government for injuries because 
they intentionally threw the weapon in their campfire 
the campers found an m79 grenade while hiking near hurricane 
mesa in january 1986 the campsite was on bureau of land management 
property once privately leased as a munitions testing ground 
dennis simons brought the weapon back to camp and at least one 
person in the group recognized it as a projectile that hadnt been 
fired according to court documents 
the group placed the grenade by a tree and on the evening of 
jan 3 1986 david inscore threw it into their campfire the 
documents said 
the primer detonated while the campers hid behind their 
vehicles leading them to believe the grenade had exploded when 
they gathered around the fire the weapon exploded a second time 
this time more violently injuring all seven of the campers 
five of the seven sued to force the government to pay medical 
expenses for injuries resulting from the blast they were inscore 
simons penny snow william r hardman and henry zoetmulder 
simons 38 of salt lake city suffered two broken arms chest 
wounds and abdominal injuries and permanent disabilities hardman 
41 of salt lake city also was injured critically 
in his ruling sam argued that the plaintiffs knew the grenade 
was dangerous when they hid behind their vehicles after inscore 
threw it into the campfire 
clearly the act of mr inscore was an intentional detonation 
of the grenade said the judge to hold such an act a 
foreseeable consequence of the united states failure to remove the 
grenade from the desert simply defies logic

the easy purchase of the semiautomatic rifle 
used in the massacre of 14 women has renewed debate about whether 
tougher gun control laws are needed in canada where low crime has 
been a source of national pride 
much of the shock at wednesdays rampage at the university of 
montreal was simply based on the view that such things do not 
happen here 
its part of a cultural tradition in canada said gary 
mauser a firearms control specialist and professor at simon fraser 
university in vancouver british columbia canadians are much 
more lawabiding and more willing to believe that the law protects 
them the canadians trust their police more 
an extensive study of attitudes in canada and the united states 
published in july by macleans magazine found that 3 percent of 
canadians own handguns compared with 24 percent of americans 
marc lepine identified by police as the man who killed himself 
after wednesdays shooting purchased the weapon a 223caliber 
semiautomatic assault rifle at a hunting store nov 21 for 510 
all gun purchases in canada require a firearms acquisition 
certificate which costs 850 and is available to anyone 16 years 
or older who does not have a criminal record or a history of 
violent behavior 
the certificate is renewable every five years and there is no 
limit to the number of guns that may be purchased 
restricted weapons mostly handguns require an additional 
registration certificate automatic weapons are banned in canada 
in the united states the purchase of an automatic weapon 
requires a special federal license but regulations covering 
semiautomatics and other weapons are at the state and local level 
and vary widely 
all buyers of firearms however must sign a federal form 
attesting they have not been convicted of a felony judged mentally 
incompetent by a court or dishonorably discharged from the armed 
forces 
the canadian government has been planning changes in its gun 
control law that would eliminate the import of some semiautomatic 
weapons that can be easily converted to full automatic firing 
justice minister doug lewis said thursday in ottawa the proposed 
change would not affect weapons like the semiautomatic used 
wednesday because they are designed for hunting and are not easily 
converted to be fully automatic 
he said that despite the tragedy there are a great many 
canadians who appreciate the rules and laws we have weve got a 
pretty lawabiding country visavis firearms control 
lewis also said laws cannot guard against incidents like the 
rampage at the university of montreal you cant legislate 
against insanity he said 
canadians long have considered the lesser violence on their side 
of the border a keystone of national identity 
it was a major undertone to the fervent debate that preceded 
approval of the canadaus free trade agreement last year with 
opponents arguing that closer ties could bring in more aggressive 
ways 
my us colleagues are often incredulous when they learn how 
little experience their canadian counterparts have in treating 
gunshot wounds andrew pipe a health columnist in torontos 
globe and mail newspaper wrote recently 
the royal canadian mounted police reported 923125 restricted 
weapons in canada as of the end of last year most of them handguns 
in 1988 158972 certificates were issued 1192 applications 
refused and 10621 resulted in neither issuance nor refusal 
gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening gun 
control legislation 
but svend robinson an opposition new democrat legislator 
criticized lewis for delaying the proposed new legislation which 
has been in the works since summer 
how many more tragedies of this nature must we see in this 
country before this conservative government will finally act to 
keep the commitments they made he asked

a california architect on friday unveiled a scale 
model of paris new american center saying he hoped it would be 
a party in the park 
i wanted a building which would reflect the energy of the 
american center program said frank o gehry of santa monica 
calif its joyous and i wanted the building to have that 
feeling 
gehry born in toronto is one of the united states 
mostadmired architects a recent winner of the prestigious 
pritzker prize for architecture and almost always associated with 
fish designs 
the american center looks nothing like a fish it is a strong 
rectangular design with a pan coupe or as gehry put it a box 
with one side missing 
the design imposed by the shape of the park was a first for 
gehry it was torture and it took me three months to figure out 
what to do with it he said 
although building materials have not yet been chosen gehry said 
he envisioned a pinkishbeige limestone for the facades his dream 
he said is to have sliding glass entrance doors that could be left 
open during the summer 
that will be my california contribution he said id like 
people to be able to wander in from the park and peek around 
without being intimidated 
the main entrance is topped by a balletskirt shape zinc roof 
that fills the diagonal space between the other three sides of the 
building all of which are ringed with balconies 
groundbreaking for the 25 million center is expected to begin 
in june with completion scheduled for june 1992 
the american center is a nonprofit educational and cultural 
institution founded in 1931 to promote exchange between france and 
the united states 
in 1987 it sold its prestigious left bank quarters which had 
become too small to accommodate an evergrowing demand for its many 
cultural offerings including language and civilization lessons 
dance art photography computer and music workshops the new 
center will feature performing studios a permanent art museum and 
a 350seat auditorium 
the center will be built in bercy park in the southeastern 
corner of paris that until recently was a desolate stretch of 
train tracks and empty warehouses 
the ultramodern hightech finance ministry and the newly 
inaugurated operabastille just minutes from the new american 
center and the new bibliotheque de france across from it changed 
all that 
the new center is expected to handle 350000 visitors yearly

four children slain by snipers were among 
10 people killed in a second day of shiite moslem militia battles 
including a 7yearold shot when he switched on the light in his 
bedroom police said friday 
they said all the children were under age 8 and most of the 
other casualties including 20 people wounded were civilians hit 
by snipers or stray bullets in their homes 
hassan hamdan 7 was shot in the head when the light in his 
bedroom shone through the rain and revealed him to a sniper in 
mossaitbeh a lowincome residential district of moslem west beirut 
controlled by the mainstream shiite militia amal 
militiamen of amal which syria supports and the proiranian 
fundamentalist hezbollah began fighting at midday thursday they 
have battled sporadically since may 1987 in west beirut and south 
lebanon for supremacy among the 12 shiites lebanons largest 
sect 
syrian soldiers took up positions along a deserted boulevard on 
the milelong confrontation line friday a police spokesman whose 
name was withheld in keeping with regulations said the fighting 
abated but the militiamen remain in their positions 
soon after the syrians moved into the bourj abuhaidar district 
civilians emerged from bomb shelters to inspect their damaged 
apartments and gutted cars they scurried to safety again at the 
sound of sniper fire 
cables dangled from power poles and smoke billowed from the 
wreckage of cars hit by rocket propelled grenades 
militiamen battled in the rain all night and most of friday 
ignoring repeated ceasefire appeals from a security committee that 
includes representatives of lebanons main militias 
schools closed for the day in west beirut and the predominantly 
shiite southern slums reflecting fear the confrontation would 
spread to all moslem neighborhoods 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem urged both groups to 
put an immediate end to this destructive fighting and have mercy 
on the innocent civilians 
fighting began in west beirut two days after hezbollah crushed 
amals forces in the western sector of the syrianoccupied bekaa 
valley destroying its five major bases 
by police count 17 people were killed in that confrontation 
16 amal fighters and one from hezbollah and 42 were wounded 
police say 552 people were killed and 1532 wounded in previous 
amalhezbollah battles dating to may 1987

the infestation of mediterranean fruit 
flies in los angeles and orange counties is serious and could 
threaten californias agricultural economy according to a science 
panel 
in summary the panel agrees unanimously that this medfly 
problem is large very serious and will probably increase said 
roy cunningham a us department of agriculture research services 
official from hilo hawaii 
the panel thursday proposed expanding the aerial spraying of the 
pesticide malathion and said the need for spraying would likely 
continue through april and possibly longer 
isi siddiqui assistant director of the california department of 
food and agriculture endorsed the panels recommendation and said 
he expected it to be approved by the department today 
the medfly which can infest more than 250 kinds of fruit and 
vegetables has been under attack in los angeles county since 
summer siddiqui said spread of the medfly could cost the farm 
economy 200 million a year indefinitely 
rather than shrink the infestation has spread to part of orange 
county and now encompasses some 250 square miles the infestation 
is presently confined to urban areas but could threaten 
californias agricultural economy if it spread to farm country 
arizona authorities began stopping cars at the state line on 
thursday to prevent any fruit not certified as medflyfree from 
entering said state entomologist ivan shields 
trucks and commercial vehicles already were subject to 
inspection on entering arizona but car inspections had been halted 
in july to save about 250000 a year the state also has set fly 
traps 
the panel announced its recommendation at a news conference that 
also drew spraying opponents who contend malathion is poisoning 
people 
the accepted method of attacking an infestation has been to 
deliver a dose of malathion to the targeted area and then follow up 
with the release of millions of sterile medflies each week through 
two generations of the insects life cycle 
however the entire infested area would require 300 million to 
400 million flies and a government laboratory in hawaii can only 
reliably produce 100 million flies siddiqui said 
the panel recommended that malathion be sprayed in each area at 
least once every three weeks during the winters coldest periods 
when it takes flies longer to reach sexual maturity 
as weather warms into spring malathion should be applied every 
two weeks and then as frequently as every seven to 10 days weather 
conditions such as rain immediately after an application would 
require respraying 
during the news conference several protesters from a fledgling 
antimalathion movement challenged the panel 
who gave the department of agriculture the right to poison 
people said one woman 
siddiqui responded that the department has studied the health of 
people in previous spray areas and has found no ill effects from 
the tiny dose of malathion spread over each acre

alfred nobel made a fortune for 
inventing dynamite and earned world renown by bequeathing his 
wealth to establish the nobel prizes his brother ludvig nobel 
built an even larger fortune from oil in czarist russia 
but today the nobel family consists of mostly middleclass 
people living obscure lives in sweden finland the united states 
and canada 
its not quite richestorags but almost says carl nobel 
ludvigs grandson we are just an ordinary middleclass family 
it wasnt like that 101 years ago when alfred nobel came across 
his own obituary that condemned him as a warlord and profiteer from 
the means of death 
the death notice was published mistakenly when newspapers 
confused the nobel brothers at ludvigs death in 1888 but it 
prompted alfred to rewrite his will leaving all his assets to 
support the sciences and the search for peace 
nowadays a few nobel family members are invited each year to 
attend the nobel prize ceremonies dec 10 the anniversary of 
alfreds death in 1896 but none has any role in choosing the 
winners 
though the nobel name commands respect in swedish society 
because of the prestigious prizes the family is far reduced from 
the time when it was one of the wealthiest in europe 
soviet historians virtually erased ludvig nobel from the record 
after his oil empire was seized in the bolshevik revolution in 1917 
nobel industries a conglomerate that evolved from alfreds 
businesses is still a powerful force in the swedish economy the 
inventor who held 355 patents built more than 80 companies in 20 
nations 
but no nobel today is connected with any company named 
nobel said lorrie holmin a usborn writer who has studied the 
family 
the only nobel in public service is peter nobel who is swedens 
immigration ombudsman 
of ludvigs 18 children 10 survived infancy they spawned 19 
grandchildren 67 greatgrandchildren and at last count two years 
ago 123 greatgreatgrandchildren 
carl nobel is distinguished among them as owner of ludvigs 
101yearold portrait which covers an entire wall of his small 
apartment in saltsjobaden a seafront town south of stockholm 
alfred nobel a lifelong bachelor had two other brothers emil 
died at age 21 in an explosion while experimenting in alfreds 
laboratory 
the other brother robert is remembered as a black sheep 
partly because of his business failures and partly because he 
contested alfreds will he had three children 
as innovative as his famed brother ludvig designed the worlds 
first oil tanker installed europes first oil pipelines and 
invented the nobel wheel a wheelandaxle modification that 
could survive the bogs quagmires and potholes of 19thcentury 
russian roads according to stanford universitys robert w tolf in 
his 1976 book the russian rockefellers 
ludvig began by building diesel engines then produced munitions 
and rifles and later discovered oil near the caspian sea 
before world war i russia supplied half the worlds oil tolf 
wrote the nobel family produced onethird of all russias crude 
oil and 40 percent of its refined oil 
carl nobel a retired engineer estimates that 99 percent of the 
familys immense wealth was confiscated by the bolsheviks after the 
1917 revolution 
a few subsidiary companies in france and finland and part of the 
tanker fleet were salvaged and financed a new diesel engine factory 
in sweden 
nobel brothers which once rivaled the rothschilds oil 
companies in europe finally was dissolved in 1959 after 80 years 
in business 
the nobel clan still meets every three years carl nobel said 
its current chairman is sven nobel oleinikoff 81 a swiss resident 
but in the last decades the meeting has become just a family 
reunion there is no business left to discuss said carl

the government incorrectly cut off cash 
benefits to some of the most vulnerable of americas poor the 
elderly blind and disabled in more than half the cases reviewed 
in a study the social security administration said friday 
the findings suggest more than 10000 recipients of supplemental 
security income may have their benefits suspended each year 
despite being unable to act or unlikely to understand what they 
must do to continue receiving benefits an agency report said it 
said about 25 percent of those affected are mentally impaired to 
some degree 
clearly the agency needs to guard against this lapse in 
public service it said 
ssi provides a minimum income floor to 45 million lowincome 
aged blind and disabled people maximum monthly benefits are 368 
for an individual and 553 for a couple this year rising to 386 
and 579 respectively in 1990 
social securitys study found that the number of ssi 
beneficiaries whose benefits were suspended for failure to 
cooperate with the agencys efforts to monitor eligibility rose 
from 80000 in 1987 to 105000 in 1988 
an internal review of 1293 suspension cases found that benefits 
were incorrectly cut off in 54 percent of the cases and that the 
suspensions were justified but incorrecly recorded in an additional 
30 percent of the cases 
most of the incorrect suspensions occurred because social 
security employees were not giving recipients adequate time and 
assistance to provide financial and other information required to 
demonstrate eligiblity the report said 
social security spokesman phil gambino said the agency was 
extremely concerned about the findings because they do show 
were suspending ssi payments which go to some of the most 
vulnerable people the elderly and disabled 
this can cause very serious problems for these people who are 
living on very limited incomes gambino said 
in response to the report the social security administration in 
late november issued a directive to field offices cautioning that 
workers must be careful to make sure that ssi benefits are not 
improperly suspended for failure to provide information 
failure to follow these instructions can result in serious 
problems for the individuals served by the ssi program the memo 
said 
employees were reminded that recipients must be given 30 days to 
respond to requests for information about their financial status 
and that an extension may be granted to those who have difficultly 
providing requested information 
in addition the memo said recipients who have difficulty 
complying with the requests because of advanced age disability or 
homelessness should receive a followup contact by telephone or in 
person before benefits are suspended 
sen david pryor an arkansas democrat who chairs the senate 
special committee on aging said the study indicated many of those 
whose benefits were cut off were too frail to be able to comply 
with ssas requests without the help of a field worker help which 
never arrived 
when an ssi recipient is cut off it can lead to homelessness 
starvation or exploitation pryor said 
the study cited heavy workloads at the social security 
administration and the desire to prevent overpayments as factors in 
the incorrect suspensions 
social securitys workforce has been slashed by 20 percent to 
65000 over the past six years as part of a campaign to modernize 
and streamline operations workers have complained they are 
overworked and unable to provide high quality service 
ssi benefits that have been suspended are reinstated if the 
recipient presents the information needed to demonstrate 
eligibility in the study group 67 percent of beneficiaries had 
been reinstated within six months of being suspended

some soviet military forces in east germany 
have raised their alert status but it apparently is just to 
protect their bases and nuclear weapons a pentagon official said 
today 
its a selfprotection measure said the official who spoke 
on condition he not be identified by name 
the official said the pentagon does not view the soviet move as 
a prelude to intervention in the political turmoil of east germany 
they have taken increased security measures but it is similar 
to something we might do at our bases if there are problems nearby 
they havent moved their troops forward and they arent 
preparing for battle the official said 
the development was first reported in todays editions of the 
washington post 
we think this is probably a benign development the post 
quoted a senior us military official as saying theyre worried 
about their own forces in the midst of this turmoil and 
rightfully so 
the official said the soviets are basically going into a 
bastion mode 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the post in an 
interview that the soviet union has pledged to the united states 
since last summer that it will not intervene militarily to block 
the fastpaced changes in eastern europe 
they have been very very firm with us baker said he said 
the soviets told the united states they would not use force in 
eastern europe to do so would mean that perestroika has failed 
baker said the first assurances were conveyed by soviet foreign 
minister eduoard shevardnadze in a meeting in paris last july 29 
before the entry of solidarity into the government of poland and 
the massive flight from east germany 
the soviets have used troops to suppress change in the region 
before notably in east berlin in 1953 hungary in 1956 and with 
their warsaw pact allies in czechoslovakia in 1968 
there were reports last august that romanian authorities had 
requested warsaw pact intervention in poland and leaders of the 
new movements in eastern europe have sought assurances the warsaw 
pact would not be used against them 
rep ike skelton dmo a member of the house armed services 
committee said today that the reported increase in the readiness 
of soviet forces is a prime example of instability creating 
tensions and tension causing a higher state of military alert 
skelton stressed that the united states should maintain its 
troop levels overseas and cautioned against any rash steps until 
the turmoil and instability settles 
we just dont know what type of scenario will come to past 
he said in a telephone interview 
in the interview baker read from a cable received thursday from 
the us ambassador to east germany richard c barkley reporting 
the government still runs the people work and the economy 
produces 
barkleys remarks were in line with the departments comments 
thursday that it does not fear disorder in east germany 
i think what is taking place for example in east germany 
daily life goes on shops are open things like that said a 
department spokesman richard boucher we have always held that 
change should be peaceful should be orderly were not trying to 
create instability 
boucher announced that baker would meet with west german and 
british officials during a trip to europe starting sunday to 
discuss issues of mutual concern 
boucher said he hoped that the next government of czechoslovakia 
would be more broadly based than that headed by ladislav adamec 
before he resigned as premier on thursday 
any new government that is formed in czechoslovakia must 
reflect the need for broad representation not only among factions 
of the communist party but in society as a whole he said 
he was asked whether the state department regarded developments 
in eastern europe as unstable 
i wouldnt describe it that way boucher said there are 
dramatic events and important events happening almost every day 
and sometimes were surprised we welcome them but at this point 
i dont think were talking about instability

coastal flooding should be less severe than 
expected during the next century because sea level will rise only 
about 14 inches instead of 39 inches if earths atmosphere gets 
warmer scientists say 
we have destruction along our coasts now even with modestly 
rising sea level there are going to be more and more problems but 
they wont be as bad as we thought a few years ago said 
glaciologist mark meier director of the institute of arctic and 
alpine research at the university of colorado boulder 
the revised and stilluncertain estimate of sealevel changes 
was issued thursday during the american geophysical unions fall 
meeting by scientists who conducted nine studies on how 
pollutioncaused global warming will affect the oceans glaciers 
and ice sheets 
glaciologist charles bentley of the university of wisconsin at 
madison said his study found the sea level wont rise as much as 
expected largely because the the south polar ice sheet will get 
bigger instead of melting as commonly believed 
that is because a warmer atmosphere carries more moisture and 
will dump more snow on antarctica the polar ice cap contains about 
70 percent of earths water 
a 1985 national academy of sciences report concluded global 
warming would cause about a 39inch rise in sea level by about the 
year 2050 enough to allow storm surges to devastate lowlying 
areas along the us gulf coast florida bangladesh and the 
maldives meier said 
but the studies led to a new consensus that the sealevel rise 
will total about 14 inches although a great deal of uncertainty 
remains that means the sea level could do anything from dropping 2 
inches to rising as much as 30 inches 
meier and others emphasized their new forecast which assumes a 
doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 2050 may not hold 
true past that year and that rising sea levels could become more 
severe after that 
every 12inch rise in sea level means lowlying shorelines 
retreat inland by 100 feet meier said 
modest sea level increases also may destroy wetlands and let 
saltwater ruin fresh water aquifers and kill plants and animals in 
coastal estuaries

thousands of christmas shoppers at a mall will 
get a chance next week to paint murals sending a message of love to 
hospital patients in the soviet union and elsewhere around the 
world 
artist john feight who has designed thousands of murals for 
hospitals over the last 15 years said friday that he expects 4000 
people 1 percent of the shoppers expected at the lenox square 
mall next week to stop and color in a section of the 116 murals 
he has designed for the project 
sixteen of the murals identical pictures of the word love 
in russian and english joined by a heart will end up in hospitals 
in the soviet union the 49yearold founder of the foundation for 
hospital art said 
the rest various pictures of butterflies flowers and jungle 
scenes are destined for display in hospitals in bangladesh 
italy portugal austria zaire liberia and kenya as well as 
georgia baptist hospital in atlanta lake charles memorial hospital 
in louisiana and feights place of birth joel pomerene memorial 
hospital in millersburg ohio 
at the mall next week feight and volunteers will ask passersby 
to take a few minutes to help fill in the colors on the 4by6 foot 
loose canvas murals 
sometimes its not easy to get nonartists to take brush to 
hand he said 
theyre so innocent he said i go up to someone and say 
will you hold this please its a cup of paint and then i say 
now that you have this in your hand why dont you paint this 
space and they protest i cant paint i cant draw a straight 
line i havent taken any lessons 
but once they get into the idea that were helping people in 
hospitals they get into it they dont care its more than art 
its love 
the canvasses featuring love in english and russian were 
inspired by feights visit in april 1988 to the moscow research 
institute of eye microsurgery the patients there and staffers from 
the us embassy helped feight paint 37 murals on the walls of the 
hospital 
i did one mural that had the word love in russian feight 
recalled he said that prompted the hospitals director dr 
svyatoslav n fyodorov to remark thats what we need more of 
around here love 
that comment led to his latest project feight said 
he said he plans to take the 16 murals to moscow personally in 
early april from there fyodorov will distribute the murals to 
various hospitals in the soviet union 
while in moscow feight said he will direct the painting of 
similar murals by moscow residents those murals will be displayed 
at lenox square in april before going to various us hospitals

cory returned friday and spoke to 
the people in their own language with the simple directness that 
charmed the nation in 1986 and ultimately drove a dictator into 
exile 
at a rally of more than 100000 people corazon aquino wagged 
her finger and said of vice president salvador laurel who has 
become her political rival hes just too much he keeps on 
saying cory resign cory resign what does he think i am 
stupid that i would resign just like that so he can be president 
the crowd chantedcory cory cory 
it was much like february 1986 when mrs aquino the 
presidential candidate who described herself as just a 
housewife was swept into office by an outpouring of people 
power 
mrs aquino appears to have emerged from the ruins of a 
weeklong coup attempt with a new boldness determined to confront 
her foes and circumvent the advisers who have shielded her from the 
people 
she lambasted laurel and sen juan ponce enrile whom she fired 
as defense minister in november 1986 after his followers attempted 
a coup she spoke extemporaneously in the accent and tagalog 
language of uneducated filipinos not the polished english of most 
public addresses 
when she told senate president jovito salonga she wanted enrile 
investigated by the senate committee examining the latest coup 
mrs aquino told the crowd salonga replied that he had put enrile 
on the committee 
that she declared caused her to pound her fist on the table 
and say are we fooling each other or what he should be the one 
investigated and not the investigator 
enrile agreed to remove himself from the committee she said to 
howls of approval she added the postscript its good that he 
still has a little shame left 
in praising loyal military officers she mentioned brig gen 
arturo enrile who negotiated the surrender of rebels thursday in 
manila and observed thank god he is not related to sen 
enrile 
of laurel she said using his nickname before coming here i 
said to myself should i even bother to mention that doy laurel or 
should i just flick him away like a fly 
after the remarks about his desire to replace her mrs aquino 
said laurel receives 24 million pesos 11 million in office 
allowances as vice president 
ive been thinking if doy laurel really loves our country as 
he says he does maybe its about time he resigned so we can use 
that 24 million pesos she told the crowd since we know that 
he cannot wait to be president i will never give up this position 
to him 
mrs aquinos style was the same one she used in 1986 to defeat 
ferdinand e marcos who had ruled the archipelago for 20 years 
the crowd approved 
her remarks may be unpresidential but the fight has really 
become personal said a businessman who asked that his name not 
be used 
celia yutuc an optometrist said thats what we wanted to 
hear were happy

a grand jury will investigate whether officials 
mishandled a case involving alleged sexual relations between a high 
school teacher and a student the attorney general said 
attorney general doug baily said he hoped the grand jury would 
sort through the evidence and accusations then issue a public 
report 
the grand jury is seen as a way of defusing a lawsuit filed by 
the school board against police and prosecutors for a series of 
raids on school buildings the district maintains investigators 
exceeded the scope of their search warrants and invaded the privacy 
of students teachers and administrators 
baily said thursday he wants the grand jury to clarify the duty 
of school officials in reporting sexual abuse in addition he 
said he wants the grand jury to consider evidence of official 
misconduct by law enforcement or school officials and weigh if 
any charges are to be filed im not expecting that at this point 
baily named pat doogan chief assistant district attorney in 
fairbanks to lead the grand jury baily said he expects the 
superior court to grant his request for a grand jury 
school board president william frick said he was glad to hear of 
the grand jury but not convinced doogan would be independent 
enough 
they are all members of the state prosecutors office he may 
be asked to pass judgment on a fellow prosecutor frick said 
the case involves the alleged relationship between gordon 
satch carlson and a 17yearold girl 
carlson taught english for 17 years until he resigned from 
bartlett high school in august the 44yearold carlson pleaded 
innocent to charges of sexually abusing a minor in his care 
the age of sexual consent in alaska is 16 but prosecutors 
insist the age is 18 in situations where the adult is in a trust 
relationship with the minor

president bush today predicted a new kind of 
peace between the soviet union and united states again striking 
a positive tone in the wake of skeptical comments by aides and 
advisers 
in a spech at a political luncheon here bush did not repeat his 
more negative comments of the night before in houston when he said 
that soviet activities with cuba and nicaraga weigh heavily on 
ussoviet relations 
our mission to malta was about peace the president said of 
his summit last weekend with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
not the kind of uneasy peace weve known for the last 40 years 
hard and cold but about the new kind of peace we aspire to one 
that is rich with the promise of permanence 
yes there were differences at malta he said we can 
express them in an agreeable and forceful way without being 
disagreeable 
at todays fundraiser for rep hank brown a colorado 
republican running for the senate bush said he envisions the 
coming decade filled with optimism hope and a sense of new 
beginnings 
he heralded new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what 
used to be called the iron curtain 
his statements came following remarks by aides voicing 
skepticism about gorbachevs ability to succeed with his reforms 
one senior official had characterized gorbachevs economic views 
as simplistic white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
while disavowing that term said it would be difficult to integrate 
freemarket systems into the soviet union because the soviets do 
not have experience or knowledge about such sophisticated economic 
matters 
earlier in the week vice president dan quayle threw a wet 
blanket on the postsummit rosiness by saying the soviet union was 
still a totalitarian state and that gorbachev had yet to prove he 
was scaling back on international adventurism 
but bush today seemed anxious to again stress his hopes for a 
new americansoviet relationship we took our first step toward the 
next decade and the new world that is taking shape a new world of 
security and freedom 
he also issued a written statement noting the massive earthquake 
that devastated soviet armenia a year ago thursday 
recalling the assistance provided by us government and private 
groups and the soviet offer of help after this years san 
franciscoarea earthquake the president said as we look to a 
new era in ussoviet relations we can take hope from these 
examples of humanitarian cooperation between our two countries

union for its relations with cuba and nicaragua 
whatever the sandinistas have told the soviet union we know 
for fact certain that arms are going from nicaragua into el

moscow no longer arms nicaraguas leftist sandinista government or 
the marxist rebels in el salvador 
earlier thursday he visited winzer park in a oncedrug infested 
part of houston 
he said americans should assume the task of ridding their 
communities of drugs because it is not a federal problem for 
which there is a simple federal solution we cant do it by looking 
to the government alone 
only the american people can make this change in attitude 
only you can cultivate character and a sense of values in our kids

britain is regarded in the united states and 
canada as an offshore banking system because drug traffickers 
have laundered at least 19 billion in the country a 
parliamentary committee says 
the house of commons home affairs committee said in a report 
published thursday that this amount could pose a significant 
threat to the wellbeing of britains financial institutions 
home office minister david mellor told the commons on friday 
that international drug traffickers are trying harder than ever to 
bring drugs into the country 
the committee said the drug laundering could have a particularly 
destabilizing effect on smaller financial institutions whose 
deposits were cut by successful detection and confiscation of drug 
profits 
the report said urgent reforms were needed to increase the 
effectiveness of the 1986 drug trafficking offenses act which was 
introduced to combat international drug trafficking through the 
seizure and confiscation of the proceeds 
between january 1987 and may 1989 it said police and customs 
officials had obtained confiscation orders for only 17 million 
barry price head of the national drugs intelligence unit at 
scotland yard said in the report that his department was handling 
a case where 74 million from drug trafficking had passed to or 
through britain 
traffickers wanted to invest in politically and financially 
stable countries he said 
it is a natural consequence of having that sort of environment 
within our business world that people are going to deposit money 
there price said 
the committee urged the bank of england to examine the scale of 
the threat to the financial community posed by money laundering 
which disguises the proceeds of criminal activity 
mellor said that between jan 1 and dec 5 680 pounds of heroin 
was seized by customs compared with 464 pounds for all of 1988 
during the same period the amount of cocaine impounded was 862 
pounds compared with 581 pounds last year he said

moscows views on german reunification 
cannot be ignored but it would be hard to say no to a decision 
made freely by the east german people said vernon walters us 
ambassador to bonn 
in an interview thursday the veteran of cold war diplomacy also 
showed delight about his frontrow seat as the iron curtains 
battered remains come tumbling down 
i think im so lucky i cant even believe it most of my 
contemporaries are driving golf carts around florida joked 
walters 72 
walters reached into a drawer of his enormous desk and pulled 
out a large chunk of the berlin wall 
i got myself a good hunk of it he beamed proudly holding 
his personal remnant of the concrete barrier that once symbolized 
europes impenetrable divisions 
being in the middle of the action as europes divisions crumble 
has a special meaning for walters who has made a career out of 
nudging it along 
the retired army general held crucial nato posts in the 
alliances early years was us military attache in paris and 
rome served as interpreter and foreignrelations troubleshooter 
for several presidents occupied the no 2 post at the cia and has 
served as us ambassadoratlarge and ambassador to the united 
nations 
he has rubbed elbows with every imprtant figure from the cold 
war era from dwight eisenhower to nikita s khrushchev from 
charles de gaulle to marshal tito from john f kennedy to fidel 
castro 
and now the barriers walters saw going up after world war ii 
are being knocked down by the seemingly unstoppable democratic 
euphoria sweeping eastern europe 
the winds of freedom are blowing and theyre blowing from the 
west and anyone communist officials who doesnt understand this 
is going to be gone with the wind walters said 
he was among the first us officials to say german 
reunification could very well occur because of the democratic 
fervor toppling communist governments across eastern europe 
he said that however changes unfold in eastern europe moscows 
interests cannot be ignored 
stability is the key to the ability of the process to go on 
walters said and i think things have to proceed in such a way 
that they the soviets dont feel humiliated 
walters said if after free elections the east germans decide to 
pursue a certain path it will be very hard for people to say 
no 
but he pointed out recent assertions by president bush that if 
unification occurs it must come through free choice and peacefully 
peacefully means with the agreement of the soviets walters 
said after all they have 17 divisions in east germany and you 
cant do it without their agreement 
the kremlin recently softened its hard opposition to even 
discussing the possibility of german reunification and walters 
says one cant exclude the possibility of moscow eventually 
supporting the idea 
i think they the soviets may come to see it as being in 
their own interest at some point said walters especially if 
we are successful in talks on reduction of conventional forces 
the soviets have been worried that german reunification could 
result in a major change in europes military balance 
walters also said if there were reunification he believes the 
german people would opt to stay with nato rather than become 
neutral 
he also said he believes nato will continue to be an 
indispensible element for security in europe 
whatever happens there is still going to be a large powerful 
russian state on the eastern boundaries of the european community 
and i think very few people want us to go away and leave them 
said walters 
walters has been ambassador in bonn since earlier this year and 
has been busy monitoring the historic events and keeping washington 
informed 
ive met the soviet ambassador here and i met with the soviet 
ambassador in east berlin and i have the nato ambassadors to 
dinner from time to time said walters 
walters was in berlin just after the wall opened and witnessed 
the euphoria as east germans streamed into the west for the first 
time in their lives 
i made sure i was there walters said 
walters said he had foreseen great changes occurring knowing 
that mikhail s gorbachevs reforms would eventually take root in 
eastern europe 
but ill be honest with you the speed of the events is faster 
than i had anticipated 
walters said he hopes eastern europeans getting their first 
taste of freedom dont become impatient and expect events to occur 
faster than possible 
we think its moving at colossal speed but a lot seem to 
think its moving too slowly and that some of the changes arent 
deep enough he said 
but i think most have enough good sense to see the long shadow 
of freedom is falling across them and the sun hasnt been out in 
40 years

tests scheduled saturday to gain entry 
to us universities were canceled following reports of widespread 
cheating when the last exams were given in october an education 
administrator said 
someone somewhere is doing nasty and dirty things sushil k 
liddle director of the institute for psychological and educational 
measurement said thursday 
liddle refused to give details but a wellplaced source said 
copies of the october exam were sold in advance for 300 apiece to 
hundreds perhaps thousands of indian students who took the test 
the institute in allahabad about 360 miles southeast of new 
delhi administers the graduate record examinations on behalf of 
educational testing service of princeton nj the test is taken 
primarily by college students to enter graduate school 
another source who works at the allahabad institute said he 
was told some packets containing blank october test papers had been 
opened before they arrived at testing centers in several indian 
cities the staffer like the first source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the test papers are mailed directly from princeton to testing 
centers in india the staffer said he said the packets were opened 
after they arrived at airports and before they reached testing 
centers 
liddle contacted by telephone from new delhi said examinations 
scheduled saturday at 30 testing centers were postponed until 
january 
it is a very very serious matter and we are very concerned 
said liddle who has been director of the allahabad institute since 
it was founded in 1979 
an estimated 3500 to 4000 students were to take the test this 
month 
the princeton testing service invalidated the tests of 
twothirds of the indian students who took the october exam the 
invalidations affected 2744 people who took the tests at 17 of 
indias 30 test centers 
the allahabad sources said the fraud was discovered when 
students at some centers scored far higher than those at other 
centers 
that was just a doubt but soon we heard reports that the 
question papers were known beforehand at the centers where students 
did extremely well one of the sources said 
testing service spokesman ray nicosia said it was not known how 
many students bought tests or from whom 
cheating is common during exams in india newspapers routinely 
publish notices from universities to inform students their final 
exams have been disqualified because of cheating 
one of the allahabad sources said the institute for 
psychological and educational measurement learned of the october 
fraud after receiving anonymous letters mailed in the south indian 
city of hyderabad the letters claimed some people had offered to 
sell the test papers to students before they reported for the exam 
the source said 
some of the test takers also wrote to princeton complaining 
exams were being sold said nicosia 
liddle said two types of tests were administered in india for 
students seeking admission to american graduate schools 
students must pay 50 for the general test if a second test in 
a specific subject is required the fee for both tests is 85 
liddle said students whose tests were invalidated could get a 
refund or take the test again free of charge 
there have been reports of cheating in other tests 
the administration of the test of english as a foreign language 
examination was canceled at five centers in the south indian city 
of bangalore on oct 28 because of alleged fraud

a federal judge delayed charles h keating 
jrs scheduled court appearance today to hear testimony about a 
land swap regulators claim was used to siphon funds from keatings 
savings and loan association 
a phoenix investor phillip gordon who also is vice chairman of 
the phoenix planning commission testified that he sold a 135acre 
parcel to lincoln savings and loan associations holding company 
last jan 28 for a price 15 million above its appraised value 
the next day gordon said he used the 15 million to make a 25 
percent down payment on the purchase of 445 acres of desert land 
west of phoenix that was owned by a land development subsidiary of 
lincoln 
lincolns chief government regulator had testified wednesday 
that the pair of transactions enabled lincoln to record a phony 
44 million profit on its sale of the desert land 
in turn lincolns parent company siphoned off 18 million from 
the thrifts coffers in the form of a future tax liablity on the 
phony profits the regulator told us district court judge stanley 
sporkin 
sporkin is holding hearings on government motions to dismiss a 
suit keating filed last may against federal regulators in the 
suit keating is asking the court to undo a decision by the 
regulators last april to seize control of lincoln as the worst of 
more than 560 thrift failures since mid 1987 
the government expects the thrift failures to cost taxpayers 
more than 160 billion in covering the losses of federallyinsured 
deposits to a combination of poor investments insider deals fraud 
and lax regulation the cost to taxpayers of lincolns losses alone 
is put at 25 billion 
keating had been scheduled to appear today but sporkin on 
thursday told attorneys for keating and the government that he 
wanted to hear testimony today only from the regulator who 
recommended the seizure of lincoln last april and three phoenix 
businessmen 
the regulator kevin oconnell deputy director of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision testified thursday that 
lincolns owner used sham transactions with the three 
businessmen to siphon off millions of dollars in deposits 
oconnell faced crossexamination today by lincolns attorney in 
the suit charles stern 
keating who contributed 13 million to the political causes of 
five senators in a campaign to thwart regulators was the last of 
eight witnesses the government has scheduled in seeking dismissal 
of his suit 
keating and his attorneys allege lincoln was being operated 
soundly and that the governments takeover of the irvine calif 
thrift was capricious and arbitrary 
the target of a criminal investigation by a federal grand jury 
in los angeles keating has refused once to testify in response to 
a subpoena last month he invoked fifth amendment protection 
against selfincrimination before the house banking committee 
asked if keating would again claim a constitutional right not to 
testify in the court case in his suit his personal attorney john 
quinn said thursday im not at liberty to discuss that 
oconnell testified that lincoln and its parent company 
american continental corp of phoenix claimed 155 million in 
phony profits from two bogus land transactions to justify 58 
million in tax collections from lincoln that were never paid the 
government 
those two deals involving some 1500 acres of desert land 
outside phoenix plus a stock transaction and the tax arrangement 
are literally just the tip of the iceberg james p murphy an 
attorney for the government told sporkin 
oconnell testified american continental of which keating is 
chairman collected 948 million in deferred taxes from the thrift 
from 1984 through 1988 much of it on phony profits from real 
estate deals 
lincolns attorneys say the taxsharing arrangement under which 
american continental bundled the taxes owed by both it lincoln were 
approved by federal regulators in san francisco 
oconnell however said lincoln had misrepresented its 
nature to the san francisco officials federal regulations he 
said allow a holding company only to act as a collector of current 
taxes owed by a thrift subsidiary not deferred taxes 
he said keatings taxsharing arrangement amounted to an 
interestfree loan from lincoln to its holding company which is 
prohibited by federal law 
asked how much of the 948 million went to pay taxes oconnell 
said our best estimate is zero 
the regulator said that four months before lincoln was seized 
the government ordered american continental to repay lincoln 60 
million of the tax payments it had collected from the thrift 
but american continental declared bankruptcy last april 13 one 
day before the government seized lincoln and before any of the 
money was refunded said oconnell 
meanwhile thrift regulators said thursday that 16 sampls were 
permitted to sell 3 billion in uninsured debt to their retail 
customers the same practice that cost many depositors at lincoln 
their life savings 
some 22000 investors many of them elderly pensioners and 
widows lost an estimated 250 million by purchasing subordinated 
debt in american continental in 1987 and 1988 despite that the 
same practice was permitted at other sampls including seven which 
received permission for sales this year

that is until a grinch chopped it down and made off with the 
12foot monterey pine that had become a neighborhood landmark 
on wednesday ricardo hernandez walked out the front door and 
saw only a stump with pine needles scattered about the 36yearold 
welder took to the trail of needles like a hunter takes to 
footprints in the snow 
the path eventually led to an apartment complex where hernandez 
found his tree sitting on a porch 
but the grinch didnt live there 
it was some old man with six kids hernandez said thursday

couldnt steal the christmas spirit i tried to tell them that they 
can steal a tree but not the spirit

public approval of sen alan cranston has 
plummeted since he and four other us senators have come under 
fire for intervening on behalf of collapsed lincoln savings 
according to a poll published friday 
the los angeles times poll showed that cranstons approval 
rating has undergone a turnabout since an october poll in which 56 
percent of the respondents had a favorable view of him and 32 
percent saw him unfavorably 
the latest poll found 58 percent had an unfavorable impression 
of cranston as opposed to 32 percent favorable an overwhelming 79 
percent said it was time to give someone else a chance to run for 
californias senatorial seat 
for the fiveday telephone survey ending dec 6 calls were made 
to 2046 people 1594 of whom were registered voters the polls 
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points 
fortyone percent of those answering the poll said cranston 
should step down as opposed to 37 percent who believe cranston 
should remain as majority whip of the us senate 
only 14 percent of those surveyed said cranston has performed 
his duties well enough to be reelected 
cranston has come under fire for accepting 850000 in donations 
from charles h keating jr owner of the defunct irvinebased 
thrift and then apparently bargaining with federal regulators on 
behalf of lincoln savings the donations went to three voter 
registration groups cranston supported 
a majority of those polled 79 percent said cranston acted 
improperly in the lincoln controversy only 8 percent said he acted 
properly 
investigators believe keating may have used contributions to 
gain favor among powerful politicians to protect lincoln savings 
the taxpayer bailout of lincoln savings is expected to cost up to 
2 billion the most expensive thrift failure in history

czechoslovakia has suggested selling off some of 
its museum collections for hard currency an auction house official 
said friday 
at czechoslovakias invitation three officials from christies 
auction house visited museums and galleries in prague and 
bratislava in september to discuss possibly selling mainly 
unwanted nonczechoslovak items said legal adviser david allison 
we were taken around nothing was offered allison said in 
an interview we only know that they tell us they have a lot of 
stuff in their basements 
allison said the proposed sale hasnt been dropped weve 
left it to them to come back to us 
but because of the political turmoil in czechoslovakia it 
wont be a very high priority it will be some time before the 
project is reviewed if it ever is 
allison said the state jewish museum of prague was included in 
their itinerary prompting criticism from jewish groups he 
insisted christies would not be interested in auctioning 
anything that has a doubtful title or that would raise a protest 
from any section of the public 
the los angelesbased simon wiesenthal center said friday that 
the jewish museums collection should remain intact and 
transferred to israel as part of the normalization of relations 
hoped for as a result of current developments within czechoslovakia 
and eastern europe 
if the collection is sold then monies raised clearly belong 
to the jewish community in czechoslovakia said shimon samuels 
the wiesenthal centers european director 
allison said the czechoslovak parliament had suggested in the 
fall that state museums wishing to sell off unwanted items would 
be allowed to do so 
most museums have things in their basement and all are 
desperately in need of money with which to buy other items or as 
in the case of czechoslovakia to buy small things like 
humidifiers he said they are very much starved of funds 
the czechoslovak government felt one way around this would be 
to sell off some items through christies and be paid through 
hard currency allison said 
but the state agency art centrum responsible for museums and 
galleries made it clear that items with czechoslovak 
dimensions would not be offered for sale to avert protests from 
the countrys heritage lobby 
prague has much european art that escaped destruction in both 
world wars once a cosmopolitan center it became very rich in 
works of art from all over europe allison said 
he visited the national gallery the museum of technology and 
the city of prague museum as well as the main gallery in 
bratislava where he said officials told him that only 05 
percent of the works of art theyve got is on display and the rest 
is in store and in not very good condition 
things theyve got are literally rotting away in damp store 
rooms he said

the mother of a high school student is 
angry over a school policy in which cafeteria workers are told not 
to feed students whose parents have outstandings bills for food 
joan bowe of campbells creek said she learned of the policy when 
her daughter came home hungry one day last month 
that meant our children were in school all day long hungry and 
none of us parents were made aware of it bowe said 
bowes daughter and a friend had slipped out of the lunch line 
after witnessing other students with outstanding bills being denied 
lunch 
she knew shed be embarrassed because i hadnt sent the lunch 
bill it was just an oversight of mine bowe said 
unpaid bills for cafeteria meals totaled about 12000 at dupont 
high school alone said principal jimmie compton the debts led him 
to crack down this year on students eating on credit parents owed 
the school about 5000 as of two weeks ago when compton began 
denying lunch to students whose lunch payments were delinquent 
i cant operate a cafeteria with a deficit like that he 
said i cant pay the bills 
a computerized payment system was enacted at dupont and other 
area schools last year so students who received free or reduced 
lunches could not be distinguished from other students 
each student has a number which a cashier punches into a 
machine parents receive bills monthly 
the system has worked well in most areas although schools in 
the eastern part of the county such as dupont have a higher rate 
of nonpayment said schools spokesman mike bell 
compton said the school informed parents who owed money that 
their children would be unable to charge meals at the cafeteria if 
outstndings debts were unpaid by the 15th of each month

arlen specter realized the possible political implications of his 
friday gettogether with comedian jackie mason 
jackies speaking for himself ill deny everything jackie 
says joked specter rpa shortly after shaking hands with 
mason before their luncheon date at elaines on the upper east side 
of manhattan 
mason of course created problems for gop mayoral hopeful 
rudolph giuliani earlier this year with his remarks about jewish 
voting habits and a perceived slur against blacks while jackie was 
apologetic about the remarks at the time he was back to his 
boisterous self on friday 
nobody claims i cost giuliani votes it was a fiction a bum 
rap by a couple of people at a couple of papers when i joined 
giuliani was down 20 percent he lost by 2 percent mason said 
with a shrug 
its the same jokes i told on broadway for two years i got a 
tony award for those jokes said mason 
specter didnt appear fazed by his masons political past the 
pair wound up posing for dozens of pictures together with an 
assortment of celebrities at the event which was not a fundraiser 
specter who lives in the land of the cheese steak even laughed 
at masons borscht belt wisecracks 
all my life i heard there was no such thing as a free lunch 
but whenever i see a senator eating hes eating for free said 
mason 
specter said he and mason had met last year in washington for 
lunch i still have the receipt in my pocket the senator 
cracked and they have stayed in touch since then mason said the 
friday lunch was aimed at creating a higher profile for specter 
who runs again in 1992 
the truth of the matter is i love the guy said mason i 
want to give him all the support i can and get him reelected

president bush shared the head table at a 
republican fundraiser friday in denver with larry mizel a 
colorado developer whose company is one of several at the center of 
federal investigations into the savings and loan industry 
larry mizel owner of mdc holdings inc was chairman of a 
luncheon for rep hank brown a republican a hoping to succeed sen 
william armstrong rcolo bushs speech was the main attraction at 
the 250to1000aplate event expected to raise between 
500000 and 1 million 
the president before launching into his talk referred to many 
of the guests at the head table but did not mention mizel a 
prominent republican who raised 1 million for ronald reagans 1984 
campaign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president had no 
say in mizels involvement adding hes involved here through 
the brown campaign we just have no control over it 
mizels company along with lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif and silverado banking savings and 
loan association of denver are the focus of an investigation by 
thrift regulators according to m danny wall director of the 
office of thrift supervision 
the office is looking at series transactions in which mdc 
lincoln silverado and san jacinto savings association bellaire 
texas swapped junk bonds and loans among themselves wall said 
such daisy chains have been used by sampls to hide questionable 
credits from regulators 
according to a september 1988 letter released by the house 
banking committee sampl regulators in dallas were concerned with the 
apparent unhealthy lending relationships among the institutions 
and mdc 
the failure of lincoln has been the focus of lengthy hearings 
this fall before the committee which plans to examine other sampl 
collapses including the december 1988 failure of silverado 
the lincoln case is under scrutiny because five senators alan 
cranston dcalif donald w riegle jr dmich dennis 
deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
met with regulators on lincolns behalf in april 1987 
silverado has attracted attention because of its links to mizel 
and to neil bush the presidents 34yearold son who served on 
silverados board from 1985 until august 1988 
regulators attributed the failure of silverado to substantial 
dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws rules and 
regulations the federal deposit insurance corp is examining the 
case to determine whether to file a civil suit against silverados 
officers and directors 
james moroney a former examiner at the federal home loan bank 
of topeka has alleged in interviews that silverado was in trouble 
as early as 1986 but regulators did not crack down because of the 
institutions ties to neil bush and mizel 
wall on thursday told reporters his agency looked at moroneys 
allegation and found it invalid neil bush has declined to comment 
on silverado except to say he is cooperating fully with 
investigations of the institution 
also attending the brown luncheon was bill walters another 
denver developer walters who defaulted on 41 million in real 
estate loans from silverado owned the cherry creek national bank 
which extended a 1 million line of credit to neil bushs oil and 
gas company jnb exploration 
walters was one more than 50 cochairmen of the luncheon who as 
part of accepting the title promised to sell at least 10 1000 
tickets to the event

the communist party central committee meets 
saturday amid rumors of kremlin personnel changes an impending 
general strike a growing split in the party and the first crack in 
its total dominance of soviet life 
in leningrad an estimated 40000 rankandfile communists 
rallied this week to support president mikhail s gorbachev against 
what they said was a bid to oust him 
the street meeting of leningrad progressives was held wednesday 
night to counter a nov 22 rally by conservatives several banners 
at that meeting were critical of gorbachev and his policy of 
perestroika or reconstruction of the nations political and 
economic system 
one banner shown on leningrad tv from the nov 22 rally read 
we wont let you kill communism with perestroika 
the communist party is under unprecedented pressure as 
lithuania on thursday became the first republic in the soviet union 
to drop a constitutional guarantee of communist supremacy and 
substitute a multiparty system within lithuania 
prior to the leningrad meeting activists handed out leaflets 
warning that gorbachev and his closest polituburo allies alexander 
yakovlev and foreign minister eduard shevardnadze could lose their 
party jobs at saturdays central commmittee meeting said activist 
gennady bogomolov 
he quoted the leaflet as saying everybody come to the 
meeting of protest against reactionary forces against the attempts 
to incite the convening of an extraordinary plenum of the central 
committee to demote gorbachev yakovlev and shevardnadze 
rumors of politburo shakeups abound before every central 
committee meeting since it is the only body empowered to change 
its members including gorbachev its general secretary however 
gorbachev now enjoys a measure of security since he has 
strengthened the power of the government and has been elected to a 
fiveyear term as president 
the official news agency tass said the meeting will cover 
measures for curing the sickly soviet economy the economic 
fiveyear plan that starts in 1991 and a speech by premier nikolai 
ryzhkov who handles economic matters 
the central committee was expected to prepare for the next 
session of the congress of peoples deputies the national 
parliament which convenes tuesday 
in moscow the city party committee criticized the governments 
economic reforms and called on the politburo not to take hasty 
and insufficiently considered political decisions according to 
the national tv news show vremya 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and several other 
members of parliament have called for a brief general strike monday 
to call on the congress to copy lithuanias action on the national 
level and drop article 6 from the soviet constitution the article 
guarantees the communists a leading and guiding role in soviet 
life 
the strike call received a significant dose of publicity friday 
night when vremya mentioned it several times all negatively 
on friday the official party newspaper pravda responded to the 
effort with defensive language 
under cover of such talk attempts are being made to diminish 
or even to devalue the partys prestige and to oust it out of 
active political life pravda said in an editorial that filled 
half of the front page perestroika needs the party but a 
renewed active and strong party 
but pravda also gave the clearest signal yet that the party 
might be willing to see a change in article 6 
any constitutional provision such as article 6 can be 
subjected to reevaluation modernization and even abolition 
the editorial said but it suggested that any constitutional 
changes should be delayed to a planned complete rewrite of the 
nations basic law 
the baltic republic of estonia is due to vote dec 15 on a 
proposal to drop a similar provision from its constitution on 
thursday speakers at a meeting of the communist party of estonia 
said they favor that change said harry tiido a commentator on 
official estonian radio 
the communist party in the baltic is crumbling tiido said 
we have a de facto multiparty system 
the leningrad street meeting nov 22 marked the emergence of 
leningrad communist party chief boris gidaspov as a leader of 
conservative forces 
at the counterdemonstration of progressives on wednesday 
gidaspov tried to speak but he was drowned out by shouts of 
resign resign according to fridays edition of the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda 
gidaspov was named leningrad party chief last summer since the 
holder of that position normally also gains a place on the national 
partys ruling politburo the central committee may vote on that 
issue saturday 
gidaspov replaced yuri solovyov who suffered an embarrassing 
defeat in the parliamentary elections last spring the first 
multicandidate elections in soviet history as leningrad party 
chief gidaspov normally would be expected to be named by the 
250member central committee to the ruling politburo

a monument to vladimir i lenin that has 
been a rallying point for violent antisoviet protests should be 
moved next week local officials said friday 
protesters have tried to destroy the statue during 
demonstrations in the last two weeks they have clashed with 
police who used water cannons and tear gas to disperse them 
the solidarityled national government has said it wont 
tolerate more violence and mediators have called on local 
officials to remove the monument so that order can be maintained 
on friday the steering committee of the krakow district council 
unanimously called on the president of the panel in effect the 
mayor to take steps to move the monument by tuesday the pap news 
agency reported it was not clear where the statue would be moved 
government officials have said residents should decide the fate 
of the statue to the founder of the soviet state that dominates a 
square in the krakow suburb of nowa huta built in the 1950s as a 
model socialist industrial city 
youthful demonstrators have created a delicate problem for the 
government of prime minister taduesz mazowiecki formed of former 
opposition forces who now must maintain relations with the soviet 
union 
the police action nov 29 apparently was the first largescale 
use of force against demonstrators since solidarity took over the 
government in august 
the government said thursday that hooliganism wont be 
tolerated and the police will be forced to take firmer steps in 
order to prevent such dangerous excesses 
the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza newspaper reported friday 
that one of the participants in the disturbance a 19yearold 
worker at the lenin steel mill said he and his cohorts will 
continue to riot even if the statue is moved 
not freely elected the peoples councils that form local 
governments have not yet been subject to the reform sweeping the 
central government and they are still dominated by communist party 
members

church groups and political 
opponents said friday that president fw de klerk was attempting a 
coverup by rejecting calls for an independent inquiry into 
allegations of police death squads 
police also announced that de klerk three other cabinet 
members anglican archbishop desmond tutu and the rev allan 
boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches were 
on a hit list found with a weapons cache after five members of a 
far rightwing organization were arrested 
it would seem that president de klerks political courage has 
failed him at a crucial time on a crucial issue the process 
from here onwards can only be a farce the south african council 
of churches said in response to de klerks announcement the police 
and provincial attorneys general would investigate allegations that 
police hit squads had killed opponents of the whiterun government 
the dutch reformed church the largest white denomination in 
south africa which frequently disagrees with the south african 
council of churches on political issues sent a letter to de klerk 
saying the need for an independent and public inquiry into police 
assassination units is blatant de klerk is one of the few 
cabinet members who is not a member of the church 
de klerk in his first substantive statement on the death squad 
controversy said thursday night a judicial inquiry can take 
months if not years to reach its final conclusions in the 
meanwhile a climate of suspicion and distrust could develop 
something the country can ill afford 
the national police force has been assailed for failing to solve 
dozens of killings of government opponents since 1978 
antiapartheid leaders say many people believe security personnel 
helped plan take part in or cover up such actions 
the council of churches headed by prominent antiapartheid 
clergymen such as tutu and boesak said it is clear the issue of 
the death squads is going to be covered up 
it suggested that initial prosecutions could begin as the 
judicial inquiry proceeded 
how long did the victims of the death squads have to wait 
before the south african government was forced by present 
revelations to even make a pronouncement on this matter the 
church council said 
jannie momberg a parliamentary representative of the 
antiapartheid democratic party said de klerks decision was his 
first major mistake and a tragic blunder which would explode 
in his face after the expectations raised by his enlightened 
speeches about reform and change in south africa 
justice minister kobie coetsee said two former security 
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be 
prosecuted one of them butana nofemela awaits execution for an 
unrelated murder and the other dirk coetzee is believed to have 
fled abroad 
the justice minister did not specify what charges would be 
brought against coetzee if he is extradited but said nofomela 
would be prosecuted for the 1982 murder of durban attorney 
griffiths mxenge 
coetzee nofomela and a third former security policemen have 
said in newspaper interviews or sworn affidavits that they took 
part in death squad operations in the early and mid1980s on orders 
of superiors many of whom still occupy high positions in the 
police 
several police officers will be investigated and five have been 
suspended from duty until inquiries or legal proceedings are 
completed de klerk said 
also friday majgen jaap joubert of the detective branch said 
there was a plan by the rightwingers arrested tueaday to attack de 
klerk law and order minister adriaan vlok defense minister magnus 
malan and foreign minister pik botha to create chaos in the 
country 
he said police had been monitoring the five who had broken away 
from the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement joubert said 
charges pending against the five include murder armed robbery and 
violations of the arms and explosives acts 
he did not specify who the group may have murdered but a 
progovernment newspaper the citizen said thursday police were 
investigating the possibility that blacks had been killed as 
practice for attacks on the political targets

foreign anticommunist forces have never given up their plot to 
subvert the proletarian dictatorship in china for even a single 
day he said 
chinese leaders and the official media have heaped praise on the 
army for its role in the violent suppression of prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing on june 34 
it has said the studentled movement was a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion aiming to overthrow the 
government and backed by foreign agitators the government has 
never identified the alleged foreign backers although about a 
dozen people were arrested as spies for taiwan 
chen said education in national defense generally on the wane 
in china since the late 1960s when mao tsetung called for mass 
preparations to fight what was thought to be an impending soviet 
invasion will unite the country politically and be economically 
productive 
such education he said is essential in the present domestic 
and international situation 
despite an intense propaganda campaign the reputation of the 
army was tarnished by the june attack on beijing in which hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of beijing residents were shot by soldiers 
the communist partys peoples daily this week published 
instructions on how local governments should praise the army so the 
masses will love it 
military training also has been stepped up the entire 
firstyear class at beijing university one of the centers of 
student activism this spring has been ordered to undergo a year of 
schooling at a camp in a city outside beijing

the trial of howard pappy mason neared its 
conclusion friday with prosecutors saying the accused drug kingpin 
ordered the murder of a police officer to seal his position as a 
drug world leader 
he did something that only someone impressed with his own 
power would do he could have cared less which police officer was 
killed said assistant us attorney leslie caldwell in bringing 
her case to a close you lose respect you lose control 
mason 31 is on trial in us district court facing 
racketeering and conspiracy charges that include ordering from his 
jail cell the feb 26 1988 murder of officer edward byrne 
following instructions from us district judge edward r 
korman the panel was expected to begin deliberating later friday 
afternoon 
four of masons associates were convicted earlier this year of 
killing the 22yearold rookie as he sat in his patrol car guarding 
the home of a witness in a drug case in the neighborhood in the 
borough of queens where masons drug ring the bebos operated 
when pappy mason gave the order to kill a police officer it 
was like pushing a button and four workers did it without 
questioning why caldwell said 
mason jailed on a state weapons charge continued his courtroom 
boycott court officials have hooked up a closedcircuit tv to 
allow the defendant to watch the proceedings from a courthouse 
holding cell 
masons lawyer harry c batchelder jr said the government had 
not come close to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that mason had 
ordered the slaying 
repeating his earlier arguments batchelder told the jury the 
prosecution had produced only hearsay evidence that mason 
ordered the slaying he said the governments witnesses a 
collection of admitted murderers drug addicts and thieves given 
deals for their cooperation were absolutely incredible 
when you make a pact with people like this they will sing the 
french national anthem backwards to you to save their skins 
batchelder said 
in a bit of courtroom melodrama the brawny lawyer waved before 
the panel a plea agreement in which a witness had promised to tell 
the truth likening the lies he said it contained to judas 
betrayal of christ 
this piece of paper is the equivalent of 13 pieces of silver 
this piece of paper is the guarantor of nothing batchelder said 
its an agreement if youll dance to my tune ill pay for it 
mason who allegedly began dealing crack and cocaine about five 
years ago in south jamaica queens one of the citys most 
notorious drug battle grounds went to trial 10 days ago on an 
11count federal drug conspiracy indictment if convicted he faces 
mandatory life imprisonment 
most of the other members of his violent drug ring have either 
been convicted or have pleaded guilty to drug charges

the government began talks with 
opposition parties and other groups friday to negotiate a peaceful 
transition to democracy and avert economic collapse but initial 
reaction from the opposition was negative 
there was no agreement on anything there are major 
differences of opinion said peter toelgyessy of the league of 
free democrats it was all right if we just view it as an 
opportunity to exchange views 
topics discussed were the economy a date for general elections 
which will turn hungary into a fullfledged parliamentary democracy 
for the first time since the communist coup in 1948 and how the 
new parties can become involved in the decisionmaking process 
government spokesman zsolt bajnok made it clear there was no 
discussion on transforming the present cabinet into a coalition 
government 
the idea was not even raised he said 
fridays talks opened a threeday series 
toelgyessy told reporters every time the government is in 
trouble it talks about involving the opposition in no way are we 
going to assume even partial responsibility for this economic 
fiasco 
while not thinking in coalition terms the government was 
hoping bajnok said for political legitimation of government 
decisions 
bajnok told reporters the opposition parties assured premier 
miklos nemeth it would not exploit hungarys difficulties for 
shortterm political gain and several promised to support the 
government in its hard decisions 
nemeth told them his government is not using the talks as a 
device to save itself the situation is much too serious for such 
games bajnok quoted him as saying 
hard decisions that lie ahead include an austerity budget to be 
submitted to parliament this month and possible bankruptcy 
proceedings against unprofitable enterprises which will abruptly 
boost unemployment 
major debate also centered on a general elections date 
the governing hungarian socialist party which has disavowed the 
communist monopoly on power and even changed its name favors feb 
28 the big opposition parties favor march 11 or 18 many smaller 
parties want parliament to go full term until june some even 
proposed early fall to give them more time to prepare

thousands of weary villagers returned 
to houses shattered by a monthlong mortar and artillery battle 
that ended with guerrillas in control of this strategic town near 
the thai border 
guerrillas captured svay chek on thursday morning and the people 
came home in the afternoon in a file of oxcarts loaded with 
children and belongings that stretched for well over a mile down 
the road 
villagers said more than 800 government soldiers were killed or 
wounded during the long battle the guerrillas said they lost at 
least 20 fighters and had more than 50 wounded 
the khmer peoples national liberation front drove the army from 
the town opening the way for an attack on nearby sisophon where 
the vietnamsponsored cambodian government has a military 
operations center 
field commanders said the guerrillas also seized six other 
nearby positions and pushed more than 10000 soldiers back toward 
sisophon 
if i had known before there were that many i wouldnt have 
attacked guerrilla gen khun roeng said of the defenders 
retreating government troops pounded the area with artillery 
fire all day thursday guerrillas said 10 people were killed and 30 
wounded in one village south of svay chek 
it was the seventh insurgent attack on the town since late 
september when vietnam pulled its forces out of cambodia after 
more than a decade of occupation 
this is the most important victory in the 10 years we have 
been fighting the vietnamese and their puppet government said 
gen sak sutsakarn the guerrilla commander for the area 
hours after their victory more than 1000 rebels moved into 
trenches the government forces had dug around the town they found 
the bodies of soldiers in the trenches 
rebel commanders assaulted svay chek from three directions 
thursday they celebrated victory with whiskey and their men fired 
thousands of bursts of gunfire in the air 
some guerrillas searched government buildings for souvenirs 
many wore hats pins and scarves they said came from the bodies of 
government soldiers 
more than 1000 weapons mortars and artillary pieces were 
captured along with 4000 cases of ammunition two tanks four 
heavy trucks and an armored personnel carrier 
army defectors still in uniform and armed mingled with the 
guerrillas wounded government soldiers were taken to medical 
stations in the jungle 
how many of you are left hiding in the forest a guerrilla 
asked one of the wounded who replied they are all gone they 
all fled 
sak appealed to the world to provide food and medicine to the 
more than 50000 civilians he said are in guerrillacontrolled 
areas of cambodia 
we want peace he said but to reach peace we have to 
combine military and political action the political action has 
failed in paris and until it succeeds the war will continue 
an alliance of two noncommunist guerrilla groups and the khmer 
rouge a communist fighting force that is by far the strongest is 
fighting the government of premier hun sen 
talks on a negotiated settlement and a possible un transition 
role were held in paris earlier this year but ended without 
agreement 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and overthrew the 
brutal khmer rouge regime of pol pot which took over the country 
after the indochina war ended in april 1975 and was blamed for more 
than 1 million deaths

federal regulators seized new jerseys largest 
savings bank friday after the institution recorded large losses 
from real estate ventures in new jersey florida and texas 
the government transferred control of city federal savings bank 
in bedminster nj to the resolution trust corp a new federal 
agency created in august to dispose of failed institutions 
city federal was below all its capital requirements it 
doesnt look to us like they could recapitalize this institution 
without federal assistance said bob albanese senior deputy 
director of the federal office of thrift supervision in new york 
and the institution is continuing to experience operations 
losses and loan losses albanese said 
chief executive officer john atherton other top city federal 
officers and the thrifts board of directors were removed and 
replaced by a managing agent and an oversight team while some 
managers were retained he said 
city federal savings bank officials could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
the savings bank had 98 billion in assets and 73 billion in 
858348 deposit accounts according to the federal resolution trust 
corp which has taken control of about 280 thrifts and has 
disposed of more than 30 nationwide 
the agency will either help find a buyer for the institution or 
decide to liquidate it city federal has 105 retail branches in new 
jersey and florida 
the office of thrift supervision announced rtc would oversee 
operations of a new federal mutual association city savings bank 
which will maintain normal business hours and operations while a 
permanent resolution is sought 
for right now its business as usual said albanese 
word of the thrifts potential collapse had been discussed in 
the industry since the institution posted thirdquarter losses 
its not surprising said william mccrystal an analyst with 
ryan beck and co in west orange nj this is a large 
institution this is a sign of whats going to happen in the 
northeast this says the government is going to follow through on 
the legislation passed to do something about these large troubled 
thrifts 
mccrystal said city federal was plagued by bad commercial real 
estate and construction loans after becoming heavily involved in 
real estate and mortgage banking 
as of sept 30 city federal had 747 million in nonperforming 
assets which are pastdue loans and loans that dont pay interest 
and only 89 million in equity compared with 3262 million at the 
end of 1988 
under normal conditions nonperforming assets are no more 
than 25 percent of equity mccrystal said with 89 million in 
equity their losses probably would have wiped out equity had the 
feds not stepped in 
the thrift had said last month it would be unable to meet new 
capital requirements that became effective thursday under the 
thrift bailout law signed this past summer 
four other new jersey thrifts already have been taken over by 
federal regulators

czechoslovakia appeared headed 
friday toward a federal government that will put communists in the 
minority for the first time since 1948 
for the first time the communists representatives of the four 
other small parties permitted in czechoslovakia and the opposition 
held what a communist spokesman called round table talks to discuss 
the new government 
the talks followed weeks of historic concessions by the 
communists to the nations emboldened opposition movement which 
has filled the streets with prodemocracy protesters and threatened 
a general strike monday unless reforms are made 
marian calfa the communist tapped to form a government after 
premier ladislav adamec resigned thursday said on national tv 
friday that roughly one half of the new government could be 
composed of experts with no political affiliation 
the other half of the cabinet seats would go to the communists 
and members of the four other political parties government 
spokesman marcel jansen said 
the communist party is convinced that the most important thing 
is that they are competent and professional party spokesman 
josef hora said the political affiliation is only secondary 
socialist jan skoda who attended the meeting said it is 
possible that the communists could end up in a small minority in 
the new government 
in other developments 
the republic of slovakias communist premier pavel hrivnak 
and his entire 15member cabinet resigned or were fired the state 
news agency ctk said former justice minister milan cic was asked 
to form a new cabinet 
hardline communist president gustav husak issued an amnesty 
aimed at meeting opposition demands to release all political 
prisoners federal prosecutor jan pjescak resigned 
foreign minister jaromir johanes asked the government to 
replace 21 of the countrys ambassadors 
after the talks recessed for the day ctk reported that calfa 
will meet on saturday night with those who attended the opening 
talks to try to have a new government sworn in by sunday he did 
not take part in fridays discussions 
ctk quoted bohuslav kucera chairman of the small socialist 
party as saying fridays meetings helped all parties involved 
reach a great consensus that should enable calfa to form a new 
government 
jansen and opposition sources earlier friday said the talks 
would be complicated and cautioned against expecting agreement on a 
new government too soon 
the first session of talks began at 3 pm at pragues palace of 
culture a modern structure used for concerts and large communist 
party gatherings 
a second round of talks lasted about 90 minutes ctk said 
opposition leader vaclav havel attended as did three other former 
dissidents the opposition has suggested join the government 
havel said the results will be published soon but declined 
to be more specific 
vasil mohorita a member of the ruling politburo said a 
government representing all parts of the political spectrum 
will be named sunday he did not elaborate 
slovak activist jan carnogursky said certain gains have been 
won and it has been agreed that all the political interests will be 
represented 
he said it was possible he would become a deputy prime minister 
all three spoke after the meetings ended 
a government named dec 3 by adamec included only five 
noncommunists in a 21member cabinet and left communists in 
control of all key ministries the announcement prompted widespread 
outrage and a new round of demonstrations 
demands mounted all week for more genuine powersharing with 
the small peoples party once a docile ally of the communists but 
now more outspoken proposing the 5050 divide between party and 
nonparty members 
besides the communists the peoples party and the socialist 
party are permitted in the czech lands and the freedom and renewal 
parties in slovakia 
peoples party chief josef bartonicek said his party backs the 
opposition candidate for first deputy premier carnogursky 
carnogursky was barred from practicing law after he signed the 
charter 77 human rights document he was arrested in august and was 
in jail awaiting trial on slander charges until his release was 
granted by husak in a first wave of concessions to the opposition 
two weeks ago 
politburo members mohorita and ondrej saling represented the 
communist party at the talks hora said 
husaks future is expected to be discussed at the talks 
husak 76 is the last of the hardliners associated with the 
1968 crackdown on reform left in power the opposition has demanded 
his resignation and appears to be pushing havel as a possible 
president 
husak issued an amnesty that covered prisoners jailed on a broad 
range of 14 charges including incitement defamation of the 
socialist system and religious rulings frequently used to imprison 
dissidents and religious activists 
husak already has released or cleared at least a dozen political 
prisoners whose release was demanded by the opposition 
the opposition had demanded pjescaks resignation and that of 
the prosecutor in the czech region accusing them of putting 
communist party interests above the law and failing to investigate 
police brutality against peaceful student demonstrators on nov 17 
the police crackdown stirred up the mass prodemocracy movement 
in the past three weeks mass prodemocracy demonstrations led 
by the civic forum opposition and its slovak counterpart public 
against violence have forced the communists to relinquish their 
41year monopoly on political power 
in washington the state department praised the czechoslovak 
people for showing courage and determination in demanding free 
elections civil liberties and rule of law

an expected federal court appearance by 
arizona millionaire charles h keating whose lawsuit accuses the 
government of illegally seizing his lincoln savings and loan 
association friday was postponed until january 
after spending the day listening to a phoenix investor describe 
details of what regulators called a land swap to siphon federally 
insured deposits out of irvine califbased lincoln us district 
judge stanley sporkin recessed a hearing in the case until jan 2 
sporkin held open the possibility he might reconvene the hearing 
on short notice to allow keatings attorneys to crossexamine 
federal thrift regulators if an opening occurs on his docket during 
the next three weeks 
however attorneys for both the government and keating said they 
do not expect the beleagured phoenix millionaire to be called as a 
witness until jan 3 at the earliest 
keating filed the suit last may a month after the federal home 
loan bank board seized control of his sampl alleging that it has 
lost up to 25 billion in federlly insured desposits 
since then the government has filed a 11 billion fraud and 
racketeering suit of its own against keating and a federal grand 
jury in los angeles is weighing possible criminal charges against 
him 
a similar suit has been filed against keating by several of an 
estimated 23000 investors who bought junk bonds in lincolns 
parent company american continental corp the bonds were rendered 
virtually worthless when the holding company filed for court 
protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws last april 
last month keating invoked a fifth amendment privilege against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify before the house banking 
committee about the operation of lincoln his attorneys declined 
this week to comment on whether he would again decline to testify 
before sporkin 
on friday the judge heard phoenix businessman phillip gordon 
describe a pair of transactions he conducted with lincoln and 
american continental in january 1988 that enabled the thrift to 
record a 44 million profit on the sale of 445 acres of desert 
land west of phoenix 
kevin oconnell deputy director of the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervison had testified thursday that the deal 
was a sham because gordon and his associates had no ability to 
make the 6 million purchase 
but as a result of the deal oconnell said american 
continental which is chaired by keating was able to siphon 18 
million out of lincoln in the form of future tax liabilities 
collected on behalf of the government but never paid 
gordon testified that he bought the desert land from lincoln 
last jan 29 making a down payment of 15 million and financing 
the other 45 million through a nonrecourse loan from the sampl 
a day earlier gordon said his sun olive limited partnership 
had sold a 135acre parcel it owned in west phoenix to american 
continental for 42 million 15 million above the 27 million 
that he and his partners had paid for it 13 months earlier 
he said that he and american continental officials had worked 
out the deal in a conversation days earlier even though land values 
in the phoenix area were stagnant at the time 
at some point we had discussed that the money for the down 
payment would be coming from the sun olive sale gordon said 
regulators have cited the transaction as an example by which 
lincoln used land swaps and straw purchasers to record hundreds of 
millions of dollars in phony real estate profits enabling the 
thrift to attract some 4 billion in new federally insured deposits 
under keatings ownership 
just through a taxsharing agreement alone american continental 
was able to siphon off 94 million of those deposits in the form of 
deferred taxes never actually paid to the internal revenue service 
the government alleges 
the regulators have acknowledged they approved the taxsharing 
accord in 1986 but they claim that its nature was 
misrepresented to them by american continental and lincoln 
officials 
under federal sampl laws they said a thrift and its holding 
company can comingle current taxes owed by each but not deferred 
taxes

search vessels struggled through a 
savage storm in the gulf of st lawrence on friday but found none 
of the 39 seamen missing since two cargo ships sank in raging seas 
coast guard officials said the 400foot capitaine torres and 
270foot johanna b disappeared thursday night in towering seas 
high winds and bitter cold about 120 miles apart and north of cape 
breton 
it said all of the 23 crewmen aboard the capitaine torres and 16 
on the johanna b were foreigners including many filipinos 
lt jeff agnew at the search center in halifax said the coast 
guard ship sir william grenfell battling waves as high as a 
twostory building had recovered two empty life rafts and the 
wreckage of a third in the area where the capitaine torres 
disappeared 
agnew reported the captain of the grenfell says he is 
convinced he did see some people two or more on one of the 
rafts but the wave action on the raft was severe he saw it take 
a few severe hits 
when he managed to get alongside it was empty 
the capitaine torres ship had sent a distress call saying the 
cargo had shifted causing it to list badly and its crew was 
abandoning ship in enclosed rubber rafts about 36 miles north of 
cape breton the vessel carried two such rafts and two wooden life 
boats 
it was en route to taiwan with container cargo and the crew 
included french fijian dutch filipino and vanuatu seaman

the coast guard lost contact with the panamianianregistered 
johanna b shortly after it sent out a mayday signal late thursday 
from a point 120 miles northwest of the capitaine torres 
an agent in sorel quebec for the johanna b said the ship had a 
cargo of iron ingots and all of the crewmen were filipinos 
an armed forces rescue aircraft dispatched to the zone where 
the capitaine torres disappeared was diverted to the smaller 
johanna b with a pump military spokesman said the plane was 
believed to be about 10 minutes away from the sinking ship when the 
signals ended and it could find no traces of the vessel 
the plane turned back when navigational aids began failing 
because of an ice buildup 
they didnt see anything said capt claude tardif of 
canadian forces base summerside the visibility was about a 
quarter of a mile in severe turbulence and icing conditions 
it was as bad a day as weve had this fall said wallace 
meade owner of a 66foot fishing trawler in port aux basques 
newfoundland the nearest port to the lost ships i wouldnt have 
gone out in that in a 500footer 
maritime officials said the capitaine torres carrying cargo 
from portage ind radioed a distress call after some containers 
slid overboard in a violent shift of cargo they said the capitaine 
torres was built by hyundai of south korea in 1978 and flew the 
flag of vanuatu but was owned by a company in new caledonia a 
south pacific island 
the johanna b was loaded with 4600 tons of pig iron and en 
route to darrow la 
crew members of the grenfell and other coast guard ships 
returned to work in spite of a monthold strike by civilian 
employees of federal government ships 
the strikers had said they would respond to emergencies 
civilians in the grenfell crew left the picket line beside the ship 
and went aboard when the distress calls came in said union

the new york city bar association said in 
a report released friday that torture has been commonly used in 
turkish police stations and the turkish legal system failed to 
respond to it 
the 111page report said torture remained widespread despite 
turkeys ratification of the european human rights convention and 
the un convention against torture as well as prohibitions 
against torture in turkish law 
the findings torture in turkey the legal systems response 
were prepared by a delegation of four lawyers from the 
associations committee on international human rights 
turkey had no immediate response in the past government 
officials denied torture was practiced systematically saying there 
were only isolated incidents described as police brutality 
the delegation said it visited turkey from may 28 to june 8 and 
met judges government officials prosecutors lawyers former 
prisoners and detainees 
the report said torture is often used during the 15day period 
in which prisoners can be held incommunicado after arrest

detainees on the soles of their feet hanging them by their wrists 
hosing them with cold water applying electric shocks punching and 
kicking yanking people by the hair assaults with truncheons 
rolling the detainee inside a tire and sexual and psychological 
abuse

leaders of the 12nation european 
community closing ranks amid upheaval in eastern europe agreed 
friday to press ahead with an economic and monetary union despite 
british opposition 
the decision on the opening day of a twoday summit means the 
ec will convene a special conference in december 1990 to start 
negotiations for the adoption of a single currency and to set up a 
system of central banks 
the agreement came after france and west germany overrode 
objections by british prime minister margaret thatcher that radical 
monetary integration will rob member countries of sovereign rights 
to decide national economic policy 
in another blow to mrs thatcher the leaders agreed with her 
alone dissenting to adopt a nonbinding social charter 
setting out communitywide rights for labor unions wages and 
welfare 
over dinner the leaders considered a draft political 
declaration that called for intensified political dialogue and 
cooperation with the soviet union and other reformminded nations 
of eastern europe 
west german chancellor helmut kohl west german sources said 
also hoped to insert a clause expressing support for german 
reunification 
but french foreign minister roland dumas reported several 
delegations rejected the german phrasing 
he said the french proposed different phrasing calling for 
reinforcement of peace in europe that would lead to germany 
recovering its unity the political declaration states that 
recovery must be carried out democratically and peacefully 
dumas said 
the final declaration due to be issued saturday was expected 
to reaffirm the present borders of east and west germany 
concern has been expressed about the oderneisse border between 
east germany and poland and a reunified germanys possible claim to 
parts of poland populated by ethnic germans 
the leaders also gave their backing to a french proposal to 
create a european development bank to help the economies of 
emerging democracies in eastern europe but left the details to be 
worked out 
the deal on the monetary union conference was sealed after kohl 
bowed to pressure by the summit host french president francois 
mitterrand to fix december 1990 as the launch date 
kohl had hoped to delay the conference start until early 1991 
after west german elections scheduled on dec 9 1990 
abolishing west germanys strong mark currency is an electorally 
sensitive subject 
the intergovernmental conference on monetary union will mark 
the start of what are likely to be several years of negotiations to 
make necessary amendments to the ecs 1957 founding treaty 
britain will attend the conference in what thatcher aides 
described as a spirit of constructive argument 
treaty changes require unanimity and britain can veto any final 
move to abolish national currencies or set up the single central 
bank system 
dutch premier ruud lubbers said the agreement to hold the 
conference was politically very important 
it puts pressure on the member states this monetary 
integration is a tall order said lubbers 
mitterrand had sought a dramatic move toward greater unity at 
the summit in this city on the frenchgerman border 
he argues that western nations must move closer to form a strong 
and stable force that can reach out to encourage and help the 
emerging democracies of eastern europe 
it is important for france a french source said of the 
decision to fix a date for the monetary conference because we 
know it is with precise dates that we advance 
no formal votes were taken friday and only mrs thatcher 
objected during the closeddoor discussions on the monetary 
conference and the social charter 
she says the charter will increase unemployment raise costs and 
make ec goods less competitive 
during a pause after the monetary union decision the convention 
center including the room where the leaders were meeting was 
blacked out in a fiveminute power cut 
mrs thatcher had hoped to focus discussion in strasbourg on the 
practical agenda of completing the single barrierfree market which 
the community is due to become at the end of 1992 and on the ecs 
response to events in eastern europe 
lubbers said the summit would culminate in sending a message 
of encouragement to those people in eastern europe who are the 
driving forces of reform it is a revolution without violence 
you must encourage that

experts expressed concern friday that the 
rampage by a man who shot to death 14 women might not be an 
isolated case of such attitudes toward females and especially 
feminists 
television talk shows and newspaper editorials focused on the 
massacre wednesday the worst in canadas history thirteen people 
remained hospitalized friday all were expected to recover 
the gunman identified by police as marc lepine 25 emerged as 
a loner who blamed women for his troubles in life lepine shot 
himself to death after his assault at the university of montreals 
engineering school 
all the victims were between the ages of 21 and 31 and all but 
one were students a joint funeral for 10 victims was scheduled 
monday at montreals notre dame cathedral 
the tragedy should persuade us to look intensely at the ground 
in which hatred takes root torontos globe and mail which 
describes itself as canadas national newspaper said in an 
editorial it is time for men to talk with men about their 
continuing oppression of women sadly it is still a time when 
women have reason to be afraid 
michael kaufman a political scientist blamed the incident in 
part on society 
it was both aberrant and not aberrant kaufman said on the 
cbcs midday program these attitudes are bred so young 
boys learn to solve conflicts through violence 
a conflict recently attracted national attention at queens 
university in kingston ontario when female students staged a 
no means no campaign against date rape male students 
responded by posting sarcastic signs as no means more beer 
witnesses to the attack wednesday quoted lepine as screaming i 
want the women and youre all a bunch of feminists i hate 
feminists 
six women died in one classroom after lepine separated the men 
from the women and opened fire on the women 
a threepage handwritten letter found on lepines body blamed 
women for much of his unhappiness 
jacques duchesneau a senior police investigator said that when 
things werent going well with a woman he would just stop the 
relationship right there and never come back to the person he was 
talking with 
duchesneau said lepine had taken chemistry courses apparently in 
hopes of entering the engineering school although no indication 
exists that he applied he said feminists have always ruined his 
life that he wasnt too happy in life particularly in the last 
seven years duchesneau said 
prime minister brian mulroney and his wife mila were among the 
visitors thursday night to the engineering school which closed in 
mourning and postponed final examinations for four days 
this man singled out women in a completely criminal and 
insensitive fashion he said it is an isolated incident but 
it raises questions about violence in our society and about 
violence against women 
police said lepine had been obsessed by war movies and 
apparently browsed regularly at gunshops he bought his weapon a 
223caliber semiautomatic rifle at a hunting shop nov 21 
lepine lived in a secondfloor apartment on a narrow 
workingclass street in central montreal 
neighbors described him as a man always in a hurry 
he was always running up and down the stairs said gerard 
claveau 67 who lives with his wife next door to the lepine 
apartment 
he didnt strike me as a normal person he had these strange 
eyes sort of cold 
another neighbor chantal dumais said she often had the feeling 
someone in the lepine apartment was watching her through a window 
she said once when she was changing in her bedroom she realized 
someone was peering into her room from lepines apartment she said 
she then heard someone laughing like crazy 
neighbors said lepine lived with another man who apparently 
moved out of the threestory building about a month ago 
claveau said lepines mother who lives nearby with his sister 
used to visit her sons apartment a couple times a month

thousands of people jammed the 
narrow streets of pragues old quarter friday on the anniversary of 
john lennons death to ask communist leaders to give peace a 
chance 
while party officials drew up a list of future government 
officials in talks with the opposition across town 5000 young 
people gathered for the annual ceremony honoring the former beatle 
who was shot to death dec 8 1980 outside his new york city 
apartment house 
candles and sparklers shone in the frosty clear night while 
lennons lyrics echoed under the archway of beautiful charles 
bridge all we are saying is give peace a chance 
speakers read letters from throughout the country supporting the 
peaceful democratic revolution that has embraced czechoslovakia 
since midnovember 
the anniversary observance illegal until last year is held at 
the lennon wall a stretch of concrete once covered with 
slogans extolling peace and the pop star 
we believe lennon was a fighter for freedom and that is what 
we are doing here too is fighting for freedom said 17yearold 
madla vacklova whose little sister accompanied her 
she said she believed in expressing her political beliefs and 
this is something we can do here now 
reforms taking place in czechoslovakia are due in large part to 
the young a peaceful student demonstration nov 17 that ended in 
police violence shocked the nation and inspired mass protests that 
forced the communist party to negotiate with the opposition 
the lennon celebration has special meaning for young czechs it 
was one of the first expressions of a desire for change by those 
born after a sovietled invasion crushed the prague spring of 
reform in 1968 
on friday the mood was by turns festive and subdued dozens of 
young soldiers could be seen in groups of two or three among 
students in pastel parkas and wool coats 
last year on lennon day we were forbidden to leave the 
barracks said a 20yearold sergeant who would not give his 
name also to tell you the truth this was under surveillance 
and they were guarding the streets 
his comrade said this year its all different we want to 
come with all the others to show our support for change 
on the bridge above the crowd small groups of people sang 
beatles songs often accompanied by guitars 
on the old kings road other young people sang christmas carols 
a cappella as they have for as long as anyone can remember

earth is wracked by quakes floods slides 
storms and volcanoes not to mention an occasional 100000megaton 
whack from an asteroid but sitting ducks can fight back 
geophysicists said friday 
as the american geophysical union ended its fiveday fall 
meeting suggestions for reducing death and destruction from 
natural hazards included requiring tornado shelters in mobile home 
parks planning land use to avoid quake and slide damage and 
steering incoming asteroids away from earth 
an asteroid twothirds of a mile wide hits earth about every 
300000 years and today it could kill more than half earths 
population because of climate and direct effects of a blast equal 
to 77 million hiroshimasized atomic bombs said clark chapman of 
the planetary science institute in tucson ariz and david 
morrison of nasas ames research center in mountain view 
conservatively assuming a 50year human lifespan that means any 
person has about a onein6000 chance of being killed by an 
asteroid during their lifetime compared with an americans 
onein20000 chance of dying on a plane crash or onein50000 
chance of being killed by a tornado said the pair who wrote the 
book cosmic catastrophes 
this is in fact a real hazard chapman said were in a 
shooting gallery 
even a small asteroid impact could be mistaken for a nuclear 
attack he said it might trigger a nuclear attack 
one asteroid passed within 500000 miles of earth this year 
about twice the moons distance and a small one devastated an 
uninhabited part of siberia in 1908 so it makes sense for society 
to better evaluate likely consequences of a collision and use 
telescopes to provide years notice of incoming asteroids chapman 
said 
its within our technical capabilities to design a space 
mission to nudge the asteroid out of the way by using special 
rocket engines or perhaps hbombs although bombs might break an 
asteroid into more deadly fragments he said it would be an 
apolloproject level of expense 
most scientists discussed more common natural disasters during 
fridays session 
its absolutely imperative we insist mobile home parks have 
secure underground shelters in tornado and hurricaneprone 
regions said joseph golden senior meterologist for the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration 
golden said home designers need to pay more attention to 
windresistant cladding for buildings and build homes with 
interior closets and bathrooms which often are the only parts of a 
house left standing after a bad hurricane 
better effort also is needed to predict hurricane tracks and 
intensities and to learn if building codes are adequate for 
typical wind speeds he added 
us geological survey volcanologist robert tilling said 25000 
people died during the nevado del ruiz volcano eruption in colombia 
in 1985 because local officials ignored hazard maps signs of 
impending eruption and formal warnings by scientists 
he called for better communication between scientists and 
officials increased monitoring of volcanoes that now go unwatched 
in developing nations and improvements in predicting volcanic 
activity 
earl brabb a usgs geologist said it is a national disgrace 
that there is a lack of aerial photographs to identify areas prone 
to deadly landslides which cause tens of billions of dollars 
damage globally each year 
the agency has prepared detailed landslide susceptibility maps 
for san mateo county south of san francisco and county officials 
used the maps to rezone hazard areas to very low density housing 
brabb said 
the geological survey also operates a landslide warning system 
in the bay area and is establishing one in honolulu warnings are 
relayed to the public through the weather service and news media 
if your house is adjacent to a steep slope or at the top of a 
steep slope you might consider going to a motel for the weekend 
after a warning brabb said 
geological survey seismologist william ellsworth said 
researchers are getting better at making longterm forecasts of 
which segments of faults are prone to destructive quakes 
he said emergency officials believe public safety during the 
deadly oct 17 san francisco bay area quake was improved because 
people made preparations after scientists warned in 1988 that the 
san andreas fault was due for a jolt near the bays south end 
scientists need to spend more time identifying specific sites 
prone to quake damage and be more aggressive using such knowledge 
to influence landuse decisions such as construction on filled 
land vulnerable to intense shaking 
mark meier of the university of colorado urged more detailed 
study of future sea level rises so society can save a lot of 
money with land use planning designed to prevent damage from 
storm surges and other effects

attorney they just wonder what he was writing down what about 
their private lives is in a nissan file somewhere they feel 
violated they really do 
nissan denied the couples claims in a statement issued friday

fact that he worked for nissan and that he was in the us to 
better understand us lifestyles and attitudes about cars the 
company said 
nissan said that not only was morimoto not secretive he was 
plainly seen in the neighborhood photographing various cars homes 
and garages 
the lawsuit filed thursday in orange county superior court 
seeks a court order forbidding nissan from placing alleged 
corporate emissaries into the homes of other unsuspecting families

the lawsuit claims the 29yearold morimoto misrepresented and 
concealed the reason for his sixweek stay with the couple and 
their two daughters

newspaper advertisement to find homes for japanese students 
placement services said no students were available but suggested 
morimoto who moved in on june 16 
ms kaufman said the family knew morimoto worked for nissan but 
thought he had been temporarily assigned to the firms us 
headquarters in carson 
morimoto stayed until july 31 the family learned of morimotos 
alleged mission in october when the los angeles times reported 
that morimoto had been dispatched to costa mesa as part of an 
effort to design a future car model designed especially for the 
us market 
the newspaper article on southern california car culture said 
morimoto was to unearth the lifestyle of an american town and 
was among several operatives lured there by its trendsetting 
image 
in its statement however nissan said the article was 
actually sent to the french family by nissan because we thought 
they would enjoy it 
the lawsuit also named makoto tachikawa a product strategy 
director for nissan and two organizations involved in placing 
morimoto in the home the academic recruit communication 
international of los angeles and the japanese american cultural 
center

for the other group terry terasaki an assistant to gachiey 
nomura the head of academic recruit communication said mrs 
nomura was out of town friday and the only person who could discuss 
the case in detail 
terasaki acknowledged that his organization placed morimoto in 
the frenches home but said he had learned of the couples

gannett tinker said just made a strategic decision that its 
tv production a business that they would just as soon not be in 
since its not connected to what they do 
and the fact we did not come out of the gate too quickly 
probably helped them make the decision 
gtg currently produces one network series baywatch which 
nbc recently approved for a full season 
it also has gotten got cbs approval for a pilot for a comedy 
series peace of cake and has three syndicated series in the 
works two of which probably would be shown at a national programs 
convention next month in new orleans he said 
work on all those will continue he said while arrangements are 
made for a new partner to replace gannett he said there have been 
inquiries but that nothing will be done until we can take 
inventory 
he expects that process to be finished the middle of next week 
he said in a phone interview from gtg offices in culver city ca 
tinker also said he doesnt want to return to network life but 
that two top producers considered to head cbs programs department 
would be great for cbs 
he referred to the team of marcy carsey and tom werner whose 
carseywerner co produces network televisions two toprated 
series nbcs the cosby show and abcs roseanne 
until late friday when their negotiations with thirdplace cbs 
ended unsuccessfully they were being wooed by it to run cbs 
entertainment the networks top programs job the post was left 
open last week when kim lemasters resigned after only two years in 
it 
tinker who spoke before the negotiations were called off had 
said he hoped the two executives would join cbs because i think 
that would be great for cbs and for those of us who want to do 
business with cbs 
credited with helping lead nbc to first in prime time ratings 
before he left the company in 1986 tinker laughed when asked if 
cbs at some point had asked him about taking over lemasters job 
oh no he replied then in a joking reference to his old 
chairmans job at nbc said hey youre demoting me he said 
he had no desire to return to network life nor was i asked to 
by cbs

president bush spoke glowingly friday of improving 
relations with the soviet union saying his summit meeting with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was aimed toward peace rich 
with the promise of permanence 
yes there were differences at malta he said but he added 
we can express them in an agreeable and forceful way without 
being disagreeable 
bush made his remarks at a fundraiser for rep hank brown a 
colorado republican running for the senate 
the presidents comments about ussoviet relations were upbeat 
throughout with no mention of his negative comments the night 
before when he told a houston audience that soviet activities with 
cuba and nicaragua weigh heavily on the relationship 
bush said he envisions the decade of the 1990s as filled with 
optimism hope and a sense of new beginnings and he heralded 
new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what used to be called 
the iron curtain 
earlier this week a senior administration official commenting 
anonymously had characterized gorbachevs economic views as 
simplistic and vice president dan quayle had made remarks less 
rosy than bush did on his return from the summit 
however presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater quickly 
disavowed the simplistic quote on behalf of the white house 
and quayle said in an interview with the soviet newspaper 
izvestia released friday that he regarded the summit as a very 
positive meeting that could lead to conclusion of an agreement on 
strategic nuclear arms by next summer 
so were very hopeful for improved relationship for new 
opportunities for reduction of tensions quayle said he added 
but as we are hopeful we must also maintain our preparedness 
and that we will do 
bush has used his series of speeches at republican fundraising 
events over the past two days to reflect on his summit meeting with 
gobachev 
in des moines iowa friday night at a fundraising banquet for 
rep tom tauke a 1990 senate contender bush said from malta 
came initiatives to nurture europes tide toward democracy 
accelerate arms control and expand trade 
he reiterated his goal of granting the soviet union 
mostfavorednation trade status by the time he and gorbachev meet 
next spring in the united states 
this will relax trade barriers between east and west 
expanding markets for american agricultural and other exports 
bush said 
in denver bush said our mission to malta was about peace 
not the kind of uneasy peace weve known for the last 40 years 
hard and cold but about the new kind of peace we aspire to one 
that is rich with the promise of permanence 
he spoke of his hopes for a new americansoviet relationship 
we took our first step toward the next decade and the new world 
that is taking shape a new world of security and freedom 
bush also issued a written statement noting the earthquake that 
devastated soviet armenia a year ago thursday 
recalling the assistance provided by us government and private 
groups and the soviet offer of help after this years san 
franciscoarea quake bush said as we look to a new era in 
ussoviet relations we can take hope from these examples of 
humanitarian cooperation between our two countries

students who met with president bush on friday say 
the president could be doing more in his war on drugs some of them 
also disagreed with his stands on abortion and women 
but they were all impressed that the president took time to sit 
down with them and listen to what they had to say 
anna valdez said she asked bush about abortion and accused the 
administration of cutting back social programs she said the bush 
administration should be doing more to provide child care 
valdez said bush favored the right of parents to choose child 
care but did not favor a government program 
i dont see the logic of his policy at all said the john f 
kennedy high school senior if hes prolife then he should 
support head start and other programs for children who already 
exist 
bush on a threestate twoday trip in which he was mixing 
antidrug speeches with republican fundraising met privately with 
a group of about two dozen students 
alex kennaugh a junior said he asked the president what he 
would do if he were leading the drug war in colombia and the 
president responded that he would try to halt the export of drugs 
kennaugh said he agreed but thought the administration could do 
more to educate young people about drug dangers 
hector sanchez said he told bush that the administration is 
focusing on drugs such as cocaine crack and a new cocaine 
derivative called ice but is getting away from fighting one of 
the most abused drugs at the school alcohol 
kids are being killed because of alcohol sanchez said 
sanchez said bush denied overlooking alcohol and told him the 
administration is doing what it can 
bush later left denver for des moines where about 20 
schoolchildren stood out in cold in the mid20s friday night to 
watch the arrival of air force one 
the pupils from andrew jackson elementary school said they found 
their glimpse of bush neat fun and interesting 
bush was in iowa for a radio discussion with farmers and a

the administrations goal of eliminating 
worldwide agricultural subsidies is an utopian vision that 
cant be achieved soon president bush said friday night 
the presidents comments came in a radio interview in the heart 
of the corn belt during a brief campaign stop on behalf of rep tom 
tauke the iowa republican who is attempting to unseat democratic 
sen tom harkin in 1990 
a policy seeking to remove barriers to sales of us farm 
products abroad set by the reagan administration and continued by 
bush seeks the elimination of all tradedistorting practices such 
as quotas and export subsidies 
its a good thing to have but i dont see that happening all 
at once bush said in an interview at who a station where reagan 
once was a sportscaster 
critics have said free trade in farm products would eliminate 
safety nets that ensure farming will remain profitable enough to 
assure a stable and safe food supply and would open the possibility 
of a flood of foreign meats and grains into us markets 
others have argued that practices such as importlimiting quotas 
raise prices to consumers and that export subsidies such as those 
the united states and european countries employ on a variety of 
products stifle farm development in the poor countries of the 
third world 
subsidy defenders have argued that the united states cannot do 
without them as long as competitors use them 
i still believe an iowa farmer can compete with anybody in the 
world provided they dont tie one hand behind his back and then 
tell him to fight bush said at one point 
the presidents trade representative carla hills has sought to 
make similar points saying this summer for instance us 
negotiators in the farm trade talks of the general agreement on 
tarriffs and trade would not unilaterally disarm american 
producers by giving up the questioned practices without getting 
something in return 
two democratic members of congress later said on the same 
station they were pleased to hear that the president does not 
expect all trade barriers to fall at once 
harkin said he underlined his notes when bush called the 
elimination of government subsidies utopian 
boy am i glad to hear him say that harkin said 
rep dan glickman dkan said by telephone the way the 
world is set up well probably never reach the utopian view that 
all nations will lower their subsidies 
questioned by bob quinn the stations news and farm information 
director about prospects for expanding markets for us 
commodities in eastern europe bush said those countries first need 
to reform their economies before they will be in any shape to 
increase purchases from the west 
while he said that too would take time i dont see anything 
other than continued increased exports for american agricultural 
products for a long time 
bush said while the questions focused on eastern europe i 
still want to see us make progress in terms of knocking down the 
barriers with western europe and were trying 
the soviet union already is a large purchaser of us grains 
using export subsidies

examination as unlikely to harm his exwife burst into her house 
early friday and killed her their two daughters and her new 
husband before killing himself 
neighbors identified the man who left a note telling his 
parents he was sorry for what he had to do as ronald richard 
burris 46 
the others all shot to death included his exwife shirley mae 
woody 41 the couples daughters vicki marie burris 14 and anne 
marie burris 6 and shirley woodys husband robert james woody 
31 
it was one of three murdersuicides reported around the nation 
on friday in which 12 people died 
in belleville ill a man identified as 48yearold kurt 
steibel shot and killed his wife daughter and 1yearold grandson 
then shot at firefighters before committing suicide by reentering 
his burning home authorities said 
after firefighters recovered steibels body they found the 
bodies of his wife carolyn and his daughter cindy townley whose 
ages were unavailable and his grandson eric townley xrays 
showed that they had been shot to death police said they hadnt 
determined a motive 
in buxton nd authorities said farmer wayne nygaard 42 
apparently shot his wife carol 40 and their 11yearold 
daughter kate before turning the gun on himself the bodies were 
found by the couples 17yearold son authorities did not cite a 
motive 
in the washington state case authorities said burris was armed 
with a handgun and a shotgun 
we have seasoned firefighters who were disturbed at what they 
found fire district capt bruce carpenter said of the scene 
we dont know for sure why he did it except here you have an 
exhusband and a divorce that wasnt the nicest in the world 
curt benson spokesman for the pierce county sheriffs department 
said as he stood on the rainswept treelined street outside the 
home 
divorce and child custody and support records along with a 1988 
court order barring burris from contact with his exfamily show a 
19year marriage that broke up in 1987 after shirley burris accused 
her husband of sexually molesting their daughters 
the accusation investigated by state child protective workers 
did not result in criminal charges against burris according to 
records on file at the peirce county clerks office in nearby 
tacoma 
burris who was a civilian logistics supply official at nearby 
mcchord air force base denied the allegations in the divorce and 
custody papers calling them a wilfull and malevolent charge 
his exwife later called him so antimother that the girls 
resent it that comment was made in a sworn statement used to 
uphold a february 1988 restraining order barring burris from 
contact with his daughters and living within two miles of his 
exwifes home 
a psychological examination in september 1988 found that if 
burris was seriously inclined to do her harm he would already 
have done so according to custody dispute records burris 
submitted to the exam as a condition for getting the restraint 
order lifted 
benson said burris awoke his victims when he smashed through a 
sliding glass door at the rear of the house and shot woody in the 
couples bedroom as he called sheriffs deputies to report the 
breakin 
when deputies arrived minutes later at about 512 am pst 
they found burris body in the living room where he had committed 
suicide benson said 
we then went into the master bedroom we found a husband and 
wife on the floor both died of apparent gunshot wounds 
anne 6 was found dead in her bedroom and a 14yearold vicki 
was shot in the doorway to her room he said 
principals at the schools the girls attended said they had told 
their pupils of the deaths and brought in psychologists to counsel 
the children

cuban president fidel castro rallied 
communists around the world to defend socialism against the east 
bloc reforms which he said could only hurt cubas economy an 
official cuban report said friday 
he said capitalism was gaining unusual strength in socialist 
countries but rejected it as a means of solving cubas problems he 
said it would mean a loss of sovereignty and independence 
declaring we would be an extension of miami 
some eastern european countries have teams of americans 
programming their capitalist development castro said in his speech 
late thursday 
castro spoke for nearly an hour at funeral services for more 
than 2000 cubans killed abroad over the past 14 years most of 
them in africa the cuban government news agency prensa latina said 
in a dispatch monitored in mexico 
if destiny assigns cuba the role of being one of the last to 
defend socialism it will do it down to the last drop of its 
blood prensa latina quoted castro as saying 
he said his speech was directed to those who think we will not 
be able to resist the changes that are occurring in europe 
we can only expect negative consequences for the economy of 
the country from the changes he said he did not elaborate 
the cuban president contrasted cubas socialism with that of 
eastern europe saying socialism did not arrive here through the 
victorious divisions of the red army but was forged with the 
heroism of the cubans 
prensa latina said he described as repugnant articles in the 
soviet press criticizing the soviet system cuban authorities did 
not hesitate in blocking circulation of the publications he said 
castro spoke after cubans lined up for hours for a silent 
procession past the coffins of soldiers and civilian technicians 
killed in angola ethiopia and other african conflicts

the hispanic community launched a drive friday to 
raise money on behalf of a colombianborn policeman convicted of 
killing two black men while religious leaders declared a weekend 
of prayer to unify the races 
black leaders have hailed the manslaughter conviction of miami 
officer william lozano 31 as a victory for justice but many 
hispanics particularly those in the 200000strong colombian 
community say the officer was a scapegoat to racial politics the 
deaths of the two black men touched off three days of rioting in 
january 
colombianoriented radio stations wocnam and wkatam have 
organized drives to help the officer and his family lozanos 
tearful mother went on the air friday morning to ask for help in 
paying legal expenses for his appeal 
my son to everyone who has always known him wouldnt hurt or 
kill anyone without reason she pleaded we need money 
lozano himself took to the airwaves on spanishlanguage 
television friday evening saying he was a symbol for police 
officers around the country 
its now my duty as a police officer in the situation that im 
in to protect the civil rights of all policemen who are patrolling 
the streets he said adding that he was publicly fighting his 
conviction so that they can enforce the law the way they should 
be able to 
wocn scheduled a radiothon and rally at noon saturday to raise 
funds and seek signatures on a petition asking circuit judge joseph 
farina to show leniency when he sentences lozano on jan 24 lozano 
and his family are expected to participate in the broadcast said 
afternoon news coordinator fernando escobar 
to help heal the wounds between blacks and hispanics a group of 
jewish protestant and lay religious leaders held a joint news 
conference declaring a weekend of prayer for the families of lozano 
and the shooting victims clement lloyd and allan blanchard 
i think the worst thing we can do as a community is to sit 
back smugly and say we came through this time without fires and 
riots said rabbi solomon schiff chairman of dade countys 
community relations board 
he also called for new economic programs including asking 
businesses to hire blacks in proportion to their numbers in the 
community 
the rev vane eubanks a black minister and president of people 
united to lead the struggle for equality said impromptu 
celebrations after thursdays verdict celebrated a victory for 
justice not the conviction of lozano 
we are not a bloodthirsty lynch mob out to get someone 
eubanks said adding even an acquittal would not have caused a riot 
because the black community could see the trial was conducted 
fairly 
roman catholic officials who represent a largely hispanic 
following did not attend the news conference however mary ross 
augusta a spokeswoman for the roman catholic archdiocese of miami 
said church officials had been in contact with the community 
relations board and parish priests intended to speak out on the 
issue of racial unity this weekend 
remarks by some hispanic leaders however suggest they will not 
be easily appeased 
we are deeply hurt said hernando torres executive 
secretary of the colombian american political action committee 
we are convinced that officer lozano was doing his duty defending 
the community 
although colombians have led the drive to support lozano many 
in the larger cubanamerican community see the verdict as a blow to 
all hispanics 
mr lozano being latin was sacrificed to appease a segment 
of the community to prevent riots and burning said david duenas 
sr a retiree who said he closely followed the trial 
others supported the outcome saying the trial was fair 
the hispanic community is mature said jorge 
hernandeztorrano president of the cuban american bar association 
its immediate reaction sympathy for lozano is natural but 
that will pass 
many police officers especially hispanics say they are 
dismayed by the verdict but will not give their names for fear of 
retaliation by police officials 
one said he would be reluctant to enter a threatening situation 
as lozano did when he stepped into the street and fired a shot at 
the motorcycle lloyd and blanchard were riding 
i might have to do something and i might wind up where 
lozano was today said the officer 
but police spokesman david rivero said many officers were 
reacting in the heat of the moment 
any time youre faced with something like that at first 
youre going to be emotional but after a while things get to 
normal rivero said 
since the jan 16 shooting which touched off three days of 
racial violence lozano has been relieved of duty with pay 
following his conviction an administrative hearing was initiated 
on possible dismissal but no decision was expected this week the 
department said

a hunter who was spared criminal 
prosecution when a grand jury refused to indict him in the 1988 
shooting death of a woman near her house was indicted for 
manslaughter friday by another grand jury 
donald rogerson was charged in the death of karen wood a 
37yearold mother of young twins who was shot in woods behind her 
house in hermon a bangor suburb on nov 15 1988 the case has 
stirred strong emotions among hunters and nonhunters alike in a 
state known as a hunting haven 
rogerson a supermarket produce manager and an experienced 
hunter has said he believed he was firing at a deer mrs wood 
died of a single gunshot wound to the chest 
rogerson 46 faces up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted on 
the charge of manslaughter said assistant attorney general jeffrey 
hjelm who is prosecuting the case there is no minimum sentence 
hjelm said 
no arraignment date was immediately set 
chief deputy attorney general james t kilbreth explaining why 
the state took the case before a second grand jury cited news 
stories that raised questions about the fairness of the decision by 
the first grand jury 
kilbreth acknowledged for the first time friday that the most 
important aspect of the decision to reopen the case was the 
discovery that a nephew of lewis v vafiades rogersons attorney 
in the case had served on the first grand jury 
however he said there was only the appearance of a conflict and 
an investigation by his office had turned up no evidence of any 
wrongdoing the nephew vasor vafiades has been quoted in news 
reports as saying he did not take part in the case 
rogerson had initially been charged with manslaughter but the 
first grand jury refused to indict him finding he had not been 
criminally negligent or criminally reckless and the charge was 
dropped 
vafiades described rogerson as disappointed obviously at 
fridays grand jury action in superior court in penobscot county 
site of the first grand jury hearing 
mrs woods husband kevin who has moved to iowa with his two 
daughters said he was encouraged by the indictment and that grand 
jurors who voted to indict had reached the only decision logic 
and reason would allow 
wood who settled a wrongful death lawsuit against rogerson in 
may for 122000 said the case should be viewed the same as any 
other criminal proceeding not as a case that pits hunters against 
nonhunters 
state law prohibits hunting within 300 feet of a residence game 
wardens found that at the time of the shooting rogerson was 306 
feet from the woods house and 286 feet from a neighbors house

president bush said friday he hopes to attend an 
antidrug summit in colombia in february despite violence there and 
he vowed to send a message to those merchants of death who 
traffic in narcotics 
bush commented after his drug policy director william bennett 
said recent bombings in colombia have raised new concerns about 
safety at the meeting site 
you have to be concerned with everybodys safety in colombia 
these days its really very very rough bennett told reporters 
aboard air force one as he accompanied bush on a threestate 
twoday trip in which the president was mixing antidrug speeches 
with republican fundraising 
violence in colombia could delay the summit or even bring about 
a new location for it but the burden of proof is still on those 
who would argue that you shouldnt go bennett said 
and bennett said later i think hell go there 
some white house advisers and several key members of congress 
have urged that a new site be found for the summit but bush when 
asked by reporters if he was still determined to go to colombia 
replied id like to 
the president addressing students at john f kennedy high 
school said his support for colombian president virgilio barco was 
unwavering 
barco has decided i dont care how much it costs i dont 
care about the threat im going to do something bush said 
and he declared it was vital that the united states stand behind 
barco and do what we can to support him in his effort 
bush lashed out at thugs who plant a bomb outside an office 
building referring to the explosion earlier this week in bogota 
that killed 52 people 
and he told an assembly at the school it was important that 
there be united action to drive drug traffickers out of business 
let us send a message to those merchants of death we are 
going to defeat you he said 
the president was in denver for the high school antidrug rally 
with members of the denver broncos football team he also attended 
a fundraiser for republican rep hank brown who is seeking the 
senate seat being vacated by republican william armstrong 
several dozen demonstrators many carrying signs protesting us 
policy in el salvador were outside both denver events 
bush told his gop audience that his summit last weekend with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was a first hopeful step 
into a new americansoviet relationship 
our mission to malta was about peace the president said 
not the kind of uneasy peace weve known for the last 40 years 
hard and cold but about a new kind of peace one that is rich 
with the promise of permanence 
he spoke of new beginnings as democracy blooms behind what 
used to be called the iron curtain 
later bush stopped in des moines iowa on his way back to 
washington to appear at a fundraising dinner for senate hopeful 
rep tom tauke his third such appearance in two days 
four men and two women were arrested for trying to disrup the 
speech as about 300 people marched outside the hall to protest us 
policies in central america im trying to tell the government of 
america to get out of el salvador one of the two women shouted 
as she was dragged away by police 
bush also told a local radio station who that while he would 
work to end tradedistorting government farm subsidies worldwide 
we cant unilaterally get rid of them while were being kept out 
of certain markets 
in a live interview bush called an elimination of all farm 
subsidies which former president reagan had proposed by the year 
2000 a utopian vision 
a snowstorm in the east made bush cancel plans to spend the 
weekend at the presidential retreat in camp david md in favor of 
returning to the white house 
in washington meanwhile a pentagon official said friday that 
some soviet military forces in east germany have raised their alert 
status but the action apparently is only to protect their bases 
and nuclear weapons 
its a selfprotection measure said the official who spoke 
on condition he not be named 
in light of the political turmoil in east germany he said 
they have taken increased security measures but it is similar to 
something we might do at our bases if there are problems nearby 
they havent moved their troops forward and they arent 
preparing for battle 
as for the drug summit in colombia bennett was asked why bush 
wanted to go to violencetorn colombia 
barco is brave and courageous george bush is brave and 
courageous george bush just admires the hell out of barco you 
could see that in a meeting we had in the white house bennett 
said 
i know that if barco says its important for the president to 
be there the presidents going to do it unless it doesnt make 
sense 
i havent seen any hesitation on the presidents part 
bennett said but he added one of the things you have to 
consider is not just the security of the president but the 
security of a whole lot of people who go where the president goes 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that the white 
house is not having second thoughts about colombia but as bill 
says we continue to evaluate the situation 
at the moment we think security could be provided and there 
are still tentative plans to go we keep evaluating the situation 
the secret service believes they can provide security for the 
president 
the summit is an attempt to focus international attention on 
drug trafficking problems in colombia peru and bolivia 
bennett said that colombias battle against drug lords has 
obviously gotten to them and theyre fighting back very hard 
bush was wrapping up a twoday visit to texas colorado and 
iowa combining stops for 1990 republican senate candidates with 
antidrug appearances

east germanys embattled communists on 
saturday proposed for the post of party chairman a 41yearold 
reformist lawyer who has worked for the opposition a party 
spokeswoman said 
spokeswoman brigitte zimmermann said the lawyer gregor gysi 
was the only candidate for the post 
she said in briefing reporters on a closeddoor session of the 
emergency congress that delegates were also choosing a 100member 
party board that will constitute its next leadership serving under 
a chairman 
that meant the party had abolished its traditional hierarchy of 
a general secretary a politburo and the policymaking central 
committee the structure was a holdover from the stalinist era 
ms zimmermann said the 2753 delegates decided unanimously not 
to dissolve the party but also decided by a more than a 31 margin 
to change its name from the socialist unity party of germany to a 
new name yet to be chosen 
the communists have lost much of their control over society in 
recent weeks and have granted historic concessions to the 
opposition including opening the berlin wall and other borders in 
a desperate effort to shed their stalinist legacy and remain in 
power 
mass demonstrations throughout east german demanded reforms 
greater freedom and the prosecution of corrupt former officials 
tens of thousands of east germans fled earlier this year to west 
germany 
gysi has spoken out for broad political and economic reforms and 
has acted as lawyer for the opposition group new forum he belonged 
to the interim party leadership and heads a committee investigating 
corruption allegations against the ousted leadership 
in an earlier address to the congress gysi said the capitalist 
system in western societies was not something one cannot learn 
from he said it was limited by transnational concerns the 
international militaryindustrial complex 
gysi said the crisis here could only be solved if east germany 
found a third way beyond stalinist socialism and the power of 
transnational monopolies 
he called for a free competition in east german society he 
declared we need a full break with the failed stalinism which 
he blamed for the countrys political and economic crisis 
earlier the congress went behind closed doors after a fivehour 
debate failed to produce agreement on the course of the emergency 
session 
many delegates insisted on continuing a debate to explore abuses 
of the past but others insisted that the party first needs new 
leadership 
the deep differences reflected the rifts in the party ms 
zimmermann said membership had dropped from 23 million to less 
than 18 million in recent months 
party sources said premier hans modrow also presented a report 
on the work of the nowousted communist party central committee 
which quit in disgrace on sunday 
the historic congress held in an east berlin sports hall began 
by debating the partys proposed program that calls for free 
elections and broad cooperation with opposition groups 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
czechoslovakias communist leaders offered to surrender their 
control over the government for the first time in 41 years and 
accept a minority role in a coalition cabinet 
bulgarian communists ousted six members of the ruling party 
politburo and 20 members of the policymaking central committee 
including former hardline party chief todor zhivkov 
the soviet communist partys central committee planned an 
extraordinary meeting saturday to set the agenda for the soviet 
unions parliament next week 
the east german communists moved the emergency congress ahead 
one week worried that their slipping control of national affairs 
was contributing to an atmosphere of instability the congress 
shown live on national tv could continue through sunday 
modrow gave the keynote speech and echoed calls for communist 
party unity 
let us not allow the party to be broken to go under but 
lets make it clean and strong he said to applause 
we too are the people modrow said referring to the 
slogan widely used by prodemocracy demonstrators 
modrow one of the few communists with broad popularity also 
ruled out reunification of the two germanys 
reunification is not on the agenda he said as the delegates 
broke into long applause 
the german state was divided into communist east germany and 
capitalist prowestern west germany after the defeat of adolf 
hitlers nazi regime in world war ii 
herbert kroker chairman of the partys 25member interim 
leadership committee told delegates they were dealing not only 
with the fate of the party but also with the fate of east germany 
if the party split kroker said we would also destroy the 
hope for a free and cohesive society that we and the others want 
the socialist unity party as the communists are officially 
known was created in 1946 through the forced merger of the german 
communist party and the social democrats 
party leader walter ulbrich ruled until 1971 when he was 
replaced by erich honecker 
as hundreds of thousands of east germans began taking to the 
streets in october to demand free elections and other democratic 
reforms the hardline honecker was forced to resign on oct 18 
he was replaced by egon krenz who opened the berlin wall and 
gave the east germans the freedom to travel they had not enjoyed 
since the wall was built in 1961 
krenz also made promises of free elections and other reforms 
but his longtime association with the corruptionwracked honecker 
regime forced him to step down on sunday just six weeks after 
taking office 
the ruling politburo and the entire 163member policymaking 
central committee also resigned in an unprecedented move the 
leadership was replaced by the 25member panel of reformers who 
drew up the partys new program 
honecker and 11 other former highranking officials have been 
expelled from the party honecker 77 is under criminal 
prosecution and seven former politburo members have been 
imprisoned on corruption charges

the number of older people is growing but 
benefits for the elderly may be heading in the opposite direction 
it is a situation with explosive potential 
in some respects the position of the elderly today is in sharp 
contrast to that of just a few years ago when some studies warned 
against inordinate gray power or the success of the elderly in 
lobbying congress for greater benefits 
in recent years private pension plans have attempted to cut 
health benefits to the elderly and the government began taxing 
social security payments sharp increases in home equity source of 
security for the elderly have been muted 
e against them restraints on inflation have been 
a plus for those on fixed incomes should hig not all has gonhlevel inflation 
reappear social security beneficiaries have some protection 
through escalation clauses 
but the big issues arent easily resolved rising healthcare 
costs are endangering corporate benefits plans attempts to make 
life easier for the elderly run headlong into whether it is fair to 
tax youth for the cost 
particular problems apply to the handling of social security 
which many critics say is working on outdated assumptions 
james ivers fits 
beyond those dollar limits beneficiaries lose 50 cents on the 
dollar 
for a married workerbeneficiary not selfemployed says ivers 
it means the loss of 50 cents because of the income cutoff another 
15 cents to income tax and another 75 cents to social security 
taxes leaving just 275 cents 
next year the maximum that beneficiaries can earn will go up to 
9360 with benefits reduced by 1 for every 3 earned beyond the 
limit but that still amounts to a 33 percent tax often on 
relatively low wages 
ivers who teaches chartered financial consultants at the 
college which is based in bryn mawr pa says informed estimates 
exist that as many as 1 million working recipients now lose some 
benefits because they incur penalties 
he estimates that another 100000 between ages 65 and 70 do not 
file for any social security benefits because they choose to 
continue working full time preliminary work has begun in congress 
to relax the restrictions against income but no bill is 
anticipated soon still there appears to be strong sentiment among 
some house members to get rid of all income restrictions 
while the elderly did benefit from a falling income tax rate in 
the 1980s they lost benefits too among them the extra exemption 
that those 65 years or older had been receiving and the freedom 
from taxes on benefits 
basically if a married recipient has an adjusted gross income 
of more than 32000 that recipient pays tax on half the benefits 
says ivers he observes that 32000 can include earnings on 
otherwise taxexempt bonds 
additionally says ivers ive always wondered why social 
security is taxed twice first when a person pays the system and 
again when they receive the benefits 
as the law stands he continues there are more inconsistencies 
he asks for example why a person who chooses to work and make 
payments into the system until 70 years of age shouldnt receive 
benefits for the extra payments 
he wonders why those who were disciplined enough to save money 
for their retirement should be penalized perhaps because their 
investment income pushed them beyond the limits 
whatever the laws are he said all older people should be 
treated equally with each other

not many bestselling authors will make this 
claim ive written eight books and read two 
but then not many authors are 93yearold comedians such as 
george burns 
hes back on the bestseller list with all my best friends 
putnams 1795 a reminiscence of his show business pals burns 
readily admits that he talks the books to david fisher who 
does the writing his own acquaintance with literature ended in the 
fourth grade 
i went into show business when i was eight years old he 
explained i never went to school my teacher was miss oliver 
and she came to my house my mother knocked on my door and said 
miss oliver would like to see you my mother slammed the front 
door and hollered up to me miss oliver is gone i came out and 
miss oliver was still sitting there 
my school was show business said burns i wish i had a 
better education but i know all about show business i love what i 
do here i am 93 years old sitting in my office theyre taking 
my picture im being interviewed its nice to get up and have 
something to do at 93 because i cant make any money in bed 
burns was reflecting in the studio office that seems to have 
changed little in three decades 
nor has george the raspy wisecracks come with finetuned timing 
between sips of tea and drags on the omnipresent cigar he was 
asked to reflect on the figures he talks about in all my best 
friends most of them onetime residents of the fabled comedians 
round table at hillcrest country club 
eddie cantor he was a very talented man but he didnt 
leave you with much cantor mostly had vitality once cantor and 
george jessel were playing the palace cantor said something and 
jessel topped him cantor took off his shoe and hit jessel over the 
head and got a big laugh 
jessel resented that he went down to the footlights and took 
cantor apart in front of the audience he said something and i 
topped him he couldnt think of an answer so he hit me on the head 
with his shoe im not working with a talent im working with an 
idiot when he got through cantor hit him again with his shoe and 
got the biggest laugh 
jimmy durante a kind nice religious man and everybody 
loved him he was a great talent who took the english language 
apart i didnt know him but i used to watch durante when he had a 
little band he was funny then i dont think there was any 
mrs calabash i think he made that up he said it once and the 
audience ate it up 
the audience is the answer to everything if the audience 
laughs it stays in if the audience doesnt laugh not only does 
the joke not stay in you dont even stay in the theater 
bob hope hes not a comedian hes an institution i just 
worked with bob hope at madison square garden hes a wonderful 
man a nice man good comedian very topical everything i say fits 
my age i dont say anything that doesnt fit a 93yearold man or 
a 93yearold face 
milton berle hes one of the kids but hell make it in 
show business he was very lucky and so was i all the fellas im 
talking about had places to be bad 
his mother took care of him in the early days she was always 
in the theater and she knew when to laugh and when to applaud one 
day she was in the audience and a man started playing with her 
knee she laughed in the right spots she applauded 
when milton got through she turned around and slapped the man 
in the face she wouldnt interrupt the act 
walter matthau i did the sunshine boys with walter 
matthau i was very lucky to get that movie i won an academy 
award when walter didnt like the way i read a line hed hit me 
he slapped my face five or six times during the picture 
al jolson ill tell you how great he was there was a 
jewish guy son of a cantor hed blacken up get down on one knee 
and sing i got a mammy in alabammy and the audience believed 
him they believed jolson had a mammy in alabammy 
sammy davis jr he may be the biggest talent in show 
business not the biggest entertainer that was jolson but sammy 
has the whole thing he dances hes a mimic hes an actor hes

while displays documenting most of 
romanias 2000 years of history are crammed into the bottom floor 
of the national history museum the top story deals with only the 
past 24 years the era of nicolae ceausescu 
much of the three hours of state television programming 
available nightly is dedicated to singing the praises of the 
supreme leader his wife elena also receives her share of 
adulation 
the staterun newspapers the only ones sold often dedicate 
more than twothirds of their contents to the couple what they are 
doing on a particular day ceausescus thoughts or his importance 
to the country 
posters of ceausescu depicting him decades younger than his 71 
years decorate offices cultural institutions and shop windows 
while book stores give prominent displays to works by and about the 
leader and his 70yearold wife 
at a time when democratic upheaval is sweeping away the last 
vestiges of stalinism in most other parts of the east bloc a look 
at todays romania and the personality cult surrounding the 
ceausescus is like stepping back to the early 1950s the communist 
party maintains total control and controlling the party is one man 
the cult around ceausescu who assumed control in 1965 is 
unequalled except in north korea where kim il sung the 
77yearold great leader receives orchestrated public homage 
of near religious character 
efforts to show ceausescu in a prominent light even lead 
authorities to retouch photographs 
a photo in some newspapers of ceausescu visiting a shipyard in 
the black sea port of constanta earlier this year showed politburo 
member emil bobu in conversation with someone behind ceausescu as 
the president pointed to a mockup architectural project 
for his irreverence not paying attention to ceausescu bobu 
was airbrushed out of later published versions of the same picture 
the communist partys 14th congress in november also served as a 
showcase of orchestrated displays of affection for ceausescu 
day after day delegates rose to applaud and shout slogans 
ceauescu heroism romania communism as the president spoke 
they were silenced by an imperious wave of his hand 
the suppression of dissent or complaints over years of food and 
energy shortages by a powerful secret police has created an 
atmosphere of fear while most ordinarly romanians are unwilling to 
risk trouble by talking bluntly to westerners about the country and 
its leader some do take the risk 
i hope that when you come back one told a departing 
westerner well be all dancing at the funeral his wink left 
little doubt whose funeral he was talking about 
a joke going around bucharest has the same theme 
a man asks a friend why he is reading the front page of 
scinteia the communist party newspaper so intently when everyone 
knows that the paper publishes little real news 
i am looking for the obituaries the friend replies 
but theyre on a inside page 
not the one im looking for 
theres no trace anything like that in the 10 rooms of ceausescu 
memorabilia on the top floor of the natural history museum a 
chilly and dark 19thcentury building on calea victoria 
few people were inside one recent day several shabbily dressed 
attendants stood by lukewarm radiators or turned lights on and off 
as three westerners moved from room to room 
displays alternated by theme or country but all had the 
ceausescus as a focal point 
a gigantic illuminated tableau showed ceausescu and his wife 
with foreign dignitaries including presidents nixon ford and 
carter no soviet leaders were in it a reflection of longstanding 
strains with the kremlin 
scores of paintings carpets or tapestries depicted ceausescu or 
his wife in a variety of heroic poses ceausescu holding a scepter 
with the romanian tricolor swathed across his chest for example 
or his wife with an aura around her head suggestive of a halo 
other rooms had massive granite or marble busts of the 
ceausescus along with expensive vases pottery crystal a bull 
elephants head with massive tusks and other objects described in a 
museum brochure as gifts 
in display cases were medals on velvet pillows including 
britains order of the garter bestowed by queen elizabeth ii in the 
1970s when western nations praised ceausescus relative 
indepedendence of moscow and ignored his countrys poor human 
rights record 
the medals and orders were bestowed on him as a sign of 
our peoples love and gratitude for its most loved son and the 
romanian presidents deep respect and highest regard he enjoys all 
over the world said the brochure 
in a prominent place was a certificate attesting that mrs 
ceausescu was an honorary citizen of texas along with one 
bestowing the same honors on her husband from civic officials of 
fresno calif

before the palo verde nuclear plant was licensed 
in 1985 the us nuclear industry built 92 reactors each one 
different and needing to go through the detailed timeconsuming 
and costly scrutiny of regulators 
palo verde was the first of what was hoped would be a 
standardized design that utilities could in effect order from a 
catalog that cookie cutter approach is used by the french and 
japanese nuclear industries 
palo verde still is a stateoftheart facility said nrc 
regional spokesman gregory n cook the plant was built by people 
who did a superb job but management did not convert the 
organization to the kind of staff the kind of organization you 
need to operate a nuclear plant in todays environment 
as a result the 93 billion plant has been plagued by problems 
that earned it a ranking as the nations 19th worst and worst in 
terms of management from public citizen a watchdog group in 
addition the nuclear regulatory commission has fined the arizona 
nuclear power project 810000 since 1983 for deficiencies in the 
plant anpp operates and sent a special diagnostic team last month 
and an industry accreditation board put nine out of 10 training 
programs on probation in june 
palo verde 1 has fallen to the bottom of the industry joan 
claybrook president of the critical mass energy project of public 
citizen a ralph naderfounded group said in may its time they 
closed that nuclear lemon down 
problems have shut down the three reactors almost as often as 
theyve been running and two units have been down since early 
march forcing the consortium of utilities that own it to buy power 
elsewhere during a recordlength heat wave to serve their 4 million 
customers in four states 
the mentality of building and the mentality of operating are 
two totally distinctive things william f conway who was lured 
away from florida power and light co in may to oversee palo verde 
said in june it is almost like reading two different prayer 
books operations is another type of religion 
according to arizona corporation commission records unit 1 was 
in operation 62 percent of the time in 1986 49 percent in 1987 62 
percent in 1988 and 22 percent in 1989 not at all since early in 
march unit 2 which came on line in late 1986 was producing power 
77 percent of the time in 1987 63 percent in 1988 and less than 
half of 1989 unit 3 the newest reactor was up for 95 percent of 
1988 producing more power than any unit in the world but it has 
been on line only 16 percent of 1989 not at all since early march 
the 1270megawatt pressurizedwater plants units have missed 
a total of 639 days of operation this year scheduled refueling and 
various mechanical problems have kept units 1 and 3 down since 
early march and unit 2 has been up and down since february 
the nrc fines include 250000 in september for 13 alleged 
violations discovered after unit 3 shut itself down in march so 
many things went wrong during the automatic shutdown the nrc 
ordered a special inspection 
the shutdown occurred because of a powerline failure ensuing 
problems included loss of power to two primary coolant pumps 
failure of a fasttransfer system relief valves that froze and 
wouldnt release steam on the nonnuclear side of the plant and 
loss of some radiation monitors and emergency lights 
the nrc said in april that equipment failures leading to the 
shutdown could have been avoided if problems were fixed when they 
were found some as long as four years ago this event is 
symptomatic of managements failure to set a standard which demands 
that plant problems be recognized and fixed 
the agency also has complained that top managers didnt visit 
critical areas often enough a problem that is being addressed 
cook said they have developed a formal program of getting 
management on site and into the plant but as of a couple of months 
ago the plan hadnt been fully implemented we were a little 
disappointed that it hadnt gotten farther along 
evaluations like the one begun last month he said are 
conducted when nrc senior management has substantial questions 
about the overall management of the operation we are looking 
toward performance what works and what doesnt the teams 
report report is due in about march 
other fines were 250000 in december 1988 over operation and 
radiation 100000 in april 1988 over engineering and operation 
100000 in may 1986 for security problems 50000 in october 1985 
for deficiencies in monitoring and 60000 in 1983 for lapses in 
quality assurance and recordkeeping thats a fairly poor 
enforcement record and very high fines cook said 
the criteria for public citizens ratings included such things 
as forced shutdowns worker exposure to radiation violation of nrc 
regulations cost of maintenance and scores on annual nrc 
assessments 
conway has set in motion a plan for immediate improvements at 
palo verde said plant spokesman don andrews he brought in new 
people to raise the level of management experience began improving 
accident investigation issued a set of standards and 
expectations for all employees and moved to increase the sense 
of urgency in responding to problems uncovered by the nrc 
the national academy for nuclear training which cited lack of 
attendance among problems when it put plant programs on probation 
restored accreditation in october only radiation protection 
training had been deemed adequate 
the nrc has been encouraged by what has happened since conway 
took over cook said you have to expect in dealing with an 
organization of that size where there have been institutional 
problems which certainly there have been it is going to take time 
to turn it around 
in its annual assessment nov 24 the nrc found overall 
performance to be satisfactory and directed toward safe 
facility operation performance slipped somewhat in the first six 
months of the reporting period ending oct 31 but showed 
improvement in the remaining six months the assessment said 
nrc regional administrator jm martin in a letter accompanying 
the report said he expected plant performance to continue 
improving if management implements planned improvements and 
corrections but he cited several areas of continued weakness 
such as engineering quality assurance and other 
problemfinding functions 
the sign of a healthy organization is that they find their own 
problems he said they dont wait for them to be 
selfrevealed or for them to be found by regulators what im 
particularly looking for is that theyre finding the bulk of their 
problems they arent doing that yet 
conway said the nrc report was right on target and that he 
is generally pleased with the progress at palo verde im 
relatively impatient by nature i would like for us to be moving 
faster he said but i am generally satisfied with where were 
going at this point in time

long before producers routinely scoured 
newspapers for tragedies suitable for bad tv movies there was a 
thing called imagination that once led to a a fine 1932 broadway 
play dinner at eight 
tonight ted turners tnt cable network is showing an elegant tv 
version of that comedydrama last made into a movie in 1933 by 
george s kaufman and edna ferber good writers who wrote a total 
of six plays together 
this dinner like the original remains a comedy and tragedy 
of manners a series of vignettes about various folks most rich or 
formerly rich coping with life while gearing up for a blacktie 
dinner at a manhattan townhouse 
with a fine cast that includes marsha mason as the hostess john 
mahoney as her husband and lauren bacall as his old flame this 
edition is very much updated with references to pee wee herman 
madonna pbs and arbitrage 
there also is a subplot about a hostile takeover of the ailing 
husbands failing shipping company that his family has owned since 
1873 
even the art of fashionable dining gets a contemporary line that 
is tossed at the society hostess a persistent giver of fashionable 
dinners you people are like mcdonalds for rich folks 
sad to say tom griffins teleplay is only half good that half 
is the shows first half there you hear echoes of kaufmans 
acerbic wit and thats welcome even though the sting of the humor 
tends to be softened by ron lagomarsinos direction 
alas the second half takes on a bleak humorless tone and 
dwells far too much on a cokedout alcoholic and overthehill tv 
star harry hamlin who is the secret lover of masons engaged 
daughter stacy edwards 
it may give a chance for hamlin from nbcs la law to 
strut his thespic stuff but it only tends to lower the show to the 
level of a routine tv drama about an actor suffering the twin 
horrors of cocaine addiction and no tv series 
and a fight between an oafish rapicious texas tycoon charles 
durning and his dense socialclimbing young wife ellen greene 
doesnt improve matters either its merely nasty nothing more 
all this makes the earlier fun take a powder just like hamlins 
faded star those who expect kaufmanlike wit in this part of 
dinner will feel like the guy who bought a pumpkin farm then 
learned halloween is canceled 
but let us count our blessing even though we may be no good at 
fractions 
the chief blessing is bacall who in her youth was directed on 
stage by kaufman she just about steals the shows good first half 
as a breezy sophisticated driedup novelist who is financially 
tapped out and reduced to talk shows to remain known but refuses 
to cry the blues 
when she blows into town and is asked by her old flame what tore 
her away from her old european haunts she just laughs haunts 
indeed everywhere you turn its robin leach and some anorexic 
bacall tosses off this and other lines beautifully with mahoney 
nicely underplaying things as her stillaffectionate former beau 
greene in a lowiq part similar to the one she played as a 
blonde in offbroadways little shop of horrors also does a 
nice turn early on as the lowborn lady who leaps at the chance to 
meet people with historic manners 
its too bad that the makers of this updated dinner didnt 
fully keep the spirit of its yesteryear taking serious things 
lightly and light things seriously 
but at least their effort gives you a few moments of wit and 
thanks to bacall a classy reminder of how they did it in the old 
days

the multibilliondollar savings and loan 
disaster is far from the only federal credit fiasco that has 
occurred in the past few years and more are likely to come 
according to a reagan administration official 
more bad news is on the way said ronald utt in an article 
written for todays roll call a privately owned newspaper 
circulated among members of congress and influential government 
officials 
utt now a fellow in political economy at the heritage 
foundation a conservative think tank suggests it is only the 
sheer size of the savings and loan bailout that draws attention 
from other debacles 
current estimates are that the cost of refinancing the savings 
and loan system will require 159 billion over 10 years but 
various critics have suggestd much higher figures 
the first of the series of other collapses involved the farm 
credit system whose lending practices helped create an 
unsustainable speculative boom in farm prices in the 1970s 
restructuring the system cost several billion dollars 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp went next at what 
utt claims will be an ultimate cost of hundreds of billions of 
dollars then the federal deposit insurance corp lost more than 4 
billion last year 
the latest was revealed in september when the general 
accounting office reported that the federal housing administration 
had lost 42 billion in 1988 wiping out its reserves to support 
303 billion of insurance in force 
utt former deputy director of the white house office of 
management and budget said additional losses should be expected 
because of the vast array of government lending programs insurance 
schemes and loan guarantees 
many of these programs suffer from high default rates minimal 
reserves lax management and persistent losses he said he cited 
the pension benefit guaranty corp which insures pensions of 39 
million privatesector workers 
to date he said the pbgc has suffered cumulative losses 
amounting to 4 billion a figure he said could go higher 
he observes that while the pbgc collects premiums holds 
reserves and obligates itself to cover failed systems it has no 
measure of the extent of liability for the trillions of dollars of 
systems it has agreed to insure 
moreover he continues a recent inspector general report 
accused the corporation of a variety of aministrative and 
supervisory failings that jepoardize the fund the taxpaper and 
the pensioners 
utt claims governmentsponsored enterprises privately owned 
lending institutions created by government to pursue public 
purposes collectively expose the government to about 700 billion 
in risk 
he said some of these enterprises already are in trouble one 
the federal national mortgage association has a little more than 
1 billion to support a mortgage portfolio of 95 billion and 140 
billion in mortgagebacked paper 
if fnma were subject to the standards of solvency required of 
a savings and loan it would have been taken over by federal 
regulators years ago he said 
utt expressed the view that other taxpayer bailouts of unknown 
magnitude perhaps involving the federal housing administration and 
the veterans administration might occur if property values fall 
and default rates rise

americanborn australian johnny diesel may 
prefer vegimite to peanut butter but his brand of rock n roll 
sounds like it comes fresh from the us heartland not the aussie 
bushland 
the roots of our music are the 50s and 60s what was 
happening in rock n roll rampb and motown diesel said in a 
recent telephone interview from australia its a huge 
influence 
refreshingly lowtech johnny diesel amp the injectors mix good 
ol american rock and blues with forceful guitar attacks honed in 
the geographic isolation of perth in western australia 
musically mature beyond his 23 years diesel pleads guilty to 
fanning embers of the american rock n roll fireball blown 
worldwide three decades ago were bound to sound american 
because thats where the blues began he said 
the band cut their wellreceived debut album johnny diesel amp 
the injectors chrysalis at an unknown studio in memphis 
tenn not melbourne australia they relied on veteran hard rock 
producer terry manning to give them just enough rope diesel said 
backedup by a vocal saxophone reliable bass and punchy drums 
diesel attracted an international mix to match his own farflung 
origins frenchborn australian bernie bremond on saxophone 
angloaustralian drummer yak sherrit and native aussie johnny 
dalzell on bass 
their name is derived from the mumbled automotive double 
entendres of a new zealand maori friend and even it hearkens back 
to the harddriving innocence of american rock music in its infancy 
its still got some rough edges there more than rough edges 
really diesel concedes we like rockin but we can also be 
very tender 
their message is aimed at listeners emotions not their 
brainpower or political bent he says the basic ingredient is 
the accessibility of the music i want to give people goosebumps i 
dont want to get inside their brain and start kicking around or 
get on a pedestal and start waving a big stick 
judiciously sharing the solo spotlight with bremond diesel 
maintains command with lightningbolt guitar licks that could 
jumpstart a frankenstein monster and he dispenses original song 
lyrics with a clear rangy voice tinged at times with mainstream 
rock influences and at others sounding a bit like marlon brandos 
deranged colonel in apocalypse now 
but he isnt afraid to calm down take a step back and turn 
soulful 
listening to the album on some tracks we sound like a bunch 
of angry little brats and in other songs we sound sort of like 
40yearold mellowedout memphis musicians he said 
born mark lisotte to american parents diesel traveled with his 
family of nine in a volkswagen van to and from his fathers 
itinerate sax gigs around the northeastern united states before 
they packed up and headed down under when he was 9 
a huge hit at home and popular in europe he made new waves in 
the united states with american critics who likened him to john 
cougar mellencamp and bruce springsteen 
but to make it with american audiences diesel will have to keep 
touring here he recently concluded a north americaneuropean jaunt 
that featured stops in canada washington chicago and familiar 
haunts in texas 
we just kind of roll along soaking up influences as we go 
along like a sponge he said europe is great and we loving 
playing at home but we really fell for texas which is kind of 
like western australia hot dry and flat 
through nightclub smoke he might be mistaken for a youthful 
james dean with his ripped tshirt and crewcut look and his 
matineeidol good looks may help draw an american audience to his 
midwestern style yet he doesnt want to lose touch with the basic 
rock roots he reveres styles that include bb king and buddy 
holly 
weve done gigs with bands whose wardrobe cases were bigger 
than anything else they had with them i couldnt see the point in 
that he said our image is who we are not what we wear and a 
guitar is the ultimate accessory you could ever put on you dont 
need anything else 
a sophomore album is scheduled for the spring but diesel is 
sure his hopedfor us success wont be founded on studio work a 
pro by age 15 he has played countless gigs in nameless australian 
venues and plans to continue traveling i think touring is a 
great thing the only thing no matter who youre playing to 
perth is by no means a small city with a population topping 
800000 still diesel calls it the most remote city in the world 
the closest things to it are africa and asia but its nurtured a 
lot of good bands he said 
but that isolation has its advantages too partly allowing the 
band to build and retain some element of purity 
weve been left to our own devices diesel said no one 
has ever told us what to do what to where or what to look like

the mood of wall streets stock market 
forecasters is distinctly downbeat as they look ahead to 1990 
thats pretty unusual in an industry known for diehard optimism 
some observers suggest it may be influenced by the depressed state 
of the securities business as much as by the behavior of stock 
prices which still stand near record highs 
whatever the source of the seers misgivings it strikes one 
group of observers as a healthy rather than a troublesome sign 
these followers of the doctrine of contrary opinion believe 
that the more wary the mood the better are the markets chances to 
do well 
richard hoey chief economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
says his november survey of 171 managers and analysts at investing 
institutions turned up the lowest enthusiasm for the stock market 
outlook since he began conducting his periodic decisionmakers 
poll in 1983 
just 111 percent of the respondents said they expected stocks 
three months hence to be in a bull market while 521 percent 
forecast a bear market and 368 percent said they were looking for 
a neutral atmosphere 
in addition hoey reported there was a dramatic rise in the 
consensus probability of a stock market crash in the us in the 
next two years to 425 percent from 266 percent in august 
by contrast hoeys respondents were emphatically bullish about 
the chances for higher bond prices and thus lower longterm 
interest rates with bulls outnumbering bears by better than 
4to1 
investors intelligence of new rochelle ny finds no such 
extremes in its weekly survey of 130 independent advisory services 
on the stock market 
but its latenovember tally of 462 bulls 345 percent bears 
and 193 percent in the camp looking for a correction or 
shortterm pullback hardly qualifies as a ringing note of optimism 
given the background of a sevenyear bull market that has 
brought bountiful rewards to people who owned just about any 
category of financial investment why so much doubt 
for one thing some analysts say the economy is slowing and so 
has the expansion of money and credit that helped fuel the 
investment boom in the 1980s 
slower money and credit growth would suggest that investors 
will have to grapple with the question of how to invest in a lower 
growth economy charles clough chief investment strategist at 
merrill lynch said in the firms annual appraisal of the outlook 
after a decade of dynamic investment returns in the financial 
markets investors are likely to find that in a lower growth 
economy annual returns from bonds stocks and especially money 
market instruments are likely to be of far more modest 
proportions he added 
in the 1990s clough suggests money may tend to find a home in 
business projects that increase productivity rather than in real 
estate or financial assets 
this is a twoedged sword for the financial markets it makes 
for a more productive economy but it also leads to a drain of 
liquidity from financial assets he said 
confirmed contrarians however may be undaunted by all 
these seemingly negative numbers and words they believe 
essentially that gloom works to build a store of untapped future 
demand for stocks while euphoria exhausts investors buying power 
hoey noted that his survey has no record of predicting major 
bear markets since no such prolonged decline has occurred since he 
started the poll seven years ago 
but he observes the stock sentiment survey has been a very 
useful contrary opinion indicator when it has hit extreme levels 
in august 1987 he noted bullish sentiment reached 572 percent 
just before the slide that culminated in the oct 19 black monday 
crash 
in january 1988 when the market was just beginning to launch a 
powerful recovery from the crash the ranks of the bulls had 
thinned to 124 percent

the 1988 drought relief program paid millions of 
dollars to farmers across the country whose only claims to disaster 
were normal bouts with the perils of nature one reason the program 
was applied so broadly the associated press found was the very 
structure of the payment system the second story in a fourpart 
series cashing in on the drought explains how farmers 
allocated taxpayer dollars to their neighbors

rb reynolds decides how to spend 
millions of federal agriculture dollars each year he implements 
federal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government worker 
reynolds however is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician 
but a wheat and corn farmer here in windswept hartley county 
he was elected by his texas panhandle neighbors to be chairman 
of the threemember committee that runs hartley countys office of 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
every us county with some agriculture has a threefarmer 
committee elected by fellow farmers to direct the local office of 
the ascs which runs all the multibilliondollar federal 
agriculture payment programs 
its a job considered unique among government aid programs with 
the very recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many 
potential problems and conflicts are obvious would welfare 
mothers determine their friends monthly checks or students decide 
roommates eligibility for loans but agriculture officials believe 
the elected committee members are in the best position to assess 
fairly the losses suffered by their neighbors and to keep them 
honest 
we have to follow the rules that come down but we try to 
represent the farmer and his needs and what would be best for 
him reynolds said if you dont represent the farmer whos 
going to 
the question of who to protect the farmer or the government is 
at times a difficult one for conscientious committee members one 
day after reynolds sided with farmers in an interview he told a 
reporter he preferred to say committee members have to represent 
both sides and mediate to try to work something out 
most committee members interviewed for an associated press study 
of the 1988 drought relief effort said they voted for the good of 
their neighbors whenever possible 
i would say youre representing the farmer maybe thats not 
the way its supposed to be said mike bouris chairman of the 
riverside calif county committee 
you dont want your neighbor to be mad at you because he 
didnt qualify said john rigolizzo jr the camden county nj 
committee chairman yes you could say hes sticking up for his 
buddy and his neighbor but when were in this office were 
government employees 
committee members who are paid small stipends for their 
meetings take an oath of office pledging to uphold the laws of 
congress agriculture department officials say they expect the 
committees to protect taxpayers as well as be fair to farmers 
they represent both but they have rules and regulations they 
have to obey dan shaw the ascs deputy administrator in charge 
of state and county operations said from washington dc 
they cant just say this is a deprived area so lets take all 
the money in the treasury and throw it out here shaw said we 
feel peers are the people who can make the really good accurate 
decisions that need to be made 
committees have great latitude in administering agriculture 
programs from establishing normal harvests to deciding if a crop 
was cultivated properly they must sometimes analyze farmers 
financial standings and sort through corporations partnerships and 
trusts they also have to interpret an array of laws and 
regulations 
some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret the smart 
people can read that and find ways to get around it said don 
gronewald a hay farmer who is member of the kaufman county texas 
committee 
all of the programs are good programs and when they put them 
out they had good intentions but youre going to find somebody 
abusing and using the program to their benefit and that makes it 
harder for the honest joe gronewald said 
agriculture experts say farming in america is so vast that the 
local committee system is the only fair way to administer the aid 
programs 
there are these glitches two counties end up rendering two 
different decisions said bob bergland agriculture secretary 
under former president carter but you have to have room for 
local judgment id say it works better than almost any other 
scheme you can think of 
in the case of the drought program many committees had to set 
crop yields and estimate how much would have been harvested in a 
normal year as well as decide if a farmer kept his crop properly 
fertilized weeded and if possible watered 
and the committees of three had to decide whether each applicant 
farmer was eligible 
in some cases a county committee was more gracious with its 
constituents than either insurance companies evaluating the same 
losses or committees in neighboring counties interpreting the same 
regulations the ap found 
a crop insurance company balked at paying one oklahoma farmer an 
irrigated yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo because 
he had watered just once insurance paid only the dryland yield of 
28 bushels but the county committee granted drought relief based 
on the irrigated 69bushel yield the farmer received 4467 
the committee made a determination that it was watered said 
david f barnes jr director of the texas county okla ascs 
office 
the chaves county nm committee decided to pay a farmer 
18285 for cotton damage caused by cold rainy weather and 
high winds although the bill contained provision for neither 
freezelike damage nor wind damage 
the drought relief program was particularly troublesome for some 
committees because it was set up with such haste officials said 
some farmers harvested their crops before applying for aid making 
losses difficult to verify 
in gaines county texas ascs director john wayne hall said he 
struggled with 1988 claims for lost winter wheat a crop planted 
in 1987 and cut months before congress even considered the drought 
legislation 
how can i know what kind of product that boy had out there it 
was long gone hall said in 88 we made a lot of judgments 
a recent general accounting office report noted that the 1988 
relief program was hard to administer because it required county 
officials to determine on short notice payments on close to 500 
crops from almonds to zucchini the officials had little 
experience or data on most of those crops 
the program happened awful fast said steve verrill 
committee chairman in middlesex county mass it was the disaster 
in the midwest and everybody including the politicians were 
talking it up and they were in an awful hurry to get the money 
out 
both the elected farmers and the county directors they hire say 
the pressure from farmers even in more normal years can be 
intense 
if i give everybody what they want i can get along said 
hall if i say hey the regulations say you cant do that it 
makes em mad 
hall sometimes makes em mad anyway 
as long as they the government pay me ill enforce it he 
said

susy thomas is closer than ever to realizing a 
dream she has held through five children and 11 years of training 
that involved 40mile commutes to class 
the 37yearold member of the navajo tribe near tohatchi nm 
wants to join the small number of navajos trained to teach in us 
schools 
i want to teach elementary education because among native 
americans early childhood education is important mrs thomas 
said during an interview after being named by the national council 
of teachers of english as the groups first presidential scholar 
i want to let them know they are native americans and they 
have a big world to conquer she added 
mrs thomas of the red running into the water people clan 
was awarded 1000 to help her complete her parttime studies in 
1991 at the university of new mexico gallup nm 
she currently is taking courses in art history and education 
foundation at a university branch near home she plans to save the 
1000 check until the fall when she will make her final push to 
complete about 22 hours 
the softspoken woman accepted the award during the councils 
annual convention in baltimore wearing a native blackandred satin 
dress silverchain belt and boots standing on stage with her were 
14 youngsters from the chuska school where she is a speech therapy 
assistant 
chuska school is an elementary boarding school for indian 
children who live in the rugged country of the navajo reservation 
the bureau of indian affairs says just 41 percent of its 1039 
teachers were indians in 1987 chuska school principal helen 
zongolowicz said few indians are trained to teach in us schools 
mainly because of the small size of the minority group and the high 
dropout rate 
among navajos the dropout rate in elementary and secondary 
school is about 30 percent with a higher percentage for college 
students 
my husband is very supportive of the idea of my getting my 
degree and going into teaching said mrs thomas hes a 
counselor himself working with children in kindergarten through 
the third grade these are the years to really work with them get 
them to use their mind and set their goals their minds are very 
delicate 
when she was an elementary student mrs thomas recalled we 
were punished if we were caught talking in navajo she said many 
of her friends eventually dropped out because of the negative 
attitudes about language and indian culture 
mrs thomas said she refused to give up because i was the 
oldest in the family i gave some of what i learned to my younger 
brothers and they looked up to me my parents praised me and i 
had no choice i had to become the interpreter for the family 
the idea of teaching young children first came when mrs thomas 
was in the eighth grade and second and thirdgrade teachers 
would have us work with them 
to attend high school she said we traveled 50 miles one way 
each day about an hour on the bus mrs thomas is the first 
woman in her family to complete high school she married shortly 
after graduating and focused on raising a family her husband 
returned to school to earn a degree in counseling 
mrs thomas worked for a time as a substitute teachers aide 
the principal there was telling me you should go back to school 
and take classes in the evening she said 
eventually despite her growing family she began working toward 
an associate degree in speech pathology shifting later to special 
education and holding jobs in that field before deciding she 
wanted the broader focus of teaching language arts in the primary 
grades 
a lot of couples go to school together and get degrees said 
mrs thomas referring to younger navajo adults but it has been 
a struggle going to school course by course all of this time 
she has to travel 40 miles one way for classes on the gallup 
campus 
a staff development course two summers ago at the chuska school 
sparked mrs thomas desire to become an elementary language arts 
teacher with its emphasis on writing and reading about topics 
linked to students own lives a whole language approach works 
well in involving indian youngsters in school learning she said 
in the whole language approach we use things from the 
childrens own environment and everyday activities at home and we 
see more achievement she said 
we were punished but now its praise and positive 
reinforcement she said i think of all these people on the 
reservation out of school on the street learning would have 
meant more to them they got lost 
i know children in elementary school today will succeed i 
look at their work hanging in the hallways its amazing to compare 
it with what our teachers had us do when i was a child

poet robert frost won four pulitzer 
prizes and the adoration of millions by traveling the road not 
taken as one of his poems relates 
but ask a poet or scholar who most influenced poetry in the 20th 
century and the likely answer will be william carlos williams a 
physician whose clear modernist cadence broke centuries of 
convention 
he was one of my strongest influences said allen ginsberg 
the bard of the beat generation he was part of a group that was 
the most important thing to happen to american poetry in this 
century 
in retrospect williams not frost took the one less 
traveled by he chose medical school and private practice over 
the bohemian life of his contemporaries indeed scholars attribute 
williams medical training his eye for picking details from the 
mundane with distinguishing him from lesser poets 
his books of poetry include collected poems and pictures 
from brueghel for which he won a pulitzer in 1963 he also wrote 
critical essays plays novels and short stories 
his verse gained international recognition in 1913 for his 
second collection the tempers his contemporaries gertrude 
stein ernest hemingway and schoolmate ezra pound fled what they 
saw as the oppressive capitalist climate of early 20th century 
america but williams chose to remain in the united states in tiny 
rutherford a rural town on a knoll rising above the empty new 
jersey meadowlands in view of the growing manhattan skyline he 
turned his observations of common life into innovations 
langdon hammer an associate professor of english at yale 
university said williams work elevated american poetry to the 
forefront of the modernist movement of the early 20th century 
displacing the more formal british school 
he has a status like that of yeats or elliot said hammer 
ginsberg first met williams while working as a reporter for a 
leftwing paterson nj labor paper 
i cooked up some excuse to interview him because i had heard 
him recite at the museum of modern art ginsberg said it 
opened my eyes immediately his poetry was simply an intensified 
form of speech 
ginsberg recalled sending williams a letter with some poems 
after the interview the doctor sent them back telling him to go 
back to his notes to find the raw versions the less refined more 
natural drafts 
not long afterward in 1957 ginsberg published his classic 
poem howl 
williams lived in rutherford from his birth in 1883 until his 
death in 1963 treating the poor and middleclass families of 
surrounding towns and the gritty mill city of paterson about 10 
miles to the north the city would be the subject of the 
fivevolume epic poem paterson written between 1946 and 1958 
williams also left his mark on medicine eventually becoming 
chief of staff at passaic general hospital and a recognized pioneer 
in pediatrics one of the first doctors to make it his specialty 
his son dr william eric williams lives and practices medicine 
in the same home his grandparents purchased in the late 1880s 
dealing with the legacy of his father spending endless hours with 
english professors and biographers and answering the same 
questions from journalists time and again has taken a lot out of 
him he says 
for 75 years ive been communicating with artists scholars 
reporters and writers about my father he said in a brief 
interview i cant get my own work done and ive just had to stop 
giving my time away 
but surprisingly in a state where the ultimate tribute may be 
getting ones name on a new jersey turnpike reststop williams 
reputation has remained obscure beyond scholars and other poets 
its almost like we havent figured out what place he holds in 
our history said john dollar a retired fairleigh dickinson 
university professor who used to read to williams after the poets 
vision was impaired by a stroke in the late 1950s 
in the rutherford public library williams books photographs 
and paintings clutter a tiny room dedicated to the poet but it is 
locked and dark most of the time 
dollar and a handful of other former acquaintances and fans help 
gather artifacts from the poets life we dont know quite what 
to do with this room dollar said im afraid its fallen into 
disarray 
williams greatest talent was his ability to draw meaning from 
common things scholars say pound wrote him many times imploring 
him to leave rutherford for europe 
composition on a typewriter considered an eccentricity and 
even reviled by some critics at the time cultivated in williams 
an interest in the physical shape of the verse as well as its sound 
and message 
if rutherfords image of the poetdoctor remains illdefined 
his memory lives on in the william carlos williams center for 
performing arts opened a decade ago in the abandoned tivoli 
theatre building but the man who worked so hard for the poor and 
infirm has won little wide acclaim 
they never understood him really said dollar i believe 
it was one of the things that truly bothered him the fairleigh 
dickinson university never gave him an honorary degree although 
he spoke there often they never recognized what they had right 
under their noses

a crippled c123 lies on an 
airstrip flanked by sandbagged bunkers stacks of ammunition and 
men in fatigues nearby a field of colorful opium poppies can be 
seen swaying in the breeze 
flying into this remote town ringed by jungled mountains seems 
an eerie descent into the indochina war and two decades back in 
time 
on closer inspection however the howitzer shells prove to be 
of wood the crashed military transport is a hollow fake and 
110000 silk and polyester flowers make up the field of deadly 
opium 
and the blueeyed macho type running out of a flyblown bar that 
has just been skewered by a hunk of exploding airplane wing happens 
to be actor mel gibson 
welcome to air america hollywoods recreation of the 
mayhem political machinations and hellraising known as the 
secret war in laos 
in real life air america was an outfit owned by the central 
intelligence agency in laos it supported the vientiane government 
and an army of ciapaid hmong tribals who battled the communist 
pathet lao and their north vietnamese allies 
grizzled veterans of past conflicts and retired military pilots 
from the war in neighboring vietnam flew for this secret shuttle 
service they carried guerrillas refugees rice ammunition and 
most controversially opium 
the pilots were variously described as mercenaries patriots and 
the finest bunch of airplane drivers that has ever been got 
together anywhere they flew and sometimes died by the motto 
anything anywhere anytime 
the film focuses on the relationship between two pilots played 
by gibson and robert downey jr as they fight drink and womanize 
in a bizarre war that officially doesnt exist 
were not here so what you and i just saw didnt happen an 
obnoxious cia man lectures gibson who has vainly tried to rescue a 
fellow pilot charlie from a burning plane moments earlier the 
film shows president nixon announcing on television that the united 
states was not militarily involved in laos 
it may not have happened to you and it may not have happened 
to nixon but it sure as hell happened to charlie gibson snaps 
back 
director roger spottiswoode said he hopes the finished product 
will work both as an adventure film featuring aerial stunts and 
darkish humor and one with some political undertones 
gibson plays an outwardly cynical veteran flier who has made 
his uneasy peace with a world he knows is corrupt the director 
said downey portrays a younger man fresh out of los angeles where 
he had his helicopter license yanked who balks at compromise and 
rebels when he discovers he has been ferrying opium 
some air america veterans have grumbled to the producers that 
they would be depicted as a bunch of drug runners and that the 
story of the secret war would be distorted the cia has had made no 
comment 
while an earlier discarded script reportedly was studded with 
black humor and sharp slants on the war the political guts were 
torn out of the final script and the pilots are portrayed as 
heroes the final version goes lightly on the official american 
conduct of the war in laos which included extensive secret 
bombing a string of lies and the cias helping hand in the 
marketing of opium for its hilltribe allies 
a great deal of effort however has gone into recapturing the 
look and atmosphere of 1971 laos 
the filmmakers relied in part on the book air america by 
christopher robbins as well as archival material and interviews 
with indochina war veterans some of whom have settled in thailand 
and took small parts in the film 
marhsaled for the movie was a force of 26 aircraft some 1700 
crew and extras and a budget of 35 million 
it gives one more respect for dwight d eisenhower when he 
launched dday said producer daniel melnick stalking the set 
wearing a cap emblazoned with three stars and maj gen melnick 
northern thailand was chosen for more than two months of 
location shooting because of its close resemblence to neighboring 
laos some of the same tribal groups live on both sides of the 
border and opium from which heroin is refined is still grown in 
both countries 
awardwinning production designer allan cameron dressed up 
sections of chiang mai the major city of northern thailand to 
resemble the laotian capital of vientiane real bar girls were 
brought up from bangkok to the recreated white rose a pilot 
hangout in vientiane where the sexual acrobatics were as madcap as 
the aerial ones 
mae hong son proved strikingly similar to long tieng a 
sprawling ciarun base dubbed spook heaven by journalists that 
mushroomed into the second largest city in laos 
three hangars a hospital warehouse and operations center were 
built at mae hong sons once sleepy airport with the thai military 
providing the aircraft and extra pilots 
as downey arrives from the united states a baseball bat slung 
over his shoulder spottiswoode tries to capture the frenetic 
activity of what was at the height of the war one of the busiest 
airports in the world a damaged light aircraft dangles by a cable 
from a big sikorsky helicopter while a c123 taxies a light 
observation helicopter descends and medics rush a wounded air 
america pilot from a huey chopper 
a few hundred yards away gibson slings a wounded refugee over 
his shoulder and flees pathet lao troops who have burst into a 
squalid refugee camp a small charge set below dirt and coconut 
husks bursts just ahead of him and the take ends

defense employs one in every three scientists 
and engineers and a fifth of the countrys manufacturing workers 
so washingtons new worry is whether slashing the military budget 
could lead to wrenching readjustments in the economy 
this time most of the experts are optimistic except for 
localized repercussions in oneindustry towns the plowshare 
prospects raised by president bush and mikhail gorbachev in the 
stormy seas off malta promise mostly benefits they say 
still some analysts are worried about local depressions and 
whether managers can adopt to civilian production at a time of 
extreme import competition 
id like to see the government come up with a plan to help 
people in a graceful and humane way but you talk about an 
industrial policy in this country and they call you a communist 
says lawrence j korb who served in the reagan administration as 
an assistant defense secretary 
congress joint economic committee is concerned enough to have 
called hearings this week and next on the economic consequences 
of reduced defense spending and the winding down of the cold war 
there is not much dispute that military spending is heading in 
only one direction down defense secretary richard cheney has told 
his service chiefs to list programs that can be slowed or 
jettisoned 
former rand corp executive william w kaufmann now at harvard 
and the brookings institution says that if the ussoviet 
relationship continues to blossom the defense budget can shrink by 
half in 10 years 
virtually no one thinks the defense budget will not fall 
says gordon adams director of the defense budget project a 
washington research outfit 
everyone is pretty well convinced that it is going to be at 
best flat agrees john ruby chief operating officer of ford 
aerospace the weaponry arm of ford motor co therell probably 
be fewer ships planes and tanks built 
one scenario said to have been floated by cheney himself calls 
for trimming previous estimates of pentagon spending which some 
consider intentionally padded by 180 billion over five years 
with most coming in the last two years this years pentagon 
spending amounts to 300 billion 
depending on its size and speed a substantial cut in defense 
spending phased in over a number of years could be one of the best 
things that could happen to the economy says charles schultze 
who was president carters chief economic adviser one thing this 
country does not have is a surplus of skilled engineers and skilled 
workmen 
still when the machines of war are complex electronic systems 
the task of converting plants and jobs to a civilian economy isnt 
as easy as it was after world war ii when detroit shifted smoothly 
from making tanks to making buicks 
no civilian market exists for stealth aircraft or sidewinder 
missiles and managers used to the hothouse environment of pentagon 
contracting with no competition from overseas a single 
cooperative customer and costplusprofit accounting may have 
trouble adjusting to marketplace realities 
defense contractors are used to being told what the market 
is says consultant jacques gansler author of affording 
defense and a pentagon procurement official in 197277 the 
commercial world isnt like that 
he says longterm planning is required if you start to plan 
when you get your notice to close the plant youre in trouble 
seymour melman retired professor of industrial engineering at 
columbia university and a pioneer advocate of planned conversion 
strongly disagrees with those who say the economy can absorb 
military budget cuts without severe dislocations 
he argues that to smooth the transition an elaborate government 
retraining and readjustment program will be required 
no planning can mean a crisis for defense industry workers 
melman says 
what are they going to work at he asks making shoes 
eightyfive percent of our shoes are imported consumer 
electronics all imported machine tools half are imported 
moreover melman argues defense managers are equally incapable 
of making the leap to the civilian economy without retraining 
putting them in the private economy with the habits acquired in a 
lifetime of doing business only with the pentagon would invite 
disaster he says 
to make his point he cites the technological chauvinism 
that led aerospace engineers to design elaborate trolley cars for 
the massachusetts bay transit authority which repeatedly broke down 
no major militaryserving enterprise has demonstrated an 
autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch 
that is needed to go civilian melman wrote in his book 
profits without production 
if you unleash these people the us will turn into a 
thirdrate economy melman says they cant hack it we will 
lose the capability of repairing the damage 
but economist sar levitan of george washington university says 
the american economy will create demand for the goods and services 
laidoff defense workers can provide 
we have found in the last few years that human needs are 
insatiable he says even if everyone has a refrigerator we 
want vcrs and toys for the kids that cost hundreds of dollars we 
want more vacations and more health care if it is an orderly 
diminution in the defense establishment then i dont think it 
would be a verious serious problem 
but he adds if the economy is weak congress would be much 
more resistant to any defense cuts whether we need the weapons or 
not 
liberals in congress have pushed for years for conversion 
legislation to ease the transition away from big defense layouts 
under a version sponsored by rep ted weiss dny defense 
contractors would be required to put 125 percent of receipts into 
a fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment laidoff workers 
might get 90 percent of their lost salaries while being retrained 
for civilian jobs 
opponents see such proposals as governmental interference in the 
free market 
says adams counseling retraining job search and relocation 
programs are critical income supplements however slow the 
adjustment process 
says melman in rebuttal in other words let the working 
stiffs take a job at any pay 
some defense contractors dont want to think about converting to 
the civilian economy no matter what the future levels of defense 
spending 
we have no plans to go to commercial accounts says pete 
connolly spokesman for general dynamics in st louis there may 
be fewer swords to beat into plowshares but thats what were 
going to continue to do 
gansler senior vice president of analytic sciences corp says 
defense spending cuts have only a gradual impact generally 
pentagon contracts provide for prohibitive penalty payments if they 
are canceled 
and when you stop spending in some areas of defense you have 
to increase it in others gansler adds you want to increase 
your intelligence gathering and your longterm research and 
development so that there are no technological surprises in store 
i dont look for a trashing of the industry

this first installment of a threepart christmas 
series about the relatives of jesus deals with his ancestral roots 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
everyone is a special sum of ancestry to enhance or diminish 
through a lifetime that was so for the child of christmas the 
product of a heritage 
some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery 
before time itself but others accord him a thoroughly natural 
family tree 
he was in the beginning with god says one account a 
word or logos a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the creator 
before the world began yet other passages say he was made like 
his brethren in every respect 
son of man he usually called himself but also son of 
god 
he combined universality with particularity the divine 
and human model writes church historian jaroslav pelican in his 
book jesus through the centuries it says a key question put to 
him was where do you come from 
although seldom noted he had a long string of forbears as well 
as contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help his 
lineage ran deep into jewish history 
as with most people if their descent is traced back far enough 
he had a checkered ancestry good and bad the lowly and great 
kings betrayers heroes adulterers warriors and prostitutes 
it was an odd assortment like humanity itself alien gentiles 
and fellow jews the weak and strong upright and corrupt the fact 
that he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic 
to his purpose becoming identified with all humankind 
they were all members of jesus family his greatgreatgreat 
grandaddies and grandmamas in the faith wrote church scholar 
william h willimon for all their weaknesses and shortcomings 
this motley but richly human crew were indeed his people 
two genealogies of jesus are recorded one in the first chapter 
of the book of matthew the other in the third chapter of the book 
of luke they vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably 
assume luke gives the line of his mother mary and that matthew 
gives that of joseph legally the father 
it is possible that the original genealogy did interpret 
joseph as the father of jesus that is that it had been formulated 
before the understanding of jesus as the divinely generated son of 
god writes new testament scholar henrikus boers in his book 
who was jesus 
some progenitors are on both lists including olden patriarchs 
of judaism and israels great king david along with other lesser 
figures of sundry character 
matthew lists 41 ancestors starting back at the time of 
abraham ancient father of israel and other early patriarchs 
isaac and jacob 
luke lists 77 progenitors in reverse order starting with joseph 
and enumerating others going back to the first man adam and 
finally to his creator god 
other figures out of dim antiquity also are included such as 
noah and that legend of longevity methuselah who lived 969 
years all designated ancestors of jesus 
in the mostly male lists four women are named and theyre a 
mixed group a soldiers beautiful wife bathsheba seduced by 
king david the harlot of jericho rahab the sexually maneuvering 
cananite tamar and the loyal mohabite ruth 
tamar was the daugherinlaw of judah son of the patriarch 
jacob her husband died and after prolonged widowhood she 
disguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her fatherinlaw to 
lie with her she bore twins one named perez also among jesus 
forbears 
rahab was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the 
israelite warriorleader joshua to spy out jericho before taking 
it she hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop 
she later helped the pair escape lowering them on a rope from a 
window in her house which was built into the city wall by 
agreement with the two her clan was spared when jericho was 
destroyed her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window 
the devoted woman of moab ruth widowed by her hebrew husband 
insisted on returning with her motherinlaw naomi to israel 
with these memorable words for where you go i will go your 
people will be my people and your god my god 
on naomis advice ruth worked in the harvest sleeping at the 
feet of the owner boaz thus winning him as her husband they were 
parents of obed father of jesse who fathered king david 
his philandering with bathsheba the gorgeous wife of an absent 
military officer uriah produced sons nathan and future king 
solomon alternatively listed in jesus line of descent 
other men on the lists also displayed foibles such as jacobs 
deceiving his father to gain an inheritance and even abraham 
fearfully palming off his lovely wife sarah as his sister to 
placate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in egypt 
nevertheless those honored patriarchs also displayed courage 
initiative and devotion in their covenant with god to lead a people 
that would be a promised light to the nations 
the great israelite military commander joshua successor to 
moses also is listed along with a long succession of kings 
decent and debauched in addition to charming psalmsinging david 
and wise solomon credited with the book of proverbs and builder of 
jerusalems first temple 
other kings include rehoboam whose oppressions idolatrous 
rites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom 
uzziah stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign and hezekiah 
who led reforms under guidance of the prophet micah 
also listed is manasseh described as the most wicked king of 
judah whose religious deviations included baalism exaltation of 
the idol astarte wizardry and molech worship that involved forcing 
children through fire 
tradition has it that manasseh had the great prophet isaiah 
sawed asunder 
one king listed josiah took the throne at age 8 when his 
father amon was murdered but josiah had a long just reign 
ousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost book of law in 
repairing the temple 
of many others named some are clouded uncertain figures while 
others are notable in jewish annals such as judah founder of a 
main israelite tribe and the prophet nathan who rebuked david for 
his illicit affair 
the mixed lot of people with their sundry faults and strengths 
were all part of the promise fulfilled by the christ child 
willimon writes they for all their weaknesses were 
instruments of the promise 
on the other hand jesus descent also is traced directly to the 
godhead adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity 
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and 
the word was god says the distinctively interpretative gospel of 
john and the word became flesh and dwelt among us full of grace 
and truth 
he is fully god and fully man classic christian doctrine 
says his conception by the virgin mary is ascribed by the gospels 
to divine intervention st paul calls him the image of the 
invisible god 
jesus himself though he was generally elusive about it and 
though he identified closely with common folk sometimes laid it 
out plainly as related by johns gospel 
truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am he 
said i and the father are one the father is in me and i am 
in the father

this second article in a threepart christmas 
series about relatives of jesus deals with elizabeth and john the 
baptist 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the shaggy desert hermit pointed a bony finger at the 
approaching newcomer and exclaimed behold the lamb of god who 
takes away the sin of the world 
that startling conclusion about jesus came from a recluse of the 
wilderness john the baptist he also was a relative of jesus 
perhaps a cousin who apparently didnt recognize him at first 
the baptizer among numerous recorded kinfolk of that 
special progeny of christmas had quit his notable family in 
jerusalem to dwell alone in the barren hills north of the dead sea 
his impulsive lofty assessment of jesus as the redeemer of 
humanity is the way christians have reacted to jesus through the 
ages writes new testament scholar henrikus boers 
yet links between their differing ministries may promise the 
fullest answer to the question who was jesus boers adds in 
a new book by that name analyzing the historical basis of jesus 
life 
while jesus and john effused high mutual esteem they also 
showed some touchiness about each other 
among those born of women there has risen no one greater than 
john the baptist jesus said calling him more than a prophet 
and crediting him with starting the good news of the kingdom of 
god 
in according john that decisive role jesus revealed that he 
understood himself to be living in a time when the kingdom of god 
had already arrived says boers of emory university 
john was the son of an aged jerusalem couple in the jewish 
priestly class zechariah and his wife elizabeth lukes gospel 
terms her a kinswoman of mary mother of jesus 
when mary mysteriously became pregnant before her marriage to 
joseph she hastily left her parents home in upland nazareth to 
visit her city relatives they too were in a bewildered state 
luke relates 
the old priest zechariah had been struck dumb temporarily when 
his wife aged and presumed barren had incredibly conceived she 
was in her sixth month and the babe leaped in her womb on 
marys arrival 
elizabeth bubbled with affection an older city woman to her 
young country cousin both expectant mothers blessed are you 
among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb 
mary exulted my soul magnifies the lord for he who is 
mighty has done great things for me 
mary stayed three months before returning to nazareth and 
marriage to the temporarily perturbed but finally understanding 
joseph 
about that time elizabeth gave birth and zechariah suddenly 
could speak again predicting a pivotal place for his new son 
named john 
you child will be called the prophet of the most high 
going before the lord to prepare his way and giving knowledge 
of salvation to his people through the tender mercy of our 
god 
as a young man john withdrew into the desert evidently not 
consorting with his slightly younger kinsman jesus on finally 
encountering him as an adult john says he did not know him 
but their paths crossed dramatically 
they differed strikingly in temperament and behavior in 
contrast to jesus sociable disposition mixing warmly with all 
comers john was a rigidly disciplined loner both were criticized 
for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he 
has a demon jesus said the son of man came eating and 
drinking and they say behold a glutton and drunkard a friend 
of tax collectors and sinners 
john had dwelt alone in the desolate mountainous wastelands 
west of the jordan living on locusts and wild honey absorbing the 
secrets of vast silences and the stars 
out of that long solitude he came down to the jordan banks a 
bristly figure clad in a camel pelt tied with leather thongs 
exhorting 
repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand he raised his 
arms like spiny branches toward the sky prepare the way of the 
lord 
he drew growing crowds soldiers tradespeople rabbis temple 
officials and others becoming known as the baptizer from 
baptizing many in the river 
some asked who he was a returned prophet elijah the christ 
no the craggy baptizer said i am the voice of one crying 
in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord 
he added i baptize you with water but he who is mightier 
than i is coming he will baptize you with the holy spirit 
jesus later appeared there and john neither recognized him nor 
realized their blood ties yet spontaneously saw something else in 
him calling him lamb of god who atones for human wrongs 
although protesting his unworthiness for it john baptized 
jesus who insisted on it 
as he emerged dripping from the water a heavenly glow like a 
dove descended on him the account says and a voice sounded 
this is my beloved son with whom i am well pleased 
eventually as jesus ministry began agents of galilees king 
herod antipas seized john the baptist imprisoned him in a dungeon 
and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the kings dancing 
stepdaughter 
gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from johns 
attacks on herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage but 
ancient jewish historian josephus says john also was suspected of 
inciting insurrection 
while in prison john had begun to wonder about jesus ministry 
and sent followers to ask are you he who is to come or shall we 
look for another 
jesus responded go and tell john what you hear and see the 
blind receive their sight and the lame walk lepers are cleansed 
and the deaf hear and the poor have good news preached to them 
and blessed is he who takes no offense at me 
this hinted at possible rivalry between them but jesus went on 
to extol the baptizer 
while christianity generally has minimized john as simply a 
forerunner of jesus the record shows lingering ties between them 
johns influence lasted long afterward in many places as related by 
the missionaryapostle paul 
jesus in his preaching often referred to john asking 
challenging questions about him to stump critics some 
contemporaries saw jesus as johns successor thinking jesus was 
the baptizer raised from the dead 
indicating the bracketing of their work jesus apostles once 
asked lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples 
jesus then recited under pressure of johns example that 
famous prayer known to all christianity as the lords prayer 
yet there was a poignant note as john watched his own star 
fading and that of jesus brightening he must increase but i 
must decrease john told his followers yet this joy of mine in 
now full 
grasping the historical solidarity between john and jesus 
writes new testament scholar wr farmer has become an essential 
first step toward an understanding of the mission and message of 
jesus 
the baptizer says the fourth gospel was not the light but 
came to bear witness to the light

this final part of a threepart christmas series 
is about the big galilean family of which jesus was a part 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
baffled and sometimes upset by jesus independent streak his 
family tried to curb him even his brothers did not believe 
him the record says but they stuck by him eventually becoming 
pillars of his cause 
a putative aunt sought to curry preferential status for her 
sons supposed cousins but he wouldnt play favorites when still 
a boy of l2 he distressed his elders by quitting them to converse 
with temple scholars 
son why have you treated us so his mother remonstrated 
noting that she and her husband joseph had hunted him for three 
days they did not understand his explanation about being drawn to 
gods house 
the pushandpull of those closest and dearest is a common 
experience in the best of families that sort of pressure rimmed 
jesus life the chafing caring concern of relatives he had many 
in that small closeknit enclave of israel bound together by its 
belief in one god in a pagan world 
relationships near and distant pervaded that tiny insulated 
society it was a hemmedoff connected household especially in 
jesus rural hometown of nazareth in upland galilee 
a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and 
among his own kin and in his own house he said indicating the 
negative reactions of kin to his newly launched ministry 
he marveled because of their disbelief marks gospel notes 
his family must have been aghast when nazareth townspeople 
dragged him angrily from the synagogue after his first sermon about 
liberty for captives and the oppressed and good news to the 
poor 
neighors intended to hurl him from a cliff but stopped at the 
last moment hesitating his gaze burned into them and they shrank 
back opening a path for him he walked away never going home 
again 
he who loves father or mother or son or daughter more than 
me is not worthy of me he said adding that his truth requires 
greater devotion than to parents wife children brothers sisters 
or even to ones own life 
his immediate family included a flock of brothers and 
sisters the record says naming james joses judas and simon 
plus an unspecified number of sisters 
differences exist about their exact relationship because of 
catholic belief in marys perpetual virginity some hold that the 
brothers and sisters were offspring of joseph by a previous 
marriage though this is without biblical support 
it also has been claimed they were cousins in the loose 
terminology of ancient times in any case a batch of them were 
linked in scripture with joseph and mary and obviously shared an 
upbringing with jesus 
scripture in saying jesus was marys firstborn son 
implies she later had others and in saying joseph knew her not 
until she had borne a son implies subsequent marital relations 
whichever it was a big family 
it tried to deter jesus ministry at the outset distressed by 
talk that he was beside himself his family descended on a 
synagogue where he was preaching intending to seize him 
when word reached him that your mother and your brothers are 
outside asking for you the personal pain of it must have torn 
him he lowered his head momentatily then spread his arms wide and 
said 
who are my mother and my brothers his gesture embraced 
everyone here are my mother and my brothers whoever does the 
will of god is my brother and sister and mother 
a poignant interlude it projected jesus work beyond intimate 
bonds to humanity at large but it must have hurt such steps are 
never without pain said the late theologian paul tillich 
noting that the depth of the gap between him and his family 
became acute only with the start of his public ministry tillich 
added 
something unconditional breaks into the conditional relations 
of the natural family and creates a community which is as intimate 
and strong as the family relations and at the same time infinitely 
superior to it 
jesus apparently rich aunt is identified in three of the 
gospels john referring to his mothers sister mark to 
salome and matthew to the mother of the sons of zebedee 
zebedee ran a properous fishing fleet on the sea of galilee and 
two of his sons james and john quit the business to become 
disciples of jesus presumably also cousins salome evidently was 
among wealthy women who supported jesus out of their means 
that james and john were cousins is further indicated when 
jesus on the cross assigned care of his mother to john a family 
responsibility not likely to be placed outside blood ties 
salome was a strongminded practical woman something of a 
firebrand like her sons whom jesus nicknamed sons of thunder 
she also was ambitious and she saw majestic prospects for jesus 
while some relatives doubted his course she felt sure of it 
even though misconstruing his goal as a restored jewish kingdom 
she wanted some key places reserved for family 
she put it bluntly a senior to a younger clan member command 
that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one 
at your left in your kingdom 
jesus looked fondly at his aunt and slowly shook his head you 
do not know what you are asking it aroused jealousy among his 
apostles he told them his domain would not be run like the roman 
occupation by force and domination 
impatience also was registered by jesus brothers his 
growing impact in rural galilee impressed them john 7 notes and 
they proposed he go to jerusalem for a coming festival to establish 
himself at the heart of judaism if he could 
leave here and go to judea they urged suggesting somewhat 
skeptically that if his works were genuine he could gain greater 
fame for no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly 
if you do these things show yourself to the world 
he looked at them affectionately reading their doubts my 
time has not yet come but your time is always here go to the 
feast yourselves 
later however he went curious crowds besieged him leading to 
his crucifixion by roman authorities and his resurrection 
that event transformed his brothers binding them to him in 
unwavering loyalty the oldest brother called james the just 
became head of the church in jerusalem his leadership ranked above 
the 12 apostles 
he presided over the churchs first council which widened doors 
of the new faith beyond jews to gentiles to all the world many 
scholars ascribe to him the biblical epistle of james with its call 
to apply jesus teachings in deeds 
be doers of the word he wrote faith if it has no works 
is dead 
after james was slain in rising revolutionary tides of the early 
ad 60s church historian eusebius says another brother of jesus 
simon took over church leadership in jerusalem 
initially unresponsive relatives became mainstays of the 
worldgirdling faith jesus started however he says the principle 
relationship extends beyond blood to all believers

in the 1960s space exploration opened 
new realms for dictionaries in the 70s fresh words sprouted from 
political scandal the watchwords of the 80s 
one dictionary editor nominates an acronym a single syllable 
that stirred growing fear through the decade 
you cant get away from it aids was the word of the 80s 
said james lowe senior editor of merriamwebster dictionaries 
headquartered here 
the abbreviation for acquired immune deficiency syndrome was 
seen and heard everywhere by the late 1980s 
the press wrote about it the schools taught about it it was 
something everybody talked about and knew about or should have 
lowe said 
the words of the 80s also emerged from new lifestyles from 
business from the kitchen from computers 
victoria neufeldt editorinchief of websters new world 
dictionary in cleveland offered a compound noun couch potato 
as typifying the decade 
it reflects our great concern with lifestyles during the 
1980s she said 
usually politics is a fertile source of new words but that 
hasnt been the case in the 1980s lowe said 
instead it was a decade when the battle cries of big business 
talk of poison pills and white knights became part of the 
general vocabulary and computer language moved from the office to 
the living room 
the decade opened with yuppie and gridlock we worried 
about toxic shock syndrome and lyme disease soon we were 
carrying laptops and doing spreadsheets on our pcs 
and fax became a verb 
the 80s took high five off the playgrounds and handler 
out of the boxing ring and into the political arena 
we drank blush wine and listened to new wave music on 
cds and laser discs we read romantic novels and called 
them bodicerippers and when the teenage children of the 
teenagers of the 1950s took to doowop it rocked into major 
dictionaries 
in the 70s americans made verbs out of nouns in the 80s we 
turned to adjectives microwaveable spelled both with and 
without the first e was listed by merriams ive even seen 
ovenable lowe said 
in 1988 computer virus was lowes new word of the year 
although the finished product may have the staid voice of 
authority new words get into the dictionary simply by repeated use 
in the popular press 
lowes lexicographers spend much of their day reading newspapers 
and magazines the wall street journal to playboy in hopes of 
spotting new words or new uses of words 
acceptance takes time and sometimes lexicographers are as 
behind the times as parents everywhere 
robert pease senior science editor for merriams recalled the 
day he first saw crack cocaine in a boston newspaper headline 
and told his children about the new word only to have them tell 
him it was already the talk of the schoolyards 
as the 1990s approached and historic events swept east europe 
the decade ended with a linguistic split decision on glasnost 
the new world editors included it in their 1988 update of their 
collegiate dictionary but the jury is still out at merriams 
most writers still treat it as a foreign term and include a 
definition lowe said when they stop including the 
explanation then it will be ready for inclusion 
looking to the next decade he predicted that most new words 
would continue to come from medicine the recently developed 
abortion pill ru486 may be the new word for the 1990s lowe 
said

despite all the ink hollywood gets defense 
has become a far higherflying industry in southern california 
since the days of world war iis rosie the riveter and the 
legendary lockheed skunk works 
now with the iron curtain rusting away by the day aerospace 
workers are wondering what is to become of their industry third 
largest in the los angeles region after businessfinancial services 
and tourism 
there were 420800 aerospace workers in the area last year 
2700 fewer than in 1987 according to a study released this month 
by the los angeles area chamber of commerce they made up about 7 
percent of the regions workers and earned nearly 8 percent of the 
wages paid 
national aerospace employment peaked at 1313000 in 1987 and 
has stayed about even since said david napier economic data 
service manager at the aerospace industries association in 
washington 
research suggests every 1 percent cut in real defense spending 
costs california 20000 to 30000 jobs directly or indirectly said 
david hensley head of uclas california economic forecasting group 
will efforts by some contractors to diversify into civilian 
aerospace and hightech be enough to offset a thawing of the cold 
war 
i was at an international aerospace conference and a guy 
there said he could see southern california being the rust belt 
of the 1990s said wolfgang demisch an aerospace analyst who now 
heads the research department at ubs securities in new york 
it was just said in passing of course as usual at these 
things there is somebody who throws you a grenade just to wake up 
the audience 
at places like los angelesbased hughes aircraft co they woke 
up long ago to the reality that defense spending after inflation 
adjustments has been declining for years 
were not abandoning the defense sector we regard that as our 
duty to the nation said d kenneth richardson who was appointed 
president of hughes earlier this month but we feel that in the 
future most of the growth and opportunity are outside defense 
hughes a unit of general motors corp is completing a 
sixmonth streamlining that includes 6000 layoffs among its 75000 
workers because of tighter defense budgets an additional 4100 
employees were laid off in 1986 
the satellites and defense electronics company is also moving 
into such areas as telecommunications and simulation and training 
systems for commercial airlines it recently won a 325 million 
contract to modernize canadas airtraffic control system and is 
bidding on a 210 million contract to upgrade data processing at 
the federal bureau of land management 
im an upbeat positive sort of fellow and i think the 
companys future is very good said richardson 
if less money for the military is accompanied by more for space 
southern california would benefit millions of dollars a year from 
the space program already have flooded in 
for example el segundobased rockwell international builder of 
the space shuttle said recently it had received a contract worth 
several hundred million dollars to build spare parts for the 
shuttle 
also boding well for the industry is civilian aircraft work 
where employment is growing fast 
the chamber of commerce study estimated that seattlebased 
boeing co overloaded with orders for civilian aircraft 
subcontracts about 2 billion worth of work each year to southern 
california firms 
the main bodies on boeing 747s are assembled by los 
angelesbased northrop corp which is vulnerable to military 
budget cutters because of its own 500 millionperplane stealth 
bomber program 
mcdonnell douglas corps douglas aircraft subsidiary in long 
beach has added many workers because of a backlog of orders for 
md80 commercial jets and the launching of its md11 and md90 
aircraft 
longer term if defense cuts helped lower the national deficit 
california and other areas could benefit from lower interest rates 
that would generate more jobs some economists contend 
fred cannon senior economist for bank of america said less 
defense spending also might be a blessing because theres not 
much of what economists call value added in that segment 
when you make items for the military youre basically 
producing something and then just storing it cannon said in 
other parts of the economy youre producing something selling 
it servicing it maybe reselling it and on and on theres much 
more value added 
severe cuts in defense contracting would close a postworld war 
ii era in southern california littered with lore from john 
northrop retiring in 1952 brokenhearted that his flying wing 
bomber was canceled to the maiden flight of northrops b2 stealth 
bomber a flying wing last july 
perhaps even more famous is lockheeds socalled skunk works in 
burbank site of the development of the p80 jet fighter in 1945 
then the u2 and the sr71 blackbird spy planes and in this decade 
the stealth fighter 
subcultures grew up around the industry like the throngs that 
parked near the burbank airport on friday nights hoping that a 
huge c5 cargo plane would descend onto darkened runway 7 and pull 
up to lockheeds skunk works to pick up classified loads 
dave rockwell a c5 watcher since 1983 was part of a network 
of fanatics who would videotape the c5s as they zoomed in to pick 
up what was assumed to be lockheed stealth fighters so secret they 
officially did not exist 
not so many people show up now rockwell said it only 
comes in about every 10 weeks instead of every four or five weeks 
before

the numbers tell the tale of a changing 
america in the 1980s more golfers and softball players less 
liquor and red meat more opera more imported cars more mail 
more tvwatching more prisoners higher blood pressure 
getting right to the most basic number the census bureau 
estimated the population at 246900000 as of jan 1 1989 thats 
up from the 226545805 tallied in the 1980 national headcount 
these americans can expect to live longer than their 
predecessors life expectancy rose from 737 years in 1980 to 749 
as of 1988 according to the national center for health statistics 
and the shape of those lives is changing judging from a 
snapshot of statistics spanning the decade because of the time it 
takes to compile them some of the latest available statistics are 
for 1986 or 1987 
on the vital statistics front the number of marriages and 
divorces both slipped slightly marriages were down from 2390300 
in 1980 to 2389000 in 1988 while divorces declined from 
1189000 to 1183000 
the numbers of births and deaths rose in 1980 there were 
1989800 deaths reported and 3612000 births in 1988 the deaths 
figure stood at 2171000 and births at 3913000 
recreation boomed in the decade participation in softball grew 
from 30 million people in 1980 to 41 million in 1987 in the same 
period the number of golfers increased from 15 million to 217 
million 
america also offers more beauty parlors today up from 65700 
in 1980 to 73300 in 1986 
and for those needing a touchup there are also more bathrooms 
in 1980 one singlefamily home in four had 2 bathrooms or more 
by 1987 that was up to 38 percent of such homes 
speaking of comfort at home the share of singlefamily 
residences with air conditioning was up from 63 percent to 71 
percent 
in less comfortable circumstances during the 1980s the number 
of people in american prisons skyrocketed from 329821 in 1980 to 
581609 in 1987 
at the same time college enrollment grew only slightly from 
12097000 to 12173000 the average scholastic aptitude test 
scores for collegebound students over those same years rose from 
424 to 430 in verbal skills and from 466 to 476 in math 
in 1980 176 million households less than one in four that 
had a television were served by cable now more than half of tv 
households have cable the national cable television association 
reports 
not everyone is watching mtv however 
the number of opera performances increased from 9391 in 1980 to 
11794 in 1987 with attendance rising from 107 million to 164 
million 
symphony concerts declined slightly during the period from 
22229 to 20059 but attendance increased from 226 million to 
251 million 
the cost of mailing a letter 15 cents in 1980 is 25 cents 
today but the rising price doesnt seem to have discouraged 
letterwriting the postal service carried 602 billion firstclass 
letters in 1980 and 823 billion in 1988 
the value of new car imports rose from 167 billion in 1980 to 
478 billion in 1987 while exports of new cars edged up from 39 
billion to 67 billion in the same period 
americans are drinking less liquor percapita consumption fell 
from 198 gallons in 1980 to 154 gallons last year even so 
significant increases were reported in sales of cordials and 
flavored vodkas according to the distilled spirits council of the 
united states 
consumption of red meat has declined from almost 157 pounds per 
person in 1980 to just 144 pounds in 1987 pork also plummeted 
from 68 to 59 pounds per person 
but the agriculture department says americans ate more fish up 
from 13 pounds in 1980 to almost 15 pounds in 1987 at the same 
time poultry consumption jumped from 50 to 62 pounds 
fresh fruit consumption also rose from 86 to almost 99 pounds 
each and americans are eating more vegetables too up from 73 to 
79 pounds each 
despite healthier habits overall american health indexes are 
not all upbeat the national center for health statistics reports 
that almost 123 of every 1000 americans had high blood pressure in 
1986 up from 114 per thousand in 1980

declining fresh water supplies rising 
irrigation costs and growing populations are jeopardizing global 
food supplies a new worldwatch institute report says 
sandra postel author of the report and vice president of the 
nonprofit washingtonbased research institute says greater 
attention to smallscale irrigation and to rainfed or dryland 
farming could help 
more research into salttolerant and droughtresistant crops 
also would help prepare for a likely future of increased 
shortages and hotter drier climates in some major food areas 
postel says in the report issued saturday 
crucial as they are though these measures are but 
stopgaps she says any hope for balancing the water budgets of 
many countries with rapidly growing populations hinges as much on 
slowing birthrates as it does on improving water productivity 
in countries such as egypt for example the population is 
growing by 1 million every eight months modernizing irrigation 
systems will not be enough 
the struggle for a secure water future will not end until 
societies recognize waters natural limits and begin to bring human 
numbers and demands into line with them postel says 
the institute which is headed by lester r brown is financed 
by private foundations and united nations organizations brown and 
the institutes staff are frequent commentators on global problems 
particularly population growth and environmental threats to the 
world food system 
in september for example brown said there is no surefire way 
to boost global food production enough in the 1990s to keep pace 
with indicated population growth 
brown has chided president bush for continuing the reagan 
administrations policy of refusing us support of the united 
nations population fund and international planned parenthood 
federation 
congress recently approved 15 million for the un population 
fund included in a foreign aid bill bush vetoed the bill on 
grounds the fund aids coercive population planning in china 
including the chance of compulsory abortion or involuntary 
sterilization 
the foreign aid measure was passed again by congress without 
the 15 million for the population fund and was signed by bush 
in her report postel says agricultural irrigation in 1800 
comprised an estimated 20 million acres or an area about the size 
of austria a number of large projects especially in india and 
what is now pakistan boosted the worlds irrigated area by 1900 to 
nearly 120 million acres 
as world population grew from 16 billion to more than 5 
billion over the last 90 years irrigation became a cornerstone of 
global food security she says the higher yields farmers could 
get with controllable water supplies proved vital to feeding the 
millions added to our numbers each year especially as 
opportunities to cultivate new land dwindled 
by 1950 worldwide irrigation nearly doubled to 230 million 
acres it has spread even faster since then rising to around 620 
million acres 
today onethird of the global harvest comes from the 17 
percent of the worlds cropland that is irrigated postel says 
many countries such as china egypt india indonesia israel 
japan north and south korea pakistan and peru rely on such land 
for more than half their domestic food production 
but the irrigation growth rate which averaged 2 percent to 4 
percent a year in the 1960s and in the early 1970s has averaged 
only about 1 percent annually since 1979 far less than the growth 
in world population the per capita irrigated area peaked at 1183 
acres per 1000 people in 1978 then decreased to 1116 acres in 
1987 a drop of 56 percent 
postel cites a number of reasons for the irrigation slowdown 
low prices for food commodities comparatively high energy costs 
and general economic conditions that generally discouraged 
agricultural investments 
should grain prices rise because of diminished global stocks 
a possibility during the 90s investments will almost certainly 
pick up again she says but the poor who suffer most from food 
shortages are unlikely to be able to afford crops at the prices 
needed to inspire suich investments 
thus postel says for the foreseeable future irrigations 
contribution to an expanded food supply will have to come from the 
improvement of existing systems 
meanwhile irrigation is taking an ecological toll of the 
earths resources as each year some 786 cubic miles of water six 
times the annual flow of the mississippi river are taken from 
rivers streams and underground aquifers 
practiced on such a scale irrigation has had a profound 
impact on global water bodies and on the cropland receiving it 
postel says waterlogged and salted lands declining and 
contaminated aquifers shrinking lakes and inland seas and the 
destruction of aquatic habitats combine to hang on irrigation a 
high environmental price

in the waning weeks of a prosperous but 
worryfilled decade for the stock market recession anxieties once 
again are clouding investors outlooks 
all through the long bull market and economic expansion that 
date back to 1982 wall street has been beset by periodic fears of 
an economic downturn 
each one proved to be a false alarm even the market crash of 
1987 which was widely heralded at the time as a portent of gloom 
if not outright doom 
even so the prospect of a recession surfaces in just about any 
discussion of the economy and the markets in the early 1990s the 
federal reserve implicitly has acknowledged the threat with moves 
over the past several months to relax its credit policy by 
encouraging interest rates to decline 
normally when the fed loosens because of a recession its 
bullish for stocks said martin zweig editor of the advisory 
letter zweig forecast in bellmore ny 
the problem or the difference this time is that a 
recession has not likely been discounted yet by the stock market 
many who side with the bullish camp say the current scare has no 
more valid basis than the others that have gripped the financial 
world in recent years 
true they acknowledge corporate profits have been slumping for 
several months and the fourthquarter reports that will be issued 
in early 1990 arent likely to look very pretty either 
but they say earnings have gone through sluggish periods before 
for example in the mid1980s without signaling any 
economywide slump 
furthermore they contend the harbingers of a textbook 
recession simply arent present in the current economic climate 
if they were overenthusiastic businesses would be producing 
more than they could sell causing a big buildup of inventories in 
the pipelines of the economy such excesses would be exerting 
upward pressure on inflation and interest rates 
and the fed would be working to keep the economy from 
overheating by tightening its grip on money and credit 
if the conventional wisdom turns out to be correct no 
recession in the classic sense but simply a slowdown in 1990 the 
stock market at worst should mark time and at best could well be 
surprisingly robust said david eisenberg at sanford c bernstein 
amp co 
stock traders seemed to be reserving judgment on that question 
in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials which 
had climbed 7210 points in the previous week slipped back 1621 
to 273144 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 74 to 
19292 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 88 to 45622 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 13 at 37545 
volume on the big board averaged 15155 million shares a day 
against 16057 million the week before 
one primary force that could contribute to an unconventional 
recession many observers agree is the debt that has built up 
through the 80s particularly in the corporate world and in real 
estate 
many highly leveraged companies will not be able to survive if 
their markets soften said george putnam iii in the advisory 
publication the turnaround letter 
if there is a broadbased recession we will see a significant 
increase in defaults and bankruptcies 
added zweig if the economy were to really hit the skids i 
would expect real estate to be in the vanguard 
recent data show that real estate prices have been easing all 
over the country with the exception of portland and seattle the 
glut which uncle sam has inherited from the savings and loans isnt 
going to help

ibm is cutting 10000 jobs chrysler is 
scrapping a highly touted diversification and mcgrawhill is 
undergoing a drastic reorganization all in the name of raising 
profits 
but when three of americas leading companies take steps like 
these in the space of one week its almost like dumping icewater 
on any illusions that the broader economy is healthy and growing 
stronger 
i think these companies are all gearing up for what is going 
to be a pretty cool climate next year said robert j eggert 
editor of blue chip economic indicators an investment newsletter 
and advisory service in sidona ariz the year ahead of us is 
going to be the slowest growth year weve had since the recession 
of 1982 
the severity of the costcutting and strategy realignments 
announced by international business machines corp chrysler motors 
corp and mcgrawhill inc this past week were rooted partly in 
each companys particular problems 
but they also reflected troubling common elements saturation of 
the us market for computers cars and communications products 
high domestic interest rates that raise the cost of doing business 
and an increasingly tough competition abroad where much of the 
potential for growth exists 
i think the major thrust for the companies taking these 
actions is that the world has become extremely competitive over the 
last five years said lester morris chief executive officer of 
mesirow financial a chicagobased investment firm 
in order to remain competitive they have to slim down and get 
rid of a lot of fat he said i know its a cliche but this is 
a global economy all these companies are competing worldwide 
these strategic corporate retreats come against a background of 
evidence that the us economy which by standard government 
measurements has been growing for more than seven years has 
seriously weakened particularly in the past few months 
the latest signal came friday when the labor department reported 
higher unemployment in november and a sharply lower number of new 
jobs created in october than previously believed 
i think it seems very clear based on the numbers weve seen 
that the economy is slowing considerably said michael moran 
economist at daiwa securities america inc in new york the 
numbers that have been coming in recently suggest something in 
neighborhood of 1 percent to 15 percent growth is likely in the 
fourth quarter even below 1 percent is a possibility 
for ibm once considered a showcase american company with such 
awesome dominance that even japanese computer makers gave it 
grudging respect the 23 billion restructuring was considered a 
sign that big blue finally has faced reality its domestic profits 
havent grown for five years the restructuring will eliminate 
10000 jobs and presumably save ibm 1 billion in annual costs 
in chryslers case the no 3 automaker trashed a strategy begun 
only a few years ago to hedge its future by diversifying into 
other industries it is a strategy that rivals general motors corp 
and ford motor co also embraced increasing speculation that they 
might be rethinking their plans as well 
chrysler said it was seeking a buyer for its technology unit 
which includes the gulfstream aerospace business jet maker and 
electrospace systems defense contractor 
chrysler spent more than 1 billion for those businesses 
proceeds of the sale presumably would help prepare chrysler for the 
staggering costs of revamping its vehicle product line for the 
1990s 
abandoning diversification seemed to mark an admission by 
chrysler that it must concentrate on doing what it knows best 
making automobiles one of the worlds most brutally competitive 
industries 
for mcgrawhill a leading information publishing concern the 
220 million restructuring that will cut 1000 jobs from a 
13700member workforce also reflects the intense competition faced 
by the company mcgrawhill has been considered a possible takeover 
target because of its depressed stock price 
still none of the restructurings announced this past week did 
much for the stock prices of the companies or the broader market 
that was considered a sign of deep investor pessimism about the 
impact of an economic slowdown 
all these things are beginning to mount up said eggert 
its going to seem like a recession in many areas 
in other business an economic news this past week 
the thrift crisis claimed another casualty only this time it 
was a human m danny wall director of the office of thrift 
supervision resigned under pressure the first government official 
to quit in a widening scandal over the mismanagement and lax 
regulation of the nations savings amp loans 
a possible takeover struggle in the oil industry surfaced after 
pennzoil corp announced it had bought 88 percent of chevron corp 
for 21 billion chevron took steps to block a takeover from the 
much smaller pennzoil cash rich from its historic lawsuit 
settlement with texaco inc last year 
airlines slapped passengers with fare increases during the busy 
holiday season major carriers said that starting dec 16 they 
would raise prices of their cheapest tickets between 10 and 20 
although they also will waive advance purchase requirements for a 
time

a new epoch was proclaimed by gorbachev a new world of

gorbachev took power in 1985 the fourth soviet leader in 28 
months and inherited a torpid bureaucracy and failing economy

jolted totalitarianism with glasnost and perestroika

hungary dissolved its communist party and lifted the physical

an east german exodus of 225000 people was the biggest since

system that controlled people by locking them in

opened without a drop of blood shed

while ronald reagan was president the 
reigning cliche was that his impact would last far beyond his years 
and that his legacies would be felt in government well into the 
next century 
his time in office was the reagan revolution his fiscal 
ideas were reaganomics his was the reagan era 
but less than a year later the talk about any lingering 
influence is fading and people instead are discussing the 2 
million reagan got for a couple of speeches in japan the sudden 
graying of his hair and the control his wifes astrologer 
exercised over his life in the white house 
many pillars of the reagan program are crumbling even before 
the recent astonishing upheavals in communist east europe reagan 
had retreated from his evil empire characterization of the 
soviet union 
reagans first official act minutes after he took the oath as 
president was to announce an immediate hiring freeze filling a 
campaign promise this begins the process of restoring our 
economic strength and returning the nation to prosperity he said 
he did restore economic strength using enormous amounts of 
borrowed money to fuel the nation longest peacetime economic 
recovery after a deep recession in 198182 that finally subdued 
inflation 
the hiring freeze itself was a failure the executive branch had 
3971802 civilian and military jobs in 1980 at the end of 
reagans eight years that figure had risen to 5079630 
reagans promise to balance the federal budget was hollow jimmy 
carters deficit in 1980 was 738 billion under reagan that 
fattened to 2211 billion in 1986 even as he preached the need 
for restraint in eight years reagan piled up more red ink than 
all 39 previous presidents combined as the debt went from under 1 
trillion to nearly 3 trillion that is one legacy that will 
survive 
his catastrophic illness insurance plan for the elderly which 
the president proclaimed would protect seniors against a choice 
between bankruptcy and death was law for only a year before 
congress repealed it the pressure was applied by prosperous 
seniors who didnt like the feature of which reagan was proudest 
that it was financed by beneficiaries themselves 
reagan proposed the strategic defense initiative star wars 
as the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age not only 
did that run into opposition from experts who said it would not 
work but in this first postreagan year congress cut 1 billion 
from the administration request 
and where reagan pushed a military buildup there now is a 
proposal by the secretary of defense to cut military spending 
by 180 billion over three years 
other than the deficit the most lasting impact of the reagan 
years may be in the supreme court by appointing justices sandra 
day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy and elevating 
william h rehnquist to chief justice reagan gave the court a 
narrow conservative majority 
but when reagans supporters speak now of his legacy they are 
most likely to speak of the intangibles that served him so well in 
office 
george bush leads an america that has been changed profoundly 
by the reagan revolution wrote burton yale pines of the 
conservative heritage foundation bush he said finds himself 
leading a nation that is much healthier stronger more confident 
more optimistic and even much happier than the nation that reagan 
found himself leading in 1981 
in one category reagan outshone every other president in the 
last half of the 20th century he was unquestionably the bestliked 
of the lot 
more than any other reagan seemed to enjoy being president the 
old actor had the best role of his life and he played it to the 
hilt he looked like a president and that rubbed off on the nation 
with nancy at his side her adoring eyes glued on her husband 
america indulged in its secret fondness for royalty 
never mind that his grasp of the issues was often less than 
sure when he tossed that salute to the marine at the door of his 
helicopter when he addressed the congress when he sat erect in 
the wingback chair in the oval office bantering with other heads of 
state he was the president and there was no mistaking it 
alonzo l hamby a history professor at ohio university has 
written that reagan likely will be remembered as an outstanding 
national cheerleader 
but he also will be remembered as the teflon president in 
the dazzling description coined by rep pat schroeder dcolo 
nothing bad ever stuck to him 
reagan spoke of the renewal of the american spirit and it 
became his banner his legendary and incredible luck began with the 
swearinginceremony the americans who had been held hostage in 
iran were released after 444 days but not until jimmy carter had 
passed from the stage 
he presided smiling and unruffled over an administration noted 
for its ethical problems they ranged all over the lot officials 
abusing civil service rules or misspending government money for 
private travel influencepeddling and buying a department head 
misusing chauffeured government limousines conflicts of interest 
using government personnel for private business the list includes 
the irancontra affair which embarrassed reagan but never dented 
his halo and the hud and savings and loan scandals which didnt 
flower until he returned to california 
reagan seemed to be immune blessed always with an unshakable 
popularity he surmounted national tragedy the 1983 bombing of 
marine headquarters in beirut that killed 241 us servicemen and 
serious problems with his health 
the country was put at ease by reagans awshucks demeanor in 
personal crises after being shot three months in office he 
quipped to nancy that honey i forgot to duck he underwent 
surgery for colon cancer and for skin cancer and to correct a 
problem with his hand and fingers where lyndon johnson after an 
operation gave the nation an undignified look at his scar reagan 
is remembered for his bright grin and an ok sign from his hospital 
window 
george h nash a biographer of herbert hoover predicts reagan 
will be judged a singular statesman and for a reason few of his 
critics understand 
reagan says nash reaffirmed with eloquence the continuing 
validity and vitality of the american dream in this more than in 
any policies or decisions lie his legacy and enduring claim to 
greatness

the new york stock exchange has named general 
motors corp chairman roger smith to head a panel examining stock 
market volatility 
the exchange commissioned the panel shortly after a 190point 
drop in the dow jones 30stock industrial average on oct 13 which 
triggered concerns that computerized program trading had damaged 
market stability and driven away individual investors 
i believe addressing investor concerns in todays increasingly 
competitive global financial marketplace is of great importance to 
our nation at this time smith said thursday in a statement 
the equity and related capital markets are a cornerstone of 
the overall health and growth of our countrys marketdriven 
economy and all americans have a vital interest in their 
continuing ability to play that role he said 
the panel is charged with addressing concerns about volatility 
analyzing the impact of rapid price swings in the market and 
recommend changes 
the nyse said the panel also will include representatives of 
individual and institutional investors higher education equities 
and futures exchanges nyse member firms and nyselisted companies 
the exchange said the panels work is expected to take about six 
months 
big board chairman john j phelan jr said smith has a 
longterm perspective on the interests of corporations and their 
shareholders and the importance to the american economy of 
maintaining strong capital markets for all participants 
the stock exchange last month also imposed curbs during periods 
of volatility that limit program trading and give individual 
investors trading priority and asked member firms to refrain from 
program trading during unsteady times 
the reforms followed the oct 13 drop and a sharp 80point rise 
in the dow average on oct 24

americans took out 334 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in october posting the biggest 
increase in net consumer debt in five months the federal reserve 
board said 
the fed said thursday that consumer credit advanced in october 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 57 percent the sharpest 
increase since a 73 percent gain in may when credit rose 421 
billion 
consumer credit outstanding had risen 23 percent in september 
which was revised upward from the 1 percent increase originally 
reported net loan totals were adjusted from 606 million to 137 
billion 
auto loans which fell 32 percent in september after remaining 
flat in august grew by 11 billion or 45 percent on an annual 
rate in october 
but economists said that because of a lag in approving 
applications and then reporting credit the auto loan figures 
reflected sales made in september not october 
the timing of credit and the sales often dont match up 
said cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill a lexington 
mass forecasting organization 
theres really a rush to get cars into the sales column but 
if you sign an agreement to buy a car you might not actually get 
the credit for another week she said 
automakers had reported that october sales of new cars and light 
trucks were down 141 percent from october 1988 as incentives were 
dropped and newmodel sticker prices rose 
but sales were robust in august and september as consumers were 
lured by endofmodelyear incentives and fears of higher prices 
for 1990 models 
the category of debt that includes credit cards jumped to a 64 
percent annual rate of growth from a 56 percent advance in 
september total revolving debt rose 104 billion compared to a 
904 million gain the previous month 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 
123 billion a 75 percent annual rate of growth compared with a 
gain of 12 million or 73 percent in september 
mobile home debts fell again down 26 million or a 14 percent 
rate of decline these debts had fallen for seven consecutive 
months until rising 53 million in september 28 percent on an 
annual rate 
the various changes left total consumer debt in october at a 
seasonally adjusted 7077 billion

the commerce department has begun a study that 
could lead to an overhaul of an aging radio frequency allocation 
system under siege from cellular telephones pagers and muscular 
new technologies such as highdefinition television 
the national telecommunications and information administration 
part of the commerce department invited public comment thursday on 
the use and management of the radio frequency spectrum as a first 
step towards a study it said will establish the spectrum policy 
foundations that will lead the united states into the 21st 
century 
the study will be the first major examination of the radio 
spectrum since the late 1960s 
the study will address the regulatory process allocations 
alternatives for apportioning spectrum spectrum conservation and 
new technologies and forecasting future spectrum requirements 
new technologies promise more efficient use of the airwaves by 
sharing frequencies without causing interference but federal 
regulators are hampered by the current system which awards blocks 
of space to categories of users regardless of how much or how 
little those blocks ultimately are used 
the head of the commerce department agency janice obuchowski 
said changing technology coupled with explosive growth in 
demand makes spectrum reform more necessary today and potentially 
more feasible than it has been in past years 
there is an increasing demand for airspace to accommodate more 
cellular telephones and new communications devices that are being 
developed such as wristsized pagers and automobile tracking 
equipment 
highdefinition television if it is to become a reality in the 
next decade will need more of the frequency spectrum uhf 
television stations may end up sharing some of their airwaves with 
these new technologies 
the government has been criticized for not using its own 
frequency allocations efficiently and the house is considering a 
bill by rep john dingell dmich that would require the 
government to relinquish frequencies for private use 
the commerce department agency said its study will examine 
possible changes in the current spectrum allocation system 
increased sharing of airwaves between government and private users 
and whether some users may be able to switch to new delivery 
systems such as fiber optic cable 
radio systems with fixed transmitters and receivers could be 
linked by fiber which has vastly greater capacity and needs less 
longdistance amplification in comparision with copper wire or 
coaxial cables 
obuchowski acknowleged that it would be difficult to persuade 
existing users to give way to others and said the agencys 
recommendations if adopted by the federal communications 
commission would not mean radical changes in spectrum 
allocation that could make obsolete billions of dollars worth of 
radio and television equipment 
she said she favored auctions of spectrum for new commercial 
licenses or leases in much the same way the government leases 
public land for grazing or oil exploration 
obuchowski said she hopes to have the study completed next year

a new rule requires that automobile 
manufacturers include a government hotline number in vehicle 
owners manuals to encourage reports of defects by car buyers 
federal highway official announced 
a spokeswoman for a consumer group that has been pushing for the 
rule said the action thursday is a move away from the agencys 
tombstone technology which she said results in action being 
taken only after deaths and injuries occur 
the auto safety hotline in operation since 1975 receives about 
a quarter million calls a year either requesting auto safety 
information or reporting problems 
this requirement will make it easier for consumers to contact 
us to report a safety problem said national highway traffic 
safety administrator jerry r curry 
the rule proscribes three paragraphs that will have to be 
included in manuals for any vehicle manufactured after next sept 
1 including information about the safety agencys powers to order 
defects investigations and recalls but it will note that nhtsa 
cannot get involved in individiaul problems between you your 
dealer or manufacturer 
the tollfree hotline is 18004249393 
curry said the telephone service has recently been upgraded with 
an automated operator system to process requests for recall 
information and handle a larger volume of calls 
formal defects report forms will be sent to drivers who report 
problems 
rosemary dunlap president of motor voters said the new nhtsa 
requirement is a longdelayed response to a petition the consumer 
group filed in may 1987 
she said some manufacturers had opposed the idea of including 
the nhtsa number in their manuals saying it would confuse 
consumers manufacturers also expect problems to be reported 
directly to them 
were very hopeful that this will improve defect reporting 
especially in new vehicles so the agency can catch defects before 
we start seeing tombstone technology ms dunlap said 
its well known that auto defects are radically 
underreported she said

us west inc six foreign companies and the 
soviets plan to build and operate the worlds longest fiberoptic 
phone line a 500 million project that will span the soviet union 
officials announced 
us west a regional phone company based near denver said 
thursday it will form a corporation with the six other firms to 
manage constructon of the line which will have undersea 
connections to denmark italy and japan the same corporation will 
operate the line said us west spokesman ed mattix 
the 9500mile system would include 6000 miles across the 
soviet union basically following the route of the transsiberian 
railroad the line will connect denmark and italy with moscow and 
japan to vladivostok in the eastern soviet union 
construction would take three to five years and may begin by 
mid1990 mattix said 
the seven companies will work with the soviet ministy of posts 
and telecommunications to form the transsoviet line development 
corp 
construction will begin after the companies and the soviet 
government have reached agreements on a business structure and 
received government approvals he said 
western governments now restrict the export of the technology 
involved in the fiberoptic line because of its possible strategic 
value mattix said 
governments of the countries involved will review the plans and 
will have to approve them before the project could proceed he said 
other companies involved in the venture are kousai denshin denwa 
of japan societa finanziaria telefonica of italy british telecom 
plc otc of australia the deutsche bundespost telekom of west 
germany and great nordic telegraph co and telecom of denmark 
fiberoptic cables use strands of glass as thin as hair to 
transmit phone calls and data communications in the form of bursts 
of laser light they are far more efficient and handle a far 
greater number of calls than traditional copper cables 
the line would carry international phone calls as well as 
longdistance phone calls within the soviet union officials said 
the project was announced thursday by dick callahan president 
of us west diversified group and gg kudriavtzev first deputy of 
the soviet ministry 
forming the corporation is the next step in our efforts to 
constuct this major telecommunications link the two said

the slowing of the economy has some analysts 
at odds over whether a recession is on the horizon and federal 
reserve policymakers looking to give the economy a boost without 
exacerbating inflation 
whether the fed will seek to nudge interest rates lower again 
before the end of the year is the subject of much debate among 
financial analysts and most agree that todays unemployment report 
from the labor department will heavily influence the feds course 
financial markets drifted thursday as most traders awaited 
todays data the first comprehensive look at the economys 
performance in november 
if job growth was sluggish the central bank is expected to ease 
its hold on credit for the sixth time since march in an effort to 
spur the economy a strong report likely will persuade the fed to 
hold tight and await further data on economic growth and inflation 
as the year draws to a close 
analysts contacted in advance of the reports release were split 
on whether it would bring an easing from the fed 
it will show that the general slowdown in the economy 
continues and in fact the fed might want to ease further on these 
numbers said kathleen stephansen senior economist at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp the prime concern has shifted 
away from inflation and onto the overall state of the economy 
she predicted the labor department would report an addition of 
120000130000 new nonfarm payroll jobs last month with the 
civilian unemployment rate either holding steady at 53 percent or 
perhaps climbing slightly to 54 percent 
but roger brinner of drimcgraw hill predicted the fed would 
just hold tight if the report was in line with his companys 
prediction of 125000 new jobs last month 
brinner said the jobs number will be artificially deflated by 
about 60000 because the labor departments survey was taken in a 
week in which boeing corp workers were on strike 
our view is that the federal reserve is not pleased with 
inflation said brinner adding that the economy while growing 
at a slower pace does not appear at risk of toppling into 
recession 
were running in the middle gears right now and any further 
downshifts to low or as some people fear reverse are yet to 
come he said 
concurring with that view was washington economist michael 
evans who predicted the report would show 150000 new jobs last 
month 
i think the fed is just going to sit tight evans said 
the economy has pulled out of whatever was ailing it at the 
beginning of the year and inflation is still rearing its head if 
growth and inflation are both up thats not when you ease 
the october report was comparatively strong with the government 
reporting the creation of 233000 jobs in the nonfarm sector for 
the past six months the monthtomonth gains have averaged 203000 
well below last years average of more than 300000 
for the past six months the jobless rate has changed only 
slightly three of those months it was 52 percent the other three 
53 percent

the justice departments probe of savings and 
loan fraud will get 400 more investigators to look into what 
attorney general dick thornburgh says may be the nations biggest 
whitecollar swindle 
thornburgh announced thursday that the additional prosecutors 
fbi agents and accountants will be assigned to 27 cities where most 
of the savings and loan fraud cases are being investigated 
the additional manpower is being financed by a 485 million 
appropriation by congress as part of legislation to tighten 
regulations on the scandalplagued thrift industry 
wrongdoing in the savings and loan industry may turn out to be 
the biggest whitecollar swindle in the history of our nation 
the attorney general told reporters 
the departments dallas savings and loan task force which has 
already obtained 46 convictions will double in size with 37 more 
fbi agents and 12 assistant us attorneys thornburgh said 
asked today on abcs good morning america to what extent 
blame for sampl fraud could be placed on deregulation of the 
industry thornburgh said i think the type of operator that was 
involved in these ripoffs would have not been deterred by the 
regulatory apparatus 
he said the best estimates are that about 25 percent one 
dollar out of four of the losses that eventually are going to have 
to be picked up by the taxpayers was due to criminal activity 
overall losses in the sampl industry have been estimated at up to 
160 billion 
i think it would be misleading to think that there will be any 
substantial recovery thornburgh said most of these funds have 
been frittered away 
marvin collins us attorney in dallas said much of the fraud 
in the texas sampl industry would have happened anyway the cowboys 
we prosecuted were going to act without regard to whether there was 
regulation collins said 
the justice department is pursuing about 8000 cases of bank and 
savingsandloan fraud ranging from embezzlements by tellers to 
fraud committed by top executives said justice department 
spokesman david runkel 
if laws are firmly enforced they will provide a deterrent to 
future criminal activity the attorney general said 
up to this point because of the number of cases and the 
shortage of resources we have not been able to mount the type of 
effort i have outlined he said 
in addition to dallas thornburgh announced the assignment of 27 
fbi agents and 15 more prosecutors to los angeles 10 fbi agents 
and five prosecutors to kansas city 12 agents and five prosecutors 
to new orleans 10 fbi agents and four prosecutors to oklahoma 
city and 10 agents and four prosecutors to new york 
another 27 agents and 14 prosecutors will be assigned to houston

some financially troubled borrowers who 
cheated the farmers home administration avoided foreclosure by 
taking advantage of debt settlement measures intended for borrowers 
who acted in good faith officials say 
the fmha estimates 330 badfaith borrowers paid off their debt 
or bought back foreclosed farms through provisions in the 1987 
agricultural credit act 
sen kent conrad dnd has sponsored a senateapproved bill 
to limit the debtrestructuring program to farmers who acted 
properly 
a general accounting office fact sheet given to conrad last week 
lists examples of eight borrowers in one unspecified county office 
who benefited from the program despite cheating fmha by selling 
collateral hiding income or paying other creditors more than 
necessary 
one farmer who is eligible for the program had 91284 in his 
checking account while he was 76269 past due on fmha loans 
were not talking about a big thing but obviously we dont 
want those who acted in bad faith to get the benefits of the 
legislation and that was clearly congress intent when they passed 
the agricultural credit act said conrad chairman of the 
senates agricultural credit subcommittee 
fmha would actually lose some money by foreclosing on those 
borrowers but the agency estimates a net savings of 10 million 
because other farmers would be discouraged from cheating conrad 
said 
i think it is really an issue of assuring taxpayers that the 
system is going to operate in a way that assures that those who 
havent operated in good faith dont get the benefits of the 
agricultural credit act conrad said 
the senate passed conrads bill shortly before congress 
adjourned last month the house has taken no action on the measure 
which is backed by fmha 
we are in favor of anything that will enable us to collect 
reasonable debts on a reasonable basis that conrads bill is a 
step in the right direction agriculture department spokesman 
john kislak said thursday 
fmha is often called the governments farm lender of last resort 
because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify at banks or 
other commercial sources 
with loan delinquencies rising in 1987 congress forced fmha to 
write down loans or spread out payments whenever that would cost 
the government less than foreclosure 
badfaith borrowers have taken advantage of a provision under 
which farmers who dont qualify for restructuring can buy out of 
their debt at the adjusted value of their collateral according to 
the gao report 
in one location borrowers who engaged in multiple instances 
of bad faith bought out their loans that way the gao said 
another provision badfaith borrowers have used gives them the 
option to purchase or lease land the fmha took from them in 
foreclosure 
among the examples of borrowers who cheated fmha were 
a farmer who sold farm equipment that was fmha security 
equipment and had another family member sell additional equipment 
none of the money was applied to the farmers 626000 in fmha debt 
a farmer who borrowed money from other lenders for farm 
equipment fmha had told him he didnt need the farmer repaid those 
loans and even made advanced principal payments on them while 
becoming delinquent on 187000 in fmha debt 
a farmer who claimed a son had not made rental payments on his 
farm even though the borrower was current or ahead on payments to 
other creditors

united airlines machinists who have opposed 
recent plans to take over the airlines parent company say they 
havent seen anything to change their minds in the latest 
managementworker buyout proposal 
the machinists will oppose any transaction that would unduly 
put the company at risk as the last proposal did said brian 
freeman an adviser to the machinists union representing about 
25000 ual employees 
freeman said thursday that the union would not participate in 
any buyout that includes current senior management of ual 
ual management has not met with machinists union leaders on the 
new buyout proposal nor set a date for a meeting freeman said 
although some managers have met with other employee unions 
neither officials at the parent of united airlines nor leaders of 
the airlines labor unions have offered many details 
analysts say ual management is seeking ironclad commitments from 
lenders and the companys three major unions before publicly 
announcing the particulars of its revised buyout effort 
but one union official said thursday the failure of a previous 
bid was prompting uals discretion 
the earlier buyout proposal accepted by uals board a 
300ashare 675 billion deal involving ual management the 
7000member united chapter of the air line pilots association and 
british airways plc collapsed in october when lenders refused to 
finance it 
one factor in banks wariness of financing the deal was the 
continued opposition of the machinists 
a number of people were embarrassed with the failure of the 
first esop proposals most of the parties want to avoid that 
said carol holmes the outgoing vice president of the 14000member 
united airlines unit of the association of flight attendants 
ual officials presented a revised employee buyout proposal to 
officials of the flight attendants union on wednesday holmes 
refused to provide details of the proposal but said she would 
outline it for union members 
meetings between ual management and its 70000 employees will 
continue for some time said ual spokesman rob doughty he 
described the meetings as roundtable discussions during which 
employees are asked for ideas on the buyout proposal 
its our policy not to discuss matters that would affect the 
value or trading of our stock he said refusing to divulge 
details of the plan 
it also has long been our policy not to discuss labor 
negotiations he said noting the proposal addresses some issues 
that usually are covered in union contracts 
industry analysts say they believe the revised management buyout 
plan will value ual at 210 to 240 a share or a total of 475 
billion to 542 billion 
ual stock traded at 17650 a share at midday today down 50 
cents from thursdays close on the new york stock exchange

during recent congressional testimony that 
disclosed private pension fund fraud many americans may have felt 
reassured because their nest egg is protected in a socalled 
guaranteed investment contract 
maybe they shouldnt breathe so easily 
those guaranteed contracts often used as part of 401 k 
retirement savings plans are not ironclad the only guarantee 
behind them is the belief that the issuer is of sufficient 
financial strength to keep paying the contracts fixed rate of 
interest 
despite their name chances are no government agency would step 
in to make good should a sponsor of the contracts typically an 
insurance company hit the skids 
many insurance companies put their money in junk bonds risky 
mortgages and other investments that may give an investor pause 
the degree to which they are involved in risky investments is 
reflected in the credit rating they receive from creditrating 
agencies 
most of the companies in this market we have rated aa or 
higher which would suggest that the guarantee is pretty good 
very good actually said weston hicks a vice president at 
moodys investors service inc a creditrating agency that ranks 
companies on a scale of aaa to c 
but he said theres really no protection per se if a 
company issuing a guaranteed investment contract or gic goes 
under 
there has never been a gic default but hicks said there are 
differences in creditworthiness that an investor should consider 
between an insurance company rated aaa and one rated aa or lower 
gics exploded in popularity with the growth of 401 k plans 
which are companysponsored programs that allow employees to put 
away a portion of their income in a savings fund and defer income 
taxes on it until the money is withdrawn at retirement when it is 
taxed at a lower rate 
the 401 k plans have mushroomed as many smaller companies have 
dropped companysponsored pension plans these companies say the 
federal rules that govern pension plans make them too complex and 
costly for small businesses 
employees often have a choice of several investment options for 
their 401 k savings including gics and various stock or bond 
mutual funds many 401 k plans spread the funds among several 
gics thereby reducing the risk to the savings should there be a 
gic default 
the advantages of gics are that they pay a steady rate of 
interest and the principal is fixed with some mutual funds 
principal can deteriorate depending on market conditions while the 
rate of interest is never guaranteed 
gics typically pay interest rates that exceed the yields on 
treasury bills and money market funds by 05 to 15 percentage 
points 
the total amount of money invested in gics exceeds 150 billion 
industry officials estimate 
hank madden an ids securities corp financial planner in 
jacksonville fla said that as tightly regulated as the 
insurance industry is investors should have little to worry 
about with gics 
thus far the insurance industry since the great depression 
has had a pretty good track record of making those guarantees come 
about he said 
even when insurance companies have had financial trouble the 
investors holding annuities and other investments in them have not 
been burnt he said mentioning the bankruptcy reorganization of 
baldwinunited corp several years ago as an example 
however hicks said all is not well in the insurance industry 
today 
theres clearly been a deterioration in the insurance 
industrys credit quality over the past few years he said 
in addition he said the gic market is highly competitive and 
insurance companies are writing this business at quite thin 
spreads in order to make it profitable they have to put a lot of 
liabilities on their books

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade 
wheat prices came under pressure from selling that continued 
from thursdays weak close the market was expected to get some 
support from reports that egypt and the soviet union would be 
targeted for additional wheat under the export bonus program 
good export sales figures released thursday by the us 
department of agriculture were expected to give support to corn 
futures and reports spain may be in the market for one million 
metric tons of corn also might boost prices said analyst william 
biedermann of allendale inc in chicago 
soybean futures were under pressure from reports planting is 
progressing smoothly in south america and the existance of 
shipping problems along the mississippi river

were cent to 1 cents lower with january 574 a bushel 
livestock futures were mixed and pork futures lower in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
pork belly futures were down the limit due to followthrough

prices

a temple spokesman said the new bid which was extended to dec

government benefits to elderly and disabled 
poor people were incorrectly cut off in more than half the 
suspension cases reviewed by the social security administration 
the agency reported today 
a study found that agency workers were cutting off supplemental 
security income welfare benefits without giving recipients adequate 
time and assistance to prove their ongoing eligibility for the 
program 
ssi provides a minimum income floor to 45 million lowincome 
aged blind and disabled people maximum monthly benefits are 368 
for an individual and 553 for a couple they will rise to 386 for 
an individual and 579 for a couple on jan 1 
the study found that the number of ssi beneficiaries whose 
benefits were suspended for failure to cooperate with the agencys 
efforts to monitor eligibility rose from 80000 in 1987 to 105000 
in 1988 
i am appalled to learn that thousands of frail elderly blind 
or disabled americans were thrown off the rolls for no good 
reason said sen david pryor dark chairman of the senate 
special committee on aging when an ssi recipient is cut off it 
can lead to homelessness starvation or exploitation 
an internal review of 1293 suspension cases found that benefits 
were incorrectly cut off in 54 percent of the cases and that the 
suspensions were justified but incorrectly recorded in an 
additional 30 percent of the cases 
social security spokesman phil gambino said the agency was 
extremely concerned about the findings because they do show 
were suspending ssi payments which go to some of the most 
vulnerable people the elderly and disabled 
this can cause very serious problems for these people who are 
living on very limited incomes gambino said 
in response to the report the social security administration in 
late november issued a directive to field offices cautioning that 
workers must be careful to make sure that ssi benefits are not 
improperly suspended for failure to provide information 
failure to follow these instructions can result in serious 
problems for the individuals served by the ssi program the memo 
said 
employees were reminded that recipients must be given 30 days to 
respond to requests for information about their financial status 
and that an extension may be granted to those who have difficultly 
providing requested information 
in addition the memo said recipients who have difficulty 
complying with the requests because of advanced age disability or 
homelessness should receive a followup contact by telephone or in 
person before benefits are suspended

overriding british objections leaders 
of the european community today agreed to open a special conference 
late next year to press their plans for a tight economic and 
monetary union 
the decision on the opening day of a twoday summit in this 
historic city on the german border paves the way for the community 
to revise its founding treaty and adopt radical plans that would 
lead to a joint currency and europeanwide central bank system 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has been an outspoken 
opponent of the sweeping proposals to make major changes in the way 
in which the nations conduct economic and monetary policies 
but we expected this said a british official demanding 
anonymity it was a lowkey discussion and a decision they were 
perfectly entitled to take 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who had earlier appeared 
hesitant under french pressure for an early conference sealed the 
deal when he told his colleagues he would back the 1990 date 
our essential position is that the community must advance 
he was quoted as saying by french presidential spokesman hubert 
vedrine 
we must now complete the work in a way that the italian 
presidency convokes and opens the intergovernmental conference in 
december 1990 we must take a decision in this sense today kohl 
was quoted as saying 
under the communitys rotating presidency italy will hold the 
top spot for the last six months of 1990 
italys prime minister guilio andreotti said the conference 
will be convoked and opened in the second half of 1990 we 
dont need to fix the exact date his remarks were quoted by 
vedrine 
treaty changes are needed to bring about monetary union under a 
central bank and a single currency for the community of 320 million 
people 
but the issue is controversial with britain opposing monetary 
union and arguing it is premature to discuss changing the treaty 
when the ec has not decided on what monetary union means or 
involves 
west germany urged today that the community nations yield some 
national sovereignty over economic policy to the 518member 
european parliament now largely an advisory body 
british opposition to monetary union is based largely on prime 
minister margaret thatchers reluctance to yield national political 
sovereignty to a communitywide body 
on the summits eve west germany said it did not want to start 
the treaty amendment talks in 1990 as french president francois 
mitterrand is seeking 
however france and west germany appeared to have reached a 
compromise to launch the conference formally in december 1990 but 
stipulating it would not start work until early 1991 kohl had 
wanted to defer the conference until after west german elections 
scheduled for dec 9 1990 
at the start of the summit enrique baron president of the 
european parliament urged the ec to expand his assemblys powers 
the european parliament must be able to initiate 
legislation baron a spanish socialist told the ec leaders 
he also appealed for a quickening of west european integration 
we consider it necessary to accelerate the process of european 
unification 
mrs thatcher seeking to focus the summit on the ecs response 
to the upheaval in eastern europe was putting forward a new policy 
paper 
it envisages the community devising relations of varying 
closeness with east european nations depending on how far each 
advances toward democracy thatcher aides said 
the ec is to become a barrierfree single market at the end of 
1992 
the summit opened just days after us president george bush 
urged the west europeans to accelerate integration and to act as a 
magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in eastern 
europe 
the leaders were also debating a proposed social charter 
setting out ecwide labor union rights wages and welfare after 
1992 britain also opposes the charter arguing that it will 
increase production costs and unemployment and make the community 
less competitive 
the social charter would not be binding but its adoption goes 
to the heart of the political controversy within the ec

chevron corp the nations fourthlargest 
oil company said today it had sued pennzoil co and taken other 
defensive steps following pennzoils disclosure it had bought 88 
percent of chevrons stock 
in two other moves designed to deter a possible hostile 
takeover chevron stepped up its shareholder rights takeover 
defense which enables stockholders to buy more shares at bargain 
prices and lined up a new 5 billion credit agreement with banks 
our board believes that pennzoils acquisition of chevron 
shares is disruptive and represents a threat to the realization of 
our longterm business objectives kenneth t derr chevron 
chairman and chief executive said in a news release 
houstonbased pennzoil disclosed thursday in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission that it paid 21 billion to buy 
315 million chevron shares 88 percent of the total outstanding 
over the past three months 
pennzoil also said it may spend 500 million more on chevron 
shares the entire 26 billion net proceeds it received last year 
in settling a lawsuit against texaco inc it said the purchases 
were for investment purposes and had no interest in acquiring 
chevron 
but chevron said today it had sued pennzoil in us district 
court here accusing it of violating federal securities laws in 
failing to disclose important information about its purposes in 
buying chevron stock 
the suit seeks to force pennzoil to sell the chevron shares 
which the san franciscobased company claims were purchased 
illegally 
chevron also said it had amended the trigger point for the 
companys stockholder rights plan so it would be activated if 
anyone acquired 10 percent of outstanding shares down from 20 
percent the change is intended to deter anyone from acquiring 10 
percent or more of the company without the approval of chevrons 
board of directors 
chevron also said it had set up a new 5 billion credit 
arrangement with banks in the united states and throughout the 
world and that all banks involved have agreed not to knowingly 
finance purchases of chevron stock by third parties 
the chevron board of directors is committed to fulfilling 
chevrons longterm goals and will take all actions necessary to 
accomplish that end derr said he said it was in the interests 
of shareholders employees customers and the nation that chevron 
remain an independent public company 
responding to the latest development pennzoil chairman j hugh 
liedtke reiterated that pennzoils stake in chevron was acquired 
as a longterm investment and that pennzoil has no interest in 
attempting to take over chevron we will of course make an 
appropriate response in to course to the litigation filed by 
chevron 
pennzoils disclosure thursday deflated the price of chevron 
stock which had been rising on takeover speculation chevron lost 
525 to close at 6675 in composite trading on the new york stock 
exchange pennzoil meanwhile rose 625 cents to 8325 
in trading at midday chevron was up 37 cents a share at 
6712 while pennzoil climbed 250 a share to 8575 
the disclosure ended months of speculation about who was buying 
so many of chevrons shares 
industry observers also had been watching closely to see what 
pennzoil would do with its windfall from the texaco settlement 
which was cut to about 400 million in legal bills 
texaco paid pennzoil 3 billion over pennzoils claims that 
texaco illegally interfered in pennzoils planned purchase of getty 
oil co in 1984 in 1985 a houston jury awarded pennzoil 103 
billion texaco appealed but eventually settled with pennzoil for 
the smaller amount 
this position has been acquired as a longterm investment 
pennzoil said pennzoil has no interest in attempting to take 
over chevron 
only wednesday chevron announced a 1 billion sale of 141 
million shares of its common stock to an employee stock ownership 
plan that could make any takeover more difficult the stock about 
5 percent of the companys outstanding shares was added to 11 
percent already held by an employee profitsharing plan

the malta summit not only may have symbolized 
another high point in superpower relations but also was the 
pinnacle so far for a tie retailing newcomer to the united states 
tie rack got a pleasant surprise when president bush sported its 
glasnosttie at a joint news conference with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev after the talks concluded last sunday 
the chain owned by a company that bills itself as the worlds 
biggest necktie retailer opened its first us store two years 
ago and it couldnt have hoped for a better attention getter and 
the timing was perfect 
the holidays are the most important time for retailers of any 
stripe and ties are a christmas present standby pundits have 
predicted this year will be a pennypinching christmas as shoppers 
hunt for inexpensive gifts with accessories high on their lists 
being able to boast about bush wearing one of his companys ties 
was a welcome change for roy bishko chairman of the british parent 
company tie rack plc who last month had to explain some 
disappointing financial results 
in an interview this week the breathlessly fasttalking bishko 
brimmed with enthusiasm about his concept of bringing affordable 
highquality neckwear to the masses his eyes gleamed as he 
lovingly displayed the latest designs at a tie rack store in 
midtown manhattan one of 41 the company operates in the united 
states 
ties are important to me bishko proclaimed 
bishko said the idea of founding tie rack was borne out of his 
frustration at not being able to afford a nice silk tie plus he 
thought it was a merchandising mistake for ties to be relegated to 
tiny sections in mens departments of big stores 
thus tie racks compact little stores are located in 
hightraffic areas typically along a route that commuters take 
going to and from work such as new yorks grand central station 
they overflow with a bright broad assortment ranging from 
funky bold patterns to staid stripes starting at around 15 and 
going up past 60 a piece the stores also stock scarves shawls 
floppy bow ties and other neckwear for women silkytextured 
polyester scarves can be bought for under 10 while real silk 
scarves range from 26 to 150 
through an arrangement with the paisley museum in scotland tie 
rack has access to old designs and adapts them for neckwear its 
designers also cull ultramodern patterns from popular culture 
including hollywood films and work with contemporary artists 
on the glasnost tie presented to bush earlier this year and to 
various world leaders last year there are miniature reproductions 
of american and soviet flags and a dove of peace the background is 
dark blue tie rack commissioned it from londons st martin 
college of art and royalties on its sales go to a british cancer 
charity 
bishko a south african native who emigrated to england in the 
early 1970s had limited experience in retailing before he founded 
tie rack in 1981 he was working in property and finance at the 
time 
i must say i am selftaught in retailing said 44yearold 
bishko 
his specialty retailing idea captivated investors when the 
company went public in britain in the summer of 1987 the initial 
public offer of tie rack stock drew 85 times the number of 
potential takers it could accomodate 
but more recently investors might consider tie rack to be a pain 
in the neck the stock has been trading at around 50 pence a share 
lately down from 145 pounds when the stock was floated 
the stock which isnt traded in the united states was battered 
last month when tie rack reported an unexpectedly poor performance 
for the first half of the year in the 28 weeks ended aug 13 tie 
rack lost 272000 pounds compared with a profit of 374000 pounds a 
year earlier 
the cost of us expansion and tie racks slow progress in the 
united states were cited as causes of its troubles in addition to 
the united states the companys 220 stores are in the united 
kingdom ireland canada australia france the netherlands and 
norway 
outside this country tie racks typically are operated as 
franchises and bishko said the company eventually will sell 
franchises here now all us stores are companyowned and run 
bishko said he is undaunted and will continue to try and foster 
awareness here of his company which is billed as the worlds 
biggest neckwear retailer with more than 100 million in sales last 
year financial analysts he said are too preoccupied with the 
shortterm 
other british retailers catering to small market niches have had 
success in exporting their concept here and tie rack probably wont 
be an exception sock shop stores and body shops selling 
allnatural health and beauty aids both have set up us 
operations and found plenty of eager american customers 
we regard america as a longterm investment bishko said 
im sure the share price will look after itself in due course

giving a tie as a christmas gift may seem like a 
cliche but the neckwear association of america thinks knot 
the holiday season is the busiest time of year for all retailers 
and ties move fastest then too the neckwear association a trade 
group for the nearly 1 billion industry estimates that 100 
million ties will be sold this year in the united states and about 
20 million of them will be bought as holiday gifts the fact that 
there are that many ties sold year in and year out indicates that 
ties are a very popular gift said gerald andersen the groups 
executive director 
retailers say ties are a good choice because shoppers dont have 
to worry about sizes ties retailers say have one of the lowest 
return rates for any apparel category 
this year andersen said the tie business is expected to be 
very strong because ties are bolder and more exciting than they 
have been in years and consumers are really responding 
to help gift givers make the right selection the association 
offers the following tips 
buy one that fits the receivers tastes not yours this is 
probably the most common mistake in buying a tie gift andersen 
says 
get to know someones wardrobe before buying the person a tie 
take note of color preferences and choose a complementing tie 
if someone favors a particular designer or clothing 
manufacturer look for a tie of the same make 
consider a persons interests ties that reflect hobbys are a 
safe bet such as a tie dotted with tiny golf balls for an avid 
golfer 
choose a tie that is in fashion 
ties are wider this year with the most popular widths being 3 
inches to 3 inches some designers are moving to a 4inch shape 
popular patterns are bold looks inspired by the 1940s and early 
1950s as well as european themes are hot paisleys in rich colors 
are selling well silk printed neckwear is still a favorite but 
woven neckwear is gaining a following 
the present power tie is one with a jacquard overprint 
meaning a design printed on a solid color patterned background

boeing co officials announced friday they are 
forming a division to develop a new widebody plane that could 
become the 777 
the new jet will be larger than an existing 767 but smaller than 
the familiar 747 model 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton said the 
company is going ahead and developing the plane and making first 
offers to airlines but thornton said no airlines have yet offered 
to buy the plane and boeing is far from committed to actually 
building it 
neither thornton nor phil condit boeing commercial airplanes 
executive vice president would say how much it would cost boeing 
to develop the new plane although thornton said it would be in the 
billions of dollars 
condit estimated the new plane would sell for slightly less than 
100 million 
speculation about a new boeing jet model has focused on the role 
japanese companies might have in its development thornton said 
boeing has been talking to three japanese companies but that no 
contract has been signed 
if enough airlines agree to buy it the new jet would go into 
production as the 777 until now talk about such a new jet has 
referred to it as a 767x 
thornton said the new plane would be smaller and have a shorter 
range than the 747 jumbo jet but would be larger than boeings 
other widebody the 767 
condit said boeing envisions the plane as having capacity for 
about 350 passengers it initially would be marketed as a 
replacement for the lockheed l1011 and the mcdonnell douglas 
dc10 which are mainly used on longdistance domestic routes 
many of those competing planes have been in service since the 
mid1970s and will be 20 years old by 1995 when boeing hopes to 
introduce the new models condit said 
boeing later would like to offer an international version of the 
777 capable of transatlantic and transpacific flight said 
condit who has been named general manager of the new division 
which will develop the jet 
condit said boeing will use many of its existing facilities to 
build the plane but expects it would require a new assembly line 
probably at boeings existing widebody plant at everett wash 
the plane would be a twinengine jet that boeing hopes will be 
able to accommodate essentially the same twoman cockpit as the 767 
the seating would range from six to 10 across in two fare 
classes

representatives of consumer groups met friday 
with chairman janet steiger of the federal trade commission to 
discuss a variety of issues on which they want the ftc to adopt a 
higher profile 
ms steiger who assumed leadership of the regulatory agency 
last spring said the informal session was intended to sound out 
issues of key interest to consumer organizations in the 1990s also 
taking part in the meeting was commissioner andrew j strenio jr 
bruce silverglade of the center for science in the public 
interest said his group wanted the ftc to work together more 
closely with state attorneys general and treat the state officials 
as full partners in developing consumer protection measures 
theres enough work for everybody at both the federal and 
state levels silverglade said 
he added that despite various deregulation moves undertaken 
since the late 1970s the american public has never really 
supported a broad deregulation of consumer protection 
another official of the washingtonbased center michael 
jacobson said the ftc should take a more active role in regulating 
advertising by the alcoholic beverages industry 
he noted that problem drinkers cost american industry about 135 
billion a year in lost productivity 
jacobson said the ftc should support legislation to require 
health warning notices on print liquor ads equal air time for 
publicservice messages about the risks of drinking and elimination 
of advertising targeted at young people 
matthew l myers a representative of the coalition for smoking 
or health urged that the ftc take a hard look at advertising by 
the tobacco industry for new products such as nonicotine 
cigarettes and cigarettes designed to produce less secondary smoke 
bothersome to nonsmokers in the same room 
unless such advertising is very closely regulated meyers said 
the american consumer is likely to be misled falsely 
believing that he or she is avoiding the very real health risks of 
smoking 
eileen kugler speaking on behalf of another washingtonbased 
group public voice for food amp health policy said the ftc should 
push for measures to to ensure that food advertising particularly 
health claims made for various products is not deceptive or 
misleading 
the ftc of the last decade has virtually ignored this crucial 
area of consumer protection she said 
ms kugler noted that even as consumers are being told to be 
more careful about what we eat they have less ability to do so as 
consumption of highly processed foods has increased consumers have 
less knowledge and understanding about what is actually in the 
food

the former head of a wall street brokerage that 
collapsed in the wake of the october 1987 market crash was 
convicted friday of manipulating the prices of overthecounter 
securities 
a federal jury found eugene laff 52 former chairman of haas 
securities corp guilty of five charges conspiracy two counts 
of stock manipulation mail fraud and obstruction of a securities 
and exchange commission investigation

a 250000 fine on each of the five counts when sentenced feb 15

investment company and stanley aslanian a former haas trader and 
president 
both lorin and aslanian pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors in the laff case

inflate prices his attorney blamed the scheme on lorin and 
aslanian

customers who testified that they lost their life savings when the 
company collapsed 
haas securities was a 75yearold firm that had 12000 customers 
before going out of business nine days after the crash when it no 
longer had enough capital to stay afloat

loral corp pleaded guilty friday to 
charges it tried to improperly influence the award of two defense 
contracts by obtaining confidential data from key pentagon 
officials 
loral which agreed to pay 577 million in fines penalties and 
reimbursement for the cost of the investigation pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy conversion of government property and filing a false 
statement 
the new yorkbased defense contractor admitted charging the 
pentagon 578000 it paid under bogus consulting arrangements to 
william m galvin a defense consultant who was actually hired to 
influence the award of contracts for a radar detection device and a 
navy blimp 
victor d cohen then deputy assistant air force secretary gave 
galvin inside information that was relayed to loral according a 
statement of facts that the company admitted 
melvyn paisley an assistant navy secretary for research 
engineering and systems who went into business with galvin in 1987 
also assisted lorals unsuccessful efforts to get the blimp 
contract the court papers said 
cohen was to personally benefit from the information he gave 
loral according to a description of the conspiracy to which the 
company pleaded court papers also indicated that cohen split some 
of the money that loral paid galvin in return for his cooperation 
neither cohen galvin nor paisley has been charged in the 
investigation of pentagon procurement fraud known as operation 
ill wind 
lorals guilty plea before us district judge claude m hilton 
is the fourth by a corporation in the defensefraud probe 
cohens attorney julian greenspun called the allegations about 
his client absolute baloney greenspun said mr cohen never 
took a dime in connection with any official action 
e lawrence barcella who represents paisley said his clients 
actions while assistant secretary of the navy were always 
appropriate legitimate and legal 
through galvin cohen gave loral details of a competing bid by 
litton systems inc to provide advanced radar warning devices 
designed to warn pilots of f16 fighters that an enemy missile has 
been fired against the aircraft 
cohen also gave galvin results of tests the air force conducted 
on the competing radar proposals submitted by loral and litton the 
court papers said 
paisley used his official position to help a division of 
goodyear tire and rubber co which was purchased by loral in 1987 
obtain the blimp contract the papers said 
paisley changed the bid requirements in accordance with the 
goodyear divisions desire to build a smaller airship than the navy 
originally sought he also made other bid modifications favorable 
to the goodyear division according to the statement of facts 
after leaving the navy paisley relayed information he had 
obtained from a highlevel navy official that lorals 140 million 
bid to build the airship was 25 percent higher than the proposal by 
westinghouse corp 
the pentagon said in a statement the overall settlement will 
assure the integrity of the competitive process avoid substantial 
cost to the government and meet the air force operational need on 
the original schedule 
the air force the statement said considered many 
alternatives including terminating its contract with loral but 
that terminating it and starting over would have cost 300 to 
400 million and would have delayed the probram by three to four 
years 
in a statement loral said it had suspended two individuals and 
disciplined two others 
the company declined to identify those individuals but a source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that loral had 
suspended louis h oberndorf a senior vice president of its 
electronic systems subsidiary in yonkers ny and fred r 
nebiker a senior vice president of the defense subsidiary 
this regrettable incident should not have occurred at loral 
said bernard l schwartz the companys chairman and chief 
executive officer we are satisfied that loral has procedures and 
controls in place to provide the best protection from anything like 
this occurring again 
loral has agreed to give up profits on the basic contract 
originally priced at 433 million and will assume a greater share 
of cost overruns the air force estimated the changes will save the 
government 45 million to 65 million the justice department 
said 
a 705 million option for the 1992 fiscal year is also being 
removed from the contract loral must compete with second sources 
for that procurement the justice department said 
the companys plea was entered after a former sperry corp 
official admitted approving bribes to former navy procurement 
official garland l tomlin jr 
james j thompson former general manager of sperrys 
clearwater fla facility pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery 
and could receive up to 20 years imprisonment and fines totaling 
30000 
hilton scheduled sentencing for feb 16 
tomlin who has returned most of the money he received in 
bribes received an 18month sentence for his guilty plea

burger king corps new owners plan to introduce a 
chicken sandwich on an oat bran bun and install new computers in an 
effort to boost sluggish sales at the nations secondlargest fast 
food restaurant chain 
the proposed changes were outlined following release of a 
financial report thursday that indicated sales at burger kings 
5900 restaurants haveincreased 3 percent since grand metropolitan 
plc acquired it in january 
the things that need to be done to fix burger king are not 
instant coffee its a twoyear task said burger king chairman 
ian martin 
burger king which reported sales of 54 billion last year has 
average store sales of about 1 million compared with 16 million 
per store at no 1 mcdonalds 
in addition to a chicken sandwich with an oat bran bun burger 
king plans to introduce about a half dozen new menu items by next 
summer 
martin said breakfast is an area of particular scrutiny 
there is absolutely no secret that when you look at what 
burger king has done it has been substandard said martin 
referring to the breakfast offerings 
burger king also plans to install upgraded computers at 
companyowned stores which automatically track sales said martin 
grand met hopes to open 250 to 300 burger king restaurants next 
year and convert its wimpys restaurants in great britain turkey

a paper route and occasional freelance 
photography jobs have hardly helped adolfo collazo cover the loss 
of his eastern airlines paycheck during the 9monthold machinists 
strike a fact that has hit like a winter storm with the holiday 
season approaching 
this christmas very sad the father of three sons said 
they know it i told them one toy each 
collazo a ramp service worker with 14 years at eastern spoke 
about his financial ordeal as he walked the picket line at 
hartsfield atlanta international airport im still trying to 
catch up with my bills he said 
money is tight and tempers sometimes are too for many of the 
machinists union members who struck eastern march 4 
if you hadnt worked in nine months how would you be getting 
along jd filey snapped from within the small rectangle 
bordered by yellow tape that hartsfield allows for picketing on 
the eastern concourse 
some such as filey and collazo occasionally have found 
parttime work to supplement the 100 a week the union pays for 
walking the picket line others have working spouses or a decent 
savings account balance to help them get by some have left to take 
jobs elsewhere some say they are just broke 
but the pickets who have become fixtures this year at airports 
served by eastern say they are determined to continue their 
strike even though the airlines pilots and flight attendants have 
abandoned their sympathy strikes and little hope for a settlement 
exists 
we didnt think wed be out this long said katie cantrell 
who was a hangar maintenance worker with eastern 16 years until the 
strike now i think ill be in this box this time next year 
ms cantrell and filey a 21year ramp service worker said 
theyve had trouble finding work to help them make ends meet 
employment agencies arent much help 
once you put down you work for eastern no one will hire you 
on a permanent basis said ms cantrell who has relied on her 
husbands salary since the strike began 
they say youre going back to work soon here it is nine 
months thats soon said filey 
the strikers anger toward frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp seems to have turned to frustration at the 
federal government and court system which they say favor airline 
management eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors five days after the strike 
the supposed government has done nothing and after i voted 
for bush said collazo 
the unity is still here because of the way the politicians 
have treated us said ms cantrell everyones been bought 
that judge us bankruptcy judge burton lifland everythings 
gone their way thats amazing to me they wont even give us a 
spark of hope 
their base of operations is now a dilapidated white woodframe 
house about two miles from hartsfield its been the machinists 
strike headquarters since a nov 26 rockthrowing fracas that 
resulted in the expulsion of a union tent city from airport 
grounds theres no sign of progress in the strike 
were still out were gonna stay out said mechanic wayne 
macie who was hanging out at the small house decorated with 
antilorenzo signs a large us flag and a 5foottall santa claus 
poster the good part is the guys are hanging together 
macie said it was difficult to explain what has sustained the 
strikers through the lengthy walkout 
people who dont know whats going on have never worked for 
frank lorenzo and his supervisors macie said 
eastern claims its survived the machinists strike partly by 
hiring 2800 mechanics including 300 union members who have 
crossed the picket lines about 8500 machinists including 4500 
mechanics went on strike 
james ashlock an eastern spokesman in atlanta the airlines 
main hub said the company is continuing to hire mechanics and ramp 
service workers but that the machinists would get no preferential 
treatment if they came back 
theyd essentially be treated as new hires ashlock said 
quite frankly a lot of them are not even around the majority 
have gone on to other jobs including other airlines 
but rj lavender a striking ramp service worker at hartsfield 
said i figure maybe 80 to 85 percent are still walking the 
picket line 
at the airport filey was asked if his enthusiasm for the strike 
might dip with the plunging temperatures of december 
the weather dont have nothing to do with this he said 
well be out here until the bitter end

cold weather helped buoy heating oil futures 
prices friday on the new york mercantile exchange while crude oil 
and gasoline futures finished lower 
domestic heating oil for january delivery rose 090 cent to 
finish at 6637 cents a gallon after a gain of 101 cents on 
thursday contracts for delivery through june closed on the plus 
side while those scheduled for later delivery posted slight 
declines 
analysts attributed the gains in heating oil to strong demand 
stemming from unusually cold weather in parts of the united states 
and europe 
among other refined products traded on the new york merc 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for january delivery which declined 
036 cent on thursday sank another 016 cent to 5265 cents a 
gallon other contracts closed mixed 
the january contract for west texas intermediate the main grade 
of us crude oil lost 3 cents to settle at 2048 per 42gallon 
barrel in fairly slow trading the contract which had gained 4 
cents in the previous session traded as low as 2025 a barrel 
we had good demand to start with and the cold weather just 
adds to that said michael hiley energy broker for drexel 
burnham lambert inc of the activity in heating oil 
bob baker analyst with prudentialbache securities inc said 
barge problems on the rhine river continued to boost gasoil prices 
on european futures markets which had a bullish effect on energy 
markets here gasoil is europes equivalent of us heating oil 
low water levels on the rhine have created logistical problems 
for vessels transporting gasoil to customers and in some cases have 
resulted in delays baker said the delays have come during a time 
of the year when demand for heating oil is high he said

traders have been hoping the soviets would line up with vastly 
larger orders for american grain because of the eastwest thaw but 
so far the only people standing in line are the bread buyers in 
moscow 
grain prices rallied on the chicago board of trade late last 
month on speculation that the malta shipboard meeting between 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev would yield 
trade agreements boosting commodity exports to the soviet union 
however no new trade agreement came out of the summit and no 
announcements resulted from the first round of talks in moscow on a 
new longterm grain agreement between the united states and the 
soviet union 
there is some disappointment the talks in moscow didnt result 
in some kind of announcement said analyst susan leighty of 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york it was expected 
that the us would raise the limit on the amount of grain that can 
be purchased by the soviet union from 16 million metric tons to 20 
million 
after the close of trading friday the us agriculture 
department announced the ussr will be permitted to buy 20 million 
metric tons of grain without seeking prior approval in october 
the usda increased the purchase level from 12 million metric tons 
to 16 million 
so far this year the soviets have purchased 10978 million 
metric tons of corn said william biedermann research director of 
allendale inc a chicago brokerage firm he said its possible the 
soviets will purchase 14 million metric tons of corn a month from 
march through august 
biedermann said what has been disappointing is the small wheat 
purchases by the soviets this year 
biedermann noted that during the grain talks there was 
increased buying by speculators of grain futures 
we sold in that he said we felt the retail purchasing 
was based on emotion 
ms leighty said it is hard to resist the good feeling resulting 
from the changes in eastern europe and the soviet union and what 
it means to the grain trade 
it is assuming too much to link the grain talks to the 
political changes going on in eastern europe and the soviet 
union she said the us and the ussr have longstanding links 
in the grain trade the events dont alter that 
what the soviets want is more liberal credit terms ms leighty 
said but to get that they most liberalize their immigration laws 
to the satisfaction of the united states but they failed to do 
that this year 
however she predicted some kind of accommodation between the 
united states and the soviet union on credit and grain trade 
but it may not happen until next summer ms leighty said

the top japanese computer makers are overtaking 
their us competitors and that forward march is likely to continue 
into the next decade according to a report by the arthur d little 
consulting firm 
the shift will become apparent in the rankings of the top 
computer companies the reports author consultant martyn roetter 
said friday 
furthermore roetter warned that if overseas suppliers become 
the major provider of computers and information services to 
american businesses at large it could harm us competitiveness 
us businesses using foreign computer systems will be at a 
less privileged customer relationship he said 
roetters report uses his estimated revenue to rank the worlds 
20 leading companies in the 270 billion information systems and 
services industry he looked backward to 1988 and projected ahead 
to 1993 
continuing a survey he makes annually roetter added two 
japanese firms toshiba and matsushita to the top 20 joining 
fujitsu nec and hitachi fujitsu also displaced usbased unisys 
from the third place on the list 
the top ranked firms for 1988 were in this order unless 
otherwise indicated the firms are usbased international 
business machines digital equipment fujitsu japan unisys nec 
japan hitachi japan hewlettpackard siemens w germany 
ncr groupe bull france olivetti italy apple toshiba 
japan control data wang nixdorf w germany matsushita 
stcicl england philips netherlands compaq 
looking ahead to 1993 roetter forecast this ranking ibm 
digital fujitsu groupe bullnec strengthening a current 
relationship unisys hitachi hewlettpackard siemens ncr 
olivetti toshiba apple wang nixdorf matsushita stcicl 
compaq philips eds amdahl 
the study also forecast an overall growth rate among the top 20 
of 8 percent to 10 percent through 1993 while respectable this is 
far down from the early 1980s when growth rates ranged up to 25 
percent 
roetter attributed his projections to several factors 
impending saturation of the markets for mainframes and 
minicomputers 
hesitation by consumers facing too many choices 
lack of technology as yet that will integrate computer systems 
so well that users can communicate with each other as easily as it 
is to make an international telephone call 
smaller competitors capturing the fledgling business of 
softwareintensive services 
roetter also warned that while many us companies have 
succeeded in making their presence felt overseas some are badly 
positioned in the international marketplace pushing product lines 
that are fast becoming obsolete 
he predicted that stepped up competition will foster more 
mergers acquisitions and close partnerships with us japanese 
and european firms seeking out partners that will provide strategic 
geographic access to markets 
it was last year that the maturation of the 
informationprocessing industry became more apparent roetter said 
in his report 
most of the firms in the top 20 were troubled by diminished 
profits and some lost money 
many found it necessary to reduce personnel and trim product 
lines and the specter of increased merger activity hung over the 
entire industry roetter said in his report 
against this gloomy backdrop however japanese companies 
fueled by longterm strategic planning and strength in 
communications and semiconductor markets gained ground on their 
european and american counterparts his report said

on other commodity markets cotton continued to lose ground 
grain and soybeans were mixed precious metals gained and energy 
futures were mostly higher 
live cattle settled 07 cent to 47 cent lower with the contract

03 cent to 18 cent lower with january at 8277 cents a pound

a pound and frozen pork bellies were 185 cents to 2 cents lower 
with february at 5245 cents a pound 
the belly contracts for february march and may were down the 
2cent limit friday as traders liquidated their long positions 
said analyst paul hare of linnco futures inc in chicago 
less than expected government purchases of bellies for shipment 
to poland and sentiment the gains in the pork market during the 
past two months was overdone also contributed to the selloff hare 
said adding that the brisk pace of bellies into storage pressured 
prices 
hare said the selloff in pork bellies began two weeks ago after 
rumors the soviet union may be interested in buying us pork 
products failed to materialize 
cotton futures declined sharply on new yorks cotton exchange as 
traders reacted to rumors a major cotton merchant was liquidating 
long positions 
adding to the pressure to sell were expectations the us

corn prices were lower despite reports spain may be in the 
market for one million metric tons of corn said analyst joel 
karlin of research department inc in chicago 
reports that the soviet union also may enter the market for corn 
did little to help corn prices 
a strong soyoil market helped lift soybean futures higher 
prices were helped by reports the united states may assist several 
north african nations in buying soyoil karlin said 
wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 410 a 
bushel corn was cent lower to unchanged with december at 236 
a bushel oats were cent lower to unchanged with december at 
144 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with

newspaper publishers likely will match this 
years modest earnings gains in 1990 as slow advertising revenue 
growth mutes the benefit of cheaper newsprint 
analyst projections of earnings growth ranging from 8 percent to 
10 percent would mean next years profits will be slightly below 
average for the newspaper business earnings gains of 10 percent to 
12 percent are the average 
a soft advertising performance and the inability to raise ad 
rates much greater than the inflation rate has put some pressure on 
profits said john morton media analyst for lynch jones amp ryan 
in washington 
what will help is that newsprint price hikes are not likely 
he said 
morton and other analysts say that while their estimates of 
overall earnings performance call for little change from the gains 
posted in 1989 the pattern will be different 
they expect weak results in the first half of the year and 
stronger gains in the second half barring an unexpectedly sharp 
decline in the level of overall economic activity 
in 1989 the newspaper business got worse as the year went along 
1990 will almost be the mirror image of this year said 
dennis mcalpine who follows the newspaper business for oppenheimer 
amp co 
revenue growth from advertising continues to be sluggish with 
analysts looking for 4 percent to 6 percent growth next year 
the analysts see signs that ad spending by retailers may be 
about to pick up but they say the outlook has worsened for 
classified ad spending 
retail advertising accounts for more than half of newspaper ad 
revenue but gains have been limited in the past two years as 
stores have restrained their spending because of consolidation in 
the retail industry and the problems some new owners have faced in 
meeting hefty debt payments 
we are looking for some of those problems to be resolved next 
year said michael kupinski analyst for ag edwards amp sons inc 
in st louis 
on the other hand classified advertising revenues which 
account for about 30 percent of newspaper ad revenues have begun 
to deteriorate falling in the past two months from the previous 
years levels 
kupinski expects classified ad revenue will decline 3 percent 
next year mostly because of a falloff in helpwanted advertising 
that reflects a weakening economy he said 
national ad revenue which makes up the balance of newspaper ad 
revenue is expected to be up about 7 percent again this year 
kupinski said 
mcalpine said the newspaper industrys increased marketing 
efforts may lead to a 1 percent increase in circulation revenue for 
newspapers next year compared with no growth or slight declines 
last year 
on the cost side the price of newsprint has been falling 
helping the bottom line 
newsprint costs typically comprise 25 percent to 30 percent of 
newspaper costs and newsprint prices fell 7 percent to 8 percent on 
average this year with similar declines expected next year 
mcalpine said 
morton said newsprint prices are falling because of overcapacity 
in the newsprint business he said newsprint suppliers decided 
several years ago when prices were rising steadily to build or 
expand production facilities and those plants are now producing 
more newsprint than the market can absorb 
increases in labor costs are not expected to change much in the 
coming year although some newspaper companies face potentially 
difficult negotiations with their unions on new contracts 
at the moment the analysts said companies with operations in 
the northeast and southwest seem to be headed for the toughest 
times because of regional economic weakness 
they said the west and parts of the midwest should continue to 
benefit from relative economic strength

eastman kodak co president kay r 
whitmore will succeed colby h chandler as chief executive officer 
the company said friday 
whitmore 57 will assume his new position when chandler retires 
june 1 after 40 years with the company chandler has been chief 
executive since 1983 
whitmore who has been with kodak since 1957 has been president 
of the company for six years and an executive officer since 1986 
kodak vice chairman j phillip samper 55 who had been 
considered a rival of whitmore for the top job said he would take 
early retirement effective jan 1 he had become vice chairman and 
an executive officer in 1986 
chandler whitmore and samper have ruled kodak through a 
threeman executive council that officials said will now be 
disbanded giving whitmore sole control of the company kodak 
spokesman henry kaska said the company had no plans to name a 
president or vice chairman for at least a year 
financial analysts said whitmores succession did not represent 
a change in policy for the company which is in the midst of a 
restructuring and jobcutting plan aimed at turning around sagging 
profits 
whitmore has been part of the recent direction anyway said 
eugene glazer of dean witter reynolds i dont see that the 
course of the company is likely to change 
a change in the top by itself does not change the fundamental 
challenges that kodak confronts said mark obenzinger of trinity 
trading co 
whitmore said he planned to continue the restructuring plan 
begun this year 
were following a path and i dont think well fundamentally 
change he said i dont expect the challenges will go away we 
will do what is necessary to be competitive into the future 
chandler said whitmore has solid management experience and 
is fully capable of leading this company forward towards the next 
century 
obenzinger said consolidating kodaks executive control in one 
person is likely to speed up communication and decisionmaking 
a onestop decisionmaker is clearly an advantage for kodak 
he said 
analysts expressed surprise at the departure from the company of

oil giant chevron corp said friday it had 
moved to thwart buyout threats raised by pennzoil cos purchase of 
an 88 percent stake suing to force the sale of the stock and 
beefing up its takeover defenses 
chevron in a us district court suit filed late thursday 
scoffed at pennzoils claim that it was not interested in a 
takeover and accused the much smaller company of plotting to force 
a restructuring that would benefit pennzoil 
pennzoil is seeking to put itself in the position to purchase 
additional chevron shares cheaply in the future and to gain an 
advantage in any contest for chevron assets andor in negotiations 
with chevrons management to force an extraordinary 
restructuring the lawsuit read 
chevron stock rose 12 cents to 6612 a share friday on the 
new york stock exchange pennzoil jumped 325 a share to 8650 
pennzoil based in houston disclosed in a securities and 
exchange commission filing thursday that it paid 21 billion to 
buy 315 million chevron shares over the past three months and 
might buy up to another 500 million worth 
the houstonbased company financed the buying spree with a cash 
hoard won in last years settlement of a historic court battle with 
texaco inc pennzoil said in its sec filing and in a statement 
issued friday that its purchases were a longterm investment and 
that it had no interest in taking over chevron 
but chevron the nations fourthlargest oil company in its 
lawsuit accused pennzoil of concealing its true motives and of 
violating federal securities and antitrust laws 
pennzoil has failed to reveal its true intent which is to 
influence chevron management decisions andor force an 
extraordinary restructuring of chevron which would provide 
chevrons assets to pennzoil the suit said 
the suit accused pennzoil of violating both disclosure laws 
applying to potential takeover bidders and a 30day waiting period 
required before making a stock purchase of more than 15 million 
chevron seeks court orders requiring pennzoil to sell the stock 
and prohibiting further purchases without notice 
chevron also wants a declaration that its board acted legally in 
expanding the companys shareholder rights takeover defense the 
company lowered the threshold at which the plan takes effect so it 
would be triggered once an outsider acquired 10 percent or more of 
chevrons outstanding stock instead of 20 percent as before 
chevron also established a new 5 billion bank credit 
arrangement and said all banks involved had agreed not to knowingly 
finance purchases of chevron stock by third parties 
chief us district judge william ingram issued a temporary 
restraining order thursday evening prohibiting pennzoil from suing 
in any other court over the same issues without notifying the san 
francisco court 
pennzoil issued a statement friday saying its chairman j hugh 
liedtke reiterated that pennzoil has acquired its stock position 
in chevron as a longterm investment and that pennzoil has no 
interest in attempting to take over chevron 
chevron said in the suit that pennzoil has stated repeatedly it 
needs to acquire an oil company in order to get favorable tax 
treatment of 3 billion it received from texaco last year the 
money was an outofcourt settlement of a suit pennzoil won over 
texacos 1984 acquisition of getty oil co 
chevron also said the current pennzoil purchases followed the 
same pattern as pennzoils 1988 acquisition of shares in burlington 
resources inc for 380 million pennzoil said those purchases were 
only an investment but sold the stock after burlington filed a 
suit similar to chevrons present suit chevron alleged 
our board believes that pennzoils acquisition of chevron 
shares is disruptive and represents a threat to the realization of 
our longterm business objectives kenneth t derr chevron 
chairman and chief executive said in a news release 
pennzoils disclosure capped months of takeover speculation 
surrounding chevron which attained its present massive size by 
buying gulf corp for 133 billion in 1984 
on wednesday chevron announced a 1 billion sale of 141 
million shares of its common stock to an employee stock ownership 
plan that could make any takeover more difficult the stock about 
5 percent of the companys outstanding shares was added to 11 
percent already held by an employee profitsharing plan

dominos pizza inc owner tom monaghan 
said friday he may sell the biggest slice of his pizza delivery 
business to employees 
dominos has retained goldman sachs amp co and jp morgan amp co 
to study the feasibility of an employee stock ownership plan 
monaghan said in a news release 
he said he will decide whether to implement an esop on 
completion of the study and will remain as chairman of dominos if 
one is adopted 
monaghan 52 said in september he was considering selling 
dominos to spend more time on charitable activities he founded 
the company in 1960 and owns 97 percent of it 
he has considered alternatives that include creation of an esop 
sale to a corporate buyer or taking the privately held firm public 
by selling stock spokeswoman judy boulter said 
under an esop dominos would borrow money lend it to employees 
as a group to buy a majority share in the company and distribute 
stock to employees as a benefit redeemable as the loan is paid off 
doug dawson treasurer and vice president of finance and 
administration has had discussions with employees about the 
possibility of an esop i think theyre very excited about it 
he said 
he said it hadnt been determined how many of dominos 
approximately 5000 fulltime employees would be eligible to 
participate the investment bankers would look into that he said 
monaghan has said he wants to spend more time on work with the 
roman catholic church and other philanthropic activities including 
legatus a group he founded for catholic chief executive officers 
some industry observers speculate monaghan is considering an 
esop because of trouble finding outside buyers who are interested 
in the company 
the problem is its not a very profitable company milford 
prewett of nations restaurant news a trade publication in new 
york said this week 
dominos the nations second largest pizza chain behind pizza 
hut reported it earned 61 million last year on sales of 23 
billion

they came they saw they constructed roller 
coasters and water slides 
nearly seven years after disney co opened its magic kingdom in 
japan a host of us companies are traveling the globe helping to 
bring theme parks and amusement facilities to a burgeoning middle 
class looking for a good time 
whats happening abroad is what happened in the united states 
in the 70s with tremendous theme park construction said chris 
miles design director at hhcp leisure in maitland fla just 
north of disney world and other orlandoarea parks 
with asian countries becoming more affluent and eastern europe 
opening up there are significant opportunities 
dozens of projects are under way in europe and asia including 
euro disneyland in france and japans 200 million space world 
complex meanwhile us design firms continue to explore other 
proposed ventures ranging from a water park in madrid to 
futuristic thrill rides in south korea 
in japan alone spending on amusement parks rose 94 percent to 
22 billion last year according to the tokyobased leisure time 
development center 
theme park industry executives trace the beginnings of the 
overseas boom to the early 1980s when economies in the far east 
and europe began to improve 
its a reflection of the economic changes in the world 
without a middle class we dont have a business said hugh 
darley president of orlandobased itec productions inc and a 
former disney art director its not the country club crowd that 
goes to theme parks and the lower classes dont have the money to 
spend like in america the middle class is our bread and butter 
darley said overseas projects comprise 60 percent of clients at 
itec which is working on an amusementretail site in switzerland 
and a marinemammal attraction in japan 
miles who helped develop disneys epcot center in florida said 
his company is involved in developing a sea park in jedda saudi 
arabia a carnivaltype setting outside istanbul turkey and a 
fantasy park in france based on the smurf cartoon characters all 
are to open in the early 1990s 
in my opinion the leading edge of leisure technology is going 
on overseas said guy sutton executive vice president of 
international theme park services inc a cincinnatibased design 
and consulting firm that has worked on parks in singapore britain 
and france 
most industry experts predict a trend toward robotics and 
attractions using sophisticated computers and highdefinition 
television technology 
at the moment miles said the europeans seem to enjoy more 
fantasy and historyoriented themes while asians are dazzled by 
scientific wonders 
no matter what is to come well still have to cater to the 
individual tastes of the countries said sutton who estimated 
even a modest theme park costs 75 million you have to make it 
comfortable for the local people 
generally cuisine has the most hometown flavor in asia 
vendors offer simple fare such as sausage and bread the french 
prefer croissants to cotton candy and spaniards search out their 
regular afternoon snacks called tapas 
in lines asians tend to be more patient and comfortable in 
confined places while some europeans grumble and fidget japanese 
ride operators are vigilant to tuck in loosefitting kimonos 
there are a lot of cultural differences said darley but 
when you go deeper you find the 12yearold in everyone no matter 
if theyre swiss or japanese fun is fun its a lot like us film 
overseas if they are good people enjoy them 
the international association of amusement parks and attractions 
estimates there are more than 320 parks outside north america 
ranging from dusty midways to the gleaming tokyo disney land which 
drew 13 million visitors last year 
in the united states an estimated 254 million people visited 
the nearly 600 theme and amusement parks said peter irish a 
spokesman at the alexandria vabased trade group 
in japan where at least eight major amusement parks are under 
construction the flagship is the giant space world on the southern 
island of kyushu built by shinnippon steel the nations largest 
steel company the park equidistant from tokyo and seoul south 
korea will feature a simulated nasa astronaut training camp for 
children and a 60by90 foot theater 
euro disneyland is scheduled to open in 1992 and other proposals 
include a theme park near lisbon portugal based on the pioneering 
expeditions of early seafaring explorers 
irish noted that latin american countries such as mexico and 
brazil have also increased construction of small amusement parks 
but foreign investors remain skittish 
thats probably the next growth area said michael hayes 
marketing director of cincinnatibased kzf inc which is designing 
a theme park on the french riviera and a childrens playland at the 
madrid zoo if theres a time when the economic climate is right 
down there well all be looking south

linda hightower has carried 13 years of 
guilt and another five years of anger as a victim of the dalkon 
shield birth control device 
now that 25 billion is about to go into a trust fund to pay 
thousands of women who were injured by the intrauterine device she 
is relieved 
i felt comfortable once we got the supreme courts approval of 
the plan said ms hightower director of the atlantabased 
dalkon shield victims association 
what were gearing for now is trying to make sure women are 
prepared for the process of reviewing their medical records she 
said this is the real nitty gritty 
the compensation is part of the reorganization of the ah 
robins co a pharmaceutical manufacturer that distributed and sold 
thousands of the iuds in the early 1970s 
as of this friday robins will become a part of the american 
home products corp of new york closing the richmondbased 
companys chapter 11 bankruptcy case that began in august 1985 when 
robins sought protection from creditors in the aftermath of 
thousands of lawsuits claiming injury from the iud 
the acquisition of robins also involves a 700 million exchange 
of stock 
for ms hightower the dalkon shield story began in the summer 
of 1971 when she began using the device nevertheless she 
subsequently became pregnant carried the baby to full term but 
began to bleed severely during labor her daughter was born 
braindamaged 
at the time ms hightower did not know the name of the iud she 
was using she said her doctor told her that problems during 
pregnancy resulted from her bodys reaction to the iud and that the 
product itself was not at fault 
not until 1984 when she read about another womans dalkon 
shield lawsuit did she learn the name of the iud and that others 
had similar problems 
until then every time i looked at my daughter i felt guilty 
for what i had done to her she said 
soon however her guilt turned to anger at robins she is 
convinced that the company knew of potential defects in the iud 
when the product was put on the market 
to deliberately do something like that she said her 
voice trailing off 
last month the supreme court refused to take up an appeal of 
the robins case rejecting a challenge brought by a group of 
dalkon shield claimants who wanted to seek additional compensation 
from the companys officers and others 
the decision left intact the reorganization package approved 
june 15 by the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
john r stafford chairman president and chief executive 
officer of american home products announced last week that the 
company would complete the acquisition of robins the cornerstone 
of the reorganization on dec 15 
on that day the dalkon shield trust will get the 25 billion 
said michael sheppard director of the trusts claims resolution 
facility 
the trust which is independent of both robins and american home 
products has been working on a packet of information that will be 
sent to approximately 112000 remaining claimants about march 1 
sheppard said 
the claimants will have four options he said a 725 payment 
for women who do not have major injuries and for which no medical 
records are required a scheduled payment based on the type of 
injury and requiring some medical documentation a full review of 
medical records for severe injuries and a delay in the evaluation 
of claims for up to three years for women who used the device but 
have experienced no injury or only a slight injury and think the 
problem may get worse 
the trust which received 100 million in startup money last 
year pending the cases appeal already has settled the claims of 
about 80000 women 
ms hightower whose organizations mailing list includes about 
1000 claimants said every day that the trust has waited for the 
full settlement has cost thousands of dollars in interest and 
raised the possibility that vital medical records needed by 
claimants could get misplaced or destroyed 
lots of women believe that the trust is going to take care of 
them she said the trust is trying to make things simple and 
theyre very nice people who are trying to help us but women 
need to get their medical records and they should take the records 
to an attorney to see what problems they foresee its worth 50 to 
have somebody look at your forms 
roscoe e puckett jr a robins spokesman said the company will 
continue to operate under that name as a subsidiary of american 
home products after friday no decision has been announced on the 
role of robins executives he said

or 437 for every 1000 in face value its yield which falls 
when its price rises tumbled to 788 percent from 792 percent 
late thursday 
the labor department reported that novembers unemployment rate 
crept up to 54 percent from 53 percent in october

revision in payroll growth in october which cheered bond traders

93000 from 233000 
traders have been hoping for evidence of sluggish economic 
activity 
the data were viewed as constructive for the bond market 
said william sullivan director of moneymarket research at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
each new indication of economic weakness improves the chances 
that the federal reserve will try to stimulate growth by pushing 
interest rates lower analysts say lower rates tend to boost bond 
prices 
analysts doubt the central bank will make any dramatic moves 
soon however because some sectors of the economy still are strong 
by late morning sullivan said it appeared the initial euphoria 
over the jobless report was beginning to fade as traders realized 
that a shift in fed policy probably was not imminent 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose 316 point to point intermediate 
maturities gained 516 point to 1332 point and longterm issues 
advanced 1332 point to 716 point according to figures provided

measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 299 to 119508

dec 31 the first time regulators will know exactly what they 
own the process of selling the property however could take time

those properties he said however carmen sullivan who heads the 
rtcs dallas region said an aug 31 estimate valued the land held 
at about 3 billion in 8000 parcels 1400 parcels of commercial

the bush administration is actively reviewing 
proposals to relax the ban on sale of high technology exports to 
warsaw pact countries some of whom may help keep them out of the 
hands of their communist neighbors commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher said friday 
mosbacher said the review of current controls on hightechnology 
products which should result in proposals for change by april is 
a reflection of the sweeping changes occuring in the communist bloc 
everybody is discussing what we should be doing about eastern 
europe whether it is politically economically or 
technologically he said 
mosbacher indicated that hungary and poland could be two of the 
main beneficiaries of such a change he said those two countries 
were discussing with us officials how to prevent the transfer of 
militarily strategic items to neighboring communist bloc countries 
hungary and poland have talked about giving us additional 
assurances about what they are doing with higher technology 
mosbacher said 
a change in us restrictions still under discussion in several 
government agencies would be designed to encourage the political 
liberalization in eastern europe and to deal with heavy pressure 
from us allies seeking an easing of export controls to the soviet 
bloc 
us insistence until now on preserving the controls imposed 
for nearly 40 years by the 17nation coordinating committee on 
multilateral exports cocom has been a sticking point in 
relations between the bush administration and its allies 
we will relook at the cocom levels and probably change the 
level of some things approved for transshipment to the eastern 
bloc mosbacher said earlier in an interview taped for public 
televisions american interests program 
the united states is considering a shortening of the list of 
restricted items to those things which are truly important and 
essential he said the shortening will be substantial that 
would be our recommendation said mosbacher 
mosbacher said a final administration decision would be made in 
time to present proposals at the next meeting of cocom scheduled 
for april in paris cocom consists of the 15 nato nations japan 
and australia 
the administration has been split during the debate over the 
liberalization between hardliners such as defense secretary dick 
cheney who opposes the easing for national security reasons and 
others such as mosbacher who deals not only with us allies but 
also american businesses 
mosbacher said countries such as poland and hungary have 
promised to allow monitoring to make sure western technology 
exports are not being diverted to other countries 
those countries who have talked to us about onsite 
inspections theyre not doing transshipment from their country to 
another country i think were going to get a lot better 
treatment he said 
hungary has spoken to us about it with poland were in the 
early stages of discussions about it and there may be others down 
the line mosbacher said 
mosbacher said the liberalization would not apply to the soviet 
union 
we have a lot of steps with the soviets before we get to that 
point he said 
the united states also will eliminate the casebycase approval 
required until now to export dualuse high technology items to 
other cocom members said deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
dual use refers to technology that can be used for a stated 
civilian purpose or refashioned to produce weapons the united 
states has repeatedly clashed with its allies especially west 
germany italy and japan over what it argues are violations of 
cocom rules regarding dualuse technology 
in the latest such case the administration has accused the 
italian computer manufacturer olivetti of selling the soviet union 
computerized machine tools that the soviets used to make jet 
fighter engines 
eagleburger said the requirement for individual licenses will be 
lifted within six months he spoke last week in a washington speech 
referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports to 
eastern europe eagleburger said the nature of the military 
threat faced by the west is changing 
we and our cocom partners will want to signal our clear 
willingness to respond constructively to the democratization under 
way in eastern europe he added
