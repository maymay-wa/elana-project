jim bakker the television evangelist who 
lost his ptl empire in a sex scandal was sentenced to 45 years in 
prison and fined 500000 tuesday for defrauding his followers for 
his own enrichment 
im deeply sorry for those i have hurt bakker 49 said 
before he was sentenced by us district judge robert potter i 
have sinned but never in my life did i intend to defraud 
bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor 
presented arguments as did his daughter tammy sue chapman 
bakkers wife tammy faye did not attend the court session 
potter is nicknamed maximum bob after his reputation for 
harsh sentences particularly in drug sentences 
bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years but the judge 
consolidated the 24 fraud and conspiracy counts to nine and 
sentenced bakker to five years on each bakker could be eligible 
for parole in 10 years 
his lawyers said they would appeal and despite defense pleas 
bakker was immediately taken into custody and driven to the 
mediumsecurity federal correctional institution at talladega 
ala about 60 miles east of birmingham 
in handing down the sentence potter said im concerned about 
the hundreds of letters i have here from people who say theyd do 
anything for him and that could include preventing mr bakker from 
going to prison i believe them 
because of that he said i think were going to have to put 
him into custody 
at that point bakkers daughter broke into sobs 
bakker was put in a holding cell then taken away in a 
government sedan to talladega he arrived at the prison about 930 
pm cdt and was led in handcuffs and shackles to the prison 
entrance 
bakker kept his eyes on the ground and did not comment as he was 
hustled inside surrounded by six guards a prison official said 
bakker would probably be transferred to another prison in one or 
two weeks 
bakkers attorney harold bender said his client was in as 
good spirits as he can be under the circumstances of course hes 
concerned about the lengthy sentence but he has strong faith and 
will come through 
bender said he had filed notice of appeal with the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals in richmond va and would ask the court 
to free bakker on bond 
assistant us attorney jerry miller said bakkers sentence 
sends a message that you cant use tv and the mails to make 
fraudulent statements to get people to send money to you this is a 
simple fraud case 
jessica hahn the former church secretary whose sexual tryst 
with bakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose 
control of ptl in 1987 said she wasnt satisfied with the sentence 
it cannot repay those millions of dollars and the years of 
work people did to make it but at least its a start hahn said 
in a telephone interview with the associated press from her west 
hollwood calif home at least people can feel like they wont 
be taken for fools 
how must they feel she asked the ones who gave millions 
the people who took out loans 
bakker supporter helen gordon said the sentence was not fair 
jim bakkers no crook the news media made him look like one 
she said 
there was no sign of mrs bakker in charlotte or at the couples 
home in orlando fla where the couple established a new church 
and television ministry 
former defense attorney george t davis said the sentence was 
pretty heavy for a whitecollar criminal thats pretty 
startling davis who was interviewed by telephone in atlanta 
while awaiting a flight to his home in hawaii said he asked bakker 
to release him from the case before sentencing 
prosecutors didnt recommend a specific sentence but asked 
potter for a long sentence and a heavy fine arguing that bakker 
hasnt assumed responsibility for his crimes the government also 
asked that bakker be ordered to repay up to 100 million in money 
donated by followers 
potter did not order bakker to make restitution saying that 
issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy court 
bender asked potter to consider alternatives to prison and 
allow this defendant the benefit of the courts compassion and 
mercy 
bakker was convicted oct 5 on 23 counts of fraud and one count 
of conspiracy for selling lodging guarantees at his christian 
retreat when he knew there werent enough rooms available 
the jury which began hearing the case aug 28 found that 
bakker used more than 37 million of his followers money to buy 
luxurious homes fancy cars jewelry and expensive vacations 
those who bought the lodging guarantees called lifetime 
partners sent him more than 158 million the partners then were 
supposed to be entitled to three nights lodging each year at the 
ptl ministrys heritage usa retreat at fort mill sc 
bakker resigned from the ptl on march 19 1987 amid a sex and 
money scandal involving ms hahn 
during the trial which lasted nearly six weeks defense 
attorneys called 75 witnesses including more than 50 who were 
loyal bakker supporters 
prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses including many 
lifetime partners who had sent money usually 1000

beneath a cracked steeple people prayed 
and embraced by a flattened freeway children played in the 
setting sun as bells tolled a man stared at the shards of his old 
piano 
it was 504 pm and northern california took a minute for 
reflection on a minute of fear 
exactly one week after the oct 17 earthquake the sound of 
church bells filled san francisco and james eimers returned to the 
ruins of his marina district apartment building the focus of the 
goodyear blimps network camera as the structure blazed that night 
i came back just to see i wanted to get in and see what i 
could see to put some kind of closure on the whole experience 
eimers said 
his 1914 steinway piano was barely discernible in the debris 
burned were 15 years of genealogical research on his family 
missing were his cats patrick nicholas and lucy 
im still pretty numb he said 
the bells tolling surprised nicole hinton who was talking with 
a friend on steps next door to the citys 200yearold mission 
dolores church at 504 they happened to be discussing the quake 
im refeeling the fear and terror of not knowing if my brother 
and sisterinlaw are safe she said the feeling the worlds 
not safe to walk on 
down the coast in santa cruz holy cross church is closed a red 
tag marking a portal and the steeple cracked by the quake 
were not going to be saddened were going to rebuild not 
out of fear but out of hope pastor james p henry said at an 
outdoor service at 504 
some of the 150 people present embraced listening to readings 
from the book of genesis 
all was quiet in candlestick park where light stands had shook 
and concrete had fallen in chunks a week before at 504 tuesday 
construction workers were patching cracks getting ready for 
fridays restart of the world series they didnt seem to notice 
the time of day 
it was sunset and light winds wisped through the bluecollar 
neighborhood on the west side of sagging interstate 880 in oakland 
children played and giggled regardless of the roads looming 
wreckage stopping his bike an 8yearold boy who gave his name 
only as nate told how hed watched as two men jumped and a truck 
fell from the buckling roadway a week earlier 
at the charles p howard terminal of the port of oakland where 
buck helm worked before i880 fell on him the yellow panel truck 
that was his home during the week remained parked where it always 
was the rundown alarm clocks inside werent ticking at 504

clerk like helm who spent the moment thinking of him and of how 
theyd left work around the same time that night 
a train was crossing a set of tracks and he had to stop 
thats when i passed him going up to the freeway said parker 
who saw the cloud of dust rise behind him from the collapse that 
would trap helm for four days 
im going home to celebrate its been one week momma has 
some of that apple juice with bubbles in it like champagne yeah 
sparkling cider ill have a glass of sparkling cider 
at 504 on oct 17 elizabeth patrice cupples was 1 minute old

the magnitude of the deadly earthquake 
that pelted northern california last week was increased from 69 to 
a 71 after seismologists studied additional monitoring charts 
geophysicists said 
the quake was recorded at 504 pm pdt on oct 17 and was 
blamed for the deaths of dozens of people injuries to thousands 
and damage in excess of 7 billion 
besides altering the richter scale reading the us geological 
survey altered the epicenter and focal depth 
the revised magnitude was based on more clearly defined data 
that was recorded at 18 selected seismic stations all over the 
world waverly person director of the usgs national earthquake 
information service in golden colo said in a statement tuesday 
the original magnitude of 69 was based on more localized 
seismic readings the statement sid 
the temblor was the largest quake to occur along the san andreas 
fault since the 1906 san francisco quake waverly said that quake 
has been estimated at 83 on the richter scale of ground motion 
although monitoring equipment had not been invented at that time 
thousands of aftershocks have rattled the bay area region in the 
week since the main quake 
the epicenter of the quake was moved one mile northeast but was 
still in the loma prieta area said usgs geophysicist andrew pitt 
geologically the most significant change in readings was the 
focal depth originally measured at 12 kilometers but now believed 
to have been 18 kilometers pitt said 
you measure from the surface down it started at a depth of 18 
kilometers and broke upward horizontally he explained

rather than just write out a check 
volunteers toil every day at the harrison street salvation army 
warehouse unloading emergency supplies from toiletries to toys 
donated from across the country 
for many reasons they drive to this twostory warehouse in the 
citys southofmarket district to give their sweat and time 
helping people they do not know at a time of great need 
i did it for the feeling that i get says thomas kay 20 
who came from san mateo on his day off from a safeway store to help 
rodger christopherson 60 drove from his home in bevelry hills 
300 miles south of san francisco to do his part he worked 12 
hours on sunday including a supply trip to quakeravaged 
watsonville 
still the selfemployed screenwriter and novelist shrugs off 
the long hours i think its much better to have a firsthand 
experience he says 
a dozen volunteers shuttled about the 10000squarefoot 
warehouse on monday sorting boxes and bags filled with sleeping 
bags blankets clothes canned food and drinks 
stacked along one wall of the damp warehouse are boxes with some 
6800 loaves of bread delivered overnight by the owner of a 
portland ore bakery other walls are piled high with 10 to 
12foot stacks of cereal water sodas and paper supplies 
almost lost amid the supplies that litter the concrete floor is 
a single yellow toy truck the toy is missing some parts but it 
symbolizes the thousands of heartfelt gifts pouring in from all 
points 
the publics generosity is not lost on the volunteers such as 
paul potrok a 26yearold sailor who came here with several other 
crew members of the san diegobased uss schenectady 
with all the problems and stuff youd think people would be 
pretty tight but people have been pretty good says potrok as 
he sorts through a bag of clothes 
stories of good deeds are told and retold by volunteers 
one found a handdrawn colored postcard inside a box of donated 
goods written in crayon it said in childs printing i hope you 
get your house back soon angie 
and theres the story about the elderly woman who saved her 
money for a year to buy a nice down jacket only to give it to a 
volunteer following the quake 
she just said that she had openheart surgery recently and it 
had taken her a year to buy it and she felt that other people 
needed it more recalls major gordon helms divisional secretary 
of the salvation army 
helms oversees the volunteer organization at the warehouse 
people have been good he says one gentleman stopped his car in 
front of the building jumped out and dropped off a television 
set helms accepted a gift of 90000 pounds of potatoes from oregon 
a woman in kansas city told him monday she was sending a 
shipment of five boxes of toiletries by airplane 
people are just very generous says helms wearing a red 
sweater over his white salvation army uniform theyre very 
concerned about the needs of other people 
he said 1400 volunteers have pitched in to help at the harrison 
street warehouse over the past four days 
theyve just been fantastic says helms 
christopherson the screenwritervolunteer was asked if he had 
any advice f or anyone thinking of volunteers 
i think just to be aware of other peoples suffering he 
said and do what their conscience tells them

ann smith likes to be where the action is 
when disaster strikes 
bob lytles wife wanted him out of her kitchen 
both retired they are reservists for the federal emergency 
management agency who help the agency stretch when the pressure is 
on 
last month they were helping victims of hurricane hugo now 
theyre pulling 12hours shifts at the veterans memorial building 
in oakland where fema set up its disaster assistance center to 
handle applications for grants and lowinterest loans 
smith 61 retired in june from the california department of 
transportation office in redding but has been a fema reservist for 
three years 
before she retired she saved up vacation time to work disasters 
its an organization thats there quickly and we like to be 
part of the action said smith who is assistant manager of the 
disaster assistance center here 
lytle 78 of tempe ariz a retired associated professor of 
agricultural engineering has been a reservist 12 years 
my wife said she married for better or worse but not for 
lunch said lytle she wanted to know what are you going to 
do to stay out of my kitchen 
until recently neither one had been sent to a disaster in more 
than a year and a half 
on sept 1 lytle was sent to baton rouge la to a flood 
three weeks later he was sent to charleston sc for hurricane 
hugo a day at home and he was in oakland to help open an 
earthquake disaster assistance center 
smith was packed and ready to go to the grand canyon on vacation 
with her husband larry another fema reservist now working in 
monterey county when the call came sept 24 for hugo 
we split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to 
puerto rico she said 
three weeks later they both were sent to help out with the 
quake 
we had a beautiful spring and summer at home she said i 
havent been home at all this fall 
both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest 
challenges 
if you go to a laundromat thats an hour you could be 
sleeping lytle said 
coasttocoast diasters have stretched fema but it hasnt 
snapped yet said spokesman bill mcada in washington 
i sure dont want to see it strained much more though 
mcada said right now i have laying on my desk a request for a 
disaster declaration from the state of kentucky where flood 
damages are estimated at 12 million mcada said were about to 
find out whether we can meet more demands or not 
the agency has 3000 people assigned to hurricane hugo and the 
california earthquake he said of them only 200 are fulltime 
fema employees six hundred are regular reservists who have been 
trained in advance and are called up in time of need the remaining 
2200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being 
thrown in the breach 
hurricane damage has accounted for 350000 disaster aid 
applications from puerto rico 8000 from the virgin islands 
51000 from south carolina and 2800 from north carolina mcada 
said 
a week after the earthquake struck californias bay area 10000 
applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven 
counties said fema spokeswoman rhoda brooks 
more than 400 people of various specialties from the army corps 
of engineers have been dispatched from around the country to verify 
disaster claims before fema signs checks 
the total number of applications from hugo and the earthquake 
alone amount to more than three years worth under normal 
ccircumstances mcada said 
i dont think our people would ever admit they have reached 
their limit somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower 
but i dont know where that is he said 
do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the 
current situation then sit around and do nothing for a year 
thats not very effecive 
instead fema lets people like smith and lytle do the sitting 
around 
i just sit at home and rock slowly til they call me lytle 
said

huge pepper tree is the centerpiece of the twoacre garden of 
marble and granite where most graves bear the inscription rest 
in peace 
we suffered extensive damage to the upright stones in four 
cemeteries said dias valley cemetery was spared damage because 
only flat markers are allowed 
dias said the cemeteries had received dozens of telephone calls 
from concerned relatives graveyard officials assured them repairs 
would be swift 
dias said cemetery workers were trying to clear away debris and 
repair damage on a cold and rainy tuesday one week after the

in 1956 the soviet union sent tanks and 
soldiers into budapest to crush an anticommunist revolt now with 
hungary declaring itself a democracy and moscow coping with its own 
internal turmoil the kremlin is deafeningly quiet 
with poland and east germany also absorbed in their own 
turbulent politics it has been left to hungarys orthodox 
neighbors czechoslovakia and romania to sound the communist alarm 
about the historic events in budapest 
their concern is compounded by worries about the reaction of 
their own large ethnic hungarian minorities who were able to 
follow commemorations of the 1956 hungarian uprising on live 
hungarian television broadcasts monday 
a political coup detat thundered the communist party daily 
pravda in slovakia on monday commenting on a historic 
parliamentary session in budapest that rewrote the hungarian 
constitution to embrace democracy and pave the way for free 
elections next year 
romania so far has been silent about that session and mondays 
rallies in which more than 100000 hungarians cheered the 
proclamation of a democratic republic on the 33rd anniversary of 
their popular uprising 
but president nicolae ceausescu of romania perhaps the 
staunchest communist ideologue in the east bloc last week 
denounced hungarys path he pledged romania would never follow the 
same course toward a free market 
at odds with budapest for years over charges that romania is 
harassing its 17 million ethnic hungarians ceausescu is bound to 
be further unsettled by the strident demands for democracy voiced 
in budapest on monday 
a unique race in central europe with no linguistic bonds to 
neighboring slavs and germans hungarians have a tradition of 
maneuvering for the maximum freedom despite dominance by stronger 
neighbors 
this history has also made them fiercely nationalistic a pride 
that has not died in the extensive former hungarian territories now 
incorporated in czechoslovakia romania and yugoslavia 
ceausescus tough rule has so far kept ethnic hungarian 
yearnings for more freedom from combining with widespread 
discontent at food and fuel shortages to ignite major outbreaks of 
unrest such as that which occurred in the transylvanian city of 
brasov in november 1987 when 10000 angry workers took to the 
streets in protest 
while czechoslovakia and romania bristle the soviet union turns 
the other cheek moscows reticence toward the dramatic changes in 
hungary confirm that president mikhail gorbachev plagued by 
strikes and ethnic unrest at home is sticking to his policy of 
noninterference in eastern europe 
referring to hungarys ruling communist partys decision to 
disband and form a socialist party that espouses democratic ideals 
soviet east european expert oleg bogomolov wrote in the oct 15 
edition of the weekly moscow news obviously difficulties lie 
ahead as it appears the new party will be sailing in stormy and 
hazardous waters 
bogomolov is credited with helping forge the new soviet attitude 
toward its allies in his commentary he insisted on only one 
point that hungarians mustnt question the existence of the 
warsaw pact and their contacts within the soviet trading bloc 
similar assurances from solidarity labor leader lech walesa in 
poland helped lead to the august nomination of noncommunist prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
hungarys reformminded leaders hope to stave off the resounding 
defeat suffered by the polish communists in june elections 
adopting a program of radical economic and political change in an 
effort to win popular support 
however the pace of change in hungary is so swift that opinion 
polls indicate its current leaders will at best be only partners in 
a coalition government after elections 
the soviets and the rest of eastern europe will then have to 
deal with the implications of another ouster of communism through 
the ballot box

baker singled out the deadliest missiles in superpower arsenals 
capable of devastating an enemy in a surprise attack during a 
speech monday in san francisco he also urged the soviets to join 
in a strategy shift to defense 
we want to see soviet defensive military operations made 
habitual baker said in his first indepth description of the

on both sides 
he said the united states would explore a cooperative and 
stable transition to a greater reliance on stabilityenhancing 
costeffective strategic defense 
bakers emphasis on reducing firststrike weapons such as 
soviet ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles signals a subtle 
shift from the reagan administrations stress on acrosstheboard 
strategic cuts 
baker made no reference to the 30 percent to 50 percent cutback 
us negotiators have been aiming for in the strategic arms 
reduction talks some analysts such as former secretary of state 
henry a kissinger have urged greater emphasis on slashing 
firststrike weapons such as the soviet ss18s 
designed to destroy an adversarys ballistic missiles in their 
silos firststrike nuclear weapons have a potential of wreaking 
havoc on the other sides nuclear forces 
former president reagan responded to a perceived soviet threat 
by beginning a defensive program known popularly as star wars 
designed to destroy soviet ballistic missiles in space before they 
could destroy their targets 
baker in his speech encouraged the soviets to concentrate 
their efforts on defense as well while the bush administration 
pursues the strategic defense initiative 
he said the us goal in the geneva talks was a new 
relationship in which the capabilities and incentives to attack 
first are minimized and the possibilities of strategic defense are 
pursued 
he said the bush administration had tailored its proposals in 
geneva to emphasize the relative merits of slowflying weapons 
such as cruise missiles and bombers that are not suitable for a 
first strike 
at the same time baker urged a skeptical congress to approve a 
white house request for 100 million to produce mobile midgetman 
missiles otherwise he said the soviets could exploit differences 
between capitol hill and the bush administration 
the house eliminated the request from the 305 billion defense 
authorization bill but the senate gave its approval for the funds 
a congressional conference committee is trying to reconcile this 
and other differences 
congress needs now to support start not undercut it by 
funding this program baker said 
baker had planned to speak to the private commonwealth club on 
arms control last thursday but the speech was postponed because of 
the san francisco bay area earthquake

the energy department underestimated or 
ignored health and safety problems at the rocky flats nuclear arms 
plant as it gave the operator millions of dollars in bonus fees 
federal auditors said today 
a report by the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress said in the fiscal years 198688 rockwell 
international corp won 268 million in award fees for running the 
plant which has been under fbi investigation for alleged criminal 
violation of environmental laws since june 
we believe that the seriousness of the environmental safety 
and health problems were never conveyed in the evaluations 
of the plants performance the report concluded 
rockwell announced last month that it was withdrawing from the 
plant and the energy department said oct 11 that egampg inc had 
agreed to take over jan 1 
the plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and is 
owned by the government 
the gao report was being released today during a house 
government operations subcommittee hearing on energy department 
problems with the private companies that run major nuclear weapons 
facilities in 12 states under government contracts 
many of the contracts including that at rocky flats reimburse 
the company for all operating costs and allow bonus fees based on 
performance in key areas including production of arms materials 
and compliance with health and safety rules the fees are set 
during semiannual performance evaluations 
rep mike synar dokla chairman of the subcommittee said 
monday that the terms of the rockwell contract made it difficult 
for the energy department to effectively manage the plant about 16 
miles from downtown denver 
synar said the rocky flats problem was typical of management 
weaknesses throughout the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex 
which includes 17 major plants 
the department effectively has left itself no way to control 
the performance of its contractors or to hold them fully 
accountable for their actions synar said 
the gao said the 268 million in bonus fees for rockwell during 
the 198688 period represented 84 percent of the total awards 
possible under its contract 
in this period the energy departments operations office in 
albuquerque nm rated rockwells health and safety performance 
as moderately good to excellent 
the report said that while rockwell rightly was applauded for 
holding down the number of work days lost due to injury fire loss 
and property losses some of its shortcomings in the health and 
safety area were underestimated or ignored 
among the problems downplayed by the energy department 
according to the gao report were an inadequate health physics 
program repeated violations of environmental regulations and the 
questionable quality of the monitoring data used to comply with 
environmental laws 
under the energy department award fee system rockwell was 
encouraged to increase production at building 771 the main 
plutonium processing center despite safety problems there 
about two months before building 771 was shut down due to safety 
problems in october 1988 the energy department awarded rockwell 
310000 for increased plutonium production the report said the 
building resumed production in january 
the gao noted that energy secretary james d watkins has 
substantially changed the terms of management contracts at some 
weapons facilities since he took office in march and that further 
adjustments were planned

housing secretary jack kemp says elected 
administration officials should have more influence over interest 
rate policies set by the federal reserve board 
kemp a longtime critic of the nations independent central 
bank told the annual convention of the mortgage bankers 
association of america that he favors putting the treasury 
secretary on the fed board and forcing it to announce its monetary 
policy decisions immediately 
i believe sunlight on the feds operations is called for i 
also believe the fed could use some input from the democratically 
elected executive branch kemp said monday 
he endorsed legislation sponsored by reps lee hamilton dind 
chairman of the joint economic committee and byron dorgan dnd 
that would require the fed to release the decisions of its 
policymaking federal open market committee immediately rather than 
waiting for six weeks the current practice 
originally hamilton and dorgan wanted to place the treasury 
secretary on the open market committee which meets eight times a 
year to set interest rate and monetary policy 
however hamilton has said he will modify the bill to instead 
require two meetings a year between the open market committee and 
senior administration officials 
the fed an independent body whose members are appointed by the 
president but cant be removed by him during their 14year terms 
has long been the target of critics who allege it favors high 
interest rates to fight inflation at the expense of jobs and 
economic growth 
interest rates are too high either by long or shortterm 
historical perspectives kemp said i believe the best thing 
the fed can do for the economy is to allow it to grow at a healthy 
rate by keeping interest rates down 
kemps comments follow statements in recent months from 
president bush and his budget director richard darman both of 
whom have pushed for lower interest rates 
a housing secretary usually would not comment on monetary 
policy leaving that to either the treasury secretary or the 
presidents chief economic adviser 
kemp however is a former republican member of congress from 
new york and candidate for the gop presidential nomination who has 
a longstanding interest in the subject and has frequently 
criticized the central bank 
the hamiltondorgan bill is one of two measures that will 
receive a hearing wednesday before the house banking subcommittee 
on domestic monetary policy the other sponsored by rep stephen 
neal dnc is a resolution exhorting the fed to set a target of 
reaching noninflationary economic growth within five years 
neals resolution is supported by fed chairman alan greenspan 
who is scheduled to testify at the hearing

a former top housing official says he did 
nothing improper in providing campaign debate advice to george bush 
last year while administering a program now at the center of the 
hud scandal 
former assistant housing secretary thomas t demery provided 
debating points on housing using documents from computer files in 
his office at the department of housing and urban development 
according to demery and documents released by the department monday 
under the freedom of information act 
demerys contact with the bush campaign was republican 
consultant paul manafort who has admitted to congress that he 
practiced influencepeddling at hud 
manafort is a partner in a disputed new jersey housing 
development that received more than 31 million in federal 
subsidies he has acknowledged to congressional investigators that 
he lobbied hud on more than 20 other projects 
demery in an interview said he did not believe bush used the 
debate material 
in other documents demery said he delivered campaign speeches 
for bush sometimes while traveling on hud business 
demery administered the departments section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program which provided lucrative subsidy grants 
sought by developers including manafort and manaforts clients 
alleged abuses of the moderate rehabilitation program including 
the steering of lucrative subsidy grants to politically favored 
developers triggered further investigations of hud programs by 
congressional committees and the justice department says it is 
investigating hud activities across the nation 
in the interview demery acknowledged providing tips for bushs 
debates with democrat michael dukakis he contended there was 
nothing improper about providing political advice while working at 
hud because he was a presidential appointee named by president 
reagan 
in one document he said that dukakis the governor of 
massachusetts has presided over de facto segregation in boston 
public housing and said the city still contains some of the last 
vestiges of segregation in america today 
demery was sharply criticized in a hud audit report issued by 
inspector general paul adams last may the audit charged favoritism 
in the awarding of moderate rehabilitation grants and questioned 
his efforts to raise money from developers and others dealing with 
hud for a favored charity food for africa 
demery contends others made the subsidy decisions and that his 
activities for the charity were proper 
demerys files contained letters he wrote to adams last year 
defending his actions and questioning the investigation 
he wrote one letter to fbi director william sessions complaining 
about the inspector generals investigation but he said monday he 
never mailed it demerys letter charged that his mail had been 
intercepted and the documents involving his personal finances 
eventually were obtained by the inspector general 
other documents show that demery complained to thensecretary 
samuel pierce about the activities of hunter cushing then deputy 
assistant secretary for multifamily housing and reprimanded 
cushing directly for poor work 
demery contends that although cushing reported to him cushing 
was engaged in political work and worked with deborah gore dean 
pierces former top aide dean pierce and cushing have all refused 
to testify before congressional investigators citing their 
constitutional rights against selfincrimination

at least three electric utilities admit making 
deals with nuclear plant workers that could be seen as rewarding 
them for not reporting potential safety problems government 
records show 
all three companies insisted in letters to the nuclear 
regulatory commission that the labor settlements were legal and 
proper but they acknowledged some provisions might be viewed as 
silenceformoney deals 
duke power co of charlotte nc gpu nuclear corp of 
parsippany nj and omaha public power district of omaha neb 
disclosed the agreements in response to an nrc inquiry last spring 
aimed at determining if such deals are common in the industry 
congress has criticized the nrc for failing to explicitly outlaw 
such settlements 
the controversy stemmed from a senate investigation last spring 
of two labor settlements between builders of the comanche peak 
nuclear power plant in texas and workers who received payments in 
return for keeping quiet about potential safety hazards 
the labor department later ruled that such settlement provisions 
were unacceptable but the nrc commissioners have been unable to 
agree how and whether to outlaw them 
in april the nrc sent letters to all nuclear utilities and 
their contractors asking to be told of any labor settlements that 
restricted an employees ability to report safety information to 
the nrc 
a review monday of the written responses from the utilities and 
contractors showed all denied having any such restrictions 
however the three companies said they had settlements with 
provisions that might be construed by others as limiting a workers 
ability to raise safety concerns 
duke power was the only utility to provide specific information 
about a settlement it said it felt compelled to report the case to 
the nrc in light of the sensitivity of the issue even though 
it believes the settlement was proper 
the case involves an april 21 1988 settlement with former 
employee howard samuel nunn jr who filed a civil suit against 
duke after he was dismissed in october 1983 
in a passage similar to a provision of the comanche peak 
settlement the duke settlement stipulated that nunn will not 
voluntarily appear as a witness in any legal or administrative 
proceeding involving duke it also said he would not seek to 
induce any government agency to take any action against duke 
duke told the nrc these passages were designed to settle the 
nunn suit the deal clearly left mr nunn free to bring any 
concerns to the nrc if he so desired duke wrote to the 
commission 
duke said it wrote to nunn in july saying he is free to bring 
any safety matter to the nrc duke operates three plants in north 
carolina and south carolina 
gpu nuclear and omaha public power in separate letters to the 
nrc said that while they found no restrictive clauses in their 
labor settlements the language in four settlement agreements might 
be viewed as restricting the individuals ability to raise 
potential safety issues with the nrc 
the utilities provided no details but said they advised the 
people involved to disregard any settlement language that they 
thought limited their ability to raise safety issues 
gpu nuclear owns the three mile island nuclear station in 
pennsylvania and the oyster creek plant in new jersey omaha public 
power owns the fort calhoun nuclear plant in nebraska 
bob newlin an nrc spokesman said monday the commission wrote 
letters to people involved in questionable settlements a few of 
them wrote back to the nrc about safety issues but newlin said he 
could not provide details 
five other companies said that while they saw no problems with 
any of their labor settlement deals they wrote to people involved 
in 11 cases to emphasize that they were under no limits in 
contacting the nrc about safety issues 
the five are pacific gas amp electric co of san francisco 
houston lighting and power co georgia power co of atlanta 
carolina power amp light co of raleigh nc and bechtel corp of

the nations thrift institutions allowed 51 
billion to drain from savings accounts in august a move an analyst 
says is a positive sign 
shrinkage is the order of the day said bert ely a private 
thrift analyst in alexandria va its the only effective way 
that marginal sampls can meet the higher capital requirements 
thrift legislation signed aug 9 by president bush requires 
institutions to hold more capital for every loan or other 
investment they make 
if an institution cannot earn enough profits to add to capital 
or raise it from outside investors its only alternative is to 
scale back operations before the new standards go into effect dec 
7 
deposit outflows which dont include interest credited to 
savers accounts totaled 51 billion compared with an inflow of 
54 million in july it was the highest level of withdrawals since 
53 billion left thrift accounts in april the office of thrift 
supervision reported 
james barth chief economist of the thrift office said the 
deposit outflow as well as a record 134 billion reduction in 
assets largely reflected a deliberate strategy by the industry 
this was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed 
assets to adjust to the new regulatory environment barth said 
thrift holdings of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities fell 
by 78 billion in august while cash and investment securities 
dropped 3 billion 
the data shows that mortgages originated by thrifts rose to 
164 billion in august up from a sixyear low of 132 billion in 
july however the institutions are selling an increasing 
proportion of the mortgages to investors and retaining fewer in 
their portfolios 
savers withdrew a record 108 billion from thrifts in january 
and net withdrawals have exceeded 1 billion in every month except 
july in the first eight months of the year 445 billion drained 
from thrifts august marked the 15th month of withdrawals in the 16 
months beginning in may 1988 
the earlier outflows were attributed to interest rates which 
were rising through the spring and to depositor uncertainty about 
the sampl bailout 
with the august report the thrift office for the first time 
began reporting separate statistics for insolvent sampls under 
government control and the rest of the industry 
the 264 thrifts taken over by the government by the end of 
august for instance had net withdrawals of 12 billion in 
august compared with an inflow of 187 million in july 
the 2657 other thrifts had withdrawals of 39 billion up from 
133 million a month earlier

the average american adult can get along on as 
little as 500 milligrams of salt a day far less than the usual 
diet contains the national research council says 
although no optimal range of salt intake has been established 
there is no known advantage in consuming large amounts of sodium 
and clear disadvantages for those susceptible to hypertension 
the council said in an update of its nutritional recommendations 
the nrcs 10th edition of its recommended dietary allowances 
published today also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 
milligrams of vitamin c per day as opposed to 60 milligrams for 
adult nonsmokers 
smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin 
leading to lower concentrations in the blood said the nrc 
the new guidelines also say pregnant women should increase 
vitamin c to 70 milligrams a day 
the new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient 
recommendations in nearly 10 years the rdas are a major guide for 
developing nutrition programs and policies 
there are a lot of little changes up and down but not 
earthshaking said michael jacobson executive director for the 
center for science in the public interest a health advocacy group 
one of the noteworthy changes he said is the one on sodium 
this marks the first time this committee or any other official 
committee suggested so low a number jacobson said they are 
telling americans what is optimal not whats convenient 
about 75 percent of the sodium consumed by americans comes from 
processed food a typical serving of canned soup has almost 1000 
milligrams of sodium as flavoring jacobson said a fastfood 
cheeseburger has 1400 milligrams 
he said previous recommendations specified 1100 to 3300 
milligrams of sodium a day for adults 
the new recommendations are not daily objectives but rather 
goals to be met over time 
in planning meals or food supplies said the nrc it is 
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a 
single days diet that contains all the rdas for all the 
nutrients 
rdas are defined as levels of essential nutrients that are 
adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all 
healthy persons people with special nutritional needs are not 
covered by the rdas 
the recommended allowances are intended to be consumed as part 
of a normal diet the nrc said they are neither minimal 
requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of intake 
rdas are used in a number of ways by different groups the 
department of agriculture for instance uses them to evaluate the 
adequacy of the us food supply for setting standards for food 
assistance programs and determining the nutritional status of the 
us population 
most average americans come in contact most often with the 
nutrition information listed on the sides of breakfast cereal 
boxes they are derived from the rdas 
the new volume leaves most previous recommendations unchanged or 
modified only slightly but it includes some important changes 
instead of basing rdas for adults on arbitrary heights and weights 
allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in the 
population 
the rda for vitamin b12 an essential nutrient for maintaining 
normal metabolism and function of the bloodforming organs was 
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2 micrograms 
the new edition lists recommended allowances for protein 11 
vitamins and 7 minerals it points out that besides known 
nutrients food contains thousands of other naturally occurring 
substances of nutritional value 
a varied diet meeting rdas said the subcommittee of the 
food and nutrition board of the nrc will probably be adequate in 
all other nutrients

the lawyer who will represent rep barney 
frank before the house ethics committee says the massachusetts 
democrat will defend himself against false allegations 
hes chastened by the events that are true but hes damned if 
hes going to run from allegations that are garbage stephen 
sachs said in an interview monday 
barneys been forthcoming about this publicly he is equally 
certain that there has been a substantial amount of untruth 
peddled or attempted to be peddled in the public press 
sachs a former us attorney in baltimore and former maryland 
attorney general said he would be ready by early next week to 
present a detailed case that will debunk some of the sexrelated 
charges leveled against the fiveterm lawmaker 
sachs hiring was the latest move by frank indicating a renewed 
feistiness after several weeks in which friends said he was 
emotionally down about his prospects 
frank took to the house floor last week for the first time since 
the allegations about his relations with a male prostitute became 
public in august he has maintained a full schedule in his home 
district and has begun a legal defense fund set up by political 
aides 
doug cahn a spokesman for franks congressional office 
declined to disclose how much had been contributed to the fund 
saying the first public report on the account is due at years end 
a leading liberal in congress frank has admitted paying stephen 
gobie 80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal 
funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver from july 1985 through 
august 1987 
frank had acknowledged he is homosexual well before the recent 
publicity 
gobie has leveled various charges against frank that the 
congressman has denied among those are that frank knew gobie was 
running a prostitution ring from franks capitol hill apartment and 
that gobie and frank engaged in sexual activity at the house 
gymnasium 
the house ethics committee investigating the frank case plans to 
conclude its deliberations by the end of the year sachs said 
basing his statement on two meetings with the committees legal 
counsel and one with the minority counsel 
they want very much to act promptly and want to conclude the 
matter this year sachs said 
members of franks staff said they expect the case to come up at 
least in a preliminary form at a committee meeting later this week 
a spokesman for the ethics committee said the panels schedule for 
this week had not been set by monday and that committee proceedings 
and the agenda are kept confidential 
sachs has prosecuted several members of congress and recently 
gained attention for his defense of dr elizabeth morgan who spent 
two years in jail after being cited for contempt of court for 
refusing to allow her daughter to visit the childs father

most farmers who planted a second crop after 
freezing weather and drought destroyed their winter wheat or cotton 
are still waiting for disaster relief checks from the agriculture 
department says sen phil gramm 
for people who are waiting for their checks this is getting 
to be a problem and im eager to do something said gramm 
rtexas 
gramm and other great plains lawmakers contend usdas 
regulations implementing an 895 million drought relief bill 
unfairly cut payments to farmers who planted a second crop 
usda officials said monday that farmers who rotated their 
traditional spring crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by 
drought or freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments 
it doesnt solve the problem most people have with their 
second crop gramm said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas called the decision by the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service good news but 
agreed it doesnt go far enough in reversing usda regulations that 
would cut disaster assistance to many other farmers who had also 
planted a second crop 
a senate aide said the usdas decision monday apparently applies 
only to winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second 
crop such as milo on nonwheat acres in the spring 
those farmers who planted their second crop on the wheat acres 
instead to take advantage of fertilizer already on the land wont 
see their disaster checks cut the aide said 
the decision doesnt cover hundreds of cotton farmers who also 
planted a second crop or farmers who planted nontraditional 
second crops on their wheat acreage or in addition to their wheat 
acreage officials said 
legislators and usda have been wrangling over the regulations on 
ghost acres for two months and one senate aide said the 
decision came because we had to force their hand on this 
bentsen said farmers from texas kansas oklahoma and elsewhere 
on the great plains planted milo or cotton on their failed wheat 
acres this year but were told by ascs that their disaster checks 
would be reduced if they instead planted their spring cotton or 
milo crops on the winter wheat land 
had they planted the spring crop normally without rotating it 
to the failed wheat acres there would be no reduction in the 
disaster checks bentsen said it is obviously unfair to 
penalize farmers when they are following normal farming practices

committee says hell talk with agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter and mexican agriculture secretary jorge de la vega on 
wednesday about mexicos refusal to accept livestock from privately 
operated inspection centers 
rep kika de la garza dtexas and sen phil gramm rtexas 
raised their concerns about the bottlenecks at texas centers with

the mexican government will accept only livestock that has been 
inspected at one of five texas state operated facilities along the 
border though 23 privately run pens are available 
gramm said the state facilities operate only during normal 
business hours while slaughter livestock are typically shipped 
through commercial facilities at any time of night or day 
my people dont want to be forced to deal with the government 
when private pens are available gramm said monday 
we have sent clear signals to the mexican embassy that there 
is going to be congressional action unless they can come back 
and deal with what they perceive to be a small problem gramm 
said 
steve poore a spokesman for usdas animal and plant health 
inspection service said the five pens in texas are the only 
shipment facilities on the 2000mile border formally approved by 
mexico although a few animals may have been shipped unofficially 
at other points 
the agency has suggested that mexico consider approving about 30 
other pens in california arizona new mexico and texas 
mexico is going to inspect the pens we have suggested and 
decide which ones to approve he said 
janna evans another agency spokeswoman said mexico may make a 
decision within a week to 10 days

the food and drug administration is halting 
the shipment of all chinese mushrooms into the united states 
citing a bacteria contamination that can cause severe food 
poisoning 
the order extends a ban issued in may 
very little got into the marketplace fda spokesman emil 
corwin said monday after the agency ordered all mushrooms detained 
at us ports 
most of the known contamination involved 68ounce 
institutionalsize cans banned in may when the fda ordered the cans 
detained at ports after food poisoning outbreaks in new york 
mississippi and pennsylvania 
the february and april foodpoison outbreaks caused 100 
illnesses and sent at least 16 people to hospitals the illnesses 
were linked to chinese mushrooms used by two restaurants a 
hospital and on a college campus recalls began in march 
the agency said monday that it had identified the contamination 
staphyloccocal enterotoxin in 55ounce and 16ounce cans of 
mushrooms produced by 10 plants in china 
all of those products have been recalled or are being recalled 
the fda said 
in an oct 13 letter to the chinese government the agency 
warned that the restrictions would remain until manufacturing 
changes are made 
corwin said the chinese mushrooms dont carry brand names when 
they are sent to the united states and are used mostly by food 
processing plants some importers may add their own brand names on 
cans sold to groceries 
chinese mushrooms account for half of the nations imported 
mushrooms corwin said however richard sullivan executive vice 
president of the association of food industries said that since 
the fdas may restrictions chinese imports have dropped to 8 
percent of the market 
enterotoxin produced by staphyloccocus aureus bacteria can 
survive the high temperatures used during canning the fda said 
symptoms of staphyloccocal enterotoxin food poisoning such as 
nausea vomiting and abdominal cramping can develop rapidly after 
eating a contaminated product most victims recover in two to three 
days 
the fda said the following code numbers appear on cans affected 
on 68ounce cans tm t3 t17 m2 b2 lt q15 and r12 
on 16ounce cans t1 or t17 
on 55ounce cans q1

federal funds may not be used for material 
judged to be obscene by two government agencies under a bill 
signed by president bush 
the bill became the focal point of dispute in congress because 
of protests over the use of taxpayer money to display robert 
mapplethorpes photographs with homosexual subjects and andres 
serranos photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine 
the measure signed monday stipulates that federal funds may 
not be used for materials judged to be obscene by the national 
endowment of the arts and the national endowment of the humanities 
the 114 billion interior department spending bill for fiscal 
1990 also bars oil and gas drilling in 84 million acres off the 
shores of california alaska the gulf of mexico near floridas 
everglades and the east coast 
bush expressed reservations about extending for another year the 
moratorium on oil and gas leasing and exploration on the outer 
continental shelf however he said the overall benefits of the 
bill outweighed his concerns 
rep ralph s regula rohio the ranking republican on the 
house appropriations subcommittee on the interior praised the 
action on obscene art and said he shared bushs reservation on the 
restrictions on offshore drilling 
were up to about 50 percent plus imported oil now to meet our 
needs im not for drilling every square foot theres fragile 
areas off of florida and california we should protect but 
there are other areas that logically should be drilled and are 
still included in the moratoria for aesthetic reasons 
the moratorium means we cant look at these 84 million acres 
even in the event of a national energy emergency he said

since president carlos salinas de gortari 
took office special agents have arrested more than 6000 federal 
employees on charges ranging from extortion to embezzlement and tax 
evasion a top law enforcement official says 
hector castaneda jimenez chief prosecutor at the attorney 
generals office said monday that an estimated 828 million in 
government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the 
11month campaign to root out official corruption 
as part of the campaign castanedas office will issue warrants 
during the next six months for the arrest of another 10000 federal 
employees suspected of illegally gaining an estimated 3768 
million the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the independent 
news service excelsior 
it is a difficult job but not impossible castaneda said 
and federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount the 
rest will probably not be recoverable either because the status of 
limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time 
in jail rather than return the money 
salinas took office dec 1 for a sixyear term

israeli forces that hold a security belt in the south 
the prosyrian mainstream shiite amal militia and the 
proiranian fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god which is

on the program the mammography program would initially cost 60 
million but would ultimately save millions of dollars through early

the night before buck helm unknowingly 
drove his aging car into a concrete death trap the burly 
longshoreman slept as usual in the rusty yellow panel truck he kept 
parked by the docks coworkers said 
the morning before he defied death at the hands of a killer 
earthquake hed been a winner at tonk the card game of the docks 
played at a quarter a hand 
at 504 pm on oct 17 the magnitude 69 earthquake caused a 
1milelong section of interstate 880 to cave in around him 
killing dozens of motorists and pinning helm across the front seat 
of his tiny chevrolet sprint for the next 90 hours he remained 
trapped under the crumbled concrete 
on monday the 57yearold survivor surprised his doctors at 
highland general hospital by nodding his head to indicate he felt 
no pain 
dr floyd huen medical director of the hospital said helms 
condition could be upgraded from very serious to serious if he 
continued recovering at the present rate 
when he was asked about whether he was hurting anywhere he 
shook his head and everbody was incredulous huen said 
after work a week ago today helm jumped into his silver sprint 
and drove into what would become the heart of the disaster 
according to a ships clerk at the port of oaklands charles p 
howard terminal 
four days later astonished rescue workers pulled him out of the 
crumbled interstate 
helms children and former wife have been at the hospital since 
he was rescued saturday 
buck and i was married 16 years and we have some beautiful 
children said his exwife lorrie flanked by daughter desiree 
12 sons jeffery 16 and marc 22 and marcs fiancee audra 
weve always been the best of friends no matter what 
hes always been there when i needed him she told 
reporters this is when he needs us 
desiree was afraid her father had been killed because he hadnt 
called to say he was safe 
marc is waiting for the day his father comes home and tells the 
kids to clean house the way he used to or goes back to building a 
rock wall in the yard 
im sure when he was in there he was saying theres no way 
marc said he is sure his father kept repeating my daughter 
shes going to get married some day shes going to graduate my 
sons in college my other sons going to be going to college 
just no way he was going to give up marc said 
helm 5foot11 and 230 pounds cant talk because a respirator 
tube has been run down his throat 
after a news conference helms exwife took a 15minute tour of 
the freeway where her former husband survived beyond all odds she 
was escorted by police officers 
she said oh my god i dont see how anyone could make it 
out alive and then she reflected on it a minute and said well 
if anyone could buck could said police sgt jack huth 
fellow dockworkers disagreed as to whether helm was headed to 
the oaks clubroom in neighboring emeryville where he played 
lowball poker once a week or to berkeley where he enjoyed exotic 
foods 
basil parker a ships clerk passed helm on the freeway on his 
way home to berkeley before he heard the roar and saw the clouds of 
dust behind him after the freeway caved in 
if he was going to the oaks he would have just gone up market 
to san pablo parker said i would have to assume the man was 
going to berkeley 
wherever he was headed it was in a tiny car that had more than 
200000 miles on it because of all the weekend trips hed made to 
visit his family in weaverville 250 miles north of san francisco 
coworkers said 
youd look at it and think that any collision would kill the 
occupant said ralph bucher chief clerk at the terminal where 
helm works 
helm also kept a panel truck at the docks and slept in it many a 
night on the left side of the truck they said helm had painted 
in orange the words weaverville flash referring to the 
northern california logging town 
on the right side he painted a cartoon bunny and desirees 
delight after the daughter he called his rabbit 
inside helm had a mattress a snoopy sleeping bag two alarm 
clocks some clothes and a panel of photographs of his children 
including one of desiree in a huge pair of football shoulderpads 
he has tried living down in this area bucher said he 
basically figured that rather than being in business for himself he 
was better off with that weekly paycheck and acted to go back to 
the mountains and go through the routine of commuting on weekends 
to and from and basically living on the docks during the week

the editor of the soviet unions most popular 
newspaper says communist officials want to scare the press into 
toeing the party line by making an example of him for straying 
but vladislav a starkov says he will resist pressure to quit 
the editorinchief of the weekly arguments and facts appealed 
to western public opinion on monday from the office president 
mikhail s gorbachev had suggested he vacate 
its a great injustice and a violation of all my journalistic 
rights starkov said in an interview of the attack on how he has 
run the paper 
he said he was the victim of unspecified high party officials 
who were trying to make an example of him to frighten the whole 
press 
starkov said officials have forced him to cancel a planned trip 
to canada on saturday and that he was afraid he might also have to 
forgo a trip to new york scheduled for oct 25 
eleven days ago gorbachev criticized several top soviet editors 
as inflaming passions and hurting reform efforst by allegedly 
overplaying the countrys economic and ethnic troubles 
he reportedly said starkov should resign over a poll his paper 
carried implying that human rights activist andrei d sakharov is 
more popular than gorbachev 
mikhail sergeyevich told me that in my place he would 
resign said starkov but i took it as a warning not a direct 
firing order 
despite this starkov reiterated his strong support for 
perestroika gorbachevs program of economic and political reform 
the most insulting thing for me in all this is that im being 
considered almost an enemy of gorbachev or an enemy of 
perestroika he said there was never anything like that 
starkov said however that officials have not been suffiently 
making clear the proper line the press should take 
there is a struggle on i understand im a victim of that 
struggle and arguments and facts fell between the stones of a 
treadmill 
the stocky 49yearold editor who has headed arguments and 
facts for 10 years said that although the weekly had made mistakes 
he stands behind it 
the soviet press has carried only one vaguely worded story about 
the closeddoor meeting at which gorbachev rebuked the editors and 
nothing at all about the call for starkov to resign 
arguments and facts is published by znaniye russian for 
knowledge a national society that sponsors lectures books 
and periodicals and is not under direct government control but 
starkov said the ruling communist party could order znaniye to fire 
him 
he would not specify who was pressing him to resign but he said 
party officials were trying to get him to agree to a promotion 
to the state publishing committee or the parliament 
the arguments and facts staff of 20 reporters and editors and 
was surprised their newspaper was picked out for censure said 
deputy editorinchief alexander meshchersky 
we not only criticize but try to find solutions he said 
if we have pursued an erroneous editorial policy then 26 million 
people are wrong 
with a circulation of 26 million and annual profit of about 39 
million arguments and facts is the most widely read soviet 
newspaper 
it aims to tell people what they want to know from rumors of a 
price hike on gasoline to the history of soviet espionage

an upper section of the bay bridge that 
crashed onto a lower deck in last weeks earthquake is too badly 
damaged to be used again state transportation officials said 
its too bent up and unsuitable said jim larson spokesman 
for the california department of transportation but he added the 
decision monday to build a new section wont add any time to the 
estimated four weeks that the main link between oakland and san 
francisco will be closed 
the damaged upper section is 74 feet long and 50 feet wide and 
weighs 200 tons the section was cut in half by concrete saws and 
blow torches beginning saturday to make it easier to move 
workers on monday completed the dangerous job of removing the 
upper section by crane and lowering it 200 feet to a barge the two 
pieces were shipped to nearby alameda 
workers also lowered part of the bottom deck that was damaged 
and cracked when the upper deck collapsed onto it and planned to 
complete that project today 
for four weeks and perhaps longer thousands of commuters who 
depend on the bridge will have to find alternate routes across san 
francisco bay 
the 85milelong bridge which opened in 1936 normally carries 
260000 vehicles per day officials say repairs will cost up to 1 
million 
nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge with the 
upper deck dangling like an open trap door provided the first 
graphic illustration of the magnitude of the 69 richter scale 
quake one woman died when she drove her car into the gap 
the bridge also had been in the logo created for the 1989 world 
series between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics 
but its closure contributed to sundays decision to delay 
resumption of the championship until friday as officials attempt 
to reduce traffic problems

in prison for marketing videos featuring porn actress traci lords 
when she was in her teens

before receiving the prison term monday 
my life has been probably the worst its ever been the last 
three years he told us district judge david v kenyon 
please dont send me to jail 
but kenyon said gottesman clearly had opted for profit over 
restraint by distributing the videos 
gottesman the judge said was too enamored of the almighty 
dollar and lacked the fiber or the character to say i wont 
be involved in that kind of thing i will not participate in making 
that kind of thing happen 
kenyon also imposed a 100000 fine on gottesmans company 
xcitement video inc and a 650000 suspended fine 
kenyon ruled in june that gottesman knew miss lords was still a 
minor when she appeared in the films lust in the fast lane 
sex shoot and screaming desire 
miss lords born may 7 1968 allegedly had used false 
identification to get work in sex films beginning in 1984 she 
appeared in dozens of movies before she was 18 
gottesmans attorney stanley fleischman argued at trial that 
the child pornography law under which his client was convicted was 
unconstitutional we will win in my opinion on appeal he

orlando set the price at 1935 million which he ordered the 
state to pay to robert k mclaughlin 29 the judge blamed an error 
in identification and an overzealous police officer for 
mclaughlins unjust conviction and incarceration 
mclaughlin was charged with murder robbery and weapons 
possession for a december 1979 killing in new york city the victim 
was killed fending off a robber according to court papers 
a jury had convicted mclaughlin of robbery and murder and 
sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison 
his conviction was upheld by the appellate division of state 
supreme court the states highest court the court of appeals 
refused to hear the case 
but court records say mclaughlins foster father harold hohne 
succeeded in showing authorities that mclaughlin had nothing to do 
with the crime in 1986 and he was released

atlantis five astronauts were home 
with most of today off while their amazingly clean spaceship 
remained in california for servicing after a successful mission 
that sent the galileo to jupiter 
the galileo probe said to be operating flawlessly has traveled 
more than 11 million miles since deployment about 6 hours after 
wednesdays blastoff the 15billion nuclearpowered probes 
24billionmile trip will take six years 
the longdelayed odyssey to jupiter will include one sweep past 
venus and two by earth to gain momentum from the planets gravity 
once it reaches jupiter galileo will fire a probe into the jovian 
atmosphere and then orbit the largest planet for 22 months 
atlantis returned to earth on monday with a pictureperfect 
landing that occurred three hours early at edwards air force base 
calif to avoid higher winds predicted for the afternoon winds 
moments before touchdown were only about 4 mph 
atlantis congratulations on an outstanding mission ken 
cameron radioed from the johnson space center in houston youve 
extended the shuttles reach to the outer planets 
its nice to be home replied shuttle commander donald e 
williams who guided the 97ton winged spaceship to a pinpoint 
landing on a hard clay runway in the mojave desert 
the 932 am pdt landing ended a 17 millionmilemission that 
unofficially lasted 4 days 23 hours and 41 minutes the missions 
main purpose was launching galileo which scientists hope will find 
clues to the formation of the universe and provide the best look 
yet at another planet 
about 20000 people were at edwards to watch the landing the 
crowd was small compared to past touchdowns because of the weekday 
landing officials said 
about 45 minutes after landing the astronauts emerged from the 
shuttle and performed the traditional walkaround inspection with 
nasa officials the other crew members are pilot mike mcculley and 
mission specialists ellen baker shannon lucid and franklin 
changdiaz 
the vehicle looks amazingly clean said william lenoir an 
acting associate administrator of the national aeronautics and 
space administration we did not see with a quick inspection 
any significant tile damage a little nick here and a nick there 
the black tiles protect the shuttle during its fiery reentry 
into the atmosphere 
later in the afternoon the astronauts left edwards aboard two 
gulfstream jets for their home base in houston 
the crew members and their spouses arrived at houstons 
ellington field at about 630 pm where they were greeted by 
their children and 300 cheering friends and coworkers 
this is obviously one of the highest points in my life so 
far williams told the crowd its super 
the astronauts have most of today off but were expected to the 
space center this afternoon to look over film they took during 
their mission said spokesman jeff carr they return to work 
wednesday to begin a week of formal briefings about their flight 
atlantis will ride piggyback on a modified boeing 747 for a 
twoday trip to cape canaveral fla this weekend 
after deploying galileo the crew turned their attention to 
several science and medical experiments including one that

slogging through muddy tent 
encampments teeming with earthquake refugees evangelist billy 
graham told frightened victims not to let their faith be rattled 
i think we have to recognize that god is a god of love and he 
doesnt allow a thing like this to happen without a purpose the 
preacher said while traveling by a salvation army sedan 
i dont know what the purpose is its a mystery to me ive 
never figured out all these disasters from the biblical point of 
view 
watsonville mayor elizabeth murphy met with graham at the citys 
disaster center where the preacher led a brief prayer of thanks 
for all the volunteers who have worked to salvage what remains of 
the community 
the mayor said she was pleased graham came we want to get 
people in the churches we feel it does a great deal to get another 
power to help you out she said 
salvation army disaster capt jeni gregory described pockets 
of misery in dozens of small tent cities sprinkled throughout 
this agricultural community she said there could be as many as 
5000 refugees many of them homeless but many just too frightened 
to go back to their homes despite inspections declaring them safe 
an agricultural community of 27000 watsonville is known as the 
hub that produces much of the nations lettuce and salad greens it 
took a big hit when the 69magnitude quake struck a week ago 
today a total of 175 homes were destroyed 930 homes were damaged 
17 commercial buildings were destroyed and 47 businesses sustained 
damage 
residential damage was placed at 88 million structural damage 
to businesses at 34 million 
graham shook hands with dozens of people waiting for food monday 
in a pouring rain outside a salvation army distributiton center 
many had only cardboard boxes for umbrellas and plastic food wrap 
for raincoats 
we appreciate you coming here said mario guzman 34 
later graham flew to oakland where he gave the salvation army a 
100000 check for earthquake relief and toured the site of the 
collapsed interstate 880 
yes sir theres somebody up there thats stronger than we are 
and stronger than anything we can build the evangelist remarked 
as he gazed up at the concrete rubble 
he called the disaster almost an unbelievable thing and 
said its a miracle to me there werent more people killed than 
there were 
glancing at a nearby section of freeway deemed so dangerous it 
must be leveled graham said it makes me think of the tower of 
babel and how it came crashing down 
but he said he did not mean to suggest the tragedy was gods 
judgment these are natural disasters graham said

former fbi agent richard miller imprisoned 
since 1986 won permission for his release on 357000 bail while 
he awaits a new trial on charges he handed over secrets to his 
soviet lover 
us district judge david kenyon set bail on the order of the 
9th us circuit court of appeals which ruled that miller had not 
been shown to be a flight risk 
the spirit of the order of the appeals court is that they 
directed this court to set a bond that mr miller can meet 
kenyon said at a hearing monday 
miller was ordered returned to los angeles from the federal 
prison in rochester minn while papers are processed for his 
release 
his brother sister and a friend agreed to post property worth 
357757 to assure his appearance at court proceedings kenyon did 
not require that any cash be posted 
were pleased that he will be getting out defense attorney 
stanley greenberg said outside court its a little later than we 
would have liked but better late than never 
kenyon scheduled a hearing for monday to determine when millers 
third espionage trial will be held the first jury deadlocked in 
1985 a second jury convicted him in june 1986 and kenyon 
sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years 
millers conviction was reversed in april on grounds that jurors 
were allowed to hear too much about lie detector tests that miller 
failed 
kenyon at first refused to allow millers release on bail 
saying he might flee but the appeals court disagreed 
the corpulent miller who battled the fbi over his weight and 
other problems during a lackluster 20year career with the agency 
was depicted by prosecutors at his trial as a bitter vengeful 
failure easily recruited as a soviet spy 
his attorneys said miller was a wellmeaning fbi misfit who 
dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a soviet spy 
network 
among those who testified against him was a codefendant 
svetlana ogorodnikov who became his lover and allegedly enticed 
him into spying mrs ogorodnikov and her husband nikolay pleaded 
guilty to spying and are serving prison terms 
miller was excommunicated by the mormon church his wife paula 
divorced him following his conviction and has since remarried she 
was last reported living in the philippines some of their eight 
children continue to live with their mother greenberg said and at 
least two are on mormon missions overseas 
under terms of his release miller would be placed in the 
custody of albert sayers a former fbi agent and private 
investigator who worked on the defense 
miller also will be forbidden to leave the los angeles area 
without permission

while santa cruz was the epicenter of that disaster los

told members of the academy of television arts amp sciences 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
told a group of studio executives they should help fight the war on 
drugs by sending antidrug messages to their viewers 
it seems to me we can do better than pablum and better 
than good entertainment he said monday i am not the cultural 
commissar it is your business to decide what is on your shows 
he said progress has been made in the depiction of drugs on 
television and in movies with illegal substances being portrayed 
unfavorably 
he also praised the efforts of hollywood to set an example of 
chic sobriety but said that for every glamour capital there 
is a watts 
following his speech bennett was asked by entertainer ben 
vereen if he believed antidrug messages delivered by former drug 
abusers were sending mixed messages to children vereen is a former 
drug abuser who recently has visited elementary schools to urge 
pupils to stay off drugs 
i think kids need to hear what hell has been like bennett 
said but they also need to hear from people who have never used

investigators are looking at 
atmospheric turbulence during the difficult approach to 
tegucigalpas airport as a possible cause of a plane crash that 
killed 131 people sources close to the probe say 
some sources say an atmospheric phenomenon called a rolling 
wave which can occur when wind whistles over mountains could 
have created a severe downdraft or turbulence that left the plane 
1800 feet below its assigned altitude before saturdays crash 
copilot reiniero canales in an interview on honduran radio 
said the boeing 727 was making a normal approach on instruments 
through clouds when suddenly we hit something it was all so 
fast we didnt have time to react 
the crash of tansahsa flight 414 which originated in san jose 
costa rica with a stopover in managua nicaragua killed 131 people 
and left 15 survivors including pilot and copilot 
the us embassy said 12 americans were presumed dead the three 
american survivors have been airlifted to hospitals in the united 
states and all are expected to survive 
investigators questioned tower and air control workers and made 
an aerial survey of the crash site monday 
the site heavily damaged by looters was cleared late monday to 
allow inspection by a team from the national transportation safety 
board boeing co and pratt amp whitney the engine manufacturer 
the investigators also planned to question the crew of the last 
previous plane to land at tegucigalpa to see if they also 
experienced turbulence 
barry trotter leader of the us team emphasized that he was 
in honduras to assist the hondurans in conducting the investigation 
they are giving us every facility to help them he said 
relatives of the dead continued to gather at the morgue as 
forensic experts tried to identify charred corpses the sandinista 
air force sent a plane to pick up the bodies of nicaraguan victims 
relatives also pored over the wreckage as the search for remains 
continued one man burst into tears when he found a photo of wife 
the honduran minister of defense col wilfredo sanchez looking 
gaunt and unshaven was at the site for a second straight day 
searching for his daughter fannys personal effects 
im not here to direct im just looking he said clicking 
a set of charred keys in his hands 
when sanchez whose son was killed in an air force accident last 
year spotted a suspected looter he grabbed the man and ordered 
police to get him out of my sight 
col marco tulio rivera head of the honduran civil aeronautics 
authority said pilot raul argueta radioed the tower at 752 am 
that he was at 7500 feet seven miles from the airport precisely 
on target 
the pilot was supposed to descend to 6700 feet at the fivemile 
mark 1800 feet above the 4900foot cerro de hule 
what happened in those last few seconds is what we have to 
figure out said rivera who added that argueta had not yet been 
interviewed because of his injuries 
sources familiar with the investigation speaking on condition 
of anonymity said other causes being looked at included possible 
engine failure or a false altimeter reading 
rivera said it was unlikely that a piece of the planes roof 
might have blown off as happened to an aloha air jet over hawaii 
in 1988 
a boeing co spokesman said the plane which was leased from 
contiental airlines had taken off and landed 52019 times about 
average for a 21yearold plane a high number of takeoffanding 
cycles has sometimes been seen as a factor in accidents caused 
by metal fatigue 
sources said repeated accounts of severe turbulence before the 
crash jibed with the theory of a rolling wave downdraft 
they explained that the 50 mph wind flowing south over the cerro 
de hule would follow the contour of the land until it hit another 
mountain behind the cerro the wind could then be pushed up and 
over itself turning in violent eddies that cause an airplane to 
lose lift and drop thousands of feet in seconds 
the approach to tegucigalpa is notorious among veteran central 
american travelers because the airport is set at the bottom of a 
ring of mountains as if it were at the bottom of a soup bowl and 
the mountains are frequently obscured by racing clouds 
its a pretty hairy approach said one source familiar with 
the probe

a 7yearold boy slumping in a chair 
and holding his mothers hand was ordered to stand trial on a rape 
charge in an attack on a 12yearold girl 
the 7 year old and two 12yearold boys all from ypsilanti 
face one count each of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct 
involving accomplices assistant prosecutor john stanowski said 
monday after probate judge john kirkendall set nov 22 as the trial 
date 
two other defendants boys ages 7 and 9 didnt appear at their 
arraignment last week and were being sought said the washtenaw 
county assistant prosecutor 
this is not sexual experimentation between two young people of 
the opposite sex stanowski said this is a gangtype offense 
two were holding her down while the third one knew the private 
areas of a woman and was fondling and molesting her 
i was aghast that kids that age were involved stanowski 
said 
robert reizner a lawyer for the 7 year old said his client was 
too young to face charges 
there is a commonlaw presumption that children under the age 
of 6 are conclusively presumed not to be able to have any criminal 
intent reizner said this child at the time of the alleged 
event was maybe a month and a half over 7 years old 
the attack occurred july 16 authorities said the girl was 
knocked down and kicked in the head stanowski said during the 
attack the girls 11yearold cousin tried to stop the boys but 
they fended her off stanowski said 
if these kids were adults they would be facing life 
stanowski said because they are juveniles theres a whole 
different avenue the court may take as far as the disposition 
stanowski said the boys could be put on probation and ordered to 
undergo counseling placed in foster homes or assigned to 
inpatient mental health care if they are convicted 
stanowski said one of the 12yearold boys also is charged with 
assault with a dangerous weapon in a knife attack on the same girl 
in august

radar station 
the power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against 
mistakes its important not to hide them to admit them and 
correct them 
in this respect the krasnoyarsk radar installation issue is 
very significant it took us four years to get to the bottom of it 
we were charged with violation of the abm treaty because of the 
station it took the government quite a while to learn all the 
truth of the project finally we saw it clearly the station had 
been built on the wrong site not where it should have been 
all these years we have been working hard to keep up the abm 
treaty as a foundation for strategic stability we have been 
looking for options and having very complicated debates on the 
interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements 
contents 
and all the while there stood the station the size of an 
egyptian pyramid representing to put it bluntly a violation of 
the abm treaty 
at last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle 
the station this has brought some discontent in the country as if 
we were forgoing our own interests 
in fact we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons and were gaining 
the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of 
american installations in greenland and england which were 
modernized we understand in violation of the treaty

a special legislative session will be called 
in the next 14 days to evaluate earthquake damage and arrange for 
relief that could include a temporary increase in sales or gasoline 
taxes the governor said 
after meeting with top lawmakers for 90 minutes monday 
deukmejian said we certainly did discuss that referring to 
the tax increases 
the final decision on that will depend in large part on the 
extent of the damages together with the expected action of the 
federal government he said 
the earthquake struck the san francisco bay area a week ago 
today killing dozens injuring thousands and causing up to 7 
billion damage 
the governor said he would meet with assembly speaker willie 
brown and senate majority leader david roberti both democrats 
senate minority leader ken maddy and assembly minority leader ross 
johnson next monday to try to put together a special session agenda 
the appropriations committee of the us house of 
representatives approved a 285 billion aid package monday 1 
billion less than the amount sought by californias congressional 
delegation 
the governor said he and legislative leaders discussed the 
possibility of holding an earlier special election to consider a 
ballot measure currently slated for june 1990 that proposal would 
liberalize the states spending limit and pave the way for a 
gradual 9cent gasoline tax increase 
but he said no decision had been made on that question 
the state temporarily raised the gasoline tax twice during the 
1960s to repair roads damaged by storms and floods but legislative 
leaders said they would prefer a salestax boost 
brown said it would take a large increase in the gasoline tax to 
generate the same amount of money that a 1cent sales tax increase 
would provide

a judge today convicted 71 radical 
students in connection with the burning death of seven policemen 
and relatives of the dead troopers and of the defendants scuffled 
in the courtroom 
about 2000 riot policemen were deployed around the district 
criminal court in southern pusan as the convictions and sentences 
were read to the students all from pusans donghui university 
where the troopers were killed 
angry relatives of the dead policemen protested when students 
were not sentenced to death relatives of the students and of the 
troopers pushed and shoved and traded insults after the sentencing 
some defendants left the hearing before sentencing saying they 
didnt care about the penalty they said police commanders were 
responsible for the deaths because they ordered a raid on the 
campus 
as the judge began reading the verdicts students in the gallery 
sang dissident songs and shouted clarify the truth 
of the 71 students one was sentenced to life in prison three 
received 15 years in prison and 31 others received sentences 
ranging from one to 13 years the remaining 36 received suspended 
sentences 
both prosecution and defense lawyers said they would appeal the 
sentences people convicted of murder in south korea can be 
sentenced to death by hanging but judge kim myungkil said the 
students appeared not to have intended to kill anyone 
seven riot troopers were burned to death at donghui university 
during a campus battle the troopers were trying to rescue five 
police officers held hostage by radical students 
students set fire to a barricade drenched in paint thinner as 
the troopers climbed over it several officers wrapped in flames 
leaped from windows while others were burned to death or choked to 
death by smoke one student was critically injured 
the deaths shocked south koreans and the government ordered a 
crackdown on radical students and dissidents to halt violent 
protests the radicals who want the overthrow of the government 
and removal of us troops from south korea have little support 
among the people because of their violent tactics 
the prosecution had demanded the death penalty for three 
students they said led the violence 
we refuse trial shouted the defendants as they arrived at 
the courtroom when some students defiantly refused to leave the 
buses they were dragged off by prison guards

new polls show support for democrat mayoral 
candidate david dinkins has eroded and one survey put his lead 
over republican rudolph giuliani at only 4 points 
less than two weeks ago a poll showed dinkins leading guiliani 
by 19 points 
political analysts said dinkins apparent loss of support may be 
due to controversy last week about the handling of his finances 
including discrepancies in the stated value of stock he transferred 
to his son the issue rekindled questions about dinkins failure to 
pay taxes from 1969 to 1973 
in a poll of 501 registered voters conducted sunday for the 
daily news and wabctv and released monday 45 percent picked 
dinkins compared with 41 percent for giuliani the surveys margin 
of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points 
less than two weeks earlier a daily newswabctv poll showed 
dinkins with 53 percent to giulianis 34 percent 
the survey indicated that the biggest shift occurred among 
jewish voters who last week favored dinkins by 10 points now 44 
percent of jewish voters supported giuliani and 26 percent 
supported dinkins twentysix percent of jewish voters were 
undecided 
the election is scheduled for nov 7 
asked at a campaign stop to comment dinkins said he had 
anticipated there would be some falloff given the negative 
campaigning of recent time but he said he didnt put much stock 
in the poll 
i dont know that this barometer is an accurate one he 
said noting that polls before the primary showed him and mayor 
edward i koch neckandneck dinkins won the primary easily 
a poll conducted for the weekly new york observer found dinkins 
support at 47 percent compared with 27 percent for giuliani and 25 
percent undecided the gap between the candidates had narrowed to 
20 points from 33 points since the last observer survey 
johnsonsinger inc which separately does polling for the 
dinkins campaign telephoned 500 registered voters friday through 
sunday for the observer the issue with the survey was due out 
wednesday 
the polls were the first since the sept 12 democratic primary 
to show dinkins support at less than 50 percent 
independent pollster lee miringoff head of the marist institute 
of public opinion in poughkeepsie said the decline in support in 
both polls showed that dinkins had been hurt but it remains to be 
seen whether the damage will be lasting 
asked to comment on the polls guiliani said he believed 
dinkins financial problems as well as the revelation that 
dinkins had paid 9500 to convicted kidnapper sonny carson for a 
getoutthevote drive before the primary has brought people to 
his campaign which had been close to running out of money in this 
heavily democratic city

leaders of the prochoice and 
antiabortion factions are predicting that some form of tougher 
abortion controls will be passed in the house 
the house is expected to begin debate on the proposed controls 
this afternoon 
the debate follows setbacks for abortion opponents in florida 
and illinois where legislative committees defeated restrictive 
proposals national prochoice and antiabortion leaders have 
viewed pennsylvania as a key battleground since the us supreme 
courts webster decision in july that gave states more authority to 
regulate abortion issues 
a proposal by rep stephen freind the legislatures leading 
abortion opponent would prohibit abortion after the 24th week of 
pregnancy except under threat of substantial and irreversible 
impairment of bodily function to the mother two doctors would 
have to approve the abortion 
the legislation also would prohibit abortions based on the 
fetus sex require a 24hour waiting period to obtain an abortion 
and require women to inform their husbands if they plan to get an 
abortion 
democratic rep karen ritter of lehigh who leads the prochoice 
caucus in the house said her group needs to sway about 40 members 
to defeat freinds proposal 
if freinds proposal wins house approval prochoice lawmakers 
plan to try to weaken the bill with 20 to 30 amendments on issues 
ranging from restoration of unrestricted medicaid funding to 
removal of the 24week ban 
ms ritter and freind both said they expected some amendments to 
pass but he declined to say which ones might have a chance 
prochoice groups plan to hold a candlelight vigil on the 
capitol steps today during the debate 
the senate is not expected to take up the abortion legislation 
until the week of nov 13 democratic gov robert p casey supports

young and reckless may sound like the name 
of a soap opera but a new study says its the way some 68 million 
americans approach diet and health 
on the other hand the study says 45 million others are 
healthy and wealthy and characterizes other large groups as 
fat and frustrated and even confused and indifferent about 
their health 
the survey done for prevention magazine found that middleaged 
women with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles while 
white male bluecollar workers have the worst health habits 
the report the fit and the fat found a sizable group of 
people who want to be healthy but lack the resources both personal 
and financial many others know what to do to be healthy but lack 
motivation said thomas dybdahl director of the study 
even as the magazine was reporting on americans health habits 
the national research council was issuing new dietary 
recommendations 
the average american adult can get along on as little as 500 
milligrams of salt a day far less than the usual diet contains 
the council said 
the nrcs 10th edition of its recommended dietary allowances 
also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 milligrams of vitamin 
c per day as opposed to 60 milligrams for adult nonsmokers and 
suggests that pregnant women should increase vitamin c to 70 
milligrams a day 
the new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient 
recommendations in nearly 10 years the rdas are a major guide for 
developing nutrition programs and policies 
the prevention magazine study based on a survey of 1250 
randomly selected americans was conducted by louis harris 
associates a survey of that size has a margin of error of about 3 
percentage points 
clearly this report demonstrates the need to deliver health 
information in a method that can be both heard and understood 
added mark bricklin editor of prevention 
the survey categorized americans into the following groups 
the healthy and wealthy are tops in health and nutrition 
behavior members of this group are careful with their diets limit 
fat and make sure they get enough fiber vitamins and minerals 
they get regular medical tests maintain proper weight wear 
seatbelts and exercise 
this is the group most likely to drink alcohol but not to 
excess 
they are about 45 million strong more than half are women and 
the group is largely in middle age members of this group are 
likely to have a college degree high income and professional or 
managerial job 
the safe and satisfied tend to have a healthy lifestyle 
but show little inclination to do better 
they limit the fat salt and sugar in their diet but are below 
average in watching cholesterol this group has the best record for 
exercising and does well at maintaining the proper weight they 
are below average for dental visits sleep less than other groups 
and have high stress levels however 
there are 13 million people in this group divided almost evenly 
between men and women the largest share is over 50 they are 
slightly below average in education and income and many hold 
unskilled jobs 
the sedentary but striving are overweight but want to do 
better 
they have good records for avoiding salt fat and cholesterol 
but still have serious weight problems with 77 percent of the 
group overweight they know it and about half are trying to lose 
weight they exercise little however this group does get medical 
checkups drinks little and has good records for home and auto 
safety 
nearly twothirds of the 145 million in this group are women 
they are older than the national average are more likely to be 
minorities and have the lowest income levels 
the young and reckless know what healthful practices are 
but make little effort to follow them 
they pay little heed to nutrition especially fat consumption 
are only average at getting medical care and have a poor record for 
using auto seat belts they do exercise regularly however 
this is a large group 68 million with males being slightly 
more than half they are younger than the national average and have 
slightly higher than average education and income levels 
the fat and frustrated want to be healthy but dont know 
what to do this group has the most members trying to lose weight 
and the fewest who succeed 
in nutritional habits they are about average yet 88 percent are 
overweight their rate for exercising is less than half the 
national average 
this group has the most nondrinkers and has regular medical 
exams but members rarely see a dentist they have high stress 
levels 
the 13 million in this group are mostly women slightly older 
than average more likely to be minorities and have the lowest 
education level of any group 
the confused and indifferent have limited knowledge of what 
constitutes a healthy lifestyle and dont care 
they have the worst dietary habits eating lots of fat and salt 
and sugar rarely have medical checks and 74 percent are 
overweight this group does have more nondrinkers than the 
national average they have a poor record for seatbelt use 
men are the majority in this 9 million member group largely

murals depicting hercules that some 
opponents consider pornographic will remain in the washington 
house at least for now after the house speaker decided to support 
them 
the democratic speaker joe king said recent attacks on 
obscene art by us sen jesse helms rnc helped change his 
mind about the black gray and white murals called twelve labors 
of hercules 
king who opposed the pair of murals until earlier this year 
made a motion monday in the house executive rules committee to keep 
them in the house chamber the motion was approved on a vote of 
32 and king said he expected the decision to stand 
helms really recast the way i look at this he said im 
not for regulating free expression by censoring art i think art 
censorship raises really ominous threats and i was no longer 
comfortable allowing the murals to come down 
the murals were put up in the house chamber in 1982 but they 
were shrouded in draperies until july when king ordered them 
uncovered the murals were scheduled to be removed in december 
because some lawmakers complained they were inappropriate and even 
pornographic 
the creator of the murals michael spafford said he was 
shocked and extremely pleased by the turnaround and found 
kings change of heart truly courageous 
the murals which face each other across the top of the house 
chamber portray the mythological figures performance of 12 
labors including the removal of amazon queen hyppolytas girdle 
one opponent of the murals republican state rep mike padden 
said he will continue to fight the art when the legislature 
reconvenes in january 
of the murals he said they appear to be numerous outlines in 
black and white of people in various stages of copulation 
spafford has denied any sexual content 
spafford commissioned by the state to create the murals said 
he hoped he would now be allowed to complete his original plan for 
a set of four

onethird of the nations poor youths lack proper 
immunization against disease said the american academy of 
pediatrics chief in urging that childrens health issues become a 
top national priority 
to address what it considers a national crisis the academy is 
drafting federal legislation that would guarantee access to quality 
health care for all children and pregnant women even the 
uninsured academy president dr donald schiff said monday at the 
organizations 58th annual meeting 
schiff a university of colorado pediatrics professor in denver 
cited other statistics as well to describe what he called a 
national disgrace they include 
one of every three poor children is not immunized by age 2 
against measles rubella german measles or mumps 
one of every 10 children under age 4 has not seen a physician 
within the past year 
the nations infant mortality rate is 22nd among western 
industrial nations and lags behind countries such as singapore 
spain and hong kong 
as many as 16 million people through age 21 are without health 
insurance said dr marvin kolb chairman of the aaps council on 
government affairs 
marian wright edelman founder of the childrens defense fund 
and a nationally known lobbyist for childrens issues agreed that 
the state of childrens health is acute 
we have a child emergency and crisis thats going to bring our 
nation to its knees she said in a keynote address to several 
hundred pediatricians at the sixday meeting that ends thursday 
ms edelmans group a nonprofit advocacy organization based in 
washington dc is working with the academy to fine tune a 12 
billion proposal aimed at guaranteeing access to quality health 
care for all the nations children and pregnant women 
the proposed legislation would provide funds to improve 
employerbased health insurance for covering employees and their 
dependents 
but more importantly for uninsured children and pregnant women 
a parallel system would be created providing private health 
insurance through a stateadministered fund schiff said 
the academy a 37000member group based in elk grove village 
ill is looking for a congressional sponsor and expects the 
measure to be formally introduced early next year schiff said 
ms edelman blamed the crisis in health care for children in 
part on bush administration policies that favor such things as 
bailing out the banking industry and lowering the capital gains tax 
over funding childcare issues 
to remain competitive with other industrialized countries that 
stress health care for children the united states must make a 
similar commitment ms edelman said 
its not only inhumane she said its bad fiscal policy 
not to invest in child care

a gross violation of soviet law and ethics 
he also admitted that the soviet radar station in krasnoyarsk 
violated the ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty the soviets 
said last month that it would be dismantled ending a dispute that 
soured ussoviet arms control talks for years 
shevardnadzes speech was extraordinary in its frankness and 
elevated the supreme soviet to a forum for major policy statements 
without specifically mentioning any east bloc country he said 
moscow would henceforth relate to its warsaw pact allies on the 
basis of sovereign equality the impermissibility of any kind of 
intervention and the recognition that each country has the right to 
absolute freedom of choice 
poland and hungary former oneparty communist states are 
hurtling toward westernstyle democracy and hundreds of thousands 
of people are taking to the streets in east germany to demand a 
similar transformation 
the foreign minister said moscow is prepared to liquidate all 
its overseas bases by the year 2000 and draw back to within its own 
borders 
he did not specify what conditions would be set for such a 
withdrawal but a year ago president mikhail s gorbachev announced 
the start of a pullback that he said would result in a 500000man 
reduction in soviet military forces 
shevardnadze told the lawmakers proudly that already not a 
single soviet soldier is participating nor im sure will 
participate in military actions anywhere in the world 
and he said his government is prepared to head toward the 
dissolution of the militarypolitical blocs in europe in a mutual 
arrangement worked out by nato and the warsaw pact 
he added however that despite recent historic changes in the 
warsaw pact the soviet union considers that all our obligations 
remain in force 
the soviet union previously has made similar offers to disband 
the warsaw pact which was formed in 1955 in response to the 
creation of nato if the west scraps its military alliance 
shevardnadze denounced the decision by the late president leonid 
i brezhnev to send soviet soldiers into afghanistan in december 
1979 to help the marxist government there fight the anticommunist 
guerrillas 
he disavowed any connection with the decision to intervene and 
said it involved gross violations of our own laws intraparty 
and civil norms and ethics 
a decision that had very serious consequences for our country 
was made behind the back of the party and the people 
shevardnadze said in the speech the full text of which was carried 
by the official tass news agency at the time both he and 
gorbachev were nonvoting members of the communist partys ruling 
politburo 
it was not the first time highly placed soviets have disclosed 
that the decision to intervene in afghanistan was made by a small 
circle around brezhnev but it had not previously been 
characterized by a government spokesman as an outright violation of 
law 
the last soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan in february 
shevardnadze said it took gorbachevs government four years to 
determine that the location of the krasnoyarsk radar station in 
siberia violated the 1972 abm treaty as claimed repeatedly by the 
united states 
he said that as the soviet union tried to move forward on arms 
treaties based on the pact there stood the station the size of 
an egyptian pyramid representing to put it bluntly a violation 
of the abm treaty 
shevardnadze said the station will be dismantled but added 
we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons longrange nuclear 
missiles and were gaining the legal and moral right to demand 
clarity on the question of american installations in greenland and 
england which were modernized as we understand in violation of 
the treaty 
the united states has claimed the treaty does not apply to its 
modernization of the stations in thule greenland and fylingdales 
moor england because they were in place before the abm accord was 
signed 
in washington a bush administration called shevardnadzes 
admission encouraging it builds a degree of confidence it 
builds a degree of trust shevardnadze and secretary of state 
james a baker iii met last month in jackson hole wyo and issued 
a joint statement saying moscow has decided to completely dismantle 
the krasnoyarsk station 
the kremlin had previously offered to turn the station over to a 
civilian agency and partially dismantle it but stopped short of 
acknowledging it violated provisions of the abm treaty 
the united states rejected any plan short of complete 
dismantling of the station saying the abm treaty prohibited the 
deployment of large radar facilities capable of giving early 
warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of 
us or soviet territory 
the krasnoyarsk station is several hundred miles north of the 
chinese border

a defense lawyer in the 2yearold mcmartin 
preschool child molestation trial claims medical evidence that 
children were sexually abused by school personnel may have been 
fabricated 
attorney danny davis made the claim monday the fourth day of 
his closing arguments as he urged jurors to acquit raymond buckey 
31 and his 62yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
he accused prosecution medical experts of trying to find 
molestation when they could 
davis was expected to conclude his statement today prosecutors 
then have 3 days to rebut defense arguments 
the buckeys face 64 counts of molestation and one count of 
conspiracy alleging that 11 children were molested at the 
nowclosed mcmartin preschool they ran in manhattan beach 
they were among seven people arrested in 1983 when prosecutors 
contended scores of youngsters had been victimized charges against 
the other five were later dropped on grounds of insufficient 
evidence although all had been bound over for trial after a 
lengthy preliminary hearing 
the trial has cost taxpayers an estimated 15 million making it 
the nations most expensive and lengthy criminal proceeding 
because of illness and other problems the original panel of 12 
jurors and six alternates has dwindled to 12 the minimum required 
by law superior court judge william pounders has expressed concern 
that loss of another juror would cause a mistrial if the case isnt 
concluded soon

young christian followers of gen michel 
aoun today burned tires and demonstrated in lebanons christian 
enclave against parliaments peace plan that shifts political power 
to the moslem majority 
however the rightwing phalange party the main christian 
political organization in lebanon declared support for the peace 
plan worked out by lebanese legislators during three weeks of 
discussions in taif saudi arabia 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia did not reject 
the plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil war saying it had 
positive points 
aoun had ordered his 20000 troops on alert after he rejected 
the peace plan because it does not include a clear timetable for 
the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from lebanon 
salim hoss head of the rival moslem government also must 
approve the plan he made no immediate comment but senior aides 
said on condition of anonymity that he supports the taif accords 
smoke billowed from the burning tires as schools banks 
government offices and other businesses closed abiding by a strike 
call by aouns christian cabinet 
about 10000 youths mainly students demonstrated in christian 
east beirut 
we sacrifice our blood for the general the demonstrators 
chanted as many of them waved huge posters of the 54yearold 
maronite catholic soldier 
yes yes to the general no no to taif the demonstrators 
said as they headed to aouns headquarters at the bombravaged 
presidential palace in suburban baabda east of beirut 
addressing the demonstrators aoun said the accords wording of 
a syrian withdrawal is very vague from now until eternity 
moslems have argued that the syrian presence was their only 
guarantee that political reforms would occur 
we dont want to give away our beloved land aoun said in 
his 15minute address he has said the lebanese people should vote 
on the accord and offered to step down if they support the 
parliamentary plan 
the phalange party in a statement published by the daily paper 
assafir and other newspapers called for a unified christian 
stand to pursue implementation of the taif plan 
phalangist leader george saadeh who also heads the lebanese 
front alliance of rightwing christian forces was one of the 
legislators who worked out the peace plan 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia in the civil 
war said it was holding contacts with aoun and other christian 
leaders to formulate a unified christian stand on the taif 
accord 
when lebanon received independence in 1943 the majority 
christians were given a 6to5 advantage over moslems in all 
government posts moslems now make up more than 50 percent of the 
nations population 
lebanons prosyrian moslem and leftist militias have expressed 
dissatisfaction with the peace plan mainly for not giving them as 
much power in running the nations affairs as they had requested 
the progressive socialist party of druse warlord walid jumblatt 
and the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia called meetings to 
formulate their stands on the accord 
jumblatt syrias main ally in lebanon said monday he was not 
happy with the accord but would accept it upon syrias request 
amal headed by nabih berri also rejected the plan because it 
did not provide greater representation in parliament for the 12 
million shiites lebanons largest single sect 
under the plan the 99seat chamber will be expanded to 108 
equally divided between moslems and christians amal had demanded 
the number be increased to 128 and hoped to get most of the 
additional seats 
at least 930 people were killed and 2744 wounded in six months 
of fierce artillery duels between aouns forces and syrian gunners 
until an arab leaguesponsored ceasefire took hold sept 22 
the latest outbreak began in march after aoun blockaded illegal 
militiarun ports and the moslemsyrian alliance responded by 
shelling the christian enclave

the san francisco bay areas 3 million 
commuters must cooperate until christmas with officials urging them 
to use car pools or ride buses trains or ferries to avoid 
gridlock mayor art agnos says 
so far it has been very smooth said agnos who boarded an 
fbi helicopter to get an aerial view of commuter traffic monday 
evening there is congestion but not anything that created 
gridlock 
despite foul weather commuters got through without crippling 
problems on the first full workday since the earthquake the 
california highway patrol reported more traffic congestion but 
fewer accidents than normal 
and early today skies were clear and traffic on freeways and 
bridges moving well transit officials said prompting a fear that 
the good news may invite a return to normal driving patterns later 
in the week 
we are concerned we can only wait and see what happens if 
every one went back to their normal routine we would have the 
gridlock everyone is talking about sgt lisa homen of the golden 
gate transportation district which manages the famous bridge said 
today 
the bay area rapid transit system set a singleday record 
monday with 261901 passengers 39 percent more than on the 
previous monday and a record for a single day 
agnos said some drivers were traveling alone something 
metropolitan transportation chairman rod diridon termed an 
antisocial act 
but the mayor said many others have obviously made a decision 
to follow the advice to use alternative transportation while road 
and bridge repairs are made 
its just a continuation of the extraordinary cooperation and 
fantastic attitude of area residents said agnos adding that 
people have refrained from looting and strangers are helping one 
another 
the spirit and character of our city has never been brighter 
than it is is today he said if people will maintain this 
commitment were going to be in great shape 
agnos also said several thousand commuters took advantage of the 
quick addition of 14 ferries rough water on the bay made some 
passengers seasick but agnos added the galelike weather was 
unusual and the ride wouldnt be that rough all the time 
one ferry was turned back monday because of rough waters 
authorities said the union ferry building the terminus of many 
ferries bound for san francisco was closed for an hour because of 
high waves and the boats were diverted to a pier about a mile away 
on a 6 am ferry from oakland to san francisco what should 
have been a 30minute crossing took 55 minutes through heavy swells 
that occasionally washed over the deck of the boat 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through it said passenger john trowbridge 27 of alameda 
it can only get better this cant get much worse 
everybodys just going to have to go into slow motion that 
includes all the bosses said karen meyer 42 of oakland 
the fleet of ferries was called into service to help make up for 
the collapse of a section of the 85mile doubledeck san 
franciscooakland bay bridge a 50foot section of the upper deck 
fell like a trap door onto the lower deck during the quake 
knocking the bridge out of commission for at least four weeks 
without the 10lane bridge 65000 rushhour motorists had to 
find other ways to and from work about 260000 cars use the bridge 
daily 
extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional 
45000 riders other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic 
that normally crosses the bridge 
on the oakland side of the bay bridge a 1 mile section of 
interstate 880 collapsed 
other freeways also are devastated including the embarcadero 
freeway along the waterfront in san francisco and a fivemile 
stretch of interstate 280 in san francisco was closed

exxon corp has sued the state of 
alaska charging that cleanup of the nations worst oil spill was 
hindered because the state opposed the use of oildispersing 
chemicals 
a state official said exxon was trying to rewrite history and 
that the state had approved the use of chemicals before the spill 
exxon said it will seek reimbursement from the state for cleanup 
costs and damage claims that the company believes were worsened by 
the states conduct no amounts were specified 
the case filed monday in anchorage superior court is a 
counterclaim to a lawsuit the state filed in august against exxon 
and alyeska pipeline service co the industry consortium that 
operates the transalaska oil pipeline and the valdez oil terminal 
the states lawsuit alleges that negligence was involved in the 
march 24 wreck of the exxon valdez and the subsequent oil cleanup 
and that the oil industry misrepresented its ability to deal with a 
major spill in prince william sound which leads from valdez to the 
open sea 
exxons counterclaim says immediate use of chemicals to break 
oil into droplets was a key part of a spill contingency plan 
approved by the state 
nevertheless the suit alleges the state persistently opposed 
the use of chemical dispersants after the exxon valdez ran aground 
and ripped its hull open spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil 
dennis kelso the state commissioner of environmental 
conservation said monday that he had not examined the lawsuit but 
that it appeared to be an effort to mislead the public about what 
he contends was a lack of oil industry preparedness for a major 
spill 
the state did not oppose the use of dispersants in the area 
described by exxon kelso said he said the industry hadnt 
stockpiled enough dispersants in southcentral alaska to do any 
good 
exxon wasnt prepared to use dispersants and now theyre 
trying to rewrite the history of the spill and make it appear that 
someone else was the problem kelso said 
before the spill state and federal regulators agreed that at 
the discretion of the coast guard dispersants could be used in the 
central part of prince william sound without further state 
consultation exxon said 
kelso said the state did not renege on that agreement 
the coast guard authorized use of the chemicals on the evening 
of march 26 but by that time it was too dark to work exxon said 
during the night a storm blew much of the oil out of the targeted 
zone the company said

czechoslovakian premier ladislav adamec 
today accused austrian media of directing antigovernment 
demonstrations in his country and said a prodemocracy protest 
planned for saturday probably will be banned 
adamec said the communist government in prague seen in the west 
as one of eastern europes hardliners is open to criticism 
but we expect honest treatment he told reporters after 
arriving on a twoday visit we notice an absence of objectivity 
in some of the reporting on czechoslovakia 
in an interview with austrian reporters before his visit adamec 
accused austrias government television of helping to organize 
banned demonstrations in prague 
asked by an austrian television reporter to explain the comment 
adamec said i didnt say that exactly but its true that at a 
series of demonstrations directives have come from various media 
in vienna 
over the past year austrian and west german television crews 
have been beaten by riot police dispersing banned protests in an 
apparent effort to curb their coverage their broadcasts can be 
received in several parts of czechoslovakia 
charter 77 and other independent groups have announced plans for 
a peaceful demonstration saturday to mark the 71st anniversary of 
czechoslovak independence 
adamec said he did not know whether the demonstration would be 
permitted but added i doubt we would have reasons to approve 
it 
last year 5000 people who took part in a peaceful rally on the 
oct 28 anniversary were dispersed by riot police using batons 
dogs water cannon and tear gas 
the communist party daily rude pravo in prague has already 
warned that any protesters this year could face prosecution 
czechoslovakias relations with austria fraught with tension 
from the past centuries of hapsburg domination of bohemia are 
complicated today by austrian criticism of czechoslovakias human 
rights record 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky indicated after initial 
talks with adamec that vienna hoped to focus on improving economic 
and cultural ties during the current visit the two men are also to 
sign an agreement designed to address austrian concern over the 
safety of czechoslovak nuclear reactors

a real estate firm that set a city record 
last year by selling a mansion for 41 million is trying to beat 
its own mark with an asking price of 59 million for a villa along 
millionaires row 
right now the market is pretty good at the high end said 
spencer potter a broker for the bostonbased firm landvest 
outside of boston we just sold a place for 25 million the 
afternoon it went on the market of course thats not typical but 
it only takes one buyer to make a market at this level he said 
the firm is trying to sell fairholme a tudorstyle villa next 
to railroad magnate cornelius vanderbilts former summer 
cottage the breakers 
fairholme was once owned by the sister of artist georgia 
okeeffe and former president kennedy visited occasionally to swim 
in the heated pool when his back gave him trouble potter said the 
mansion is now owned by john and chandler maschek jr of palm 
beach fla 
the buyer will probably be someone selfmade with new money 
who wants to make a statement potter said 
last year landvest set a city record by selling clarendon 
court which is where socialite martha sunny von bulow slipped 
into a coma that her husband claus was later acquitted of causing 
the two mansions are within a few blocks of each other along a 
milelong stretch of newport known as millionaires row

hailed the birth of what was black africas wealthiest nation 
while it was a public holiday and bunting draped some streets of 
lusaka the capital there were no signs of open celebrations 
president kenneth kaunda who led the whiteruled british colony 
of northern rhodesia to independence as blackgoverned zambia on 
oct 24 1964 four months ago called for a lowkey silver jubilee 
to save his impoverished nation money 
instead kaunda watched sporting events tribal drummers and 
dancers and gymnastics at independence stadium here 
kaunda canceled lavish celebrations in june as part of a package 
of international monetary fundproposed economic reforms to salvage 
his countrys crippled economy 
kaunda at the time was forced to abandon a moderate homegrown 
program and adopt more radical and unpopular measures including a 
devaluation of the kwacha currency lifting of statefixed price 
controls and sharp increases in the cost of staple corn 
all this meant severe belttightening for the nations 7 million 
people whose living standards have plunged since they were 
regarded the most prosperous black africans at independence 
since the mid1970s world prices of copper which account for 90 
percent of all export income have plunged spending on social

but on monday night in a nationwide television address kaunda 
spoke optimistically about the future of his nation 
i see a bright future for zambia he said we have taken 
very tough economic decisions but there is no doubt in my mind 
that these measures will yield results sooner rather than later

nato defense chiefs today discussed 
the western alliances nuclear needs in an era of reduced eastwest 
tensions 
defense secretary dick cheney and other ministers of the north 
atlantic treaty organization began a twoday strategy session at 
the quinta do lago resort on portugals southern coast 
a dutch official said cheney and his aides described the us 
nuclear modernization effort as more in reaction to what the 
soviet union is doing at this moment that despite an easing of 
tensions the soviets were building up some longrange nuclear 
systems 
the dutch official speaking on condition of anonymity quoted 
the americans as saying soviet reform has shown up in the field of 
nonnuclear weapons but not on the strategic nuclear side 
natos secretarygeneral manfred woerner opened the meeting by 
talking about the good perspective on eastwest arms controls 
talks in geneva and vienna according to this account but he 
cautioned that nato governments should not reduce their military 
budgets without any concrete results 
the defense chiefs did not discuss a candid speech given a day 
earlier by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in which 
he said a disputed soviet radar station violated the ussoviet 
antiballistic missile treaty and would be dismantled 
he also told the soviet legislature the kremlin was willing to 
negotiate the disbanding of the nato and sovietled military 
alliances in europe 
there was no immediate reaction to shevardnadzes remarks but 
his speech was certain to be analyzed at least informally by 
officials attending the meeting here 
in advance of the talks nato officials said the ministers would 
not make any key decisions on their nuclear forces 
the nuclear affairs of the alliance are running along very 
smoothly at this time said a senior nato official who demanded 
anonymity 
even so the ministers were considered likely to give their 
aides the goahead for a detailed examination of the alliances 
nuclear role at a time of enormous changes in the soviet union and 
eastern europe

the phillips petroleum co plant hit by 
an enormous explosion and fire is the largest of its kind in the 
nation and a lengthy shutdown could affect prices in the world 
plastics industry analysts say 
phillips 800acre pasadena plant complex turns out more than 2 
billion pounds of plastics per year threequarters of it 
polyethylene phillips supplies up to 19 percent of the worlds raw 
polyethylene and if its unit making that plastic is destroyed or 
shut down for a while after mondays explosion manufacturers could 
be affected 
if the whole thing goes down there are going to be shortages 
all over the place analyst bill kuhlke of dewitt amp co a 
houstonbased chemical consulting firm told the houston chronicle 
but dave dryden a spokesman at phillips bartlesville okla 
headquarters said today its hard to say what the effect might 
be on the industry were very early in the assessment of 
damages 
there are thousands of different plastics dryden said 
about a third of the worlds plastics are made by phillips or its 
contractors 
polyethylene is made from ethylene a gas derived from natural 
gas ethylene for the pasadena plant comes by pipeline from a 
phillips plant in sweeny phillips is spending 300 million to add 
15 billion pounds per year of ethylene production at sweeney 
the polyethylene plant was to have increased production 15 
percent in 1990 
the highdensity polyethylene comes out as milky bbsized 
pellets that manufacturers shape into anything from motor oil 
bottles milk jugs plastic bottle caps to industrial pipe and 
shopping bags 
phillips also makes 500 million pounds annually of polypropylene 
at the plant using propylene gas as the base that plastics uses 
include carpet fiber and films 
some industry observers said the effect of the plants shutdown 
will be tempered by a recent loosening of the plastics markets 
neither polyethylene nor polypropylene is nearly as tight as 
it was a year ago said greg derrick phillips coordinator for 
financial communications in bartlesville 
consultant earl simpson with bonner amp moore associates said the 
phillips explosion should allow a polyethylene price increase of 
about 3 cents per pound stock on hand will only last about five 
weeks he said

a kentucky lottery betting game on 
professional football was discarded before it began when gov 
wallace wilkinson declared it a bad idea in the face of 
opposition from the horse racing industry 
the supersports game was scheduled to begin last week but a 
flurry of court activity on a lawsuit filed by horse racing groups 
delayed its kickoff 
on monday the kentucky supreme court lifted an injunction that 
delayed the game which involves parimutuel betting on national 
football league games 
several hours later wilkinson announced he wanted the game 
discarded 
the lottery i think is being harmed by the controversy 
surrounding the supersports game wilkinson told reporters the 
fun of the online lottery game has all been lost in the media 
attention given the supersports game 
kentucky voters approved a state lottery earlier this year in a 
referendum oregon was the first state to introduce a lottery game 
based on nfl betting but no court action was filed there and the 
game is under way 
kentucky lottery corp president frank keener and board chairman 
william sullivan said in a joint statement they disagreed with 
wilkinsons decision but would comply and discard the game 
the kentucky thoroughbred association kentucky harness 
horsemens association and the horsemens benevolent and protective 
association contended the nfl game would steal patrons from 
kentucky racetracks the only places where parimutuel betting is 
legal in the state 
the horse racing industry groups also said parimutuel betting on 
nfl games was not envisioned by voters who approved the state 
lottery or by the legislature which approved legislation to set 
up the lottery 
listening to people across this commonwealth i think they are 
telling me this is a bad idea said wilkinson who previously had 
told lottery officials he would support the supersports game

president bush told some of the nations best 
math and science teachers today that they have demonstrated not 
only that excellence is possible in american education but that it 
should be the norm 
bush addressing the 112 winners of the presidential award for 
excellence in mathematics and science teaching lamented that 
americas schools do not produce more top performers in these 
subjects 
youve seen all the surveys about american students poor 
performance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers around 
the world weve all seen it we agonize over them he said 
youre not just complaining about it you are doing something 
about it youre showing that excellence is not just possible in 
american education but that it ought to be the norm the 
president said 
bush lauded the victory of a high school student from denver in 
this years 20th internal physics olympiad in warsaw 
when the united states began competing in the tournament in 
1986 some thought that our students wouldnt really have a chance 
against students from europe and the far east but our teams have 
consistently distinguished themselves capped by this gold medal 
performance he said 
this is the standard of excellence that americas students and 
teachers should aspire to and that more can attain the 
president said our problem is not that we dont have american 
students excelling in science and math we just dont see enough of 
them 
bush apologized to the teachers for being a little bit late 
for the ceremony held in brilliant autumn sunshine in the white 
house rose garden 
nodding in the direction of the oval office he said i was 
sitting in there trying to solve a few quadratic equations 
somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget i might say 
he drew more laughter with a call for a moment of silence in 
memory of those substitute teachers back home 
the award program begun in 1983 is administered by the 
national science foundation the winners were named earlier this 
year two from each state and us territories as well as four from 
the defense departments schools abroad 
the teachers were headed to capitol hill later in the day to 
present their ideas for improving education to the house 
subcommittee on science research and technology

defense attorneys for five americans 
accused of conspiring with carlos lehder today called the colombian 
drug lord a bad dude but denied he had anything to do with the 
defendants 
attorneys ended their final arguments and rebuttal this morning 
in the socalled son of lehder trial after raymond david who 
represents donald lady 41 of pomona calif charged the 
prosecution was grasping at straws 
carlos lehder is a drug baron and bad dude but i dont know 
what he has to do with the people sitting over there at the 
defense table david said 
defense attorneys presented arguments monday and today on behalf 
of their clients the accused were not part of the conspiracy that 
the government alleges ran from 1974 to 1989 had withdrawn from 
the conspiracy committed crimes outside the statute of limitations 
or were innocent 
after the defense finished presenting its closing arguments 
today the judge was expected to instruct the jury so it could 
begin deliberations 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller told the jury the 
evidence shows only one thing that they are guilty as charged 
frederick mycock who represents lawyer barry kane 52 of 
hyannis mass told the jury monday that the government had failed 
to prove with any credible witnesses that kane was guilty 
if kane had flown cocaine as alleged in 1977 he withdrew from 
the conspiracy making the government unable to prosecute him 
because of the 5year statute of limitations and mycock said 
there was not one allencompassing conspiracy as alleged by the 
government but several conspiracies 
mueller tied each defendant to lehder and his organization in 
their roles as pilots of cocaine flights and distributors of the 
drug 
there was a common thread of importation and distribution 
mueller said 
lehder 40 was convicted last year and sentenced to life in 
prison without possibility of parole for running a massive 
smuggling operation the case grew out of an investigation that 
followed lehders trial 
defense attorney patrick hallinan who represents thomas 
herington 35 of mill valley calif claimed the government 
reached down into the slime for witnesses 
we dont have one solid piece of evidence except out of the 
mouths of felons liars and perjurers said hallinan 
kevin sanders who represents sam stewart of anaheim calif 
called his client a hero a family man and a lawabiding citizen 
who was the victim of a government witch hunt 
herington faces one count of conspiracy to distribute five 
kilograms or more of cocaine kane stewart and donald lady 41 of 
pomona calif are accused of the conspiracy distribution count 
and an additional charge of conspiracy to import cocaine 
jack carlton reed 59 is charged with operating a continuing 
criminal enterprise and conspiracy to distribute 
if convicted the men face possible sentences of 10 years to 
life

poor neighborhoods one person was killed and 11 were wounded and 
13 structures burned down only days before the area was host of the 
super bowl 
potential jurors passed two small groups of demonstrators on the 
courthouse steps monday black protesters carried signs with such

armored personnnel carriers to prepare for it black said we 
cant prevent a riot but we can ensure jurors are not worried

medical science has the means to reduce the 
annual number of infant deaths by 10000 in this country a top 
government health official said today 
we must remove the barriers to early prenatal care dr 
james mason acting surgeon general and assistant secretary for 
health in the department of health and human services told the 
house select committee on children youth and families 
there must be an outreach for those people who are unlikely to 
come in by themselves mason told the committee which is 
examining this countrys ranking of 22nd among industrialized 
nations in infant mortality 
the bush administration has proposed an expansion of medicaid 
eligibility for expectant mothers he said and a white house 
commission on infant mortality is planning to introduce other 
proposals in about two months 
lawmakers are looking at such solutions for the problem as more 
efforts to consolidate social programs that deal with pregnant 
women a streamlined application system for various social 
programs and an aggressive outreach program though schools 
clinics and welfare agencies to get to women earlier 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the panel questioned 
the administrations sense of urgency if it knows that 10000 
infants could be saved yearly he said there is an identifiable 
population of highrisk pregnant women on the rolls of the women 
infants and children nutrition program 
mason said nearly 40000 of the 4 million americans born this 
year will not live past their first birthday an additional 400000 
will live but will be born with or develop chronic problems due to 
inadequate care before birth 
expectant mothers who must rely on governmentfunded health 
centers rarely get the uniform care private patients receive 
according to a report by the committees minority staff released on 
the eve of todays hearing 
it said only 18 percent of the governmentfunded agencies offer 
necessary prenatal services in the same facility of the 91 sites 
surveyed in 10 states only 38 percent reported offering prenatal 
care 
as a result the care that a private patient may receive from 
one clinic or physician pregnancy testing family planning 
consultation nutrition counseling delivery and postpartum care 
is scattered for poor women the study said 
the study is part of an effort by the committee to explore the 
rise during the 1980s in infant mortality and infants with low 
birth weight the figures had fallen in the two previous decades 
we are needlessly wasting hundreds of thousands of lives and 
millions of dollars a year because of our failure to provide 
adequate prenatal care to pregnant women said miller dcalif 
chairman of the select committee 
miller said that in 1987 the low birth weight rate in the 
united states rose to 69 percent the highest level since 1979 
each year 300000 babies die or are born with low birth weight 
and the us public health service ranks the united states last 
among 22 developed nations in infant mortality rates miller said 
he said the committee wants to learn about barriers to adequate 
care and social problems that have compounded the crisis among 
those are aids drug abuse and the transmission of syphilis to 
children because of increased trading of sex for drugs 
a key issue is the growing number of teenage mothers who 
according to government figures have a disproportionate share of 
babies with low birth weight and infant deaths only 53 percent of 
teenagers receive care in the first three months of pregnancy the 
government reported 
the centers surveyed were in alabama arkansas california 
colorado iowa maine new york ohio virginia and washington

when the authorities at salisbury 
cathedral began planning new restrooms they sought advice from the 
royal fine art commission they got an earful 
what the bishop of salisbury calls providing a few muchneeded 
loos has been denounced as a major act of vandalism by the 
commissions chairman lord st john of fawsley 
lord st john even arose in the house of lords to lash the men 
who run britains cathedrals declaring deans are dangerous 
i think the whole thing could have been dealt with in an 
entirely different and more discreet way said salisburys dean 
the very rev hugh dickinson 
the anglican cathedral has found its restrooms inadequate to 
cope with half a million visitors a year who come to gaze at the 
404foot spire the wealth of sculpture and an original copy of 
magna carta 
the new restrooms tentatively were planned in a hidden nook at 
the rear of the cathedral with a door opening off the medieval 
cloister visitors couldnt see it from outside without trespassing 
onto the grounds of the cathedral school 
however the restrooms would be a new bump on the cathedrals 
ground plan which has not changed since the foundations were laid 
in 1220 
any construction here would compromise the clarity of the 
cathedral plan and was therefore wrong in principle the royal 
fine art commission said in its annual report in july 
perhaps an aesthetically sensitive peregrine falcon flying 
overhead would be troubled at an alteration but otherwise no one 
would see it dickinson said last month 
his further thoughts on the dispute appeared in the salisbury 
cathedral news under the title nostalgia sickness of the 
spirit 
lord st john provoked by the bishops support of the dean 
announced in a letter to the daily telegraph last week that the 
proposed site of the restroom was among the most breathtakingly 
beautiful spaces in the whole ecclesiastical world 
despite tourist herds and present controversy salisbury is 
recognizably the same cathedral that john constable painted from 
the water meadows still the serene community that inspired anthony 
trollopes barchester novels 
who could be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet 
close of hereford trollope wrote in the warden 
who could lie basking in the cloisters of salisbury and gaze 
on that unequalled spire without feeling that bishops should 
sometimes be rich 
trollope wrote in the 19th century when the cathedrals were 
agitated by demands for reform of abuses including clergymen 
enriching themselves by holding multiple offices 
today stripped of their wealth the great churches are caught 
up in costly concerns of preserving the national heritage 
salisbury is seeking 104 million to repair its spire 
herefords dean recently provoked a bitter controversy by proposing 
to sell a medieval map of the world to finance repairs costing 
112 million 
hereford is off the beaten path in western england and draws far 
fewer visitors than does salisbury which has the additional lure 
of nearby stonehenge 
controversies about alterations to the cathedral are nothing new 
at salisbury which in the 18th century suffered the attention of 
james wyatt the destroyer who moved tombs knocked down a 
stone screen and is said to have removed most of the glass 
there is nothing which we are proposing to do or would want 
to do to the building which could be anything conceivably on the 
scale or effect of anything wyatt did dickinson said 
the only proposals which we have tentatively proposed were 
things which we regarded as being so discreet that had they been 
done here 10 years ago nobody would have noticed at all

newly elected east german president egon krenz 
today sternly warned against further prodemocracy demonstrations 
and communist authorities for the first time admitted that police 
had attacked peaceful activists 
further protests were expected late today in east berlin a day 
after more than 300000 people marched through the streets of 
leipzig demanding greater freedom it was the largest street 
protest in the nations 40year history 
parliament elected krenz as president and he promised to 
investigate charges of police brutality against prodemocracy 
demonstrators earlier this month krenz was in charge of police 
forces at the time 
krenz a 52yearold career politician last week was named the 
new communist party chief east germanys supreme leadership post 
krenz urged an end to further demonstrations 
demonstrations however peacefully they may be planned and 
thought out carry within themselves the danger of ending in a 
different way from how they started krenz told the peoples 
chamber after his election 
our society which has so many new things to tackle is thus 
put under increasing tension he said calling on east germans to 
refrain from demonstrations to avoid a worsening of situation or 
confrontation 
the official east german news agency adn said parliament elected 
krenz who took over as party chief late wednesday with a large 
majority of the votes in the 500member chamber 
but for the first time during an election of an east german 
president there were votes against the single candidate 
twentysix members of the peoples chamber voted against krenz and 
another 26 abstained according to parliament speaker horst 
sindermann 
parliament is under the tight control of the communist party 
and krenzs election as president was assured after his nomination 
by the 21member ruling politburo the peoples chamber also 
elected krenz to be the head of the nations armed forces with 
eight votes against and 17 abstentions adn said 
east german officials today admitted for the first time that 
police had attacked peaceful prodemocracy protesters earlier this 
month 
there were instances where security officials exceeded their 
authority and illegal acts were committed against some of those 
detained the government said in a statement released by adn 
the report was prepared by the national defense and justice 
affairs committees in parliament adn said 
adn said the government later decided to use restraint during 
mass demonstrations unless there is violence or the threat of 
violence and that use of firearms to quell demonstrators had 
been prohibited 
police officials have apologized to victims of verifiable police 
brutality adn said the news agency said 83 complaints of police 
brutality are under initial review and four cases have been taken 
up by prosecuters 
mondays peaceful twohour protest in leipzig and an 
announcement from several hundred factory workers that they formed 
the countrys first independent labor union were considered tests 
of krenzs professed desire to embrace reform 
in leipzig demonstrators carried banners and placards critical 
of the new leadership and the oneparty system that brought krenz 
to power last week after the ouster of his mentor 77yearold 
erich honecker 
there were smaller demonstrations in east berlin and in 
northwestern schwerin 
adn reported the leipzig demonstration and other public rallies 
on monday but denied a free trade union had been formed in east 
berlin 
several hundred workers at the suburban wilhelm pieck 
electronics factory said in a statement released in west berlin 
monday that they formed an independent labor organization called 
reform 
the reform group wants the right to strike to set wages for 
workers and prices for products 
west germanys zdf television network reported that whole 
sections of the factory had already resigned from the staterun 
labor federation 
an appeal to spread the reform union movement was sent to other 
factories in east germany the network reported 
reform spokesman roelf boerger said in the statement issued in 
west berlin that the existing staterun trade union represents the 
communist partys interests and doesnt enjoy the confidence of 
the workers 
adn quoted pieck factory chief wolfgang wernicke as saying 
there was never a meeting to create a socalled independent trade 
union at our factory 
the news agency also quoted wernicke as saying that one 
factory worker was responsible for the reform statement issued on 
monday 
this former trade union member did not succeed with his goal 
to create an independent union adn quoted wernicke as saying 
adns denial of the incident may signal the limit of the new 
leaderships tolerance of dissent and its fear of a force such as 
polands solidarity which could rally east germanys 86 million 
workers 
supporters of solidarity born nine years ago during nationwide 
strikes now lead polands noncommunist government 
under krenz mass demonstrations are being allowed to proceed 
eacefully in east germany and the staterun media have engaged in 
unprecedented debate on the state of the country but the ruling 
communists have made it clear they have no intention of sharing 
power with the opposition 
opposition groups such as new forum remain unrecognized by the 
government and officials have declined to discuss reforms with 
members of the unofficial organizations 
protesters began taking to the streets in large numbers in early 
october as east germany celebrated 40 years as a communist state 
amid an exodus of tens of thousands of skilled young people to the 
west 
at first police brutally beat and arrested hundreds of 
protesters 
officials in austria said today 530 east germans crossed the 
border from hungary en route to west germany since monday border 
guards said the crossings brought to 44367 the number of east 
germans who have fled since hungary opened its border for the east 
germans sept 11

several denverarea residents who survived the 
crash of united airlines flight 232 in sioux city iowa in july 
are organizing a support group to help one another cope with 
lingering emotional trauma 
for me talking to other survivors is probably the most 
valuable thing as far as therapy said jerry schemmel 
you can talk to counselors your wife your family but when 
you sit down in front of another person who went through the same 
thing you did you know that person relates exactly to what youre 
talking about 
schemmel 29 is one of 184 people who survived the crash of 
flight 232 on july 19 the airplane cartwheeled and crashed just 
short of an airport landing strip en route from denver to chicago 
killing 112 people 
the victims included schemmels colleague and friend jay 
ramsdell 25 commissioner of the denverbased continental 
basketball association ramsdell was seated about 10 rows behind 
schemmel 
i had one week that was particularly tough for me said 
schemmel who now serves as acting cba commissioner it was 
described by a therapist as posttraumatic depression then i got a 
call from another survivor garry priest and the discussion just 
completely picked me up 
being able to relate to the others opens things up for me you 
tell the survivors things you wouldnt even tell a therapist 
kate wolfe bressieux 35 another survivor said she hopes the 
support group will help normalize what were going through 
there are very few people who have survived a plane crash and 
nobody can really understand it unless theyve shared that 
experience i hope the support group will facilitate the healing 
process she said

prosecutor sean hoar said the 19yearold cooperated with 
authorities and never was charged 
defense attorney richard urrutia blamed his clients plight on 
the media 
all their actions were undertaken innocently and in good 
faith and it is a tragedy that they now come under a cloud of 
suspicion and have been subject to sensational reporting in the 
press he said we can only hope that this sorry episode does 
not have a chilling effect on future research into areas such as 
human sexuality 
urrutia said the woods never received any money in the 
encounters and that paying a token fee to scientific research 
subjects is customary 
urrutia declined to discuss the origin of the research project 
and said he didnt know why the woods traveled across the country 
to conduct it 
he said the couple pleaded guilty because they wanted to get on 
with their lives

fatalities have increased an estimated 31 
percent on rural interstate highways in states that increased the 
speed limit to 65 miles per hour a new government report says 
but the report by the national highway traffic safety 
administration said not all of the increase can be attributed to 
speed and higher death tolls in some states may be due to chance 
because the number of fatalities is so small 
the agency in a report delivered to congress on monday said 
states are in the best position to make decisions on posted speed 
limits and enforcement 
the available data show that the number of rural interstate 
fatalities and the rural interstate fatality rate increased after 
the speed limit was raised to 65 mph the report said 
it estimated that fatalities on rural highways increased 31 
percent from 1986 before the higher speed limit was allowed to 
1988 in those states that raised the speed limit during 1987 
the agency estimated that onethird of the fatalities were due 
to increased traffic on the highways and twothirds to other 
factors primarily greater speed 
the report is based on highway fatality data provided by the 40 
states that increased the speed limit on rural interstates which 
congress allowed beginning in 1987 
deaths on interstates totaled 2836 in 1988 or about 6 percent 
of total fatalities interstate highways have a lower fatality rate 
per miles traveled than other roads 
overall traffic fatalities increased in 1988 by 15 percent 
over 1987 from 46390 to 47079 the highway safety agency said 
but the fatality rate which considers miles traveled remained 
stable at the 1987 rate of 24 which is the lowest in history the 
report said

orders for big ticket durable goods edged 
down 01 percent in september and would have fallen even further 
except for the second biggest increase in defense orders on record 
the government reported tuesday 
the commerce department said that orders for durable goods 
items expected to last three or more years dropped by 147 million 
last month to a seasonally adjusted 12668 billion following a 39 
percent rise in august 
without a huge 563 percent surge in defense orders the 
weakness in manufacturing would have been even more pronounced 
excluding defense orders would have fallen by 39 percent the 
biggest decline in civilian demand since may 
analysts attributed the big jump in military demand to a rush by 
the pentagon to place orders in september the last month of the 
governments budget year they said the weakness in the civilian 
categories provided fresh evidence that us manufacturing is 
headed into a slowdown 
this is a weak report showing that the industrial sector has 
lost momentum said bruce steinberg an economist at merrill 
lynch the only thing that held orders up in september was 
defense and that category is volatile and not indicative of 
underlying economic trends 
in september manufacturing employment took its biggest nosedive 
in seven years and many economists predicted that the weak orders 
report would lead to more layoffs in coming months 
this report points to a sharp slowdown in industrial activity 
during the final quarter of the year said gordon richards 
senior economist at the national association of manufacturers 
many economists pointed to a big 56 percent drop in demand for 
nondefense capital goods in september as a particularly ominous 
sign especially since it followed an even larger 103 percent 
august decline 
this area which reflects business investment plans has been 
one of the key sources of strength over the past year 
david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw hill said 
that he believed the country would be able to avoid an outright 
recession in the coming year but that the economy had entered a 
period of very sluggish growth with the unemployment rate likely to 
rise from its current 53 percent to perhaps 57 percent by next 
summer 
we are not going to have a recession in part because the 
federal reserve is easing credit conditions but we will have a 
very significant slowdown in the economy wyss said 
in september orders in the transportation category fell by 47 
percent to 3478 billion following a 73 percent august increase 
the september weakness was attributed to a 3 billion decline in 
orders for new cars as manufacturers cut back on production plans 
in the face of sluggish sales 
the weakness in transportation was masked by the huge surge in 
defense orders which totaled 1239 billion last month it was the 
second largest percentage increase on record after a 683 percent 
jump in june 1988 pushed orders to a record monthly level of 138 
billion 
orders in the machinery category that includes computers dropped 
24 percent to 2213 billion while orders for other electrical 
machinery were up 63 percent to 2064 billion 
orders for primary metals such as steel were up 19 percent in 
september to 1149 billion 
shipments of durable goods fell 28 percent to 1248 billion 
following a 96 percent rise in august both the september decrease 
and the august advance in shipments primarily reflected swings in 
the transportation sector 
the 01 percent decrease in total durable goods orders was the 
first decline since a 25 percent drop in july

the white house is looking for legislation on 
which president bush can seek to exercise a lineitem veto as a 
test case presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
such a move vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the 
rest intact would produce a major constitutional confrontation 
with the democratic majority in both the house and the senate 
some legal scholars contend that such powers are implicit in a 
presidents power to veto legislation others argue against such an 
interpretation 
now fitzwater said the administration is willing to force the 
issue and prompt a court case believing the president has such 
powers and should be able to exercise them 
we are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test 
case we havent found one yet fitzwater said 
the theory is to try to do it and see if it worksyou claim 
you have the authority and you just do it fitzwater said 
he said forcing such a test had been considered for some time 
beginning in the reagan administration 
both former president reagan and bush called for a 
constitutional amendment to ensure the president lineitem veto 
powers and it has long been an item on conservative agendas 
however the proposals never made it very far in either 
congressional chamber 
vice president dan quayle told an audience in chicago on monday 
that the president was inclined to do so if he can find an 
appropriate bill in which to veto individual provisions while 
signing the rest into law 
quayle said lineitem veto power would allow the president to 
reduce federal spending 
meanwhile fitzwater said the president will continue to press 
for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet with groups 
of mostly democratic senators this week to lobby for the plan 
which has already passed the house 
fitzwater said the administration has the votes to pass a cut 
if it can have a straight majorityrule vote on the measure in the 
senate

the bush administration today called 
extraordinary admissions by the soviet foreign minister that 
its invasion of afghanistan was illegal and that a radar 
installation violated the antiballistic missile treaty 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater praised soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadzes candor calling it a step in the 
right direction for arms control 
shevardnadze in a speech monday to the supreme soviet 
legislature said the decision under the late soviet leader leonid 
brezhnev to send troops into afghanistan was a gross violation 
of soviet law and ethics 
he said the krasnoyarsk radar station in siberia was a violation 
of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and would be dismantled 
the united states had argued for years that the massive 
installation violated the 1972 abm treaty 
fitzwater said of shevardnadzes admissions theyre 
extraordinary 
its difficult to say what grand meaning they have but it 
certainly seems like a step in the right direction in terms of 
glasnost and an environment for improved progress on arms 
control and any other number of issues he said 
fitzwater who was also former president reagans white house 
press secretary said that as the spokesman who stood here for 
any number of years talking about the abm treaty violation of the 
krasnoyarsk radar and talking about the occupation of afghanistan 
the acknowledgements yesterday by the foreign minister are fairly

government agents in at least two dozen countries 
illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988 amnesty 
international said wednesday 
also 1903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in 
35 countries last year the highest number of such executions since 
1981 the londonbased organization said in its annual global 
survey of human rights abuses 
it cited alleged violations in 133 countries ranging from the 
activities of death squads in latin america to the harassment of 
church groups in china the mistreatment of imprisoned aborigines 
in australia and the lengthy pretrial detention of a puerto rican 
independence campaigner 
the report said more than half the worlds governments tortured 
or mistreated prisoners and onethird of them jailed prisoners of 
conscience whom amnesty international defines as those locked up 
for the nonviolent exercise of their human rights 
the report was written before many of the sweeping democratic 
reforms in eastern europe and the soviet union 
an accompanying summary touched only briefly on the june killing 
of hundreds perhaps thousands by chinese troops in beijing to 
quash the students prodemocracy protest 
it called those killings and the killing of hundreds of 
civilians by sri lankas security forces striking examples of 
continuing extrajudicial executions this year 
the report said the victims of illegal killings last year were 
government opponents members of ethnic or religious groups and 
civilians living in areas of military operations 
it said they were gunned down in groups or shot by snipers 
blown up by explosives stabbed strangled hacked to death or 
poisoned many were tortured to death in colombia guatemala el 
salvador syria and the philippines victims were often mutilated 
before being killed the report said 
it said governments made enormous efforts to conceal 
evidence of such killings but details were reaching the 
international community more rapidly than ever before 
killings are carried out at night when the victims are alone 
or in remote rural areas where even largescale troop movements can 
be undertaken unobserved the report said 
in urban areas specialized squads are trained to function in 
secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under 
curfew and police control 
amnesty international said many such killings occurred during 
armed conflict within countries including afghanistan ethiopia 
and burma 
warfare makes it easier to evade accountability not only is 
access by independent observers limited but the dead can be 
characterized as combatants or as the unavoidable civilian 
casualties of war the report said 
amnesty international said many people became victims simply 
because they lived in areas whose overall population was seen as 
the enemy 
it said iraqi forces attacked the kurdish population with 
chemical weapons killing 5000 men women and children in halabja 
survivors of chemical attacks were often summarily executed and in 
villages near the town of duhok more than 1000 executions in one 
day were reported it said 
many killings occurred during or after antigovernment 
demonstrations amnesty international said it expressed concern 
about the israelioccupied territories where more than 300 
palestinian civilians were killed in 1988 algeria where at least 
176 demonstrators died and tibet where chinese police killed 
dozens of proindependence demonstrators 
amnesty international said it documented prisoners of conscience 
in 76 countries in 1988 
among the worst offenders cited were turkey where thousands 
were detained for political reasons including hundreds of 
prisoners of conscience and greece where conscientious objectors 
to military service were in prison 
however 1566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide 
during 1988 or one in every three cases taken up by amnesty 
international more than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience 
in the soviet union in january 1988 were released by the end of the 
year 
detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75 
countries and torture and illtreatment was reported in 94 it 
said 
filberto ojeda rios a member of a puerto rican independence 
organization was held in connecticut for 32 months on charges of 
armed robbery it said a federal court finally ordered his release 
on bail but he was arrested again charged with a new offense and 
again held without bail it said 
amnesty international said he was held in virtual 
incommunicado detention with only limited access to lawyers 
amnesty international which opposes the death penalty as cruel 
and unusual punishment said 1240 people were sentenced to death 
in 58 countries last year 
it said those figures contain only confirmed cases and believes 
the true figures are certainly higher in iran for example 
142 executions were announced but amnesty international said it 
learned of at least 1700 secret ones

consumers in the future may find macintosh 
computers easier to buy than red mcintosh apples thanks to the 
chemical scare that led growers to stop using the growthregulator 
alar 
consumers will have to learn not to judge an apple by its color 
industry experts say because without alar it will be difficult to 
achieve the ripe reds of the past 
appearance in the future will not be as important as condition 
and eating quality said john odonnell marketing director of 
the new york and new england apple institute in westfield mass 
this is the first year that alar labeled a possible carcinogen 
by a consumer group in february was not widely used on the 
nations apple crop 
uniroyal chemical co voluntarily removed alar from the market 
last summer and the federal government has taken steps to ban it 
alar was sprayed on apple trees because of its ability to keep 
fruit on the tree longer that extended the harvest time allowed 
development of a deeper red coloring in mcintosh and other apples 
and retained their crispness in longterm storage alar also 
prevented skin splitting on red stayman and winesap varieties 
without altering taste 
now that the 1989 crop is being harvested growers report that 
red apples are not as red that the mcintosh crop is down and that 
staymans are cracking more ruining them for supermarket sales 
the immediate effect of doing without alar is obscured in 
washington which will produce about 60 percent of the nations 
supermarket apples because the state is harvesting a bumper crop 
but charles st john spokesman for the washington apple 
commission noted that apples in the halfbilliondollar washington 
crop have less internal firmness this year 
the future is more troubling for washington growers 
particularly in warm areas like the columbia river basin 
alar was needed to grow highquality apples in those warmer 
climates said jack watson washington state university extension 
agent for franklin county 
in warm climates you dont get a red apple and red seems to 
sell apples watson said 
that means growers in those areas are going to have to shift 
away from older varieties and plant something that isnt red 
watson said 
apples from warmer climates also will not store as well 
especially after nine or 10 months in storage said steve drake of 
the us department of agriculture research center in wenatchee 
other applegrowing regions also face problems 
in the virginiawest virginiapennsylvania region which grows 4 
percent of the nations freshmarket apples growers are 
experimenting with other varieties to supplement the mainstay red 
delicious said clayton griffin of the virginia apple board 
red stayman apples which split without alar make up 10 percent 
of virginias 50 million apple crop she said 
the mcintosh has been a mainstay of the new yorknew england 
region although the mcintosh crop this year was down to 71 
million bushels from the projected 83 million largely because of 
weather odonnell said in the future industry officials predict 
the variety will account for just 40 percent of the regions crop 
instead of the current 55 percent 
new york is the nations secondlargest apple producer at 10 
percent while the new england states combine for about 4 percent 
the extra time on the tree that alar produced was important in 
the northeast because many new england growers rely on visitors to 
pick the fruit from orchards 
without alar you have now cut the fourweek picking time to 
two weeks odonnell said economically youve lost half your 
ability to have the public come into orchards 
michigan supplies about 7 percent of the nations apples and 
growers there arent expecting much effect from the loss of alar 
because they havent used it in recent years said dave wade of the 
state department of agriculture 
the remainder of the nations apple production is scattered 
across several other states

amnesty international said wednesday it 
investigated allegations of prisoner mistreatment in the united 
states and raised concerns about one inmates lengthy pretrial 
detention in 1988 
in its annual global survey of human rights abuses amnesty 
international reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and 
said the 11 prisoners executed in the united states last year 
raised the total since 1977 to 104 
the death row population grew to an unprecedented 2182 
prisoners in 34 states by the end of the year it said 
amnesty international said it investigated reports that 
prisoners in several state prisons had been illtreated including 
the michael unit of the texas department of corrections where 
guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg 
irons 
the warden of michael unit informed amnesty international that 
no such incidents had occurred the report said 
amnesty international said it also looked into reports that 
prisoners in the administrative control unit of the southern ohio 
correctional facility were shackled and chained to cell fixtures 
others were alleged to have been sprayed with chemical mace and 
highpressure water and left in empty unheated cells for several 
days 
prison authorities denied that prisoners had been illtreated 
but admitted that shackles chains and mace were used for 
restraining purposes amnesty international said 
the organization said it also concluded that conditions in the 
high security unit of kentuckys lexington federal prison were 
substandard the unit has since been closed 
a federal court also ruled it was unconstitutional for two women 
convicted of politically motivated offenses to be held in the unit 
the court ordered their transfer into the general prison 
population saying conditions in the unit at times skirted 
elemental standards of human decency 
amnesty internationals observer at the court hearing submitted 
a report saying amnesty international concluded that the 
conditions of confinement constituted cruel inhuman or degrading 
treatment it found that the prisoners prolonged isolation 
humiliating stripsearches and additional restrictions had a 
detrimental effect on their physical and mental health 
amnesty international also raised concerns about filberto ojeda 
rios a puerto rican independence supporter held in pretrial 
detention in connecticut for 32 months on armed robbery charges 
a federal court ordered his release on bail in may 1988 saying 
due process cannot tolerate any further pretrial detention 
but he was arrested again three months later and charged with a new 
offense of assault relating to his original arrest in 1985 ojeda 
rios was denied bail and again placed in detention 
amnesty international said it was concerned his lengthy 
pretrial detention may have undermined his right to be tried 
within a reasonable period or else be released 
amnesty international said it also asked california gov george 
deukmejian to order an inquiry into a former member of the black 
panther party serving a life sentence in california for a 1972 
murder conviction 
elmer geronimo pratt may have been denied a fair trial 
because of his political activities amnesty international said it 
said new evidence obtained after pratts trial indicated he was 
targeted for neutralization by the fbi between 1968 and 1971 
because of his political activities 
it said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness 
was an fbi informant and that the fbi planted informers in pratts 
defense teams 
a 1985 court hearing dismissed pratts motion for a new trial 
ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an fbi contact 
not an informer and that pratt had not suffered as a result of the 
surveillance on his defense team in june 1988 the ninth circuit 
court of appeal also turned down his appeal on technical grounds 
amnesty international said deukmejian told them he was without 
the authority ability and resources to order an inquiry

an engineer hired to investigate the 
earthquaketriggered collapse of an oakland freeway was fired after 
just four days because of statements he made to a newspaper 
a former state engineer meanwhile said the pillars supporting 
interstate 880s upper deck collapsed because they didnt meet 
accepted safety standards at the time the freeway was built 32 
years ago 
gov george deukmejian on monday fired structural engineer ian 
buckle who had been asked to conduct a special inquiry into the 
fatal collapse 
the dismissal follows staunch criticism of the california 
transportation department by deukmejian after the freeway 
collapsed killing dozens of people 
transportation officials have said they were as surprised as 
deukmejian that the oct 17 earthquake sent the top level of 
interstate 880 crashing down 
the governor reiterated that he was never told the structure was 
a severe quake hazard state engineers said they didnt believe the 
structure or those like it would fall in a quake 
a state expert on soils stability glenn borchardt questioned 
one state engineers conclusion that soft ground beneath the 
freeway was not a big factor in its failure 
borchardt said the largely clay subsurface probably 
amplified the quake a condition that could have been avoided 
had pilings been driven to bedrock when the freeway was built 
deukmejian said his staff told buckle who works at the national 
center for earthquake engineering and research in buffalo ny 
that he could not head an inquiry into the collapse because he had 
expressed a viewpoint in an article in the los angeles times on 
thursday 
telephone calls to buckles home and office went unanswered 
monday 
in the article buckle wrote now is not the time to be 
knocking caltrans rather its time to push for more funds for 
earthquake safety buckle has performed other consulting work for 
california 
on sunday when deukmejian first publicly expressed concern 
about buckle the engineer declined to comment except to say he 
wrote the times piece before he was asked to head the inquiry 
the republican governor said he would replace buckle with 
someone who can be totally impartial and independent 
buckle last week inspected the wreckage and said it collapsed 
because it was an unfortunate combination of an old structure on 
soft ground 
chief state engineer bill schaefer said his department could not 
have warned the governor about the possibility of i880 collapsing 
because his engineers felt it would not fall apart in a quake 
deukmejian said he has always approved spending for earthquake 
safety and seemed to fault the department for not seeking money to 
expedite a threephase multimilliondollar bridge stabilization 
program that began after the 1971 san fernando quake 
while declining to comment directly on deukmejians criticism 
schaefer and top structural engineer jim roberts defended their 
departments failure to prevent the freeway collapse during a news 
conference roberts said is it my fault i was in college when 
this freeway was built it was designed to the technology of the 
day 
roberts also dismissed a section of a 1982 report to thengov 
jerry brown that said the freeway could collapse from bad ground 
which could even turn to liquid 
roberts who earlier suggested the soft ground played a role 
said his department geologist told him the structures pilings were 
driven to a very hard strata of compact sand and he the 
geologist said soil liquefaction is not a problem in that area 
but borchardt who wrote the 1982 section of the report for the 
governors emergency task force on earthquake preparedness noted 
that the pilings were not driven to bedrock an expensive endeavor 
given its depth of several hundred feet in the area 
when pilings are not sitting on bedrock you get 
amplification of the earthquake waves he said obviously if 
it had been built on bedrock it would not have collapsed he 
said 
the former state highway engineer jim see who now heads the 
pleasant hill public works department said the columns design 
should have included lateral bars running through the pillars like 
steel grids holding the vertical columns steady during a major 
quake 
see said the bracing that was missing is described as a 
necessary structural ingredient in columns in the 1952 engineers 
manual distributed by the concrete reinforcing steel institute a 
nonprofit chicago trade organization 
roberts acknowledged that the amount of lateral reinforcement 
built into the columns might have been inadequate but he insisted 
that the doubletiered portion of i880 had been built in 
accordance with what the building code required in 1957 
how significant they are is something for the governors 
investigation team to determine

thirteen thousand doctors have signed a petition 
asking a medical supply company to stop using surgical staplers on 
dogs when training its salespeople organizers said today 
the company us surgical corp of norwalk conn has been a 
subject of protests by animal rights groups the staplers can be 
used in some cases in place of stitches 
eight participants along with rusty a mixed golden retriever 
they said was rescued on its way to us surgical appeared at a 
manhattan news conference before leaving for norwalk where they 
hoped to present the petition to company officials 
we will turn them away said leon hirsch president of us 
surgical they are not welcome in our facility theres been 
too much animal rights terrorism 
this organization is a sham front said hirsch theyre a 
pseudomedical group of animal rights activists 
dr neal d barnard a washington dc psychiatrist and 
president of the physicians committee for responsible medicine 
contended us surgical laboratories kill about 1000 dogs a year 
after practicing stapling techniques on them 
former participants have reported that the strength of the 
staples was tested by attempting to lift the dogs by their staples 
and by attempting to tear the stapled organs apart said barnard 
barnard and other doctors and veterinarians said us surgical 
trains its salespeople with dogs in order to get a jump on 
competitors like the 3m company which does not use dogs 
us surgical says the dogs are anesthetized 
physicians committee members said most medical students learn to 
use instruments by observing other physicians and by practicing on 
cadavers or fake foam rubber organs making the use of dogs 
unnecessary

israeli foreign minister moshe arens has 
notified secretary of state james a baker iii that his government 
accepts a us plan for palestinian negotiations with two 
reservations the israeli embassy said today 
one proviso is that baker provide assurances that the palestine 
liberation organization will not participate in the talks the 
other is that any israeli meeting with palestinians before 
elections are conducted on the west bank and in gaza would be 
restricted to arrangements for the balloting said ruth yaron the 
embassy spokeswoman 
bakers spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the arens 
letter reinforces what we believe that they are engaged and they 
are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps 
ms tutwiler said all parties had tough decisions to make 
she added we are hopeful we can deal with all of their concerns 
and launch an israelipalestinian dialogue they key now is to get 
an agreement on a framework that will enable us to launch the 
dialogue 
at the same time ms tutwiler declined to describe arens 
letter as acceptance or rejection of bakers approach to 
negotiations 
arens letter outlining his governments position was delivered 
by ambasador moshe arad after baker returned monday from a speaking 
trip to san francisco 
he is not optimistic or pessimistic a us official said 
after baker read the letter he is realistic 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile told reporters 
during a tour of the golan heights that israel will agree to the 
plan after the changes we proposed are accepted 
he called the exchange with baker positive i dont see any 
large gap between our views and the proposals of the secretary of 
state but there are some differences he said 
the prime minister added that in a few days we will know if 
there is an agreement or not 
however members of the opposition labor party which supports 
the baker proposal without reservations said they would stage a 
walkout in parliament to protest the governments stand 
i dont see anything in bakers proposal that needs to be 
changed said labor leader shirom peres 
arens informed baker in the letter that israel accepted 
basically his fivepoint proposal for a meeting with 
palestinians mrs yaron said 
bakers proposal included an assurance that israel would be 
satisfied with the composition of the delegation and it 
assigned egyptian president hosni mubarak a middleman role of 
consulting with the plo 
however mrs yaron said arens also requested what she called 
two tactical changes one would assure israel that the plo 
would not participate in the meeting and the other would limit the 
agenda to the election itself 
shamir arens and other members of the ruling likud coalition 
have been concerned from the outset that the meeting would turn 
into a negotiating session shamirs election plan provides for 
negotiations after the 14 million palestinians on the west bank 
and in gaza choose their representatives 
the plo meanwhile has rejected both the shamir and baker 
proposals it was not clear whether an israelipalestinian meeting 
could be held without at least plo acquiesence 
we have been saying all along that we do want to advance the 
peace process mrs yaron told a reporter however we had two 
concerns participation of the plo and the agenda in order not 
to set back the peace process 
baker was expected to reply to arens but the israeli foreign 
minister was on a trip to brussels which could delay temporarily 
further contact between the two officials 
last week as bakers drive to set up negotiations approached a 
critical point shamir appealed for us help in drawing 
palestinian arabs into the election plan 
shamir in a letter to baker delivered last wednesday urged the 
administration to help overcome intimidation keeping 
palestinians on the west bank and gaza from participating in the 
prime ministers proposal for elections diplomatic sources said 
shamir also asked baker to try to enlist moderate arab 
governments such as morocco and jordan to join with egypt in 
trying to implement the elections proposal said the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
baker followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with 
shamir last thursday evening and with foreign minister arens on 
friday morning he then went to his ranch in wyoming for the 
weekend and to san francisco for the arms control speech on monday 
a senior us official said on friday that baker was not going 
to pursue this from here to eternity also the official said 
baker was giving the palestinian problem 100 percent but there 
could be a limit to how long you continue 
but the diplomaic sources questioned the notion that baker was 
reaching a dead end 
you have a dialogue at the very highest level it is very 
substantial they are discussing substantial ideas that might lead 
to a breakthrough said one source 
bakers fivepoint proposal was put forward privately last month 
in an effort to implement shamirs election plan while only the 
fifth point a meeting be held with israel and egypt before the 
election has been officially confirmed the four others are known 
to include 
talks be held between israel and palestinians 
the meeting is designed to hold elections 
israel is to be satisfied with the delegations 
composition 
mubarak is free to consult any middle eastern parties about 
the makeup of the delegation

in one of southern californias worst cases 
of animal neglect in years horses on a ranch have been so underfed 
that they chew on wooden fence posts and eat their own manure 
at least a dozen horses on the allmond family ranch walk 
painfully on unclipped hooves sleep in their own urine in unkempt 
stables and have swelled stomachs a symptom of worms 
nearby ranchers have been complaining about the ranch to animal 
control officials for months but said nothing was done until 
recently they said it must have taken about a year for the horses 
conditions to deteriorate 
this whole thing makes me sick said brigitte richardson a 
horse breeder and one of several residents pressing riverside 
county animal control officers for action here we are sending 
aid to foreign countries and this is happening in the heart of our 
country 
for as long as anyone can remember the ranch has been operated 
almost singlehandedly by gil allmond who said he is 79 years old 
but is believed by friends to be in his mid80s 
the ranch about 65 miles southeast of los angeles is owned by 
allmonds son ed allmond a certified horse show judge who animal 
control officials said is now working with the county to set up a 
feeding and veterinary schedule for the horses 
pressure on the county peaked oct 11 when one of the ranchs 
horses a former champion show mare had to be destroyed after it 
apparently was improperly fed 
when a reporter visited the allmond ranch last week about 20 of 
the ranchs 30 horses were so skinny their ribs hip bones and 
spines protruded wooden fence posts and the top of a gate had been 
chewed away by the horses many of the animals were eating their 
own feces 
some horses had matted hair and skin sores from lying in their 
urine some walked awkwardly on hooves that hadnt been trimmed in 
months 
ive been working with horses for years and ive never seen 
anything this bad said horse breeder brian seaman 
the matter may be referred to the district attorney for legal 
action 
the elder allmond denied that he has mistreated the animals and 
said they are properly fed daily 
some of the horses are ok and some are not he said some 
are real old and are going to have to be destroyed that mare that 
was destroyed was 30 years old and just couldnt go on any more 
ed allmond who lives in nearby san jacinto did not return a 
reporters telephone message tuesday 
emmett gibson the countys chief animal control officer said 
action against the allmonds wont be taken until a veterinarian 
called in finishes a report on his inspection of the ranch earlier 
this month 
the ranch has emerged as one of southern californias worst 
cases of animal neglect since humane officers in 1975 discovered 
100 horses starving on breeder rex c ellsworths ranch in chino

the justice department has tightened its rules 
for bringing racketeering cases and for seizing defendants assets 
before trial according to memos released tuesday 
a policy requiring approval by senior justice department 
officials of efforts to seize a defendants assets was imposed in 
response to criticism of the tactic in several highly publicized 
cases according to one of the memos which were sent to federal 
prosecutors 
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act allows 
prosecutors to obtain temporary restraining orders to seize assets 
of defendants to ensure the funds are available if a jury orders 
them forfeited as part of a verdict 
but assistant attorney general edward sg dennis jr said 
prosecutors should make clear in court that the government will 
not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of 
the defendant 
some highly publicized cases have been the subject of 
considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that 
pretrial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property 
without due process dennis wrote in the june 30 memorandum 
another memo by assistant attorney general shirley d peterson 
head of the tax division sharply limits the use of the rico law in 
taxfraud cases 
mailfraud charges may be sustituted for taxfraud charges to 
form the basis of rico prosecutions only in exceptional 
circumstances when a tax return is mailed to promote a 
taxfraud scheme she wrote in a separate memorandum 
charging a tax offense as a mailfraud charge could be viewed 
as circumventing congressional intent unless unique circumtances 
justifying the use of a mailfraud charge are present peterson 
wrote 
dennis who heads the departments criminal division did not 
mention any specific pretrial asset seizures that prompted 
criticism 
but defense attorneys roundly criticized former manhattan us 
attorney rudolph giuliani for obtaining a court order seizing the 
assets of a securities firm whose officers were charged with 
racketeering 
defense lawyers contend that the governments forfeiture demands 
drove the firm princetonnewport partners lp out of business last 
december 
jurors who convicted five princetonnewport partners and a sixth 
defendant of racketeering charges in august awarded only 38 
million of the 21 million prosecutors sought in forfeitures with 
3 million coming from one defendant 
originally targeted at organized crime and drug traffickers the 
rico law was used for the first time in the princetonnewport case 
to prosecute securities dealers 
it has since been used as a basis to indict 46 commodities 
traders in chicago michael r millken the former head of drexel 
burnham lambert incs junk bond department is awaiting trial 
next march on racketeering charges 
justice department spokesman david runkel said both memos 
underscored existing department policy 
but dennis wrote that his memo implements new policy 
requiring approval by the justice departments organized crime and 
racketeering section before prosecutors seek temporary restraining 
orders to seize a defendants assets 
to get such approval the prosecutor must show that 
lessintrusive remedies such as bonds are not likely to preserve 
the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction dennis 
wrote in the memo first disclosed over the weekend in newsday the 
long island ny newspaper 
he noted that the governments policy is not to seek the 
fullest forfeiture permissable under the law where that forfeiture 
would be disproportionate to the defendants crime 
forfeiture orders dennis noted can have a wideranging 
impact on third parties who do business with the defendants 
including clients vendors banks investors creditors dependents 
and others 
the new requirements were instituted to ensure that the rights 
of all interested parties are protected dennis said 
runkel dimissed suggestions that dennis memo was issued in 
response to tactics employed by giuliani who is now the 
republicanliberal candidate for mayor in new york city to the 
best of my knowledge the answer to that is no runkel said 
runkel noted that the governments assetforfeiture actions in 
the princetonnewport case were upheld in the courts

its become a cliche that every disaster is 
followed by a lawyer looking to turn tragedy into a quick buck but 
the state bar says that doesnt seem to be the case with the 
northern california earthquake 
so far say officials of state and local legal organizations 
the response of lawyers to the oct 17 quake has been to offer free 
or lowcost help to victims still some lawyers stand to make 
substantial sums down the road if they can provide liability for 
damage injury or death 
we have not received by phone any complaints of unethical 
solicitation of clients maybe in part due to the fact that we 
got out there early and acted as a deterrent clayton anderson 
director of investigations for the 117000member state bar said 
monday 
on a national basis historically there as been solicitation 
in disasters the legal profession is trying to put a stop to 
that 
he said the bar distributed 6000 leaflets to legal groups and 
shelters for earthquake victims spelling out rules on 
solicitation a lawyer can advertise services but cant go to an 
accident scene or hospital to recruit clients for example a 
tollfree number is listed for complaints 
the california trial lawyers association whose members often 
represent victims in injury lawsuits has promised to guard against 
ambulancechasing the office of famed injury lawyer melvin belli 
which says it will sue the state over the collapse of a freeway 
overpass in the quake says its attorneys are being careful not to 
solicit clients 
meanwhile lawyers are being mobilized to help those injured or 
displaced by the earthquake 
volunteer lawyers will be stationed at clinics run by the 
federal emergency management agency helping people apply for 
benefits said nancy clinch of the bars board of governors 
within three hours of the earthquake the state bar was 
organizing those clinics said ms clinch who organized legal 
clinics after a september 1988 fire that destroyed more than 200 
homes in nevada county its a wonderful opportunity for lawyers 
to become involved 
we called people saturday morning for a 2 oclock clinic many 
still digging out of their own rubble and people just dropped 
everything and came down here said drucilla ramey executive 
director of the bar association of san francisco 
plans for clinics include presentations by federal disaster 
officials insurance representatives landlordtenant experts and 
others then participants could speak with volunteer lawyers 
more information is to be provided through tollfree telephone 
numbers already set up by several counties and the state bar 
ms ramey said common concerns of tenants of damaged buildings 
include rent obligations getting security deposits back and rights 
when buildings are demolished 
inquiries are also numerous about whether homeowners insurance 
covers earthquakes the advice is to file a claim in every case 
and about federal aid and the rights of employees said lawyers 
most county bar associations have ongoing lawyer referral 
programs although free service is normally provided only after a 
financial screening i imagine substantially all of it will be 
pro bono free in the next few weeks said stephen schadlich 
president of the alameda county bar association 
at some point however some lawyers will be talking about 
lawsuits involving large sums of money 
richard e brown of bellis office said it has been contacted by 
relatives of people who may have died in the collapse of interstate 
880 in oakland and are interested in suing the state 
but brown said belli has not contacted any victims or relatives 
hed lose his license if hed done that and instead has two 
lawyers working fulltime to offer free legal consultations on 
earthquakerelated matters fees would be charged only if a lawsuit 
were filed

professor william lutz can live with ordinary 
euphemisms but his teeth gnash when a worker is told he has been 
dehired because the firm is experiencing negative employee 
retention 
the employee has been fired in a layoff but no one is willing 
to say so laments lutz who has written doublespeak a book 
denouncing the use of words to conceal meaning 
in lutzs book patients dont experience pain just 
discomfort too much of that and terminal living may occur 
thats death so is negative patient care outcome 
lutz is willing to accept terms that gloss over unpleasant 
truths passed away and rest room for example but balks 
when airlines announce that the plane is in no condition to fly 
ladies and gentlemen because of a technical difficulty there 
will be a change of equipment will you please deplane at this 
time 
he doesnt like it either even when all goes smoothly and 
the equipment has arrived and is now being serviced prior to our 
beginning the preboarding process 
but it is going just too far says lutz when the pentagon 
refers to bombs that accidentally kill civilians as incontinent

corrupt thought 
he thinks the practice is disgraceful dangerous to democracy 
perverse and pervasive 
hard work too doublespeak isnt just the natural work product 
of the bureaucratic mind he says it is invented painstakingly by 
committees laboring to cloak what the words arent permitted to say 
doublespeak is not a slip of the tongue or language used out 
of ignorance but is instead a very conscious use of language as a 
weapon or tool by those in power to achieve their ends at our 
expense he writes 
lutz 48 teaches english at the camden campus of rutgers 
university in new jersey and heads the committee on public 
doublespeak of the national council of teachers of english 
i have a real sense of outrage that something as beautiful and 
powerful as language is being perverted he said in an interview 
i think that language is the most precious invention of human 
beings 
doublespeak is used by bureaucrats like those who wrote a 
government safety pamphlet that says exit access is that part of 
a means of egress that leads to an entrance or an exit but it is 
also used by businessmen advertisers and educators who call 
classrooms pupil stations and students from poor homes the 
economically nonaffluent 
in the work world people who are fired in doublespeak are 
dehired or nonretained or nonrenewed or selected 
out by firms that are having workforce adjustments or 
headcount reductions

folks in boston and chicago may have 
been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh california strawberries 
last wednesday and thursday 
electrical failures after last tuesdays earthquake meant 
125000 crates of berries many bound for east and midwest markets 
from this farming community were left unrefrigerated overnight 
by the time they reached their destinations they were spoiled 
a week after the quake forced more than 1000 residents into 
tents and shelters employers still are assessing their losses 
i would not be one to say losses will be minimal under the 
circumstances they might be considered minimal but to the 
individual they are pretty severe said santa cruz county 
agricultural commissioner leonard kraft 
an estimated 5 million to 6 milion worth of crops were bruised 
or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins according to ron 
tyler of the agricultural extension service 
and losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the 
countrys frozen foods wont be known until workers determine how 
much of the produce shaken from 30foothigh shelves can be 
repacked and how much must be thrown out 
most companies say those losses should be small indicating that 
while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli 
cauliflower and brussels sprouts have been slowed the industry 
isnt devastated 
i dont think theres a doubt the industry will rebound 
kraft said its the heart and soul of the area 
more than 7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto 
the warehouse floor at the richard a shaw inc frozen food 
company but president jeffrey shaw said he expects most of the 
vegetables can be repacked 
were hoping 500000 in losses is a worst case shaw 
said were hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of 
whats on the floor our focus is going to be on shipping 
merchandise ship now and clean up later weve got to ship to 
create space to speed up the cleanup 
strawberry packers are expecting very little loss the season 
ends nov 1 so were fortunate it happened at this time theres 
not really much to recover from since were near the end anyway 
said herb baum president of naturipe berry growers 
but stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7000 
residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food 
processing plants here 
the personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by 
the lack of a place to work green giant expects to be closed for 
at least two weeks leaving 600 people out of work and shaw inc 
is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees 
not only have they lost their jobs but there are no 
alternatives left in town jeffrey shaw said 
even the agriculture industry which makes up 65 percent of the 
communitys economy may not be strong enough to rebuild the town 
by itself 
we have quite a large population in the city who work in 
agriculture and all the downtown store owners depend on people to 
spend their paychecks at the store kraft said 
a lot of peoples homes are destroyed he added those 
people may work in agriculture but thats not going to help

rescuers found one body today and planned 
an extensive search for 22 missing workers in the smoldering rubble 
of a plastics plant where fiery explosions killed at least two 
people and injured 124 
the body was found by six firefighters and safety experts who 
ventured into the devastated phillips petroleum co complex where 
explosions monday afternoon flung debris five miles and shook the 
ground 25 miles away 
the emergency response team decided it was safe to send a larger 
search party in later today sheriff johnny klevenhagen said he 
said they would need heavy equipment to move the body and search 
for others in the rubble 
its going to take a long time this is not going to be easy 
some of the buildings are gone not there klevenhagen said 
authorities varied on whether there could be survivors 
you always hope for the best our fingers are crossed said 
phillips spokesman jere smith 
we dont think theres anybody alive in there said dr paul 
pepe director of houstons emergency medical services 
doctors treated 124 people for injuries thirtyfive were 
hospitalized up to six of them in critical condition pepe said 
some had severe burns he said 
survivors said they had less than half a minutes warning to get 
out of the plant after a reactor began leaking flammable gas that 
ignited in a huge fireball 
i thought it was the end said billy ridenour a 35yearold 
worker i was thinking run till you die 
a thin column of smoke was rising from the plant this morning as 
several members of an emergency response team went inside phillips 
officials said the fire was contained and the smoke and gas 
released were not toxic but that the team would have to judge 
whether it was safe to send in a larger group of rescuers 
the fire is just about out that was the objective 
overnight said jere smith a phillips spokesman at the scene 
with daylight now we can start to account for the unaccounted 
twenty phillips employees and at least three contract workers 
were unaccounted for phillips petroleum president glenn cox told 
reporters late monday the body of a worker was found at the plant 
but cox did not have other details 
we know these people we pray for their safety cox said 
its a difficult time for all of us 
seismologists at rice university in nearby houston said the 
blast appeared to be the equivalent of 10 tons of dynamite the 
first explosion could be felt as far away as 25 miles several 
explosions followed 
it was like somebody just dropped an atomic bomb said kelly 
manerly a pipefitter at the plant which makes 45 million pounds 
a day of plastics like those used in milk jugs and toys 
the blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out cafeteria windows at 
an elementary school about a mile away no one was injured but the 
schools 700 pupils were sent home 
the first explosion at phillips houston chemical complex on 
the houston ship channel just off highway 225 occurred early 
monday afternoon 
maintenance worker roby clemons said employees had 20 seconds to 
escape after a warning message was broadcast over the plants 
emergency radio 
workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud 
the explosion that followed knocked them off their feet 
many then saw a fireball 
it looked like somebody set a boulder on fire and was rolling 
it towards us said terry crowson 37 a construction worker 
everybody was aduckin adodgin and arunnin said de 
sonny mann 49 an ironworker foreman who was able to account for 
his 150man crew we outran the fire 
i never saw people run so fast added clemons 
firefighters fought the blaze by pumping water from a sewage 
treatment plant and the nearby ship channel the fire was brought 
under control within five hours but continued to burn a twomile 
section of the heavilytraveled channel was closed for seven hours 
authorities said no ships reported damage 
officials didnt immediately know what caused the explosion 
phillips environmental director bill stoltz said a seal blew out 
on an ethylene loop reactor releasing ethyleneisobutane a 
compound used in making plastics the reactor is built of tubes 
where the key chemical reactions take place 
the ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from sweeny 
about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town if 100000 
people 
the pipeline was shut down after the blast but up to 90000 
gallons of ethylene and plastics were believed to have burned said 
sam l price houston fire department spokesman 
more than 900 people work in shifts at the plant built in 1948 
on the 800acre complex said dave dryden phillips spokesman at 
company headquarters in bartlesville okla 
the blast sent pieces of metal flying through the air 
glen dickey who lives five miles from the plant said he came 
home from lunch to find a 6foot piece of metal in a tree 
pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky dickey said

finland which has lived in the shadow 
of its huge soviet neighbor since world war ii is hoping president 
mikhail s gorbachev will finally recognize finnish neutrality 
during a visit this week 
such a declaration could once and for all bury the notion of 
finlandization and open a new chapter in relations analysts 
said 
gorbachev accompanied by his wife raisa arrives wednesday for 
a threeday visit crammed into a busy year of traveling that has 
included trips to britain cuba romania east germany west 
germany and france 
gorbachev will meet with president mauno koivisto and the two 
countries will sign agreements on bilateral trade joint ventures 
and transboundary pollution control 
the two leaders also may sign a joint declaration which for the 
first time describes this country as neutral finland earlier 
communiques have said only that finland aspires toward a peaceful 
policy of neutrality 
finland was an autonomous grand duchy of russia for 100 years 
before the 1917 russian revolution when vladimir i lenin granted 
finland its independence in gratitude for hiding him from czarist 
forces 
gorbachev is scheduled to pay tribute to finlands assistance to 
the founder of the soviet state with a visit wednesday to a room 
where lenin stayed while in helsinki 
he also is scheduled to meet with finnish business leaders 
visit parliament and travel to the northern city of oulu dubbed 
the city of technology 
gorbachev badly needs western technology and goods to revive the 
stagnant soviet economy that suffers from chronic shortages of 
consumer goods and food and finnish companies have a long 
tradition of doing business with the soviets 
finland is the soviet unions no 2 trading partner among 
capitalist countries and it imports 80 percent of its oil from its 
communist neighbor the fall in international oil prices has thrown 
off the two countries trade balance but several trade agreements 
will be signed during gorbachevs visit including on joint 
ventures and finnish involvement in the industrial development of 
the soviet unions strategically important kola peninsula 
the two countries have become friends and major trading partners 
despite a bloody history the soviet union and finland fought two 
wars from 193944 and finland was forced to cede large parts of 
its eastern territory 
in 1948 the two countries signed the treaty of friendship 
cooperation and mutual assistance and finland adopted a neutral 
stance which depended heavily on good relations with its eastern 
superpower 
traditionally the soviets have been reluctant to openly and 
publicly recognize finlands neutrality said raimo vayrynen an 
international politics professor at the university of helsinki 
there have always been qualifications he said in an 
interview vayrynen said he welcomes reports that the declaration 
to be signed during gorbachevs visit will contain unequivocal 
recognition of our neutrality 
despite vayrynens hopes the soviets are not hinting yet of any 
change in their position andrei s grachev deputy chief of the 
soviet communist partys central committees international 
department said the kremlin has no reason to redefine finlands 
neutrality 
several decades of cooperation between finland and the soviet 
union have strengthened mutual trust and the value of finlands 
neutrality in our bilateral relations grachev said 
after world war ii soviet interference in finnish domestic 
politics was common and the term finlandization was coined to 
describe this countrys allegiance to the soviets 
but relations have become more open and natural 
certainly there has been a big change vayrynen said 
referring to gorbachevs policy of openness he continued 
glasnost has alleviated some of the anxieties that existed about 
the potential consequences of finns taking a stand on issues that 
might offend the soviets 
grachev said the earlier denigrating use of finlandization 
was shortsighted and that other countries could use 
sovietfinnish relations as a model 
the finlandization of europe may be regarded nowadays as the 
spreading and development of the whole european process which has 
proved in the past years to be of mutual benefit practically to all 
states in both parts of this continent grachev said

stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading 
today as the collapse of the ual corp buyout helped unnerve an 
already shaky market 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials spiked downward as much 
as 85 points in the morning before partially rebounding it was 
down 4836 points to 261455 by 2 pm edt 
in addition to the ual buyout failure analysts said traders 
were worried about lowerthanexpected corporate profits in the 
third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the governments 
latest report on factory orders 
declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 11 to 2 on the 
new york stock exchange with 246 higher 1348 lower and 313 
unchanged

airlines independent for now as it examines alternatives to a 
300ashare employeemanagement buyout plan that collapsed earlier

hungarians proclaimed a democracy and 
honored the longmaligned 1956 revolt but on tuesday they had the 
same leaders and the same problems how to tell truth from lies and 
live on 100 a month or less 
a day after the heady celebration a pensioner said he hoped for 
a price freeze so we can live better with annual inflation 
above 20 percent and the government lifting food subsidies under 
market reforms his wife said they can afford meat only on sundays 
an estimated 100000 hungarians cheered the new democratic 
republic monday when acting president matyas szueroes proclaimed it 
from the parliament balcony 
that evening even more filled the same square to honor the 
antistalinist revolt of 1956 which was crushed by soviet troops 
they applauded proclamations by former revolutionaries that real 
democracy will be achieved only when hungarians can elect leaders 
of their choice 
although the communist party has changed its name oneparty 
rule remains in force at least until planned multiparty elections 
planned for next year 
hungary has committed itself on the path to democracy 
parliament adopted legislation last week creating the legal 
framework for the first free elections in more than 40 years and 
before that the communist party disbanded in favor of a new 
socialist party committed to democracy 
economic survival was a common topic on the street tuesday many 
hungarians place their hopes in premier miklos nemeth a 
41yearold economist who is introducing market forces and private 
ownership 
for the past 40 years we have heard nothing but lies the 
retired couple said in unison they and others interviewed would 
not give their names 
the husband said lies continued but at least the leadership 
has finally expressed the truth about what happened here 33 years 
ago 
he and his wife live on a small pension and constantly face 
poverty which official statistics say threatens 25 percent of 
hungarys 106 million people 
even for working people the average wage barely exceeds the 
equivalent of 100 a month 
as the retired couple spoke a woman nearby counted bottles she 
had collected to redeem for the deposits westerners notice an 
increasing number of pensioners stopping them on the street to ask 
for change 
an 18yearold cook said hungary had experienced tremendous 
changes in the past year but i will be optimistic when i dont 
see any communists anywhere he expressed faith in nemeths 
ability to run the government 
a store clerk said i trust nemeth because hes relatively 
young and a technocrat 
the premier who studied at karl marx university in budapest and 
at harvard is committed to a marketoriented economy as part of 
any reform program 
a pensioner from a village nea lake balaton said economic reform 
would allow ordinary hungarians to have a better future once a 
market economy is created 
he said he had to supplement a monthly pension of 5000 forints 
less than 100 with parttime work at the post office and selling 
produce from his garden 
a young book vendor said the changes this month indicated 
something has begun to move and we just have to hope concrete 
changes will come

mississippis segregationist watchdog 
agency supplied state lawmakers officials and educators a standard 
speech promoting segregation to deliver before northern audiences 
in 1963 
the speech claimed separate drinking fountains and bathrooms 
were necessary because many blacks lacked morals education and 
proper hygiene according to a copy obtained by the clarionledger 
there are many negroes of course who have reached plateaus 
of citizenship the speech says they are personally clean 
have high morals and are educated however they are still in the 
minority 
the nowdefunct statesponsored sovereignty commission spied 
on infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups during the 1960s 
it also funded the white citizens council an organization 
established to promote segregation 
erle johnston jr of forest who plans to describe the 
commission and the events of the 1960s in a book said he wrote the 
speech and its accompanying answers to questions expected from the 
northern news media 
johnston who usually accompanied the speakers handled public 
relations for the commission in the 1960s before serving as its 
director from 1963 through 1967 
johnston defended the speech as appropriate for its time we 
were trying to let people know how things worked in mississippi we 
didnt try to convert a soul we just tried to tell them how things 
worked he said 
segregation in the 1960s was in its death throes and its 
defenders resorted to any means of survival said david 
sansing a professor of history at the university of mississippi 
a society that discriminates and exploits will not mind lying 
it would just do whatever it had to do to justify a system that had 
no defense sansing said 
the commission paid air fare meals and other expenses for the 
volunteer speakers who included a reporter from the 
clarionledger wellknown in the 1960s for its hard line against 
integration 
titled the message from mississippi the speech claims 
mississippi blacks preferred segregationist ways 
many of our colored leaders ministers educators and 
newspaper editors openly endorse the separate school system and 
repudiate the outsiders who come into mississippi to violate our 
laws the speech says 
the questions and answers discuss two of mississippis most 
infamous civil rights slayings referring to both as unsolved 
murders 
seven days after 14yearold chicago native emmett till 
whistled at a white store owners wife his body was pulled from 
the tallahatchie river in tallahatchie county on aug 31 1955 he 
had been beaten and shot once in the head 
an allwhite jury acquitted two white men of the killing 
while tills slaying was a crime of violence we deplore the 
speech says what till did was a very serious offense although 
it was not deserving of capital punishment 
on april 24 1959 in poplarville a mob of at least 23 white 
men dragged mack parker a black 23yearold truck driver accused 
of raping a white woman from his jail cell shot him weighted him 
with chains and threw his body in the pearl river 
the speech claims the killing took place because 
mississippians had watched as court decrees stayed the execution 
of a st louis negro robert goldsby who shot down a white woman 
as she was trying to protect her husband 
the speech also claims that the federal government was 
responsible for the riot that resulted in two deaths following the 
1962 admission of james meredith into the university of mississippi 
as its first black student 
there was no disturbance no injury no death so long as the 
state of mississippi was permitted to be responsible for law and 
order in mississippi the speech says it was only when the 
federal authorities acted hastily in firing tear gas into a group 
of students and others that violence injury death and destruction 
of property resulted

ploallied gangs with fanciful 
names like black panther brigades and red eagles are blamed 
for most of the 20 murders here of arabs accused of collaborating 
with israel 
israeli officials claim some gangs operate under direct order of 
the plo but palestinians maintain that at least some of the 
murders have been carried out in defiance of plo chairman yasser 
arafat 
with 132 palestinians killed for alleged collaboration in the 
22monthold palestinian uprising there are fears that the 
executions are getting out of hand palestinians complain that 
ordinary citizens are being intimidated by the frequent murders 
in nablus last week the red eagles killed a 24yearold 
upholstery worker and wheeled his body through the streets of the 
west banks largest city in a pushcart presumably as a warning to 
others 
in the occupied gaza strip a school guard was found burned to 
death in his car oct 5 and graffiti signed by the palestinian 
revolutionary eagles took responsibility the slaying 
a senior israeli defense official on tuesday confirmed a report 
in the new york times that security forces had discovered documents 
linking the revolutionary eagles in gaza to yasser arafats 
mainstream plo faction fatah 
one letter quoted by the times says slayings should be blamed on 
the littleknown eagles group in order to deflect blame from the 
plo 
the times said however that the documents could be forgeries 
if genuine the papers could give credence to israels repeated 
arguments that arafat is sponsoring murder despite his claim to 
have renounced terrorism in december 
israeli officials have frequently cited the slayings of 
palestinians by fellow arabs as reason for the united states to 
halt its dialogue with the plo begun after arafats statement on 
terrorism 
the pace of the killings has quickened as the uprising has 
dragged on without political gains of the 132 slayings by 
palestinians since the revolt erupted in december 1987 110 
occurred this year alone 
at least 601 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians during the revolt and 40 israelis also have died 
palestinian sources say the murders of some supposed 
collaborators claimed by such groups as the abu jihad phalangists 
are ordered by opponents of arafats policies 
the red eagles in nablus are believed backed by the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine a radical syrianbased plo 
faction that opposes arafats efforts to negotiate an agreement 
with israel 
in nablus residents of the yasmina quarter where the black 
panthers operate say the gang is murdering people despite appeals 
from plobacked uprising leaders and arafat himself 
they say the gangs members believed to be 10 men ages 19 to 
25 wander freely through the dark twisting alleys of yasmina 
often armed with knives hatchets or pistols 
people are scared to death a 32yearold yasmina shopkeeper 
said they are afraid to leave their houses 
the shopkeeper like others who agreed to discuss the black 
panther slayings would not allow his name to be used out of fear 
nablus residents and local journalists said the black panthers 
have carried out 15 or 16 of the 20 slayings in the city most of 
alleged collaborators but also including prostitutes and drug 
dealers who some activists consider enemies of the uprising 
the black panthers are allied with arafats fatah plo faction 
but local fatah officials say the gangs members are running out of 
control ignoring orders in uprising leaflets that any killings

they are not educated enough to be judges they are working 
against the intefadeh said one fatah leader in nablus 
two weeks ago residents listened carefully to an appeal from 
arafat on the plos radio station in iraq urging more control in 
slayings of collaborators they say the statement was clearly aimed 
at the black panthers 
neither arafat nor uprising leaders have condemned collaborator 
killings outright however and there is widespread support for 
killing palestinians who endanger the lives of activists by 
informing on them 
arafat in an interview early this month with a londonbased

leaders to order murders of those proven to be collaborators 
the unified command has the right to kill all those who

emanuel ungaros sexy sirens have grown up into 
savvy sophisticates for next springs line of luxury readytowear 
clothes 
as other designers showed bare skin and molded cutout clothes 
for next spring ungaros look was downright ladylike 
following his offthewall couture collection last summer he 
went to a looser cooler mood for this his many fans will be 
happy not that there arent curves for next season his line 
simply refines and streamlines some of his past fraughtwithdetail 
ideas and hourglass shapes 
even the draped bustier flowered silks and the flirty peplum 
suits had a light touch his patterns were softer and the short 
sheaths caressed the body rather than constricting it to look like 
a vamp 
the daytime separates lateday black silk draped dresses and 
resort wear were much better than the unconvincing evening clothes 
which resumed in a few sparkling lame drapes and black 
ungaros highpowered shoulders have deflated into light padding 
for shape with some mildly puffy sleeves but theres still plenty 
of exuberance in fitted peplum or bolero checked jackets with pink 
or yellow piping flowered print crepe skirts in shades of orange 
and blue 
some noteworthy touches for parties include the solid flared 
anklelength shiny jersey skirts topped with fabulous softly 
shaded paisley linen jackets and big pirate hats 
ungaro still flings colors and floral prints about like a zany 
mixmaster but his combinations are good the wildflower fitted 
jackets some with vests look great with their sexy wrapped jersey 
blouses lean plaid or checked skirts the waists are always 
waspysmall and there is plenty of decollete to show off the chest 
ungaros easier softer mood also produced a raft of shifts and 
smocky toppers with puffy sleeves as well as some wonderful safari 
suits with easy cropped wide pants 
they looked restful but beautifully cut with firmly belted 
tunics and color combinations of prune brown violet and peach in 
soft linens 
at guy laroche readytowear designer guy douviers sailor 
looks wont rock any boats but theyre jaunty and wearable the 
organzatopped evening wear and sunnysideup flower prints were a 
youthful synthesis of the polite side of paris clothes for next 
summer 
not wildly original the house of laroche regularly makes the 
grade with women who like to dress in qualitymanufactured 
bigname lines for a little less money bernadette chirac wife of 
the paris mayor was in the audience and unfailingly chooses a 
laroche model or two 
from smockytopped sheer black and white print blackandwhite 
pajama outfits to the giant poppies on fitted pique suits there 
was a variety of colors and shapely lines in easytowear clothes 
the puffy and bowed organza toppers in hot yellow turquoise and 
indian rose or shocking pink with black crepe draped sheaths or 
lean pants are just in tune with the flouncy mood of paris for next 
summer 
the sophisticated but young clothes at the small house of 
lecoanethemant are still only available in a few shops but their 
line will come out en masse and with serious distribution next 
spring thanks to japanese backing 
their jazziest cruise wear came out in hotcolored majorcan 
print cotton pedal pushers with eyeletedged overblouses 
women headed to biarritz or the ritz will like the curvaceous 
silk bicolored cocktail suits and bodyconscious linen dresses with 
cutouts 
the original bluebrown damasked jeans teamed with a sequined 
pearled box jacket gave a surprising grace note to this lilting 
collection 
madame rose mett alias torrente launched a readytowear line 
called miss torrente calling it timeless classics for 
dynamic young women today 
like most other designers she took a cruise with some pretty 
sailor suits goldbuttoned at the shoulders her soft flower 
prints puffedsleeve silk dinner dresses navy coat dresses would 
fit in nicely for lunch at angelinas the tearoom where she showed 
the sleek but unpretentious collection 
her nephew olivier lapidus son of ted put on his first big 
tent show at the louvre the 30yearold designer who has studied 
in japan has a fair way to go the clothes werent all bad but 
the show was awkward 
according to lapidus sister rose mett olivier is being backed 
by the former ted lapidus money as lapidus himself bows quietly 
out 
young lapidus cotton sundresses and shorts jumpsuits in rust 
saffron and other spicy colors looked fine for the riviera if not 
for the smarter deauville set the fitted plaid or chevron jackets 
stiffened and curved out at hips were reminiscent of jeanpaul 
gaultier circa 1986 
better offerings in the uneven collection included the 
grapelike print skirts with loose overblouses and the iridescent 
graded mousseline tucked sleeveless sheaths

conservative republican sen phil gramm fueled 
speculation tuesday that he would be a candidate for president in 
1996 saying he is considering a race for the white house at the 
end of his second term in the senate 
if i ever heard the call i wouldnt be afraid to answer the 
call gramm 46 said in an interview i dont know whether it

1990

the first time on jan 3 1979 and leaning over to fellow texas 
rep kent hance who said reckon how many people standing here 
will be speaker of the house and i said kent the people 
standing here think theyre going to be president

east germans on tuesday watched on live television 
what would have been unthinkable just weeks ago members of the 
communistcontrolled parliament voting against the sole candidate 
for president 
in all 26 lawmakers voted against egon krenz while another 26 
abstained making up more than 10 percent of the 500seat peoples 
chamber 
it was the first time in the nations 40year history that the 
communist partyselected candidate for president got anything less 
than a unanimous vote and the first time such proceedings were 
broadcast live 
i always count badly joked parliament speaker horst 
sindermann as he fumbled while tallying the show of hands i 
dont want any falsified results 
while the 74yearold sindermann spoke in jest the issue is 
extremely serious for the nations growing opposition groups they 
have accused the government of rigging regional elections last 
spring 
sindermann a lifelong communist and survivor of the nazis 
notorious mauthausen concentration camp said parliament should 
ban formalism in future meetings suggesting more critical 
debate could be allowed in the chamber 
while some no votes may have been encouraged to give the 
impression the party represents a variety of opinions thereby 
diluting opposition complaints the parliament is a rubberstamp 
body tuesdays vote was a radical departure from the unanimous 
endorsements given all previous proposals by the ruling politburo 
todays voting results speak for the necessary and new 
selfconfidence of this high chamber krenz said in his speech to 
the parliament in an apparent reference to the signs of dissent 
among the ranks 
krenz reaffirmed the need for east germany to stick closely to 
its socialist foundation but also spoke of the need for 
renewal in the troubled nation 
the 52yearold east german leader also promised an 
investigation into charges of police brutality during 
demonstrations earlier this month authorities later acknowledged 
for the first time there had been police attacks against peaceful 
prodemocracy protesters 
while only time will tell whether any substantive reforms are 
undertaken there already have been plenty of changes of style 
since krenz took over the more important job as communist party 
chief a week ago 
the broadcast of the voting for president displays the 
governments attempts to show it is interested in more openness 
after decades of repression of free speech 
east german tv viewers watched pictures of a prodemocracy 
demonstration of 300000 in leipzig on monday just hours after it 
occurred the same night they were able to view the partys 
ideology chief kurt hager accuse former leader erich honecker of 
having encouraged elements of a personality cult during his 18 
years of authoritarian rule 
on saturday two senior party officials engaged in a heated 
debate with demonstrators on an east berlin street and portions of 
that exchange were broadcast on the main evening news 
the change is enormous for tv viewers accustomed to being 
flooded with government attacks on the west and official attempts 
to contradict the west german tv shows that reach most of the 
communist nation 
staterun newspapers also have been filled with growing numbers 
of critical voices ranging from workers to artists 
but while more people are being encouraged to talk openly krenz 
and his colleagues have made clear that the communist party will 
keep the leading role in the nation of 165 million people

ethnic conflicts have killed 300 civilians and 
injured 5260 since they erupted 20 months ago an interior 
ministry official said tuesday 
the conflicts have prompted 360000 people to flee their homes 
in fear including armenians azerbaijanis and meskhetian turks 
said col gen yuri v shatalin thousands of those homes have been 
set on fire he said 
the interior ministrys troops and police have suffered 890 
casualties including 12 deaths he said 
nagornokarabakh the disputed territory at the focus of the 
armeniaazerbaijan conflict remains virtually blockaded shatalin 
said 
only troop escorts permit the transport of food to the 
ethnically torn territory he said 
nagornokarabakh is a primarily armenian enclave within 
azerbaijan armenians want it transferred to armenian control and 
azerbaijanis are resisting fiercely 
azerbaijanis blockaded the republic of armenia as well this 
month but troops were able to restore train traffic on the main 
line to yerevan which runs through azerbaijan 
shatalin said the supreme soviet legislature is due to decide 
the fate of nagornokarabakh soon but he fears that any decision 
will infuriate one side or the other 
in the longrunning armeniaazerbaijan conflict shatalin said 
the death toll is almost equally divided between the two 
nationalities

us medicine has the means to prevent 10000 
infant deaths each year a bush administration official told a 
house panel tuesday but witnesses said obstacles keep many needy 
women from proper care 
the women who need early care the most can rarely fit that care 
into their lives because poverty forces them to be preoccupied with 
the struggle for personal survival witnesses told the house select 
committee on children youth and families 
women who do seek care must travel long distances changing 
buses several times for just a brief appointment witnesses said 
when one stops to consider the many problems they face 
including lack of basic necessities of life long waits in a busy 
clinic to spend a few minutes with a doctor they have never seen 
before who uses technical terms they do not understand and who 
has to hurry to see the next patient perhaps the question should 
not be why dont they but why do they said marilyn l 
poland a nurse and anthropologist on the faculty of the wayne 
state university medical school 
when they are faced with a choice between waiting for a 
welfare check to buy basic necessities before the money is stolen 
or to keep a prenatal appointment prenatal care becomes less 
important she said 
doctors on the other hand complain that they are hamstrung by 
the rise in malpractice lawsuits and insurance premiums especially 
severe among obstetricians doctors also complain that medicaid 
the stateadministered health care system for the poor is 
underfunded and caught up in red tape 
dr james o mason the acting surgeon general and assistant 
secretary for health in the department of health and human 
services said the administration is trying to tackle the worst 
problems 
we estimate that we could save 10000 of the 40000 babies who 
die each year just by applying what we already know about things 
like case management outreach and home visiting mason said 
there are 4 million babies born in the united states each year 
and the infant mortality rate the rate of infants who die within 
a year of birth ranks this country 22nd among industrialized 
nations 
for the short term mason said president bush had submitted a 
budget proposal that would expand the number of lowincome women 
eligible for medicaid 
mason said that an interdepartmental commission he chairs will 
give the white house recommendations in the next two months to 
achieve better coordination among the extensive array of existing 
programs 
among the solutions being advanced is onestop shopping in 
which health and various social services are located under one roof 
onestop shopping is based on the premise that by allowing 
eligibility for afdc welfare medicaid and other social services 
to be determined at the same time and at the same site that health 
care is delivered there will be an increased likelihood that the 
poor pregnant woman will receive the full range of services which 
she needs and to which she is entitled mason said 
other witnesses said the issue is deeper rooted and must be 
tackled in part with sex education beginning in grade school 
witnesses complained that the loss of neighborhoods and 
neighborhoodoriented medical practices along with the growth in 
government medical programs has also created a bureaucratic 
impersonal medical system

the house today moved toward passage of a 
285 billion relief plan for earthquakedamaged northern 
california after the white house announced its support for the 
package 
california lawmakers said the house bill wasnt nearly enough 
although it exceeded bush administration estimates but the white 
house said president bush would sign the bill 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
could support the 285 billion relief package approved by the 
house appropriations committee calling it pretty close to ours 
actually new federal spending would be nearly twice what the 
administration proposed the presidents budget office had said 
that about 1 billion from existing federal programs should be 
applied to quake relief so only about 15 billion in new spending 
would be needed 
we were hit by ten times the amount of explosive power of 
world war ii including the atomic bomb rep nancy pelosi 
dcalif whose district is in san francisco said as debate began 
please give us a chance to rebuild 
before voting on the spending the house voted 40118 to strike 
from the bill a provision exempting the disaster expenditures from 
the grammrudman deficit reduction law it was largely a show vote 
however as the grammrudman calculations for this year are already 
in place 
the aid package could still be modified in the senate where 
californias senators were ready to push for more money on 
wednesday the bill was expected to get speedy passage because it 
was attached to a stopgap spending bill that must be passed before 
thursday to avoid a government shutdown 
the house appropriations committee approved the aid plan monday 
and sent it to the full house for action today after rejecting the 
california delegations request for 38 billion 
the spending committee rejected 267 an amendment supported by 
the state delegation and instead favored a proposal by chairman 
jamie l whitten dmiss which essentially split the difference 
between the state and white house plans 
the committee approved 11 billion for the federal emergency 
management agency to repair the devastation and 1 billion for the 
federal highway administrations emergency fund most of the deaths 
and the worst damage from last weeks quake in the san francisco 
bay area was related to highways 
in addition 500 million would be given to the small business 
administration for emergency loans and 250 million to president 
bush to spend at his discretion on other operations 
rep vic fazio deputy chairman of the house democratic caucus 
and the california delegations point man in the committee said 
the state would keep pressing in the senate and on future 
legislation to get more aid 
certainly 28 billion is not bad he said but added it 
was only a start i dont think weve done the job yet 
fazio said he was especially concerned that the committee didnt 
waive time limits for aid requests and other federal requirements 
he said would be difficult for local authorities to meet 
the california delegation request included the 11 billion for 
fema and 1 billion for the highway emergency fund but it wanted 
12 billion for sba loans a 100 million loan fund for poor 
people and a 400 million discretionary fund for the president 
the white house by contrast said earlier that the sba should 
handle the disaster out of its existing funds sought no 
presidential fund and wanted 600 million for the federal share of 
repairing the highways in all the 25 billion administration 
proposal included just 15 billion in spending above what was 
already in the federal budget 
rep silvio conte rmass the senior republican on the 
committee and others at the committee meeting complained that the 
powerful california delegation was asking for too much too soon 
rep bob livingston rla proposed and then withdrew an 
amendment giving his home state 5 billion to compensate for all 
the hurricanes it has suffered since the turn of the century 
we are the golden state and i think there is a certain amount 
of jealousy fazio said afterward 
the californians said their estimates of the damage were more 
than 7 billion and climbing 
committee chairman whitten said he would consider a request for 
more money later 
my whole pitch is to do something now straighten it out 
later and dont waste any money in the meantime he said we 
dont attempt to put all the money in here its going to take 
the california quake came on the heels of hurricane hugo which 
devastated us islands and parts of the east coast congress is 
putting federal dollars to work on both disasters but in both cases 
is dodging its budget rules which say that the cost of new 
programs shouldnt be lopped on the federal debt 
but with bush promising to veto any new taxes and neither the 
administration nor congress offering any significant spending cuts 
the deficit is heading up again

leaders of the 49nation 
commonwealth ended a stormy weeklong summit tuesday joining the 
united states in giving south africa six months to make drastic 
changes before imposing sanctions 
but dissent by britain a major south african trade partner 
left a gaping hole in the commonwealth stance it meant the 
organization of former colonies long painfully obsessed with 
apartheid still looks less of a threat than the united states to 
the whiterun government 
spurred by what she described as a important and positive 
changes in south africa british prime minister margaret thatcher 
redoubled her lone battle against sanctions during the meeting 
the upshot was a public sparring match between mrs thatcher and 
the others led by canada and australia after she issued without 
telling them a lengthy repudiation of the summits declaration on 
south africa announced sunday 
the declaration itself which mrs thatcher signed incorporated 
her objections to key provisions 
they call for tighter financial measures immediately and 
stipulate that a ninemember foreign ministers committee will meet 
in april to gauge how far south africas new president fw de 
klerk has moved 
canada and australia the declarations main authors thought 
the dissenting note in the final text should have been enough or 
at least mrs thatcher should have told them she would be issuing a 
separate repudiation 
if we all behaved like this every commonwealth document would 
be a shambles and it wouldnt be worth very much said canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney 
we werent forewarned we were blindsided he added as the 
main antagonists let loose more recriminations at news conferences 
before heading home tuesday 
mrs thatcher countered that the others were being absolutely 
ridiculous these people who make use of free speech must 
expect others to do the same 
the commonwealth committees meeting next april is to gauge 
whether de klerk has embarked on irreversible change by that 
time 
canadian external affairs secretary joe clark the committee 
chairman said that would include drawing up legislation to repeal 
the basic tenets of apartheid that deny the black majority the vote 
and enshrine racial segregation of land 
similarly the us assistant secretary of state herman j cohen 
said this month that unless de klerk takes legislative action by 
june to end apartheid the bush administration will consider new 
measures 
the bush administration will consult with congress its european 
allies and japan about tougher sanctions if after the next 
south african parliamentary session there is very little to show 
for it cohen told the us senate foreign relations committee 
the next session of the whitedominated south african parliament 
begins in february and ends in june 
like the united states the commonwealth summit did not specify 
any new measures antiapartheid groups want coal oil and south 
africas huge diamond mining industry targeted 
the united states has already left the commonwealth well behind 
on sanctions because britain resists them and black southern 
african countries mainly commonwealth members such as zimbabwe and 
zambia depend on south africa economically 
the commonwealth in practice is in step with me in what it 
says we take a different view mrs thatcher commented in kuala 
lumpur 
under us legislation passed in 1986 after congress overrode a 
veto by thenpresident ronald reagan washington has imposed the 
strictest embargoes of any major south african trading partner 
they include bans on the imports of fruit vegetables grain 
mineral fuels uranium and radio active materials 
south africas two biggest trading partners are japan and italy 
followed by the united states west germany and britain 
a list of 11 nonbinding embargoes agreed to in 1986 by the 
commonwealth except britain included a ban on air links 
agricultural products tourist promotion and imports of uranium 
coal iron and steel 
britain imposed only a few token measures as a gesture to the 
commonwealth which south africa quit in 1961 
mrs thatcher opposes sanctions in principle saying they hurt 
blacks most and strengthen white resistance to change some 
critics particularly african nations charge she is worried about 
british investments doesnt want to lose the trade and is 
sympathetic toward pretoria

the national park service says it will not 
allow commercial timber hauling through yellowstone park despite a 
request by the us forest service 
parks director james ridenour denied the request this week on 
the advice on lawyers who said it was against federal law 
spokesman george berklacy said tuesday 
there is a park regulation that prohibits commercial transport 
across park roadways said berklacy 
ridenour also was concerned that a lumber companys plan to 
transport about 20000 truckloads of logs through the park would 
have adverse impacts on important grizzly bear elk and bison 
habitats as well as roadways said the spokesman 
he said the forest service which sold the timber indicated to 
the park service that there was an emergency need to go through 
yellowstone but berklacy said park service lawyers disagreed 
saying that the need did not meet the standards required to 
constitute an emergency 
environmentalists were waiting for ridenours decision as the 
first big test of his willingness to protect the parks from 
commercial assault 
i think the park service is to be commended michael scott 
of the wilderness society said tuesday it did the right thing 
scott said he was glad ridenour did not accept the forest 
services argument that an economic emergency existed to 
justify the hauling 
it would have set a very serious precedent said scott he 
said that if the forest service had prevailed private owners who 
were watching the action would have come forth with similar 
requests 
people expect when they enter the boundaries of yellowstone 
park that things will be different a world dominated more by 
nature than the works of civilization scott said 
the timber to be hauled is from national forests bordering 
yellowstone and amounts to about 40 million board feet from trees 
that were partially burned by fires that blazed through the park 
last year

the general who wrote the first soviet biography 
of josef stalin said tuesday there could be a return to the brutal 
dictators methods if mikhail s gorbachevs reforms dont show 
tangible results 
literally speaking i rule out a repetition of stalin 
col gen dmitri volkogonov said but a certain return to 
conservatism is not excluded of course 
volkogonov 61 appeared at a governmentsponsored news 
conference to present his fourvolume political portrait of 
stalin titled triumph and tragedy 
the book said by the official tass news agency to be the first 
soviet biography of stalin has been printed in an initial 
russianlanguage edition of 300000 copies 
volkogonovs work was 10 years in the making and he was given 
unprecedented access to previously secret archives said the 
author chief of the military history institute of the soviet 
defense ministry 
his remarks to reporters indicate his 1344page work published 
by the novosti press agency conforms to the new official view of 
stalin as a bloody tyrant instead of the former version of stalin 
as the architect of the soviet unions wartime victory over the 
nazis and the countrys industrializer 
the main thing for him was power his credo was violence 
physical and ideological volkogonov said 
in response to a reporters question he estimated that from 21 
million to 22 million soviets were unlawfully imprisoned sent into 
internal exile or wrongfully convicted during stalins 29year 
reign as soviet leader 
of that number more than twothirds perished volkognov 
said 
he said his calculations were based on the capacity of 
stalinera prisons labor camps and shooting chambers where the 
soviet secret police carried out executions 
in preparation for his book volkogonov said he met with 
hundreds of people who had known or worked with stalin among them 
former members of the ruling communist party politburo secretaries 
of the partys policymaking central committee marshals of the 
armed forces peoples commissars and members of the dictators 
entourage 
asked if another stalin could arise in the soviet union 
volkogonov said history excludes a total repetition but he 
said the apparent failure of gorbachevs reforms could trigger a 
conservative reaction 
attempts to preserve this stalinist system attempts to return 
to some of his methods are not excluded in principle volkogonov 
said to exclude them altogether we need to do a lot first of 
all our society needs like air at least some success to be felt in 
any sphere social agricultural anywhere in order to infuse 
new hope in the future success of the changes 
the soviet union also needs political mechanisms that would 
guarantee against a return to the past he said without 
elaborating 
for almost two decades volkogonov served in the main political 
department of the soviet army and navy but he said he gave that 
job up to work on the book

israeli foreign minister moshe arens has 
accepted in principle a proposal by secretary of state james a 
baker iii for palestinian negotiations but with the proviso that 
the palestine liberation organization be excluded and the agenda 
restricted the israeli embassy said tuesday 
the state department welcomed arens letter to baker and said it 
reinforces what we believe that they are engaged and that they 
are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps 
bakers fivepoint proposal is designed to attract the support 
of the arabs to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for 
elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs who live on the 
west bank and in gaza 
its key elements include assurances to israel it would have to 
be satisfied with the composition of the palestinian delegation 
and that a threeway meeting would be held in washington afterward 
the united states israel and egypt which is serving as a 
middleman to the plo would attend 
shamir while touring the golan heights called the recent 
steppedup exchange with the bush administration positive i 
dont see any large gap between our views and the proposals of the 
secretary of state he told reporters but there are some 
differences 
israels labor party opposition stressed those differences and 
threatened to protest its governments stand by staging a walkout 
in parliament i dont see anything in bakers proposal that 
needs to be changed said shimon peres the labor leader who is 
also finance minister 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said of 
arens letter delivered monday night by israeli ambassador moshe 
arad obviously it is a signal it is confirmation it is 
evidence they are taking this seriously 
she said baker had telephoned arens on tuesday while the 
foreign minister was in brussels and had also talked to egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdel meguid by phone to cairo 
he is not overly pessimistic he is not overly optimistic 
about this ms tutwiler said of baker he is very realistic 
about this 
we believe the israelis are working hard to advance this 
process and without saying they have accepted or rejected bakers 
five points it is obvious they are seriously exploring a way to 
bridge the gap to reach aqgreement on a framework she said 
asked if baker was flexible on his five points the spokeswoman 
replied jim baker is not an unreasonable person 
one of arens provisos was that baker provide assurances that 
the plo whose charter calls for dismantling the jewish state 
would not participate in the israelipalestinian talks ruth yaron 
the israeli embassy spokeswoman said 
the second she said was that the meeting be restricted to 
arrangements for the election the palestinians elected on the west 
bank and in gaza would then negotiate with israel a fiveyear plan 
for limited selfrule at the end of that trial period israel 
egypt jordan and the palestinians would work out an overall 
settlement 
shamir said israel would agree to the baker plan after the 
changes we proposed are accepted the prime minister added in 
a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not 
shamir arens and other members of the israels governing likud 
coalition have sought from the outset to preclude the talks turning 
into negotiations with the plo or turning to issues other than 
arrangements for carrying out the elections 
the plo central council meeting last week in baghdad iraq 
said only the plo could represent the palestinians and it chose a 
delegation ms tutwiler said tuesday however the plo had not 
rejected bakers five points 
while only the threeway washington meeting has been made 
public the four other points are known to provide that 
talks be held between israel and palestinians 
the meeting would concern elections 
israel is to be satisfied with the palestinian 
delegations composition 
egyptian president hosni mubarak is free to consult any middle 
eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation

a judge today sentenced actress zsa 
zsa gabor to three days in jail and ordered her to pay more than 
12000 in fines and restitution for slapping a police officer 
if you strike a cop you go to jail municipal judge charles 
rubin told miss gabor in sentencing her for battery on a police 
officer driving without a valid drivers license and having an 
open container of alcohol in her car 
rubin also fined the hungarian actress 2350 ordered her to 
pay 10000 in restitution to the city of beverly hills and its 
police department and directed her to perform 120 hours of 
community service in a shelter for homeless women 
he gave miss gabor a 24month jail sentence but suspended that 
to four days and gave her credit for the day she served after being 
arrested june 14 
the law applies equally to everybody whether theyre rich or 
poor and whether theyre famous or not the judge said ordering 
her to serve the threeday sentence before dec 29 and allowing no 
possibility of early release 
earlier rubin denied a motion by miss gabors new attorney 
harrison bull 
in setting the conditions for her community service the judge 
ordered miss gabor not to say anything to anyone about the case or 
give interviews while performing her community service and asked 
reporters to stay away from her 
as rubin lectured miss gabor about having an open bottle of 
whiskey in her rollsroyce corniche she laughed earning her a 
rebuke from the judge 
the judge said miss gabors action verbally slapped the faces 
of every cop 
she was not satisfied with that she turned around and slapped 
the face of every american by comparing justice in the united 
states to communist russia and nazi germany the judge said 
before sentencing deputy district attorney elden fox argued for 
a tough sentence 
how dare the defendant suggest that she waws not tried by a 
jury of her peers how dare she suggest they do not 
understand the class of people that she comes from fox argued 
he said miss gabors antics during trial suggested that this 
is a joke she had no respect for the process 
in his motion for a mistrial bull argued that miss gabor wasnt 
properly defended during trial by previous counsel william graysen 
but rubin ruled that graysens defense was competent and refused 
to declare a mistrial 
bull then began calling character witnesses for miss gabor 
including charity fundraiser and entertainment industry publicist 
gloria luchenbill 
miss gabor listened to witnesses with her chin thrust up and at 
one point sprayed herself with a new dose of perfume 
bull earlier called on rg markle who identified himself as an 
expert in legal ethics to back up a contention that graysen sought 
out miss gabor in order to gain favorable publicity for his law 
practice 
bull then called graysen who testified under questioning by 
bull that i took the case for several reasons and one of them 
was for the publicity graysen also said he thought the case 
would be interesting that he admired miss gabor and he believed 
there may have been some wrongdoing by police in the matter 
miss gabor arrived at court this morning in a black dress 
stepping from a black mercedes benz with her husband and telling 
about 100 reporters and camera crew members of course im 
nervous 
she explained the dress by saying my stepfather just died 
referring to her mothers third husband edmond de szigethy who 
died sept 30 
a jury on sept 29 convicted miss gabor of battery on a police 
officer driving without a valid drivers license and having an 
open container of alcohol in her car she was acquitted of failing 
to obey an officer 
the maximum possible sentence for the misdemeanor conviction was 
18 months in prison and a 3500 fine 
district attorney ira reiner urged a 30day jail sentence a 
fine of more than 3000 plus 14000 to compensate the beverly 
hills police department for its costs but fox had dismissed the 
idea of a jail term after her conviction saying she was too old to 
serve time 
i cant believe this is happening to me miss gabor who is 
secretive about her age but according to court documents is 66 
said in a telephone interview monday night im 100 percent 
innocent 
she said she spent the evening at home feeding my five dogs 
and my german husband frederick von anhalt 
we were invited to a dinner party but i cant go out ive got 
to get up early in the morning she said 
during the trial miss gabor told reporters she was afraid to go 
to jail because jails are filled with lesbians 
she later apologized saying i got letter from the lesbian 
and gay association they are going to boycott me because i say 
there are lesbians in jail imagine a womens jail there must be 
lesbians maybe i should become a lesbian what do i know i 
like men 
the threeweek trial cost 30000 fox unhappy with what he 
called a courthouse media circus had been eager to recoup 
trial expenses instead but reiner spokeswoman sandy gibbons said 
court costs could not be recouped constitutionally 
the tempestuous miss gabor slapped officer paul kramer on june 
14 after he stopped her rollsroyce convertible on a busy street 
the actress testified she instinctively struck out after kramer 
roughed her up 
kramer overreacted she said and used undue force in arresting 
her

jim bakker the television evangelist who 
lost his ptl empire in a sex and money scandal was sentenced to 45 
years in prison and fined 500000 today for a federal fraud and 
conspiracy conviction 
im deeply sorry for those i have hurt bakker said before 
he was sentenced by us district court judge robert potter i 
have sinned but never in my life did i intend to defraud 
neither side presented witnesses during the hearing which began 
at 2 pm and ended shortly after 3 pm bakker rose with his 
attorney harold bender when potter sentenced him 
bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor 
presented arguments as did his daughter tammy sue chapman 
bakkers wife tammy faye did not attend the court session 
bakker could be eligible for parole in 10 years he was 
immediately taken into custody and was to be taken to the federal 
correctional facility in talladega ala his lawyers have said 
since his conviction that they would appeal 
jessica hahn the church secretary whose sexual tryst with 
bakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose 
control of ptl in 1987 said in a television interview that she was 
not satisfied with the sentence 
in my opinion i still feel like it wont add up to the years 
that people worked to save up money to give to ptl 
bakker 49 was convicted oct 5 of 24 counts charging he 
defrauded followers of his television ministry selling lodging 
guarantees at his christian retreat when he knew rooms werent 
available 
followers sent more than 158 million to become lifetime 
partners which was supposed to give them annual lodging rights 
for the rest of their lives 
the jury found that bakker used more than 37 million to buy 
luxurious homes fancy cars jewelry and expensive vacations 
in a sentencing memo justice department fraud specialist 
deborah smith and assistant us attorney jerry miller asked potter 
that bakker be ordered to pay restitution unsettled claims total 
between 90 million to 100 million according to lawyers 
representing the partners 
prosecutors said when bakker was indicted that the maximum fine 
could be more than 5 million but when they filed the 
recommendation they cited the criminal fine enforcement act of 
1984 which allows a maximum fine to be no more than twice the 
highest fine allowed for any count in the case 
since bakker faced 21 counts carrying maximum 250000 fines and 
three carrying maximum 1000 fines the memo said the highest fine 
potter known as maximum bob for his stiff sentences could set 
was 500000 
bakker faced a maximum sentence of 120 years the memorandum did 
not specify a recommended sentence but cited a number of cases 
prosecutors said in the memo the sentence should be more than the 
longest of those cases which was 40 years 
every time there was a fork in the road and one led to a 
lighter sentence and one led to a heavier sentence jim took the 
one that led to the heavier sentence former us attorney mike 
scofield said before the sentencing when jim got on the 
courthouse steps and said he was not guilty and showed a complete 
lack of remorse and contrition thats going to hurt him that means 
a lot to judge potter 
prosecutors said a tough prison sentence would show that 
whitecollar criminals will not be dealt with less harshly than 
those criminals who have neither the wit nor the position to commit 
crimes other than those of violence 
the prosecutors said bakker has not assumed responsibility for 
his crimes 
the defendants lack of remorse suggests little potential for 
meaningful rehabilitation and demonstrates an increased likelihood 
of recidivism the prosecutors wrote since leaving ptl bakker 
has shown a willingness to continue his solicitation of support 
through the use of half truths and misrepresentations 
a substantial term of imprisonment would impress upon the 
defendant the gravity of his offenses and the need to refrain from 
similar conduct in the future the prosecutors said 
bender attached character references from bakker supporters to 
his threepage sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to 
consider alternatives to prison 
bender asked the court to temper its justice with mercy and 
consider reasonable alternatives and allow this defendant the 
benefit of the courts compassion and mercy 
during the trial which began aug 28 and lasted nearly six 
weeks defense attorneys had called 75 witnesses including more 
than 50 who were loyal bakker supporters 
prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses including many 
lifetime partners who had sent money usually 1000 to obtain 
free minivacations at ptls 2400acre christian retreat in nearby 
fort mill sc

parliament on tuesday began debating a 
bill that would end a 122yearold ban on abortions in this 
overwhelmingly roman catholic nation of 10 million people 
the issue is painful and divides us by its conflict of values 
the right to life and the distress of women said jacqueline 
mayence a conservative but proabortion senator who opened the 
debate 
nobody wants to promote abortion she said but added the 
ban is inapplicable particularly because of public opinion and 
new legislation in neighboring countries which leads to abortion 
tourism 
public opinion polls show most belgians favor abortions 
the bill before the 184member senate was preceded by 30 similar 
measures in the past 15 years that all failed to win legislative 
approval the latest would let a woman have an abortion before her 
12th week of pregnancy if she is in a state of distress 
under belgian law women who have abortions and doctors who 
perform them risk jail terms of up to 10 years yet enforcement of 
the law has been spotty and the courts have issued very lenient 
penalties to offenders in recent years 
an estimated 15000 abortions are performed in belgium each year 
with hospitals reporting these as womb surgery to allow women to be 
reimbursed by the social security system 
as debate opened senate president frank swaelen a christian 
democrat sent the bill to the council of state for a ruling on 
whether it conforms with the constitution 
the council of state a legal panel that acts as a 
constitutional court was asked to issue its ruling by weeks end 
swaelens move did not suspend the debate but it will delay a 
final senate vote until next month and reflected abortion 
opposition within prime minister wilfried martens christian 
democratic party 
the latest bill was adopted by two senate committees but has 
opened opened up a rift within martens coalition of christian 
democrats socialists and a flemish nationalist party no 
government minister attended tuesdays debate 
christian democrats especially in belgiums dutchspeaking 
northern half are almost unanimously opposed to legalizing 
abortions the socialists are in favor as are the opposition 
conservatives 
after the senate has voted on the abortion bill the issue must 
still win approval of the dominant 212member chamber of 
representatives where martens government occupies 150 seats 
the abortion debate really began 16 years ago when dr willy 
peers head of a maternity ward at a namur hospital announced he 
regularly performed abortions 
he was jailed briefly but never tried his action set off a 
proabortion campaign that led prosecutors to suspend some cases 
and judges to acquit or give light sentences to offenders who were 
prosecuted 
the parliament must thus put law in conformity with social and 
legal reality said ms mayence 
she added that the bill would not establish abortion on demand 
but permit it in certain circumstances abortions could only take 
place after the 12th week of pregnancy if the foetus suffered from 
serious incurable diseases or the life of the mother was in danger 
the bill also stipulates that abortions must only be carried out 
in approved hospitals or medical centers

afghan jets bombed central afghan 
cities and guerrilla strongholds to try to halt attacks on supply 
lines to besieged cities western diplomats said tuesday 
usbacked moslem guerrilla sources claimed that since the 
weekend 1500 soldiers and 700 armed militiamen defected to the 
selfproclaimed guerrilla government based in pakistan the report 
could not be independently confirmed 
one western diplomat speaking in islamabad on condition he not 
be identified said highaltitude cluster bombs rained down in 
recent days on villages and guerrilla positions along the logar 
road which links the capital kabul to gardez 100 miles southeast 
there were no immediate casualty reports 
diplomats said guerrillas have stopped a 200vehicle supply 
convoy on the logar road at mohammad aga 18 miles southeast of 
kabul the government convoy stuck at mohammad aga reportedly left 
the capital about two weeks ago and is headed toward the embattled 
garrison town of khost near the pakistan border 
guerrillas launched an offensive against khost more than two 
months ago but fighting is deadlocked 
a guerrilla source known only as amanullah corroborated 
reports of heavy bombing along the logar road but said about 60 
percent of the villages were already reduced to rubble in bombing 
raids during the early years of the war 
most civilians from the area moved to neighboring pakistan 
where more than 3 million refugees have fled from the decadelong 
battle between sovietbacked communist troops and the moslem 
insurgents 
diplomats quoting guerrilla sources said guerrilla fighters 
hit a government convoy traveling on the strategic salang highway 
linking kabul to the soviet union 
guerrillas claimed to have destroyed more than 20 vehicles and 
captured 30 others including tanks and armored personnel carriers 
in last weeks attack 
diplomats and rebel sources said the road between kabul and the 
eastern city of jalalabad has been blocked by guerrilla fighters 
since sept 25 the 75mile stretch of highway is critical for the 
government to resupply the beseiged city of jalalabad 
a guerrilla spokesman who uses the single name iqbal said 
1500 army troops deserted their positions in eastern afghanistans 
ghazni province on monday 
the 700 militiamen defected on the weekend from 20 outposts in

a government report showing that guns cause 11 
percent of young peoples deaths underscores the need to lower 
teenage homicide rates especially among blacks health secretary 
louis sullivan said tuesday 
since 1968 homicide has been the leading cause of death for 
black males aged 15 to 19 from 1984 to 1987 the rate for this 
group jumped 53 percent to 60 deaths per 100000 the report said 
firearms are responsible for about eight in 10 of these deaths 
the report said 
the report firearm mortality among children and youth was 
released in conjunction with the premiere of a television 
documentary on youth homicide produced by the department of health 
and human services the program is being offered to stations 
nationwide 
the statistics show that we are losing our youth not only to 
disease but increasingly to injury and violence sullivan said 
just as we have controlled so many childhood diseases we must 
now mount an equally aggressive campaign to rid our childrens 
lives of the causes and tools of injury and violence the 
secretary said in a statement accompanying the report 
the report by the national center for health statistics counted 
3392 firearmrelated deaths among children aged 1 to 19 in 1987 
about 11 percent of all childhood deaths 
among children aged 1 to 4 guns accounted for about 1 percent 
of deaths but the proportion rose to 17 percent among teenagers 
the report said 
for children aged 1 to 9 homicide and unintentional shooting 
deaths each accounted for about half of all firearm deaths among 
those aged 10 to 14 shooting deaths were about equally divided 
among suicide homicide and unintentional shootings 
of the firearm deaths among teenagers about 48 percent were 
homicides 42 percnt were suicides and 8 percent were unintentional 
shootings 
teenage boys are six times as likely as teenage girls to die 
in a shooting the report said 
among black teenagers 41 percent of deaths are associated with 
firearms compared with 16 percent for white male teenagers 
the frequency of firearmrelated deaths in the united states 
changed little from 1968 to 1987 except among teenagers for whom 
the death rate over the period rose from 10 per 100000 to nearly 
15 per 100000 
the overall rate decreased for children aged 1 to 4 during the 
period

a warsaw priest plans to hold religious 
ceremonies for up to 3000 people who were murdered by secret 
police during the stalinist era and buried near his church 
these people were deprived of a christian burial therefore 
the warsaw church has a totally special obligation to fulfill this 
funeral ritual the rev jozef r maj parish priest at st 
catherines church told state television monday 
he said lectures and ceremonies would be held thursday through 
saturday with a funeral service saturday night 
he also appealed to people to provide any information they have 
that could broaden our knowledge about the poles killed as 
communism was imposed throughout the country 
a cleaning last fall of the archives of the roman catholic 
church revealed that 500 to 3000 people slain by polish secret 
police from 1946 to 1956 were buried in the parish cemetery the 
television report said 
the examination of the church archives was reported in the 
polish press last year but at that time the stalinist repression 
in poland after world war ii was a taboo subject for the official 
media 
the existence of a mass grave in the sluzewiec cemetery had been 
known for years even though the victims were buried secretly names 
of the victims have not been released by the interior ministry and 
many have not been identified 
thousands of poles who were accused of resisting communist rule 
were arrested held without trial tortured and killed as soviet 
dictator josef stalin enforced his domination over eastbloc 
countries controlled by the soviet army 
among those slain were members of the underground home army that 
had fought the nazis and was under the command of the polish 
governmentinexile in london stalin broke relations with the 
governmentinexile in 1943 
the television news commentator said it is probable that among 
the victims buried in the cemetery are a home army general and a 
group of teenage boy scouts who fought in the warsaw uprising 
against the nazis in the closing days of world war ii 
the commentator said it had been determined that the youngest 
person buried in the parish cemetery was 17 years old

the 65 mph speed limit may have killed 600 
people on rural interstates some due to a sharp increase in 
drivers in some states who travel at extremely high speeds 
according to a government report 
the national highway traffic safety administrations report to 
congress said states with the higher speed limit on rural freeways 
for two years showed an estimated 31 percent increase in fatalities 
on those roads 
the report dated monday estimated that 309 more people died in 
1987 and 591 in 1988 than would have been expected based on the 
historical trend before congress allowed the higher speed limit 
about twothirds of the increase 600 deaths could be attributed 
to speed the report said and the remainder to increased traffic 
results varied widely from state to state however and the 
report said the number of deaths was so low in some cases that the 
changes were not statistically significant in vermont for 
example fatalities on rural interstates increased 800 percent 
from 2 in 1986 to 18 in 1988 but the report said that could have 
been due to chance or factors other than speed 
in 17 states death tolls on affected highways were 50 percent 
or more higher than in 1986 when the speed limit was 55 mph said 
the report 
on the other hand six states with 65 mph limits showed 
decreases in fatalities on rural interstates and the eight states 
that retained the 55 mph limit averaged a 10 percent increase in 
fatalities on such roads over the two years 
speed monitoring data from 18 of the states that increased the 
speed limit showed that 11 times as many vehicles were traveling 
faster than 80 miles per hour than two years ago three times as 
many were traveling faster than 70 mph the report said 
the agency earlier concluded that the 55 mph limit dramatically 
curtailed the number of drivers using excessive speed and even 
lowered average speeds on some roads posted below 55 mph 
the gap between the speeds of the slowest and fastest traffic on 
the road also increased on roads posted at 65 mph the new report 
said 
the effects of these two changes were to increase the 
likelihood and severity of traffic collisions the report said 
the agency made no recommendation on the speed limit noting 
that the transportation department continues to believe that 
states are in the best position to make decisions on both posted 
speed limits and enforcement 
brian oneill president of the insurance institute for highway 
safety said the government report confirms data it compiled 
earlier 
there shouldnt be a question any longer deaths have 
increased because of higher speed limits oneill said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner sent a letter last month 
to all governors calling for a national campaign to discourage 
speeding but said states could determine appropriate speed limits 
the report said that despite the increase on rural highways 
interstates remain the safest highways in the country with fewer 
fatalities for the miles traveled than other roads accidents on 
rural interstates killed 2836 people in 1988 or about 6 percent 
of the 47079 fatalities on us roads 
overall fatalities were up 15 percent on all roads but the 
number of deaths per 100000 miles traveled remained at the 1987 
level of 24 which is an alltime low 
the country has 29808 miles of interstate highway on which the 
speed limit has been increased to 65 mph 
states which have retained the 55 mph limit are connecticut 
hawaii maryland massachusetts new jersey new york 
pennsylvania and rhode island alaska and delaware have no rural 
interstates

the soviet foreign minister pledged 
tuesday on his first visit to the new solidarity government to 
maintain key fuel supplies and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
said he will travel next month to moscow 
in addition foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the 
soviet union will try to uncover the truth about the world war ii 
massacre of thousands of polish officers at katyn the issue has 
long been a sore point in polishsoviet relations 
upon arrival at warsaws okecie airport shevardnadze said 
the soviet leadership places a lot of importance on his visit 
to warsaw 
he was met by polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski a 
professor of international law and solidarity sympathizer who told 
shevardnadze this is an important visit for us we have high 
expectations for it 
they held two rounds of talks before shevardnadze went to the 
council of ministers to meet mazowiecki a former solidarity editor 
who became the first noncommunist to lead an east bloc government 
on aug 24 
i am very happy about our manyfaceted talk mazowiecki said 
after his twohour meeting with shevardnadze i accepted the 
invitation to moscow with gratitude and said he expected to 
leave for the soviet union on nov 23 
polish officials say the important items on the agenda with the 
soviet union were restructuring economic relations between warsaw 
and moscow as part of a drive to create a market economy 
resolution of historical blank spots and easing of contacts 
between polish and soviet citizens 
there are some problems but they were discussed in the spirit 
of understanding and seeking solutions foreign ministry 
spokesman stefan staniszewski said after the meeting which he said 
focused on economic problems and new forms of cooperation 
shevardnadze will meet with polish officials again wednesday 
before holding discussions thursday and friday in warsaw with 
warsaw pact foreign ministers 
according to staniszewski shevardnadze pledged the soviet union 
would maintain its level of deliveries to poland which is 
dependent on moscow for oil gas electricity and raw materials 
it was a significant gesture of good will because poland has 
been having trouble delivering products to the soviet union due to 
its protracted economic crisis which includes a shotage of 
industrial goods high inflation and a 39 billion foreign debt 
poland has said it wants to renegotiate its contracts with its 
trading partners in the sovietled comecon alliance to make them 
more marketoriented 
shevardnadze is the highestranking soviet official to visit 
warsaw since mazowieckis election two days after mazowiecki took 
office kgb chief viktor kryuchkov met with him and called him a 
solid man 
the soviet decision not to interfere in the assumption of power 
by a solidarity government relayed by president mikhail s 
gorbachev in a telephone call to polish communist first secretary 
mieczyslaw f rakowski on aug 22 marked a significant departure 
from soviet treatment of its east bloc allies 
shevardnadze underlined this point monday in a major foreign 
policy speech in moscow saying that as warsaw pact countries move 
away from oneparty rule the soviet union would observe principles 
of nonintervention and absolute freedom of choice 
poland the soviet unions largest trade partner and hungary 
have led the way in implementing democratic reform in the east bloc 
but mazowiecki and his solidarityled cabinet have promised to 
respect the countrys military obligations to the sovietled 
alliance 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said last week 
poland was preparing a visit by mazowiecki to moscow to discuss 
economic relations polishsoviet history and expanding 
peopletopeople contacts 
central among the historical issues is the katyn massacre of 
4300 polish officers on soviet soil in world war ii 
speaking to reporters tuesday shevardnadze was asked if they 
had discussed the issue 
all questions everything connected with history present and 
future were raised he replied we are going to study history 
and search for documents if they exist 
i state this with full responsibility we are interested in 
the truth 
poland has been pressing for a joint declaration of soviet 
responsibility for the deaths of 15000 officers at katyn and two 
other world war ii camps but there has been reluctance on the part 
of hardline factions in the soviet union 
poland also is interested in increasing contact between soviet 
citizens and poles staniszewski said shevardnadze saw no great 
difficulties in resolving problems of poles living in the soviet 
union and the care of polish monuments and places of national 
remembrance on soviet territory

officials at a high school here reinstated a 
25yearold fight chant one month after it was shelved when a 
student complained that it contained a subliminal salute to the ku 
klux klan 
to say that an innocent cadence which happens to have a 
kkk in it is racist is stretching things a little bit said 
chic renner school board president on tuesday 
a student complained on sept 18 about the traditional chant at 
pekin high school superintendant jack wilt agreed and ordered 
changes in the final line of the chant pppek kkkin 
pek kin pekin pekin pekin 
the new lyrics spelled out dragon the school mascot but 
officials said fans found the chant awkward 
wilt said he and principal bill rees reconsidered the issue last 
thursday and decided they had gone too far in ordering it 
rewritten 
i thought the original decision was correct but it seemed 
rees and i were the only ones who thought so wilt said some 
people felt that maybe we had overreacted 
wilt said tuesday he still believes the pekin chant with 
its repetition of kkk contains a racist overtone if viewed 
in a narrow context 
but we decided that no racism was intended and that maybe we 
overreacted so we changed it back wilt said i hope this is 
the end of it 
pekin is sensitive to the racism issue after allegations that 
black students from peoria and champaign were harassed by students 
from the predominantly white pekin high school twice in the 198889 
school year

the united states is proceeding with proposals 
to liberalize world agricultural trade including a fiveyear 
phasing out of export subsidies the bush administration said 
tuesday 
eventually perhaps within a decade the plan also calls for the 
elimination of domestic programs that distort international trade 
in farm commodities 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the detailed 
plan which will be presented formally wednesday in geneva to the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade would not get rid of all 
government farm aid 
there is nothing here that precludes any nation from having a 
safety net for its farmers he said 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said us agricultural policy will not be made in 
geneva or some foreign capital it will be made by congress which 
must approve any final gatt agreement before it can become law in 
this country 
leahy added in a statement i will not abandon our farmers to 
unfair competition i will also not allow the administration to 
abandon them either 
the current round of talks under the 97nation gatt began in 
punta del esta uruguay on sept 20 1986 and will conclude at 
the end of 1990 
yeutter who joined us trade representative carla hills at a 
news conference said the plan now going before gatt is not much 
different from the initial us proposal made in 1987 although it 
is much more comprehensive much more specific than the earlier 
plan 
hills said the agriculture proposal would mean that americas 
farmers could compete against foreign farmers based on price and 
quality rather than on the depth of a foreign governments 
pocketbook or the height of a trade barrier 
the us objective in the gatt talks has been to gain improved 
market access for american goods and services including major farm 
commodities such as grain oilseeds cotton and livestock products 
yeutter said the us proposal calls for gradually scaling down 
or eliminating quotas and other nontariff barriers by converting 
them into tariffs over 10 years 
he said safeguards would be allowed for temporary protection 
against countries dumping their goods selling them below 
production cost 
export subsidies would be phased out over five years yeutter 
said the export subsidies maintained by the european economic 
community have been a sore point with us trade officials for years 
under the proposal some domestic subsidies would have a red 
light designation and be eliminated gradually those with a 
yellow light designation would be watched for possible further 
negotiation and those with green light designation such as 
conservation programs would proceed 
yeutter stressed that no move would be made unilaterally by the 
united states and that no farm program would be altered unless 
other countries did likewise 
if we travel down this correct road we will travel it only in 
conjunction with our trading partners he said whether or not 
we do so is now up to them 
yeutter said he doubted if the gatt proposal would significantly 
alter the debate in congress on new farm legislation due next year 
he said he hoped that the 1990 farm legislation will become law 
before the uruguay round of trade talks conclude 
assuming the trade negotiations are successful he said we 
will make modifications in that farm legislation in 1991 
leland swenson president of the national farmers union said 
his organization has some real concerns about the us 
proposal particularly in the interpretation of 
tradedistorting subsidies 
we see encompassed within there a call to eliminate domestic 
farm programs and farm policy swenson said in a telephone 
interview 
but swenson added that the union has supported the strengthening 
of trade rules in regard to direct export subsidies and that these 
could be reduced or eliminated so long as other countries did 
likewise 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said the united states holds an advantage by being first in line at 
gatt with its proposals 
were going to again set the tone for this he said so 
ours will be the one thats under discussion 
kleckner said the farm bureau believes that the thrust of this 
proposal is correct

frances first lady danielle mitterrand on 
tuesday brought an impassioned appeal to congress to help save the 
kurdish people from annihilation 
do not forget them silence is killing them she told the 
gongressional human rights caucus 
they are all individuals in distress and their people is in 
danger of extinction mrs mitterrand said several kurdish women 
in the packed hearing room wept during her speech 
there are an estimated 20 million kurds scattered among turkey 
iraq iran syria lebanon and the soviet union they have been 
subjected to persecution in all these countries especially in iraq 
which is strongly believed to have bombarded them with poison gas 
last year 
iraq has denied the accusation but one of three american 
physicians who visited kurdish refugees from iraq in turkish camps 
told the caucus his team found conclusive evidence of poison gas 
symptoms robert mullen cookdeegan said refugees described eye 
lung and gastrointestinal irritation consistent with the known 
effects of poison gas 
mrs mitterrand a noted human rights activist who cosponsored 
the first international forum on the plight of the kurds last week 
in paris described her visit last may to the same turkish camps 
the physicians visited 
without directly criticizing iraq which is one of frances 
biggest weapons clients mrs mitterrand said the kurdish refugees 
clearly do not believe assurances by the iraqi government that they 
can return home without fear of persecution 
the result is that the iraqi kurds in turkey are in a 
desperate situation they can neither go home which is their 
deepest wish nor become integrated into the kurdish population in 
turkey she said 
mrs mitterrand said she visited the camps despite attempts by 
turkish authorities to dissuade her and encountered dreadful 
living conditions at the barbedwire enclosures where more than 
30000 kurdish refugees are incarcerated 
the only help can come from the worlds democratic governments 
she said 
members of the caucus said congress had ignored the kurdish 
tragedy for too long this is one of the most flagrant examples 
of mans inhumanity to man said sen edward kennedy dmass 
the brutal iraqi campaign to eradicate the kurds must be 
condemned he said more than 60000 kurds fled the iraqi attacks 
and we must act now to ensure it never never happens again

democratic mayoral candidate david dinkins 
commanding lead in the polls over republican rudolph giuliani has 
shrunk in the aftermath of questions about his financial dealings 
a new poll indicates 
dinkins who led giuliani less than two weeks ago by about 20 
percent was picked by 45 percent compared with 41 percent for 
giuliani in the poll conducted for the new york daily news and 
wabctv 
the poll of 500 voters conducted sunday had a margin of error 
of 5 percentage points 
the poll was the first since the sept 12 democratic primary to 
show dinkins support at less than 50 percent 
the daily newswabc poll indicated the biggest shift in support 
occurred among jewish voters who last week favored dinkins by 10 
points 
now 44 percent of jewish voters support giuliani and 26 percent 
support dinkins according to the poll twentysix percent were 
undecided and 69 percent were not strongly committed to either 
candidate 
dinkins on monday compared the new poll results to those done 
shortly before the democratic primary that suggested that mayor 
edward koch and i were neck and neck we of course were not and 
the outcome was not what they predicted 
i suspect thats the case here he said 
however dinkins said he had anticipated there would be some 
falloff in support among all voters due to the recent 
controversy over his finances 
political analysts have said dinkins loss of support may be due 
to questions about his finances including his failure to pay taxes 
from 1969 to 1973 and discrepancies in the stated value of stock he 
transferred to his son 
dinkins has denied any wrongdoing 
giuliani said the poll results confirm what ive been seeing 
in the streets in the last three or four weeks 
he said voters want fundamental change they want honest 
reformed government i think they realize that david dinkins 
isnt up to the task of being mayor

the energy department acknowledged tuesday it 
may have erred in rewarding the private operators of several of its 
nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite 
serious failings to protect the health and safety of workers and 
nearby residents 
the admission came from henson moore the deputy energy 
secretary and other department officials during a grilling by a 
house government operations subcommittee which documented the 
bonus payments to operators of the rocky flats plutonium processing 
plant and the savannah river nuclear production center 
savannah river the nations only source of tritium used to make 
nuclear warheads has been closed for more than a year because of 
safety and technical problems that prompted the department to 
switch management companies there last april 
the rocky flats plant situated about 16 miles from denver is 
in disarray and is under fbi investigation for possible criminal 
violation of environmental laws 
there is room for real question about whether the energy 
department should have paid 912000 in bonuses last year to the 
top 25 ei du pont de nemours amp co managers of the savannah river 
plant near aiken sc moore said in sworn testimony 
he acknowledged that the three highestpaid du pont executives 
with collective government salaries of 561000 and bonuses of 
306000 in 1988 were not based at the plant site they worked at 
du pont headquarters at wilmington del 
separately government auditors disclosed tuesday that du pont 
on sept 27 1988 told the energy department that some of the 
reactor fuel and targets used to produce tritium at savannah 
river were defective and that others might be defective as well 
the department immediately ordered du pont to stop making the fuel 
and targets and to investigate whether the problem might 
jeoparidize safety 
several months later it was decided there was no safety problem 
but the energy department did not approve a plan for improving 
manufacturing of the fuel and targets until earlier this month the 
general accounting office said in a report to congress 
replacing the defective and suspect materials will cost at least 
731000 and possibly an additional 8 million depending on how 
the problem is resolved the gao said 
over the objections of the energy departments legal staff rep 
mike synar dokla chairman of the house subcommittee released 
figures on salaries and bonuses paid to du pont executives in each 
of the past five years in what synar called a compromise with the 
department the subcommittee withheld the names and job titles of 
the du pont managers 
moore said that to release the managers names would unfairly 
subject them to public abuse 
from 1984 through 1988 the top 25 du pont executives in charge 
of running savannah river got 127 million in salaries plus 35 
million in performance bonuses from the energy department the 
figures showed 
westinghouse savannah river co took over as operator at the 
plant last april 1 moore told the committee that the top 
westinghouse executives are paid less than the du pont managers 
were and that all top westinghouse managers are stationed at the 
plant moore did not provide exact figures for westhinghouse 
salaries or bonuses 
synar also questioned why the department paid rockwell 
international corp 268 million in bonus money in the 198688 
fiscal years for running rocky flats in a period when the plant was 
cited for numerous flaws in safety and health protection 
the gao in a separate report released at the subcommitee 
hearing said the department in its ratings used to set rockwells 
semiannual bonus awards deliberately played down or ignored 
negative information about the companys performance 
bruce twining who headed the energy department regional office 
in albuquerque nm that approved the bonus payments to rockwell 
admitted under questioning from synar that the department probably 
went too easy on rockwell 
looking back from today those ratings could clearly be 
questioned twining said 
rockwell announced last month that it was withdrawing from its 
rocky flats contract next january because of a disagreement with 
the energy department over the companys potential liability for 
environmental violations at the plant 
moore disclosed that egampg inc which will take over as operator 
of rocky flats when rockwell leaves will be paid 15 million in 
advance for one years work after the first year its earnings 
will be pegged to performance ratings by the department he said

while fires caused the major devastation 
from the 1906 earthquake lessons learned then helped the san 
francisco fire department reduce losses from last weeks temblor 
fire chief frederick postel said tuesday 
firefighters strapped for equipment also pulled two trucks out 
of a city museum and pressed them into service and a controversial 
and expensive fire boat maintained by the city proved its value 
postel told members of the city fire commission in a preliminary 
report 
but perhaps the most important development was the creation 
years ago of a special water main system that allowed broken areas 
to be quickly sealed off and the water diverted 
with no water available in 1906 firefighters watched helplessly 
as flames consumed thousands of buildings only a handful were 
destroyed by fire in last weeks quake fire officials said 
in 1906 there was no water for four days postel said we 
didnt have water for 1 to 2 hours 
thats a credit to our forefathers from the last quake 
postel said 
postel said there were just 14 breaks in water mains caused by 
the oct 17 quake the 1906 quake caused 300 breaks 
but the breaks were critical in the hardhit marina district of 
san francisco where fires broke out and there was no water to 
fight them 
it was rolling said firefighter bob mielke it was going 
to take off on the whole area 
firefighters ran a hose into a pond at the nearby palace of fine 
arts and also pumped out of the bay with the fire boat phoenix to 
douse the flames postel said 
that was what in the fire service is called a miraculous 
stop postel said 
the fire boat had recently been the target of city budget cuts 
but was saved at the last minute 
in the first hours after the quake firefighters responded to 
400 calls for assistance including 27 fires postel said on an 
average day there are 159 calls for help 
a total of 2000 calls for help were received in the first 80 
hours 300 percent above normal he said 
ninety percent of the calls the first day were gas leaks he 
said while others were to rescue people trapped in buildings and 
elevators and inspect buildings 
with so much demand equipment ran short and ingenious 
firefighters took equipment out of the citys fire museum postel 
said 
one engine was a 1961 model that was the only jet turbine water 
pumper ever built said susan stacks a museum trustee 
the jet turbine built by planemaker the boeing co was not a 
successful experiment and had been removed from the truck she 
said but because it was the only one ever built the truck was 
placed in the museum 
mielke said the old truck was used to answer about 15 calls in 
his area while regular engines raced to the marina district 
firefighters refitted the old truck with pumping equipment it 
was missing fittings and certain things like that but it worked 
fine he said 
also used was a 1937 foam truck that is normally only taken out 
in parades ms stacks said the truck was used to transport 
firefighters she said 
postel said 400 offduty firefighters rushed back to work in san 
francisco while others were unable to reach the city because of 
traffic congestion and ruined roads 
there has been criticism of the departments reduced manpower 
and defective equipment only about 1325 of 1500 authorized 
firefighting poisitions are filled postel said and the department 
suffers from a shortage of highrise firefighting equipment and 
reserve equipment 
but postel said he was satisfied with the departments 
performance he could not estimate how many firefighters responded 
in total

body number five female wearing blue jeans gold cap on the 
third premolar said a broadcast from the morgue by radio hrn 
body number 10 male 175 meters tall green shirt partial 
dentures in upper jaw the report said 
body number 79 male apparentlyfrom costa rica blue pants 
sweatshirt with the letter b the body has no head 
hundreds of people fearing relatives or friends perished in 
crash have gone to the morgue and some have been able to assist in 
the identifications 
the easy ones are identified first its a slow process 
said us embassy spokesman terry kneebone he said 12 americans 
are presumed dead but he could not say which bodies had been 
identified because of privacy act considerations 
three americans the pilot copilot and two flight attendants 
were among the 15 survivors 
the pilot was severely injured and investigators have been 
unable to question him 
copilot reiniero canales said in a radio interview monday that 
the flight was normal unril suddenly we hit something it was all 
so fast we didnt have time to react the jetliner was 1800 feet 
below its assigned flight path when it crashed into a mountain 
cerro de hule about 6 miles south of the tegucigalpa runway 
some investigators were considering air turbulence as the cause 
with two theories one focused on an atmospheric phenomenon called 
a rolling wave that would create a violent downdraft and the 
other involved wind pressure created by a valley near the peak and 
a low pressure zone behind the peak 
we havent definitively ruled anything out yet said barry 
trotter head of a us national transportation safety board team 
assisting the honduran government 
bodies of 23 of the 67 nicaraguan victims were flown tuesday to 
managua president daniel ortega and about 500 relatives and 
friends of the victims were at the airport 
the transfer had been planned for monday but was delayed because 
of preparation of the bodies and a shortage of metal caskets in 
honduras according to daniel abud a nicaraguan foreign ministry 
official in managua 
ortega said the problems could have been overcome if there 
were a little more willingness on the part of honduras 
relations between nicaragua and honduras have been tense since 
nicaraguas leftwing sandinistas came to power in 1979 
overthrowing conservative president anastasio somoza 
ortega said honduran president jose azcona hoyo had called him 
to offer condolences and apologize for the difficulties

the pentagon announced on tuesday it granted a 
sixmonth extension for early design work on the advanced tactical 
fighter a program that has come under fire from house lawmakers 
while pentagon and air force officials said they were unable to 
determine an exact cost for the delay one report put it between 
250 million and 500 million 
the fighter informally known as the atf is slated to be the 
nextgeneration aircraft that will succeed the air forces f15 and 
the navys f14d tomcat fighter 
two design teams are competing to build the aircraft northrop 
and mcdonnell douglas are building a prototype design known as 
yf23 while lockheed boeing and general dynamics are constructing 
a prototype known as the yf22 
congressional sources who spoke on condition of not being 
identified by name said the delay was sought because the lockheed 
team was not as far along as the northropled group 
the source said the delay also gives the acquisition people in 
dod more time to obtain more detailed test data and to decide 
which version of the plane they want 
john betti the undersecretary of defense for acquisition 
informed the air force and the navy last wednesday that a sixmonth 
extension had been approved by the defense aquisition board the 
pentagons top procurment panel the pentagon said in a brief 
statement 
the extension has been granted for the phase formally known as 
the demonstrationvalidation phase 
air force spokeswoman capt robin crumm said the delay is 
designed to reduce the technical risk and cost uncertainties of 
the program 
a report in defense news which cited unnamed defense department 
and industry sources said the cost of the anticipated contract 
changes ranged from 250 million to 500 million 
the report said air force officials expect to take the money 
from funds earmarked for the planes fullscale development phase 
crumm said she could not comment on the report 
with the additional sixmonth delay fullscale development of 
the plane is not expected to begin before mid1991 
the lastest change follows a decision in january to lengthen the 
fullscale development time for the plane from 23 months to 36 
months that is the time from when the contract is awarded until 
the first flight of the plane is anticipated 
in september the house armed services committee noted that the 
cost of research and development of the atf program has increased 
by 900 million to 135 billion over the past six months 
the problems prompted the house in its appropriations bill to 
eliminate the 11 billion for the air forces fighter and 65 
million for the navys version in the fiscal 1990 budget 
the action by the house was considered a proverbial shot across 
the bow with members saying they expected the funding to be 
restored once the final defense appropriations bill was passed

former labor secretary william j usery jr 
has been picked to mediate the sixmonth dispute between the united 
mine workers and the pittston coal group sources said tuesday 
current labor secretary elizabeth dole is to formally announce 
her choice wednesday but aides declined comment tuesday on whom it 
might be 
two sources familiar with the decision speaking on the 
condition they not be identified said that usery who in the past 
quarter century has helped settle dozens of bitter strikes was 
doles choice as supermediator for the coal strike which began 
april 5 and has idled 1700 miners in three states 
mrs dole visited a pittston facility in carbo va earlier 
this month and days later met with umw president richard trumka and 
pittston co chairman paul douglas after that session she 
announced plans to name an outside mediator 
usery who was labor secretary in the ford administration since 
leaving government has headed a labor relations consulting firm in 
washington he was out of town tuesday but was scheduled to return 
tuesday night his secretary said 
there have been some talks involving the union and pittston but 
only with federal mediators shuttling messages back and forth to 
the separate rooms of union and company negotiators 
the major issue in the strike which affects pittston mines in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky is health and retirement 
benefits pittston withdrew last year from the bituminous coal 
operators association the national bargaining arm of most coal 
companies because it said the group had given the miners too much 
medical coverage in its contract particularly for pensioners 
as labor secretary usery sometimes stepped into contract 
disputes but mrs dole has resisted such tactics in favor of 
outside mediators 
i am not a mediator she said during her visit to the 
pittston facility im not here to say i have the answer to this 
complex problem but i do feel now it is time to see if we can 
facilitate the bargaining process 
in selecting usery mrs dole turned to a man with an impressive 
and lengthy resume as a mediator 
in 1987 he was credited with forging a settlement to a sixmonth 
strike by the united auto workers against the deere amp co four 
years earlier chicago mayor harold washington called usery a 
genius after he brought an end to a threeweek strike by the citys 
teachers their longest ever in just 24 hours he also helped 
settle a professional football strike in 1974 and has mediated 
dozens of other disputes in the rubber auto electric hotel 
transportation and other industries 
usery a native of hardwick ga was brought to washington in 
1969 by thenpresident nixon and named assistant secretary of 
labor he quickly was credited with helping settle railroad and 
airline labor disputes in 1973 he was named director of the 
federal mediation and conciliation service and served in that post 
for three years until ford tapped him to head the labor department

prime minister rajiv gandhi on tuesday 
flew by helicopter to the countrys most densely populated voter 
belt and filed the papers that formally launch his quest for 
reelection 
the 45yearold gandhi who pledged to uphold the constitution 
after paying a 30 election filing fee was then driven through 
sultanpur a town of 100000 in the northern state of uttar 
pradesh he was greeted by about 2000 spectators 
political analysts say next months parliamentary election could 
be the closest in indias 42 years of independence 
gandhi appearing in public for the first time since new 
elections were announced a week ago professed confidence his party 
would return to power in the balloting for the lower house of 
parliament set for nov 22 24 and 26 
the people are going to help us win the election said 
gandhi who was filing in the amethi constituency that he has 
represented since 1981 
so far there has been no indication of who the opposition will 
chose to oppose gandhi in this constituency there has been 
speculation the prime minister might face vishwanath pratap singh 
a former ally now leading the national front opposition coalition 
i would welcome this gandhi told reporters but he would 
lose 
a month ago a unified opposition seemed possible as hindu 
activists joined communists in antigovernment protests 
but recent outbreaks of hindumoslem violence around india have 
led the communists and some centrists to question the viability of 
a broad opposition alliance at least 79 people have died in 
hindumoslem clashes since august including 23 last month in uttar 
pradesh 
the prospects of gandhis party are uncertain the prime 
minister has been haunted for more than two years by charges of 
high level corruption in his government 
singh often perceived as wishywashy in his efforts to unite 
opposition parties is campaigning as mr clean just as gandhi 
himself did five years ago 
the 58yearold singh who once served as defense and finance 
ministers in gandhis cabinet has seized on indian newspaper 
reports that swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid up to 50 
million in kickbacks to secure a 1986 contract to deliver 14 
billion worth of artillery guns to india 
gandhi has repeatedly denied the reports 
waiting for gandhi on tuesday a score of men chanted that they 
would vote for congress party 
however bahadur singh a university student interrupted the 
chorus we are free to cast our vote not necessarily for rajiv 
gandhi he said 
other spectators said they would vote for the national front 
we like vp singh because he is an honest person said 
20yearold girish kumar another spectator 
with more than 79 million eligible voters uttar pradesh 
controls 85 seats in the lok sabha the lower policymaking house 
of parliament more than any of the other 24 states 
this year under a constitutional amendment initiated by gandhi 
18 to 20yearolds can vote in the national election for the first 
time they comprise 7 percent of the electorate of 500 million 
indians will vote in 542 constituencies

private insurance and health care should be 
opened up to more people through a system of legal requirements and 
increased taxes state and congressional officials said tuesday 
although we may not be able to provide universal health care 
in our country at this time we ought to provide universal access 
to health insurance in the private sector said rep doug walgren 
dpa 
rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the house select 
committee on aging proposed a rearrangement of present plans 
to place the burdens on all americans in his testimony at a 
hearing of the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health 
care 
we must be able to expand the cigarette tax walgren said 
explaining that surveys show americans are willing to pay increased 
taxes to solve pressing national and ethical problems such as 
health care 
walgren a member of the house energey and commerce subcommittee 
on health and environment complained that health insurers want to 
provide coverage only to the healthy leaving 20 percent of all 
applicants for private insurance without adequate coverage because 
of exclusions or aboveaverage premiums for preexisting medical 
conditions 
he has introduced legislation to prohibit private insurers from 
denying coverage in such situations 
expansion of the payroll tax increased estate and gift taxes 
and universal mandatory health insurance are solutions to the 
nations health care crisis said barbara matula north carolinas 
medicaid director 
we are mandated to have car insurance and fire insurance we 
can be mandated to pay health insurance said matula who 
represented the american public welfare association at tuesdays 
hearing 
business representatives argued mandated benefits would increase 
costs and threaten the viability of small businesses that employ 
most new american workers 
but matula insisted workers and employers not be allowed to opt 
out of paying health insurance premiums because they would provide 
funding for coverage for themselves their families and the 
unemployed 
while not offering specific strategies or solutions melvin 
glasser director of the committee for national health insurance a 
20yearold coalition of about 40 individuals and labor leaders 
pleaded with the commission not to try again to resort to 
piecemeal patchwork methods like the catastrophic health care 
program 
the house repealed the program outright and the senate 
drastically cut its funding the differences among lawmakers are 
being worked out by a budget conference committee 
the 15member panel known as the pepper commission for the late 
florida congressman who was its first chairman and creator was 
born in the catastrophic care law it is to submit to congress a 
proposal for health care reforms entailing what benefits to provide 
to whom and how to pay for them 
there are an estimated 31 million people who have no health 
insurance more than 9 million americans who need longterm care 
and 135 million underinsured who can not get adequate health care 
because of financial constraints 
the commission is scheduled to hold at least one additional 
hearing before making its final report to congress by march 1 1990

acting just a week after the nations most 
costly natural disaster the house on tuesday voted to speed 285 
billion in earthquakerelief aid to northern california 
state lawmakers said more money would be needed later to finish 
the job 
the house approved the appropriation by a vote of 32199 the 
senate is expected to concur wednesday and send the legislation to 
president bush whose spokesman indicated he would sign the bill 
we were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of world 
war ii including the atomic bomb rep nancy pelosi dcalif 
told her colleagues before the vote 
please give us a chance to rebuild said pelosi who 
represents san franciscos heavily damaged marina district 
rep vic fazio dcalif leading his states efforts to garner 
federal assistance said that with the house vote were off to a 
good start 
but he noted that the 285 billion was less than the states 
delegation had sought and said efforts would be made to increase 
the relief fund when the bill reaches the senate or in future 
legislation 
californias two senators working with the senates leaders 
hoped to pave the way for more assistance when their chamber 
debates the measure wednesday 
sens alan cranston a democrat and pete wilson a republican 
said they would seek authority for an additional 600 million for 
small business aid that money would need subsequent legislation to 
be appropriated 
the senators said they would also seek several amendments easing 
federal restrictions such as one making the damaged bay bridge 
ineligible for federal aid because it is a toll facility 
still the 285 billion package would be the largest single 
congressional disasterrelief appropriation ever dwarfing the 11 
billion approved just last month for the victims of hurricane hugo 
the 285 billion is a compromise between the 38 billion 
california representatives had sought and the 25 billion the bush 
administration had proposed presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the administration supported the compromise because 
it was pretty close to ours 
here is how the 285 billion would be allocated 
11 billion would go to the federal emergency management 
agency to aid victims and local governments get back on their feet 
1 billion would go for bridge and highway repairs 
500 million would go to aid small businesses 
250 million would be set aside in for kitty for bush to spend 
for the victims as he sees fit 
damage estimates from the earthquake have topped 7 billion 
a 50foot section of the bay bridge toppled and must be 
replaced doubledeck highways on both sides of san francisco bay 
sustained severe damage up to 1000 homes in san francisco alone 
are said to need extensive repairs 
at least 63 people died 
earlier this week the independent insurance agents of america 
estimated damage from the quake at 71 billion damage from hugo 
had been estimated at 4 billion to 5 billion and from the 1906 
san francisco quake the previous record at 58 billion after 
adjustments for inflation 
money allocated to the federal emergency management agency will 
provide for temporary housing home repairs unemployment payments 
grants to families and assistance for local governments 
there was no dispute over the need for the emergency allocation 
among lawmakers who considered the proposal with unusual speed 
much debate focused on whether the spending in the legislation 
and in the earlier measure to aid victims of hugo should be 
included in the governments calculations of the federal deficit 
on a 40118 vote the house decided it should the shortfall for 
fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 has previously been projected by 
the congressional budget office to be 141 billion 
the 285 billion was approved as part of an emergency spending 
bill needed to keep the government functioning until nov 15 the 
legal authority that most agencies have to spend money expires at 
midnight wednesday 
the special legislation is needed because only two of the 13 
annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 
have been signed into law

west germanys defense minister said 
tuesday the kremlin admission that one of its radars violates the 
1972 abm treaty was a remarkable example of the change taking 
place in the soviet union 
gerhard stoltenberg said the speech monday by soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze containing the statement was a 
true sign of glasnost the policy of openness promoted by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
stoltenberg and the other nato defense ministers are in this 
resort for a semiannual meeting of the western alliances nuclear 
planning group 
the fact that he stands up and says straight out that 
krasnoyarsk was a violation of the antiballistic missile treaty is 
a whole new language stoltenberg told reporters after the 
tuesday afternoon session 
he said there had been no time for a full analysis of the 
changes under way in the soviet bloc 
frits bolkestein the dutch defense minister said the final 
statement wednesday was expected to welcome shevardnadzes pledge 
that the krasnoyarsk radar in siberia would be dismantled 
it was an acknowledgement of what the united states has 
maintained for a long time and we obviously applaud this 
recognition said a senior us official who demanded anonymity 
shevardnadze speaking to the soviet legislature said the 
krasnoyarsk radar had been a stumbling block to agreement with the 
west on other arms issues 
we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons shevardnadze said 
he also said the soviet union was prepared to withdraw all 
military forces to its own territory by the year 2000 and negotiate 
elimination of the opposing nato and warsaw pact alliances 
the nato defense ministers meeting for two days at the quinta 
do lago vacation complex on portugals southern algarve coast 
rejected the latter idea 
i can assure you were not thinking of disbanding nato 
stoltenberg said and called shevardnadzes offer an old formula 
more vague and abstract than before 
bolkestein said theres not much left of the warsaw pact in 
terms of true cohesion the same thing cannot be said of nato 
hungary and poland have are moving away from oneparty communist 
rule and moscow has made no move to stop them but they have sworn 
continued allegiance to the eastern defense alliance 
stoltenberg said ministers agreed tuesday that the future role 
of nato nuclear forces would be studied after the signing of a 
conventional arms reduction treaty expected at the end of talks 
now being conducted in vienna austria 
he said he expected preliminary drafts of six papers for the 
study to be ready next year and anticipated concrete proposals 
by 1991 
during the morning session us defense secretary dick cheney 
said soviet spending on strategic and space weapons had not slowed 
under gorbachevs program of reform officials reported 
us aides estimated the kremlin spends 20 billion to 40 
billion a year on its space program dutch officials said 
all 16 nato nations attend the nuclear strategy sessions except 
france which is not a member of natos integrated military 
structure iceland which has no armed forces attends as an 
observer

as a governors panel prepares to 
probe the deadly earthquakecollapse of interstate 880 outsiders 
are hurling their theories at state officials inundated by monday 
morning quarterbacks 
california transportation department officials have declined to 
speculate on the collapse and are refusing to share information 
they might have about why a 1mile section of freeway in oakland 
fell down in the massive quake 
thirtynine bodies have been recovered from the rubble of i880 
making up more than half the 63 quake casualties more are 
expected from the collapse as rescuers carefully search the 
unstable rubble 
outside engineers and structural experts whose views are being 
sought largely by the news media are blaming everything from a 
lack of steel in the vertical columns to unstable soil beneath the 
structure and the peculiar way the structure may have synchronized 
with earthquake waves 
few have visited the wreckage and must draw their conclusions 
from news accounts and pictures caltrans is still not letting 
anybody in but their own people to take a look complained 
scientist glenn borchardt an expert on soil stability with the 
state division of mines and geology 
were not going to get into that said caltrans structural 
chief jim roberts when asked again if the department has ideas 
about the cause of the collapse the department maintains that it 
was as surprised as gov george deukmejian that the structure fell 
down and spokesman jim drago said the agency is tired of all the 
monday morning quarterbacks 
ive been assured there were no experts no studies no data 
that suggested in any way that it would fall said caltrans 
director robert best 
but in the quakes wake experts are offering their theories 
and old studies and documents are beginning to surface 
generally experts and caltrans agree on a general observation 
the structure opened in july 1957 was built with outofdate 
earthquake safety codes and the materials used such as concrete 
are not as strong as material available today 
beyond that the theories are varied 
among them 
an engineer hired by the new york times dr piotr d moncarz 
of palo alto who was able to visit the site suggested that the 
freeway was brought down partly because seismic waves coincided 
with the swinging of the structure amplifying the quakes power 
soils expert borchardt who first raised the soil instability 
issue in a 1982 report on earthquake dangers said the ground 
beneath the structure made up largely of clay may have 
liquefied or at least amplified the quakes effect 
former state highway engineer jim see said the freeway fell 
because reinforcing bar in the concrete pillars was not braced or 
wrapped with more steel 
dr nigel priestly a structural expert at the university of 
california at san diego said lack of steel in the columns 
contributed to their collapse but added that steel connections 
holding the roadway to the columns also were suspect 
john kariotis a south pasadena structural engineer said the 
columns could have been strengthened with steel jackets to avoid 
collapse an argument rejected by roberts who said their own 
experiments showed that wouldnt have worked 
in the end drago said all the theories might turn out to be 
correct but theyre little help now because you never get two 
engineers to agree on anything

canada should help create a demilitarized zone in 
the arctic a panel recommended tuesday at a conference on 
cooperation with the soviet union 
the proposal came as part of armscontrol discussions for the 
region by the 13member panel that included disarmament experts 
retired canadian military officers and native indian 
representatives 
the recommendations including an end to simulated bombings over 
the region came on the second day of a fourday conference on 
canadiansoviet arctic cooperation 
in its recommendations the panel said the arctic should be made 
into a demilitarized zone that prohibits military aircraft carrying 
nuclear weapons from flying in or out of the region 
however it said under its proposal that members of nato and the 
warsaw pact would be allowed to fly over the region to verify 
armscontrol agreements 
the panel also said the superpowers should agree to strict 
limits or a total ban on sealaunched cruise missiles from arctic 
waters 
the group further called for the soviet union to agree to keep 
its submarines out of canadas arctic waters and halt weapons tests 
at novaya zemlya in the soviet arctic 
at a conference dinner monday canadas junior minister for 
indian and northern affairs said negotiating arctic security issues 
outside of eastwest arms talks now under way could prove 
destabilizing 
the minister kim campbell said the best way to ensure peace 
and security in the arctic is to lend full support to the 
eastwest negotiations on arms control 
andrei granowsky a soviet foreign ministry official said he 
couldnt comment officially because the conference proposals didnt 
come from the canadian government however he said soviets 
attending the conference had welcomed the ideas 
we appreciate the fact that canadian scholars are expressing 
new ideas to strengthen security in the region he said we 
need a stockpile of ideas for future dialogue we ourselves are 
searching for new concepts 
the conference was sponsored by the arms control center an 
independent ottawa thinktank and the union of the soviet 
friendship societies a group that promotes multinational 
cooperation

california state lawmakers who spent tuesday 
in washington said they were encouraged by meetings with 
administration officials and a house vote for an earthquake relief 
package but the praise was less than unanimous 
we think we have been very successful here as it relates to 
the administration said state senator bill campbell discussing 
meetings held with a variety of federal officials our 
congressional delegation has been successful 
were very happy with our input here said campbell a 
republican 
campbell said the group of six assembly members and four 
senators met with transportation secretary samuel skinner housing 
secretary jack kemp acting federal emergency management agency 
chief grant peterson the deputy director of the office of 
management and budget and a member of the white house staff 
he said that among the progress made was a commitment by 
fema to look at the idea of sending in trailers to house the 
8000 to 10000 people left homeless in santa cruz and watsonville 
areas south of san francisco a commitment from fema to extend 
emergency housing grants to three months for renters and more than 
four months for homeowners if needed a promise to expand the 
number of disaster application centers if necessary and a move by 
kemp to free 500 million for earthquake aid 
campbell also said that the small business administration will 
get together with the office of management and budget to talk about 
raising the current cap on home repair loans by the small business 
administration from 100000 to 500000 
lawmakers say raising the cap is necessary given the high cost 
of real estate in the area and it could be done with an 
administrative order if budget director richard darman would agree 
the aid package passed by the house includes a requirement that 
the cap be raised californians have argued that the action would 
be too slow 
state assemblyman richard katz a democrat who heads the 
assemblys transportation committee said he was generally 
satisfied with the response from washington but was concerned about 
the source of the 1 billion in bridge and road repair funds from 
tuesdays housepassed legislation 
the billion dollars that you heard talked about for 
transportation to some extent right now is a fiction he said 
its a billion dollars that would have come to california anyhow 
over the next several years and under the current proposal were 
getting it earlier 
we will go back to the state today with better feelings than 
we came more work that needs to be done he said we will go 
into special session next week and we will probably either generate 
some sales tax revenue or some additional revenue on our side to do 
part of the job from our standpoint but again were going to need 
additional help from the white house

the arab league on tuesday promised 
an accord for a complete syrian troop withdrawal from lebanon 
where christian leader gen michel aoun rejected a peace plan that 
lacks a timetable 
thousands of aoun supporters demonstrated in beirut on tuesday 
and burned tires in the streets after moslem and christian members 
of lebanons parliament approved the plan in taif saudi arabia on 
sunday 
the peace plan which is aimed at ending 14 years of 
christianmoslem fighting gives more political power to the moslem 
majority it also says syria which backs moslem leaders must pull 
its troops out of the lebanese capital within two years 
but the forces estimated at 40000 could remain in the eastern 
bekaa valley near the syrian border and the plan had no timetable 
for a total withdrawal 
the arab league said the duration of the syrian forces stay in 
the bekaa will be defined by an accord between the syrian and 
lebanese governments the 22member arab league it said will 
be charged with concluding and implementing that accord 
the commitment came in a document read by saudi foreign minister 
prince saud alfaisal at the closing session of the lebanese 
parliament that was called by the arab league 
the document called on the lebanese parliament to meet in 
lebanon no later than nov 7 to ratify political reforms that were 
agreed upon in the peace plan and to elect a president for their 
fractured nation 
the fivepage document was signed by the arab league committee 
comprising king fahd of saudi arabia moroccos king hassan ii and 
algerian president chadli bendjedid the three leaders were asked 
by an arab league summit meeting in may to try to help find a 
settlement to the sectarian turmoil in lebanon 
king fahd chairing the closing session in the red sea port of 
jiddah told the 63 parliamentarians present that the peace plan 
reached in the resort of taif was a great achievement 
he thanked syrian president hafez assad and president saddam 
hussein of iraq for their cooperation indicating he had won 
approval from the two enemies to stop arming rival factions in 
lebanon saddam backs the christians and assad is the moslems 
main supporter 
fahd promised unspecified financial support to restore lebanon 
better than it was once the peace plan is carried out 
but as the final meeting got under way 10000 young followers 
of aoun marched through the christian enclave north of beirut to 
protest the accord 
addressing the demonstrators aoun said the reference in the 
peace accord to the timing of a syrian withdrawal is very vague 
from now until eternity 
we dont want to give away our beloved land he said 
the peace accord also would eventually lead to the disbanding of 
militias and the main shiite groups the syrianbacked amal and 
the proiranian hezbollah have rejected the accord druse warlord 
walid jumblatt also has criticized it 
samir geagea who commands the main christian militia the 
lebanese forces still has not committed himself either way 
syrian forces came to lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate and now control 70 percent of lebanese 
territory aoun claims the syrians have violated their mandate by 
siding with moslems in the civil war and his 20000 troops fought 
the syrians for six months until the arab leaguebrokered 
ceasefire sept 22 
aoun a maronite catholic has not openly criticized any of the 
political reforms suggested in the peace charter that are mainly 
designed to give moslems an equal share of power with the 
christians 
these include increasing parliament seats from 99 to 108 to 
give moslems equal representation in the legislature 
the reforms also redistribute the powers of the president 
traditionally a maronite catholic the prime minister a sunni 
moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem to ensure 
wider moslem participation in the decisionmaking process 
christians have dominated power since independence from france 
in 1943 when they were considered the majority moslems now make 
up 55 percent of the population of 4 million 
lebanon has been without a head of state since amin gemayels 
term expired sept 22 1988 with parliament unable to meet to 
elect a successor the vacuum produced two rival cabinets one 
christian headed by aoun and a syrianbacked government headed by 
salim hoss a sunni

the national jaycees president said tuesday 
he plans to go to the soviet union in december to help three 
estonian groups become chapters of the service organization 
if we can get them going in the soviet union we can get in 
the other eastern bloc nations as well said robby dawkins us 
jaycees president 
dawkins was in nebraska to recognize the states high national 
ranking in the organization 
he said in a telephone interview he would go to the soviet union 
dec 115 to try to start jaycees chapters behind the iron 
curtain 
if we can get the jaycees started over there and if they 
dont get oppressed and they are free to learn and grow as 
individuals then we might possibly be changing the course of 
history in the next 25 years when those people who were in jaycees 
become the leaders he said 
the us jaycees began 70 years ago with 29 chapters and has 
grown to 240000 members in 5000 communities he said there are 
jaycees chapters in 93 countries including poland where one began 
about two years ago dawkins said

the communist party daily pravda on monday ivan t frolov a

gov george deukmejian said tuesday 
that tax increases to pay for last weeks devastating earthquake 
would be a last resort he would turn to only if federal aid and the 
state surplus prove insufficient 
i certainly have not ruled out the possibility of a tax 
increase the governor said after a briefing with disaster 
officials in watsonville californias salad bowl where much 
of the states lettuce artichokes and berries are harvested 
we are going to have to see whether or not there is going to 
be a need for additional revenues said deukmejian speaking to 
reporters over the din of power saws hammers and tractors in the 
central city 
we are waiting to see what the federal government is going to 
do they are moving very quickly the governor said 
the us house on tuesday passed a 285 billion aid package and 
sent the measure to the senate the state surplus stands at 1 
billion 
deukmejian on monday said a special session of the state 
legislature would be called in the next two weeks to evaluate 
earthquake damage and arrange for relief that could include a 
temporary increase in sales or gasoline taxes 
the legislature completed its 1989 session sept 16 and is not 
due to return until january 
the governor also said monday that he and legislative leaders 
discussed the possibility of holding an earlier special election 
to consider a ballot measure currently slated for june 1990 that 
proposal would liberalize the states spending limit and pave the 
way for a gradual 9cent gasoline tax increase 
the governor flew to watsonville on tuesday for a briefing on 
damages by city fire chief gary smith who said hopefully within 
the year we will be back on our feet and you wont even notice 
as of tuesday the damage total was near a halfbillion dollars 
in watsonville a community of 27000 people regionwide estimates 
topped 7 billion from the oct 17 quake 
the citys main street was still cordoned off and thousands of 
people either displaced from their homes or too frightened to 
return indoors congregated in makeshift tent cities 
outside salvation army headquarters about 50 people lined up 
for tents sleeping bags clothing food and household items but 
outside the main street area businesses were open 
spokeswoman colleen mcquillan said the red cross fed breakfast 
to 5357 people tuesday the city estimates 1200 residents are out 
of their homes because of the quake while red crross and salvation 
army say up to 5000 people are sleeping in tents 
deukmejian met privately with officials in city hall and later 
with smith in an open session spokesman kevin brett said it was 
unnecessary for the governor to get out of his car to see the 
damage or suffering 
as you are driving into town the damage is very evident 
brett said

the chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said tuesday that he and president bush have no 
philosophical difference about easing guidelines for involvement 
by cia operatives in coups in which a foreign leader might be 
killed 
sen david boren dokla said he wanted to clear up ambiguities 
in the guidelines within a matter of days or a few weeks as 
opposed to months 
saying that reports of disagreement with bush were greatly 
exaggerated boren said were working in perfect harmony we 
have not had a quarrelsome word about it we have no philosophical 
difference 
bush had similar remarks about boren the day before 
the unsuccessful coup attempt against panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega brought to light a series of classified guidelines 
that restrict the actions of cia officials under a longstanding 
prohibition against assassinations 
bush reportedly complained last week in a private meeting that 
an understanding reached between the reagan administration and the 
senate intelligence panel could if narrowly interpreted require 
the united states to warn noriega of any coup that might endanger 
his life 
boren confirmed that his committee and the reagan administration 
reached an understanding last year to restrict covert activities 
against noriega because of the presidential elections in the united 
states 
the committee said lets wait weve got an election season 
to let the new presidentelect have some input into it boren 
said 
boren speaking with reporters at the white house endorsed the 
administations call for a freer hand 
i for one dont believe that the prohibition against 
assassinations should keep you from working with someone that might 
want to overthrow a government boren said 
those people wouldnt be aimed at hurting anyone or 
assassinating anyone the senator said they want to overthrow 
a government you cant guarantee that someone might not get hurt 
in overthrowing a government 
i certainly dont believe there should be any affirmative 
obligation to inform someone like gen noriega of any plan that we 
might learn about that might harm him in any way he said i 
think that goes far beyond what the executive order ever intended 
boren was among a group of senators that met with bush on his 
campaign for a cut in the capital gains tax rate however he was 
questioned by reporters later about the restrictions on cia agents 
the president and i have not had a feud about this boren 
said in fact we were just joking about it a minute ago we dont 
know where the feud came from

before april 1 would be deleted from the list 
the agreement to pare down the list was reached at the urging of 
the international cricket conference and the international 
motorcycling federation both of which are shunning the apartheid 
state said gbeho 
however the removal of names is on a onetime basis and 
cricketers and motorcyclists will still be added to the list if

president bush impatient with congress 
refusal to vote him lineitem veto powers is considering casting 
such a veto anyway to see if it works spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said tuesday 
fitzwater told reporters that the white house is seeking 
legislation on which bush could exercise a partial veto and allow 
the courts to decide whether the president acted legally 
we are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test 
case but at this point we dont have one fitzwater said 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the civil and 
constitutional rights subcommittee of the house judiciary 
committee said tuesday that presidents do not have lineitem veto 
authority under the constitution 
that is an idea that many of us would resist very 
diligently edwards said in an interview it would give the 
president enormous new legislative powers that our founding fathers 
didnt have in mind for the president 
he said that were bush to try to cast such a veto a majority 
of the members of the judiciary committee would promptly take him 
to court 
such a move vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the 
rest intact would be certain to provoke a major constitutional 
confrontation with the democratic majority in both the house and 
the senate fitzwater conceded 
weve got a lot of issues that probably wouldnt sit well with 
the democratic leadership but there is a larger question here 
fitzwater said he said that he assumed that such a veto would be 
challenged immediately in court 
bush and president reagan before him proposed a constitutional 
amendment to spell out a right to vetosingle items in spending 
bills however such proposals have never gotten far in congress 
both bush and budget director richard darman have raised the 
possibility of proceeding directly with such a veto to provoke a 
court challenge 
but the subject gained new attention with a comment on monday by 
vice president dan quayle in chicago 
asked if bush were prepared to make such a challenge now quayle 
said this is an issue in which he has stated a great deal of 
interest and if he can find an appropriate part of a piece of 
legislation to test that constitutionality i think that he would 
be inclined to do so 
fitzwater said the administration is willing to force the issue 
and prompt a court case believing that the president has such 
powers and should be able to exercise them 
you just try to do it and see if it works you claim you 
have the authority and you just do it fitzwater said 
meanwhile the spokesman said the president was intensifying his 
campaign for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet 
with senators mostly democrats this week to lobby for the plan 
which has already passed the house 
fitzwater declared that the administration has the votes to pass 
the cut if it can have a straight majorityrule vote on the 
measure in the senate 
give us an opportunity for a vote thats all we ask 
fitzwater said accusing senate democratic leaders of holding up 
the nations budget just to make a point on capital gains 
bush met with about 10 democratic senators to solicit advice on 
how to get his proposal approved sen james exon dneb told 
reporters later that he suggested delaying the matter until next 
year 
theres nothing critical about the economy right now that 
requires that we have a capital gains cut right now exxon 
said were going through a test of wills he said that senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine has enough votes to block 
consideration of a reduction now 
the house approved a twoyear cut in the tax rate on capital 
gains increases in the value of stocks bonds and real estate 
to 196 percent from the current maximum rate of 33 percent

a judge ordered zsa zsa gabor to 
spend 72 hours behind bars tuesday for slapping a beverly hills 
policeman during a traffic stop telling her if you slap a cop 
you go to jail 
municipal judge charles rubin also ordered miss gabor to pay 
293750 in fines and penalties and 10000 restitution for 
extraordinary costs to the city due to the cases notoriety he 
directed the former beauty queen from hungary to perform 120 hours 
of community service at a shelter for homeless women 
the judge repeatedly admonished and rebuked the sullen 
sometimes smirking miss gabor telling her she had shown contempt 
for justice police and the american people and that she had tried 
to milk the case for publicity 
the law applies to everyone whether they are rich or poor and 
whether they are famous or not rubin said before sentencing her 
in the absence of extremely mitigating circumstances if you 
slap a cop you go to jail 
rubin sentenced miss gabor to two concurrent 24month jail 
terms but suspended them and ordered her to serve 96 hours in 
jail with credit for 24 hours served after her arrest june 14 
miss gabors sentence requires her to serve the 72hour term by 
dec 29 with no possibility of early release should she violate 
any condition of the sentence she will have to serve 18 months 
the judge said the sentence was common for such offenses 
defense attorney harrison bull said no decision had been made on 
whether to appeal miss gabors sentence or conviction 
the actress was convicted sept 29 of battery on a police 
officer driving without a valid drivers license and having an 
open container of alcohol in her car she was acquitted of failing 
to obey an officer 
the tempestuous miss gabor slapped officer paul kramer on june 
14 after he stopped her rollsroyce convertible the actress 
testified that she instinctively struck out after kramer roughed 
her up she said kramer had overreacted and used undue force in 
arresting her 
during her trial miss gabors antics included rushing out of 
the courtroom and telling reporters that justice was better under 
the nazis during world war ii rubin said she engaged in a public 
tantrum 
its time for you to stop it the judge said its time 
for you to start acting like the lady you so repeatedly say you 
are 
the judge still had to admonish miss gabor not to laugh during 
sentencing 
noting with a cough that she was admittedly in her mid60s 
but otherwise vibrant and active rubin also said her age should 
play no role in sparing her time behind bars 
the star of such bmovies as queen of outer space and 
picture mommy dead is secretive about her age but according to 
court documents is 66 
the judge told her to have her drivers license changed so it 
reflects her correct age prompting laughter in the courtroom 
he also directed that she be interviewed once by a psychiatrist 
rubin ordered miss gabor not to discuss her case or give 
interviews while doing her community service and asked reporters 
to stay away from her then 
the judge said her action verbally slapped the faces of every 
cop 
she was not satisfied with that she turned around and slapped 
the face of every american by comparing justice in the united 
states to communist russia and nazi germany he said 
in brief comments outside court miss gabor said im a very 
good american i love america why should i slap the face of 
america 
her husband frederick von anhalt said im very upset about 
it im upset because they are sending my wife to jail 
when she was first convicted we felt that the police 
department and officer kramer were vindicated police spokesman 
lt robert curtis said after miss gabors sentencing we 
certainly feel that this is even further vindication 
wearing a black dress miss gabor arrived at court in a black 
mercedes benz with her husband passing before a crowd of about 100 
reporters 
she listened to character witnesses testify on her behalf with 
her chin thrust up and at one point sprayed herself with perfume 
bull asked rubin to sentence miss gabor to probation deputy 
district attorney elden fox argued for tough punishment 
how dare the defendant suggest that she was not tried by a 
jury of her peers fox said how dare she suggest they do not 
understand the class of people that she comes from

commuters in the san francisco bay area 
took to public transportation in unprecedented numbers tuesday and 
transit officials hope they make it a permanent habit 
with so many of the 3 million commuters using public transit 
traffic along the freeways flowed smoothly despite predictions of 
gridlock 
gov george deukmejian met with executives of 150 bay area 
companies urging them to encourage use of mass transit car pools 
vans ferries flexible work hours and modified truck delivery 
schedules 
if stories begin to circulate that things are not as bad as 
expected then greater numbers of people might start getting back 
in their cars rather than using mass transit or using ride 
sharing he said we want to caution people not to do that 
rod diridon chairman of the metropolitan transportation 
commission a regional planning agency and other transit officials 
say the transportation problems facing northern californians are 
not tied just to the oct 17 earthquake 
for years transit officials have tried to get californians to 
make more use of public transportation and ease the overloaded 
highway system but they were up against a virtual love affair 
between residents and their vehicles 
then the major earthquake forced changes for commuters used to 
driving to work usually alone 
they really need to make permanent adjustments said 
diridon we might as well bite the bullet 
transit officials had feared massive traffic jams from the 
closure of the san franciscooakland bay bridge but tuesday they 
found smooth sailing for ferryboats highway traffic and trains 
the commute went excellent everything went fine said vicki 
wills spokeswoman for the bay area rapid transit system which 
runs trains beneath the bay no delays we rated our commute this 
morning as excellent 
bart was expected to pick up many of the 65000 people who 
normally enter san francisco over the bay bridge at rush hour in 
cars or buses by 9 am tuesday bart had set a new weekday 
ridership record with 99135 4300 more than the previous day 
traffic along highways and other roads was operating very 
smoothly according to highway patrol spokesman don gappa he 
said the accident rate was no higher than normal 
for commuters arriving on bart trains at san franciscos civic 
center stop the morning trips were mostly routine though a bit 
more crowded than usual 
the train went quickly its working well said bill 
edmonds a new bart rider from oakland the regulatory analyst left 
20 minutes later tuesday his second day on bart and still made it 
to work on time 
it was almost normal i couldnt believe it said longtime 
bart rider robert lang a supervisor for housing and urban 
development theres a lot of new people and they seem to be 
making the adjustment 
lang also believes the quake may compel some people to begin 
using public transit for good 
theres usually a silver lining in a lot of things its not 
surprising there will be a silver lining in this traffic and 
other things said lang 
in the south bay the number of commuters using van and car 
pools was up 500 percent according to the mtcs diridon 
but red and white fleet spokesman dick arnold said tuesday that 
less than half the available space on the fleets 16 boats is being 
used by commuters despite free or cheap parking and reduced fares 
of 5 roundtrip 
the boats can handle more than 7000 passengers and the tuesday 
morning count was about 3200 he said 
were puzzled why ore people arent trying this said 
arnold one television station had a picture of someone on a boat 
throwing up and that didnt help much 
arnold also said rough weather monday spoooked people but 
he said the bay was calmer tuesday 
the mtc had predicted that 2 million of the 3 million weekday 
commuters would encounter delays of some kind 
their fears were prompted by last wities 
will be closed for at least one month 
in oakland a mileplus section of interstate 880 the nimitz 
freeway collapsed killing dozens other closed freeways include 
the embarcadero freeway along the waterfront in san francisco and a 
fivemile stetch of interstate 280 also in the city 
in santa cruz only one lane of state highway 17 a link to the 
silconn valley was open because of landslides and mudslides

supporters of legislation that would ease 
restrictions on federally financed abortions for poor women 
scheduled a house vote on wednesday in an attempt to override 
president bushs veto hoping a changing political climate could 
give them a second surprise victory 
rep barbara boxer dcalif who sponsored the successful 
amendment said its going to be very tough but were working 
to win 
but opponents of the change which would relax the prohibition 
on medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest said they 
were confident they had the votes to upphold bushs veto 
a twothirds vote of house members present is needed to override 
the veto if all 434 current members were present 290 votes would 
be needed to override the veto 
the liberalized abortion language passed on a 216206 vote two 
weeks ago and supporters acknowledged they had a long way to go to 
override the president 
we dont know how many votes well get tomorrow we dont know 
whether well get 217 or 270 said rep charles schumer dny 
a supporter of expanded abortion availability but we know 
the pendulum is swinging in our direction 
the measure is part of a 1567 billion appropriations bill for 
education labor and health programs 
bush said he was seeking room for flexibility on the issue 
immediately after the house vote but under pressure from 
antiabortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill 
on saturday 
the times are not changing said rep robert dornan 
rcalif a leading abortion opponent we will sustain his veto 
tomorrow on the floor 
house speaker tom foley dwash called bushs veto 
mistaken and said the democratic house leadership was seeking 
votes to override the veto but he said the vote is not a party 
issue in the sense that we dont recognize that other members of 
the party have a different position 
the newest house democrat is rep gene taylor of mississippi 
sworn in tuesday after being elected in a special election last 
week standing with foley at a swearingin ceremony taylor told 
reporters he opposes any federal funding for abortion and would 
vote to sustain bushs veto 
but another freshman democrat reversed a lifelong antiabortion 
stance to announce he would vote to override the president 
in what he described as the most difficult and agonizing 
decision of his political career rep frank pallone jr of new 
jersey said he remains opposed to abortion but has come to believe 
sound public policy and the needs of american women are best 
served if access to legal and medically safe abortion is 
maintained 
supporters of the liberalized abortion language said they were 
urging colleagues to change their minds on the issue and were 
urging constituents to contact their representative 
a conservative repubican rep arthur ravenel jr rsc said 
he supported the broader abortion language and believed some 
republicans would shift to override the veto 
im finding some movement in my republican colleagues 
ravenel said i think its possible we just may override the 
presidents veto 
the abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981 
that bans all federally financed abortions for poor women under the 
medicaid program except in cases where the life of the mother is 
endangered by her pregnancy 
although the senate had endorsed more relaxed abortion curbs 
the house had insisted on that language until its vote two weeks 
ago to accept the more liberal senatepassed version that vote 
came at a time when abortionrights supporters said they were 
enjoying new political success since a supreme court ruling last 
summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions and brought 
new attention to the issue 
the national right to life committee the leading antiabortion 
organization distributed copies of a letter sent to bush in june 
pleding to uphold any veto of more liberalized federal abortion 
laws it said 152 house members signed that letter 
that number if all voted would be more than enough to sustain 
a veto on the groups list however were some members such as 
ravenel who have since voted the other way or who did not vote two 
weeks ago

the first of an expected long line of 
damage claims against the state from the oct 17 earthquake were 
filed tuesday by two workers injured in the collapse of the nimitz 
freeway bridge their lawyer said 
the claims were filed with the state board of control whose 
rejection would clear the way for a lawsuit they contend the 
california department of transportation had been aware for over a 
decade that the doubledeck interstate 880 structure was defective 
and dangerous in an earthquake 
the lawyer r lewis van blois cited published reports of 
statements made by even caltrans engineers and former engineers 
references to interoffice memos and the 1982 task force study that 
stated in essence that the elevated structure would receive 
extensive damage in an earthquake 
ever since the 1971 san fernando quake and the problems that

the bush administration said tuesday it had 
asked other countries to give americans more opportunity to provide 
the services that make up an increasing part of international trade 
the us delegation on monday presented a 20page draft 
agreement in geneva switzerland to a meeting of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the first such draft presented in 
complete form said trade representative carla a hills 
delegates from 107 countries are taking part in the 
negotiations which for the first time are trying to cover trade in 
services everything from accounting to zoo management 
the us delegation presents proposals on wednesday aimed at 
abolishing export subsidies for farm products within 10 years 
a source in geneva said indian delegate v j ganesan told the 
closeddoor meeting that an agreememnt must reflect the need of 
third world countries to protect their own service companies 
against too much foreign competiton he was supported by brazil 
yugoslavia and tanzania the source added 
ms hills told a news conference that under the us proposal 
the world market in services would be open to the greatest possible 
extent to firms everywhere 
they would face a fair predictable environment for their 
services throughout the world said the official summary of the 
proposal 
she said it seeks to 
enable firms from any country to set up shop in any other and 
be treated like local firms 
limit governments distortion of trade in services through 
regulations subsidies and their own monopolies 
require that national laws on services be administered openly 
gatt which is an organization as well as an agreement has 
always dealt with trade in actual goods and not in what were once 
called invisibles 
the problem today is that trade has outgrown the gatt ms 
hills said 
areas poorly govered by gatt rules like agriculture or not 
covered at all like services investment and intellectual property 
itemsw such as copyrights are of much greater importance than 
they once were 
now tourism banking insurance airline services and computer 
work can be among a countrys most significant exports or imports 
all told more than 1 trillion in goods and services trade is 
not adequately covered by international rules of fair play ms 
hills complained 
world trade in services last year totalled 560 billion the 
united states exported 90 billion worth of services last year and 
imported only about 70 billion making a 20 billion contribution 
to the nations balance of payments

activists from india asked members of congress 
tuesday to help stop world bank support of a gigantic dam project 
they said threatens to displace thousands of people without 
compensation and cause an environmental disaster 
rep james scheuer dny told a house natural resources 
subcommittee the narmada valley project in three states of western 
india may be an example of development projects that undervalue 
the costs associated with environmental degradation and human 
displacement 
the united states is the largest contributor to the world bank 
and us taxpayers dollars helped finance the project thus 
congress should check the accuracy of criticism that the narmada 
dam was approved without proper environmental impact studies or 
resettlement plans he said 
a treasury representative said the united states supported the 
project on the basis that those displaced would be compensated and 
that human welfare objectives of the project are met specific 
cost and contribution figures were not available 
continuing involvement by the world bank might be more helpful 
than a breakoff of support however in solving environmental and 
human welfare issues that have turned out to be more complex 
than anticipated said treasury official frank vukmanic 
the bank may be the only point of leverage to achieve needed 
environmental reforms he added if the bank backs away from 
this project there is the possibility that private sources of 
funding may be available with no real prospect of resolving the 
problem 
scheuer said 60000 of the dams intended beneficiaries 
demonstrated against its construction in september in india 
the project will turn 100000 farmers into migrant laborers and 
benefit mainly politicians contractors and agricultural lobbies 
testified medha patkar a sociologist representing the save the 
narmada action committee one hundred thirtyone cities north of 
bombay will receive 90 percent of the projects benefits she said 
with only 10 percent of the benefit going to 4720 villages 
indian economist vijay paranjpye said his own figures found 
calculations and cost overruns so serious that india will not be 
able to complete the project in 25 years

the government reported that 
france exploded a 25kiloton nuclear device wednesday at its test 
site on mururoa atoll new zealand condemned the action as an 
affront to residents of the south pacific 
government scientists said the blast was detected by new 
zealands seismological station in rarotonga cook islands at 530 
am local time 
the countries of the south pacific have made it abundantly 
clear on innumerable occasions that they have had enough of nuclear 
testing in the region said disarmament and arms control minister 
fran wilde 
the continued testing of these devices in the pacific is an 
affront to all of us who live here she said 
warwick smith head of the seismological observatory at the 
department of scientific and industrial research said it was 108th 
test at mururoa since france abandoned atmospheric testing there in 
1975 
it followed tests this year on may 11 may 20 june 3 and june 
10 when the largest device estimated to amount to 70 kilotons or 
the equivalent of 70000 tons of tnt was exploded 
smith said wednesdays blast probably meant that france was 
beginning a new round of four tests for the remainder of this year 
there was a series of four in may and june this year and the 
pattern over the past five years has been two series of four each 
year he said 
earlier this year the french government said it would reduce the 
number of annual tests from eight to six

a woman died of a head wound tuesday following 
delivery of her baby hours after she and her husband were 
abducted robbed and shot by someone who apparently thought they 
were police 
the suburban couple drawn to boston for its medical facilities 
had recently said they were concerned about the rise in violence in 
the city friends said 
police had no immediate suspects in the shooting 
carol and charles stuart were located by the sound of police 
sirens coming through the cellular telephone stuart used to call 
for help before he passed out 
mrs stuart a 33yearold lawyer died early tuesday at brigham 
and womens hospital just six hours earlier she and her husband 
had left that same hospital after attending their birthing class 
the couple lived in reading 13 miles north of the city 
the baby boy his parents had planned to call him christopher 
a friend said was delivered one month premature by caesarean 
section hospital spokeswoman louise homer said the hospital would 
not disclose the infants condition 
after leaving the hospital at about 8 pm monday the stuarts 
were accosted by a man in the parking lot who got into their car 
and forced them to drive to an inner city neighborhood there they 
were robbed of their watches and other belongings and shot 
the gunman apparently thought the stuarts were police officers 
because of the celluar phone in their car said police deputy 
superintendent joseph dunford before shooting the stuarts 
according to dunford the gunman said i think youre fiveo 
slang for police 
stuart 29 general manager of a fur store in bostons back bay 
was in critical condition tuesday at boston city hospital with a 
gunshot wound in the abdomen 
state police dispatcher gary mclaughlin got a few details from 
stuart during the 10minute call before he blacked out 
my wifes been shot ive been shot stuart said according 
to an edited transcript of the call which was punctuated by his 
groans 
stuart didnt know where he was and acting on mclaughlins 
instructions drove to an intersection where he could see a street 
sign he passed out before he could give the dispatcher an 
intersection 
officers in patrol cars were told to flick their sirens on and 
off one by one the dispatcher was able to tell which police car 
was near the stuarts car from the sound of the sirens coming 
through the car phone 
get my wife out stuart told the police officers who found 
him 
the ambulance crew that came to the aid of stuart and his wife 
had been riding with a camera crew from the cbs series rescue 
911 which tells reallife stories about rescue operations 
the crew videotaped stuart regaining consciousness and talking 
about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to boston 
city hospital and was allowed into the emergency room cbs 
spokesman mike silver said in new york 
mayor raymond flynn told police commissioner frances roache 
hed like to get every available detective on the case 
police spokeswoman jill reilly said 
at a press conference tuesday flynn was asked why this slaying 
was getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in 
other distressed areas of the city 
there will be the same aggressive and fair and consistent 
enforcement of all our laws regardless of where it takes place 
he said 
brigham and womens is one of a number of hospitals clustered 
around harvard medical school 
its setting is deceptive the hospital complex is a stones 
throw from brookline the affluent suburb where gov michael 
dukakis lives but it also is adjacent to bostons crimeridden 
roxbury section and dark woods 
gang wars driveby shootings and drugrelated violence are on 
the rise perplexing and alarming residents and prompting police to 
conduct controversial onthespot searches 
ted kakas an owner of the fur store where stuart has worked for 
eight years said the stuarts child was their first they had just 
celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary he said 
so many senseless things going on said peter jaworski 24 
a close friend of stuart and assistant manager at the fur store 
last night the police commissioner told us you just have to keep

the state council said tuesday that 
colombia will continue to extradite drug traffickers sought in the 
united states and will not negotiate with the cocaine cartels 
it said a decree issued aug 19 by president virgilio barco 
allowing extradition to the united states has been applied and 
will continue to be applied barco issued the decree after 
assassins shot to death a leading presidential candidate 
meanwhile the bodyguard of a manager for the antidrug 
crusading newspaper el espectador was fatally shot tuesday in 
western medellin police said the victim pedro luis osorio was a 
member of the medellin police force 
police said osorio was walking to meet a female friend for lunch 
when two men approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire a 
medellin police spokesman said in a telephone interview after 
killing the bodyguard police said the assassins chased down and 
murdered his friend maria ortega five blocks away 
it seems the murders were a result of a personal dispute 
the spokesman said drug traffickers had nothing to do with 
them 
she said the assassins fled and that police had made no arrests 
in connection with the killings 
the bodyguard had been assigned to protect luis bejarano who 
replaced one of the two el espectador managers killed by hired 
hitmen in medellin on oct 10 
hours after the assassinations a man claiming to represent drug 
traffickers said in an anonymous phone call that the remaining 11 
el espectador workers in medellin would be killed if the paper did 
not close the bureau in that city which is the hub of the most 
powerful colombian cocaine cartel 
el tiempo a bogota newspaper published a message from the drug 
dealers tuesday saying they had interpreted a supreme court ruling 
as declaring a colombiaus extratiditon treaty does exist but was 
not signed correctly 
that brought immediate speculation in the local news media that 
the court had struck down possible extraditions 
the state council said that in applying the presidential decree 
on extradition it will remain within the constitutional bounds set 
by the supreme court in its latest ruling 
the council is composed of the president the chief of police 
intelligence the attorney general and the ministers of defense 
interior and justice 
referring to the drug traffickers message in el tiempo the 
council said organized crime is continuing its misinformation 
campaign 
in rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council said 
the government has undertaken a policy of combating drug 
trafficking and its criminal organizations and nowhere in this 
campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with 
traffickers 
no proposal by either drug traffickers or their 
representatives will be accepted 
the traffickers message in el tiempo repeated previous 
proposals it asked for talks with the government to end 
extraditions if the drug dealers agreed to abandon all illicit 
trafficking activities in colombia 
there was a delay in the release of a supreme court ruling oct 
5 and the court released only some parts of its decision 
some lawyers argued the ruling struck down extraditions 
a court comment released after the ruling said there were two 
permissible ways for colombians to be extradited to other 
countries one is through an extradition treaty and when no treaty 
exists the president may use decree powers to permit extradition 
the question of whether a colombianus treaty exists was left 
to the government to decide 
the barco government apparently deciding there is no treaty 
has extradited four people to the united states under the 
presidential decree three were extradited after the oct 5 court 
ruling 
a 1979 extradition treaty was nullified by the supreme court in 
two different rulings because it was not signed by thenpresident 
julio cesar turbay the treaty had been signed by the acting 
president while turbay was out of the country

the mayor announced an internal 
investigation tuesday into how the police department let a 
confessed murderer and mob informant buy drugs carry guns and 
collect welfare while in its custody as a protected witness 
it will be at least the third investigation into the custody and 
death of admitted threetime murderer peter gilbert who died of a 
heart attack in june 1988 while on his way to an unsupervised 
skydiving trip in connecticut 
packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in gilberts 
parachute bag later investigations showed that while in police 
custody gilbert was paid at least 98000 took trips charged 
meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and jewelry at 
taxpayers expense 
mayor joseph r paolino jr who maintains he didnt know 
gilbert was in department custody said his action was prompted by 
outrageous revelations of recent weeks including reports that 
a police officer was videotaped joking with gilbert about the free 
ride they were getting 
paolino appointed family court judge susan mcguirl to conduct 
the review 
us attorney lincoln c almond who has turned down repeated 
requests for grand jury inquiry saying the matter lacks federal 
jurisdiction recused his office from further involvement last week 
after learning a woman who is now a secretary in his office had 
traveled to florida with a police officer who was supervising 
gilbert on one of his seven trips there 
the providence journalbulletin reported saturday that gilberts 
wife had a videotape of a police officer joking with her husband 
about the free ride they were getting 
gilberts wife debra told the newspaper the tape shows 
detective steven cross with his arm around her husbands shoulders 
saying the criminal justice system has been good to us peter 
huh 
gilbert responded by hoisting a soda in a toast and thanking 
former attorney general arlene violet 
wpritv on tuesday night broadcast videotapes of gilbert and 
police officers cavorting at a florida motel swimming pool the 
station said the officers were supposed to have been guarding him 
the tape showed the encounter with cross gilbert also 
videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside lounge chair 
while he was supposed to be guarding the witness the station said 
hard time tough duty gilbert said on the tape as he 
laughed wpritv said the station said cross claimed he was play 
acting to make gilbert feel at ease 
mrs gilbert told the station she gave her husband a gun while 
he was in police custody and that she had one as well as a 
convicted felon gilbert could not legally carry a firearm 
cross was recently transferred from the detective division to 
the auto squad which investigates stolen cars said police officer 
bob lauro 
police chief walter clark has previously declined comment on the 
transfer or the tape and didnt return calls tuesday violet was 
not at her law office tuesday and did not return phone calls 
the us attorneys office recommended an investigation last 
week 
paolino denied any political motivation in requesting the city 
review 
paolino a democrat is expected next year to challenge 
repubican gov edward d diprete who announced a state police 
investigation of the gilbert case last week 
paolino said mcguirls review would be different from the state 
police investigation because it would look into appropriate 
disciplinary actions and administrative changes while the state 
police investigation is looking into possible criminal actions 
im just looking internally as to what happened in the past 
and more fundamentally at the department as a whole said 
mcguirl who will not have subpoena power 
an eightmonth investigation by attorney general james e oneil 
and providence police said police failed to properly supervise 
gilbert but recommended no disciplinary action 
former police chief col anthony j mancuso in charge when 
gilberts protective custody was arranged resigned as head of the 
attorney generals drug force monday saying he did not want to be 
a political pawn 
paolino said he would await mcguirls report before taking any 
disciplinary action 
let the chips fall where they may he said 
police chief walter clark and cmdr richard tamburini who was 
in charge of gilberts supervision did not immediately return 
phone calls tuesday 
two of the officers in the security detail have committed 
suicide 
gilbert 43 was a key witness in two trials and was expected to 
testify against alleged organized crime figures in the 30 months 
he was in police custody gilbert was kept at a police station 
apartment then transferred in january 1988 to a safe house while 
serving a 10year sentence for murder 
paolino who took office in april 1984 said that if the name 
peter gilbert was ever mentioned in my presence it was made with a 
host of other issues and the name would have been meaningless to 
me

safety drills were a weekly occurrence at 
the phillips petroleum co plastics plant but when an emergency 
siren sounded before a series of devastating explosions hundreds 
of employees just ran 
in all 124 were injured 35 hospitalized and at least two died 
in the blasts at the plant monday twentytwo other workers were 
missing and presumed dead on tuesday 
maintenance worker roby clemons said that employees had 20 
seconds to escape after a warning message was broadcast over the 
plants emergency radio 
workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud 
the explosion that followed knocked them off their feet 
each area has an evacuation area but in some cases you just 
run we just ran theres nothing you can do but run said lonnie 
ogden a plant worker for 14 years 
the explosion sent pieces of metal and concrete flying through 
the air he said 
i dove underneath a frontend loader until i didnt see 
anything else coming down it was bad i heard a big hiss then i 
seen a cloud i knew something was wrong something like that 
happens so quick you cant do anything about it 
the plant tested its emergency alarm system every monday 
officials said the alarms had been tested in the morning before 
mondays blast and there were no problems said greg derrick a 
phillips spokesman in bartlesville okla 
alex diaz a general maintenance employee said the plant had an 
evacuation plan but the volume of mondays accident rendered it 
obsolete 
just the size of it you just have to get out of there 
phillips spokesman jere smith said he did not know when the last 
evacuation plan was practiced 
according to elizabeth gonzalez a deputy coordinator of the 
pasadena emergency management office the phillips plant was the 
scheduled site for an annual emergency drill scheduled for nov 8 
its an annual drill and we were working on some of the areas 
we identified as deficiencies in our 1988 drill elements of 
triage and communications she said 
we take safety very seriously i cant explain at this time 
what happened down there said bill stoltz phillips 
environmental director were awaiting getting in there to make a 
full assessment on that 
crews of nearby chemical plants as well as fire departments from 
houston pasadena deer park and laporte responded to mondays 
accident they were among various firefighting crews from 96 
factories and six cities in the area that formed a collective 
emergency response plan in 1955 in the wake of major accidents and 
fires along the houston ship channel 
one such accident was a 1947 explosion in which a freighter 
carrying fertilizer blew up at a texas city dock killing 512

only nine people remained unaccounted for 
tuesday one week after northern californias ravaging earthquake 
and geologists predicted a 5050 chance by christmas of a major 
aftershock capable of causing considerable damage 
the us geological survey on tuesday also revised upward the 
magnitude of the oct 17 quake from 69 to 71 on the richter 
scale 
church bells tolled at 504 pm one week to the minute after 
the quake and 83 minutes later at 627 pm the strongest 
aftershock in four days with a richter scale reading of 45 
rattled the area there were no immediate reports of damage 
a 285 billion quake aid bill passed the us house 
survivor buck helms condition improved to serious with his 
kidney function reported normal 
demolition crews were taking down sections of interstate 880 in 
oakland for fear stillstanding sections of the elevated 
doubledeck structure could tumble like dominoes onto the 1mile 
stretch that collapsed in the oct 17 quake 
the death toll rose to 63 with a coroners discovery of a 39th 
victim among the remains dug out of the rubble of i880 which was 
thefirst elevated freeway built in california 
but authorities have been able to account for all but nine of 
the 280 reported missing during the last week california highway 
patrol lt kris wraa said 
im not willing to speculate how many of those nine missing 
people may or may not be up there wraa said referring to the 
collapsed freeway 
rescue crews have not been able to locate other bodies in the 
rubble where 55 cars were trapped at rushhour a number 
considered well below a normal tuesday possibly because of the 
scheduled third game of the world series between the bay areas two 
major league baseball teams 
a traffic officer reported he was surprised at how light 
traffic was five minutes before the quake california highway 
patrol spokesman thomas a noble said 
four sections remain inaccessible to searchers digging was to 
resume when the threatening sections were taken down possibly by 
thursday there was no hope of finding anyone alive authorities 
said 
the people that are unaccounted for i believe are 
responsible people many of their cars have been found on that 
interchange and for whatever reason their loved ones have not had 
contact with them oakland police sgt greg hughes said 
weve sent officers out to check their homes check their 
jobs and every four hours were talking to the families he said 
seismologists at the geological survey said they revised the 
quakes richter reading to 71 after checking data from 18 seismic 
stations around the world 
the original magnitude of 69 was based on more localized 
seismic readings said waverly person director of the usgs 
national earthquake information service in golden colo in a 
statement 
the usgs issued a longrange aftershock forecast predicting over 
the next two months an 11 percent chance of a temblor of magnitude 
60 or larger and a 50 percent chance of one registering 50 or 
larger 
on the richter scale of earthquake magnitude 50 is considered 
capable of considerable damage and 60 capable of severe damage 
state emergency coordinators have said that an aftershock of 50 
could be especially troublesome to buildings already damaged or 
weakened by the initial earthquake 
the probabilities were based on statistics for california 
earthquakes and not on actual measurements at the san andreas 
fault usgs geophysicist jim luetgert said 
more than 3500 aftershocks some almost imperceptible had been 
detected by tuesday morning the usgs said 
the strong aftershock tuesday evening was centered 14 miles 
northeast of santa cruz the usgs said the aftershock was the 
largest since the 46 aftershock that occurred about 915 pm 
saturday said pat jorgenson of the usgs 
it felt pretty sharp and fairly long but i guess it lasted 
only seven to 10 seconds said santa cruz police dispatcher chuck 
minuti we had a few phone calls right away but no reports of 
damage 
engineers reported tuesday that the toppled 50foot section of 
the bay bridge was unrepairable officials for the transportation 
department said they hope to put up a new fivelane section on the 
lifeline across san francisco bay by nov 16 
commuters left without the bridge and several stretches of 
freeway fared well again tuesday using public transit in record 
numbers transportation officials said 
gov george deukmejian speaking to business leaders praised 
efforts to reduce traffic and warned against lapsing into regular 
cummuting patterns weve got some longterm concerns here he 
said 
in washington the house voted 32199 to send 285 billion in 
earthquakerelief funds to northern california the senate was 
expected to concur wednesday and send the legislation to president 
bush 
in a floor speech before the vote rep nancy pelosi who 
represents san franciscos marina district pleaded for a chance 
to rebuild 
she said we were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive 
power of world war ii including the atomic bomb 
san francisco mayor art agnos called on the federal government 
to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to 500000 from 
100000 reflecting high housing costs in the region 
onehundred thousand dollars in south carolina can make a big 
difference it doesnt here agnos said 
in san francisco alone 750 to 1000 buildings need extensive 
repair agnos told the citycounty board of supervisors on monday 
he estimated damage in the city at 22 billion to 32 billion 
clyde walthall spokesman for pacific gas amp electric said the 
utility estimates theyll need to replace about 10 miles of gas 
distribution lines in the hardhit marina district at an estimated 
cost of 10 million 
he did not know how long that work would take and said the 
utility was awaiting clearance from the city before beginning the 
work 
about 5100 customers are without gas service in the district 
and that about 1000 customers are also without electric service 
walthall said 
fire officials reported five homes were evacuated on monday and 
tuesday when heavy rains caused landslides in the santa cruz 
mountain communities of zayante and boulder creek no injuries were 
reported 
since the quake as many as 90 homeowners around zayante made 
the common sense decision to leave their uninhabitable homes 
without being ordered to evacuate said ken boynton district fire 
chief some of the houses slid and leaned against trees while 
others were reduced to rubble 
already damage from the quake estimated at more than 7 
billion has surpassed hurricane hugo as the costliest disaster in 
us history 
deukmejian said he would call a special legislative session 
within two weeks to work out the states response to the 
devastation 
documents on file at the state transportation department in 
sacramento show that i880 opened in july 1957 at a construction 
cost of 102 million was the first elevated freeway in california 
a nearly identical roadway built soon after the embarcadero in 
san francisco probably will be closed until june due to earthquake 
damage unlike its neartwin in oakland this structure will be 
repaired rather than replaced 
along the pacific coastline near san francisco rocks continued 
to fall of cliffs damaged by the earthquake making the beaches 
below unsafe the usgs said 
there are many cracks along the tops of coastal bluffs and 
some of these could collapse without warning the agency said 
about a halfdozen wineries in the santa cruz region reported a 
jumble of 500pound wine barrels that rolled off madly leaping 
racks stacked to the ceiling some lost precious bottles from their 
wine library the collection all wineries have of every vintage 
produced

the president of the asian development bank was 
quoted tuesday as saying the fund is preparing new loans for china 
which lost its access to lowinterest western cash after its 
crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
the official xinhua news agency quoted bank president masao 
fujioka as telling premier li peng that the bank and china should 
cooperate 
the asian development bank is making active preparations for 
some loan projects with china and these will soon be handed over 
to the board of directors for discussion xinhua paraphrased 
fujioka as saying no details of the loans were given 
china has lost other sources of lowinterest loans since june 
when the chinese army cracked down on prodemocracy demonstrators 
several western governments froze new development loans to china in 
protest and the united states and other countries pressured the 
world bank to freeze its loans 
although world bank president barber conable has said he expects 
to see the bank resume new loans soon bank members delayed voting 
on the matter at a september meeting 
many private foreign bankers are hesitating to make new loans 
because of chinas economic problems and its decision to slow 
industrial growth 
however there have several signs that the financial freeze is 
ending 
japan has said it will begin gradually resuming aid projects 
that it froze in june in addition west germany recently decided 
to go ahead with a 239 million lowinterest loan to china that 
will help build a subway in shanghai 
fujioka and more than 30 foreign bankers were in beijing to 
attend a conference on policies for poor countries

workers detected high levels of methane 
at the william station mine four days before an explosion there 
killed 10 men a state inspector testified tuesday 
the air was 6 percent methane in one section of the mine when 
tested sept 9 but the high level of gas alone does not explain 
the blast said billy smith an inspector for the kentucky 
department of mines and minerals 
you had a 6 percent level on saturday before the explosion 
smith said that is an explosive level and it didnt explode 
youve got to have an ignition source 
workers adjusted fireproof curtains to allow more air into the 
mine assigned a miner to monitor the methane level while they 
worked and warned incoming crews of the high gas levels before the 
blast smith said at a state hearing on the sept 13 explosion the 
worst us mining disaster since 1984 
methane is considered explosive in levels of from 5 percent to 
15 percent 
four of the bodies were found in the area where miners had 
detected the high methane levels smith said 
workers in the section of the mine where the blast occurred were 
dismantling a longwall mining machine mining in that area had been 
completed sept 6 
ron siler president of pyro mining co the mine owner said 
officials did not learn until after the explosion of the high 
methane reading 
at the time of the explosion we were depending on the men in 
the area to take their own measurements siler said during 
questioning from charles moore an attorney representing miners 
widows 
testimony indicated investigators are considering several 
possible causes for the accumulation of methane including water 
that blocked the mines primary ventilation system and a regulator 
or curtain that no longer was being used to allow air to flow 
through the mine 
what ignited the blast has not been established among the 
sources under investigation were electrical equipment acetylene 
torches believed to have been in use before the explosion and rock 
falls that might have sparked wire rope cables 
under questioning from an attorney for the department of mines 
and minerals mine superintendent michael mcdowell said workers 
were randomly searched before going into the mine and terminated if 
found to be carrying cigarettes 
david steele general superintendent at william station 
testified a cigarette butt had been found found in the area of the 
explosion but willard stanley commissioner for the kentucky mines 
department said the cigarette was not found near the bodies and he 
did not believe it sparked the blast 
there were 330 workers underground at the time of the explosion 
siler said

amerindian insurgents angry about a 
government peace accord with rival bush negro rebels hijacked a 
ferryboat tuesday witnesses said 
no hostages were taken but the hijacking on the saramacca river 
temporarily cut off this capital from the riceproducing nickerie 
district rice is a leading earner of hard currency in this country 
on the eastern shoulder of south america 
witnesses said the hijackers were tucayana indians who have 
been agitating against the government since it signed a july peace 
agreement with rebels of the jungle commando group who are mostly 
bush negroes 
on aug 31 the tucayana hijacked a ferry at the same place the 
boat seized tuesday replaced the one captured in august 
like the army the tucayana oppose the peace accord because it 
calls for the 200 to 400 jungle commando fighters to become a 
special police unit in the interior where most of the amerindians 
live 
the amerindians allied to the army during the threeyear 
guerrilla war fear retribution if they fall under the control of 
the bush negroes 
the 65000 bush negroes who are descendants of escaped african 
slaves and 10000 amerindians are traditional rivals they compete 
for land for farming hunting and fishing

egon krenz warned east germans on tuesday to stop 
street demonstrations but up to 12000 marched in east berlin 
after dark to protest his election as president police directed 
traffic out of their way 
the ritual election by the customarily docile parliament was 
made dramatic when some members voted no for the first time 
in a speech afterward krenz said continuing weeks of 
prodemocracy protest could cause a worsening of the situation 
or confrontation 
at nightfall lines of east berliners carrying candles marched 
through the central district chanting egon who sked us a 
recurring phrase since krenz became communist party chief last week 
and we are the competition 
police did not interfere and kept the route clear of traffic 
adn the official news agency reported the protest without 
criticism several thousand people mostly youths carried 
banners and chanted slogans denouncing the election and demanding 
changes in the election laws more democracy and an open press 
it said 
it estimated the number of marchers in the twohour protest as 
as high as 12000 at times 
on monday in leipzig more than 300000 people marched in the 
largest protest of the nations 40year history 
after his election krenz reaffirmed east germanys allegiance 
to communist orthodoxy despite the reform sweeping through the 
soviet bloc he also promised to investigate charges of police 
brutality against prodemocracy demonstrators earlier this month 
the new leader who succeeded erich honecker as communist party 
chief and president was in charge of police at the time 
officials admitted for the first time tuesday that police 
attacked peaceful protesters in a report carried by the official 
news agency the government said there were instances where 
security officials exceeded their authority and illegal acts were 
committed against some of those detained 
adn said officials decided police should use restraint unless 
there is violence or the threat of violence and had prohibited 
the use of firearms 
it said police commanders had apologized to victims of 
verifiable brutality adn said 83 complaints were under review and 
prosecutors had taken up four cases according to the report 
prepared by the parliament committees on national defense and 
justice affairs 
krenz said in his speech proper steps will be taken if the 
evidence warrants them anyone who was treated unjustly has the 
right to take advantage of their legal rights 
twentysix members of the 500seat peoples chamber voted 
against krenz for president although he was the only candidate 
and 26 abstained adn reported 
it was the first time members of the communistcontrolled 
chamber had voted against the sole candidate for president 
after his election the 52yearold leader declared to the 
legislators 
demonstrations however peacefully they may be planned and 
thought out carry within themselves the danger of ending in a 
different way from how they started 
that is unsettling to many people and rightly so our 
society which has so many new things to tackle is thus put under 
increasing tension 
in bonn west germany chancellor helmut kohl said tuesday he 
was prepared to meet with east germanys new leader to advance 
intergerman relations 
if it is seen as useful by both sides from my side there 
are no difficulties in the way of a wellprepared meeting taking 
place kohl told reporters in bonn 
east berlins official news agency swiftly reported the summit 
offer 
krenz and his colleagues have said they will exclude the growing 
opposition from talks about change in a system whose rigidity has 
caused tens of thousands of east germans to flee and hundreds of 
thousands to protest the communist leadership says there already 
are enough officially recognized groups in which to discuss 
necessary changes 
renewal of society requires the strong socialist foundation 
which was put in place in a joint effort krenz said 
opposition groups have released written statements from 
witnesses and victims describing brutal treatment by police during 
protests and while people were in custody 
many victims said they were forced to stand naked for hours in 
frigid holding cells 
others reported being beaten and humiliated by officers after 
street protests oct 78 in east berlin police used clubs to 
disperse the demonstrators and arrested hundreds 
on tuesday krenz said he would seek new impulses for 
possible change from president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet 
union who champions reform during a forthcoming visit to moscow 
representatives of several hundred workers at the wilhelm pieck 
electronics factory said in a statement monday they had organized 
an independent labor union called reform that demands the right to 
strike and to set wages and prices at the factory 
on tuesday adn denied such a union had been formed 
party leaders are expected to oppose independent unions that 
could gain widespread support and challenge the communist monopoly 
on power as occurred with solidarity in neighboring poland

winery worker ramon salcido pleaded 
innocent tuesday to charges he killed his wife two of his 
daughters and four other people in a rampage last spring 
salcido appeared before sonoma county superior judge j brian 
jamar who accepted the plea and tentatively scheduled salcidos 
trial for jan 30 
however public defender marteen miller said he needed more time 
to prepare and would probably request a delay in the start of the 
trial 
miller said he was preparing motions to move the trial to 
another county because of news coverage and to challenge salcidos 
reported confession in mexico salcido a native of mexico was 
arrested there several days after the april 14 rampage in the wine 
country north of san francisco 
if convicted salcido could be sentenced to death miller said 
he would argue that the extradition treaty between the united 
states and mexico forbids such a sentence 
salcido is charged in the slayings of his wife angela two of 
their three daughters his wifes mother two of his wifes 
sisters and a coworker at grand cru vineyards 
the victims were shot stabbed and beaten a third daughter 
3yearold carmina had her throat slashed like the other two but 
survived she was found alive in the garbage dump where the 
youngsters bodies had been dumped

workers removed an earthquakedamaged 
section of the lower deck of the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
on tuesday leaving a hole in the structure nearly as glaring as 
the hole in the regions transportation system 
fiftyfoot sections one atop the other have now been yanked 
out of both levels of the doubledecked 53yearold bridge 
officials for the california department of transportation will 
build new sections each five lanes wide and lift them into place 
they estimate the work will take at least one month 
steve saville a spokesman for the department said he believed 
it was the first time such large pieces had been removed since the 
major highway link between the cities opened in 1936 
its a big hole he said 
for bay area residents who escaped injury or property damage 
the closure of the bridge may be the biggest inconvenience of the 
earthquake saville said the bridge is normally used by 260000 
cars each day the state is losing an estimated 130000 a day in 
tolls 
the 200ton lower section had been declared a total loss shortly 
after the oct 17 earthquake it was chopped into four pieces and 
lowered more than 200 feet by crane to a barge floating next to a 
bridge tower in san francisco bay 
transportation department officials had hoped to repair the 
upper section and undertook a delicate twoday effort to lower 
that section last weekend the upper section was cut into just two 
pieces and lowered but a close inspection showed the steel 
framework could not be salvaged saville said 
the repairs will cost 1 million the agency has said 
department planners had accounted for the possibly the upper 
section would be unusable and had already drafted a design for new 
construction so the repair time estimate did not have to be 
extended saville said 
the 85milelong bridge had become the symbol of the world 
series between oakland and san francisco 
nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge with the 
upper deck dangling provided the first graphic illustration of the 
magnitude of the 71 richter scale quake one woman died when she 
drove her car into the gap

the pennsylvania house of representatives 
on tuesday passed a tough abortion control bill intended to make 
the state the first to take advantage of a us supreme court 
ruling allowing more restrictions 
after nearly nine hours of debate the house voted 14358 for 
the new controls and sent the bill to the senate which recessed 
earlier tuesday and will not return until nov 13 most attempts to 
weaken the bill were easily defeated during the long session 
gov robert p casey has said he backs abortion restrictions 
proposed by republican state rep stephen freind the states 
leading antiabortion lawmaker who opened debate on the house 
floor by calling abortion an inherently violent act 
he asked his fellow lawmakers abortion is the most wrenching 
social issue of our time but since when do we solve our social 
problems with violence 
freind called the bill a moderate common sense approach to 
this issue earlier tuesday also by a 14358 vote the house 
approved adding the abortion control language into a pending bill 
toughening penalties for incest a prochoice leader democratic 
state rep karen ritter argued during debate that the government 
has no right to intrude on a womans decision whether to have an 
abortion 
she said restrictions proposed by freind trivialize one of the 
most important decisions a woman can make why cant we trust a 
woman to make the decision when to have a child 
pennsylvania legislators have repeatedly voted for abortion 
controls since the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
made most abortions legal efforts to impose new restrictions 
started anew after july when the supreme court cleared the way in 
a missouri case for states to impose new restrictions on abortion 
the antiabortion proposals under consideration in pennsylvania 
include a ban on abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except 
in cases where the mother faces irreversible harm and a 
prohibition on abortions for sex selection others include a 
requirement that women inform their husbands if they plan to get an 
abortion and a 24hour waiting period 
weve lost amendments in the past and we may lose some 
amendments today but i think well pass the bill freind said 
the american civil liberties union of pennsylvania called 
freinds measure the most dangerous abortion bill in any state 
legislature in the nation 
ms ritter said there was an outside chance of swinging enough 
votes to defeat it 
were not giving up hope on it yet she said 
the florida legislature called into special session by gov bob 
martinez recently rejected all of his proposed abortion 
restrictions last week a committee of the illinois house blocked 
a bill to restrict abortions

one night recently police raided several 
bars in beirut and arrested a dozen people for various violations 
law enforcement still exists in beirut but just barely 
for years lebanons 7000man police force has been a virtual 
bystander in the civil war and the feuds between heavily armed 
militias powerless to stanch the lawlessness that has engulfed the 
country since 1975 
but since a ceasefire sept 22 halted the most recent fighting 
between syrians and christians the police have slowly begun 
enforcing the law again 
were like the turtle it moves slowly but in the end when 
no one expects it it gets to where its going said col nabil 
alzein a senior aide to beiruts chief of detectives brig gen 
issam abu zaki 
as the war dragged on killings robberies kidnappings and drug 
abuse went virtually unchecked there have been 60000 bank 
holdups since 1975 according to police statistics 
much of this was the work of the unruly militias who maintained 
their own rough justice usually summary executions for those who 
violated their rules 
but ordinary street crime was also rampant fueled by a sharply 
deteriorating economy lebanon long a major source of hashish and 
lately heroin became a thriving domestic market as wartraumatized 
youngsters turned to drugs 
lebanons prisons and courts ceased to function years ago 
militiamen have emptied the prisons many times over freeing 
friends and relatives and leaving the gates open for other inmates 
an estimated 7000 murderers rapists gunmen and thieves have 
been freed this way since 1975 
but in beirut at least the police are hitting back 
in may amid the syrianchristian battles 30 gunmen freed 189 
inmates from the central prison in moslem west beirut killing a 
police sergeant 
most were recaptured by police and headquarters ordered the 
arrest of the gunmen hiding out with the militias in the mountains 
in midoctober a patrol spotted one of the raiders in west beirut 
he was shot and killed when he tried to pull a gun 
the police force comprises a detectives division vice riot and 
traffic squads a police academy and units of gendarmes who operate 
in the countryside 
though all the fighting the police force has remained intact 
with moslem and christian officers cooperating with each other 
something rarely seen nowadays in lebanon 
the state treasury pays police salaries but it has been unable 
to finance new recruits since 1986 
abu zaki the detective chief said public support for the 
police has reawakened in recent weeks he noted that anonymous 
telephone tipoffs have helped round up scores of drug traffickers 
and users 
were getting hundreds of such tips now the number grows 
every day he said 
one of the main police functions in recent years has been 
keeping statistics of the violence and casualties 
but the police still have a long way to go before theyll be 
able to regain the authority police departments in other countries 
take for granted 
every morning sgt naji abuhaidar puts on his khaki uniform 
climbs on his 25yearold harley davidson motorcycle and roars off 
into beiruts chaotic traffic 
he hands out tickets to violators cools down hottempered cab 
drivers and tries to unsnarl the clogged streets 
but when militiamen start shooting at each other often over 
nothing more than who gets served first at a gasoline station sgt 
abuhaidar looks the other way 
after 14 years of war he knows the rules of survival 
ill be retiring in a couple of years he said and i

in a case of cable spoofing art the usa network 
tonight is airing the hollywood detective a sly comedy about a 
oncefamous tv detective fallen on hard times it stars telly 
savalas 
savalas of course didnt fall on hard times when cbs axed his 
kojak series in 1978 hes even returning to television nov 4 
as the tough new york cop in a new kojak part of abcs 
saturday mystery series 
but usas movie does make you think particularly at one point 
when a reporter asks savalas faded tv detective middleaged actor 
harry bell the name and network of his old tv series 
the faded star beams oh yes he casually says john 
crowne private investigator nbc you know there is talk 
recently about renewing the series and i two real police 
detectives hustle him away 
a funny moment savalas is wonderful in it and throughout the 
film he shows a previously unseen comic side playing a ham who 
made millions in eight years as a tv detective but hasnt worked in 
12 years 
although our hero visibly inflates when someone recognizes him 
he now lives alone unloved and unemployed in his personal tap 
city an ancient hollywood bungalow surrounded by dry weeds 
detective vaguely echoes a nifty art carneylily tomlin 
movie of 1977 the late show complete with a flakey hollywood 
lady sweetly portrayed here by helen udy but its gently funny in 
its own way 
the twohour film concerns give or take a missingpersons case 
that our hero reluctantly accepts aware that hes no detective 
but he also is aware he needs money bills are piling up his 
stove was repossessed and he hasnt even a hot plate on which to 
warm his dinner a can of tamales still he remains a ham even 
with cold tamales 
up for a small part as an irish priest in a tv movie at 
universal studios he recalls in his gumshoemovie narration that 
the studio had been good to me once and i figured i owed them 
onenope the network says 
his sleazy agent nicely played by george coe a fan of porn 
movies says he could land him the lead in a new personal 
picture called author of lust throttling coe the enraged 
actor shouts the worst insult he can muster you agent you 
but when all seems lost there is a knock on his door the 
knocker udy is a young woman lois wednesday like some hollywood 
inmates she is not what network executives would call 
realitybased 
this is not just because her hair has tints of purple and blue 
the number of her apartment is 1412 and her phone is shaped 
like a tennis shoe no it is because she thinks harry bell the 
actor really can solve a case 
the case is her missing boyfriend they met had a fling and 
then he kinda sorta moved in she explains in her wistful wispy 
voice but he has disappeared leaving behind 10000 in cash 
harry bell actor explains that he is no detective however 
with the chance of earning 100 a day plus expenses he thinks 
that maybe just maybe being a real detective wasnt much 
different than being one on tv 
he soon learns that there is a small difference as he goes 
through plot twists involving medflies blackmail the hollenbeck 
fruit company a car chase his arrest as a murder suspect and a 
oncegreat tv story consultant he summons when the case gets too 
baffling 
there also are two stiffs 
while the proceedings sag slightly near the gunfirefilled 
finale this detective wellwritten by christopher crowe and 
deftly directed by kevin connor is a fine and funny film youll 
like it

in laboratories around the world researchers 
are developing weapons to defend against lifes biggest killers 
they look for major steps forward in the 1990s this is one of a 
periodic series of articles the 90s looking ahead o the 
promise and peril of the upcoming decade in the environment 
medicine technology and society 
</TEXT>

two big killers will count their victims in the millions in the 
1990s 13 million american lives claimed by heart disease and 
cancer if the current fatality rate continues 
but medical researchers hope to strike some telling blows 
against these deadliest enemies in the coming decade they dont 
expect cures instead they look for new insights to help them 
attack the diseases from many directions 
better understanding of cancercausing genes and how to block 
them for example and of cancersuppressing genes and how to 
harness them would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to 
wield against cancer which will kill an estimated 500000 
americans this year 
and new discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart 
disease might lead to innovative treatments for the nations 
leading killer cause of 767000 american deaths in 1988 about 
onethird of the deaths from all causes 
just about everybody has heard about eating right to avoid high 
levels of cholesterol in the blood cholesterol can promote 
atherosclerosis a narrowing of the arteries that sets the stage 
for heart attacks 
but in the next decade we may learn that what you eat is more 
important than just what it does to your cholesterol said rodman 
starke the american heart associations senior vice president for 
scientific affairs 
we are beginning to see glimmers of evidence that some 
dietary substances may affect atherosclerosis risk independently of 
any impact on cholesterol he said they may also promote blood 
clotting which can cause heart attacks when it occurs in narrowed 
arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle he said 
scientists may also find better ways to prevent heart attacks as 
they learn more details about what triggers them in people with 
atherosclerosis said james willerson chairman of the heart 
associations research committee 
he also said researchers may find a way to identify people at 
risk for sudden cardiac death a lethal disruption of the hearts 
pumping rhythm and develop better techniques to prevent it 
other potential developments starke or willerson suggested for 
the 1990s include 
greater understanding of the complex events that produce 
atherosclerosis perhaps leading to treatments to reverse or avoid 
it 
improved clotdissolving drugs to stop heart attacks 
researchers would like to reduce side effects confine the 
anticlotting effect to places where it will do good and stop the 
effect of the drugs when needed to avoid risk of excessive bleeding 
better understanding and possible prevention of a renarrowing 
of atherosclerotic arteries after a procedure called angioplasty is 
used to widen them this occurs in 25 percent to 40 percent of 
patients who go through angioplasty and is a major stumbling block 
to the procedures success willerson said 
as with heart disease some of the advances experts hope for in 
the fight against cancer in the 1990s deal with prevention 
researchers may find genetic tests to identify people at high 
risk for cancer of the colon or breast and probably some other 
common cancers as well said john laszlo the cancer societys 
senior vice president for research 
warnings and instructions about prevention should pack more 
wallop for those people than the blanket recommendations now given 
to everybody he said 
when youre talking about the possibility of changing your 
diet for your lifetime it would be nice to know ahead of time 
whether it would be important for you to do that laszlo said 
another payoff in identifying people at particular risk for 
certain cancers would be the ability to learn more about 
effectiveness of preventive steps said vincent devita former 
national cancer institute director 
if experiments can be focused on people at high risk 
researchers can get better information on how much of a diet or 
lifestyle change is needed and for how long in order to cut 
cancer risk said devita who is physicianinchief at the memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york 
he and laszlo also expect progress in making chemotherapy more 
effective by sabotaging the ability of some cancer cells to resist 
it that could help treatment of many kinds of cancers and 
particularly those of the breast colon and pancreas they said 
among the other possible developments in the 1990s suggested by 
devita or laszlo 
the first experiments in people with antisense dna 
substances designed to block the effect of cancercausing genes 
routine use during chemotherapy of recently discovered 
colonystimulating factors allowing higher doses of medicine the 
substances counter a major side effect of chemotherapy decreases 
in infectionfighting white blood cells 
advances in the use of monoclonal antibodies molecules that 
can seek out and bind to cancer cells to deliver radiation 
treatment or to keep cancer cells from responding to substances 
that spur their growth 
more research into suppressor genes which act to prevent 
development of cancer perhaps the substances they direct cells to 
make can be harnessed to fight cancer devita said 
theoretically it should work and technically theres no 
reason it cant be done he said so stay tuned

when the philadelphia 76ers play their first 
home game this season grover washington jr will be there 
performing the national anthem 
its a tradition and a logical one not just because the 
saxophonist lives in the suburb of germantown or that former 76ers 
star julius erving is a close friend 
musically washington says it makes sense as well thats 
right jazz and basketball riffs and dunks horn charts and game 
plans he can hear it now starting at guard please welcome 
grover washington jr 
we live really parallel lives said washington who even 
wrote a song about erving called let it flow 
we are trying to create whether its on the court or on the 
bandstand or the stage the concept of team play whether you are 
on a basketball team or whether you are in a band 
there are role players on a basketball team and role players 
in a band everybody shifts around everybody gets to handle the 
ball so to speak my role is like the point guard i try to give 
the ball to the people who can really do things with it im also 
like a playercoach 
washington has provided valuable assists to collaborators ralph 
mcdonald ronnie foster donald robinson and others singer bill 
withers got a boost in 1980 when the saxophonist phoned and urged 
him to add vocals to the track of just the two of us a no 2 
hit off the platinum winelight album winner of the best jazz 
fusion performance grammy 
on time out of my mind his 21st album he offers 
encouragement to the 1990 transantarctic expedition explorers with 
protect the dream sports crept in again as washington 
explained why he was supporting those inspecting environmental 
conditions around the antarctic 
when i think of those guys on foot and on skis going across 
antartica i realize all that is really for all of us he said 
they come back with information and the ball will be in our 
court there are a lot of concerned people around that will take 
the advice and the facts they will be finding out 
washington sees his own work as information short stories 
without words impressions often first impressions turned into 
sound the titles are a clue gramercy park a melodic james 
mcbridedamon duewhite composition about the historic section of 
manhattan or the romantic unspoken love written by gerald 
veasley 
the title track a hit for steely dan is a gesture of thanks to 
the jazzrock group 
every time i get in my car and ride to new york its either 
gaucho or nightfly washington said of the steely dan record 
and group member donald fagens solo album 
plus with that group theyve been some of the guys on the 
cutting edge of entertaining they talk about religion the 
third world they talk about glamour how living hard will take its 
toll 
washington likes a pace as relaxed as his own sweet saxophone 
that means time with his wife christine and children shana bly 
and grover iii jam sessions are balanced by parents night at 
school it makes for a richer life and better records he says 
through the things i do every day i can relate in musical 
terms to my fans let them know we have more similarities than 
differences i am more than a onedimensional person and the 
audience is more than a onedimensional audience 
he was born in 1943 in buffalo ny and was playing sax by age 
10 washingtons career took off in 1970 when he was featured on 
johnny hammond smiths breakout and arranged the cover of 
carole kings its too late his first solo record the 
acclaimed inner city blues came by accident when he wound up 
doing a solo intended for tenor saxophonist hank crawford who 
couldnt make the studio date at the last minute 
the title track is a cover of marvin gayes haunting meditation 
on urban life appropriate since gaye and another personal 
favorite of washingtons stevie wonder have often incorporated 
jazz into their own work 
jazz greats charlie parker sonny rollins cannonball adderley 
and john coltrane are important influences washington also 
incorporates classical music and sounds from south america europe 
africa and japan 
but he thinks locally as well as globally he doesnt need to 
travel 5000 miles for inspiration just walking down the street is 
enough 
theres a record player playing in here all the time he 
said pointing to his head im listening to everything the 
screech of brakes three or four people walking and you can hear 
their heels clicking railroad tracks 
any kind of movement birds wings theres a lot of things to 
be learned just by picking up on the subtle things that really 
present the whole musical picture

playfully and masterfully julia child sedto the kitchen in the 1960s 
now finally she iuced 
america ins back 
seasoned oh so slightly by the health fanatics but as spicy and 
devoted to the joys of the table as ever 
to much of america she is the french chef they know and love 
trilling bon appetit at the close of her landmark tv cooking 
lessons and willing to be a little like us by occasionally dropping 
a piece of chicken live on television and putting it back in the 
pan 
mastering the art of french cooking in two volumes became 
manus cooks and julia child became etched in our 
datory for serioculture her voice her 6foot2 frame and her funny charming 
presence even noncooks know dan aykroyds parody on saturday 
night live she found it terribly funny 
now at 77 she has published her seventh and she says last 
book with the nononsense title the way to cook and a 
nononsense price of 50 with more than 800 recipes in 511 pages 
it weighs in at a very serious 5 pounds it is the first cookbook 
chosen as a main selection by book of the month club 
i felt it was time for a new book and a new look she said 
in a recent interview mastering was very classical french no 
deviating at all 
the way deviates blending classic technique with freestyle 
american cooking 
aimed at a generation for whom cooking may mean lean cuisine 
in the microwave the way to cook includes such things as 
chinese manicotti which she calls an italosino conversation 
piece and unusually good eating 
but this is by no means a new world of food while there are 
plenty of lowfat recipes theres no shortage of butter or cream 
or the egg that perfect pristine primal object we may not 
gobble it up as profusely now as we used to but every mouthful 
should be memorable 
and that is the essence of her attitude toward the fervor over 
healthy eating give up nothing eat with pleasure but in 
moderation 
she bemoans the loss of those happy days in the 60s when 
everyone ate butter and cream oh they were lovely days 
child says she has had to watch her weight for the last 35 years 
i am very careful about my fat content and calories and eat 
much smaller portions i am conscious of not wanting to be a mrs 
6by6 
but that does not mean a lack of good food or good company 
the main thing is getting people together said child who 
first learned to cook so she could feed her husband i get very 
depressed when i dont eat well and that doesnt mean fancy 
americans approach to food these days has her worried 
whats dangerous and discouraging about this era is that 
people really are afraid of their food sitting down to dinner is a 
trap not something to enjoy people should take their food more 
seriously learn what you can eat and enjoy it thoroughly 
in a discussion of the nutrients in vegetables she writes of 
nervous nutritional nellies who boil sprouts or green beans in 
a small covered pan rather than lots of water the results she 
writes are invariably unappetizing inedible and a dull 
graygreen one reason i am sure that many people hate vegetables 
is because theyre cooked like medicine but fresh vegetables are 
glorious food 
child is foremost a teacher though she says she would have been 
happy as a butcher and is proud of her puff pastry method and of 
the work shes done with poultry and bread 
in the way to cook published this month by alfred a knopf 
child teaches the book is demanding but accessible without 
recipes like the daunting 13 pages for french bread in the second 
volume of mastering 
the color photographs show the food as the cook sees it and 
there are plenty of them nine for example show stepbystep how 
to truss a chicken and nine take the cook from a pile of butter 
and flour to puff pastry 
its really sort of a distillation of her whole career said 
peter kump of kumps new york cooking school shes expressing 
herself more clearly more ably in a way that i think is just 
superlative 
and like a great teacher child anticipates questions when she 
suggests creaming butter with a wooden spoon she adds you can 
use a handheld mixer but its such a nuisance to scrape the 
butter out of the blades 
recipes are grouped unconventionally by technique so for 
example pork and veal chops are together rather than pork chops 
and pork roast the croutons for fish soups are with the soups not 
the breads there are master recipes and then variations 
i want to encourage them to think of their own ways child 
said and while she has little patience for fads its as though 
people didnt dare do anything traditional the master recipe 
method allows for adding the trendy ingredient de jour 
modern appliances like the food processor are used but child 
has not been won over to the microwave oven which she uses for 
defrosting rewarming or starting dishes but leaves her too little 
control over actual cooking 
she does however suggest using a blowtorch a blowtorch 
a blowtorch is not just for laughs it is a legitimate 
kitchen tool and marvelous for loosening aspics from their 
molds she even suggests what kind to buy

transplant surgeons expect to be able to 
replace almost every part of the human body during the 1990s but 
they fear such medical feats will have little impact unless more 
people donate organs 
i see another decade of progress equal to the last decade but 
that wont happen until we figure out the organ donor problem a 
little bit better said the university of iowas dr robert 
corry president of the united network for organ sharing 
organ donation has been at a standstill the past few years 
despite laws requiring hospitals to discuss the subject with 
relatives of braindead patients 
one of the goals is that one of these days organ donation will 
be viewed as commonplace as giving blood said linda sheaffer 
director of the federal division of organ transplantation 
can we achieve that in the 1990s im just not sure she 
said 
doctors hope to ease the crunch in 90s by transplanting animal 
organs into humans such a crossspecies transplant has not been 
attempted since 1984 when california surgeons put a baboons heart 
into a 12dayold girl she died 20 days later 
advances also are expected in the quest for artificial organs 
especially heart assist devices that can be implanted permanently 
less flashy but no less important are efforts to attain 
longterm transplantation success without antirejection drugs that 
suppress the patients entire immune system and to extend the 
shelf life of donated organs 
doctors are working to perfect pancreas lung intestinal and 
reproductive organ transplants and to replace limbs with cadaver 
parts 
about the only irreplaceable part seems to be the brain 
its a question of identity said transplant pioneer dr 
thomas starzl of the university of pittsburgh if you found a 
body for the brain youd transplant the body to the brain its a 
subtle distinction i wouldnt have any plans for that 
whatever the advances however the donor flow may remain a 
problem 
the whole thing would be revolutionized overnight if you could 
do something about that starzl said when theres a crack in 
that wall its going to be like the atlantic ocean pouring 
through 
studies show almost all americans are aware of organ donation 
and view transplantation favorably but only a slight majority 
express willingness to give loved ones hearts livers kidneys and 
other vital parts so others may live fewer still want their own 
organs donated upon death 
a record 18500plus people are awaiting organ transplants in 
the united states according to the organ network the list grows 
daily as do the number of nagging questions concerning who gets 
what and who pays 
in some respects i think its just as well theres a limited 
supply of donor organs said roger evans a senior research 
scientist at the battelle seattle research center 
when you think of 1647 hearts transplanted in 1988 it 
really is not that big a deal evans said if we had more donor 
organs it would raise more questions of how we can afford to 
offer this technology

to his neighbors john cotter jr was a 
wealthy real estate developer who had it all the son of a retired 
state supreme court chief justice himself the patriarch of an 
elegant family a loving father who took his son hunting 
but inside cotter was tortured by monsters tormented by 
his business failures shattered by the recent discovery that his 
son had epilepsy 
hopelessness overtook him and in the end he shot himself but 
not before taking the lives of his wife son and daughter 
the tragedy recalls other cases in which people bent on killing 
themselves have taken innocents even bystanders with them 
people like joseph wesbecker the former mental patient who in 
september killed nine including himself in a louisville ky 
printing plant rampage 
psychologists and physiologists are only beginning to isolate 
possible reasons for such perplexing behavior besides personal 
pressures that seem unbearable they cite perverse lovehate 
relationships between some killers and victims and in many cases a 
deficiency in a messagecarrying chemical in the brain 
the details of cotters final act provide a dim light down the 
foreboding tunnels of the mind 
there was nothing strange about them said jane 
longleycook a neighbor who was in a car pool with cotters wife 
anne 
mrs cotter 44 was a patron of the arts and a caring mother so 
thoughtful shed hand out trickortreat candy in advance of 
halloween if she was going to be away the daughter julia 21 
graduated from college last spring with a degree in french and 
planned to spend some time in england the son john iii 17 was 
enrolled in a private school 
it probably was the biggest shock of my life mrs 
longleycook said of the july killings in the threestory brick 
house across the street i dont think well ever know what 
causes people to do things like that 
cotter a shy private man of 47 had started seeing a 
psychiatrist about a month before according to police reports he 
indicated to the therapist that he was depressed because of among 
other things financial problems and the illness of his son a 
loner who had few close friends 
about a year earlier the son suffered a seizure while driving 
which led to the discovery he had epilepsy 
the psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressant drugs for 
cotter would not comment on the case but police said he indicated 
cotter never talked about taking his own life let alone killing 
his family just a week or two before the shootings he told the 
therapist his difficulties seemed to be straightening out 
according to investigators 
but apparently pressure began to build in a mind psychiatrists 
say might have crossed the line from reality to exaggeration his 
last thoughts were scribbled on a single page of paper in 
disjointed and unpunctuated notes 
depression 
shaking uncontrollably inside 
destitute 
no hope 
no hope for family 
no good insurance 
epilepsy 
john iii is depressed from tegretol medication to control 
seizures and walks the house at night as i do he worries about 
another seizure and accident becoming a closeted person 
death nervous breakdown depression is everywhere 
the monster shakes my body each night and i wake trembling 
the page ended with a reference to his wife who was mourning 
the recent loss of her mother 
no future no hope suffering for all of us she suffered in 
the past and cant suffer again 
cotter also left an eightpage letter alleging payoffs and the 
mishandling of funds and grants in the connecticut housing finance 
authority which makes loans for projects including lowincome 
housing for the poor while cotter did not implicate himself he 
alleged that the purported scheme to defraud the authority involved 
real estate he had owned the state is investigating 
cotter himself was facing a halfdozen civil suits filed by 
tenants of one of his developments seeking more than 2 million in 
damages from a fire at a probate hearing a judge said cotters 
estate might not be enough to cover his debts 
dr alan l berman a professor of psychology at the american 
university in washington said cotters notes are an expression of 
tremendous anxiety fear or threat he felt and an inability to 
separate himself from his family 
some suicidal people in a twisted state of mind may see those 
they murder as themselves they are so fused so incapable of 
distinguishing that this other person is a separate human being 
the suicidal motive extends to having to kill this other person as 
well said berman 
the most typical murdersuicide is one in which two partners 
depend on and abuse each other for affection in a lovehate 
relationship marked by separations threats and accusations of 
infidelity he said 
they cannot exist separate from each other and they really 
cant live with each other without being abusive so its sort of a 
final act that communicates just that and that is i am so 
despairing because youre threatening to leave me i hate you so 
much and i love you so much i have to take you with me and i have 
to go 
berman told of a baltimore man who shot his lover three times in 
the head then bent over and kissed her before killing himself 
nancy allen a los angeles counselor found in a study of 104 
murdersuicides that 71 percent of the murderers were husbands or 
boyfriends of the victims in half of the cases the couple had 
been drinking 
studies since 1976 link such violent and impulsive behavior to a 
decrease in the chemical called serotonin which carries messages 
between brain cells 
serotonin has been found to be the lowest in 
murdersuicides said dr susan j blumenthal a psychiatrist and 
chief of the behavioral medicine program at the national institute 
of mental health in rockville md its also very low in 
arsonists who then kill themselves or attempt suicide 
some who commit murdersuicide fall victim to depression or 
psychosis unable to distinguish reality from fantasy hearing 
voices telling them to hurt themselves and others they blame 
others including family members or their work supervisors for their 
failures and their hurt often exaggerated in the exhaustion of the 
mind 
these are people who feel helpless in the face of being 
victimized by someone else said dr ronald s ebert senior 
forensic psychologist at mclean hospital in belmont mass

such was the case with wesbecker a 47yearold pressman who was 
put on disability leave last year a manic depressive he had 
attempted suicide three times coworkers said he carried a grudge 
because he was laid off and feared his disability benefits were 
going to be stopped 
youre dealing with a man who perceives a miscarriage of 
justice and hes going to correct it said dr martin symonds 
chairman of the american psychiatric associations task force on 
victimization 
despising what they did unable to live with themselves after 
killing someone particularly someone close many murderers then 
take their own lives 
the national institute of mental healths blumenthal said that 
in over 90 percent of suicides there is some humiliating life event 
in the recent past theres a breakup in a relationship theyve 
lost a job theyve lost some financial status theyre about to be 
confronted by the law 
no one knows for sure what was going through john cotters mind 
that fatal summer day on woodside circle 
i think everybody wishes they knew because you could say 
well it happened because of this and we can put it behind us 
said mrs longleycook a mother of three 
i think thats whats very frightening to chldren they see 
this happy family across the street and then suddenly they hear the 
father murdered everyone and killed himself thats pretty 
devastating for children every time i see the house i just cant 
believe thats happened there

rumor has it thomas pynchon is back in new york 
again preparing to publish a new book unless the tales about him 
tracing the masondixon line or hiding out in latin america are to 
be believed 
most of whats known about the elusive awardwinning author of 
v and the crying of lot 49 is learned through rumor he 
hasnt published a novel in nearly 17 years yet some academics and 
hardcore admirers still rank him among the greatest american 
novelists of the 20th century if only for his 1973 epic 
gravitys rainbow 
in a day of so many ephemeral authors pynchon remains 
relatively unknown virtually unphotographed and as mystifying a 
character as any hes created 
simply put pynchon has a status in american writing that 
william faulkner had in the early part of the century said 
edward mendelson a professor of comparative literature at columbia 
university 
there seems to be a book that every age or generation develops 
to understand its own world gravitys rainbow more than any 
other is the book postwar america can use to understand how it 
got to be the way it is 
pynchon has shunned the public eye since v was published in 
1963 saying whats important is whats on the page when he 
won the national book award in 1973 he sent a comedian professor 
irwin corey to accept it for him he was named a macarthur fellow 
in 1988 but the foundation had trouble figuring out where to send 
the check 
a portrait of pynchon emerges from conversations with several 
friends on whom he has relied for decades yet hasnt contacted in 
five or six years most of them spoke on the condition that their 
names not be used 
the 52yearold cornell university graduate appears to have 
virtually disappeared into the fabric of society moving almost 
free of its burdens with few possessions and never taking a wife 
or a job much as lt tyrone slothrop literally disappears at the 
close of gravitys rainbow 
but unlike the elusive writer jd salinger who withdrew into 
rural new hampshire once he became famous pynchon need not worry 
about being recognized only a handful of people know what he looks 
like 
it isnt something that came to him because he got famous he 
was that way before and why i dont quite know said corlies 
smith who was instrumental in publishing one of pynchons first 
stories in the early 1960s 
smith edited v and gravitys rainbow but in his 
30year association with the author hes seen pynchon only four or 
five times 
he does not wish to be written about one friend said he 
wanted to be known for the writing and not for the story about 
him 
gravitys rainbow has become a benchmark that many 
postworld war ii american novels are measured against the story 
is a dizzyingly entertaining tale of slothrops departure from 
world war ii london and his adventures wandering through 
demilitarized europe searching in part for information on the 
german v2 rockets 
but the novel also deals with mans use of metaphor to organize 
his world and through the arc metaphor that permeates the book as 
it examines history 
a lot of the metaphor is concerned with christmas and advent 
and that seems to equate the rise of history with an upward arc 
to the birth of christ said stephen fix dean of williams 
college there is a transformation there history is desanctified 
and replaced by technology the other side of the arc is 
gravitys rainbow 
but far from the stodgy style one might expect from such an 
endeavor pynchons prose is colored with surrealistic overtones 
and the characters often burst into song like a 1930s musical 
there is a pure goofiness thats matched with this high 
rhetorical voice he can change gears with you on a moments notice 
without that ever feeling false fix said 
equally intriguing is pynchons research into the workings of 
the v2s and such arcane topics as international corporate 
alliances that predated the war past associates said his 
attention to detail led him to travel the masondixon line in the 
early 1980s gathering information for a book on the 18th century

worrying about the threat of global warming 
has become a major preoccupation among environmental groups and 
think tanks but in the scientific community not everyone is quite 
so willing to run for cover 
the greenhouse effect is threatening to raise temperatures 
melt the polar ice caps change climate and generally disrupt 
civilization say those concerned about the hazard 
but others point out that just a decade or so ago similar 
warnings were being issued that the world was headed into another 
ice age 
many weather researchers hesitate to pronounce any conclusion on 
global warming pointing out that too little is known about the 
threat to make a judgment 
in an effort to sort out the problem a coalition of government 
agencies has launched a research effort that could extend over 
several years 
among those taking part are the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration the geological survey the defense department the 
council on environmental quality the national science foundation 
the agriculture department the national aeronautics and space 
administration and the environmental protection agency 
while the theory behind the greenhouse effect seems pretty 
simple its like a lot of other theories the reality is more 
complicated than the hypothesis 
the theory goes like this industrial processes over the last 
century have spilled a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
although carbon dioxide is colorless odorless and essentially 
harmless by itself it slows the passage of heat having extra 
carbon dioxide in the air means light can come in and warm the 
earth but heat cant go back out as easily as it once did 
thus the theory is that the earth should warm up because of the 
extra carbon dioxide its called the greenhouse effect because of 
the trapping of heat by the atmosphere somewhat like the trapping 
of warmth by greenhouse glass 
recent warm summers increased concern about this possibility 
and some eminent scientists have raised the possibility of a 
hazardous overheating 
these include gop obasi head of the world meteorological 
organization james hansen of the national aeronautics and space 
administration and stephen schneider of the national center for 
atmospheric research 
a spate of worrisome reports studies analyses and 
recommendations has come from such wideranging groups as the 
worldwatch institute the american society of mechanical engineers 
the center for strategic and international studies the us 
chamber of commerce and zero population growth 
yet voices are increasingly being heard on the other side of 
the issue especially in light of reports seeming to show a reduced 
threat 
its obvious that the most recent scientific results are 
drastically cutting the estimates of global warming 
climatologist patrick michaels of the university of virginia said 
in a telephone interview 
the more realistic climate models have more than halved the 
estimates of prospective warming and when compared to observed 
temperatures it still appears that these may be overestimates 
michaels said 
its intriguing to me that people with interventionist points 
of view tend to neglect the most sophisticated scientific 
findings he concluded 
the effect of clouds on the warning threat has been a major 
factor in recent studies 
computer models of the climate have been the source of many of 
the concerns about the warming but many models have little ability 
to include clouds indeed until recently opinions were mixed over 
whether clouds would cool the earth or add to the heating 
but new studies have found that overall clouds have a cooling 
effect by blocking incoming sunlight how much cooling will result 
remains to be seen some scientists say the clouds could cut the 
threatened warming in half 
and if warming does occur it could result in more evaporation of 
water making more clouds so a new balance could be reached with 
only little global warming 
computer models trying to find this balance disagree with one 
another however leaving many scientists unwilling to recommend 
anything beyond more research 
they warn that a few hot years dont make a trend just as the 
hot summers in the 1930s didnt mean global warming was imminent 
and the cooling trend from 1940 to 1980 didnt mean another ice age 
some climate warming reported over the last century could have 
resulted from changes in the brightness of the sun commented 
robert jastrow former head of nasas goddard institute for space 
studies 
forecasters cannot rely on the temperature increase observed 
in the last 100 years as an indicator of greenhouse warming in the 
next century said jastrow 
other studies have indicated that reports of increases in 
average temperature over the last 100 years may even be 
exaggerated national climatic data center studies found that in 
many cases temperature records are kept in cities that have 
recorded rising temperature as they grew larger and more crowded 
we are confronted with an inverted pyramid of knowledge a 
huge and growing mass of proposals for policy action is balanced on 
a handful of real facts said robert m white of the national 
academy of engineering 
writing in the september issue of the bulletin of the american 
meteorological society he asked 
can we arrest or slow the processes that increase the 
concentrations of greenhouse gases the answer is yes but we have 
no grasp on the social and economic ramifications of intervention 
nonetheless many environmentalists continue to advocate action 
on the theory that by the time science can give conclusive answers 
it may be too late to slow the warming trend 
clearly society does not have the resources to hedge against 
all possible negative future outcomes concedes schneider at the 
atmospheric research center 
but he says while research continues society should pursue 
those actions that provide widely agreed social benefits even if 
the predicted change does not materialize 
prime among those suggestions is improved energy efficiency that 
reduces release of carbon dioxide and also cuts down on energy 
costs and air pollution other steps would include developing 
alternative technologies and testing new crop strains 
waiting for scientific consensus he contends could allow the 
warming to speed up out of control forcing society to face an even 
larger and faster growing problem than is already feared

the us army claims beretta usa is not 
living up to its part of what has been called the pistol contract 
of the century according to a published report 
in a terse show cause notice aug 2 the army warned it 
could cancel the contract with the italian arms maker its sole 
supplier of sidearms because of production problems at berettas 
southern maryland plant the baltimore sun reported monday 
since you have failed to perform under the terms of the 
contract within the time required by its terms the us government 
is considering terminating the contract for default the 
notice said 
in june the army rejected a production lot of m9 9mm 
semiautomatic pistols produced by the us subsidiary of the 
italian arms maker beretta causing the company to fall behind its 
production schedule maj barry bomier an army spokesman said 
last week 
as of oct 1 beretta had failed to deliver a total of 8400 
guns bomier said under the terms of the contract the company is 
required to deliver 6000 guns a month he said 
pending a final decision in this matter it will be necessary 
to determine whether your failure to perform arose from causes 
beyond your control and without fault or negligence on your part 
the notice to the company said your failure to present any 
excuses may be considered as an admission that none exist 
bomier said the army does not plan to cancel the contract but 
wants an explanation for the delay a response was received from 
the company but it was unsatisfactory he said 
the army decided in 1980 to replace the colt 45 and other 
handguns with a standard 9mm pistol the award to beretta has been 
called the pistol contract of the century by some others 
including some members of congress objected to the selection of a 
foreign company for the contract 
jeffrey reh berettas contract officer said the armys 
showcause notice prevented the firm from discussing contractual 
issues at length 
we consider the shortage to be due to relatively minor testing 
difficulties reh said one of them has been resolved and 
were working to resolve the others 
the army said it rejected the lot in june because of possible 
defects reh said the rejection was precautionary 
the problems werent discovered in the field this came up in 
preshipment testing reh said 
the army which buys the 9mm pistols for all military services 
refused a lot of 500 guns because a sample weapon was found to have 
possible hairline cracks in its frame bomier said 
past problems with cracked frames forced the army to reject a 
total for 12000 handguns from lots in december 1987 and january 
1988 the previous rejections prompted the company to redesign the 
m9 pistol frame 
a more serious defect that caused four injuries last year 
prompted another design modification

the association of independent television stations in a 47page 
petition to the federal communications commission said monday the 
establishment of wgrctv channel 5 on the greater rochester 
cablevision system was a threat to fair competition and the 
diversity of programming for viewers 
the association said that unlike rochesters single independent 
tv station wuhftv channel 31 the cable system could drop or 
change the channel location of competing local broadcast stations 
control programming and sell and package advertising on numerous 
channels and control the type source and channel position of 
competing program services 
greater rochester cablevision which has 163000 subscribers is 
owned by the american television amp communications corp a 
subsidiary of timewarner inc 
john orr wgrcs general manager said he could not comment 
until he had read the associations filing 
the association said the relationship between the cable system 
and timewarner a major producer of cable and broadcast tv 
programs could give wgrctv an advantage in purchasing programs 
and could allow the cable system to discriminate against 
competitors 
the ability the system has to exploit is position is of 
great concern the associations attorney james popham told a 
news conference 
he said the timewarnerwgrc link known as vertical 
integration per se was not a problem but that the potential 
for abuses was 
james hedlund the associations vice president for government 
relations said there was nothing inherently bad with cable 
operators programming on one channel but it becomes a problem when 
a cable system is the sole provider in most cases of cable 
service to a community and when it can control both the delivery 
and the content of its programs 
the association said wgrc had hired former tv executives and a 
sales staff at the station and is running onetime network programs 
such as quincy knight rider and the ateam as an 
independent broadcast station would 
the station which began operation last month also has 
purchased alf and perfect strangers as well as firstrun 
syndication shows such as divorce court and movie packages 
according to the sept 18 issue of the television industry 
publication electronic media 
wgrc is sort of a next generation hedlund said this is a 
situation were trying to jump on before it becomes widespread 
the association asked the fcc to initiate proceedings looking 
towards adopting rules to preserve fair economic competition and 
a diversity of program sources in light of the increasing 
incentives for and actual occurences of anticompetitive behavior 
in the cable television industry

ogilvy because the job offered by american express was simply too 
exciting to turn down and because the postbuyout transition at 
ogilvy had been accomplished 
roman will become executive vice president corporate affairs and 
communications at american express reporting to james d robinson 
iii chairman and chief executive american express is one of 
ogilvys clients 
the post roman is taking is being vacated by harry l freeman 
who said in august that he planned to retire by years end in the 
wake of disclosures that an american express investigation of 
banker edmund safra had grown into an unauthorized campaign to 
discredit safra freeman was not implicated in the campaign but he 
explained in announcing his plans to retire that it occurred 
because of mistakes made on my watch 
ogilvy was acquired last summer for 864 million by wpp group 
owner of the j walter thompson advertising agency in what ranks 
as the biggest takeover in the ad business 
roman resisted the initial takeover offer of 45 a share but 
gave in after londonbased wpp sweetened it for a second time to 
54 a share 
in a telelphone interview monday roman said he wasnt 
looking for a new job when american express robinson approached 
him in september about freemans soontobevacated position 
leaving the company is a hard decision on my part roman 
said i have been running ogilvy amp mather for five years now i 
have just managed it through a takeover managed it through the 
transition through a move into a new building and new headquarters 
and we have just had a big worldwide management meeting where we 
laid out a new corporate strategy 
everything is in good shape and i felt it was time for 
someone to come in and carry it to the next stage he said 
roman is not being replaced in his positions at the ogilvy group

the struggling investment firm integrated

subsidiary to two executives and change the divisions name in an

gerard m lavin and gary w krat 
the change is directed at retaining credibility for integrateds 
3900 registered brokerdealers who sell products ranging from 
mutual funds to investment partnerships to stocks and bonds krat 
said in an interview 
right now now its fair to say if youre affiliated with the 
name integrated resources you have a problem he said 
integrated in june defaulted on nearly 1 billion of its total 
debt of about 175 billion since then the new yorkbased company 
has sought to sell its key financial assets including irec in an 
attempt to raise money to pay what it owes 
the sales force has shrunk from about 4600 in june when 
integrateds financial troubles became public and the company 
wanted to prevent further defections 
there has been a substantial decline over these many months in 
the amount of integrated product sales theyve been making as there 
has been growing resistance to the integrated name krat said 
but did not specify the decline 
while the sales force still would sell integrated products krat 
said brokerdealers under a new name dont have that first hurdle 
to overcome 
under the agreement irec sales personnel who are independent 
contractors licensed with the subsidiary would be offered the 
opportunity to be licensed with the new brokerdealer 
lavin and krat were the principal managers of the subsidiary 
based in englewood colo and new york krat said the deal which 
requires the approval of integrateds board should be completed by 
years end 
irec was the companys key financial subsidiary but its paper 
worth was minimal because the sales force was independent the 
company said it would retain the right to repurchase the stock of 
royal alliance if it arranges a sale of the subsidiary 
in addition to irec integrated wants to sell resources trust 
co integrated resources asset management corp an investment 
adviser and two of its life insurance companies integrated 
resources life insurance co of des moines iowa and capitol life 
insurance co of denver 
integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders 
since june the companys woes stem from difficulties diversifying 
out of real estate into financial services

general motors corp in a costcutting move may 
look overseas to find companies to produce gmsponsored television 
shows that would air in the united states 
the company plans to decide in four weeks whether to pursue the 
plan said philip guarascio the companys executive director of 
advertising 
the move would allow gm to bargain with the three major 
commercial networks for air time instead of simply buying 
commercial time slots 
gm like other automakers refuses to say how much it spends on 
advertising industry estimates quoted in mondays edition of the 
detroit news put the automakers network television advertising 
bill for last year at 4434 million 
ford motor co spokesman john jelinek said the nations no 2 
automaker has no such program in place or under consideration 
chrysler corp spokesmen did not return a reporters telephone call 
seeking comment on whether it had such plans

general motors corp has copied a technique used 
by credit card companies in the automakers battle to keep 
counterfeit parts out of the market 
gm is stamping holograms which are made by laser beams on 
packages of brake pads and electronic ignitions for export the 
difficulttoduplicate etchings have the superimposed words 
general motors gm and genuine in a small rectangle on 
the outside of the package 
gm ford motor co and chrysler corp have spent millions of 
dollars during the past several years to find and eliminate 
counterfeit parts makers 
some of these fake packages are so good that even we cant 
tell if theyre counterfeit said dan elliott director of gm 
security 
besides draining an automakers balance sheet a counterfeit 
part may not have the same quality as the real thing and that can 
lead to unanticipated problems including lawsuits 
for example a massachusetts school district sued gm after 
transmissions in its buses failed the district bought what it 
thought was gm transmission fluid which it contended led to the 
failures 
tests showed the fluid was a mixture of cheap oil and red dye 
and the automaker was dropped from the suit the fluid makers 
operations were raided by federal marshals 
elliott declined to say how much gm has lost because of 
counterfeit parts but said that the mideast had the largest 
concentration of bogus parts there he estimated about 40 percent 
of all parts labeled as gm actually are fakes 
ford and chrysler officials also declined to say how much their 
companies may have lost to parts counterfeiters but said raids at 
warehouses have turned up millions of dollars worth of fake 
components 
many of the fake parts are made and marketed overseas chrysler 
has less of a problem since its parts are available only through 
the companys dealerships

ual corps board of directors has decided to 
keep the parent company of united airlines independent for now as 
it examines alternatives to a 675 billion buyout that collapsed 
earlier this month 
the 300ashare bid from uniteds management pilots and 
british airways plc couldnt generate enough bank financing and 
its failure helped trigger a friday the 13th plunge in the stock 
market 
last week uals stock lost 11125 a share it closed up 10 a 
share on monday at 17837 on the new york stock exchange 
uals opening was delayed today due to an order imbalance with 
indications that it could open anywhere from 143 to 153 a share 
the boards announcement monday was vaguely and carefully 
worded leaving uals precise plans unclear it said it considered 
the failed bids price of 300 a share to be an attractive 
offer and in the best interests of shareholders 
consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value the 
board will continue to explore all strategic and financial 
alternatives available to the company the ual statement said 
but it did not mention any specific alternatives including an 
informal proposal from uals management and pilots unit reportedly 
valued at between 225 and 240 a share or as much as 542 
billion 
uniteds pilots said they were disappointed with uals failure 
to continue negotiating a possible takeover of the airline 
frederick c dubinsky head of the pilots group said the union 
was prepared to work with the board to shape a transaction that 
would provide ual stockholders with value significantly in excess 
of the current market price of ual stock 
analysts had linked the surge in uals stock monday to a wall 
street journal report saying the labormanagment group was 
considering a revised offer that would give employees a majority 
stake in the company and leave some stock in public hands 
but a separate statement from ual chairman stephen wolf on 
monday indicated an acquisition effort was over 
wolf said the cooperative buyout effort had helped management 
and the pilots to forge a substantially improved working 
relationship he said he hopes that all 70000 united employees 
can now turn their full attention to operating the best airline in 
the world 
stephen dexter an analyst with kemper financial services inc 
in chicago said wolfs statement indicates uals board wants 
management to return its attention to running united airlines 
what this kind of does it gives them a little breathing 
room dexter said

prime computer inc will lay off 2500 employees 
nearly 20 percent of its work force as part of a restructuring 
after its billiondollar buyout by jh whitney amp co the company 
said 
the layoffs announced monday will be spread over several months 
and will mostly affect primes employees in the united states 
the minicomputer company which is based in natick will be 
divided into four departments designed to focus on particular 
customer services said prime spokesman joe gavaghan more money 
will be spent on those that do well 
if there is a product for which there is not a strong market 
the spending on those products will be reduced or eliminated 
gavaghan said 
the companys new strategy was part of a plan to reduce the 1 
billion debt it took on after whitney a new york investment firm 
bought the company in august and ended primes 10month battle 
against hostile bidder mai basic four inc of tustin calif 
whitney paid 20 a share for 495 million prime shares and 
exchange notes with a face value of 22 per share for the remaining 
21 percent of primes shares 
much of the deal which analysts estimated was worth between 
106 billion and 116 billion was financed by debt said 
gavaghan 
gavaghan said the exact figure for primes debt would not be 
available until a special board meeting when the final details of 
the whitney merger were to be completed the meeting has not yet 
been scheduled he said 
officials at prime which also announced monday the introduction 
of two new software products for computeraided design declined to 
offer projections for primes revenue for the past year 
the firm whose revenue comes about equally from its ventures in 
minicomputers computeraided design systems and customer service 
did not issue a thirdquarter report 
the company turned a profit of 19 million on sales of 16 
billion in 1988 that year the firm posted a onetime loss of 58 
million based on costs involved in a merger with computervision 
corp said gavaghan 
the cost of defending against mai basic four and slow sales of 
minicomputers led to losses of 144 million in the final quarter 
of 1988 5 million in the first quarter of 1989 and 19 million in 
the second quarter 
prime said it has established a career counseling and training 
center at its natick headquarters to help those employees let go

bond corp holdings ltds debt 
totals 69 billion australian dollars with rising australian 
interest rates and the bell group ltd acquisition the chief 
causes chairman alan bond disclosed tuesday 
the disclosure followed fridays news that bond corp had 
incurred the largest annual loss in australian corporate history 
in its fiscal year ended june 30 bond corp lost 9802 million 
australian dollars the equivalent of about 7624 million much of 
the loss was due to onetime writedowns of the value of some of 
bond corps assets 
alan bond chairman and controlling shareholder of the 
cashstrapped australian media brewing natural resources and 
property concern provided the debt figures at a business gathering 
he said the debt load would have been heavier if not for a 
reduction of 5 billion australian dollars over the past year from 
asset sales bond indicated that detailed debt numbers which would 
include liabilities of units such as the bell group would be 
published soon in bond corps annual report 
bond predicted that the debt would be lightened by an additional 
38 billion australian dollars this year ending june 30 1990 but 
he didnt explain how the reduction would be achieved 
rising australian interest rates and the acquisition of bell 
group with its very high levels of shortterm debt were blamed 
by bond for creating a condition that was no longer sustainable 
in order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our 
principal lenders we embarked on fundamental changes in the 
structure and direction of the group bond said 
that realignment resulted in continuing asset sales as well as 
writeoffs exceeding 11 billon australian dollars in the past 
financial year in essence we have made a decision to clear the 
decks bond told the meeting 
while some assets have been written down others are undervalued 
on bond corps books bond maintained 
among the undervalued holdings are the companys australian 
brewing assets which bond said are actually worth 25 billion 
australian dollars while being on the books as being worth 950 
million australian dollars 
an investment in chiles telephone company is carried at 300 
million but really should be valued at 500 million according to 
bond also the companys property portfolio is undervalued by at 
least 250 million australian dollars he said 
bond forecast that by next june what will emerge will be a 
company with a honed sense of purpose a stable balance sheet 
with good quality assets in brewing telecommunications media and 
property 
he didnt mention energy resources on that list possibly 
signalling that all the companys coal and oil interests might be 
for sale some oil holdings already have been sold 
bond corps annual loss compared with a profit of 2735 million 
australian dollars a year earlier 
operating revenue in fiscal 1989 rose 69 percent to 848 billion 
australian dollars from 501 billion australian dollars but 
aftertax interest costs jumped 85 percent to 6867 million 
australian dollars from 3711 million australian dollars 
in commenting last week on its results bond corp said the 
financial performance of its us brewing operations g heileman 
brewing co was disappointing and this has been reflected in 
the results

a plunge in stock prices this morning sent sampp 
500 stockindex futures down the 12point limit permitted under 
circuitbreaker rules designed to slow a market collapse 
trading halted momentarily then prices began climbing again 
said merc spokeswoman julie jacobs 
the contract for december delivery of stocks tracked by the 
standard amp poors 500 index fell to 33595 on the chicago 
mercantile exchange at about 930 am cdt ms jacobs said the 
contract is valued at 500 a point 
the 12point drop tripped a circuitbreaker rule prohibiting 
selling at prices below that level for 30 minutes 
the decline occurred as the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
on the new york stock exchange tumbled more than 80 points before 
recovering some lost ground 
the decline in part was a reaction to news that ual corps 
board of directors had decided monday to keep the parent company of 
united airlines independent for now as it examines alternatives to 
a 300ashare buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month 
the merc circuitbreaker implemented after the 1987 market 
crash also kicked in on oct 13 when the market sold off sharply 
after financing for the ual deal fell through

from the offer price of 1131 they were up 288 at one point as

the allocation the investment firm warburg securities said 
gray market trading which takes place among investors before 
full trading begins through the stock exchange is the trading of 
promises to buy and sell shares once full trading starts

in a black market yet it is not full trading either

public offering across europe euro disneyland sca the french 
company building the park is selling 859 million shares for about 
1 billion in the 12 common market countries to help finance the

usair group inc the holding company for 
the nations seventhlargest airline reported a net loss of 777 
million for the third quarter which it attributed to flat demand 
and higher operating expenses 
usair said tuesday it lost 777 million or 186 a share in 
the three months ended sept 30 compared with a net profit of 
685 million or 158 a share in the third quarter of 1988 
thirdquarter revenue was unchanged at 15 billion 
domestic airline industry traffic growth was flat during 1989 
compared to 1988 and domestic industry revenue per passenger mile 
for the third quarter of 1989 was only 14 percent above the 
comparable period in 1988 said usair chairman and president 
edwin i colodny 
earnings also were affected by the airlines kids fly free 
program lower fares in california and frequent flir awards 
colodny said 
the company which absorbed piedmont aviation into its system in 
early august also reported higher labor and fuel costs as well as 
onetime costs stemming from the merger 
the effects of hurricane hugo which disrupted usairs major hub 
at charlotte nc and other southeastern cities cannot be 
quantified the company said 
however it said the effects of hugo and the recent california 
earthquake combined with recent trends are expected to cause 
operating results for the fourth quarter and for 1989 to be 
significantly lower than those of the comparable 1988 periods 
for the first nine months of 1989 usair reported net income of 
385 million or 76 cents a share on revenue of 48 billion 
that compares with net income of 1422 million or 328 a share 
on revenue of 42 billion for the same period last year

percent from 8414 million a year ago 
control data said the quarterly results were helped by the sale 
of imprimis the disk drive subsidiary to seagate technology 
pretax earnings of 162 million include an 85 million gain from 
restructuring which was made up of a 337 million gain from asset 
sales including imprimis offset by charges of 252 million 
for the first nine months of this year the company reported a 
loss of 484 million or a pershare loss of 1151 compared with 
earnings of 145 million or 34 cents a share for the 1988 
period revenues were 241 billion compared with 27 billion a 
year ago 
the company lost 4973 million in the second quarter mainly as 
a result of shutting down the eta systems supercomputer subsidiary 
and cutting 3100 jobs closing the st paul minnbased eta cost 
control data around 335 million the balance of the charges came 
from shrinking the cyber mainframe division paying severance to 
cover corporate staff layoffs and the companys departure from the 
training and education business 
the improved results the company achieved in the third quarter 
are gratifying and stems from the actions taken during the past 
several months said robert m price chairman and chief 
executive officer 
while the results represent only a modest return to positive 
momentum the company can now build on that momentum 
every business group except the semiconductor subsidiary was 
profitable before interest and taxes in the third quarter the 
company said

texaco inc said today its earnings rose 11 
percent in the third quarter helped by substantially higher 
results in the companys exploration and production business 
for the three months ended sept 30 texaco earned 305 million 
or 110 a share compared with 274 million or 112 a share a 
year earlier 
revenue dipped 4 percent to 836 billion from 868 billion 
the result of the companys recent asset restructuring 
texaco said the lower pershare earnings in the third quarter 
reflected a higher number of outstanding shares of common stock as 
well as a new preferred stock for which the company must set aside 
reserves 
in the first nine months texacos earnings more than doubled to 
213 billion or 819 a share from 101 billion or 414 a 
share in the comparable 1988 period 
revenue was down slightly at 2642 billion from 2667 billion 
ninemonth earnings benefited from a gain of 12 billion or 
487 a share from the sale of texaco canada inc in the first 
quarter the sale was part of a massive restructuring involving the 
sale of some 7 billion in assets 
texaco completed the assetsale portion of the restructuring 
earlier this year nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy 
protection texaco had filed for protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in april 1987 to 
avoid having to post a potentially damaging multibilliondollar 
security bond in its fight with pennzoil co 
pennzoil had sued claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of getty 
oil co interfered with pennzoils prior contract to buy part of 
getty a houston jury awarded pennzoil a 103 billion judgment 
texaco appealed but eventually settled with pennzoil for 3 billion 
texaco last week announced its first major acquisition since the 
restructuring a 4765 million purchase of tana production corp 
the corpus christitexasbased subsidiary of trt energy holdings 
inc with large natural gas and oil properties 
james w kinnear president of the nations thirdlargest oil 
concern behind exxon corp and mobil corp said texaco in the 
third period completed the distribution to shareholders of a 
portion of the proceeds from the restructuring 
it also initiated a stock buyback plan under which the company 
proposes to repurchase subject to market conditions 500 
million of its common stock by august 1990 texaco also retired 
approximately 1 billion of debt kinnear said 
higher crude oil prices during the third period boosted texacos 
exploration and production earnings substantially from 68 million 
in the 1988 period to 185 million in the latest quarter 
the companys chemicals business also showed strong gains 68 
million vs 45 million a year earlier 
lower gasoline prices and higher crude costs however hurt 
texacos refining and marketing business during the period 
earnings in that sector were cut in half to 180 million from 373 
million in the third quarter of 1988

ford motor co might try to buy jaguar plc 
outright when british government restrictions on investors shares 
in the luxury automaker expire at the end of 1990 the us 
automaker said tuesday 
meanwhile jaguar said ford was continuing to build its stake in 
the british luxury carmaker and had boosted its holdings to 12 
percent from 104 percent 
ford filed documents monday with the securities and exchange 
commission declaring that it might bid for all of jaguar 
spokeswoman lin cummins said 
whether a bid would in fact be made was not immediately known 
it isnt saying we will do it and it isnt saying we wont 
cummins said 
under british regulations no investor can acquire more than 15 
percent of jaguar until the end of 1990 the british government 
imposed that restriction when it privatized jaguar in 1984 
sec regulations require a company to state its intentions when 
it acquires 5 percent or more of another company and that led to 
mondays filing by ford cummins said 
jaguar has said it wants to remain independent 
the latest stock purchase coincided with talks between jaguar 
and general motors corp on an operating agreement that is expected 
to include a commitment from gm to take a small equity stake in 
jaguar 
jaguar said ford owned 219 million jaguar shares by the close 
of trading friday ford reported holding 190 million shares oct 
17 
ford said on sept 19 it planned to buy up to 15 percent of 
jaguar and has bought jaguar shares steadily in the open market 
since receiving us regulatory approval earlier this month 
ford notified jaguar of its sec filing monday by telephone but 
has not met with jaguar officials cummins said we are amenable 
to discuss the issue with them but no new meetings have been 
scheduled 
she said the company would not comment on gms talks with jaguar

an international money manager has sued shearson 
lehman hutton inc for allegedly cheating a mutual fund out of 60 
million by manipulating futures prices shortly after the 1987 stock 
market crash 
the complaint filed in us district court on behalf of quantum 
bvi mutual fund alleges that shearson traders and brokers 
conspired to depress the price of the standard amp poors 500 index 
contract at the chicago mercantile exchange 
the alleged misconduct occurred oct 22 1987 three days after 
the market plunge and moments after quantum entered a large sampp 
sell order through shearson quantum said in the lawsuit 
the 21 billion fund is headed by international money manager 
george soros whose large sell order sent the futures market 
plunging 24 percent in minutes 
the lawsuit charges that shearson three of its floor brokers 
and about 100 other traders and brokers conspired to sell 2400 sampp 
500 futures held by quantum at artificially low prices 
according to the complaint traders waited to buy the contracts 
until after futures price had plunged because of the sell order 
and quantum lost more than 60 million 
when the market later rebounded the defendants made a profit by 
selling the contracts they had bought at depressed prices quantum 
charged 
a shearson spokesman said monday we have reviewed the 
complaint and do not believe that there is any merit to the 
allegations and we do intend to contest the suit 
a lawyer for soros said the lawsuit was filed late friday to 
avoid a twoyear statute of limitations on such claims under the 
commodity exchange act 
also named as defendants are larry israel michael mullins and 
douglas young who were shearson floor brokers in the sampp 500 pit 
at the time of the trading 
in addition to the 60 million in alleged losses the suit seeks 
100 million in punitive damages

after two mistrials earlier this year jury 
selection began tuesday in the retrial of gaf corp and its vice 
chairman on stock manipulation charges 
the case initially attracted wide attention because as the first 
criminal trial stemming from the insider trading scandals of the 
mid1980s it also was seen as a test of information derived 
indirectly from jailed stock speculator ivan boesky 
the most recent mistrial occurred march 23 when a jury announced 
after 12 days of deliberations that it was hopelessly deadlocked 
us district judge mary johnson lowe declared the first 
mistrial in january after determining that prosecutors had 
unintentionally withheld an experts report that a key piece of 
evidence had been altered 
lowe began jury selection for the third trial by explaining the 
charges against gaf two subsidiaries and gaf vice chairman james 
t sherwin 
the defendants were indicted in july 1988 for allegedly trying 
to boost union carbide corps stock price in 1986 shortly before 
selling a large block of carbide shares they were charged with 
securities fraud wire fraud and conspiracy 
gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building materials 
manufacturer and its two subsidiaries face maximum fines totaling 
12 million or 500000 on each of eight counts against each of 
the three sherwin faces 40 years in prison and a fine of up to 2 
million 
the prosecutions main witness against gaf has been los angeles 
stockbroker boyd l jefferies who pleaded guilty to two felony 
counts of breaking securities laws in 1987 and began cooperating 
with the government 
jefferies was sentenced july 6 to five years probation and fined 
250000

digital equipment corp unveiled what it called 
the first true mainframe computer in its 32year history tuesday in 
what may be a direct challenge to international business machines 
corp 
the announcement came on the same day as ibm itself announced 
upgrades to its own aging but still dominant line of mainframes 
which are the biggest kind of generalpurpose computers 
the processors in digitals new vax 9000 series are the most 
powerful ever introduced by the company five times as fast as its 
most powerful previous processors digital officials said 
digital has previously focused on raising power by clustering 
together several midsized machines tuesdays announcement is seen 
as a recognition that some jobs can only be done by single big 
computers 
its going to do very well predicted howard anderson an 
analyst who is managing director of the yankee group in boston 
digital always has great software and their users have a hunger 
for power the users keep getting bigger systems and theyll need 
this 
the new systems will be capable of work ranging from 
supercomputing jobs such as weather forecasting and oil exploration 
to business jobs such as rapid transaction processing 
although digital sometimes referred to two of its computers in 
the 1970s as mainframes digital spokesman mclaren harris said that 
in this case we feel comfortable in saying this is a true 
mainframeclass machine 
prices for the new systems range from 124 million for the 
singleprocessor model to 392 million for the fourprocessor 
model 
theyve essentially been naked in this particular category 
said john adams an analyst with adams harkness and hill in 
boston theyre both refurbishing one end of the product line and 
extending the companys grasp into new territory 
at present about 70 percent of ibms earnings come from 
mainframe hardware and software in contrast about 90 percent of 
digitals earnings and sales stem from its minicomputers 
digitals introduction of a new mainframe coincided with ibms 
announcement tuesday that it has improved its own mainframe 
computers and software the centerpiece was hiperbatch a piece of 
software that ibm said speeds up by as much as 60 percent the 
processing of overnight backoffice batch jobs 
ibms biggest mainframes are still bigger than digitals the 
processors of ibms new machines can hold up to 45 billion 
characters in live memory about nine times as much as the maximum 
of 512 million characters in digitals new computers 
ibms bernard puckett said the announcement in new york had been 
planned well in advance and it was truly circumstantial that 
it came the same day as the digital announcement 
batch processing an unglamorous aspect of computing consists 
of endoftheday work such as updating customer records at stock 
brokerage houses reconciling customer accounts at banks and 
controlling inventory in factories 
hiperbatch was designed in cooperation with shearson lehman 
hutton inc shearsons computer chief jack owens said it had 
proven to be a silver bullet for the brokerage house which was 
squeezed for time by the emergence of global trading 24 hours a day 
ibm also announced new equipment and software for manufacturing 
upgrades for its aging but still profitable line of 3090 mainframe 
computers and new security products including a 1205 pen that 
can detect forgery attempts 
ibm based in armonk ny is the worlds largest computer 
company and digital based in maynard mass is the second 
largest

sears roebuck and co tuesday said its 
thirdquarter profit fell 156 percent reflecting a sharp drop in 
retailing income and a storm of claims filed against the allstate 
insurance co by victims of hurricane hugo 
the claims of more than 250 million represented the greatest 
single stormdamage loss in allstates history sears said in 
announcing its quarterly results 
sears earned 2575 million or 75 cents a share in the three 
months ended sept 30 compared with 305 million or 80 cents a 
share in the comparable 1988 quarter 
the pershare earnings reflected a stockbuyback program 
announced a year ago that has reduced the number of outstanding 
shares to 3431 million compared to 3798 million a year ago sears 
said 
thirdquarter revenue rose 48 percent to 132 billion from 
126 billion the chicagobased company said in a news release 
income from the sears merchandise group the nations largest 
retailing operation plunged 25 percent to 829 million from 
1105 million sears said 
revenue from the retailing division edged up 13 percent to 76 
billion from 75 billion in 1988s third quarter 
sears attributed the retailing results to a soft market for 
bigticket durable goods such as home appliances and higher 
interest costs in the credit segment of the merchandise group 
two retail analysts expressed differing opinions on whether the 
performance of the merchandise group indicated that sears 
everyday low pricing strategy is failing 
my opinion is that they probably have to do more promotion to 
get the customers in the door said walter loeb of morgan stanley 
amp co 
but john landschultz of cowen amp co said the results werent 
bad at all the real test of the new retailing strategy will come 
in the second half of 1990 he said after sears finishes reshaping 
its stores into collections of superstores offering lowcost 
brandname items in general groupings such as womens clothing 
major appliances or menswear 
theyre still in an adjustment period cowen said 
sears spokesman douglas fairweather was upbeat about the 
strategy which sears began implementing last march to better 
compete with discounters such as k mart corp and walmart stores 
inc 
were very pleased with the results of everyday low pricing 
but that durable goods trough is very real and very significant 
he said 
allstates income fell to 1261 million from 2027 million 
largely as a result of damage claims from hurricane hugo which 
battered the southeastern us coastline in september 
the claims exceeded 250 million but because of reinsurance 
the practice among large insurance companies of farming out some of 
their risk to smaller insurers the negative impact on sears 
thirdquarter net income was only 80 million the company said 
allstate spokesman greg rossiter said it was a natural 
conclusion that the company would also be hit with a lot of 
damage claims from the earthquake that struck northern california a 
week ago 
but rossiter said he could not predict the dollar amount of the 
earthquake claims 
the dean witter financial services group reported net income of 
357 million for the quarter up 32 percent from 271 million in 
1988 those results included a 71 percent increase in income from 
discover card operations which totaled 233 million 
thirdquarter income from the coldwell banker real estate group 
jumped to 812 million from 222 million last year reflecting a 
nearly fourfold increase in aftertax gains from sale of 
properties 
for the nine months ended sept 30 sears reported overall net 
income of 9064 million or 256 per share compared to 134 
billion or 352 per share for the first nine months of 1988 
ninemonth revenue rose 82 percent to 386 billion from 357 
billion 
the ninemonth results for 1988 include a firstquarter 
accounting change that resulted in a 550000 increase in the 
reported net income sears said

the stock market went for another rough ride 
today dropping steeply in morning trading only to finish the day 
about even 
the collapse of the ual corp buyout helped unnerve an already 
shaky market and the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
briefly tumbled as much as 85 points in the first 1 hours of 
trading 
after partially rebounding the dow jones average was down 
between 40 and 50 points for most of the session then rallied in 
the final hour 
contributing to the late recovery were separate rumors about 
billionaire investor donald trump one that he was interested in 
buying ual the parent of united airlines and one that he was 
considering renewing his bid for amr corp the parent of american 
airlines 
in addition to the ual buyout failure analysts said traders 
were worried about lowerthanexpected corporate profits in the 
third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the governments 
latest report on factory orders 
underlying the markets volatility is continued nervousness that 
wall street has not entirely recovered from the friday the 13th 
crunch when the dow jones average fell 19058 points

wall street rose a session of bucking stock 
prices today watching shares plummet in early trading and bounce 
back up in a late rally to finish the day little changed 
the widely watched dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
down as much as 85 points in early trading finished down just 369 
points at 265922 
broader market indicators also fell in heavy trading with 
declining issues outnumbering advancers ones by almost 7 to 2 on 
the new york stock exchange big board volume totaled 23796 
million shares compared with 13586 million in mondays session 
analysts said news that ual corps board of directors had 
decided late monday not to proceed with a buyout plan by an 
employeemanagement group affected other transportation stocks and 
helped trigger the morning selloff 
ual finished down 837 at 170 after having been down down 
more than 32 a share earlier in the day 
computerized program trading involving stockindex futures also 
contributed to the decline market watchers said 
the ual groups oct 13 announcement that it was unable to get 
financing for its 675 billion buyout played a role in the 
19058point drop in the dow industrials that day and turmoil in 
stock markets worldwide 
the market rebounded from that drop with the dow industrials 
gaining a record 11988 points last week 
market watchers also said the governments report today of a 01 
percent slight decline in durable goods orders during september did 
nothing to dispel concerns over lowerthanexpected corporate 
profits for the third quarter

general motors corp said tuesday it is making a 
multimilliondollar commitment to become the sole sponsor of 
several television specials over the next two tv seasons 
john mcnulty a spokesman for the automaker in detroit said the 
programs will be billed on the broadcast and cable television 
networks that carry them as gm mark of excellence presentations 
he said gm is committing about 11 million to the project this 
tv season and an unspecified amount for next tv season starring in 
the fall of 1990 
mcnulty said gm spent about 8 million last year to be the sole 
sponsor of similar shows and feels that consumers who have watched 
the shows tend to remember the sponsor and usually have an improved 
opinion of the company 
the new programs will include the american playwrights 
theater series of plays on the arts amp entertainment cable 
network the annual kennedy center honors specials on cbs 
the american film institute life achievement award special on 
abc and nbcs planned movie the old man and the sea 
gm will be the sole advertiser on telecasts of these programs 
which are variously scheduled for later this year through 1991 
in addition gm said it had agreed to be the sole corporate 
underwriter of public broadcasting system programs including the 
a world of ideas with bill moyers series the live from 
lincoln center series of music and ballet performances and a 
planned 10hour movie epic called the civil war 
mcnulty said gm has over the past five years of devoted a large 
portion of the money it spends on corporate image advertising 
as opposed to product ads that tout specific cars on sole 
sponsorships 
it is one companys attempt to underwrite and exclusively 
sponsor programs we believe are worthy to carry our name he 
said 
mcnulty declined to say how much gm spends on corporate image 
advertising 
the trade journal advertising age recently estimated that gm 
spent nearly 13 billion on all types of advertising last year 
making it the thirdbiggest advertiser behind consumer products 
companies philip morris cos inc and procter amp gamble co

currencies tuesday depressed by volatility on wall street and

a steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the dow jones 
industrial average touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar 
sales that subsided once the stock market started to recover later 
in the day 
david jaques a vice president at barclays bank plc in new york 
said the dollar didnt manage to recover all of the ground lost 
during the temporary stock market selloff the dow industrials

he said currency dealings were lethargic in the early going 
with traders lacking a compelling reason to buy or sell news of a 
01 percent decline in september orders for us durable goods 
created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the figure 
virtually matched advance estimates 
the durable goods report tended to support the view that 
economic growth is flattening out to such an extent that the 
federal reserve might decide to pump it up with more generous 
credit 
looser credit would push down interest rates declining us 
interest rates generally weigh down the dollar 
the dollar began its trading day in tokyo with a fall to 14210 
japanese yen from 14240 yen at mondays close later in london

treasury bond prices rose sharply tuesday 
sustaining most of large early gains despite an afternoon rebound 
in the volatile stock market 
encouraging signs tuesday that the federal reserve would not 
drive interest rates higher to fight inflation the enemy of 
fixedincome securities such as bonds also boosted the credit 
market during a hectic trading day 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds the bellwether 
30year issue gained 532 point or 469 per 1000 face value 
down from as much as 1532 point earlier in the day 
the bonds yield which moves in the opposite direction from its 
price tumbled to 789 percent from 793 percent late monday 
the stock market was the real story said steven a wood an 
economist with bankamerica capital markets group in san francisco 
the rise in treasury prices followed a pattern established in 
the friday the 13th stock market tumble when bonds rose sharply as 
investors shifted money out of stocks when the dow jones industrial 
average fell about 190 points the long bond rose about 5 on 
monday after the dow closed down 26 points 
on tuesday the dow industrial average declined as much as 85 
points in the morning session before rebounding to finish the day 
down 369 points 
bond prices typically rise during a stock market selloff because 
treasury bonds which are guaranteed by the government are 
considered a safe haven in times of financial instability 
half the gains were sustained and that really was a pretty 
good performance wood said of tuesdays dealings 
wood also said the federal reserve did not drain reserves from 
the banking system as widely had been expected he said that by 
staying out of the market the fed kept a lid on the federal funds 
rate which is regarded as an indicator of the feds shortterm 
intentions 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 81116 percent up from 8 percent monday 
people are now convinced the fed is more likely to allow the 
funds rate to be soft than to push them up for fear either the 
stock market or the economy will tank wood said 
prices of shortterm governments were up 132 point to 532 
point intermediate maturities gained point to 532 point and 
longterm issues gained from 516 point to 716 point according to 
telerate inc the financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 238 to 119345 
many corporate bonds also increased moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures total return on a portfolio of 
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer gained 
049 to 33854 
highyield lowerrated junk bonds followed the stock market 
descent but not its rebound traders said many widely traded issues 
were off about point 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds was 922532 up 316 point the average 
yield to maturity dropped to 731 from 733 percent late monday 
meanwhile yields threemonth treasury bills auctioned monday

its lowest daily close since aug 11 
it was a bloody bloody day said james steel a metals 
analyst with refco inc a large commodities brokerage 
the decline began early and accelerated as prices fell through 
successive levels of technical support the december contract 
traded as low as 1134 before rebounding shortly before the close 
copper prices have fallen nearly 12 percent in the past seven 
trading sessions largely in reaction to an improving supply 
picture 
but analysts said tuesdays selloff was more a reflection of 
economic anxiety prompted by the stock markets volatility and by a 
government report tuesday that orders for durable goods fell 01 
percent in september 
on the stock market tuesday the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks briefly tumbled 85 points in the first 1 hours 
of trading partially rebounded then was down 40 to 50 points for

i believe the copper market is fearing a recession said 
peter cardillo a commodities trading adviser with josephthal amp co 
in new york as an industrial metal copper would suffer if a 
recession came along

mercantile exchange when the december sampp 500 contract fell the 
permitted 12point limit to 33595 early in the session 
the drop triggered a rule prohibiting selling at prices below 
that level for 30 minutes but trading halted only momentarily 
before buying entered the market and prices rebounded 
the rule is one of several circuitbreakers designed to slow a 
market collapse 
the contract for december delivery of stocks tracked by the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled 145 points lower at 34650 
each point is worth 500

texaco inc reported an 11 percent rise in thirdquarter 
earnings tuesday while mobil corp chevron corp and shell oil 
co said earnings declined 
the results reflected the benefits of texacos postbankruptcy 
restructuring as well as the mixed impact of higher crude prices 
which helps oil companies boost earnings on the exploration and 
production end of their business but hurts the downstream end 
of refining and marketing 
crude prices have been hovering between 19 and 20 a barrel 
about 3 higher than the same time last year 
mobils earnings slipped 4 percent in the three months ended 
sept 30 to 532 million or 130 a share from 557 million or 
136 a share in the comparable 1988 period revenue for the 
nations secondlargest oil concern totaled 1364 billion up 4 
percent over 1312 billion a year earlier 
in the first nine months new yorkbased mobil earned 14 
billion or 332 a share down 16 percent from 16 billion a year 
earlier revenue reached 4169 billion up 2 percent from 4099 
billion 
contributing to the lower quarterly earnings mobil said was a 
decline in chemical results and a 40 million provision for 
restructuring of its us exploration and production business 
mobil spokesman john lord declined to give details of the 
restructuring except to say that it would involve the transfer and 
termination of employees over a twoyear period in order to 
reduce costs and focus efforts in areas where the projected 
financial returns are most attractive 
texaco earned 305 million or 110 a share in the third 
quarter up 11 percent from 274 million or 112 a share a year 
earlier revenue dipped 4 percent to 836 billion from 868 
billion the result of the companys recent postbankruptcy court 
restructuring 
texaco based in white plains ny said the lower pershare 
earnings in the third quarter reflected a higher number of 
outstanding shares of common stock as well as a new preferred stock 
for which the company must set aside reserves 
in the first nine months texacos earnings more than doubled to 
213 billion or 819 a share from 101 billion or 414 a 
share in the comparable 1988 period revenue was down slightly at 
2642 billion from 2667 billion 
besides strong gains in the companys exploration and production 
businesses texaco benefited from the restructuring which lowered 
its corporate losses including interest expenses from the payment 
of debt by 117 million in the period 
there are so many changes going on internally that the 
financial data really isnt comparable with a year ago its almost 
misleading to compare it with last year said oil industry 
analyst rosario ilacqua with the investment firm of nikko 
securities co international inc 
texaco completed the assetsale portion of the restructuring 
earlier this year nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy 
protection texaco had filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in april 1987 after 
losing a highstakes court battle with pennzoil co that cost 
texaco 3 billion 
chevron corp headquartered in san francisco earned 417 
million or 122 a share in the third quarter down slightly from 
420 or 123 a share a year earlier revenue jumped 11 percent 
to 8 billion from 72 billion 
in the ninemonths chevrons earnings declined 29 percent to 
113 billion or 331 a share from 16 billion or 466 a 
share in the yearearlier period revenue totaled 239 billion 
up about 9 percent from 22 billion 
shells thirdquarter earnings fell 7 percent to 340 million 
from 364 million a year earlier revenue dipped to 540 billion 
from 547 billion 
ninemonth earnings grew by 11 percent to 114 billion from 
103 billion while sales at houstonbased shell increased 3 
percent to 1644 billion from 1594 billion 
shell is wholly owned by the royal dutchshell group of 
companies based in both london and the hague the netherlands the 
company does not report pershare earnings 
sun co said its earnings jumped 18 percent in the third 
quarter due largely to higher earnings from the companys canadian 
subsidiary and increased exploration and production results 
overseas 
sun earned 85 million or 80 cents a share compared with 72 
million or 67 cents a share a year earlier revenue totaled 273 
billion up 11 percent from 246 billion 
ninemonth earnings totaled 271 million or 254 a share a 
turnaround from the 69 million loss equal to 66 cents a share 
recorded in the yearearlier period revenue in the first nine 
months rose 14 percent to 830 billion from 728 billion in the 
1988 period 
sun said the absence of 10 million of losses from domestic 
exploration and production operations in last years results 
contributed to an improvement in the latest figures

the transportation company currently is in the midst of a 20 
millionshare repurchase program that ends at the end of this year

million shares all are acquired the number of publicly held shares 
will be reduced by 26 percent ms noxon said 
she said the company began its repurchase program in 1987 after 
efforts to acquire the conrail system and piedmont aviation fell 
through norfolk southern had 1 billion in cash reserves and 
believed its best return was to buy back its own stock

wall street added to its casino image tuesday in 
a heartthumping session that saw the dow jones 30stock industrial 
average plummet 85 points in the morning but rally to finish nearly 
even 
the dow jones average closed with a narrow decline of 369 
points at 265922 
broader measures of the market showed bigger declines than the 
dow average declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 
3 to 1 on the new york stock exchange 
the markets wild behavior was attributed to speculation over 
the fate of buyout plans for ual corp and continued skittishness 
dating from the friday the 13th plunge when the dow industrials 
fell more than 190 points 
adding to the markets volatility was computerdriven program 
trading which seems to compress up and down trends into far 
briefer periods of time 
this is clearly a market that you cant turn your back on for 
10 minutes said barton biggs chief investment strategist at 
morgan stanley amp co 
ual led the market downward in the morning and back up late in 
the day when rumors spread that several potential buyers including 
donald trump were accumulating stock in the parent of united 
airlines 
the initial decline in uals stock came after the announcement 
late monday by uals board that it had decided to stay independent 
for now as it examined alternatives to a 300ashare 
employeemanagement buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month 
the stock of ual fell more than 30 a share in the morning but 
recovered to finish down only 8 at 170 
the worst period for the market came at midmorning when the dow 
jones average fell more than 50 points in less than half an hour to 
touch its low of 85 points off 
in chicago the sampp 500 stockindex futures contract fell the 
12point limit permitted under circuitbreaker rules designed 
to slow heavy market selloffs index futures prices rebounded after 
trading resumed 
adding to traders nervousness tuesday were lowerthanexpected 
thirdquarter profits from several major companies and worries 
about an economic slowdown the commerce department reported that 
orders for big ticket durable goods slipped 01 percent in 
september 
peter barry director of research at fahnestock amp co said he 
was alarmed by reports that ual takeover speculation was the main 
factor in the markets rally in the final hour 
i would truly hope that an event such as that a new offer for 
ual true or not would not be enough to turn the entirety of 
financial assets stocks and bonds on its ear that would raise 
questions about the underpinnings of the market wouldnt you 
say barry said 
aside from ual other actively traded issues included security 
pacific which fell to 44 philip morris up to 44 chase 
manhattan down at 38 and amr down 1 at 68

supercomputer maker cray research inc on 
tuesday reported a 354 percent increase in thirdquarter earnings 
but said the results still lag behind expectations 
the company which earlier this month announced plans to lay off 
400 workers or 7 percent of its workforce reported earnings of 
3065 million 104 per share for the quarter ended sept 30 
that compares with 1988 thirdquarter earnings of 2261 million or 
73 cents per share 
thirdquarter 1989 revenues were 21016 million up 447 
percent from 14521 million in the same period a year ago 
earnings for the first nine months of the year total only 3657 
million or 124 per share compared with 681 million or 219 
per share for the same period a year ago ninemonth revenue 
totaled 45456 million compared with 42542 million for the first 
nine months of 1988 
since much of our current backlog is for 1989 deliveries we 
do not have great visibility into 1990 said marcelo a gumucio 
crays president and chief operating officer 
with the visibility we do have along with an assessment of 
our prospect list we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next 
year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat 
he said based on the companys revised projections earnings 
results will likely be 40 percent to 45 percent lower than the 
companys 1988 performance of 1566 million 
cray said customers accepted 17 systems with total contract 
value of about 175 million during the third quarter the value of 
systems ordered during the quarter totaled about 145 million and 
the value of the order backlog at the end of the quarter was about 
315 million compared to 340 million at the end of the second 
quarter

john b curcio whose authority at the 
wheel of mack trucks inc plunged along with company profits for 
the past nine months has relinquished his last title with the 
truck maker 
with the company on the verge of announcing a thirdquarter loss 
it expects to be about 50 million and looking at projected losses 
in the final three months of the year curcio resigned monday as 
chairman 
curcio lost the post of president to newcomer ralph reins in 
june when expectations of a loss in the second quarter were 
announced and then chief executive to the heir apparent in 
september when the thirdquarter projection was disclosed 
curcios resignation will be effective with the election of his 
successor possibly as soon as nov 2 when the mack board of 
directors will hold a special meeting reins said 
the push to remove curcio apparently has been led by renaults 
truck operations which owns about 45 percent of macks stock and 
has four directors on macks 10member board 
heads will roll at mack phillipe gras chief of renaults 
truck operations promised a french newspaper after the 
thirdquarter projections were announced 
curcio 56 moved out of his office at macks world headquarters 
in allentown friday concluding a 10year stay in the sixthfloor 
executive offices 
curcio is the third key executive to leave the company in recent 
months following the departures of louis j lafontaine executive 
vice president of administration and john j costa executive vice 
president of manufacturing 
to fill their respective places reins recruited william c 
craig a vice president of human resources at volkswagen of 
america and don defosset president of offhighway products and 
driveline division at rockwell international corp 
macks earnings dropped 77 percent in the first quarter to 
1203 million then further to a 1842 million loss in the second 
quarter 
curcio was running it and he stumbled said frank 
prezelski an analyst for deutsche bank capital corp of new york 
when youre a strongwilled central manager as he was theres no 
one else to blame its unfortunate but he has to take 
responsibility 
according to prezelski renault lost its patience with curcios 
regime early last month when gras learned of macks continuing 
problems with its new e7 engine and an industrywide decline in 
the truck market 
this truck industry is a neverending battle curcio said in 
a telephone interview monday with the morning call of allentown 
from his home its time for someone else to be on the front 
lines 
mack is in good hands curcio said
