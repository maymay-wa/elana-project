columbias seven astronauts arrived 
full of confidence thursday night as the countdown proceeded 
uninterrupted toward a weekend liftoff of the shuttle with an 
observatory 
were back were ready and were wanting to get on with 
it columbias commander vance brand said after flying in with 
his crew from johnson space center in houston 
earlier in the day nasa test director mike leinbach said the 
countdown was going smoothly 
three of columbias four previous countdowns since spring came 
to an abrupt halt about six hours before liftoff because of 
hydrogen leaks numerous repairs were needed 
its been a long hot summer for us filled with a couple of 
major disappointments but the team is really upbeat now 
leinbach said everyone is feeling good looking forward to a 
nice christmas present which will be getting the thing off the 
ground sunday morning 
columbia is scheduled to blast off at 128 am est sunday 
meteorologists said thursday there is a 70 percent chance the 
weather will cooperate 
four of columbias astronauts are astronomers who will operate 
the onboard observatory called astro 
leinbach said the one big worry for everybody a leaking 
fuel system was no longer a threat columbia grounded in late 
may was cleared for flight during a fueling test last month 
atlantis also was found to be free of dangerous hydrogen leaks 
during an october tanking test and returned last week from a secret 
military mission 
still there are thousands of other things that can get us 
anything can bite you leinbach said columbias second 
countdown for example was halted because of problems with the 
observatory 
among those afraid to get their hopes up are scientists who have 
been working on the astro mission since the original 1986 launch 
date the challenger accident that year was responsible for the 
lengthy delay 
were just as excited the only qualifier is weve learned to 
be somewhat skeptical if it will actually happen until we see it 
get launched said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university 
the principal investigator for one of astros four telescopes 
the whole goal is the science were going to do thats just 
as exciting as it was several years ago davidsen said 
the three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope that 
constitute the 150 million observatory will focus on some of the 
hottest objects in the universe the approximately 240 targets 
include one of the most distant visible quasars a halfdozen 
binary stars and a supernova 
ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from these objects are 
invisible from earth astro consequently will provide our first 
detailed glimpse of the universe in the extreme ultraviolet portion 
of the electromagnetic spectrum davidsen said 
well see things that cant be seen normally and hopefully 
solve some very important things in astronomy davidsen said

virginia velez came to stanford 
university seeking a safe place to live openly with her lesbian 
lover but a policy expanding the rights of homosexual couples on 
campus leaves her feeling threatened 
velez and others in the homosexual community fear a backlash 
particularly from religious groups the policy which began this 
fall guarantees unmarried couples the same housing health care 
and campus privileges as married couples 
im getting nervous about whats going on said velez a 
graduate student in education what the administration has done 
is satisfying but the fundamentalist groups islamic and 
christian are creating incredible tension and they can erupt at 
any time 
stanfords effort to build a tolerant diverse body of 
international students has led to verbal clashes and occasional 
harassment over attitudes about race religion and sexual 
orientation the latest involves the backlash to the domestic 
partners policy 
i think stanford is probably one of the best places to be 
openly gay or lesbian or bisexual and its still scary said 
susan mizner a thirdyear law student and gay activist 
its still got a number of people who i would unabashedly call 
bigots and even more people who would prefer not to deal with 
anyone they know is gay lesbian or bisexual 
twothirds of the students said in an informal survey they 
support the new policy foreign students particularly from the 
middle east asia and africa are among the most vocal opponents 
of stanfords 12600 graduate and undergraduate students nearly 
2500 are foreigners foreigners comprise about a quarter of the 
6100 graduatestudent population which dominates the married 
student housing village 
university officials say they wont revoke the policy which 
allows unwed couples with longterm commitments to rent 
lowcost campus apartments and have spouse privileges such as 
subsidized medical care and access to the libraries and gyms 
the policy applies to six couples this term officials expect 
the number to rise to 20 to 30 during the next few years 
we have a strong belief that what we did was the right thing 
to do said norm robinson dean of student affairs i think 
some of the objections that are based on religion also reflect 
quite a high degree of homophobia 
stanfords policy is being studied by other schools harvard has 
a nondiscrimination housing policy while several other schools 
allow unwed couples to live together on a casebycase basis 
the stanford administrations staunch support brought praise 
from homosexuals who now want unwed couples covered by health 
insurance 
it is making a big difference in our lives says david 
bradfute a graduate student in biological sciences and member of 
the lesbian gay amp bisexual community center 
the university is saying well recognize you we value you 
who you are and the kinds of relationships you get into no state 
is recognizing us the federal government is far from recognizing 
us and in many ways were a target for official discrimination it 
means a lot to us in this society 
opponents however attack the policy on religious moral and 
cultural grounds 
it devalues the sanctity of marriage and of the family unit 
both of which asians have traditionally taken very seriously 
said grace tan a chemistry graduate student from singapore 
also this more open policy is susceptible to abuse by people 
seeking lowercost university housing with all its fringe 
benefits 
abdullah bature president of the stanford islamic society said 
his group of about 100 students wants university trustees to revoke 
the policy 
the koran says sex relations are allowed only between husband 
and wife not between woman and woman man and man or unmarried man 
and woman bature said 
all the members of my society are fundamentalists he added 
we cannot change the law of islam which does not permit acts of 
unnatural intercourse but we are not terrorists we want to live 
with everybody in peace 
jon osborne who lives in student housing with steve mims a 
senior in electrical engineering argued homosexuals pay the same 
tuition as heterosexuals and should have the same rights 
for years people said that gays dont really have 
relationships that were promiscuous or that gay relationships 
dont last very long osborne said now when we get together in 
longterm relationships on campus they say we dont want you next 
door

the citys fiscal crisis has given a red 
light to no parking signs but the streets department says stop 
signs are still go 
we have stopped temporarily installing nonsafetyrelated 
signs and poles deputy streets commissioner john heany said 
wednesday 
inventories of sign poles and of the 12by18inch blanks used 
for parking signs are dwindling he said the department has a 
purchase order for the blanks and expects to have one for poles in 
a few days he said 
i dont expect to run out he said the department is still 
printing signs he said 
poles are being saved for stop do not enter and other 
trafficcontrol signs which are still being installed heany said 
no parking limitedtime parking residentialsticker parking 
reserved parking for the handicapped and some loading zone signs 
are on hold he said 
our first responsibility is to make sure that signs that are 
necessary for public safety and control of traffic are installed 
heany said we have enough materials right now to perform that 
responsibility 
the work on hold is prinicipally ordered by the philadelphia 
parking authority he said 
the authority has 367 outstanding work orders spokeswoman linda 
miller said 
it causes confusion for the motorists when they go to park 
she said there may be missing signs and they dont know what the 
parking regulations are 
in turn that creates a problem for parking enforcement 
if theres no sign there they officers cannot write the 
ticket ms miller said and if the ticket is written it has 
to be recommended for cancellation 
the situation arose as the finance department put the brakes on 
spending to try to keep the city from going broke in december 
a 375 million note issue collapsed in september amid investor 
worries about the citys fiscal condition city officials now hope 
to float about 300 million in notes with backing from the pension 
fund local banks the state treasury and private investors 
even with the cash infusion the city projects a 2295 million 
deficit during the fiscal year that began july 1 and a 278 million 
deficit during fiscal 1992 
before you get any orders processed you have to make a case 
that its necessary work heany said

marjorie roth stalks philadelphias streets 
with a screwdriver searching for the stolen license plate that has 
made her life a nightmare 
last spring someone stole the expired tag from roths 1984 
toyota station wagon and put it on a different car since then the 
car has been parked illegally all over town racking up tickets 
that were charged to roth 
thirtyfour of them in about five months carrying a total of 
1503 in fines 
the car was once cited four times in a single day its been 
ticketed for parking on sidewalks in front of bus stops and at 
expired meters 
i will continue to get tickets because this car has not been 
found roth said wednesday this is going to be an ongoing 
problem forever 
at a hearing dec 10 before city parking violation officials 
roth will argue that she should not be responsible for the fines 
because the plate was stolen 
in the meantime she has staked out market street where many of 
the tickets were issued and plans to remove the license plate if 
she spots it 
its not a matter of the 34 tickets its a matter of this 
person continuing to get tickets which is why ive been stalking 
him with a screwdriver in my car said roth a 51yearold flight 
attendant 
this week she got a notice that the car would be booted or 
towed if cited again 
the last ticket was sept 13 because of the gap roth hopes the 
car has already been towed but she doesnt know for sure 
another theory i thought maybe somebody else stole the plate 
and the car its on is being parked somewhere where its not 
getting tickets

for years walls throughout germany 
were spraypainted with graffiti telling us troops to go home 
now that major troop pullouts in the cold wars aftermath are 
granting that wish many germans are finding out just what the 
homeward trek will mean for their nation 
thousands of local civilian workers have been picketing us 
bases protesting the loss of their jobs and underscoring the 
impact of the pullout on local economies 
members of the oetv public service and transport union working 
for nato forces based in western germany held a third day of 
warning strikes on wednesday to demand protection from expected 
layoffs 
germans employed by the military have been jolted by recent 
announcements of pullouts the united states plans to send home 
40000 troops 
another blow came in secretary of defense dick cheneys nov 9 
announcement that one of two us army corps or an estimated 
100000 us military personnel in germany would be sent to saudi 
arabia to beef up the multinational forces 
the union says the reductions mean that up to 23000 of the 
100000 civilian employees working for the us british and other 
nato forces are expected to be laid off in the near future 
in the city of zweibruecken about 90 miles southwest of 
frankfurt mayor werner von blon says the planned closure of the 
us air force base there will badly hurt the town of 63000 
about 10000 service members and their families from the us 
army and air force live at the base blon said and between 1600 
and 1700 germans from the town work for the us military 
originally us officials said the base would be closed by 
1993 now that has been suddenly moved up to september 1991 its 
too short a time for us to do something to make up for the 
closure said blon 
he said a military survey showed the base brought in 946 
million a year to the city 
unlike large cities like frankfurt zweibruecken has no shortage 
of housing the mayor said 
about 600 americans rent homes on the local economy it wont 
be easy for the landlords to find new renters here blon said 
he suggested the us military keep the base and move in troops 
from crowded cities like frankfurt and mannheim 
the oetv union said wednesday that a total of 23000 civilians 
working for the us military and other nato forces held twohour 
warning strikes over the past three days at bases throughout the 
country 
the strike would not be continued because the military appeared 
ready to negotiate said oetvs deputy chief wolfgang warburg 
during the 1980s when hundreds of thousands of people took to 
the streets to protest the deployment of usbuilt pershing ii and 
cruise nuclear missiles in germany buildings throughout the 
country often bore the spraypainted slogan ami go home 
warburg laughed about the old graffiti that is now 
forgotten he said 
he said the union welcomed disarmament but needs time for the 
workers to find alternative jobs the union also wants guarantees 
of retraining for the thousands of civilians who will lose their 
jobs he said 
he said many of the civilians have worked for the military most 
of their adult lives 
military officials have said that the strikes have not 
interfered with their operations of deployment of troops and 
hardware to the persian gulf

the symptoms appeared in the spring half a 
dozen lumps about the size of peach pits on the prisoners neck 
after nearly 10 years in jail democracy activist xu wenli shows 
signs of lymphatic tuberculosis said his wife kang tong his 
sentence runs five more years but she is appealing to chinas 
leaders to release him early on humanitarian grounds 
he suffers from malnutrition many of his teeth have fallen 
out she said in an interview this week they shouldnt treat a 
person this way 
xu 47 is one of chinas bestknown democracy activists a 
precursor of last years student protesters his case has been 
championed by amnesty international 
kang said the cause of xus lumps has not been diagnosed because 
he refuses to allow the prison doctor to take a blood sample 
the needles are reused and he is afraid of catching a 
communicable disease kang said but she said the prison doctor 
prescribed antitubercular medicine and a doctor she consulted 
outside prison agreed that the symptoms could indicate 
tuberculosis 
when deng xiaoping became chinas paramount leader in 1978 and 
proposed economic and political reforms xu was one of many chinese 
who rushed to offer suggestions in magazine articles and posters 
tacked up on a streetside wall that was dubbed democracy wall 
xu an electrician and army veteran issued an unofficial 
journal from his beijing apartment called april fifth forum he 
wrote that a multiparty system and public supervision of the 
leadership could help avert disastrous policies such as the radical 
leftism of the 196676 cultural revolution 
he was arrested in 1981 and convicted of trying to undermine 
socialism and the communist party xu maintains his innocence and 
says he was merely trying to help the party improve itself a kind 
of loyal dissent that has a long tradition in imperial china 
kang and their daughter who is 17 still live in the same 
apartment kang a slightly built woman whose neatly curled hair is 
starting to gray teaches accounting at a vocational high school 
she said she also has been ill doctors diagnosed her as having a 
nonmalignant brain tumor 
she said she has learned caution over 10 years of being labeled 
a counterrevolutionarys relative but she said publicizing 
xus illness was one way to bring her plea to the attention of the 
authorities 
kang acknowledged it could backfire i seem calm but im 
afraid they might watch us more closely 
xus chances of winning early release are hurt by his refusal to 
admit guilt kang said she wont ask him to 
hes very earnest she said during her monthly 20minute 
visit with xu in october at beijings no 1 prison a guard asked 
xu if he acknowledged his crime 
he said i committed no crime i never opposed the party 
kang recounted 
admission of guilt is considered extremely important in the 
chinese penal system and an unrepentant prisoner may have his 
sentence lengthened 
still kang is encouraged by improvements in xus treatment 
although he remains in solitary confinement he has been moved from 
a cell so tiny he could not stand to one that has 9 square feet of 
walking space 
xu was put in the small cell in 1985 after he smuggled out of 
prison an essay defending himself kang said she was unsure how 
long he remained there 
his diet like that of other prisoners has almost no meat and 
few vegetables kang said prison rules set the food budget for each 
prisoner at 711 per month 
some participants of last years massive prodemocracy protests 
have been sentenced to long jail terms hundreds more remain jailed 
awaiting trial but hundreds also have been released giving kang 
hope 
my argument is this he never said the communist party was not 
good or that he wanted to hurt the party there is nothing he can 
reform and its already 10 years she said

with international approval for military 
force against iraq increasingly possible middle east analysts are 
focusing on a key question could saddam hussein stay in power if 
he loses kuwait 
publicly at least saddam has insisted that he would fight to 
the finish rather than relinquish the oilrich emirate he invaded 
on aug 2 
but his private assessment of whether his political career would 
survive a bloody clash with a usled force or an ignoble retreat 
could shape his next steps in the persian gulf crisis 
the united states says it has gathered enough votes to win 
approval of a un security council resolution authorizing a 
multinational army to oust iraq from kuwait the council was 
expected to vote on the measure on thursday 
saddam hasnt given any clear signal about what his intentions 
are said richard murphy a former us assistant secretary of 
state and now senior fellow for the middle east at the council on 
foreign relations in new york 
the best we have is that the soviets indicated he is not as 
adamant about holding onto kuwait in private as he is in public 
murphy said 
he said saddam has been faced with two questions how determined 
is the united states to dislodge him from kuwait and can he 
survive a war better than he can survive a peaceful withdrawal 
it would be extremely difficult for saddam to maintain his 
grip on power if he reverses course on kuwait said analyst 
philip robins of londons royal institute of international affairs 
robins noted that saddam conceded to iranian peace demands not 
long after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
part of the deal seen as a move to free his eastern front and 
restore ties with his moslem neighbor was sharing the 
shattalarab waterway once iraqs only outlet to the sea 
kuwait which he has declared iraqs 19th province provides 
saddam with a port if he loses that as well that would be a 
major foreign policy reverse robins said 
but most analysts agree that saddams chances of survival are 
greater if he gives ground without war he has few worries when it 
comes to public opinion in iraq or opposition from the countrys 
rubberstamp parliament 
personally i think he can survive said murphy 
saddam has survived several assassination attempts and at least 
seven attempted coups since he took power in 1979 
he has no serious rival and no obvious heir has emerged those 
known nationally owe their positions to their loyalty to him 
religious figures appeal only to their own constituencies robins 
said 
saddam regularly purges his officer corps to prevent moves 
against him and has been careful to ensure that military heroes 
are eliminated at least from positions of strength 
my judgment on the army is that he has a pretty firm hand on 
the highcommand level the senior officers said bernard 
trainor a former us marine general with knowledge of the iraqi 
military 
senior officers are totally under control either out of fear 
or devotion or both said trainor now head of the national 
security program at harvard universitys kennedy school of 
government 
trainor added however that there could be a considerable 
threat from the elite republican guard and other sections of the 
military if an overwhelming air strike inflicted heavy casualties 
on iraqi forces in kuwait and damaged the military and industrial 
infrastructure 
if these forces feel theyre on the way to national suicide 
there would be some inclination to remove saddam trainor said 
most foreign envoys who have traveled to baghdad have told 
saddam that the multinational force will be used against him some 
230000 us troops make up the bulk of the 300000strong force 
and president bush says 200000 more us troops will be in place 
by january 
what position iraq will take after the un security council 
votes on the useofforce resolution vote is uncertain 
only saddam hussein can give the answer to that and im not 
sure even he knows it trainor said

silent movies disappeared more than 70 years 
ago but nobody has bothered to tell theater organist ray 
brubacher 
the plump rosycheeked brubacher has performed as a oneman 
orchestra for screenings of silent film classics at the american 
film institute theater in the kennedy center for the past two 
decades 
im never at a loss for music says brubacher a master of 
improvisation who can play for hours at a stretch without following 
a score 
whether hes setting the syrupy mood for a wordless greta garbo 
embrace or creating musical chaos for a keystone kops chase scene 
brubacher pulls out all the stops 
until the silent film era was doomed in 1927 when al jolson 
spoke a few lines in the jazz singer even the smallest towns 
boasted a movie theater with a pipe organ for musical 
accompaniment with somebody like ray brubacher at the console 
today says brubacher there are only four theater organists 
left in the united states three of them travel the country giving 
occasional organ recitals and playing at silent film festivals 
brubacher says hes the only surviving resident organist at a movie 
theater 
growing up in washington brubacher began a lifetime 
fascination with pipe organs at age 6 at his mothers church as 
a teenager he improvised piano music for 8 millimeter reels of 
silent films he had bought with his allowance he thrilled to the 
sounds of the mighty wurlitzer at the capitol theater in downtown 
washington 
the capitol stopped presenting stage shows along with its movies 
in the mid1950s and the wurlitzer fell silent the theater was 
demolished in 1963 many theater organs across the country were 
sold to private collectors 
brubacher earns his living giving piano and organ lessons at his 
suburban maryland home he is the proud owner of a 1139pipe 
aeolian concert organ that once belonged to composer sigmund 
romberg 
when the afi theater opened 20 years ago brubacher signed on as 
organist his first assignment was playing impromptu music for 
broken blossoms a 1919 film by dw griffith starring lillian 
gish 
brubacher 50 says hes provided organ accompaniment for more 
than 1000 silent films over the past 20 years from charlie 
chaplin comedies to a greta garbo festival to a series of obscure 
soviet propaganda films about collective farms 
it was tough coming up with my international harvester music 
for all those tractors he said 
his most demanding performance was supplying six hours of organ 
music for a revival of abel gances 1925 film napoleon most 
of french composer arthur honeggers original score had been lost 
but brubacher found photocopies of 35 pages and improvised the rest 
with snatches of period french military and folk music 
because its limited space cannot accommodate a theater pipe 
organ the afi theater uses a conn electronic organ but brubacher 
says he can manipulate its 50 stops to produce just about any 
effect he wants from a symphony orchestra to the ratatat of a 
machine gun or the hissing of a steam locomotive 
brubacher prefers to keep his eyes on the screen rather than 
burying his nose in a musical score so he wont miss any of the 
action and he says its more difficult to play for a buster keaton 
or harold lloyd comedy than for a heavy dramatic film 
the love scenes are much easier because i can weave in a lot 
of classical themes he said but the comedies all those 
pratfalls and chases and custard pies in the face theres just so 
much funny stuff you can play before it gets boring

a texas congressman who represents more 
mesquite trees than people has persuaded congress that the stubborn 
and spindly pest has profit potential 
the thorny tree which defies bulldozers and herbicides and 
soaks up scarce ground water has long been the bane of ranchers 
across the southwest 
rep kika de la garza however believes a cash crop could be 
wrestled out of the dense thickets of mesquite that have taken over 
millions of acres of texas farm and rangeland 
under legislation sponsored by de la garza and included in the 
1990 farm bill the agriculture department is to conduct a research 
program to develop better production methods and commercial uses 
for mesquite 
the bill signed into law wednesday by president bush also 
authorizes 500000 over five years in research grants to develop 
ways of producing mesquite for use in flooring furniture or other 
items and to improve production and harvesting techniques 
mesquite is so abundant however that some texas and ranchers 
are happy just to give it away 
the raw material is virtually unlimited with 55 million acres 
of mesquite timber in the state of which only about 10000 cres 
are now commercially exploited according to the texas department 
of agriculture 
as many as 4500 trees can grow on an acre of pasture which 
means that there could be as many as 25 billion mesquite trees in 
the state the state agriculture department said in a recent 
report 
while mesquite chips are popular for grilling the demand hasnt 
made a dent in the supply according to herman mayeux range 
scientist for the usda agricultural research services grasslands 
soil and water research laboratory in temple 
some ranchers are getting about 10 a cord or 50 an acre for 
cookingwood mesquite in other parts of texas theyre not getting 
a penny and theyre just glad to get rid of it mayeux said 
while mesquite has been used in flooring and furniture in some 
of texas major ranch houses museums and even the us embassy in 
riyadh saudi arabia it hasnt been widely used for furniture and 
flooring officials said 
mesquite is described as a beautiful wood with a striking 
swirling grain but using it for furniture and flooring is 
difficult because the logs are short small and crooked mayeux 
said 
the problem is that no one has been able to envision a use 
although theyve thought about it and thought about it he said 
its difficult to envision a use envision a product that would 
be highly desirable in large quantities 
we have the crop we have to figure out a way to make it 
useful says peter felker who has been studying mesquite since 
1977 mesquite has a lot of potential domestically and 
internationally 
felker project leader for semiarid forest resources at texas 
aampi university in kingsville is looking at ways of improving 
harvesting techniques to produce larger logs hes also working 
with sawyers to mill the lumber for use in furniture picture 
frames and flooring the problem he says is that theres no 
forest industry in south texas home of much of the mesquite 
were trying to create the industry and develop a market for 
it he said 
the very characteristics that make the mesquite a bane to the 
farmer and rancher also make the trees attractive for development 
as an alternative timber crop the texas agriculture department 
said the wood is excellent as a cooking fuel for meats and fish 
and is increasing in popularity as an ornamental tree 
felker also is interested in developing a harvester to harvest 
the wood to burn as fuel as well as developing a marketing plan 
touting mesquite and beef 
the most profitable use however would be expanding the 
furniture and flooring market mesquite sold for fuel is worth 25 
a ton as mesquite chips its worth 300 a ton and as flooring and 
furniture 3000 a ton he said

the first nationwide survey of aids at colleges 
shows that the virus has gained a small by worrisome foothold on 
americas campuses infecting about one in every 500 students 
based on this and other data the federal centers for disease 
control estimates that between 25000 and 35000 of the nations 13 
million college students are infected with the aids virus 
that makes aids about as common on university campuses as it is 
elsewhere in american life the study shows 
this is both good news and bad news said leighton ku a 
public health specialist at the urban institute in washington 
its good that its not skyhigh as some might have feared but 
its bad that its there at all 
while its presence among college students is still small 
experts fear aids could spread substantially 
i think probably the most important thing from this study is 
that it shows us the potential said dr richard p keeling of 
the american college health association a coauthor the 
combination of a sexually transmitted disease tossed into campus 
behavior has the potential for very serious consequences in the 
future it also shows us we have an opportunity to prevent that 
the study was based on random testing of blood samples drawn 
from 16863 students at 19 schools most of them large state 
universities thirty students or twotenths of 1 percent of the 
total were found to be infected all but two were men 
among other results of the study published in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
the infection rate was half of 1 percent for men and 
twohundredths of 1 percent in women 
those over age 24 were seven times more likely than younger 
students to be infected 
at 10 of the 19 campuses the survey turned up no aids 
infections 
keeling said the study underscores the need for students to use 
condoms limit their number of sexual partners and otherwise reduce 
risky behavior 
keeling who also runs the student health service at the 
university of virginia said many students believe aids wont 
affect them 
other factors that may increase its spread include widespread 
casual sex among college students a lack of safe sex practices and 
the frequent combination of sex while drinking which makes people 
less cautious 
however ku participated in a recent study that found that 
condom use among teenagers has doubled over the past decade 
young people are aware of aids and are doing things to prevent 
aids ku said 
dr steven weinstein of the university of massachusetts medical 
center recommended more intensive programs by colleges to change 
students behavior and attitudes toward sex drugs and alcohol 
we want to create a new milieu on campus where safer sex is 
the in thing and it is unacceptable to be blitzed out of your 
mind he said 
the blood samples analyzed had been drawn for other purposes at 
student health centers even though the researchers promised not to 
reveal aids rates at individual campuses keeling said many schools 
refused to participate because they feared being labeled as an 
aids college 
taking part in the survey were central missouri state 
university emory university mississippi state university 
northwestern university rutgers university san diego state 
university southern illinois university university of california 
at berkeley university of colorado university of connecticut at 
storrs university of georgia university of kansas university of

the pentagon is looking for a few good ships 
complete with swimming pools bars and enough beds to sleep at 
least 600 troops 
in a new twist to its efforts to provide recreation to the 
thousands of troops deployed in and around saudi arabia the 
military hopes to hire cruise ships as floating rampr spots and 
wants to get them dockside in the region by years end 
tuesday was the deadline for sending bids to the defense 
departments military sealift command and shipping industry 
officials say a number of proposals were submitted 
a military spokeswoman confirmed that much but said she could 
not provide additional details until she received clearance from 
the pentagons central command which is in charge of us forces 
in the middle east 
alcohol is illegal in saudi arabia and rowdy music and dancing 
is frowned upon in the islamic culture as well leaving the 
military with few local options for rampr 
and none of the neighboring countries that allows drinking and 
reveling is willing or able to serve thousands of airmen soldiers 
and sailors most of whom would be getting their first break in 
months 
owners of ships that would meet the pentagons specifications 
also are a bit wary of taking on the job according to industry 
officials 
an official of a consulting firm serving as an intermediary for 
several steamship companies that explored the pentagon proposal 
said he knew of several proposals submitted by the tuesday deadline 
and had spoken with other brokers who said they submitted bids as 
well 
the interest has been varied because there could be some 
risks said the official who spoke on condition that neither he 
nor his company be identified 
the owners are also concerned about the wear and tear on ships 
and also about taking them out of the itinerary for future cruise 
service so its not likely that many of the modern ships are going 
to be looking for this type of job the official said 
the commander of us forces in the region army gen h norman 
schwarzkopf said in september that chartering cruise ships would 
allow troops to relax and dance and have music and air 
conditioning and swimming pools and just sort of live it up 
the pentagons request for bids said the ships should be able to 
hold at least 600 passengers provide full hotel services 
including food bar service and entertainment and have 
englishspeaking crews 
the specifications said priority would be given to vessels 
flying the us flag but that bids would be accepted from ships 
registered elsewhere most major cruise liners are of foreign 
registry 
the pentagon said it wanted to get ships to bahrain by 
middecember and would charter them for periods of up to six 
months bahrain is an island emirate in the persian gulf connected 
to saudi arabia by a 12mile causeway 
the pentagon has ships and aircraft stationed in bahrain as part 
of its deployment in the gulf region

the measure chinas top envoy qian qichen said his country would 
not back the resolution either

council and could veto the measure but at the united nations 
diplomats said they didnt expect such a move and predicted the 
resolution would pass

regarding kuwait 
baker asked that foreign ministers represent their countries at 
thursdays security council vote 
before leaving beijing on wednesday chinas qian said his 
country would not back the useofforce resolution 
un diplomats were divided over whether china would abstain or 
eventually vote in favor after wringing political concessions out 
of washington 
it seems rather clear that theyre not thinking of vetoing 
said british ambassador david hannay 
oil prices were stable wednesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange with many traders waiting for the security council vote 
in washington federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
soaring oil prices are in part responsible for substantially 
weakening the american economy he said economic growth probably 
would be negative in the octoberdecember quarter 
gephardt said washington should stick to sanctions 
stay the course do not try to mount an offensive military 
action in the near future the missouri democrat said in a 
speech 
iraqs ramadan said bush is leading the entire world to a 
ruinous war and has no choice other than to come to his senses 
and initiate a dialogue 
about 230000 us soldiers are stationed in saudi arabia as 
part of the 330000strong multinational force arrayed against 
iraq 
iraq holds hundreds of westerners as human shields at key 
military and civilian installations

cuba on wednesday rejected a us appeal that it 
support a resolution in the united nations authorizing the use of 
force to liberate kuwait from iraqi invaders 
the text that we have before us in not acceptable foreign 
minister isidoro malmierca said after a 90minute evening meeting 
with secretary of state james a baker iii 
the meeting was the highestlevel uscuban formal session in 
more than 30 years 
baker was trying to line up a unanimous vote thursday in the 
security council to approve force against iraq if its 450000 
troops do not pull out by jan 15 
malmierca told reporters we are confident that these 
consultations could bring modifications to that text so that it 
could be accepted 
but a senior us official speaking on conditioan of anonymity 
said no such consultations were under way he said the cuban was 
simply expressing his own hopes 
bakers meeting with malmierca in a midtown hotel completes a 
cycle baker has now met with all 14 nations that are on the 
council with the united states 
malmierca commented wednesday night as he was going into his 
talks with baker we cuba want to contribute to a political 
solution in the gulf 
at this point he said we dont construe the resolution 
contributing to such a solution 
cuba also is a member of the security council it does not have 
full diplomatic relations with the united states 
former secretary of state george p shultz met briefly and 
informally with malmierca in new york two years ago at the 
conclusion of negotiations to remove cuban troops from angola 
there also was a secret unofficial 1981 meeting in mexico 
between secretary of state alexander haig and the cuban vice 
president 
but state department officials said bakers meeting with the 
foreign minister was of a formal nature it is believed to be the 
highestlevel session with a cuban official since thenvice

to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait which it seized on aug 2 
a vote on the possible use of force against iraqi president 
saddam hussein is expected on thursday when baker presides over 
the 15nation security council 
the administration is believed to have a clear majority for 
passage but to give the resolution the greatest force baker 
wanted to persuade malmierca to back military action too 
baker flew here from washington and met first with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze at the soviet mission 
he met at midnight with chinese foreign minister qian qichen 
asked if he had chinas support baker declined to reply qian also 
refused to answer questions before the meeting began 
china one of the five permanent members of the security 
council has said it wont back the measure although us 
officials have said beijing has notified washington it will not 
veto the resolution 
the chinese government has said it is against the use of force 
which leaves open the possibility of abstention 
shevardnadze meanwhile told reporters we want to prevent a 
military clash that would be the worst possibility 
he said he expected a positive vote on the us resolution 
to authorize force which has soviet support 
baker struck a compromise with shevardnadze earlier in the week 
delaying the deadline on iraq from jan 1 to jan 15 in part to 
allow mre time for conciliatory actions

without developing them 
a voice said this is the us immigration and naturalization 
service you are in violation but the three changed from 
jumpsuits to sharp bright suits and did a dance in broadway style 
adding latinstyle hip shaking then they began crossing their 
ankles before they spun around which looked even more latin 
when iglesias sang they danced with big sweeping gestures and 
romantic glides often miming dancing with women

thousands of poor and disabled children will 
become eligible for government benefits under a 25 billion bush 
administration plan completed this week 
the plan required by a supreme court ruling nine months ago 
would bring supplemental security income benefits to additional 
youngsters with severe physical and mental disabilities 
administration officials say as many as 37000 children would 
become eligible annually the expansion results from a 
courtordered broadening of the way disability applications are 
evaluated 
more than 310000 needy disabled children currently receive ssi 
benefits averaging 387 per month about half the applicants 
qualify but officials expect that figure to rise to as high as 65 
percent under the new plan 
the social security administration this week sent the 200page 
plan to philadelphia attorneys who have filed suit asking 
eligibility for thousands of disabled children 
jonathan stein one of the attorneys expressed hope the plan 
put an end to cases such as one involving jennifer cox a 
secondgrader from iowa city 
she has twice been denied benefits despite kidney bowel and 
bladder problems and a lack of peripheral vision said virginia 
stratton aide to rep david nagle diowa 
what is this for if not to help people like this stratton 
said 
the supreme court on feb 20 in a 72 decision voided a 
regulation under fire as unfair to children it denied benefits to 
youngsters not suffering from specific ailments named on a 
government list 
looser standards applied to adults for example if they were 
judged unable to work they became eligible the new plan will 
enable authorities deciding whether to grant benefits to consider 
the impact of disability on the daily lives of the youngsters 
since the decision the administration has been using a 
temporary standard under which each childs abilities must be 
assessed 
ssa officials said wednesday that the changes subject to a 
public comment period could cost 25 billion to 35 billion over 
the next five years 
the court decision also means the government must reevaluate 
the cases of at least 280000 children rejected under the old 
criteria ssa estimates that could cost an additional 3 billion 
backers of the plan are pushing the administration to move 
faster they note officials have yet to begin hunting for 
youngsters rejected earlier 
stein questioned the administrations commitment to securing the 
money to get moving with the plan 
we are very surprised that no effort has been made to seek 
a supplemental appropriation from congress stein said 
sen john heinz rpa said the administration had adopted a 
minimalist response to the publics interest in the case 
the law says poor disabled children are entitled to public 
support heinz said it is not the prerogative of the 
administration to decide a congressionally mandated program is too 
expensive and stall on implementation in the interest of 
savings 
social security administration commissioner gwendolyn king 
however said she was committed to turning this around 
we have to start somewhere she said i would start by 
asking for anywhere from 100 million to 125 million there isnt 
an obstacle that should hold us back from doing what we have to do 
these kids have already waited more than enough time

californians hoping for an end to their 
drought will find scant comfort in the governments new winter 
forecast which gives them only a 5050 chance of a wet winter 
and the news is even worse for the energydependent east with 
the national weather service calling for colder than normal 
conditions over the next 90 days 
winter is the rainy season for the west coast and the mountain 
snowpack there provides much of the water for the rest of the year 
californians have been hoping for a snowy winter to break drought 
conditions going back three to four years 
but dr robert livezey of the federal climate analysis center 
reported wednesday that the conditions seem likely to produce a 
stationary high pressure area over california and the southwest 
when such centers form they can block incoming moisture from the 
pacific ocean he explained on the other hand if the center 
weakens storms could come ashore hence californias 50 percent 
chance of wet or dry winter weather 
the colder than normal forecast for the east could cause 
problems if oil supplies become short because of the middle east 
crisis but livezey declined to discuss the potential energy 
impact 
he did point out that a forecast for colder than normal weather 
implies an average of a degree or two below the usual readings but 
that could occur as periods of severe cold rather than being cooler 
on average he noted 
the general forecast for the three winter months calls for cold 
east of the mississippi with the region of highest likelihood 
focused along the appalachian mountains in west virginia 
tennessee kentucky virginia and north carolina 
california and arizona have the greatest chance of above normal 
readings and a broad strip running northsouth through the center 
of the country has equal chances of warmer or colder than normal 
conditions 
livezey said there is a potential for wetter than normal weather 
easing droughts in the southeast and in oregon 
the wetter than average conditions are forecast for the gulf 
coast and southeast in general and for washington and oregon a 
drier than usual region is expected in the central part of the 
nation extending south and west to new mexico and arizona 
in addition to california there is a 5050 chance of being 
either wet or dry in new england and the middle atlantic region 
livezey explained that a warm region in the central pacific 
ocean is expected to increase the looping effect of the jet stream 
the highspeed upper air current that helps guide weather patterns 
around the world 
that should result in storms moving north into washington and 
oregon from the pacific and pulling warm air north into the 
southwest this wind then is likely to turn back to the south in 
the nations midsection pulling cold canadian air into the eastern 
states 
livezey noted that last years forecast for a warmer than normal

chewing gum in school is not just ok around 
here its required 
some 4000 elementary school students in polk county will take 
part in a twoyear study on sugarless gum and cavities 
were certainly not going to have to fight to get kids to do 
this said stephen white principal of hillcrest elementary 
school in lake wales one of 13 polk county schools participating 
in the university of florida study 
the schools teachers who have been telling students for years 
to spit out that gum agreed to the study after a presentation 
tuesday by anthony j conti a professor of dentistry 
research has shown that sugarless gum prevents tooth decay in 
children by reducing plaque conti said the study will compare two 
sugar substitutes used in gum sorbitol and xylitol 
starting next week the students will be required to chew gum 
for 10 minutes each day at school as well as at home participants 
will receive toothbrushes and annual dental checkups at no cost to 
parents 
the university also will donate 325000 to the schools and the 
school districts scholarship fund conti said 
the students are good test subjects because drinking water in 
the central florida county lacks fluoride which also prevents 
cavities he said

lower farm prices for major commodities such 
as milk eggs and poultry will be a big factor in slowing the 1991 
rise in consumer food costs says an agriculture department 
economist 
larger supplies of farmproduced foods will have a strong 
influence on food prices in 1991 ralph l parlett jr told the 
departments annual outlook conference on wednesday 
the farm value of food that portion of the consumer dollar 
which goes to farmers is expected to average nearly 6 percent 
below 1990 he said 
parletts comments followed the usdas forecast on tuesday that 
consumer food prices in 1991 would climb only 2 percent to 5 
percent compared to a 6 percent gain this year 
that 6 percent gain plus an increase of 58 percent in 1989 
represent the sharpest backtoback increases since an 86 percent 
jump in 1980 followed by a rise of 78 percent in 1981 
after that burst food prices rose mostly at an annual rate of 2 
percent to 4 percent until the last two years 
parlett said farm prices costs of processing and distribution 
and consumer demand are the three major factors affecting food 
prices and all have played a role this year 
farm prices were pushed up in 1990 because of tight supplies 
of some farm commodities he said costs beyond the farm gate 
for processing and distributing food increased about 7 percent 
reflecting increased use of inputs and higher input prices 
also consumer demand for food remained relatively strong in the 
first half of 1990 although parlett said decreasing real 
disposable income in the second half has probably dampened that 
demand 
looking at the new forecast for 1991 parlett said it involves a 
number of uncertainties about the general economy and the crisis in 
the persian gulf but larger supplies of some commodities 
including dairy products and poultry will keep the overall price 
average from soaring 
in any case a slowdown of the economy will have a dampening 
effect on retail prices he said declines in personal income 
weaken consumer demand and reduces inflationary pressure on 
prices 
parlett said higher oil prices will have a limited effect on 
the costs of processing and distributing foods next year 
retail prices of beef and pork have been at record levels this 
year rising about 7 percent and 14 percent respectively from 
1989 
in 1991 beef supplies are expected to remain about level with 
1990 but pork supplies are expected to expand slightly parlett 
said as a result prices for red meats in 1991 will not rise 
nearly as much as in 1990 
poultry prices overall are forecast to drop next year by as 
much as 5 percent from 1990 dairy products which climbed 9 
percent this year may rise no more than 2 percent in 1991 or even 
decline by 2 percent 
 
washington ap the agriculture department urges consumers to 
think safety when buying mailorder food for the holidays 
many consumers mistakenly think that because a meat or poultry 
product is vacuum packaged canned or smoked it doesnt need 
refrigeration advises sue templin of the departments food 
safety and inspection service 
in fact she said wednesday most of these products must 
be refrigerated consumers should check the label or ordering 
information to see if refrigeration is required 
templin who manages the agencys tollfree consumer hotline 
said mailorder companies are responsible for shipping perishable 
meat and poultry products safely often using frozen gel packs or 
dry ice and insulated containers to keep products below 40 degrees 
fahrenheit during shipment 
food technologist robert savage said turkeys hams and other 
meats are smoked for flavor not preservation country hams on the 
other hand have a high salt content and are dry these are safe at 
room temperature for up to a year if uncooked and unsliced 
also he said hard dry sausages or processed cheeses can be 
kept at room temperatures for four to six weeks if unopened but 
some do require refrigeration 
questions about food safety for mailorder gifts may be referred 
to the departments meat and poultry hotline weekdays from 10 am 
to 4 pm est at 18005354555 in the washington dc area 
call 2024473333 
 
washington ap doc watsons nose has proved effective in a 
pilot program to sniff out fruit in the honolulu post office that 
is being illegally mailed to the mainland says the agriculture 
department 
doc watson is an elite member of the departments beagle 
brigade a band of dogs put to work some years ago to sniff 
arriving overseas luggage at us airports to detect illegal fruit 
meat and other items that might contain harmful agricultural pests 
the us mail is a different challenge 
a 1989 federal law prohibits the mailing of forbidden fruit but 
usda officials in honolulu had to seek criminal warrants to search 
suspected parcels headed for the mainland 
so doc watson last may was called in as part of a pilot program 
to narrow the odds of finding contraband 
the departments animal and plant health inspection service said 
that as of oct 31 the beagle had sniffed out 477 illegal parcels 
of produce 
overall the take weighed 4229 pounds and included 177 
interceptions of fruit flies foreign weeds diseases and other 
exotic pests 
some fruits sniffed out by doc watson are small a few 
miniature oranges mailed with other goods the agency said 
some finds are huge like a 30pound jackfruit that outweighed 
doc by about 10 pounds

settling down in the witness stand the old 
admiral told the senators that his wife asked him as he was leaving 
home i thought you were retired when are we going to actually 
retire around here 
crowe told the senate armed services committee at hearings 
wednesday into the crisis in the persian gulf and the 
possibilities that america will be drawn into war that one 
advantage of being retired is that he is free to speak his mind 
born in kentucky in 1925 crowe retired in 1989 as chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff under president reagan 
an unusual sailor he took leave of the navy to obtain a 
masters degree in education from stanford university in 1956 and 
turned down an invitation from adm hyman rickover to join his 
nuclear submarine program so he could earn a phd in politics at 
princeton in 1965 
his view of the iraqi crisis is one of wariness i counsel 
patience he told the senators war is not neat its not tidy 
and once you resort to it its uncertain and its a mess 
some other views from his testimony 
on the effect of the embargo 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
given the standard of living iraq is used to and the 
increasing sophistication of iraqi society it is dead wrong to say 
that iraq is not being hurt it is being damaged severely it 
is the most effective peacetime blockade that i have personally 
witnessed 
the issue is not whether an embargo will work but whether we 
have the patience to let it take effect 
i personally believe they sanctions will bring him to his 
knees ultimately but i would be the first to admit that is a 
speculative judgment 
if in fact the sanctions will work in 12 to 18 months 
instead of six months the tradeoff of avoiding war with its 
attendant sacrifices and uncertainties would in my estimation be 
more than worth it

i genuinely believe we have already seen some the first 
subtle hints that saddam hussein is seeking a way out in other

hussein has excited the resentment contempt and suspicion of 
the nations he historically depended upon in essence under no 
circumstances can he return to the world he left of august the 2nd

the burning question now confronting the president as well as 
our public is what next this is not a mean question nor is it 
any easy one in its most extreme form we are talking about 
deliberately initiating offensive military operations in other 
words war war is always a grave decision and one which deserves 
both deep thought and wide public discussion 
on the mideast after saddam 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
put bluntly saddams departure or any other single act im 
afraid will not make everything wonderful income differences 
on both national and individual levels are a constant source of 
tensions and envy throughout the region moslem fundamentalism 
is spreading and the process highlights the cultural religious 
and ethic differences that are bound in the area as well as the 
widespread distrust of the west boundary disputes are legion and 
theyve been a part of the region for many years qatar vs 
bahrain abu dhabi vs oman and saudi arabia yemen vs saudi 
arabia kuwait vs iraq and many of the emirates vs iran us 
links to israel and the dominant position of american oil companies 
have turned large segments of the arab world against the us in 
particular 
on the larger question 
the critical foreign policy questions we must ask are not 
whether saddam hussein is a brutal deceitful or as barbara bush 
would put it a dreadful man he is all of those things but 
whether initiating conflict against iraq will moderate the larger 
difficulties in the gulf region and will put washington in a better 
position to work with the arabs the arab world in the future is 
in my estimation the more important question 
i would submit that posturing ourselves to promote stability 
for the long term is our primary national interest in the middle 
east may i repeat it that posturing ourselves to promote 
stability for the long term is our primary national interest in the 
middle east it is not obvious to me that we are currently looking 
at the crisis in this light 
our dislike for hussein seems to have crowded out many other 
considerations in working through the problems myself i am 
persuaded that the us initiating hostilities could well 
exacerbate many of the tensions i have cited and perhaps further 
polarize the arab world certainly many arabs would deeply resent a 
campaign which would necessarily kill large numbers of their moslem 
brothers and force them to choose sides between arab nations and 
the west

nasa confident this time will lead 
to liftoff began shuttle columbias countdown on thursday for a 
longoverdue astronomy mission 
the countdown clock began ticking for the fifth time at 1 
am est liftoff is scheduled for 128 am est sunday 
three of the four previous countdowns were halted during fueling 
by leaking hydrogen most recently in midseptember another was 
stopped because of problems with the 150 million observatory 
aboard the shuttle 
as of wednesday everything was going smoothly said bascom 
murrah a nasa official in charge of columbis prelaunch 
operations 
columbias really behaving everything looks real good 
murrah said 
the national aeronautics and space administration has been 
trying since late may to launch columbia with seven astronauts and 
the observatory called astro holes in plumbing between the 
orbiter and external tank were fixed last summer but leaks 
remained in the engine compartment and required additional repairs 
columbia was cleared for flight during a fueling test in 
october the shuttle atlantis also was found to be free of 
dangerous hydrogen leaks during a tanking test last month 
atlantis returned to earth last week following a secret military 
flight discovery completed a satellitedelivery mission in 
october few problems were reported on either trip 
if columbia goes up as planned it will be the first time since 
1985 that nasa has launched three shuttles in such quick 
succession murrah said the mood among workers as a result is the 
best its been in months 
it feels good you can see it start to peak people are 
happy murrah said 
during columbias 10day flight the four astronomers aboard 
will work in shifts to operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes 
and one xray telescope some of the hottest objects in the 
universe will be studied including a supernova 
we are doing fewer observations than initially planned said 
mission scientist ted gull but each observation is longer 
it will be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted 
entirely to scientific research the mission originally was 
scheduled for 1986 but was delayed when challenger exploded early

the white house is vigorously ringing alarm 
bells about iraqs nuclear capabilities but government and 
congressional experts are questioning the warnings and the evidence 
on which they are based 
president bush first raised the nuclear specter during a 
moraleboosting visit with us troops in saudi arabia on 
thanksgiving day standing within rocket range of iraqi troops 
bush said iraq is further along in its nuclear weapons program than 
was previously thought and that this lends a sense of urgency to 
the us mission in the gulf 
no one knows for sure when president saddam hussein will 
actually have a bomb but one thing is certain he has never 
possessed a weapon that he hasnt used bush said 
over the next few days the presidents aides amplified the 
message 
but as they talked other experts questioned the 
administrations interpretation of intelligence data 
the former head of the joint chiefs of staff retired adm 
william crowe told congress wednesday that recent reports of 
nearterm iraqi nuclear capability are not right they are 
exaggerated 
across town white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters bush had received briefings from intelligence officials 
that led him to conclude iraq had a nuclear capability that could 
come to fruition within months 
the administration shared this top secret information with some 
members of the united nations security council said one official 
in an apparent attempt to win votes for a resolution authorizing 
military force to remove iraq from kuwait 
when the international atomic energy agency announced this week 
that its inspectors visited nuclear sites in iraq but hadnt found 
any evidence of atomic weapons development the white house got 
angry 
we think the international atomic energy agency is wrong 
said fitzwater they see only what iraq wants them to see and we 
disagree we disagree quite strenuously 
his comments prompted other officials to point out that the iaea 
always inspects only what a host country allows it to the agency 
has no other pretensions said one official 
the presidents warnings of urgency on the matter surprised many 
experts who had previously predicted iraq was at least five to 10 
years away from having a readytobedelivered nuclear weapon 
in public and private administration officials stressed that 
they didnt believe iraq would have a nuclear arsenal in less than 
three years and probably closer to five or 10 
an intelligence assessment commissioned by the white house 
following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait did raise a new threat 
described as a worst case scenario that iraq could put 
together a crude nuclear device said several officials 
such a weapon probably composed of two tubes of nuclear 
material that would explode once the tubes were banged together 
would be highly inaccurate but it could cause nuclear fallout of 
the type induced in a reactor accident said one expert 
even defense secretary dick cheney expressed doubts about the 
effectiveness of such a device it wouldnt be anything you could 
deliver from an airplane it wouldnt be anything that would be 
weaponized he said in a television interview 
in the highly unlikely event that saddam decides to use such a 
weapon against us forces said one government expert he would 
risk killing as many of his troops as those of the enemy because of 
his inability to target the weapon precisely 
all experts agree iraq doesnt have the ability to enrich 
uranium that is to turn it into weaponsgrade explosives 
although it is working hard to obtain the necessary components and 
knowhow 
if iraq could import the technology materials and supplies 
it probably could produce weaponsgrade uranium and make crude 
but destructive nuclear bombs in perhaps five to 10 years said a 
report by the congressional research service 
cheney said iraq could seize the enriched uranium it now has 
that same material now under iaea safeguards and use it for one 
crude device 
but iraq would need at least 33 pounds of uranium while the 
quantity under iaea inspection is only 27 pounds said peter 
clausen a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the union of 
concerned scientists 
an israeli official agreed with the us assessment that iraq 
could assemble a primitive weapon but wondered whether saddam 
would risk the inevitable retaliation by the united states and its 
allies 
he would only have a oneshot deal with this one primitive 
weapon said the official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity

the kenyan government has detained many of its 
leading political opponents without trial and some have reported 
being tortured amnesty international charged in a report released 
today 
at least 20 people face trial simply for owning publications 
critical of the government the londonbased human rights 
organization said 
amnesty said the government action began four months ago when 
riot police beat teargassed and killed participants in 
demonstrations against the oneparty rule of president daniel arap 
moi 
police arrested at least 1500 demonstrators including 
politicians lawyers and journalists during the july protests it 
said 
some of those arrested since july have reportedly been 
tortured or illtreated and have been held in prisons with no 
access to medicine or their relatives poor food and sometimes 
permanently in solitary confinement the report says 
amnesty said it feared those facing trial could be sentenced to 
long jail terms 
many political prisoners have been sentenced to long prison 
terms in recent years after they were unlawfully detained denied 
lawyers and tortured to make them plead guilty it said 
the report says judges in political cases usually fail to 
investigate reports of torture or illegal detention 
it urges the government to release immediately all those 
arrested in july and anyone jailed for peacefully expressing 
their opinion 
amnesty said those arrested in july included kenneth matiba and 
charles rubia both former cabinet ministers and raila odinga son 
of kenyas former vicepresident oginga odinga who all favor a 
multiparty system of government 
former legislator george anyona arrested in july with three 
friends reported that they were being kept permanently handcuffed 
in dimly lit cells and given food which was unfit for human 
consumption the report says 
he said they had been stripped naked for interrogation and 
held in cells flooded with water a common torture method in kenya 
and sometimes nicknamed the swimming pool 
the four are due to be tried on sedition charges in january 
amnesty said 
the human rights organization said eight other activists 
including former legislator koigi wa wamwere had signed affidavits 
alleging torture 
arrested last month the eight are charged with treason and 
related offenses but have been denied proper access to lawers 
amnesty charged 
moi who came to power in 1978 has consistently rejected 
opposition calls for a multiparty system

nobody is arguing with cathy burns claim 
that police wrongly hypnotized her before charging her in the 
shootings of her two sons 
whether she can sue the prosecutor who advised police beforehand 
is the question confronting the us supreme court 
muncie authorities charged her in the 1982 shootings at her home 
after surmising from the questioning under hypnosis that burns 
suffered from multiple personality disorder and that a personality 
named katie shot the boys 
psychiatrists later determined she did not suffer from the 
disorder and the police department paid 250000 to settle a 
wrongful prosecution lawsuit she brought 
but she still wants to sue richard w reed the delaware county 
deputy prosecutor who counseled the officers in the bungled case 
the supreme court heard arguments wednesday and should rule by 
july whether a prosecutor can be held liable for recommending that 
police violate a persons rights 
what were arguing is that he actually directed the police at 
each critical stage of their investigation said burns lawyer 
michael k sutherlin if he had said dont do it they would 
have stopped 
while police have limited immunity from such lawsuits 
prosecutors nationwide have absolute immunity from lawsuits 
targeting actions taken in the performance of their official 
duties 
all charges against burns were dropped and the shooting remains 
unsolved evidence gathered with a search warrant that was obtained 
on the basis of the hypnosis confession was ruled inadmissable 
because the judge who issued the warrant wasnt told about the 
hypnosis 
we wanted to make absolutely positive that those children 
would be safe in the future and that they would not be put back 
into a home where they would be in jeopardy again said capt 
paul e cox muncie chief of detectives and one of the officers 
sued after the hypnosis whether or not justice was served 
thats what the court has to decide 
both boys survived the shootings eddie now 20 returned to his 
mothers custody in 1985 she still does not have custody of denny 
15 
she remarried about a year after her release from a psychiatric 
ward where doctors concluded she did not have a split personality 
during the shooting probe cox and his partner donald 
scroggins now muncies police chief were stumped in the 
investigation even though burns had submitted to a lie detector 
test the officers asked her to undergo hypnosis 
but cox remembered from training that hypnotizing suspects is 
unacceptable the officers asked reed for advice 
i said yes if youve got nowhere else to go you might as 
well do that reed recalled 
reed the countys newly elected chief prosecutor blamed 
himself for not letting the judge hearing the search warrant 
request know about the hypnosis 
i wasnt very careful in examining officer scroggins on the 
witness stand he said it looked like i misled the court 
the mistake prevented police from using as evidence a halloween 
mask wig and coveralls found in the burns house that matched 
burns description of the attacker 
a federal judge ruled the prosecutor was immune from her 
lawsuit but sutherlin hopes to revive her claim with help from the 
supreme court 
indiana deputy attorney general david a nowak who is 
representing reed said limiting immunity would force prosecutors 
to defend themselves against so many lawsuits they couldnt do 
their jobs 
while it might eliminate the avenue of relief for someone like 
mrs burns who arguably has a valid claim it also limits the many 
frivolous claims that would be filed by criminal defendants 
nowak said 
justice department lawyer michael lazerwitz argued wednesday 
that prosecutors will be less willing to share their expertise with 
police if they risk being sued

the vatican has sent milwaukee archbishop 
rembert weakland a rare letter of apology for denying him an 
honorary degree from a swiss university because of his commentary 
on abortion 
i deeply regret the pain that you have suffered i share it 
with you and i sincerely assure you of my prayers that the wound so 
inadvertently caused will be healed archbishop pio laghi head 
of the vaticans congregation of education wrote last week 
laghi also apologized for not consulting with weakland before 
withholding approval of the degree from the university of fribourg 
and for the way the action was interpreted as a rebuke of the 
archbishop 
the vatican did not rescind the veto of the degree and did not 
indicate weakland has been cleared of questions about his 
statements on abortion 
i greatly appreciate archbishop laghis words of clarification 
and support in this matter with his correspondence i consider the 
matter closed weakland said in a statement wednesday 
the universitys theology faculty is affiliated with the 
vatican which has the right to approve the awards it bestows 
in failing to approve the honorary degree for weaklands work in 
economics the vatican said he had taken positions on abortion 
which are not without doctrinal importance and which are causing 
a great deal of confusion amongst the faithful 
the archbishop has maintained the roman catholic churchs 
position against abortion but a statement he issued after a series 
of meetings with women last spring questioned actions of some 
abortion opponents and expressed concern about circumstances that 
lead to abortions 
laghi said the vaticans congregation for the doctrine of the 
faith was still evaluating the archbishops statement on abortion 
he said he withheld approval of the honorary degree because the 
evaluation was not completed 
i sincerely regret that that decision which this congregation 
took in prudent patience should have been so negatively 
perceived he said 
the rev adrian holderegger director of the swiss universitys 
institute of moral theology expressed surprise at the letter 
thats the first time ive heard of rome apologizing he

to lebanon after pulling out all us officials from beirut last 
year because of heavy fighting among rival lebanese militias 
ambassador ryan crocker arrived in beirut wednesday after a us 
security team inspected the situation in the lebanese capital last 
weekend said deputy state department spokesman richard boucher 
the state department wants to return additional diplomats to beirut 
once their security can be guaranteed he said 
the decision to send in crocker despite the stilltenuous 
security situation reflects the administrations strong support for 
the new government of elias hrawi which is trying to impose its

the case of the manuel noriega tapes casts a shadow 
over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his 
order blocking their broadcast a constitutional scholar says 
us district judge william hoeveler brought one legal battle 
between noriega and cable news network to a close wednesday when he 
lifted his 3weekold order barring cnn from airing tapes of the 
former dictators jailhouse phone calls 
rodney smolla head of the institute of bill of rights law at 
william and mary college in williamsburg va said he was 
disturbed that the us supreme court refused to intervene earlier 
to throw out the judges order and that the high court will not get 
another chance to review the order 
it died with a whimper and i think its unfortunate the case 
ended this way he said it left on the books precedents that 
cast some doubt on first amendment protections that many people 
thought were well settled 
noriegas attorneys said they will still ask for contempt 
penalties against cnn for broadcasting excerpts the day after 
hoevelers ban 
defense attorney frank rubino also has requested that all 
charges against noriega be dropped on grounds the taping a dispute 
over noriegas legal fees and other alleged government misconduct 
ruined his chances of a fair trial 
a decision on that request awaits among other things the 
outcome of an fbi investigation into how the tapes were leaked 
the judge lifted his order after he and attorneys reviewed 
transcripts of seven tapes the network submitted last week 
during wednesdays hearing rubino withdrew his request to stop 
the broadcasts saying the only tape that appeared to violate 
attorneyclient privilege already had been broadcast it does no 
good to close the barn door after the horse is out he said 
prosecutors also said they had no objection to lifting the ban 
again insisting noriegas rights were never violated by the taping 
later wednesday cnn broadcast portions of the previously aired 
tape spokesman steve haworth said the network had no immediate 
plans to air the others 
cnn president tom johnson said the judges decision would allow 
the network to pursue its story on the governments taping of 
noriegas conversations 
cnns coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this 
judicial prior restraint on press freedom he said 
scholars said the possible precedents from the case include 
allowing prior restraint of news reporting something most believed 
to be strictly prohibited by the first amendment 
the fact that the supreme court has tolerated this gag order 
for this length of time will unfortunately send a sign to judges 
and lawyers around the country that a little prior restraint is 
ok said jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press 
rubino said the drug enforcement administration or state 
department leaked the tapes to the government of panama which in 
turn gave them to cnn he said he wants the source of the leak 
identified 
we had to go along the road and put out fires now were 
going after the pyromaniacs that started the fires rubino said 
to head off more leaks hoeveler also ruled that the bureau of 
prisons which routinely records inmate conversations for security 
reasons cannot share any of noriegas tapes with other agencies 
without the judges permission 
the tape that touched off the dispute was of a conversation 
between noriega and one of rubinos investigators with the 
lawyers spanishspeaking secretary serving as an interpreter in 
the conversation noriega is asked about two recently arrested 
panamanians and speculates that prosecutors intend to use them as 
witnesses against him 
rubino on nov 8 got hoeveler to order cnn to halt broadcasting 
of any tapes that might interfere with attorneyclient privilege 
the network aired a tape for a day but stopped when a federal 
appeals court backed hoeveler 
the supreme court then refused to intervene on a 72 vote 
forcing cnn to submit the tapes to the judge for review 
noriega is in a federal jail outside miami awaiting on charges 
of taking 46 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade

a widely used blood thinner can dramatically 
reduce the risk of a form of stroke triggered by an irregular 
heartbeat says a study released today 
the research in the new england journal of medicine involved the 
drug warfarin and strokes triggered by atrial fibrillation 
abnormally rapid beating of the hearts upper chambers such 
strokes afflict 75000 americans annually 
in march another major study found that aspirin also a 
bloodthinning drug also significantly reduces the likelihood of 
these strokes 
in atrial fibrillation the hearts rapidly beating chambers can 
produce blood clots that can travel to the brain and clog up blood 
vessels causing strokes both aspirin and warfarin interfere with 
the formation of clots 
the study directed by dr j philip kistler at massachusetts 
general hospital was based on 420 patients who were randomly 
assigned to take warfarin or serve in an untreated comparison 
group 
it found that warfarin reduced the risk of stroke by 86 percent 
after two years there were two strokes in the warfarin users and 
13 in the comparison group 
warfarin is routinely used to prevent strokes in people with 
severe atrial fibrillation caused by damaged heart valves however 
doctors have been reluctant to use this medicine in people with 
milder cases because of the chance of serious bleeding 
the new study found that the bleeding risk is slight when the 
drugs use is monitored by doctors 
more research is needed to determine which patients should 
receive warfarin and which should get aspirin the doctors said

brazil and argentina have agreed not to 
produce atomic weapons and will allow inspection of their nuclear 
facilities but the former rivals still refuse to sign a world 
nonproliferation treaty 
wednesdays agreement effectively eliminates the possibility of 
a nuclear arms race in south america officials say the two 
countries are the continents most advanced in nuclear technology 
the agreement was signed wednesday by presidents fernando collor 
de mello of brazil and carlos menem of argentina in the border city 
of foz do iguacu nearly 1200 miles south of brasilia 
we have taken a decisive step to eliminate nuclear rivalry 
between the two countries collor said during the signing 
ceremony 
however the two presidents reiterated their countries decision 
to not sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty because it is 
discriminatory discouraging the transfer of nuclear technology 
to developing countries 
menem said brazil and argentina did not have to offer each other 
additional guarantees regarding the peaceful purposes of their 
nuclear programs 
menem said he would ask argentinas congress to ratify a treaty 
for nuclear nonproliferation in latin america brazil signed and 
ratified the socalled tlatelolco treaty in 1967 
menem said brazil and argentina had banned the production of 
missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads the two countries 
also prohibited nuclear tests inside their territories even for 
peaceful purposes 
brazil and argentina are the only countries in latin america 
that have perfected the complete nuclear fuel cycle 
the international atomic energy agency will start supervising a 
mutual safeguard system within the next 45 days the agencys 
executive secretary hans blix attended the signing of the 
agreement 
the two countries will inspect each others research centers 
military installations and nuclear reactors 
the agreement comes two months after collor personally presided 
over the scrapping of a nuclear test site at a brazilian air force 
base deep in the amazonian jungle the site was never used 
the hole at the serra do cachimbo air force base 930 miles 
northwest of brasilia was excavated in 1979 when brazil was ruled 
by its last military president gen joao figueredo 
civilians took the reins of government in 1985 but full 
democracy was not restored until last decembers election victory 
by collor 
argentinas defense minister said in april that his country had 
halted development of the condor 2 project a mediumrange missile 
that arms control experts said could carry a chemical or nuclear 
warhead 
argentina was ruled by eight years of military dictatorships 
until 1983 when president raul alfonsin was elected menem 
succeeded alfonsin last year 
both countries have nuclear reactors argentina has two brazil 
one

illnesses that could be cured or corrected 
successfully with routine therapy are killing thousands of 
impoverished american blacks because their access to health care is 
limited a new study says 
the study in the november issue of the international journal of 
epidemiology examined the number of americans between the ages of 
15 and 54 who died between 1980 and 1986 from a dozen disorders 
that normally are not lethal if treated early 
during that period there were 121560 premature deaths almost 
80 percent of them among blacks related to the 12 ailments the 
study said only about 13 percent of the total us population is 
black 
correcting the problem and preventing the early deaths dr reed 
v tuckson said wednesday will require a change in national 
attitude 
the nation has to decide whether or not citizen survival is of 
the highest priority said tuckson a senior vice president of 
the march of dimes and a coauthor of the study we have to 
decide as a nation to care 
examined in the study were deaths caused by tuberculosis 
cervical cancer hodgkins disease rheumatic heart disease 
hypertensive heart disease acute respiratory disease pneumonia 
and bronchitis influenza asthma appendicitis hernia and 
cholecystitis 
if detected early and quality treatment is provided nobody 
should be dying of these things said dr eugene schwartz an 
executive in the district of columbia commission of public health 
and a coauthor of the study either they patients are not 
seeking the care or they are being blocked from the care 
the study said that for some of these diseases such as 
appendicitis the occurrence of even a single event should warrant 
further investigation 
yet during the study period 1186 people died of appendicitis 
about 75 percent of them black 
among people aged 15 to 44 the study said the leading cause of 
death was pneumonia and bronchitis conditions that readily yield 
to early therapy blacks died of those conditions almost four times 
more frequently than whites the study said pneumonia and 
bronchitis were treated as one illness in the study 
we dont know all of the reasons why these deaths are 
happening said dr marc rivo president of the district of 
columbia academy of family physicians and a coauthor of the study 
but we know that people are dying of diseases that a family 
physician could treat 
he said that assuring routine periodic medical attention could 
help prevent such premature deaths but added we dont have a 
system that encourages poor people to see a physician on a regular 
basis 
the study said 37 million americans have no access to routine 
health care services and that impoverished blacks mostly in 
cities are more likely to encounter delays or be denied access 
to care 
blacks are four times more likely than whites to rely on 
emergency rooms and hospital clinics for health services the 
study said a similar trend is observed among lowincome 
individuals irrespective of race who must postpone seeking 
primary care until their need for treatment becomes urgent and who 
then turn to hospital emergency rooms 
often rivo said it is too late 
tuckson said regular medical care for the poor including many 
blacks isnt delivered because of such ordinary things as 
transportation problems child care responsibilities or clinics 
that close before most of the working poor are off 
many of the excess deaths he said could also be related to 
behavior the choices that people make 
those choices are often a function of hopelessness a 
disenfranchisement from the community that are related to 
ethnicity and poverty tuckson said wednesday he said there are 
33 million americans without health insurance or other means of 
paying for medical care 
according to the statistics reported wednesday life expectancy 
for black people in the united states fell to 692 years in 1988 
from 694 years in 1987 life expectancy for whites in 1988 was 
756 years unchanged from 1987 
the national center for health statistics said because of the 
decline in the black rate overall life expectancy dropped from 75 
years in 1987 to 749 years in 1988

new prime minister john major has reorganized the 
cabinet he inherited from margaret thatcher a move seen as 
demonstrating his intent not to be a thatcher clone 
major assumed the office on wednesday a day after conservative 
deputies of the house of commons elected him party leader 
major who was mrs thatchers protege and her favorite among 
those seeking the party leadership kept all but three of her 22 
cabinet members but gave many of them different jobs 
he also took on michael heseltine whose challenge of mrs 
thatchers leadership led to her resignation 
by making such extensive changes mr major has demonstrated 
that he is his own man and not as critics have suggested mrs 
thatchers puppet the british broadcasting corp observed today 
the times of london said in an editorial the backseat driver 
if margaret thatcher ever pondered the role has been thrown 
from the car at the first turn 
heseltine was appointed environment secretary with 
responsibility for the promised reform of the widely unpopular 
poll tax that was one of the major factors in bringing down 
mrs thatcher after 11 years as prime minister 
the tax to help fund local government was leveled on a per 
capita basis and many critics saw it as evidence that mrs 
thatchers government was favoring the rich at the expense of the 
lower classes 
with the persian gulf crisis deepening major kept the other 
leadership contender douglas hurd as foreign secretary tom king 
remains as defense secretary 
that indicated a continuation of mrs thatchers prous 
policies including backing the massive us deployment in the gulf 
with thousands of british troops before she resigned mrs 
thatcher promised to double the british contingent to 30000 
soldiers 
one of majors closest associates norman lamont was appointed 
chancellor of the exchequer or treasury chief the post major held 
in mrs thatchers cabinet 
kenneth baker who was conservative party chairman under mrs 
thatcher was appointed by major as home secretary responsible for 
police law and order prisons and a variety of other matters 
the new conservative party chairman is former environment 
secretary christopher patten 
a harris opinion poll broadcast by independent television news 
on wednesday night showed the conservatives under major to be 11 
points ahead of the opposition labor party 
the conservatives had lagged behind in the polls for 16 months 
based on interviews with 1092 people it put support for the 
tories at 49 percent to 38 for labor 9 for the liberal democrats 
and 4 for other groups it stated no margin of error 
a harris poll last spring showed the tories under mrs thatcher 
trailing labor by a whopping 28 points 
by law the next general election must be held by mid1992 but 
the prime minister can call one any time before then 
major at 47 the youngest prime minister of the century had 
displayed both talent and tenacity in overcoming childhood poverty 
and rising rapidly through the government 
the son of a former circus performer major was raised in the 
rundown brixton section of london and left school at 16 he was 
briefly on welfare and worked as a laborer before becoming a 
successful banker 
it was his fortune to be the popular choice of a party torn by 
rebellion against his patron mrs thatcher 
major said wednesday he hoped to build on the achievements of 
his predecessor he said during his campaign that he would stick to 
mrs thatchers policies of tight spending and privatization but 
would review the poll tax 
the government also announced wednesday that it was resuming 
diplomatic relations with syria completing a rapprochement which 
began under mrs thatcher

in life harry weinberg was an abrasive and 
ruthless businessman often accused of letting downtown baltimore go 
to seed in death his 1 billion legacy will go toward improving 
the lives of the poor 
when weinberg died in honolulu earlier this month at age 82 
after an eightyear battle with bone cancer the real estate 
magnate left an estimated 900 million to 1 billion to the harry 
and jeanette weinberg foundation 
overnight the largely anonymous foundation started in 1957 was 
transformed into the nations 12thlargest private foundation one 
to be solely devoted to helping the poor half the money will go 
toward the poor in baltimore 
what did john d macarthur andrew carnegie john d 
rockefeller and now harry weinberg have in common asked honolulu 
businessman john d slocum who tangled with weinberg all were 
geniuses at making money sometimes ruthlessly trampling over 
obstacles even people but when the end came all left fortunes 
for good works 
last year forbes magazine ranked weinberg 70th on its list of 
the 400 richest americans by all accounts his only interest was 
making money 
he was estranged from his only son whom he excluded from his 
will and never bothered with the trappings of the huge wealth he 
accumulated in real estate municipal transit companies and other 
ventures 
weinberg moved to honolulu in 1968 and as in baltimore his 
offices were drab his car was 10 or 15 years old his clothes came 
off the rack and he hated publicity 
in hawaii a state that thrives on consensus he loved to battle 
hawaii business leaders some praised his foresight in recognizing 
the states tourism potential others said he exploited the land 
and ignored the wishes of neighbors nearly all describe his 
personality as abrasive at best 
one of his foes colin cameron president of the maui land and 
pineapple co called weinberg an obnoxious man who did 
nothing with money except make it and regarded his financial 
activities as a game for his own sake 
but after he was diagnosed with the cancer weinberg announced 
he would give all his money away and developed an interest in the 
elderly 
on a humid day in 1989 while visiting several nursing homes in 
israel he wrote a 1 million check on the spot to pay for air 
conditioning in every nursing home in the country 
in baltimore when a patient at levindale hebrew geriatic center 
and hospital complained of never getting ice cream weinberg 
ordered 20000 be spent for ice cream twice a month 
morton weinberg said his father simply loved the city where he 
grew up and wanted to give something back 
weinbergs will indicated he would like half the money 
distributed in baltimore a city of severe drug problems and 
thousands of homeless its dropout teenage pregnancy and infant 
mortality rates are among the nations highest 
as baltimores tax base shrinks from the middleclass exodus to 
the suburbs city leaders and charitable organizations are counting 
on weinbergs largesse to help solve the problems of poverty 
there are so many needs said robert c embry jr president 
of the abell foundation previously the citys largest charity 
foundations are not permitted to lobby but they can put out 
reports on things they can fund demonstration projects programs 
to train people there are a lot of things they can do to help 
under federal law the foundation must disburse at least 5 
percent of its assets every year within two years weinberg 
stipulated that onequarter of the money spent 45 million to 50 
million go to jewish poor another quarter to nonjewish 
religious groups and the rest without regard for affiliation 
the foundations trustees declined to discuss their plans as 
they seek advice from national experts 
the weinberg trustees also must decide what to do with an 
estimated 58 million in real estate under their control in 
downtown baltimore 
for years the properties provoked clashes between weinberg and 
the city and business leaders weinberg left many buildings vacant 
and refused to sell or renovate them which stymied efforts to 
revitalize the area 
gov william donald schaefer who as baltimore mayor railed at 
weinbergs refusal to develop his downtown holdings sees things 
differently now 
i applaud mr weinbergs legacy which hes left to the city 
he said many thousands of disadvantaged people will surely 
benefit from his generosity

the asian development bank today 
granted china a 50 million agricultural loan its first to the 
beijing government since chinese authorities crushed a major 
prodemocracy movement in 1989 
the united states is a principal shareholder in the bank and the 
loan may be linked to us efforts to get china to support a un 
resolution to authorize the use of force in the effort to drive 
iraq from kuwait 
the resolution was expected to come up for a vote in new york 
today 
the bank never publicly acknowledged it was withholding loans to 
china because of the june 1989 crackdown in which hundreds of 
unarmed civilians were killed but bank sources said the united 
states and others were holding back on new loans to pressure 
beijing into reforms 
there was no explanation for the apparent change in the 
unofficial policy toward loans to china and bank spokesmen refused 
comment 
the multinational lending institution today also approved a 
480000 technical assistance grant the loan and grant to the 
agricultural bank of china will be to help beijing modernize and 
expand agricultural facilities in the provinces of jilin shandong 
jiangsu fujian and guandong the bank said 
according to the bank the loan will be for 15 years including a 
three year grace period with an undisclosed interest rate 
the asian development bank organized in 1966 raises funds from 
public and private sources for development projects in asia the 
united states and japan are the principal shareholders followed by 
china india and and more than 25 other member countries 
the united states and other countries shunned china 
diplomatically after the june 1989 crackdown since the persian 
gulf crisis however the united states invited chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen to a meeting in washington with secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
they met again early today 
qian flew to the united states to be present for the un 
security council vote on the ussponsored useofforce 
resolution qian said china would not back the resolution but he 
did not say whether china would abstain 
as a permanent security cuncil member china could veto the 
usbacked resolution 
diplomats suggested he would be seeking concessions 
those might include an end to us opposition to world bank 
loans to china a resumption of defense cooperation and military 
sales and agreement not to link chinas human rights record to its 
mostfavorednation trade status

hawaiis seafoodrich diet may have helped give 
it the nations lowest rate of preventable deaths from nine major 
diseases while michigans industrial lifestyle was blamed in part 
for its having the highest 
the rankings of all 50 states and the district of columbia came 
from a centers for disease control study published wednesday 
it looked at deaths from stroke lung cancer coronary heart 
disease breast cancer diabetes cervical cancer chronic liver 
disease colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease in 1986 the latest year data were available 
the study found that 264 percent of the 2817 deaths in hawaii 
from those nine diseases could have been prevented the lowest 
rate in the nation north dakota and utah both with 332 percent 
tied for the second lowest rate 
michigan had the highest rate 535 percent followed by west 
virginia at 533 percent new york with 526 percent ohio at 521 
percent and kentucky with 52 percent 
the differences depended on several variables but could be 
explained at least partially with a little guesswork said steven 
m teutsch a cdc epidemiologist who worked on the study published 
in the journal of the american medical association 
michigans high rate may be because it is highly industrialized 
and has large minority populations that might know little about 
disease risks he speculated 
in hawaii people tend to eat more seafood and vegetables that 
contributes to lower cholesterol rates and less heart disease he 
said 
researchers arrived at their figures using a model based on 
combining the lowest death rates for each disease to create a 
utopian state with an overall combined death rate for the nine 
diseases of about 224 per 100000 people 
then they compared each state to the ideal 
hawaii came the closest with 3047 deaths per 100000 or 8034 
deaths above the ideal thus 264 percent of its deaths were 
considered preventable 
the study found smoking contributed to the most deaths from the 
nine diseases 33 percent obesity a sedentary lifestyle high 
cholesterol hypertension and diabetes followed 
teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of 
the known risks for each disease such as smoking for lung cancer 
and cholesterol for heart disease dramatically lowers chances of 
developing the illnesses

intelligence agent working on behalf of primeminister yitzhak 
shamir was cleared of charges he arranged a 36 million deal to 
sell usmade military cargo planes to iran 
a federal jury wednesday found ari ben menashe innocent of 
conspiring to circumvent state department regulations on the sale 
of military goods 
a codefendant businessman richard st francis of norwalk 
conn also was acquitted 
they were charged in a scheme to sell three israeliowned 
transports to iran in april 1989 
menashes attorney thomas dunn argued that his client 
represented shamir in a usapproved deal to sell transports to 
iran in 1988 in exchange for the release of four american hostages 
in the middle east 
the deal fell through when shamir insisted three israeli 
soldiers also be freed he said dunn said shamir then sent menashe 
to the united states to broker another deal involving the planes 
the trip ended in menashes arrest 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said menashes claim he was acting 
on behalf of shamir was utter nonsense a fabrication from a to 
z

chancellor helmut kohl appears headed for 
victory in the first free allgerman elections since the 1930s but 
challenger oskar lafontaine hopes to draw enough young voters in 
time to win sundays vote 
lafontaines centerleft social democrats aim to persuade 
germans that kohls conservatives will favor big business and 
neglect workers and the environment as eastern germany makes the 
painful shift to capitalism 
in his final campaign appearance kohl was to be in stuttgart 
and offenburg today lafontaine was to be in saarbruecken 
a new poll by the allensbach institute predicted kohls 
threeparty coalition would receive more than 53 percent of the 
vote in sundays election while the social democrats would get 
about 34 percent 
but a spokesman for the social democrats said the polls did not 
reflect lafontaines true popularity especially among young 
germans who like the quickwitted candidates dynamism and 
persistence 
were not conceding defeat said social democrat spokesman 
eduard heussen we think oskar has a chance 
the leftist lafontaine himself admits that kohl widely regarded 
as the architect of german unity will be a tough man to beat 
unity came and now its a fact that the person in power is 
very fortunate because he can practically dominate the stage 
lafontaine said on monday 
the federal election with 656 seats in a united parliament at 
stake will be the first free united german vote since 1932 just 
before adolf hitler came to power in addition a city council will 
be elected for berlin the capital of united germany 
about 599 million people are eligible to vote 479 million 
from former west germany and 12 million from former east germany 
the two germanys agreed to unite before holding joint elections 
to keep the impoverished eastern loands from sliding into an 
economic abyss 
kohl as west germanys chancellor steered both nations to 
unity and then served as caretaker head of united germany once 
considered a bumbling leader he has grown into one of germanys 
most important figures since the end of world war ii 
the portly kohl 60 usually dressed in a conservative dark 
suit stirs up support with promises of affluence and future german 
greatness his rallies usually close with the crowd singing the 
national anthem 
lafontaine 47 campaigns in a stylish dark shirt and skinny 
tie sometimes accompanied by christa mueller his attractive young 
companion during the past few days peter maffay one of germanys 
most popular rock musicians has performed at his rallies 
earlier this year a deranged woman tried to assassinate 
lafontaine but he recovered from knife wounds suffered in the 
attack 
lafontaine has eschewed optimism for straight talk about 
unifications huge costs maintaining that kohl has misled germans 
about unitys true price tag 
social democrats maintain that kohl is endangering the german 
economy by borrowing heavily to help rebuild former east germany 
the social democrats say they are the true standardbearers of 
german ecology and peace movements and they charge that kohl 
favors big business over helping normal citizens 
eastern germany is beset by high unemployment and mounting 
social ills as it converts to capitalism after more than four 
decades of communist rule

china today denied it is using its un veto 
power in the persian gulf crisis to gain political favors from the 
united states 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said foreign minister 
qian qichens vote today on a un resolution authorizing the use 
of force against iraq has no relation to washingtons invitation to 
qian to make an official visit 
there are no interactions between the two he said 
i dont think theres such a question as to using the power of 
veto as a bargaining method with the united states he said 
qians official visit to washington begins friday the un 
security council was to vote on the useofforce resolution later 
today 
it is the first official visit to the united states by a chinese 
minister since the militarys bloody crackdown in june 1989 on the 
prodemocracy movement in china 
western countries and japan have gradually lifted sanctions 
imposed on china to protest the crackdown western diplomats have 
acknowledged this is due in part to chinas cooperation in the 
international effort to force iraq to quit kuwait 
the asian development bank today granted china a 50 million 
agricultural loan its first to the beijing government since the 
crackdown 
bank officials denied comment but the united states is a 
principal shareholder and the loan may be linked to us efforts to 
get china to support the un useofforce resolution 
japan sent its education minister to beijing in september and 
resumed lowinterest loans to china the european community voted 
in october to lift all sanctions except the ban on arms sales and 
defense cooperation 
inviting qian for talks appeared to be one more effort to smooth 
relations with china in return for its support on gulf resolutions 
qian met early today in new york with secretary of state james 
a baker iii the official xinhua news agency said they discussed 
the upcoming security council meeting on the persian gulf crisis 
but it gave no other details 
as one of the five permanent members of the un security 
council china has veto power over resolutions so far china has 
supported all 10 resolutions aimed at forcing iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait 
but qian said wednesday before leaving beijing that china would 
not support the resolution to permit force against iraq he refused 
to say whether china would veto it or abstain 
li the foreign ministry spokesman also refused to say what 
china would do as to what vote will china cast its not time 
for voting yet 
china has stressed that all efforts to reach a peaceful solution 
to the gulf crisis must be exhausted before considering the use of 
force 
western diplomats said china apparently hoped to persuade 
washington to lift remaining sanctions against beijing in return 
for allowing the resolution on force to pass 
qians visit to washington is itself a concession by the bush 
administration after chinas crackdown on protesters last year 
the united states had refused to invite highlevel chinese 
officials 
at the beijing airport qian said he expected to meet with 
president bush something that would be a significant diplomatic 
victory for china 
qian also might seek an end to us opposition to world bank 
loans to china that do not address humanitarian needs a resumption 
of defense cooperation and military sales and agreement not to 
link chinas human rights record to its mostfavorednation trade 
status 
asked if human rights issues would come up during qians talks 
with us officials li said i dont think that it is 
appropriate for some individuals to make some random remarks about 
internal affairs of other countries with the excuse of human 
rights 
and it is not appropriate either to interfere in some 
developing countries internal affairs with an excuse of human 
rights he said

an elderly man who killed himself was 
upset that the life savings he spent on worthless junk bonds from 
lincoln savings and loan never would benefit abused children he 
wanted to help a friend said 
although some elderly people who had invested in the bonds were 
left in desperate straits the death of anthony elliot 89 was the 
first suicide blamed on the scandal burbank police sgt don 
goldberg said wednesday 
marion lovelace a los angeles real estate agent said his 
friend was despondent that the 160000 he had bequeathed to a 
national child abuse group was lost when lincoln collapsed 
that was his greatest job knowing he was doing something for 
those children lovelace said when he lost his money it took 
all his joy away he lost his reason to live 
since 1980 elliott had been a benefactor to woodland 
hillsbased childhelp usa a national nonprofit group formed to 
prevent child abuse and help victims 
elliot a retired accountant was found monday in a bathtub by 
his parttime housekeeper his wrists and forearms had been slashed 
by a razor police said 
there is no doubt in my mind that he committed suicide over 
the loss of his savings goldberg said he said elliott had 
talked with neighbors and his housekeeper who say he had become 
bitter and cynical about the sampl scandal it appears that the 
loss of 200000 pretty well represented his life savings this is 
a very tragic very sad very pathetic death he said 
in a note found by authorities elliott blamed federal 
regulators for the loss of his savings 
theres nothing left for me of things that used to be 
elliot said in the note government is supposed to serve and 
protect but who those who can gather the most savings from 
retired people it takes billions to fill the pockets of 
spendocrats 
elliot was a plaintiff in a nationwide classaction suit 
pending against thrift owner charles h keating jr and other 
lincoln executives alleging fraud burlingame attorney joseph 
cotchett said 
keating and the others are charged with misleading investors 
about the safety of junk bonds issued by lincolns parent company 
american continental corp of phoenix prosecutors allege nearly 
18000 investors many of them elderly lost about 250 million 
experts say lincolns failure will cost taxpayers 2 billion 
the money will go to pay off depositors 
the senate ethics committee is currently holding hearings to try 
to determine whether the socalled keating five sens dennis 
deconcini dariz alan cranston dcalif john mccain rariz 
john glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich improperly 
intervened for keating because of the 13 million he and 
associates contributed to their campaigns and favorite causes

women who take estrogen after menopause run a 
slightly higher risk of breast cancer a 10year study concluded 
but researchers said women should not automatically abandon the 
hormone supplements 
an estimated 20 million prescriptions for estrogen are written 
each year for postmenopausal women to relieve the symptoms of 
menopause fight the debilitating bone disease osteoporosis and 
battle heart disease 
the study of more than 118000 woman nurses over a 10year 
period indicated that women who take estrogen are 35 percent to 40 
percent more likely to develop breast cancer than those who didnt 
take the hormone 
only a small fraction of the women in the study developed breast 
cancer so the increase in risk was considered small 
the added risk is only about half what a woman might face if her 
mother had breast cancer said epidemiologist dr graham colditz of 
bostons brigham and womens hospital lead author of the study in 
wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
once women stop taking estrogen the risk is eliminated he 
said 
i would not recommend that a woman change her current use of 
estrogen therapy based on these data alone said coauthor dr 
meir stampfer of the harvard school of public health in boston 
women who are at high risk for breast cancer and no risk for 
heart disease might choose to avoid estrogen use while women who 
run a high risk of heart disease and little risk of breast cancer 
might still use it colditz said 
the article analyzed data collected from 1976 to 1986 in all 
722 incidents of breast cancer were identified among the women 
breast cancer strikes one in 10 american women and 44000 
american women will die this year from the disease according to 
the american cancer society

the parents of a cancer patient who died 
shortly after undergoing a courtordered caesarean section have 
reached a settlement that the american civil liberties union calls 
an important victory for womens rights 
the settlement reached monday between george washington 
university hospital and the family of angela carder includes a 
monetary award and an agreement by the hospital to establish 
policies protecting pregnant womens rights to determine their 
medical treatment 
both parties agreed not to disclose the size of the award 
we did not want the dollar amount to overshadow what we think 
is the more significant outcome of the case which is the policy 
perspective said terry thorton an attorney working with the 
aclu who represented the family 
carder 27 a terminal cancer patient at the hospital died in 
1987 two days after doctors performed a caesarean section ordered 
by a lower court in an attempt to save the life of her 26weekold 
fetus 
the baby died less than three hours after the operation which 
was listed as a contributing factor in carders death 
carders parents who live in clarksville md appealed the 
order saying that their daughter who was conscious and coherent 
at the time of the operation did not give informed consent 
further the family charged that the surgery violated carders 
right to bodily integrity 
the district of columbia court of appeals ruled in the familys 
favor last april saying a fetus cannot have rights superior 
to those of a person who has already been born 
on behalf of the stoners the aclu brought a civil suit and a 
medical malpractice case against the hospital charging that the 
hospital had not taken sufficient measures to determine carders 
wishes and did not consult the family before requesting the court 
order 
in accordance with the settlement the hospital has agreed to 
establish policies aimed at precluding court intervention in such 
cases 
we have learned a great deal from the angela carder case 
said christine st andre of the hospital when angela carder was 
a patient at gw we had not yet developed policies which addressed 
critical questions concerning maternal and fetal rights 
st andre said the hospital has established an ethics committee 
to address such issues and will provide a list of referrals 
specializing in reproductive rights for legal assistance patients 
will be informed of their rights prior to treatment and advocates 
will be made available to patients should conflicts arise 
the hospital and the aclu agree that the most significant part 
of the settlement is that it confirms that the court is an 
inappropriate place to resolve such conflicts

the nations infant death rate among blacks 
remains stuck at unacceptably high levels that prevailed 20 years 
ago says the march of dimes birth defects foundation 
the group warned wednesday the infant death rate for whites and 
blacks has shown little improvement at the current pace the 
country will fall short of its goal of reducing the rate to seven 
in 1000 births by the year 2000 said dr reed tuckson the 
foundations senior vice president for programs 
the comments came after the government announced the infant 
death rate in 1988 was 10 per 1000 births a 1 percent drop from 
the previous year there were 38910 deaths of infants under 1 year 
of age in 1988 
tuckson said president bush should go ahead with recommendations 
from an unreleased white house report urging expansion of medicaid 
and more money for community health centers 
the white house task force report also recommends stepped up 
federal efforts to reduce smoking drinking and drug abuse during 
pregnancy tuckson said 
babies are dying while a prescription for helping them sits on 
a shelf said tuckson 
there is a sharp difference between the infant death rate for 
whites and blacks 
the rate for white infants was 85 per 1000 births in 1988 
while for black infants it was 176 
tuckson said the black infant death rate today is nearly equal 
to the white infant death rate in 1970 the death rate for black 
infants historically has been more than twice the rate for whites 
the government also reported on other mortality data for 1988 
it said the national death rate from aids rose 20 percent in 1988 
making it the 15thleading cause of death in the country 
the death rate for homicide also went up in 1988 while the 
decline of recent years in mortality from heart disease and stroke 
contnued reported the national center for health statistics 
which is part of the centers for disease control 
there was a slight decline in the rate of death from cancer 
education and prevention efforts which helped combat chronic 
disease can also be effective in helping us deal with these new 
threats of aids and homicide said cdc director william roper 
there were 16602 deaths due to aids in 1988 66 deaths per 
100000 population said the cdcs national center for health 
statistics aids was the 15thleading cause of death in both 1987 
and 1988 
the death rate from homicide rose 47 percent in 1988 to nine 
per 100000 people it was the 12thleading cause of death

french officials said today that a rebel offensive 
in chad is gaining strength and the government ordered 150 foreign 
legionnaires to reinforce french troops in chad but said they would 
not join the fighting 
chads government contends the rebels are backed by libya a 
view shared by the us state department libya denies the claim 
and france has described the 3weekold war as an internal conflict 
between chadians 
a french foreign ministry spokesman said today the situation 
is worsening and the battles are more severe 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said the rebel offensive 
has grown in size and government forces are encountering 
difficulties on the ground 
other french sources said rebel leader idriss debys forces were 
moving western away from the border with sudan and toward the 
capital ndjamena 
the french defense ministry said a 150strong company of the 
second foreign parachutist regiment would be sent to ndjamena 
the move was aimed at bettering the security of our troops and 
assuring if need be the protection of our nationals there are 
an estimated 1250 french civilians in chad a former french 
colony 
france already had 1000 troops in chad and recently redeployed 
a company from ndjamena to the northeastern town of abeche near 
the main combat zone 
france has said that president hissene habres troops suffered 
considerable losses in the recent fighting the two sides have 
claimed to take and retake several eastern towns but neither has

an expedition has discovered remains of a 
gigantic whale dinosaur and a brontosaurus that lived more 
recently than other known dinosaurs of its type scientists 
announced 
university of colorado paleontologist robert bakker said 
wednesday that the two finds in the fertile dinosaur fields of 
southern wyoming are providing important clues about dinosaur 
extinction 
bakker said the remains of a 70footlong haplocanthosaurus a 
member of the cetiosaur or whale dinosaur family were found in 
the como bluffs area near mcfadden wyo last july 
the team also is excavating a brontosaurus that is the only one 
of its kind known to have survived the cretaceous period that began 
about 135 million years ago the excavation is under way near rock 
river wyo in a fossil deposit known as the breakfast bench rock 
river is just a few miles north of como bluff 
bakker said that before this discovery no brontosaurus had ever 
been unearthed that was less than about 137 million years old 
this means the golden book of dinosaurs will need a slight 
footnote since this particular animal apparently managed to slide 
just under the tag into the cretaceous he said 
the brontosaurus bones were found last may by don kralis a high 
school science teacher from leadville who has been assisting bakker 
with his wyoming fieldwork 
finding this brontosaurus was a big surprise bakker said 
our initial reaction was that the animal was stuck in the wrong 
time zone 
the whale dinosaur or cetiosaur dubbed the carlin giant 
was found by james filla an expedition volunteer and physicist at 
the national institute of science and technology in boulder the 
find included a shoulder thigh tailbone hand forearm shin and 
several vertebrae from both the carlin giant and another small 
specimen 
the carlin giant is the largest member of cetiosaur family ever 
unearthed bakker said 
its not surprising that this particular animal was so big 
because it appears to be the last in its line bakker said as 
a rule the large dinosaurs tended to get larger before they went 
extinct and we seem to have caught the last gasp of the 
cetiosaur 
cetiosaurs large planteaters that were common during the late 
jurassic period about 150 million years ago apparently were the 
victim of a worldwide catastrophe that struck about that time said 
bakker 
one after another the giant dinosaur families died out and 
the cetiosaurs were the first to go bakker said as far as we 
know this was the first major extinction of a large dinosaur 
family during the late jurassic 
he said his paleontology teams work at como bluff has 
determined the cetiosaurs were the first dinosaur family to die off 
in a onebyone stepwise extinction sequence it spanned a 
period beginning 150 million years ago and ending 66 million years 
ago 
stepwise patterns just dont agree with the popular theory 
that a cataclysmic disaster suddenly wiped out the dinosaurs 
bakker said the fossil record clearly indicates that these mass 
extinctions were not the result of one saturday night of cosmic 
mayhem

germany will send the soviet union huge food 
reserves that were stockpiled to help feed west berlin in case of a 
repeat of the 194849 soviet blockade of the city a top government 
official said today 
the announcement regarding the socalled berlin reserves was the 
latest in a series of german actions aimed at helping the soviets 
it was made by horst teltschik chief foreign policy adviser to 
chancellor helmut kohl 
also today the german red cross sent 37 tons of emergency food 
supplies on an aeroflot plane to the soviet union starting what 
officials hope could be a daily airlift to the soviet union 
a telethon on germanys zdf television wednesday night netted 
pledges of 38 million marks 26 million to help soviets 
burdened by the onset of winter and empty shelves in state stores 
other campaigns are collecting millions of dollars more worth of 
donations and goods if the pace keeps up the relief effort could 
become the largest such humanitarian action germany has launched 
teltschik who just returned from talks in moscow told 
reporters that kohl had agreed to send the berlin reserves to the 
soviets he said details would be worked out next week 
the massive stockpiles of grain canned fruit and other foods 
and supplies are valued at up to 16 billion 
officials in west berlin had built up the reserves in case of a 
repeat of the blockade that cut off all but air travel to and from 
the western side of the divided city a usled airlift broke the 
blockade in 1949 
berlin officials urged that the supplies be sent to the soviets 
as sign of good will in the current era of improved relations 
between east and west 
in bonn the german branch of the care international relief 
organization said today it would soon be sending the first batch of 
20000 food packages to the soviet union 
the packages contain such items as chocolate rice and meat 
care packages sent by americans were vital in feeding germans after 
world war ii and the memory of the welcome aid has become part of 
national history 
germany has been leading international efforts to aid the 
soviets kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher both have 
appealed for private donations for the action 
please help relieve the need in the soviet union this is a 
work of charity and of good neighborliness kohl said in an 
appeal broadcast wednesday night on zdf television 
kohl also called to mind the soviets role in clearing the way 
for german unification less than two months ago 
we all have to thank the soviet union in these months kohl 
said i am certain that we all are ready to help 
genscher has said widespread hunger in the soviet union could 
lead to instability that in turn could threaten the rest of europe 
teltschik was in moscow this week discussing ways to get the 
german donations into the soviet union and to keep the goods out of 
the hands of blackmarketeers 
teltschik said president mikhail s gorbachev promised to 
expedite customs and visas for the aid program and germans could 
accompany the aid deliveries 
on friday large trucks and buses also filled with supplies 
are scheduled to head to the soviet union along with 16 red cross 
workers botho zu saynwittgenstein head of the german red cross 
said in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio 
he said the food would start to reach the most needy people 
those in retirement homes and homes for the handicapped by the 
weekend 
red cross officials said an enormous relief action is planned 
although they could not give precise figures until they know amount 
of private donations and government support 
many republics and regions of the soviet union have halted 
shipments of fod and consumer goods to other areas as central 
control over the economy erodes 
rather than obey kremlin demands for deliveries of food to the 
cities at state prices they consider too low they are trading 
directly with factories and regions bartering for other scarce 
supplies 
economic reforms have also freed farmers to sell more of their 
produce at market prices leaving less for delivery at stateset 
prices to the state stores employee theft is rampant 
the soviet union had a record grain crop this year but millions 
of tons of wheat rotted in fields for lack of equipment fuel and 
transport

a summit of black leaders called 
by archbishop desmond tutu to seek peace in south africa began 
today with the noteable absence of zulu leader chief mangosuthu 
buthelezi 
buthelezi and two black homeland leaders turned down the 
invitation from the anglican archbishop to take part in the meeting 
to discuss efforts to end apartheid and replace it with a 
democratic state 
the summit will talk about problems confronting south african 
blacks including black factional fighting that has claimed 
thousands of lives in recent years most of the fighting has been 
between members of buthelezis conservative inkatha movement and 
african national congress supporters 
in calling in october for the summit tutu said those who did 
not attend would reveal themselves as enemies of peace and unity 
had buthelezi turned up it would have been the first meeting 
between him and the ancs deputy president nelson mandela the 
meeting in part had been called to bring the two facetoface to 
discuss the violence 
the leaders of the bophuthatswana and ciskei homelands also 
declined to attend 
those who have turned down the invitation need to examine 
their motives tutu said today shortly before the delegates sat 
down to talk at his official residence at bishopscourt 
tutu pointedly avoided a specific reference to buthelezi in his 
rebuke 
we would have wanted the meeting to be a great deal more 
inclusive than it is turning out to be he said the point is 
that when you want peace you talk to anybody 
he said he hoped the meeting would be the beginning of a process 
that would make a difference in south africa he said he was 
particularly concerned about the intolerance among rival black 
groups that led to violence carnage and mayhem 
in a way we are looking for a miracle we dont believe that 
the age of miracles has ended he said 
there was no immediate comment from mandela on buthelezis 
absence 
president fw de klerk has promised to end white minority rule 
and share power with the black majority the government and the anc 
are expected to start talks next year on a new constitution 
the 10 black homelands were set up by the government under the 
apartheid system of racial segregation four of them

aids among women is likely to increase 
dramatically over the next 10 years with three out of four aids 
virus infections resulting from heterosexual contact the world 
health organization said today 
it estimated that of the 9 to 11 million adults and children now 
carrying the hiv virus 3 million are women most of them live in 
the third world 
the new projections were released in advance of world aids day 
dec 1 
who said the share of global hiv infections resulting from sex 
between men and women will rise from 60 percent now to 75 percent 
to 80 percent by 2000 
this will mean dramatic increases in hiv infection among 
women who said it forecast that by the end of the decade the 
number of carriers would rise to between 25 and 30 million 
worldwide including 10 million children born to infected mothers 
scientists say women who have sex with aidsinfected men are 
much more likely to catch the virus than are men who have sex with 
infected women a recent finding suggested women were 14 times more 
likely than men to catch the virus that way 
we certainly can say that the aids pandemic will continue into 
future generations dr michael h merson head of the whos global 
program on aids told reporters 
the agencys monthly aids statistics also made public today 
listed 156 countries reporting a total of 307379 cases an 
increase of more than 8000 over october 
updated figures from the united states burundi rwanda zambia 
brazil italy and spain were mainly responsible for the increase 
because of widespread underreporting who estimates the real 
cumulative total of cases at 13 million one third of them women 
merson said the projected increase in heterosexual virus 
transmission was especially marked in developing countries they 
are expected to account for 80 to 90 percent of all infections by 
2000 compared with about 65 percent now 
in subsaharan africa one out of 40 women is infected against 
one in 500 women in latin america and one in 700 women in north 
america who said 
in some cities in subsaharan africa up to 40 percent of men 
and women may be infected with hiv it said these infections 
will cause a doubling or tripling of the total adult mortality rate 
during the 1990s 
in the developed world less than 10 percent of the infections 
result from heterosexual contacts but that share is slowly 
increasing merson said 
merson said some scientists expect that some vaccines 
may be ready for testing within two to three years but he made 
plain that he doubted that there will be an early breakthrough 
we will be lucky if we have a vaccine by the end of this 
decade he said in response to a question

people in the northeast used to bundling up this time of year 
got one last change to hit the streets in shirt sleeves but things 
began returning to normal this morning as temperatures fell 
boston hit 74 degrees wednesday breaking the record of 68 for 
the date set in 1896 it was the highest temperature ever recorded 
in boston so late in the year 
new york city peaked at 69 degrees at midnight tying a 
95yearold record for nov 28 the normal high for the date is 48 
degrees the temperature held at 69 at 1 am today two degrees 
warmer than the record for nov 29 set in 1968 according to the 
national weather service 
but by 10 am today the mercury dipped to 50 degrees in new 
york and to 56 degrees in boston 
the heat wednesday forced the firstever postponement of a 
boston celtics basketball game at boston garden when condensation 
from the ice hockey rink under the court made the floor too slick 
to play on safely 
windsurfing and other warmweather pursuits took center stage 
on a day like today people dont waste time in the shop 
said manager ed silvia at madd mikes windsurfing warehouse in 
boston if theres a good wind people will just shoot right out 
unless theres a few stragglers who need equipment 
ice skaters at rockefeller center in new york glided as usual 
around the rink beneath the complexs giant christmas tree except 
that most skaters abandoned their coats 
temperatures were expected to drop back down to the 40s over the 
weekend and forecasters predicted a colder than normal winter for 
most of the east 
thus in spite of our record 74degree temperature in boston 
today you may want to keep that snow shovel handy the weather

the new us ambassador to lebanon ryan 
crocker presented his credentials to president elias hrawi today 
after reopening the us embassy which was evacuated 15 months ago 
during fierce fighting 
the decision to send in crocker despite the still tenuous 
security situation reflects us support for hrawis government 
which is trying to create a militiafree capital and end 15 years 
of civil war 
i have presented to his excellency president hrawi my 
letters of credence accrediting me as ambassador of the united 
states to lebanon crocker told reporters after the 30minute 
ceremony 
the ceremony attended by the us embassys first secretary 
patrick mccurary as well as prime minister salim hoss was held at 
hrawis temporary residence in the seaside ramlet albaida district 
of moslem west beirut 
crocker dressed in a gray suit arrived at the presidents 
residence after a onehour meeting with hoss at the government 
house in which he presented a copy of his credentials 
greenbereted soldiers of the lebanese armys elite commando 
brigade provided security for crocker surrounding his car with 
seven jeeps that sped across the jammed streets of west beirut with 
lights on and horns honking 
the ceremony occurred one day after crocker was flown by 
helicopter from cyprus to the us embassy compound in beiruts 
northern suburb of aukar 
crocker 51 a career diplomat who joined the state department 
in 1971 became the first american diplomat to enter the us 
embassy compound since it was evacuated by former ambassador john 
mccarthy and his staff sept 6 1989 
followers of rebel gen michel aoun had besieged the compound 
the christian general who battled syrian troops backing the 
government was defeated in october militias have since been 
withdrawing from the capital 
crocker was based in lebanon as a political officer at the 
embassy in the early 1980s he also held diplomatic posts in iran 
qatar and iraq 
in washington deputy state department spokesman richard boucher 
said on wednesday that crocker was dispatched to beirut after a 
us security team inspected the situation in the lebanese capital 
last weekend 
a lebanese foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said crocker and seven american security officials 
arrived at the embassy compound wednesday morning aboard two us 
helicopters 
he said a third helicopter also landed supplies at the 
heavilyguarded embassy compound 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the united states had discussed its decision to send in 
crocker with syria which backs hrawi with 40000 troops deployed 
in most of lebanon

fighters from areas they controlled within greater beirut in 
line with government plans to create a militiafree capital 
samir geageas lebanese forces rightwing christian militia has 
withdrawn about 140 tons of ammunition from areas it controlled in 
east beirut and said it would withdraw fighters later to the 
christian heartland north of the greater beirut boundaries

the zebra mussel a fastbreeding type of 
shellfish that clogs the intake pipes of power plants has been 
found in the hudson river for the first time scientists said 
the mussels which had not been seen east of the central section 
of the erie canal were found off croton point in westchester 
county new york citys northern suburbs it was identified 
wednesday by experts at the new york zebra mussel information 
clearinghouse at the state university of new york at brockport 
it is the first confirmed north american sighting of the 
mussel outside of the great lakes drainage basin charles oneill 
jr a supervisor at the clearinghouse told the new york times in 
a story published today 
oneill noted that the zebra mussel classified as a freshwater 
animal is not usually found in saltwater like the lower hudson 
it raises a lot of questions that we dont have answers for 
he said 
the zebra mussel a native of europe was first found in the 
united states in 1988 in lake st clair east of detroit 
named for its dark brown stripes on a tan shell the mussel 
breeds quickly and can clog the intake pipes of power plants and 
eats microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for 
freshwater fish 
in areas where the mussels have taken hold utilities have 
fought back by flushing pipes with treated water cleaning intake 
screens by hand and using chlorine and other chemicals to kill 
them 
the us fish and wildlife service has estimated that the 
expanding population of the mussels could add 500 million a year 
in added costs for utilities water companies and factories and 
loss of business in sports fishing marinas and motels along inland 
waterways

president bushs quest to aid the poor by 
substituting selfhelp programs for government handouts is sparking 
friction among white house aides administration officials and 
conservative members of congress 
it even prompted a call by rep newt gingrich rga for budget 
director richard darman either to recant a recent speech or resign 
a group of conservative policy makers inside the white house 
with strong backing from hud secretary jack kemp is pressing to 
make empowering initiatives in housing education and welfare 
the centerpiece of bushs next state of the union address 
the general philosophy say those backing the concept is to 
give people tools to help themselves rather than having government 
social programs do it for them 
for example housing legislation signed by bush on wednesday 
aims to help poor people buy public housing apartments or vacant 
homes 
a cornerstone of our effort to reduce the heavy hand of 
government is this idea of empowering people not bureaucracies 
the president said in signing the measure 
the debate was sparked partly by a speech last april by james p 
pinkerton bushs deputy assistant for policy planning in which he 
said the idea is to enact policies that empower people to make 
choices for themselves 
but the concept drew a public rebuke earlier this month from 
darman who ridiculed the slogan of the new paradigm as 
pretentious and meaningless 
darman dismissed the idea of boosting the use of vouchers and 
decentralized policymaking as a throwback to old initiatives that 
did not work in the 1960s 
we now find ourselves encouraged to embrace several 
programmatic ideas that are returning from a quartercentury 
hiatus but which have not yet been seriously tested or 
evaluated darman said in a nov 16 speech to the council for 
excellence in government a private watchdog group the ideas are 
little more than slogans he said 
darmans words infuriated conservatives gingrich denounced the 
darman speech as an assault on members of his own party and 
demanded wednesday night that darman either recant or resign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said darman and gingrich 
had smoothed over their differences in a telephone conversation 
today and that darman was not withdrawing the speech 
director darman and newt had a long conversation this morning 
and they re great and good friends and theres no problem said 
fitzwater 
asked if bush stood by his budget director fitzwater said 
sure 
in an era when communist regimes around the world are 
collapsing bush is warming to the theme of putting power back in 
the hands of people and out of the grip of centralized 
bureaucracies 
the national affordable housing act including 25 billion this 
year and 27 billion in fiscal 1992 provides grants for 
lowincome families to buy their public housing units or homes that 
are vacant or have been foreclosed 
the measure provides 155 million for such projects this year 
and 885 million for 1992 it also authorizes 123 million this 
fiscal year and 258 million for 1992 to provide housing and 
services for the homeless 
and it contains a new block grant program authorizing 1 
billion for this year and 21 billion for 1992 to promote 
partnerships by federal state and local governments with private 
groups and industry to meet housing needs the white house said 
earlier wednesday kemp briefed members of the domestic policy 
council on possible initiatives under consideration for the state 
of the union address and fiscal 1992 budget bush named kemp on 
aug 6 to head a task force on empowerment 
the ideas that kemp and the white house conservatives are 
touting including vouchers to give parents wider choice in 
education innercity enterprise zones and tenant ownership of 
public housing are hardly new in fact former president reagan 
went to bat for most of them to no avail 
but their advocates are banking on rising public dissatisfaction 
with government to give new life to these old ideas 
the new paradigm enables the gop to move forward in these 
areas and do good without going back to the great society of noble 
rhetoric and unintended consequences pinkerton said in april 
for republicans he said fighting taxes and communists has 
brought us about as far as it can the future growth of the 
republican party depends on our ability to address voters concerns 
about other important issues such as health child care education 
and pollution

a former navy secretary today called president 
bushs 430000troop buildup in the persian gulf a mistake and said 
attacking iraq would compound it but the white house insisted 
saddam hussein must know that he could face military action at 
any time 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also said bush remains 
reluctant to call congress back to discuss the gulf crisis despite 
recent calls for a special session 
lets wait and see fitzwater said suggesting bush would 
consult with members of congress he has invited to the white house 
on friday about the possibility of a special session 
james webb a former navy secretary in the reagan 
administration told the senate armed service committee today that 
the presidents mistake in sending so many troops should not be 
compounded by a further error in using them in a premature 
unprovoked ground offensive 
webb is the third former top military official to urge caution 
in the gulf two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff said 
wednesday bush should give sanctions against iraq more time to work 
before opting for war 
but fitzwater shrugged off the comments as well as house 
majority leader richard gephardts announced opposition to any 
early use of force 
we simply disagree with the congressman about that 
fitzwater said 
the white house spokesman said the additional troop buildup was 
vital to maintain an offensive capability should it be needed 
and fitzwater said the resolution to be voted on later today by 
the un security council to authorize force against iraq is also 
essential 
the fact is we want this resolution as a way of keeping 
pressure on saddam keeping him aware of the fact that he could 
face military action at any time he said

meanwhile vice president dan quayle argued against waiting too 
long before using military force against iraq 
does patience today risk greater american casualties 
tomorrow quayle asked in remarks prepared for a speech to seton 
hall university in south orange nj 
even as we exercise patience and restraint we must also be 
alert to the moral costs of such a course quayle said he said 
that with every day that passes the plight of the people of 
kuwait grows more desperate 
furthermore quayle said will continued patience with iraq 
help make the world vulnerable to nuclear blackmail by saddam 
hussein and if so is this a moral course of action

fitzwater said bush has made no decisions yet about a special 
session of congress which either bush or congressional leaders 
could initiate 
theres been no decision here to hold a special session the 
president obviously will discuss this in his friday meeting 
well continue to consult with members of congress about it some 
feel it would be beneficial others feel it wouldnt 
asked if bush were reluctant to call such a session fitzwater 
replied reluctant is a good word 
in his congressional testimony webb said the president should 
call for an immediate resumption of the draft and then a 
declaration of war by the congress 
richard perle who also served in the reagan administration as 
an assistant secretary of defense said an american defeat in the 
gulf would do serious damage to the nation 
it would gravely diminish the strength and authority with 
which the united states emerged from a half century of opposition 
to the idea that military power whether it be hitlers or stalins 
or saddam husseins can be allowed to determine the fate of 
nations perle said 
on wednesday two former us military chiefs bolstered 
democratic demands for a goslow approach in the gulf 
the question is how much pain we administer and how quickly 
and whether we do it with the embargo or the use of force said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader said 
wednesday evening the chances were better than 5050 for a 
special session on the gulf crisis probably before christmas 
the senate hearings were prompted by bushs decision to send 
200000 additional troops to the persian gulf region to supplement 
230000 sent there after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
i think the force is much too large to be able to be sustained 
politically and perhaps even logistically nunn said at the 
conclusion of the days hearing 
i counsel patience war is not neat its not tidy its a 
mess said retired adm william crowe who was chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff under reagan 
retired air force gen david c jones chairman of the joint 
chiefs under carter voiced concern with the latest troop 
deployment 
jones said his fear isnt that we might choose to fight but 
rather that the deployment might cause us to fight perhaps 
prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily 
crowe and jones recommended that the united states give the 
sanctions a year to 18 months to take effect before resorting to 
military force

iraqi officials have promised to free at 
least 14 american hostages in response to a plea from former world 
heavyweight boxing champion muhammad ali his spokesman said 
a leftwing british lawmaker meanwhile left baghdad today 
saying 15 britons would be released in response to a request he 
made in a meeting with iraqi president saddam hussein 
and in finland there were reports that a finnish delegation had 
secured the release of five of the eight finns being held 
three canadian lawmakers negotiated the release five of the 45 
canadians trapped in iraq and kuwait the lawmakers said that 
unlike other nations that sent medicines and made overtures to iraq 
in exchange for captives they had made no deals with saddam 
they implied their stance had reduced the number of canadians 
freed 
ali who is suffering from parkinsons disease and who traveled 
to baghdad at the invitation of iraq met with saddam on tuesday 
for 50 minutes ali used hand signals to communicate with jaber 
mohammed who speaks for him 
saddam used the meeting which was shown on iraqi television to 
repeat that the hostages which he calls guests are being well 
treated 
alis spokesman jaber mohammed said the 48yearold former 
champion and his entourage expect to leave baghdad on saturday and 
hope to receive a list of the hostages to be freed today he said 
iraq promised ali at least 14 hostages 
the government has prevented hundreds of westerners from leaving 
since its aug 2 invasion of kuwait but it has allowed some 
captives to leave with visiting politicians prominent public 
figures and peace groups 
the bush administration has condemned the sporadic releases as 
aimed at dividing the world alliance against iraq 
almost 1000 americans remain in iraq and kuwait more than 100 
held as human shields at strategic military and industrial 
sites in iraq hundreds from other nations are also being held in 
iraq and the occupied emirate 
british lawmaker tony benn who met with the iraqi president on 
wednesday said he was told the british hostages would be freed 
soon but no specific timetable was given the parliament member 
from britains opposition labor party traveled to baghdad on 
sunday in search of possibilities of a peaceful settlement to 
the gulf crisis he said 
canadian lawmakers said they had made no deals with saddam 
we have made no concessions signed no declarations have not 
been involved in bargaining or bartering said canadian lawmaker 
robert corbett we made it clear we had nothing to offer 
the delegation arrived in amman today with two of the five 
canadians released by iraq hassanain abdul aziz 18 from 
toronto and lee binns 38 of calgary the other three were 
expected to leave shortly 
we came to iraq hoping to return home with 47 canadians 
lawmaker svend robinson told reporters at amman airport but some 
delegations came back after having paid a fairly heavy price there 
is no question about that 
they were prepared to take a step that we simply as a 
delegation were not prepared to take robinson said 
sixtyeight italians arrived in rome from iraq late wednesday 
the syrianborn archbishop who secured their freedom hilarion 
capucci said he would return to iraq for more 
the italian government also sent a plane load of medicine to 
iraq 
french german and swedish hostages were freed after the 
governments of those countries called for a peaceful solution to 
the gulf crisis france and sweden also indicated there could be 
some linkage between iraqs solution of the gulf crisis and the 
palestinian question after iraq pulls out of kuwait 
a foreign ministry official said in stockholm sweden that 
iraqi authorities started issuing exit visas to all swedish 
hostages today and they were expected to be allowed to leave 
friday 
in copenhagen denmark meanwhile the jyllandsposten newspaper 
said that a group of danes stranded in iraq and kuwait are looking

a cabinet minister and close ally of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir today rejected us demands for israeli 
flexibility in stalled middle east peace efforts and blamed the 
americans for the impasse 
justice minister dan meridor also said israel would ask 
washington for serious amounts of money to help finance the 
thousands of jews emigrating from the soviet union 
meanwhile avi pazner a top shamir aid said israel expected 
the united states to block a un security council resolution to 
send an ombudsman to the west bank and gaza strip to investigate 
human rights violations by israel 
such a resolution is to be debated by the council on friday 
we dont think this will get a majority but if necessary we 
hope the americans are going to veto it pazner said 
meridor was responding to reports that president bush expected 
creative ideas from shamir concerning the peace process when 
the two leaders meet dec 11 in washington 
meridor said the americans had doomed proposed 
palestinianisraeli peace talks from the outset by insisting that 
the plo be given a role israel opposes any involvement by the plo 
which israeli officials consider a terror group 
meridor said he hoped the americans had distanced themselves 
from this mistake since the plo has supported iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
i hope that now there is greater creativity on the american 
side that they understand the realities of the middle east and the 
aspirations of the plo meridor said on israel army radio 
in april 1989 shamir proposed a peace initiative calling for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to choose 
palestinian representatives for talks with israel on granting the 
territories limited autonomy 
the initiative collapsed over disagreement on the composition of 
a palestinian delegation to preliminary talks 
israel refused to accept an american compromise on palestinian 
negotiators saying it was an attempt to bring in the palestine 
liberation organization through the back door us officials 
insisted this was not the intent 
the persian gulf crisis temporarily pushed middle east peace 
efforts to the sidelines but shamirs hardline stance has proven 
a major stran on usisraeli relations 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said shamir would raise the issue 
of additional us financial aid for soviet immigration but 
refused to say how much shamir would ask for 
we hope it will be discussed without connections without 
conditions he said the jerusalem post newspaper said shamir 
would ask for billions of dollars in additional us housing loan 
guarantees

gov george deukmejian has called a 
special session of the legislature saying lawmakers cant afford 
to wait until january for his successor to handle the states 
worsening budget problems 
the special session if approved by the legislators will 
coincide with the beginning of the legislatures new biennial 
regular session monday but it would allow quicker action because 
it sidesteps some regular session rules 
the republican governor who did not run for reelection this 
year told a news conference wednesday that voters would be upset 
if legislators delayed budget action until govelect pete wilson 
takes office 
the people did not send us here simply to delay or duck 
current problems deukmejian said 
he said he wants the special session for action on the plan he 
proposed two weeks ago to cut 1 billion from the 55 billion state 
budget passed in july he suggested the cuts after tax revenues 
fell more than 400 million short of estimates for the first four 
months of the fiscal year 
assembly speaker willie brown dsan francisco canceled a 
12day european trip so he can name committees for the special 
session said press secretary michael reese but he said brown 
would prefer to wait to meet with the new governor rather than take 
immediate action at a special session 
his feeling is that a hastily called session in the month of 
december is probably not the most conducive time to deal with these 
issues reese said 
senate minority leader ken maddy said the call was a sincere 
effort on the part of governor deukmejian to solve this budget 
crisis and the legislature should respond 
the current budget contains a 13 billion emergency reserve 
but the falling revenues are expected to wipe that out 
deukmejian said the additional cuts he proposed would give us 
enough of a cushion to insure we would end up this year in the 
black 
wilson must propose a new budget on jan 10 taking into account 
a 43 billion gap between revenues and expenditures predicted by 
the commission on state finance 
deukmejian last week issued an executive order that asked state 
agencies to cut their budgets by 1 percent and froze state hiring 
and purchases 
the governor said the states top bond rating was in danger of 
being reduced if the legislature does not act quickly

a white policeman once cleared in the 
slaying of a black teenager faces prosecution after a second 
investigation and the mans lawyer accused the state attorney 
general of bowing to political pressure 
a grand jury wednesday indicted gary spath 29 on a charge of 
reckless manslaughter for shooting 16yearold phillip pannell in 
the back the april 10 shooting in teaneck touched off race riots 
and divided the town a new york city suburb of 39000 that for 
many years prided itself on good race relations 
defense attorney robert galantucci accused attorney general 
robert del tufo of bowing to political pressure in seeking the 
indictment after an earlier grand jury refused to bring charges 
this is an obvious example of the attorney general in the 
state of new jersey throwing a bone to a segment of the 
community he said in the process hes thrown officer spath 
to the wolves but thats only temporary 
del tufo defending his handling of the case cited errors in 
the autopsy report given to the original grand jury 
spaths arraignment was scheduled for dec 20 del tufos office 
said 
at a news conference at their englewood home today pannells 
parents said the indictment sent a positive message to the 
community but said spath should have been charged with murder 
i dont like what he got because i feel he should have got 
murder thelma pannell said i thank god that the truth will 
finally come out 
a candlelight vigil in memory of pannell turned into a rampage 
april 11 dozens of youths overturned police cars smashed windows 
and looted stores 
since then pannell supporters have held marches and the rev 
jesse jackson and nation of islam leader louis farrakhan have 
visited police and other supporters of spath also have held a 
rally 
police said pannell was reaching for a gun in his pocket when he 
was shot but witnesses said his hands were above his head as if in 
surrender and an autopsy by a pathologist hired by pannells 
family supported that contention 
spath could get up to 10 years in prison if convicted 
i know the truth in this matter he said after the 
indictment one good thing about this is that the truth will come 
out

as he left jerusalem district court but police whisked him away 
unharmed israel radio reported

given the settler shimon yifrah a sevenmonth suspended sentence 
the victim 17yearold intissar al ataar was killed on nov 
10 1987 in the gaza strips deir el balah refugee camp 
her death was a factor contributing to the outbreak of the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip a month later 
yifrah and three other people were driving past palestinian 
girls throwing stones and were already out of danger when they 
turned around and chased after the girls the jerusalem post 
newspaper quoted the high court as saying in its decision 
wednesday 
the justices rejected claims that the settlers shot in the air 
noting that the bullet struck miss al ataar at a height of about 
three feet from the ground 
it can be assumed that the respondent meant to fire in the 
direction that the bullet went the justices said a shot in 
the direction of the schoolyard where the girls were constituted 
gross negligenceand indifference to human life 
in other developments palestinians observed a general strike 
called by the moslem fundamentalist group hamas to mark the 43rd 
anniversary of the un vote to partition palestine paving the way 
for the establishment of israel

responsibility for killing lufti kamel al sadi 51 whose body was 
found in the jenin refugee camp he had been beaten stabbed and 
burned hospital officials said

police uncovered a plot to kill president bush during his visit 
here next week but government officials said the report was 
unfounded 
there is no confirmation of supposed plans to assassinate 
president bush interior minister julio mera figueroa said the 
us embassy refused to comment on the report by the sensationalist 
daily tabloid diario popular 
police arrested a bolivian on suspicion of membership in a 
terrorist group but the federal judge in charge of the case 
alberto duran said there is no evidence of a plan against the 
life of mr bush 
the bolivian was identified as carlos anibal monzon novena 41 
diario popular claimed monzon novena was the leader of a group 
called the union of revolutionary workers that planned to 
attack bush during his 22hour visit in argentian on dec 5 and 6 
the paper reported that monzon novena was imprisoned from 1977 
to 1983 during the military dictatorship for alleged guerrilla 
activities and that his group is a spinoff of the revolutionary 
army of the people that tried to overthrow argentinas governments 
of the early 1970s 
government and us embassy officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said no evidence has been put forward that the diario 
popular report is true

federal aviation officials criticized stapleton 
international airport last summer for failing to properly inspect 
its fueling facilities including the tank farm ravaged by a fire 
this week 
but federal avaiation administration spokesman mitch baker said 
the criticism stemmed from minor problems these are not 
significant items we dont feel they are of major importance he 
said 
firefighters are trying to determine what caused the fire which 
burned for more than 50 hours before it was smothered tuesday 
the blaze broke out sunday morning and spread to three other 
tanks before it was doused though the fire itself did not disrupt 
air traffic thousands of passengers had flights delayed sunday 
one of the busiest flying days of the year because they couldnt 
get enough fuel at stapleton 
fire capt gregory taft said firefighters believe the fire broke 
out in a holding pit that contains the pipes and filtering valves 
the city of denver as owner of the airport is responsible for 
safety inspections at fueling facilities under faa regulations that 
went into effect in january 1989 the faa inspects the entire 
airport to make sure denver is complying with safety regulations 
last june faa inspectors noted airport officials failed to 
inspect fueling facilities every three months as required 
denver aviation director george doughty said the inspection 
problems did not contribute to the fire he blamed the lack of 
inspections on manpower 
the faa letter also warned airport officials that denver did 
not maintain its fueling standards for protecting against fire and 
explosions in storage and dispensing fuel on the airport 
doughty said that issue referred to a small leak from a fuel 
pump near one of the united airlines tanks that caught fire the 
leak was noted during the june 22 inspection but doughty said it 
did not contribute to the fire which began in a different tank

chalices said police from the unit that tracks down stolen art

police spotted the works wrapped in rags inside and staked out 
the shack for several days in hopes of making arrests but concern

police and fire unions filed suit today 
seeking to prevent use of pension assets to keep the city from 
going broke 
the fraternal order of police and the philadelphia fire fighters 
union a local of the international association of fire fighters 
filed the lawsuit in common pleas court against the pension board 
and its members individually 
at an emergency hearing today before judge nicholas 
dalessandro attorneys for the unions asked for a temporary 
restraining order barring the board from investing pension assets 
in philadelphia shortterm notes or even voting on any proposal 
involving such an investment 
dalessandro rejected the request for the temporary order and 
set a hearing for monday 
ralph j teti chief deputy city solicitor had argued the 
motion was premature because no formal proposal had been made to 
the pension board john k weston representing the unions said 
the court action was needed to ensure against a precipitous 
investment 
once this money is transferred its gone weston said 
the 15 billion pension fund is one of four sources identified 
nov 9 by mayor w wilson goode and other democratic leaders as 
potential backers of an emergency 250 million to 300 million sale 
of shortterm notes to keep the city afloat until taxes come due 
next spring 
the democratic leaders also urged backing from local banks the 
state treasury and private investors for the note sale but city 
finance director elizabeth c reveal has called the pension funds 
role the linchpin of the deal 
the pension fund normally could not invest in notes of the 
quality philadelphia is able to offer because the citys credit 
rating has sunk to junkbond levels the lowest among the nations 
major cities 
city council voted 116 last week to authorize an investment in 
any philadelphia debt obligations regardless of quality through 
july 1 the board of pensions and retirement has yet to take up the 
issue 
the loan has been opposed from the start by the police and fire 
unions 
two other major city unions both affiliated with the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees last week 
said all options for resolving the fiscal crisis should remain 
open they said they had not decided whether to support an actual 
purchase of city notes 
in addition to the shortterm notes the democratic leaders also 
urged 140 million in longterm deficit financing and the sale of 
90 million in city assets to offset the fiscal 1991 deficit

a scientist is sticking to his 
projection of a 5050 chance of an earthquake in the midwest next 
week his daughter says 
however iben browning is most concerned about the chance of an 
earthquake in japan evelyn browning garriss said wednesday 
that doesnt mean we stop being concerned about new madrid or 
less concerned about new madrid she said in a telephone 
interview from her home in suburban tijeras 
hes probably more concerned about japan than any other place 
including new madrid but he continues to see a 5050 
possibility for new madrid and he hasnt made any changes except 
to be a little less worried about the hayward fault in northern 
california 
browning created a furor across the midwest when he said there 
was a strong chance of a major earthquake dec 23 in an area that 
includes the new madrid fault from arkansas through missouri to 
illinois 
earthquake experts and other scientists have discounted 
brownings projection which relies on the measurement of the pull 
of tidal forces on the earth 
but the experts have said the region will probably have a major 
quake eventually the new madrid fault was the site of a series of 
severe quakes in 181112 that were felt as far away as the east 
coast 
brownings daughter said he has always been equally concerned 
about the chances of quakes outside the united states as his 
figures have been computed on the basis of solarlunar 
gravitational stress on latitudes 30 to 60 which include most of 
north america asia and europe 
browning who also lives in tijeras was on vacation and 
unreachable for comment at an undisclosed location wednesday she 
said

egyptians voted for parliamentary candidates 
today under new election rules intended to make the procedure 
fairer but opposition groups boycotted the balloting which 
occurred amid sporadic violence 
president hosni mubaraks governing new democratic party was 
expected to maintain its dominance in the 454seat unicameral 
legislature the peoples assembly mubarak has held majorities of 
more than 75 percent in the three parliaments since he became 
president in 1981 
mubarak suspended the old parliament in september after egypts 
supreme court declared the chamber was elected in 1987 under an 
unconstitutional law violating the principle of equal opportunity 
for candidates 
in response mubarak decreed a new election law switching from 
a party list system to individual campaigns by party members and 
independents alike 
a national referendum last month authorized him to dissolve the 
assembly and call new elections 
the moves angered opposition leaders who complained they were 
not consulted and that mubarak ignored their demand to scrap a 
9yearold emergency law giving the government extensive arbitrary 
police powers they also wanted members of the judiciary to oversee 
all 23000 polling stations nationwide 
the government maintained that the emergency law remains a vital 
tool against terrorism but promised not to use it for its 
political benefit the government also said it lacked the resources 
to supervise the polls 
while voting at a polling station in suburban heliopolis where 
he lives mubarak criticized opposition leaders for the boycott 
adding that some had circumvented the protest by running as 
independents 
maybe they know they are unable to win mubarak said but 
a large number of candidatesentered the race as independents 
anyway 
mubarak added that the opposition parties should participate 
if they want democracy they should not be passive the parties 
that stayed away from the election included the fundamentalist 
moslem brotherhood which has been banned since 1954 but is 
tolerated by the government 
the rightofcenter new wafd leftofcenter socialist labor and 
centrist liberal parties also boycotted in the disbanded assembly 
they comprised the largest opposition ever almost 100 seats 
besides the governing party two small parties that have never 
made it into parliament ran the moslem fundamentalist umma party 
and the leftist national unionist progressive party 
three small parties established this year and unknown to many 
egyptians also campaigned the greens young egypt and the 
democratic unionists 
balloting was interupted by two exchanges of gunfire between 
sympathizers of rival candidates in the suez canal city of ismailia 
and beni suef in southern egypt security sources said 
they said two people were seriously wounded in ismailia

more than six decades after ettore bugatti produced 
the car that became a symbol of the highliving roaring 20s a firm 
is reviving the bugatti 
its come a long way the new car goes 220 mph and has six 
gears is designed to resemble a jet fighter and costs up to 
600000 if you must ask 
and in a feature of truly historic snobappeal proportions it 
can be purchased only by people deemed worthy by the company 
you must of course have the means to acquire one states 
romano artioli chairman of the board of bugatti automobili but 
above all you must have the right moral qualities otherwise we 
dont sell to you 
bugattis autos were among the most famous of the classic 
period from the 1920s to early 1940s when the luxurious speedy 
motorcar reached a peak 
kings capitalists and playboys flaunted them from king leopold 
iii of belgium to the wine baron philippe de rothschild 
even in the 1920s the firm was setting records for the most 
expensive standard vehicle with its long boxy bugatti royale the 
base price 20000 
in fact the highest price paid at auction for any car was 98 
million for a 1931 bugatti royale sold in 1987 at christies in 
london now at a factory near modena in the heart of italys 
sportscar industry bugatti is hoping to turn that legendary 
symbol of 1920s excess into a shiny symbol of 1990s excess 
according to plans the bugatti 110 will be a twoseater with 
fourwheel drive about 12 feet long and 3 feet tall 
its design was inspired by a fighterplane according to the 
company however judging by a sneak preview in the auto magazine 
quattro ruote four wheels it more closely resembles the 
batmobile 
it has 12 cylinders and a 3500cubiccentimeter fourturbo 
engine with 550 horsepower the power of a formula 1 car but 
more refined artioli said in a telephone interview 
bugatti officials say the car will cost at least 450000 
not a stratospheric price artioli reasons 
industry experts put the price at 600000 
while the car will not be unveiled until sept 15 the 110th 
anniversary of ettore bugattis birthday the orders have been 
rolling in for months 
we have the ambassador of an emirate that comes here every two 
months begging to have three cars artioli said we have big 
industrialists professionals they mail us their characteristics 
the details of their professions 
truly a most qualified group is battling to buy one of the 
150 cars produced each year he said 
what kind of people have the right moral qualities to part with 
a halfmillion dollars for a bugatti 
for example if its a person who has worked well in his life 
has a flourishing business if the person is esteemed admired and 
has a passion for these objects we doubtless can give him the 
car artioli said 
some would consider it risky to produce a luxury car at a moment 
when some major countries are facing recessions not artioli 
when these world crises happen there are always economic 
groups that grow in an outrageous way he explained those who 
work in the oil industry for example earn bags of moneyin this 
period 
arms dealers he said begin to breathe anew 
for those lacking the money or morals to buy the new bugatti 
there is one consolation the company also plans to come out with a 
line of bugatti accessories including sunglasses and watches

while thousands of foreigners are trying to flee 
iraq one soviet man wanted to go in the reverse direction and 
tried to hijack a plan to make the trip tass reported thursday 
the official soviet news agency quoted officials of the kgb 
secret police as saying a 63yearold retiree passed a note to the 
crew of a soviet airliner en route from moscow to syktyvkar in 
northern russia on wednesday 
nikolai pylev a handicapped man from the city of voronezh 
demanded to be flown to iraq tass said the flight commander 
ignored the demand and stayed on course pylev was arrested after 
the tupolev134 jetliner landed in syktyvkar tass said 
the brief dispatch did not give pylevs motive for demanding a 
trip to iraq which hundreds of soviet specialists have been trying 
to leave since president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
tass also did not say if pylev had a weapon

iraqi president saddam hussein said 
thursday he was not afraid of fighting the united states in the 
persian gulf and warned that he had the technology to shoot down 
stealth aircraft 
if war breaks out we will fight in a way which will make all 
arabs and moslems proud we are determined not to kneel down to 
injustice saddam said in remarks carried by baghdad radio 
the remarks came hours before the united nations security 
council was to vote on a ussponsored resolution authorizing the 
use of force to oust iraq from kuwait if saddam refuses to withdraw 
by jan 15 
in a defiant tone saddam said iraq will fight the united 
states and its other allies in the gulf if war breaks out 
there have been conflicting reports whether saddam might have 
the ability to detect the stealth jets designed to sneak in under 
enemy radar using technology sold to him by france 
the pentagon has sent 22 f117a stealth fighter bombers to 
unspecified bases in the region

the stench from a sewage dump here is so foul 
that officials tried to mask it with orange extract next theyll 
try lemon and they might even use the scent of vanilla or almonds 
if evening in paris or chanel no 5 was best wed use 
that said john casey executive director of the lynn water and 
sewer commission right now lemons the best 
the problem arose last week after workers started dumping sludge 
in a landfill near a new sewage treatment plant officials 
originally intended to burn the sludge at an incinerator but they 
are awaiting state permission 
in the meantime crews have covered the sludge with gravel and 
lime but that hasnt stopped the odors 
casey explained that the sludge is soupy and as bulldozers 
spread the gravel they also dig up some of the slop from the day 
before 
this does not cause too much trouble when the wind is blowing 
from the west which carries the odors over the ocean but when the 
wind comes from the east the stench is blown over the city 
its not a pleasant smell casey said i wouldnt want my 
bedroom windows open at night with this blowing in 
after receiving complaints the commission this week bought 
about 80 quarts of orange extract mixed it with water and sprayed 
it over the dump 
this fruity smell has helped somewhat casey said thursday he 
was awaiting a shipment of lemon extract which is less expensive 
other alternatives are vanilla and almond extract but casey said 
he hopes to have permission to burn the sludge next week 
the plant sits in an industrial area where depending on the 
wind direction people can catch scents from a potato chip factory 
and a fish processing plant casey said 
but the smell from sludge is not a very good smell he said 
yet despite the steps to eliminate the odors some people 
apparently will never be satisfied casey said officials received 
an anonymous complaint about the orange smell they asked why are 
we dumping rotten oranges he said 
but generally speaking oranges smell better he said

the united states would literally 
call the shots in any military strike to free kuwait backed by 
britain probably france and an arab force that symbolically would 
be first over the border 
more than two dozen countries have sent troops to defend saudi 
arabia from an iraqi attack but few have said they would cross the 
border to liberate kuwait arab governments except kuwait have 
been noticeably silent 
a resolution before the un security council on thursday only 
sets conditions for the allies to decide on military action if iraq 
has not withdrawn from kuwait by jan 15 it does not mandate force 
if iraq refuses 
the united states has publicly stressed the multinational 
character of the military force strung out across hundreds of miles 
of saudi desert 
if theres a military confrontation its not going to be 
america vs iraq its going to be 26 nations vs iraq said rep 
nicholas mavroules dmass he led a 20member congressional 
delegation on a visit to troops wednesday 
but the us military commitment is so overwhelming that it 
dwarfs the 150000 other troops in saudi arabia the americans have 
240000 personnel in the region and 200000 more coming by 
midjanuary 80 us warships and more than 1000 combat aircraft 
will be deployed in the middle east 
at present saudi forces are flanked on the west by syrian and 
french troops and on the east by the egyptians with us and 
british troops right behind 
a wellplaced saudi said on condition of anonymity that the 
saudis kuwaitis egyptians and persian gulf nations would 
participate in any offensive and not symbolically 
but the syrians have never spelled out what they are prepared to 
do beyond the original mission of defending saudi arabia pakistan 
with the only other significant islamic force says its troops are 
purely defensive 
french foreign minister roland dumas said nov 27 that france 
would deploy its forces alongside the americans in any military 
action but did not make clear whether france would put its forces 
under us tactical control 
one strong indication that the united states isnt taking most 
of the multinational force seriously in military terms is that 
after nearly four months there has not been one exercise involving 
all or even most nations 
there have been some exercises with the saudis and british the 
only one close to a serious international effort was an allarms 
exercise involving us and saudi marines and american british 
french and canadian aircraft 
under an agreement between king fahd and secretary of state 
james a baker iii the united states would command any offensive 
outside saudi arabia but must get permission from the king to 
launch an attack from saudi soil 
the saudi us and british commanders have offices in the same 
building in riyadh and meet regularly but reporters in the field 
have seen little evidence of similar coordination on the ground 
the british commander lt gen sir peter de la billiere said 
monday that coordination of air and naval forces was working 
extremely well but he indicated integrated ground operations 
were still only at a planning level 
im quite sure if it came to an offensive operation the right 
sort of arrangements for command and directing the forces would 
emerge he said 
unquestionably the winter months would be best for an 
offensive its cooler and the occasional rain softens the ground 
and diminishes dust making clandestine operations easier 
sandstorms are a nuisance for both sides 
but col andrew duncan of londons international institute for 
strategic studies said too much was being made of the weather and 
noted that the allies in world war ii fought through the summer in 
the desert 
he said he did not believe however there would be any 
offensive until us commanders had the mix of men and equipment 
they want for a strike 
the allies already have air and naval superiority so the key 
would be the arrival of ground reinforcements to take on iraq 
the pentagon says iraqi president saddam hussein has 450000 
troops in kuwait and southern iraq and is sending in 250000 more 
men 
the new us armored divisions coming from germany and the 
united states are the key to an offensive operation once they 
arrive they will need at least two weeks to acclimatize and test 
equipment 
in addition the united states is changing its older m1 abrams 
tanks for topoftheline m1a1 models which it would undoubtedly 
want to use in a strike against kuwait

gunfire crackled through the bangladesh 
capital thursday as police battled protesters demanding the ouster 
of president hussain muhammad ershad and an end to a state of 
emergency witnesses said 
opposition leaders said 50 people were killed and more than 
1000 wounded wednesday when demonstrators swarmed into the streets 
of dhaka and four other cities in defiance of curfews 
the casualty toll could not be verified the claims were made in 
written statements circulated in dhaka that reached india through 
unofficial channels some previous claims of the opposition have 
been exaggerated 
diplomatic sources in new delhi said they had reports of four 
dead and 15 wounded in the bangladesh capital during clashes with 
paramilitary forces wednesday 
the curfews were imposed tuesday night as part of a state of 
emergency ershad declared to try to quash the growing movement 
against him the decree also suspended civil rights and imposed 
press censorship after six weeks of oftenviolent protests 
ershad a former general is facing one of his worst crises 
since seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1982 the diplomatic 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said his support in 
the army appeared less solid than earlier believed 
witnesses said demonstrations continued thursday but they did 
not know about casualties 
kurt hensena a businessman based in hong kong said he heard 
gunfire when he left his dhaka hotel for the airport thursday 
afternoon he said there were rumors one person was killed 
it was bambambambam and then it was quiet again it was 
shotgun rifle fire i heard a lot of people shouting hensena 
said upon arrival in bangkok thailand he did not give his 
nationality 
the witnesses said fighting was heavier on wednesday 
yesterday and today it was mostly rockthrowing said an 
american also arriving in bangkok on the first flight from dhaka 
since ershads crackdown tuesday night he and some other travelers 
spoke on condition they were not identified 
a dutch traveler said he had been trapped by roadblocks 
wednesday and his car was stoned as he drove through the crowd 
there was shooting and there was some burning of cars he said 
about 300 students gathered outside dhaka university during 
curfew hours chanting down with ershad and we dont accept 
curfew no emergency said unofficial reports reaching new delhi 
security forces were not in the area during the halfhour 
demonstration 
bangladeshis jammed dhakas food stores during a fourhour 
relaxation of the curfew while army troops patrolled the streets 
said another report from the city of 7 million 
press censorship was severe an associated press story from 
dhaka was reduced from 14 paragraphs to four by government censors 
telephone and telex communications were restored thursday after 
being severed for nearly 24 hours 
ershads political opponents want him to step aside in favor of 
a caretaker government which would supervise elections they accuse 
him of rigging an earlier presidential election and two 
parliamentary elections and say a fair vote is impossible as long 
as he remains in office 
ershad 60 has called another presidential election for next 
year and has invited international observers to attend 
though ershad has given bangladesh a measure of political 
stability after a quick succession of militaryinstalled 
presidents he has made little headway in alleviating the misery of 
his 110 million people who are collectively among the worlds 
poorest 
bangladesh formerly east pakistan won its independence from 
west pakistan in a 1971 civil war since then it has never changed 
leaders by election

consumer spending the driving force behind 
eight years of us economic expansion did not budge in october 
the government said thursday in a report analysts contend was 
further evidence of a recession 
the consumer has retrenched said economist gilbert benz of 
the swiss bank corp in new york it clearly supports those who 
say were in a recession 
john silvia an economist with kemper financial services in 
chicago agreed 
it looks like consumer spending will be negative in the fourth 
quarter and the gross national product will decline in both the 
current quarter and the first three months of next year he said 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity was unchanged from september at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 373 trillion the commerce department 
said personal incomes rose just 01 percent to a 471 trillion 
rate 
the marginal increase in incomes failed to match the 06 percent 
increase in the labor departments consumer price index in october 
it also was the smallest gain since incomes were unchanged in 
august 1989 spending had posted gains each month since last may 
when it was unchanged 
disposable incomes or incomes after taxes also inched ahead 
01 percent down from a 04 percent gain the previous month it 
was the smallest gain since aftertax incomes fell 01 percent last 
april 
the spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation 
when adjusted spending actually fell 07 percent after a 02 
percent increase in september disposable income dropped 05 
percent even more than the 04 percent declines in the previous 
two months 
consumer spending can survive a lot of things temporary 
shocks consumer confidence oil surprises but three months in a 
row of negative disposable income suggests that people are going to 
have to cut back even more silvia said 
indeed federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on wednesday 
noted that shrinking employment and the number of hours worked were 
causing personal income to decline while rising energy prices are 
squeezing many household budgets 
this drop in real purchasing power along with plunging 
consumer sentiment does not bode well for the nearterm trends in 
consumer demand he told the house banking committee 
it was the first look at consumer spending in the final quarter 
of the year the department on wednesday revised personal 
consumption in the third quarter down from a 36 percent annual 
rate in its initial report to 32 percent suggesting spending was 
slowing toward the end of that period 
there was weakness across the board in october benz noted 
theres every indication that consumers are spending less on 
everything 
purchases of durable goods usually expensive products expected 
to last at least three years fell 84 billion in october 
nondurable consumption was off 15 billion and while spending on 
services rose 89 billion the advance was slower than the gains 
of 135 billion in september and 211 billion in august 
a key component of the income category wages and salaries 
fell 93 billion after gaining 167 billion the previous month 
it was the first decline since november 1989 when it dropped 76 
billion 
silvia said the major prop in the 01 percent gain in overall 
personal income was transfer payments such as unemployment 
insurance and costofliving adjustments in the food stamp program 
both further evidence of a weak economy 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income edged up to 38 percent from 36 percent in september the 
september rate was the lowest since a 35 percent rate in january 
1988 and an indication that consumers having to dip into their 
savings to pay for their purchases 
americans savings rate for all of 1989 was 46 percent

premier andrei lukanov and his government 
of former communists resigned today bowing to unrelenting pressure 
from the streets and the halls of parliament 
the socialist premier blamed for the balkan countrys political 
and economic anarchy said union and the government opposition had 
made it impossible for his government to implement its economic 
reform program 
for me it is therefore pointless to remain at the premiers 
post and i resign my office the state bta news agency 
quoted him as saying 
no replacement was immediately named for lukanov one of the 
reformminded socialist party members who helped oust longtime 
communist leader todor zhivkov last november lukanov 52 was 
appointed premier in early february 
lukanovs resignation had been expected since he and other 
political leaders struck a deal in talks to end their stalemate 
that has prevented the country from tackling its worst postwar 
economic crisis 
the accord was struck in a meeting called by president zhelyu 
zhelev as a nationwide strike entered its fourth day and streets 
filled with thousands of people demanding an end to political 
turmoil and economic hardship 
bulgaria is suffering its worst postwar crisis electricity is 
rationed in sofia and elsewhere many basic consumer items are 
either rationed or unavailable the country cannot make payments on 
its 11 billion foreign debt 
the political stalemate has blocked officials from moving 
quickly to improve the economic situation 
the new government should neither be dominated by the bsp or 
the udf the premier should be a neutral personality alexander 
lilov the socialist party chairman said just before the talks 
that produced the accord 
he referred to his own party the bulgarian socialist party and 
the main opposition union of democratic forces which has said it 
wants to take over from the socialists and does not want to join a 
socialistdominated government 
the former communist party which ruled bulgaria for four 
decades renamed itself the socialist party during the 
prodemocracy movements that swept eastern europe late last year 
and went on to win june elections 
only last week lukanov survived a noconfidence vote in 
parliament and won approval of his austerity budget after the 
opposition walked out of the chamber he had threatened to resign 
if the budget was not approved but said he could not be heckled 
into quitting 
during the protests today many intersections in the capital 
were blocked by angry citizens who had built barricades with 
benches garbage cans and large concrete planters but the two 
largest trade unions podkrepa which called a nationwide walkout 
that began monday and the confederation of independent trade 
unions condemned the street protests 
the confederation bulgarias largest union had opposed the 
nationwide strike but announced wednesday it would join the walkout 
if the government crisis was not settled

president bush expressed deep 
disappointment thursday as he signed a crimecontrol bill that he 
said was a shadow of his own 1989 proposal 
the bill passed in the final hours of this years congressional 
session toughens penalties for certain whitecollar crimes 
including a possible life prison term for some cases involving 
fraud by savings and loan officials 
it also calls for increased penalties for offenses committed 
against children including for the first time making possession of 
child pornography a federal offense 
stripped from the bill however were bushs proposals for a 
death penalty for new categories of federal crimes including mail 
bombing terrorist murder and assassination of federal officers 
also gone from the final version were the administrations 
provisions to allow courts to consider evidence gathered with 
flawed warrants to shorten delays in carrying out executions and 
to impose tougher penalties for illegal firearm use 
these provisions although in earlier versions of the 
legislation were jettisoned from the bill by a housesenate 
conference committee as it struggled to come up with a politically 
acceptable compromise 
also removed from the bill was a ban on assault weapons not 
proposed by the administration which the senate had added 
i must note my deep disappointment over many provisions 
noticeably absent from the legislation bush said in a statement 
i call on congress to implement the remainder of the 
comprehensive crime package which fell short of becoming law this 
session bush added the american people deserve tough new 
laws to help us prevail in the fight against drugs and crime 
at the same time bush said while this is not the crime bill 
i asked congress to pass i am pleased with the tools it provides 
for fighting financial institutions fraud 
the measure sets up in the justice department an office of 
special counsel for financial institutions fraud 
in addition the bill enhances the ability of the federal 
banking agencies and the department of justice to seize the assets 
of wrongdoers and makes it more difficult for those wrongdoers to 
use bankruptcy to avoid civil or criminal penalties bushs 
statement said

president saddam hussein said today he was 
not afraid of fighting the united states in the persian gulf and 
warned that he had the technology to shoot down stealth aircraft 
if war breaks out we will fight in a way which will make all 
arabs and moslems proud we are determined not to kneel down to 
injustice saddam said in remarks carried by baghdad radio 
the remarks came hours before the un security council was to 
vote on a ussponsored resolution authorizing the use of force to 
oust iraq from kuwait if saddam refuses to withdraw by jan 15 
in a defiant tone saddam said iraq will fight the united 
states and its other allies in the gulf if war breaks out the 
radio said the speech was made to an arab youth solidarity seminar 
there have been conflicting reports whether saddam might have 
the ability to detect the stealth jets designed to sneak in under 
enemy radar using technology sold to him by france the pentagon 
has sent 22 f117a stealth fighter bombers to unspecified bases in 
the region 
earlier today saddam issued a statement on the official iraqi 
news agency accusing the united states of forcing the united 
nations to adopt a double standard by supporting resolutions that 
condemn iraq but not israel 
also today iraqs ruling party newspaper althawra lashed out 
at the proposed un resolution calling it a declaration of 
war 
in his iraqi news agency statement saddam urged the 15nation 
council to link any resolution of the gulf crisis with the 
israelipalestinian problem a position he first insisted on soon 
after invading kuwait on aug 2 
the united states has refused such a linkage 
we have been and still are hoping the united nations and the 
security council will seize the opportunityto tackle all 
problems of the area seriously and lay down all united rules and 
arrangements that would ensure their solution on the same basis and 
principles ina quoted saddam as saying 
the iraqi government has said it would abide by un resolutions 
on the gulf only if the world body enforced resolutions calling on 
israel to withdraw from territories it seized in the 1967 middle 
east war 
in his ina statement saddam said 
the united states in addition to its protection of this 
entity israel through vetoing resolutions that condemn its 
practices pushes the security council to adopt dual standards in 
dealing with issues of the region 
the statement released on the occasion of the world day for 
solidarity with the palestinian people also applauded the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as a 
continuation of the revolutions of the people of palestine that 
started with the balfour declaration 
it referred to the 1917 pledge by lord arthur james balfour the 
british foreign secretary that britain would support a jewish 
state in palestine and the creation of the state of israel three 
decades later 
saddam also condemned the influx of hundreds of thousands of 
emigrants from the soviet union and eastern europe into the 
occupied palestinian territories as a scheme for the 
establishment of greater israel 
the newspaper of saddams arab baath socialist party suggested 
the un resolution could provoke a backlashin the final 
analysis increased oppression is coupled with increased resistance 
by the oppressed and they become forced to confront it althawra 
said 
the newspaper recalled guerrilla operations of palestinians 
egyptians and lebanese and said the message and moral of these 
operations is clear 
the us resolution being prepared by the security council 
against iraq is not only a blatant violation of all standards of 
humanity peace and legality but is a declaration of war on all 
the good and honorable forces in the world althawra said 
althawra also condemned the resolution on monday and wednesday 
in the only previous official iraqi comment on it 
the united states has used heavy sticks to pressure other 
international parties or make deals to buy out their agreements in 
a highdemand market for buying stands and guarantees the paper 
claimed 
iraq has amassed an estimated 450000 troops in the region 
the united states has about 230000 soldiers in the area mostly 
across the border in saudi arabia along with a multinational force 
of about 100000 other troops washington plans to send about 
200000 more soldiers in the coming weeks to place it on an 
offensive footing

alaskas citizen diplomats say its 
time to extend more across the bering strait to their soviet 
neighbors than good will 
they want to send food to help ease that countrys food 
shortages 
were talking about our friends joe davis presidentelect 
of nomes rotary club said wednesday 
for business leaders in nome a city just 230 miles from the 
soviet far east the news of food shortages in the soviet union 
was a call to action that also demanded a delicate touch 
were going to send some food as a holiday cultural gesture 
around christmas he said that way it would help the soviets 
save face too 
it wouldnt come across as us saying hi i heard youre 
starving heres some food said davis who spent a month last 
year teaching english in the soviet far east city of providenya 
during the past few years alaskans have been sponsoring school 
children folk singers business leaders teachers journalists 
artists and pilots on dozens of friendship missions back and forth 
across the bering strait 
davis said the rotary club probably would just send food and not 
include a delegation to make sure it was distributed to people who 
need it 
that was a key concern of german leaders who won assurances from 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev that a delegation would oversee 
distribution of a massive shipment of food 
vic fischer a university of alaska at anchorage professor who 
directs alaskasoviet exchanges said even smallscale relief 
should be monitored as during the huge flow of international aid 
after the 1988 armenian earthquake 
fischer said he hoped to have a donation from alaska ready in 
time for a flight from anchorage to the soviet far east city of 
magadan in january 
whatever we are able to collect must not wind up in the 
communist party chiefs storerooms fischer said 
alaskans may have an edge there he said since many people have 
connections that could check losses to illicit sources such as 
blackmarkets

president bush endorsing the first major 
rewrite of the immigration law in a quartercentury today approved 
a substantial boost in the number of immigrants allowed into the 
united states each year 
this bill is good for familiies good for business good for 
crime fighting and good for america bush said at a white house 
signing ceremony 
immigration is not just a link to americas past it is also a 
bridge to americas future he said as he signed the bill 
increasing by 400000 the number of immigrants that will be 
accepted over the next three years that will make a total of 21 
million 
it also will ease restrictions on visitors once barred for being 
communist or having other views unacceptable to the government the 
curbs dated to the anticommunist fervor of the 1950s 
but the secretary of state still will be able to bar individuals 
for political reasons 
bush said the bill revises the exclusion grounds for the first 
time since enactment in 1952 putting an end to the kind of 
political litmus test that might have excluded even some of the 
heroes of the eastern european revolution of 1989 
the american bar association praised the bill for its general 
provisions but said it was disturbed by provisions which may 
impede the ability of persons in immigration proceedings to secure 
representation and could block some political asylum applicants 
legal scholar david cole said the bill leaves too many loopholes 
for exclusion on political and ideological grounds because it 
gives the administration discretionary powers in cases it deems to 
involve terrorism and foreign policy considerations 
cole a professor at georgetown university law center said the 
law will continue to deny immigrants the very freedoms of belief 
and association upon which this nation of immigrants was founded 
the national gay and lesbian task force lauded the reversal of a 
bar on homosexual immigrants the bill also drops automatic 
exclusion of aids patients leaving it up to the administration 
whether to list aids as a disease that prevents immigrants from 
entering 
gay groups are calling on bush to refrain from listing aids as 
an exclusionary disease the world is watching to see whether he 
is going to strike aids from that list said gaytask force 
spokesman robert bray 
the ball is entirely in his court he said 
the immigration law also will allow for naturalization of 
filipinos who have served in the us military or phillipines army 
or guerrilla units in world war two 
the measure aims primarily to reunite families but it also will 
open the door to people with special skills and those who are 
wealthy 
it reserves 140000 visas a year for immigrants with special 
skills up from 54000 in the past and 10000 visas are set aside 
for those with at least 500000 to invest in businesses that 
create new jobs 
the measure earmarks 48000 visas a year for individuals from 
italy poland ireland and other countries virtually shut off from 
immigration in the last 20 years 
immigrants from these countries have been turned down largely 
because preference was given to those with family members here 
already but many of those rejected have stayed in the united 
states illegally 
the bills sweeping provisions mark the first time immigration 
policy has been reworked since 1965 it will allows a threeyear 
total of 21 million visas for permanent residence up from 17 
million in the previous threeyear period 
congress in passing the immigration law foaused on how to 
balance the huge influx of asian and latin american immigrants with 
europeans 
refugees are dealt with separately because they are not 
considered in the same category as immigrants 
aside from the immigration bill a large number of permanent 
visas will be given to people already in this country as the 
government carries out an amnesty law allowing mexicans who are 
here illegally to gain legal status

us ambassador ryan crocker restaffed 
the us embassy on thursday nearly 15 months after it was 
evacuated underlining american support for president elias hrawis 
efforts to end the civil war 
crocker who presented his credentials to hrawi in a 30minute 
ceremony said his biggest priority would be to secure the release 
of 13 westerners missing in lebanon among them six americans 
the decision to send crocker despite the stilltenuous security 
situation reflects us backing for hrawis efforts to create a 
militiafree capital and end 15 years of civil war 
crocker 51 a career diplomat who served in lebanon as a 
political officer in the early 1980s said after the ceremony at 
hrawis temporary residence that he was returning at a time that 
i think offers the best hope any of us have seen for lebanon since 
1975 
asked how long he would stay in lebanon crocker said im 
having a good day here and will take it day by day 
crocker emphasised that the american hostages in lebanon were 
very much on my mind as i take on this role i want to see those 
americans home as do all their countrymen i will have no higher 
priority while im here than doing everything i can to secure their 
safe release 
the missing westerners most of whom are believed held by 
proiranian factions also include four britons two west germans 
and an italian the longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
greenbereted soldiers of the lebanese armys elite commando 
brigade provided security for crocker as he crossed into moslem 
west beirut to present his credentials in the seaside ramlet 
albaida district they surrounded his car with seven jeeps that 
sped across jammed streets with lights on and horns honking 
the ceremony occurred one day after crocker was flown by 
helicopter from cyprus to the us embassy compound in beiruts 
northern suburb of aukar 
crocker told reporters it was a wonderful experience to cross 
the length of beirut and see only lebanese army uniforms and guns 
only in the hands of the lebanese army 
that is a very favorable beginning and can give us all 
confidence that the great beirut plan will become the greater 
lebanon plan crocker said 
he was referring to the capitals militiafree zone a linchpin 
of hrawis efforts to end the civil war called greater beirut it 
stretches along a 15mile coastal strip from the kelb river in the 
north to the damour river in the south and covers the citys 
immediate eastern suburbs 
crocker who joined the state department in 1971 reopened the 
embassy for the first time since former ambassador john mccarthy 
and his staff evacuated on sept 6 1989 
the embassy was besieged at the time by supporters of rebel gen 
michel aoun the christian general who battled syrian troops 
backing the government since aouns defeat on oct 13 militias 
have been withdrawing from the capital 
in washington deputy state department spokesman richard 
boucherd said crocker was dispatched to beirut after a us 
security team inspected the situation in the lebanese capital last 
weekend 
crocker who speaks arabic also held diplomatic posts in iran 
qatar iraq and egypt 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the united states has discussed its decision to send in 
crocker with syria which backs hrawi with 40000 troops deployed 
in most of lebanon 
lebanons civil war has long been used as a proxy battleground 
for middle east disputes and american diplomatic personnel have 
been frequent targets 
american ambassador francis meloy and an economic counselor were 
assassinated in 1976 seventeen americans including top cia staff 
were killed by a truck bomb that destroyed the west beirut embassy 
in april 1983 the aukur embassy was damaged in september 1984 by a 
car bomber killing eight

federal regulators faced a full court 
press from five senators on behalf of charles keatings troubled 
lincoln savings and loan one of the regulators told the senate 
ethics committee today 
michael patriarca a savings and loan regulator based in san 
francisco said the socalled keating five senators seemed to 
have already made up their minds that the regulators were being too 
tough with keatings thrift when they were summoned to meet with 
the senators on april 9 1987 
the senators seemed to have made up their minds that we 
were in fact harassing lincoln that we were incorrect wrong 
patriarca said basically we got the fullcourt press 
patriarca western regional director for the office of thrift 
supervision took the witness stand in the ethics panels hearing 
into allegations the five senators improperly intervened with 
regulators on behalf of keatings thrift at a time when keating 
was a major financial contributor to their campaigns and causes 
patriarcas initial testimony generally supported that of his 
former boss edwin j gray who left the witness stand after four 
days of testimony gray the star witness and chief accuser stuck 
by his accusations that in a meeting he held with four senators 
the senators improperly pressured him and that one arizona 
democrat dennis deconcini offered him a deal on behalf of lincoln 
deconcini has strongly denied offering a deal 
gray concluded with a blast at congress for accepting campaign 
contributions from special interests and at the savings and loan 
industry for using that system to block his efforts to limit their 
risky practices 
i think the influence of the thrift lobby killed all the 
reforms that we sought gray said every single reform i 
introduced that i sent up to the banking committee never saw 
the light of day 
patriarca described a meeting he and three other san 
franciscobased regulators had with the five senators in the very 
building where the ethics panel is holding its hearings that 
meeting was held at the suggestion of gray who a week earlier had 
been called to a meeting with four of the senators 
patriarca said that in the meeting he attended deconcini acted 
as host and talked more frequently than the others 
it was my impression quite frankly that senator deconcini 
was negotiating on behalf of lincoln attempting to get us the 
regulators to change our position on the examination of 
lincoln patriarca said 
besides deconcini other senators at the meeting and under 
investigation are republican john mccain of arizona and democrats 
john glenn of ohio alan cranston of california and donald riegle 
of michigan 
the five face allegations they improperly intervened with 
regulators on behalf of keating who was a heavy financial 
contributor to their causes and campaigns 
patriarca said the regulators had found absolutely reckless 
practices by the irvine califbased savings and loan he said 
there was evidence the thrifts files had been stuffed with phony 
underwriting documents in an attempt to justify loans 
under further questioning patriarca said the fullcourt 
press by the senators lessened after the regulators revealed they 
planned to refer lincolns actions to the justice department for 
criminal investigation 
he described later efforts by lincoln to have its case 
transferred out of the jurisdiction of his san francisco regional 
office he said he opposed the move but jim boland chief of staff 
to grays successor as chief regulator m danny wall cited 
political considerations in justifying the transfer 
his response was there are things you dont understand 
were doing this for your own good these guys are so well 
connected they can get you in ways youll never know youve been 
gotten patriarca said 
bennett the special counsel said boland has denied making such 
a remark 
keatings californiabased thrift was seized by the government 
in 1989 with a 2 billion bailout cost to taxpayers and has 
become emblematic of the savings industry collapse 
gray finished his testimony today following a barrage of pointed 
questions from defense attorneys for the five enators who made a 
final attempt to discredit his testimony and integrity 
under more friendly questioning from committee counsel robert s 
bennett gray reaffirmed his assertion that he was ordered to bring 
no staff with him when he was summoned to the april 2 1987 
meeting with four of the senators he contends the directive came 
in a phone call from the office of deconcini but that he did not 
know who made the call 
im certain i was told not to bring staff i was told to come 
alone he said 
gray has contended that deconcini suggested a quid pro quo 
that lincoln would make more home mortgage loans if he would drop a 
regulation that placed strict limits on lincolns ability to make 
risky speculative investments in real estate and other ventures 
bennett read the transcript of closeddoor interviews two of the 
senators under investigation had with the committee and who were in 
that meeting both according to bennett did not dispute grays 
assertion though they did not confirm it either 
bennett quoted glenn as saying i do not recall whether that 
occurred or did not occur and he quoted mccain as saying i 
dont recall what happened i do not claim mr glenn is not 
telling the truth by any means

president bush signed legislation thursday 
giving the national transportation safety board more flexibility on 
when to release cockpit voice recorder transcripts after airline 
accidents 
the old law required the agency to release the transcript no 
later than 60 days after a crash 
now the ntsb will be able to release the transcript either when 
it holds a public hearing or when a majority of its staff reports 
on the accident are placed in the public record whichever comes 
first 
bush in a statement expressed concern that the courts provide 
prompt and complete disclosure to all sides in lawsuits arising 
out of aircraft accidents 
it is important to protect these materials from sensationalism 
and unwarranted disclosure but it is also important that courts 
provide prompt and complete disclosure to litigants bush said 
the measure also gives the ntsb clear authority to examine ships 
involved in accidents and guarantees the agency access to the 
results of drug tests on any air traffic controller or other 
department of transportation employee who tests positive after an 
accident 
it gives the board sole authority to determine what tests are 
conducted after an accident and who conducts them 
the independent board investigates major air sea and land 
accidents as well as pipeline mishaps

dwayne bouvier may be headed to the front 
line but the worry weighing heaviest on the heart and mind of the 
19yearold national guardsman isnt the thought of waging war 
its his wrecked wedding plans 
my fiancees not taking it very well we were supposed to get 
married in february the gowns are all paid for the hall is paid 
for the church was reserved we thought about moving it up but we 
couldnt get the church its a mess well just have to wait until 
i get back bouvier said 
bouvier a mechanic on a mississippi river barge serves in the 
louisiana national guards 141st field artillery battalion part of 
the 256th infantry brigade last week 4800 members of the brigade 
were called up for active service because of the troop buildup in 
the persian gulf 
like others in the unit bouviers life is taking an unexpected 
and risky detour since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and the united 
states responded by sending troops to saudi arabia 
though he joined the combat outfit two years ago bouvier never 
imagined he might be sent away from home perhaps never to return 
there was no threat back then bouvier said this week in an 
interview at the jackson barracks i never expected this to 
happen 
the 256th which is based in lafayette with units scattered 
across the state is a frontline infantry brigade it heads for 
fort polk this weekend for processing and some units will go to 
fort hood texas for training 
whether they will eventually be sent to the middle east isnt 
known yet officials said 
although they joined knowing they would be part of a fighting 
brigade most of the guardsmen called up said they never expected 
to face battle 
it bothers me a lot said spec 4 kenneth lewis 28 you 
know its an artillery unit and you train to fire those guns but i 
never did expect it to go somewhere 
lewis a registered practical nurse and a minister said its 
hard to make the transition from healing to hurting 
im trained to shoot those guns and if i have to i will but i 
lose a lot of sleep over it he said 
sgt robert folk 27 was to graduate from the university of new 
orleans in may 
ive accepted putting this part of my life on hold he said 
its hard on my family and my girlfriend theyre afraid for me 
to go afraid something will happen to me i try to reassure them 
but i have to cut it off at a point theyre afraid of the same 
things i might be scared of if i thought too much about them 
like many others lt robert boswell 25 joined to pay for his 
college education 
its been great it gave me free tuition and 140 a month 
plus 150 a month drill pay he said i thought id pay it back 
part time you know regular guard time i never expected to be 
called up but i dont regret it 
for nine years sgt mike mcdow has been a fulltime soldier in 
the guard making the shift to active duty was easy for him he 
said the hard part was notifying weekend soldiers there lives were 
about to change he said 
the worst part is talking to the parents mcdow said they 
think their son is going for six weeks of basic training then 
coming back and go to college

the agriculture departments no 2 official 
said thursday an export subsidy war is likely if the european 
community isnt willing to negotiate further in the final sessions 
of world trade talks next week 
deputy secretary jack c parnell said the bargaining nations 
scheduled to meet in brussels are looking at the final moments in 
the negotiations for liberalizing global agricultural trade 
a major hangup has been between the 12nation community and 
other nations over reducing internal tradedistorting farm 
supports and export subsidies 
the socalled uruguay round of negotiations has been going on 
for four years under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
if the europeans cant come to the gatt negotiating table in 
good faith and discuss concrete reductions in agricultural 
subsidies and the real measurable lowering of tariff walls then 
they are making the initial unfriendly moves of a subsidy war 
parnell said 
there is little doubt that the united states will retaliate 
using every tool available to us in order to maintain our market 
share he said 
parnell also told the concluding session of the departments 
annual outlook conference that us farmers could face even greater 
trade competition 
eastern europe has been liberalized and weve all rejoiced 
he said but suppose the rest of europe seduces these countries 
into joining its common agricultural policy 
parnell said that would mean the former east germany poland 
hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania all would be joining 
the existing bloc 
can you imagine an 18member common agricultural policy 
american farmers have many good reasons to support a gatt 
agreement not the least of which is holding onto their own 
financial prosperity he said

the businessman challenging lech walesa 
for the presidency advocates arming poland with 100 mediumrange 
nuclear missiles to ward off aggression and guard the countrys 
sovereignty 
stanislaw tyminski makes the argument in sacred dogs a 
selfpublished book which outlines his probusiness antitax and 
antiunion philosophies 
the 260page paperback initially printed in july and 
distributed by his campaign appears to contradict denials made 
during the campaign in an interview monday with the associated 
press tyminski denied he advocates nuclear weapons for poland 
tyminsmki was not available thursday to discuss his book 
campaign aide krzysztof pawlisz said that only the candidate could 
comment on the apparent contradiction 
tyminski also has branded as lies lies lies published 
reports that he traveled to poland at least seven times in the 
1980s on visas issued by the polish consulate in tripoli libya 
however polish interior minister krzysztof kozlowski said 
thursday that tyminski did make the seven trips via libya between 
1980 and 1989 
tyminskis book is filled with military imagery portraying 
poland as a country under attack that must battle for its very 
existence especially against german economic dominance the first 
chapter is titled i put a weapon in your hand and the second 
is go to war 
tyminski until recently a political unknown who returned to 
poland in september after 21 years in canada and peru came from 
nowhere in a field of six to reach the second round of the 
countrys first popular presidential election he obtained 23 
percent of the votes sunday defeating prime minister tadeusz 
mazsowiecki 
the owner of several computer and communications companies 
tyminski leads the fringe libertarian party of canada and has 
polish peruvian and canadian citizenship 
his sharp criticism of alleged government mismanagement and his 
claims to economic expertise as a selfmade millionaire have struck 
a responsive chord especially among rural voters and the young 
the rapid rise of his campaign has startled solidarity leader 
walesa who is trying to decide how best to counter the outsiders 
unexpected success before the dec 9 runoff 
i can fight against any serious opponent and this man is an 
amateur i dont know how to react to it walesa said 
wednesday night 
walesa on thursday accused former communists of mounting a 
counterrevolution by supporting tyminski and said a tyminski 
victory could lead to something like a civil war 
in his book tyminski devotes a full chapter to the need for 
nuclear weapons in poland 
he says the bomb really should be called the zbomb 
most physicists who worked on the abomb were forced to leave 
germany by hitler due to racist policy that is why the a 
bomb really should be named the z bomb he said alluding to 
the word zyd polish for jew 
he said it isnt surprising that israel is one of the most 
prominent countries in production of nuclear arms of highest 
quality 
he writes the most effective weapon for poland is today an 
intelligent rocket of middle range equipped with a nuclear warhead 
of one megaton one megaton is the equivalent of 1 million tons 
of tnt 
he notes that the bomb that destroyed hiroshima in 1945 was only 
the equivalent of 13000 tons of tnt and it killed 130000 people 
the hbomb is so effective that it kills 10 million people at the 
small cost of 12 american cents for one human life he says 
poland a large flat country threatened with invasion for 
centuries also should possess this deterrent weapon he says 
let us hope it will never have to be used 
nuclear weapons he said are needed by us to prevent 
aggressive appetites and to secure our sovereignty so that we can 
work in peace and feel ourselves fully independent and equal to 
other free countries 
he says the weapon should not be possessed only by the 
superpowers and that once it is acquired by poland the countrys 
international prestige will rise 
to possess nuclear weapons is to find oneself in the club of 
enviable nations which enjoy significant international esteem 
tyminski writes 
his book is mainly a compilation of selfhelp recommendations 
and advice on how poland could benefit from business lessons 
learned in the west 
quoting mao tsetung and che guevera he devotes much time to 
saying that the country should adopt an aggressive and disciplined 
guerrilla business campaign including using private 
intelligence companies to discover gaps in western markets 
wake up poles he writes poles are not aware that today 
poland is the target of serious aggression the world has changed 
since world war ii and the worlds contemporary soldier is a man 
in a suit with a briefcase looking for economic possibilities of 
exploitation 
we shall either go to this war together or we will be 
destroyed and wiped off the map of europe

significant progress was made last year in 
getting polluters to assume a larger share of the cost of cleaning 
up toxic waste sites the environmental protection agency said 
thursday 
the problem remains enormous but epa administrator william 
reilly said we are making real progress addressing the worst 
problems at the worst sites 
polluters after negotiations with the government agreed in 
fiscal 1990 to commit 13 billion for cleanup under the superfund 
program the epa said that was about a 30 percent increase over 
fiscal 1989 
at the same time there were increases in the number of cases in 
which the epa sought reimbursements from polluters for past cleanup 
efforts paid by the government and in the number of administrative 
orders for cleanup activities 
reilly said the statistics for fiscal 1990 show significant 
cleanup activity at about a third of the toxic waste sites on the 
agencys priority cleanup list 
the priority list of toxic waste sites under the superfund 
program includes more than 1200 sites cleanup activities have 
been completed at only 63 sites with work under way at another 360 
sites according to epa figures 
officials estimate about 100 sites a year will be added to the 
list through the end of the decade 
the cost of cleaning up the sites on the current list has been 
estimated by the epa at more than 27 billion and is expected to 
take at least seven more years 
the superfund program which began 10 years ago so far has cost 
the government about 10 billion 
reilly said a more aggressive enforcement policy by the epa has 
prompted polluters to more easily agree to cleanup plans 
the epa said the agencys enforcement office won 285 settlements 
in fiscal 1990 in which polluters agreed to commit 13 billion for 
superfund cleanup efforts 
at the same time the epa took action in 79 cases to recover 
185 million from polluters for past cleanup activities paid for by 
the government 
meanwhile reilly said that the agencys overall enforcement 
activities involving water air and other pollution also increased 
in the fiscal year that ended oct 1 
during the year 65 criminal cases were referred to the justice 
department for prosecution and 100 individuals were formally 
charged with criminal violations of environmental laws 
both figures represented slight increases over the previous 
year but more than double the number of such cases in the 
mid1980s 
during the year however the number of criminal cases 
successfully prosecuted declined from 43 in fiscal 1989 to 32 last 
year and the number of defendants convicted declined from 72 to 
55 
officials said they could not explain the sharp drop but noted 
that some cases can take a long time to conclude

a coalition of 18 religious organizations 
urged the administration on thursday not to launch war against iraq 
and to let the united nations seek a diplomatic solution to the 
iraqi occupation of kuwait 
all us and other forces deployed in the persian gulf region 
should be placed under command of the united nations which should 
then seek a negotiated solution to the conflict between iraq and 
kuwait said a statement issued by the interreligious grouping 
the united states should not presume or accept the role of 
police in this conflict it said 
us military action not only wouldnt achieve president bushs 
goals of removing iraqi troops and restoring kuwaits legitimate 
government it would most probably kill more americans than are 
now hostages in iraq the statement said iraq is preventing some 
900 americans from leaving effectively holding them hostage 
an american attack would destroy kuwait rather than save it 
and would risk spreading the conflict to other parts of the 
volatile middle east the group warned 
it also condemned prejudice against arabamericans resulting 
from the administrations campaign against iraqi president saddam 
hussein this antiarab furor fuels american chauvinism and feeds 
racism on all levels the statement said 
the coalition includes american baptist churches usa the 
american friends service committee the evangelical lutheran church 
of america the national council of churches and the commission on 
social action of reform judaism

secretary of state james a baker iii 
today urged the security council to approve a resolution 
authorizing the use of force to drive iraq out of kuwait saying 
saddam hussein must realize time is running out 
if iraq does not reverse its course peacefully then other 
military measures including the use of force should be 
authorized baker said 
we must put the choice to saddam hussein in unmistakeable 
terms said baker who presided over the opening of the security 
council session 
after bakers brief speech kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh 
sabah alahmad aljaber denounced the wild beasts from iraq 
whom he said were pillaging and destroying his country and raping 
torturing and murdering his people 
he said the intransigence of the iraqi regime is pushing the 
region to a conflagration which we do not want but which appears 
to be the only avenue to restore our rights he accused iraq of 
using its hostages as bargaining chips to try to blackmail other 
nations into easing trade sanctions against baghdad 
the resolution expected to pass overwhelmingly would authorize 
an attack if iraqi troops do not withdraw by jan 15 diplomats 
say 
the only other time the security council has sanctioned force 
was to counter aggression during the korean war 
on wednesday night baker met with cubas foreign minister 
isidoro malmierca then with chinas top envoy qian qichen 
both countries have said they would not vote in favor of the 
measure although us officials say china was not expected to 
exercise the veto power it wields as one of five permanent security 
council members 
iraq today renewed its bitter criticism of the proposed 
resolution which the ruling party newspaper called a declaration 
of war 
president saddam hussein accused the united states of pushing 
the united nations into using double standrrds supporting 
resolutions against iraq but not those against israel 
the arab baath socialist party newspaper althawra suggested the 
resolution could provoke a backlash increased resistance by the 
oppressed 
in other gulfrelated developments 
a former navy secretary said today that president bush must not 
add to his error of ordering 430000 troops to the region by 
attacking iraq 
the presidents mistake in sending so many troops should not 
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature 
unprovoked ground offensive james webb told the senate armed 
services committee 
webb who served in the reagan administration is the third 
former top military official to urge caution in the gulf two 
former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff said wednesday bush 
should give sanctions against iraq more time to work before going 
to war 
i counsel patience war is not neat its not tidy its a 
mess said retired adm william crowe 
sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader said in a 
statement wednesday the chances were better than 5050 for a 
special congressional session on the gulf crisis probably before 
christmas 
the useofforce resolution remained on track after the united 
states presiding over the council this month delayed a vote 
wednesday on whether to deploy un observers to protect 
palestinians in israelioccupied lands 
seeking to maintain its alliance with arab countries opposing 
iraq washington wants to avoid having to veto or abstain in a vote 
that would offend israel 
us officials also wanted to pass the useofforce resolution 
before saturday when the council presidency passes to yemen which 
has sympathized with iraq 
the useofforce resolution is the 12th pertaining to the 
persian gulf crisis to be taken up by the security council since 
saddam husseins troops seized kuwait on aug 2 
bakers talk wednesday with malmierca was the first formal 
uscuban meeting in more than 30 years the two countries still 
lack formal relations 
it also meant baker has personally consulted all 14 other 
security council members at least 12 appeared solidly behind the 
resolution 
with nine votes needed to pass cuba yemen and china were the 
holdouts 
malmierca said after meeting with baker that he found the 
resolution not acceptable 
baker and qian refused to answer reporters questions when they 
got together at midnight wednesday at a new york hotel 
earlier in the day qian said he would not vote in favor of the 
useofforce resolution china had not said publicly before that 
how it would vote 
qians statement was widely viewed as a move to win political 
concessions from washington which imposed sanctions on china after 
its june 1989 military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
in a possibly related development the asian development bank 
today granted china a 50 million agricultural loan its first to 
the beijing government since the crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement 
the united states is a principal shareholder in the manilabased 
bank 
of the other permanent security council members the united 
states the soviet union china france and britain the soviets 
have just this week come out strongly behind the useofforce 
resolution 
either we will build civilized relations between states a new 
world order and new policy or will live by the law of the 
jungle foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told reporters on 
arriving in new york on wednesday

for the first time in more than a decade there are 
no women in the british cabinet emphasizing the abrupt end of the 
thatcher era and prompting angry reactions thursday from womens 
groups and some legislators 
to many accustomed to margaret thatcher being in charge prime 
minister john majors allmale lineup just seems strange 
it is extremely peculiar said caroline bullingham a 
27yearold psychology student we are so used to the main woman 
there and now no women at all 
the glaring absence of a female in the cabinet quickly became a 
target for the rival labor party with one labor legislator robert 
hughes asking whether the only woman in majors cabinet would be 
the backseat driver 
he referred to mrs thatcher majors mentor and the woman 
largely responsible for his political ascendence 
major defended the allmale appointments during his first 
appearance in the house of commons on thursday saying women were 
gaining a higher profile in law commerce civil service and 
politics 
and as those women would wish it to be they will reach the 
top on merit he said promising there would be women aplenty 
in his government 
if hughes had waited major added perhaps even to the end of 
today he may not have asked that question 
although major did not announce a female appointee at days end 
he did say that gillian shephard had been given a lowerranking 
executive job in the treasury 
mrs shephard who helped organize majors leadership campaign 
defended his appointments you will see women in the cabinet 
there will be women there she said in an interview on bbc 
television the men had better look out 
although feminists criticized mrs thatcher for appointing only 
one woman to the cabinet in 11 years her own position at the head 
of government was a beacon of what could be achieved 
the absence of even one woman in majors cabinet prompted 
squabbling between women legislators in majors own conservative 
party 
im hopping mad we want a seat at the top table complained 
teresa gorman a conservative lawmaker who threatened to organize 
protests at the house of commons 
every aspect of the economy and government has a bearing on 
women we dont want a few crumbs dropped from the table by the men 
any more mrs gorman said 
her criticism prompted a sharp rebuke from dame jill knight 
another tory lawmaker who accused mrs gorman in a statement of 
a stupid rocking of the boat the statement was signed by five 
other conservative women legislators 
not surprisingly labor party lawmakers were quick to issue 
criticism 
this shows mr majors contempt for women and his lack of 
recognition that women are half the population said jo 
richardson labors minister for women adding that his actions 
belied his words 
another labor legislator brian sedgemore said major had taken 
the party back to the 19th century after the way the tories 
treated mrs thatcher they have now shown what they really think 
of women politicians sedgemore told the londonbased daily 
telegraph 
but angela rumbold the home office minister responsible for 
womens issues and a former minister in mrs thatchers government 
defended the new prime minister 
were talking now about people getting places people 
getting in there because they are a woman no no they are there 
because they are the best people to do the job and thats the way 
they should be chosen she told bbc television 
there are 17 women among the 372 conservative legislators in the 
house and 43 women overall among parliaments 650 members 
only eight women have served in the cabinet starting in 1929 
with margaret bondfield barbara castle was appointed to the 
cabinet in 1964 and remained until 1976 she was replaced by 
shirley williams and since then women had served every year until 
the present newlyappointed cabinet

an israeli army officer accused by colombia of 
arming and training drug traffickers was convicted thursday by an 
israeli court of illegally exporting weapons and his military 
expertise 
the magistrates court convicted the reservist lt col yair 
klein of selling the arms to a group called the farmers 
organization he has denied any involvement with drug 
traffickers 
however the colombian government which has declared klein a 
fugitive may try him in absentia on charges he trained private 
armies for drug lords 
kleins case has prompted wide debate in israel over the 
practice of retired military officers working as mercenaries 
overseas 
thursdays conviction came after klein a former army 
counterterrorist expert agreed to change his plea to guilty on 
three charges against him and his company hod hahanit or 
spearhead 
klein pleaded guilty to negotiating to sell military expertise 
without a license the actual sale of expertise and the unlawful 
sale of equipment such as weapons belts and night gunscopes 
the charge said kleins dealings with the farmers organization 
were in april 1988 but gave no details on the group klein has 
maintained he believed he was hired by a ranchers organization to 
defend against leftist guerrillas 
klein who faces a maximum threeyear sentence refused to speak 
to reporters thursday 
its not as if e committed a murder or anything his lawyer 
yigal shapira said this is like a contractor who builds without 
a license we are talking about a two to five month suspended 
sentence 
a sentencing hearing has been set for december 27 
shapira read aloud a statement in kleins name before the court 
explaining why he changed his plea 
i decided to plead guilty in an effort to end the witch hunt 
that is being carried out in the press on the basis of rumors and 
speculation and which is causing damage to the state and myself 
israeli prosecutors are also considering charging klein in 
connection with an israeli arms shipment sent to the caribbean 
island of antigua that ended up with colombian drug lord gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha he was killed nearly a year ago in a gun battle 
with police 
klein has denied diverting those weapons to colombia he has 
said the shipment was intended for a training school he wanted to 
set up in antigua for panamanian rebels but that the shipment went 
awry 
kleins partner yizhak shoshani is also charged in connection 
with arms exports a hearing for him was postponed until next 
month

heres a dilemma how do you keep people 
from being frightened of an earthquake while trying to convince 
them one could occur at any time 
thats the quandary faced by emergency management specialists 
because of a projected major earthquake along the new madrid fault 
next week 
word of the projection has sent a wave of anxiety across much of 
the central united states scientists say the projection by new 
mexico climatologist iben browning is worthless yet they also say 
a damaging tremor along the quakeprone fault is likely to shake 
things up some day 
were trying to calm people down at the same time we dont 
want them so calm they forget about the longrange possibility of 
an earthquake said robert self a geologist with the university 
of tennesseemartin 
the cause of a great deal of nervous anticipation is brownings 
thery based on gravitational forces of the sun and moon he says 
theres a 5050 chance of a quake measuring 7 or more on the 
richter scale along the new madrid fault for the 48 hours either 
side of dec 3 
the fault running from marked tree ark to cairo ill and 
touching parts of missouri arkansas tennessee illinois and 
kentucky was the source of a series of severe quakes in the early 
19th century 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread damage in a populated region 
memphis is 35 miles from the fault and with 650000 people the 
largest city nearest the fault 
were trying to tell people theres nothing special about 
december 3rd but at the same time were trying to tell them to 
upgrade their building codes thats hard to do self said 
earthquake specialists at the us geological survey memphis 
state university and st louis university say browning is only 
guessing 
but other people arent taking chances schools around the 
region are planning to be closed primarily in small towns and 
rural areas communities are running disaster drills people are 
stocking up on bottled water and other supplies 
earthquake specialists put the chances of a damaging new madrid 
temblor at up to 60 percent over the next 15 years over the next 
50 years the chances climb to better than 95 percent 
such a quake likely would cause damage comparable to the temblor 
that hit the san francisco bay area last year 
the jitters reached into eastern ohio on thursday 
residents of lancaster near columbus said they felt a quake 
one seismologist said he found a blip to suggest it but no one 
could confirm that a tremor hit the region 
one caller to a radio station said the shaking knocked dishes 
over and pictures off the wall of her home others said they felt 
the earth move 
john minsch a geophysicist at the national earthquake 
information center in golden colo said his agency had no 
evidence to suggest an earthquake hit ohio 
as near as we can tell there was no activity there today 
he said almost anything could have caused the ground to shake 
construction a sonic boom

the leader of a west 
africanbacked interim government for liberia headed to that 
country thursday optimistic that a newly signed ceasefire will 
end the 11monthold civil war 
the interim leader amos sawyer brushed aside rebel leader 
charles taylors refusal to accept his administration 
the truce is a big step forward and im optimistic sawyer 
said before he boarded a helicopter belonging to a west african 
regional force sent to end the war which has left at least 10000 
dead 
if the ceasefire holds it provides the opportunity to reach 
the necessary political solution he said 
sawyer was picked as president in august by a conference of 
liberian exiles but others among the 200000 liberian refugees in 
sierra leone were less optimistic about the ceasefire that taylor 
signed with two other warring parties at a summit of west african 
leaders wednesday in bamako mali 
taylor lost my support and that of many liberians when he 
started killing innocent civilians they are all killers 
said liberian refugee lucy shaw a midwife 
sawyers foreign minister gabriel bacchus matthews 
acknowledged that many problems loom he said the truce is a 
small step on a 1000mile journey to peace 
despite the signing matthews said taylor had refused to discuss 
putting the ceasefire into effect and agreed only to another 
meeting within an hour of signing the accord taylor told 
reporters he did not recognize sawyers administration 
taylor has set himself up as president of a rival interim 
government and he wants to organize liberian elections sawyer 
rejects taylors plan 
the bamako summit was convened by the 16nation economic 
community of west african states which authorized the deployment 
in liberia of 8000 soldiers from five member nations 
taylor may not have accepted our government but all the west 
africans including his chief supporters burkina faso and ivory 
coast have and that is significant sawyer said 
he predicted taylor will continue to try to find a solution 
rather than be confrontational 
in august taylor refused to join president samuel doe and 
breakaway rebel leader prince johnson in a ceasefire in 
september johnsons men captured and killed doe but taylor 
continued fighting johnson and the west african force 
under the west african plan sawyer and his vice president 
lutheran bishop ronald diggs are not permitted to run in elections 
scheduled for next year 
taylor invaded liberia from ivory coast on dec 23 and quickly 
won over thousands of peasants who took up arms to help him 
overthrow doe long accused of corruption and brutal repression 
however the rebellion degenerated into a tribal conflict 
pitting fighters loyal to doe taylor and johnson against each 
other

more than 40 years after moscow tried to starve 
west berlin into submission germany said thursday it would help 
ward off hunger in the soviet union by donating huge food reserves 
built up because of the infamous blockade 
a daily airlift of supplies and tens of thousands of food 
packages sent by care the international relief organization will 
also aid the crippled communist nation as part of a largescale 
assistance program 
the situation in the country is catastrophic people have to 
fight for food people already are going hungry the zdf 
television network said in a campaign for private donations 
although germans routinely rush to the aid of victims of natural 
disasters and other emergencies the current wave of support is 
unprecedented 
companies are contributing goods and services german businesses 
and ordinary citizens pledged more than 4 million in donations 
during a 45minute telethon on zdf the network said late thursday 
newspapers are running their own donation campaigns and the 
money is still flowing to various organizations 
a heart for russia were taking part read the headline 
thursday in the masscirculation bild newspaper below the headline 
were pictures of prominent germans explaining their reasons for 
contributing money to the bild campaign 
the state of lower saxony pledged help totaling 5 million 
while the maltese aid organization said it was sending field 
kitchens to cook meals for needy ukrainians 
even before the latest actions germany had promised the soviets 
195 billion in financial aid this year alone 
pictures of food being loaded for the soviet union are daily 
fare in the german news media 
in public german officials have been playing on the nations 
gratitude for the soviet approval of german unification as well as 
humanitarian motives 
please help relieve the need in the soviet union this is a 
work of charity and of good neighborliness chancellor helmut 
kohl said in an appeal broadcast late wednesday on zdf television 
kohl also called to mind the soviets role in clearing the way 
for the merger of east germany and west germany on oct 3 
we all have to thank the soviet union in these months i am 
certain that we all are ready to help said kohl who met with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev earlier this month in 
germany 
even then gorbachev had been reduced from the leader of a once 
monolithic superpower to an imperiled leader in need of a rich 
western patron 
while german politicians are not saying so directly their 
support for the current relief efforts might be aimed at propping 
up gorbachev as his country faces a possibly decisive winter 
germany has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants refugees and other newcomers the germans are eager to 
prevent another wave of newcomers this time soviets fleeing 
hunger and civil strife at home 
thursday there was a nearly nonstop stream of announcements of 
relief efforts that could amount to germanys largest humanitarian 
program ever 
in bonn kohls top foreign policy adviser horst teltschik said 
germany would give the soviets the socalled berlin reserves 
replenished over the years in case of another blockade 
those reserves include among other items 66000 tons of rye 
26000 tons of canned meat and 7500 tons of butter berlin 
officials who urged bonn to donate the food estimate it could 
feed 10 million soviets for one month 
a huge usled airlift broke the 194849 soviet blockade aimed 
at bringing west berlin to its knees and driving out the western 
powers 
germans are worried however that their donations could wind up 
in the soviet unions growing black market 
we are supervising things ourselves said klaus noeldner 
head of the german branch of care 
we will be distributing with the help of citizens committees 
in schools noeldner said we are distributing only to 
individuals those who because they are too old or handicapped or 
weak cant stand on line 
he estimated that 12 million people in moscow alone fall into 
that category noeldner says the organization already has enough 
money to send 60000 care packages 
care packages are a part of german history and have become 
nearly legendary after millions of the americansent boxes filled 
with food helped save germans from starvation after world war ii 
also thursday an aeroflot transport plane filled with 37 tons 
of food left northern hanover bound for moscow the plane is part 
of a relief airlift that organizers say will fly daily to the 
soviet union

president saddam hussein said thursday that 
americans have been duped by rambo movies into thinking war will be 
easy but iraq has weapons to beat even the most advanced us 
systems such as the stealth bomber 
speaking in a defiant tone saddam said the united states is 
wrong if it thinks iraq will tremble over the un security council 
sanctioning the use of military force to dislodge iraq from kuwait 
he said his armed forces had the technology to defeat even the 
most sophisticated american weapons systems specifically citing 
the stealth fighter bomber 
there have been conflicting reports over whether iraq has the 
ability to detect the stealth fighters which are designed to sneak 
in under enemy radar some reports have said the iraqis may have 
acquired the means for detection by using technology sold by 
france 
the pentagon has sent 22 f117a stealth aircraft to unspecified 
bases in the region 
in his remarks carried by baghdad radio the president also 
lashed out at the ruling family in saudi arabia saying they are 
not fit to be the guardians of holy islamic shrines 
the remarks addressed to an arab youth solidarity seminar came 
hours before the security council was to vote on the ussponsored 
resolution authorizing the use of force to oust iraqi forces from 
kuwait if they do not withdraw by jan 15 
diplomats in baghdad said they believed the speech was aimed 
largely at lifting the morale of the iraqi people many of whom 
have been concerned over the un resolution 
the speech was not accorded special status by the official iraqi 
news agency which summarized it in a few hundred words major 
speeches are carried verbatim 
referring to earlier un resolutions condemning the occupation 
of kuwait and demanding iraqi withdrawal saddam said the united 
nations is trying to foist on iraq unjust and rejected 
resolutions 
he said that by passing another resolution authorizing military 
action they believe that we will be scared and that we will call 
on others to help us 
but saddam said we will fight and fight on in a way which 
will make all arabs and moslems proud 
in the speech saddam referred to the socalled un 
security council and said it has become a tool of the united 
states 
i am sorry to say that it is no longer a security council but 
an obedient instrument to be used by those who dictate its 
resolutions he said 
he added that while iraq respected the american military might 
the situation in the persian gulf should not be viewed as a war 
movie that ends with a quick victory 
the americans are still influenced by rambo movies but this 
is not a rambo movie this is something different saddam said 
we do not underestimate american military power but we scorn 
their evil intentions 
saddam added that the iraqi military had the ability to fight 
hightech american weapons saying we are not deprived of 
military technology we can see the stealth very clearly and 
we hope the us will not be dragged into using it because we 
will shoot it down like any hostile warplane 
saddam also attacked the saudi royal family saying how dare 
they call thearab peninsula after their grandfather saud 
forgetting that this land has a long history they consider the 
holy land as the feudal possession in full disregard to its people 
and history 
saddam reiterated his position that all middle eastern conflicts 
should be resolved simultaneously including the 
israelipalestinian dispute 
in a statement earlier thursday saddam accused the united 
states of forcing the united nations into adopting a double 
standard by supporting resolutions condemning iraq but not those on 
israel 
the iraqi government has insisted it would abide by un 
resolutions on the gulf only if the united nations enforced those 
calling on israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied in 
the 1967 middle east war 
the united states and its allies have rejected the linkage

the first year they tried it their 
wheelchairs got stuck in the mud 
but after 18 seasons the states special deer hunt for 
paraplegic sportsmen is a smooth operation with all the camaraderie 
and thrills of more conventional quests for the whitetailed 
quarry organizers say 
male bonding is that what you call it joked tom early an 
18year veteran of the states division of fisheries and wildlife 
and a regular on the special hunts held before the official season 
opens 
weve had a couple of people that were really down in the 
dumps until they got involved in the hunt it perks them up it 
gives them something to look forward to said leo daly a 
wildlife official and hunt leader 
even those who arent too excited at the prospect of hunting 
approve 
i think its a good opportunity for people with disabilities 
to get out in the woods said massachusetts rehabilitation 
commissioner elmer bartels i always hoped that they were lousy 
shots 
for hunter fred marchegiani 100 percent disabled since 
suffering a nerve disease in 1980 the adventure in the berkshires 
offers a rare chance to revisit the old days 
to be able to hunt again and be in the outdoors and enjoy 
something that ive done all my life actually it gives you a new 
lease on life he said thursday 
overall 10 deer were taken by the 26 hunters who attended the 
3day hunt earlier this month 
thats more than in the early years daly said 
when we first put them in the woods they couldnt do anything 
they were stuck in the ruts he said game wardens devised a 
plywood platform to use as a base 
participants range from people who have jobs and are normally 
active to people who have very limited mobility and rarely go 
outside at all early said 
some of the regulars hunted before becoming disabled but others 
have never hunted 
a lot of them are on the verge of being sick all the time 
anyway they come out of the hospital to go hunting and they go 
back in the hospitals afterward we try to be as careful as we 
can early said 
the hunt is a lowprofile affair 
we cant handle a lot more people than we have because its 
pretty labor intensive early said 
we have fourwheel drive vehicles and get them as close as we 
can and then youve got to wheel them through the woods he said 
the hunters are given permission by private landowners to hunt 
property that has high deer density early said 
its nothing to see 40 pair of eyes out there in the 
morning said daly who noted that some of the landowners are not 
hunters themselves but are willing to open their property to allow 
the hunt and to keep the population manageable 
hunting from a wheelchair is not always a disadvantage 
often sitting there and not being able to move can be an 
advantage in that youre not scaring deer early said 
early and daly said no one has been injured during a hunt but 
some of the hunters have circulation problems and must be brought 
in if it gets rainy and cold volunteers and state wildlife 
officials monitor hunters through binoculars 
benefits from the hunt arent just oneway said volunteer shaun 
smith who has been going on the hunt for 15 years but was uneasy 
at first about working with the disabled 
i found out that theyre regular people he said

president bush on thursday signed a massive 
revamp of the nations immigration law that increases the number of 
people allowed to immigrate and strikes down exclusion of entry on 
the basis of sexual orientation and political views 
bush hailed the first major overhaul of immigration law since 
1965 as a complementary blending of our tradition of family 
reunification with increased immigration of skilled individuals to 
meet our economic needs 
it changes the 1950sera immigration ban against communists and 
homosexuals but would still allow the secretary of state 
discretion to bar legal status to those considered to be terrorist 
or foreign policy threats 
the bill will increase overall immigration from 540000 in 1989 
to 700000 people a year for each of the next three years and 
stabilize the annual total at 675000 after that 
the bills threeyear total of 21 million visas for permanent 
residence is up from 17 million in the previous threeyear period 
the changes bush signed into law were hailed by irish and other 
european immigrant interests who stand to benefit from the 
increase gay groups filipino veterans and salvadorans fleeing 
their wartorn country 
the provisions of the new law emphasize reuniting separated 
families with immigrants sponsored by family members increasing to 
520000 per year through 1994 and at least 480000 a year 
thereafter 
the bill will also 
allow more people to immigrate on the basis of desirable 
employment skills reserving 140000 visas a year for immigrants 
with special skills up from 54000 in the past 
give special status to wealthy investors setting aside 10000 
visas for those with at least 500000 to invest in businesses that 
create new jobs 
eliminate the automatic exclusion of aids sufferers from legal 
status the legislation leaves it up to the health and human 
services department to decide whether to list aids as an excludable 
disease 
earmark 40000 visas a year for individuals from italy 
poland ireland and other countries virtually shut off from 
immigration in the last 20 years because priority was given to 
people with family here most of whom were from asian and latin 
countries 
reserves at least 16000 of those 40000 visas a year for 
irish immigrants making ireland the only country with a guaranteed 
number of visas 
grant a special temporary protected status until july 1992 
for salvadorans for several years salvadorans fleeing domestic 
violence including from rightwing death squads have waged an 
uphill struggle against deportation 
allow for naturalization of filipinos who served in the us 
military or philippine army or guerrilla units in world war ii 
expedite deportation of aliens convicted of criminal activity 
and grant general arrest authority to the immigration and 
naturalization service 
ease restrictions on visitors once barred for communist or 
ideological viewpoints 
this bill is good for families good for business good for 
crime fighting and ood for america bush said at a white house 
signing ceremony on thursday 
bush said the bill revises the exclusion grounds for the first 
time since enactment in 1952 putting end to the kind of political 
litmus test that might have excluded even some of the heroes of the 
eastern european revolution of 1989 
the american bar association praised the bill but voiced 
opposition to some provisions that it said would impede the 
ability of persons in immigration proceedings to secure 
representation and could block some political asylum applicants 
georgetown university law professor david cole said the bill 
leaves too many loopholes for exclusion on political and 
ideological grounds because of the discretion left to the 
secretary of state in areas of terrorism and national security 
concerns 
far from repudiating the ideological litmus test congress 
merely adjusted it to todays paranoias he said 
the national gay and lesbian task force praised the bill for 
permitting homosexuals to immigrate but also called on the bush 
administration to use its newly granted powers to keep aids and hiv 
infection off the list of excludable diseases 
bush and hhs secretary louis sullivan have not taken official 
positions but administration officials said it is expected they 
will not put the disease on the list 
the law improves the prospects of citizenship for thousands of 
illegal irish immigrants living in boston new york and other 
cities 
this historic legislation is good news for ireland and the 
irish people irish foreign minister gerard collins said in 
dublin thursday 
under an earlier amnesty law a large number of permanent visas 
will be given to mexicans already here illegally

president reagan and his top aides tried to 
mislead the tower commission and cover up white house involvement 
in a key aspect of the irancontra affair former us sen john 
tower says 
in his soontobepublished memoirs tower said he was shocked 
when reagan denied the white house gave advance approval for an 
august 1985 shipment of missiles to iran in contradiction of an 
earlier statement by the former president 
portions of towers book consequences a personal and 
political memoir were published in thursdays dallas times 
herald the book is scheduled to be published in february the 
newspaper said 
the longtime republican lawmaker wrote that reagans aboutface 
seemed part of a deliberate effort to cover up thenwhite house 
chief of staff donald regans involvement in the affair 
tower was appointed by the reagan administration in 1986 to 
investigate the scandal 
the tower commissions report had noted reagans shifting 
stories about the missile sale but the book marks the first time a 
principal figure has suggested the changes in the presidents story 
were part of a deliberate coverup 
in a jan 26 1987 meeting with the tower board reagan said 
that sometime in august 1986 he approved a shipment of arms by 
israel to iran in a meeting with the commission two weeks later 
reagan said that he and regan had gone over the matter a number of 
times and that regan had a firm recollection that the president had 
not authorized the august shipment in advance 
the president said he didnt recall authorizing the august 
shipment either then on feb 20 1987 the president wrote the 
board a letter changing his story again in the letter he said he 
simply couldnt recall whether he approved the august shipment in 
advance or not 
tower also said reagan offered to appoint him ambassador to west 
germany when he retired from the senate in 1984 but he declined 
the offer 
tower also wrote that he sent his wife and children into hiding 
on fbi advice when anger against texas conservatives grew after 
president kennedys 1963 assassination in dallas

the newly appointed chief of columbia 
presbyterian medical center resigned abruptly after questions were 
raised about his spending in office the hospital said thursday 
michael bradleys departure as president and chief executive 
officer of the financially troubled hospital came amid reports that 
he exercised bad judgment in his use of a 250000 discretionary 
fund 
bradley who came to columbia presbyterian in august from 
philadelphias thomas jefferson university hospital submitted his 
resignation wednesday said spokeswoman susan parker 
it resulted from policy differences with the board of 
trustees concerning certain hospital expenditures totaling less 
than 100000 the board said in a statement in accepting his 
resignation the hospitals board did not call into question 
bradleys overall management capability 
bradley was unavailable for comment his secretary said 
a source close to the hospital who spoke on condition of 
anonymity confirmed published reports that bradley had spent 
25000 on china for a hospital dining room and 60000 stocking a 
wine cellar for entertaining potential donors 
there was no wrongdoing but there was a question of 
judgment the source said 
bradley was hired to turn around the struggling hospital the 
largest in the city with about 1200 beds 
he had a good reputation in financial management circles 
said kenneth raske president of the greater new york hospital 
association raske said bradleys resignation was a surprise 
bradleys predecessor thomas q morris resigned in may after a 
dispute over the hospitals financial woes and inability to staff 
its new allen pavilion hospital

the stakes were never higher war or 
peace and while its far too early to know how the showdown will 
play out secretary of state james a baker iii can take credit for 
succeeding in very difficult diplomacy over iraqs occupation of 
kuwait 
baker rounded up the votes for the us resolution to threaten 
iraq with force by lobbying all 14 other members of the un 
security council he made two long trips abroad and then in an 
11thhour drive held eight separate meetings with foreign 
ministers in new york in advance of the vote 
baker apparently cut no private deals but he gave some ground 
on the palestinian issue we should be willing at all times to 
confront the problems that exist 
however he rejected an effort by the palestine liberation 
organization to link iraqs invasion of kuwait with arab demands on 
israel 
the plo had tried to seize on the crisis in the persian gulf to 
make some headway of its own with support from yemen the only 
arab country on the council and a few other sympathizers 
bakers main task was to make sure the soviet union china 
france and britain all permament members of the council would not 
block the resolution with a veto 
britain and france have joined the united states in committing 
troops to defend saudi arabia and were never in doubt they have 
stood alongside the bush administration from the outset although 
french president francois mitterrand preferred putting more 
emphasis on diplomacy 
china played an ambiguous game 
baker met with foreign minister qian qichen twice in cairo 
earlier in the month and then in new york at midnight wednesday 
the chinese are skeptical about using force to liberate kuwait 
but baker solicited a pledge not to block the resolution 
after making his pitch he told reporters i didnt detect a 
whole lot of expressions of unhappiness with the resolution 
a pokerfaced politician who helped lift his old texas 
countryclub buddy george bush to the presidency baker has never 
run a graver risk than the threat to go to war over kuwait if iraq 
does not pull out by jan 15 
after the aug 2 iraqi invasion bakers skills were put to a 
slightly different test his task was to assemble the odd alliance 
that has confronted iraq at the united nations and in the gulf 
itself 
this brought together such disparate elements as syria still 
branded by the state department as a sponsor of terrorism the 
saudi monarchy western democracies and the ousted kuwaiti regime 
baker even tried to enlist cuba to at least support the 
resolution but in the first formal highlevel uscuban meeting 
in more than 30 years foreign minister isodoro malmierca told 
baker the resolution was unacceptable 
the question now is what next 
douglas hurd the british foreign secretary said the united 
nations had sent iraqi president saddam hussein a clear message 
we are making a strong bid for peace on the basis of him 
withdrawing cutting away all the confusion hurd said there 
is a period of time during which he has the peaceful options in his 
hands 
and yet hurd said of the jan 15 deadline its not 
indefinite 
standing defiantly within range of iraqi missiles on 
thanksgiving president bush acknowledged the dangers as he told 
us troops in saudi arabia 
no one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic 
weapons or exactly whom theyt may be aimed at down the road but we 
do know this for sure he has never possessed a weapon that he 
didnt use 
in the meantime baker and the administration have had the kind 
of break that any political operative relishes falling into his 
lap 
the soviet union after insisting for months that diplomacy 
should be given more time now has turned on saddam with a fury 
matching bushs 
incensed that baghdad has trapped more than 3000 soviet 
citizens in iraq president mikhail s gorbachev demanded on monday 
that saddam withdraw from kuwait and free foreign hostages 
the fate of iraq is in the hands of its leadership he said 
time is running out 
until gorbachev leveled the threat at iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz in moscow the soviets were very cautious about 
threatening to use force 
but the caution gorbachev and his foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze showed in their meetings with baker now has given way 
to unqualified support for the bush administration 
shifting the deadline from jan 1 to jan 15 represents a slight 
concession to the soviets and others hesitant to threaten iraq with 
all necessary means it also gives us troops more time they 
need to get ready to fight 
the additional two weeks could make a difference only if saddam 
were to do a 180degree turn and obey the resolutions he has 
ignored since the invasion 
since baker already has repeatedly rejected partial 
solutions there may be no facesaving way out for iraq 
the hand held by bush and baker will have been called

president bush on thursday signed updated 
legislation to help the homeless authorizing 2 billion for 
programs that incorporate housing with health and counseling 
services 
the bill bush said in a statement recognizes that the 
homeless often have needs that go beyond housing assistance 
by providing health services substance abuse services and 
counseling in addition to housing assistance this act enhances the 
administrations ability to address the needs of the homeless in 
all their complexity he said 
the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance amendments act 
authorizes 993 million for the 1991 fiscal year and 11 billion 
in 1992 
the money will pay for such things as the shelter care plus 
program which links rental housing assistance to other support 
systems for the homeless including treatment for mental illness 
and programs for drug abusers 
the legislation also authorizes the health and human services 
department to establish centers offering services for the homeless 
and those people in danger of becoming homeless

regulators are moving to close a loophole that 
threatened to allow savings and loans to evade some of the changes 
in last years thrift bailout law 
the board of the federal deposit insurance corp voted 50 to 
ask for public comment on a regulation that would prevent sampls from 
avoiding certain restrictions by becoming statechartered savings 
banks 
if given final approval the rule likely would become effective 
in about two months office of thrift supervision director timothy 
ryan vowed to block sampl conversions until then 
state savings banks common in northeastern states and the 
pacific northwest are hybrid institutions a cross between a 
commercial bank and a savings and loan 
depending on the state many have retained broad investment 
powers including the right to buy junk bonds and in some 
instances own subsidiaries engaging in activities normally 
considered too risky for banks such as commercial real estate 
speculation 
since passage of the sampl law in august 1989 theres been a 
growing movement by sampls to change their status to state savings 
banks nineteen states have passed or are considering laws 
permitting sampl conversions 
the industry argues that sampls trying to convert are doing so not 
to evade last years law but to avoid the expensive examination 
fees imposed by ryans agency 
the proposed rules would prohibit sampls that convert to savings 
banks from investing in junk bonds or from using federally insured 
deposits to finance highrisk subsidiaries it would also sharply 
limit the amount they are allowed to lend to a single borrower 
however converted institutions would not have to abide by rules 
requiring sampls to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing 
if the rule goes through it would be one more factor forcing the 
end of savings and loans as a separately regulated industry 
savings banks are overseen by bank agencies rather than sampl 
agencies 
at this time the fdic board is not proposing to extend the junk 
bond and other restrictions to the 400 state savings banks already 
in existence however the agencys staff said it was studying that 
idea 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke who oversees 
nationallychartered commercial banks and is a member of the fdic 
board said activities that pose a threat in converted sampls 
logically should pose a threat in existing state savings banks 
it seems to me it would be better if we had all of these 
institutions similarly limited he said 
ryan who sits on the fdic board also favors extending the 
restrictions 
this proposed regulation is a good effective first step he 
said

a drug called ghb which is gaining popularity 
among illicit users has sickened people in at least nine states 
federal health officials said thursday 
the centers for disease control began surveying poisoning from 
gamma hydroxy butyrate or ghb in august after san francisco 
officials reported a series of poisonings resulting from use of the 
drug 
ghb is illegal for use in the united states except in 
governmentsanctioned research said dr steven auerbach a medical 
epidemiologist at the cdcs center for environmental health and 
injury control 
but he said it has become popular among illicit users in the 
last few months because it produces a trancelike state it also 
has been sought by bodybuilders for weight control and as a sleep 
aid 
the drug has turned up in the atlanta area in a cocktail 
mixed with amphetamines and called max auerbach said 
the atlantabased agency has received reports of ailments 
include vomiting drowsiness seizures and loss of consciousness 
after people ingested ghb twentyfive reports came from 
california 15 from georgia seven from florida three from south 
carolina two each from minnesota and arizona and one each from 
ohio texas and virginia 
in most cases the individuals dissolved up to three teaspoons 
of ghb in water and drank the mixture among the reported cases 11 
people were hospitalized but there have been no deaths the cdc 
said 
the bottomline takehome message is if a product is 
being marketed for having a pharmacological effect it is acting as 
a drug and any and all drugs are going to have some side effects 
auerbach said 
auerbach said he did not know how people were getting ghb 
though some body builders apparently got it through mailorder 
advertisements in fitness magazines 
the drug has a relatively simple molecular structure you 
dont need to be a fancy pharmaceutical company to make it i could 
see how somebody could make it on a smaller scale he said 
the food and drug administration issued a warning earlier this 
month that ghb used outside certain approved situations such as in 
narcolepsy research is illicit and must stop 
ghb sales also have been banned in california and florida

a union brought suit thursday to block 
enforcement of a new ethics law it contends unconstitutionally bars 
federal workers from being paid for writing articles or giving 
speeches unrelated to their jobs 
the lawsuit will test the scope of provisions set to take effect 
jan 1 that were intended to prevent highlevel officials from 
being paid to write articles or make speeches by individuals or 
companies that do business with the government 
the suit filed in federal court here by the national treasury 
employees union seeks a declaration that the honoraria ban 
unconstitutionally bars federal workers from being paid for 
writings speeches or appearances unrelated to their jobs 
the ethics law stopped the gravy train for members of congress 
but it also derailed ordinary enterprising federal workers from 
using their right to free speech to make an honest buck on their 
own time and in totally nongovernment related ways said robert 
m tobias president of the union representing 140000 federal 
workers 
joining in the suit is a parttime internal revenue service 
worker who earns outside income writing articles about camping and 
the environment for such popular magazines as womans day sierra 
and camping today 
jan adams grant who is employed as a seasonal employee of the 
irs service center in ogden utah also earns money for giving 
speeches about earthquake preparedness to local church groups 
according tothe complaint 
another irs employee named in the complaint thomas c fishell 
is an ordained minister who earns money performing weddings 
funerals and delivering sermons in churches near his home in 
garland texas 
the new honoraria ban which was enacted by congress as part of 
the ethics in government act of 1989 bans government employees 
from accepting a payment of money or anything of value for an 
appearance speech or article 
it eliminated honoraria for house members and sharply curtailed 
it for senators 
we have members who do freelance work who have written 
articles on matters that have nothing to do with their jobs that 
are now being penalized by this law said gregory oduden the 
unions chief lawyer 
grant a lowincome tax examining assistant earned nearly 
3000 last year from her outside writings and appearances she 
counts on this added income oduden said 
donald campbell the deputy director of the office of government 
ethics said the agency has advised government employees that the 
new honoraria ban applies to all speeches articles or appearances 
i think the language and so forth and what congress passed is 
rather clear he said they didnt make a distinction in the 
act as between highlevel and lowlevel employees so i dont think 
they have given us the opportunity to make a distinction

president mikhail s gorbachev on thursday 
pronounced himself and other communists guilty before the working 
class in a candid admission of blame for the countrys worsening 
economy and political paralysis 
he told nearly 1000 delegates to the 28th moscow city communist 
party conference that the soviet union faced increasing 
difficulties with food supplies ethnic conflicts crime and a 
battle of laws that has led to a paralysis of power 
the reasons gorbachev said were errors in the actions of 
central organs above all in the central committee of the communist 
party and including the actions of the general secretary and 
president 
gorbachev 59 is both the countrys president and 
generalsecretary of the 18millionmember party 
in his hourlong speech he promised immediate steps to increase 
food supplies reiterated his determination to hold the restive 
republics together and urged the delegates to keep the common man 
in mind 
he said failure by the party leadership to address workers 
concerns was responsible for its defeat in recent elections around 
the country 
we are guilty before the working class i think all of us 
and i personally take responsibility he said 
but gorbachev told the delegates earlier thursday he had no 
intention of quitting as party leader he also said he was firmly 
for maintaining the partys dominance in society 
standing on a podium near an 8foot bust of lenin he spoke 
confidently and extemporaneously occasionally referring to 
handwritten notes taken while listening to seven hours of earlier 
debate at the conference 
the speech appeared aimed at disarming his critics led by 
russian federation president boris n yeltsin by accepting a 
measure of blame while vigorously asserting that the party is on 
the road to renewal and can solve the countrys problems 
a poll published thursday in the government newspaper izvestia 
indicated the number of people who fully trust the party fell 
from 27 percent in december 1989 to 14 percent in july izvestia 
gave no details on the polling 
gorbachev and yeltsin differ on how to go about achieving a 
market economy and yeltsins russian parliament claims the right 
to pass laws superseding national ones 
nearly all of the 15 soviet republics have taken similar steps 
toward autonomy several have stopped shipping food outside their 
borders aggravating the shortages in major cities 
gorbachev announced that agreements were reached wednesday with 
the republics of estonia kazakhstan and the ukraine to send dairy 
products to moscow and leningrad where milk has all but 
disappeared from stores this month 
he also said the countrys two largest cities would receive 
first priority for food purchased or donated abroad and indicated 
that powdered milk would be taken out of storage and distributed to 
the people 
some delegates jeered when he said supplies of key nondairy 
products meat bread and vegetables have remained the same or 
risen since last year in moscow 
then why isnt there anything in the stores one man 
shouted 
quiet down gorbachev replied summaries from moscow and 
leningrad are on my desk every day 
answering delegates written questions the soviet president 
reiterated his desire for a political solution to the persian gulf 
crisis but he also toughened his position calling for military 
pressure to force iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw his 
troops from kuwait 
everything must be done including military pressure 
pressure i am using that word exactly to force the hussein 
regime to understand that the annexation must be halted 
gorbachev defended his frequent trips abroad and took some 
credit for ending the cold war 
he said that when he assumed power in 1985 people were 
saying we are willing to endure anything mikhail sergeyevich if 
only there is no war 
now he said no one remembers that and whats more theyve 
decided that gorbachev travels abroad too much and say enough 
of this travel its time to take care of our own problems at 
home 
pointing at the delegates as if to shame them gorbachev said 
the criticism was actually testimony to how far the nation has come 
in improving relations with the west 
its the best praise possible he said

a 3yearold law has failed to keep us 
fishing boats under american ownership because of the way the coast 
guard interprets the legislation a congressional report said on 
thursday 
the general accounting office report also suggested that 
congress may wish to consider changes to the antireflagging 
act 
the act was passed in 1987 to establish more stringent 
requirements for making a vessel legally under american control and 
thus eligible for the priority given us fishermen and vessels on 
fish quotas within the 200mile territorial limit 
under previous law the requirements could be met even though a 
companys stock was totally owned by foreigners 
the 1987 act required that the controlling interest in the 
vessel as measured by a majority of voting stock be owned by us 
citizens 
it also laid down a number of new requirements but contained 
several grandfather clauses to protect the financial interests of 
owners who had become involved in us fisheries under the previous 
law 
the coast guard has interpreted these grandfather exemptions to 
apply to the vessel not its owner several us fishing and 
shipbuilding groups have challenged this interpretation in a 
lawsuit pending in us district court in washington 
the gao said the coast guards interpretation means that the 
vessel can be bought and sold repeatedly without losing fishery 
privileges regardless of whether the new owner is a corporation 
with totally foreignowned voting stock or other arrangements that 
offer potential for foreign control 
it said an estimated 29000 usbuilt vessels were licensed for 
catching fish at the time the act was passed in 1987 and nearly all 
of them could probably be grandfathered by virtue of past fishing 
within the 200mile limit 
the gao added however that the acts prohibitions against 
foreign rebuilding are likely to have a significant effect 
it said some of the vessels participating in the groundfish 
industry off the coast of alaska were apparently rebuilt under the 
grandfather exemptions but no more such rebuilding seems likely 
the antireflagging acts american control provisions have had 
little impact on ensuring that us fishery operations are 
controlled by us citizens the gao said 
this is a result of the coast guards interpretation allowing 
the grandfather exemption to remain with a vessel even if the 
vessel is subsequently sold to a foreignowned company 
consequently should the congress desire another result it may 
wish to consider changes to the existing legislation

us secretary of state james a baker iii 
took advantage of his un visit for thursdays antiiraqi vote to 
clear up a small administrative matter 1857 million in late 
dues 
his check for that amount substantially reduced what the united 
states owes the united nations where washington has turned 
repeatedly for international backing in its stand against iraq 
beginning in 1985 the united states withheld much of its un 
dues to protest what it called antiwestern bias inefficiency and 
budget overruns 
including overdue peacekeeping payments us arrears grew to 
nearly 1 billion before president ronald reagan decided in 1988 
that the united nations had made sufficient progress on reforms to 
resume full funding 
reagan left the details of paying the arrears to president bush 
his successor 
with thursdays check us officials cut their un dues debt 
to 2962 million that still amounts to about 72 percent of the 
arrears owed by all 159 member nations 
the us government now plans to pay its full un assessment 
each year this year that amounts to 2336 million onefourth of 
the regular un budget bush and baker also want total us 
arrears repaid over a fiveyear period

saying a rebel offensive in chad is growing french 
officials thursday ordered 150 more troops to that north african 
country but said they wont join the fighting 
chads government contends the rebels are backed by libya a 
view endorsed this week by the us state department however 
france has described the 3weekold war as an internal conflict 
between chadians and libya denies backing the rebels 
a french foreign ministry spokesman said thursday that the 
situation is worsening and the battles are more severe he said 
the rebel offensive has grown in size and government forces are 
encountering difficulties on the ground 
other french sources said rebel leader idriss debys forces are 
moving steadily westward away from the border with sudan and 
toward the chadian capital ndjamena 
the french defense ministry said a 150member company of the 
second foreign parachutist regiment of the foreign legionnaires 
would be sent to ndjamena the move is aimed at bettering the 
security of our troops and assuring if need be the protection of 
our nationals 
there are an estimated 1250 french civilians in chad a former 
french colony 
france already had 1000 troops in chad it recently shifted a 
company from ndjamena to the northeastern town of abeche near the 
main combat zone 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said france is studying 
requests from chad for arms but he did not say what the response 
would be its clear the chadian army could have substantial 
needs he said without elaborating 
however he also said french policy is to refrain from defending 
even friendly governments from internal opposition 
france has said that president hissene habres troops suffered 
considerable losses in the recent fighting the two sides have 
claimed to take and retake several eastern towns but neither has 
offered casualty figures 
habre visited the war zone last week and according to some 
accounts narrowly escaped the hands of the rebels however habre 
was seen on chad tv wednesday welcoming a foreign dignitary to 
ndjamena 
deby helped habre take power in 1982 and formerly served as a 
military adviser to the president but he fled in april 1989 amid 
allegations he helped plot a coup 
france sent thousands of troops to chad in february 1986 at the 
height of fighting in the north against libyanbacked rebels libya 
at that time occupied the northern part of the poor landlocked 
country but it was chased out in a series of battles in 1987 
the us state department on wednesday said the new battles 
represent the latest example of libyas ongoing efforts to 
destabilize legitimate governments 
during the recent tensions libya has accused the united states 
of premeditated hostile intentions

the prosecutor in the central park jogger trial 
on thursday rejected defense arguments that two teenage defendants 
were arrested because they were black 
if you look objectively and rationally at the evidence the 
defendants will be found guilty assistant district attorney 
elizabeth lederer said 
the teenagers were arrested not because of their race but 
because they participated in a violent outburst of destruction 
that left the woman near death in a wooded area of the park ms 
lederer said 
the trial is the second stemming from the april 19 1989 
attack kharey wise 18 and kevin richardson 16 are charged with

year 
the case was expected to go to the jury after ms lederer 
finishes her closing statement friday 
defense attorneys colin moore and howard diller told the jury 
wednesday their clients were charged because they were black and 
because police needed suspects 
black and hispanic suspects were swept up and accused by police 
anxious to resolve the case moore said 
ms lederer said the charges of racism were an insult to jurors 
intelligence 
the 30yearold jogger who testified during the trial has 
recovered from most of her injuries and has returned to work as an 
investment banker she has said she still suffers vision and 
balance problems and lost her sense of smell

president bush blaming the nations economic 
slowdown in part on iraqs invasion of kuwait told a group of bank 
officials on thursday that any recession will be a short one 
i am confident that it will run its course bush said 
he defined it as the slowdown or the recession or whatever 
one would call exactly what were in now 
at the same time bush expressed disappointment that interest 
rates had not come down further in response to enactment of a 
bipartisan fiveyear 500 billion package of tax increases and 
spending cuts 
interest rates frankly are higher than any of us would like 
them to be bush said adding that he didnt want to be seen as 
a fed basher or anything of that nature 
he said he was glad the fed helped to nudge rates down a bit 
following passage of the plan which he conceded was not the 
worlds most popular piece of legislation 
and he said he hopes the agreement will eventually lead to even 
lower rates 
speaking to the association of bank holding companies bush said 
that oil price increases in the aftermath of the fourmonthlong 
iraqi occupation of kuwait were battering the economies of both 
large and small nations 
and its very clear that they are having a very bad effect on 
our economy he said 
bush renewed his determination to prevail in the iraqi 
confrontation and said theres an economic side to this equation 
and economic effects are devastating those who can afford it the 
least 
as he has done in the past bush sidestepped the issue of 
whether the nations economy has already slipped into a recession 
i suspect that each one of you here has economists that you 
believe in some are saying recession and some saying downturn 
but one positive thing is that most if not all people are 
suggesting that whatever it is it wont be long lasting and i 
think that is very important to the overall good of the american 
people 
bush told the bankers that he hoped a bank law overhaul package 
his administration will unveil in january would provide 
significant structural reform to help banks be more 
competitive 
in the age of the atm automatic teller machine and the 800 
number and in the face of intense competition from nonbanks to 
meet the consumers credit needs we must rethink and reexamine 
our existing regulations bush said 
the legislation we will propose will maee a significant 
contribution to the longterm health of the banking system bush 
said 
he said that he would propose a variety of measures including 
provisions on deposit insurance 
treasury officials have said that among other possible changes 
they are considering restricting depositors to no more than three 
federally insured accounts 
currently there are no limits on the number of different 
accounts that an individual may maintain while up to 100000 in 
each account is insured 
whats at stake is not just the confidence of the american 
people in the banking system but the profitability and 
competitiveness of a key industry bush said

a former navy secretary from the reagan 
administration joined the parade of former military officials 
attacking president bushs persian gulf buildup thursday bush 
focused on the un resolution authorizing force against iraq 
calling it a move closer to peace 
bush and house speaker thomas foley both expressed opposition to 
the idea of calling congress back for a special session to address 
the gulf crisis 
the president met with house leaders while keeping an eye on the 
united nations saying he hoped security council approval of the 
resolution would send perhaps the strongest signal of all to 
saddam hussein 
asked if the vote authorizing attack if iraqi troops dont 
leave kuwait by midjanuary made a shooting war more likely bush 
said i hope were closer to peace and that this will drive home 
the point to him that hes got to get out of kuwait 
earlier in an interview with the spanish language network 
univision bush 
said he preferred not bringing congress back for a special 
session but wanted to sound out congressional leaders more fully 
foley dwash and minority leader robert michel rill had 
lunch with bush and foley said afterward i hope the president 
doesnt call back the 101st congress reports of that may be 
premature 
meanwhile vice president dan quayle took a swipe at critics who 
have said bush has moved too quickly in the gulf and have advised 
against an outright attack 
does patience today risk greater american casualties 
tomorrow quayle asked in a speech at seton hall university in 
new jersey with every day that passes the plight of the 
people of kuwait grows more and more desperate he said is 
this a moral course of action 
hearings on the gulf crisis continued on capitol hill with 
criticism dominating in testimony before the armed services 
committee of sen sam nunn dga 
the presidents mistake in sending so many troops should not 
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature 
unprovoked ground offensive said former navy secretary james 
webb 
the presidents decision to send 200000 troops to saudi arabia 
earlier this month in addition to the more than 240000 deployed 
after the invasion caused democrats to question whether the united 
states is careening toward war 
every single witness weve had here with differing views on 
other things all of them have felt weve overdeployed nunn 
said almost all witnesses have said it tends to drive you to a 
olicy whether or not youre ready for that policy 
webb told the panel that if bush decides to use military force 
to drive iraq from kuwait he should call for an immediate 
resumption of the draft and then for a declaration of war by the 
congress 
he also recommended that the united states reduce the size of 
its gulf force and call on the allies to commit a representative 
number of troops 
i worry about the shape of the new world order webb said 
the united states is becoming the weapon of choice 
bush in the univision interview said the allvolunteer army is 
as strong as it can be and he had no intention of trying to 
reinstitute a military draft to help deal with the crisis 
richard perle who served in the reagan administration as 
assistant secretary of defense told the senate committee he did 
not believe united nations sanctions against iraq would work and 
bring saddam hussein to his knees 
perle said an american defeat in the gulf would do serious 
damage to the nation 
their testimony came one day after two former chairmen of the 
joint chiefs of staff urged bush to give the sanctions a year to 18 
months to work before opting for war 
bush in remarks to a banking group said iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait touched off an increase in oil prices that is rocking the 
economies of many countries 
it is clear to me that those who can afford it the least are 
those who are getting hurt the worst by the speculation that has 
resulted in these higher oil prices bush said he added that 
price rises are having a very bad effect on the us economy 
which many private economists say has slipped into recession 
as for a special session republicans led by senate minority 
leader bob dole have urged such a move as a way to support bush 
but the white house says bush needs no congressional resolution 
to authorize the use of force against saddam and has shown no 
inclination to call a special session 
and rep william broomfield rmich senior republican on the 
house foreign affairs committee said airing all of our 
differences at this time in an official session of congress would 
give heart to saddam hussein and doubts to our allies 
sen edward kennedy dmass endorsed a special session 
recommending that congress approve a resolution authorizing force 
after aug 2 1991 thus giving the sanctions one year to work 
the united nations cannot decide when america goes to war 
only congress and the administration can make that decision for our 
country said kennedy a member of the senate armed services 
committee 
the un security council resolution authorizes a military 
strike to liberate kuwait if iraq refuses to withdraw from the 
emirate by jan 15

the galileo spacecraft racing toward a 
close encounter with earth next week so it can reach jupiter in 
1995 will explore its home planet like an alien world scientists 
said thursday 
the camerabearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to 
approach earth from space so the dec 8 flyby will be our first 
chance to look at earth as we have at other planets in the solar 
system torrence johnson galileos chief scientist said during 
a news conference 
it gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as 
theyve never seen it before bill oneil galileo project 
manager at nasas jet propulsion laboratory said earlier 
galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever 
built it was launched from space shuttle atlantis on oct 18 
1989 starting its 14 billion 24 billionmile journey to 
jupiter the solar systems largest planet 
starting in december 1995 the galileo orbiter will spend two 
years exploring jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe 
that will make measurements in jupiters atmosphere until it is 
crushed by intense pressure there 
galileos route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could 
use venus and earth as gravity slingshots to expand its orbit 
around the sun and reach jupiter it will use earth for that 
purpose dec 8 and again in december 1992 it used venus as a 
gravity slingshot last february 
scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to 
make pictures and measurements of venus and earth data collected 
at venus was stored on galileos tape recorder and sent to earth 
last week 
galileos optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost 
layer of venus sulfuric acid clouds as did spacecraft that 
visited venus previously but galileos infrared camera made the 
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph 
winds in venus middle and lower cloud decks 
severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was 
detected in the middle cloud layer nasa scientist robert carlson 
said 
studying venus acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere 
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels 
in earths atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in 
a greenhouse said arizona astronomer michael belton 
galileo also discovered remarkably fast highenergy particles 
flowing away from venus a surprise because space around the planet 
was thought to be placid said university of iowa physicist louis 
frank 
the spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds 
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that 
sweep around venus scientists played the tape thursday 
galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest atlantic 
ocean at 335 pm est dec 8 galileo was 446 million miles from 
earth on thursday 
the spacecraft will measure gases that cause greenhouse 
effect warming of earths atmosphere and study highaltitude 
water vapor that helps create and destroy earths protective ozone 
layer johnson said 
galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern 
instruments to study the far side of the moon which is always 
pointed away from earth he added

stormie jones the worlds first heartliver 
transplant recipient was remembered thursday as a determined 
teenager who shunned publicity and wanted more than anything to be 
normal 
transplant pioneer dr thomas starzl who said he would shift 
his efforts to research because he was emotionally drained by 
stormies death remembered the white settlement texas girl at a 
monthly memorial service at the childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
along with 19 other children who died recently 
stormie received her historic transplant at the hospital feb 
14 1984 at the age of 6 she received a second liver transplant 
in february and died of sudden heart rejection nov 11 
she was the beautiful st valentines day card of feb 14 
1984 the 6yearold godsent child with a name that movie starlets 
must have envied a smile which no one who saw it could ever 
forget starzl told about 50 people gathered in the hospital 
auditorium 
hospital spokeswoman sue cardillo said stormie overcame so 
many major obstacles that she just almost began to seem invincible 
to me the unfortunate thing is thats not based on reality 
doctors said more medical breakthroughs may be needed to offer 
patients like stormie the promise of a long and vigorous life 
with current techniques of immunosuppression its not 
possible to project out to 10 or 15 years yet it awaits to be seen 
if we can transfer the very good shortterm and intermediate 
results into longterm survival said dr james kirklin chairman 
of the heart committee of the united network for organ sharing in 
richmond va 
kirklin said the problem inherent in multiorgan transplants is 
finding the right levels of antirejection medication which vary 
with each patient and with each transplanted organ 
for instance kidneys and hearts require lower doses of 
antirejection medication than do livers said dr byers shaw 
chief of the liver transplant program at the university of 
nebraska shaw worked with stormie while in pittsburgh 
the real challenge in multiorgan transplantation is to 
continue to evolve our understanding of the proper combination of 
therapy that will allow both organs to survive and prevent 
infectious complications kirklin said 
starzl said stormies life was a glorious one and triumphant 
because her case revealed the livers role in metabolizing 
cholesterol 
we wanted more for her than this but it was not to be he

the discovery of two giant dinosaurs in wyoming is 
reigniting debate over why the huge beasts became extinct 
colorado paleontologist robert bakker who led the team that 
found the dinosaur remains said thursday the discoveries reinforce 
his theory that dinosaurs became extinct gradually 
a scientist at the smithsonian institution who supports the 
theory that dinosaurs met their end suddenly in a cosmic 
collision says the latest finds prove nothing of the sort 
the extinction of dinosaurs is a big area of controversy right 
now in science said dr richard stucky paleontologist at the 
denver museum of natural history 
scientists offer dozens of theories about the mysterious mass 
extinctions including a change in the earths motion famine 
parasites poisons climatic changes meteorites and even 
extraterrestrial hunters 
the debate is on again since bakkers team of university of 
colorado scientists unearthed a 70footlong 25foothigh 
haplocanthosaurus a member of the cetiosaur or whale dinosaur 
family the carlin giant found near mcfadden wyo was the 
largest cetiosaur ever located bakker said 
the second find is the only brontosaurus scientists have placed 
in the cretaceous period which began 135 million years ago 
before that discovery near rock river wyo in a fossil 
deposit known as breakfast bench no brontosaur had been found that 
was less than 137 million years old 
bakker announced the discoveries wednesday the remains were 
found last summer 
the fossil record clearly indicates that these mass 
extinctions were not the result of a saturday night of cosmic 
mayhem bakker said the last remains of different dinosaur 
families are strewn through millions of years of rock he said 
nicholaus hotton a curator of paleobiology at the smithsonian 
institution disagrees he still subscribes to a collision theory 
which he said is evidenced by iridiumrich sediments in the 
deposits marking the end of the cretaceous period iridium is a 
heavy metal found in platinum ores 
the crustal rocks in the top kilometers of the earth are very 
poor in iridium but meteors and things are very rich in iridium 
so why do you find that in that zone hotton said 
the argument is that they were brought in from the outside 
an asteroid comet or one hell of a big meteorite that struck the 
earth and in doing so it disrupted the ecology he said 
bakker believes extensive migration and subsequent disease 
epidemics may have wiped out dinosaurs he said hotton is missing 
the frog facts 
if a comet or asteroid hit the earth and killed all the 
dinosaurs how then were the deaths so selective he asked the 
fact is that the little delicate animals like frogs survived 
and the large aggressive animals didnt 
according to bakker dinosaurs became extinct because of 
worldwide diseases 
dinosaurs didnt go out with a bang they went out with 
worldwide diarrhea he said 
the cetiosaur bones eventually will be displayed at the 
university of wyoming and at north carolina state university which 
assisted the fieldwork the brontosaurus is still being unearthed

a planeload of food arrived in moscow thursday in 
the first shipment by german charities aimed at easing the chaotic 
food situation in the soviet union 
the planeload of 25000 prepackaged meals was being sent to 
childrens hospitals and orphanages said valeria kuprina deputy 
chairman of the moscow branch of the soviet childrens fund 
she said food deliveries to the childrens institutions are 
becoming irregular so officials decided the first shipment of 
western food should go to them rather than the barren shops 
in the face of widespread worries that the foreign food 
shipments might be stolen or simply stalled and left to rot the 
childrens fund made highly unusual arrangements for supplies to be 
delivered to the institutions within hours of landing at the 
airport 
trucks quickly met the aeroflot cargo flight and delivered the 
food packages immediately ms kuprina said 
a vanload of food arrived after 11 pm at a childrens home in 
western moscow but there was no joyous welcome the kids were all 
asleep 
the food was to be distributed friday to the 150 children aged 
4 to 18 at childrens boarding home no 24 director tatiana 
vyedyokhina said the home has been receiving supplies from its 
regular domestic sources but that she worried about the future 
the situation in moscow is getting worse and worse she said 
in a latenight interview i think it will affect the childrens 
home eventually 
despite the start of aid from west europe that is just beginning 
to arrive in moscow the supply situation is unlikely to change 
rapidly for most soviet shoppers 
the same day the german supplies arrived blearyeyed shoppers 
were trundling between empty metal food cages at the gastronom 
store across from the kiev railroad station in moscow 
thirty people slumped dejectedly in line in a supermarket that 
by 7 pm contained only lemonade tiny red apples five fancy 
cakes and a counter full of mix for homebrewed kvas a type of 
beer 
the line woke up when a clerk appeared with a shopping cart 
containing unrecognizable cuts of mutton within moments the clerk 
was screaming 
ill just throw it out and you can grab the one you want 
she shouted tossing plastic packages of bony meat at the crowd and 
dashing back to sanctuary 
fearing everworsening shortages and rising prices consumers 
are snapping up every item within minutes of its arrival on shop 
shelves 
western officials want assurances that the outpouring of aid now 
making its way to the soviet union is properly used 
horst teltschik a top aide to german chancellor helmut kohl 
said wednesday that president mikhail s gorbachev had promised to 
allow germans to accompany their shipments all the way to their 
destinations 
across the globe individuals charities and governments were 
rushing to send supplies the german government planned to ship 
huge food reserves collected as a safeguard against a repeat of the 
soviet blockade of berlin in 1948 ordinary germans pledged 27 
million on a telethon 
an italian group planned to send 90 tons of food and medicine 
japan said it would provide hundreds of millions of dollars in 
medical supplies 
soviet officials say the country actually has no less food than 
last year but the distribution system is collapsing as the country 
lurches toward a market economy 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh blamed in 
part disorganizing forces in the country 
in my opinion they represent different political forces but 
they think that it is necessary to make the situation very grave in 
the country from a political point of view for them it is very 
convenient and necessary 
many soviets are convinced the countrys problems are the result 
of deliberate sabotage by communist party bureaucrats who fear 
losing their power and privileges 
asked whether the west is overreacting to the shortages 
gremitskikh said common people would like to help 
we do not view this as alms this is an expression of 
solidarity and sympathy and we cannot reject it to the contrary i 
think that we should receive everything gratefully

the rate of death and debilitating strokes from 
blood vessels that burst in the brain can be significantly reduced 
by immediate surgery and boosting patients blood pressure 
researchers said thursday 
a study at loyola university medical center found the twopart 
treatment reduced stroke risk for patients with burst brain 
aneurysms which are bubblelike weak points in the brains blood 
vessels 
the study was published in novembers neurosurgery the journal 
of the american association of neurological surgeons 
dr jack p whisnant a neurological specialist not connected to 
the study said elements of the treatment have been used for some 
time but hadnt been tried together and should be studied further 
an estimated 5 million americans have brain aneurysms and about 
28000 a year suffer ruptures about half of those suffering 
ruptures die within the first month after a vessel bursts said 
whisnant chairman of the mayo clinics health sciences research 
department 
the loyola researchers estimated about a third of patients with 
burst aneurysms suffer serious strokes as a result 
in their study of 43 patients with burst aneurysms two died and 
two others suffered strokes according to the report issued six 
months after the study ended 
we initially found that early surgery for an aneurysm 
minimized the risk of further bleeding but did nothing to prevent 
a patient from later suffering a stroke loyola neurosurgeon dr 
thomas origitano the studys lead author said in a telephone 
interview on thursday 
that early surgery consists of clipping the aneurysm by 
shutting off the leaking blood vessel 
early surgery was critical to the twopart treatments success 
the researchers said 
some neurosurgeons traditionally have waited seven to 10 days to 
operate after a patients aneurysm bursts to see if circulation 
will stabilize in the brain origitano said 
apart from early surgery loyola researchers diluted patients 
blood by removing red cells allowing better circulation within the 
brain they said they then pumped extra blood into the patients to 
increase blood pressure 
quicker surgery and blood pressure treatment stabilizes the 
brains blood supply sooner and helps avert strokes origitano 
said 
aneurysm patients run a high risk of stroke for two weeks after 
a rupture because the brains blood vessels fail to regulate 
circulation that allows pressure to drop and deprives the brain of 
blood said dr o howard reichman chief neurosurgeon at loyola 
if the blood flow falls below a critical threshold a stroke 
can occur reichman said 
of the 43 people in the 2year loyola study 30 were operated 
on within two days of arrival at a hospital eight others were 
operated on within a week five could not undergo surgery because 
of unrelated medical conditions the researchers said 
whisnant said elements of the approach taken at loyola are 
commonly used but not as a comprehensive treatment diluting the 
blood has been tried but not necessarily in conjunction with quick 
surgery and increasing blood pressure he said 
he called the loyola report interesting but said a larger study 
is needed to determine the success of the approach

a company that beamed hardcore pornographic 
movies via satellite to home television viewers pleaded guilty to a 
federal obscenity charge and agreed to pay a 150000 fine the 
justice department said thursday 
home dish only satellite networks inc which once beamed such 
movies as hard core girlfriends and rambohh sex platoon to 
30000 subscribers to its american exxxtasy channel entered the 
guilty plea in federal court in buffalo ny 
the company agreed to pay 150000 in fines and its operators 
paul l klein and jeffrey younger promised to forever refrain from 
promoting or distributing sexually explicit films or publications 
hdos guilty plea marked the first prosecution under a 1988 law 
that bars distribution of obscene material by cable or subscription 
television 
until investigators pulled the plug on the operation last march 
hdo was the only nationwide satellite network beaming hardcore 
pornography to home television viewers the justice department 
said 
the movies were transmitted from the companys buffalo office to 
a satellite uplink station operated by us satellite inc in salt 
lake city that relayed them to the gte spacenet corp satellite 
the justice department said 
in buffalo the company pleaded guilty to one felony count of 
transmitting an obscene promotional movie hot shorts on feb 
25 1990 from buffalo it also agreed to plead guilty to a separate 
felony charge in salt lake city utah of transmitting the movie 
hardcore girlfriends the next day 
the hot shorts promotional films were beamed in the early 
evening to owners of satellite dish receivers to advertise the 
explicit nature of the films available from american exxxtasy the 
department said 
the proliferation of cable and satellite dish technology has 
made it necessary for the congress and the department of justice to 
act to prevent the pollution of the public airwaves with hardcore 
pornography attorney general dick thornburgh said in a 
statement 
us satellite was not prosecuted because it cooperated with the 
investigation and shut down the transmissions last march said dee 
v benson the us attorney in utah 
last month hdo pleaded guilty to a state obscenity charge in 
montgomery ala and was fined 5000 
klein younger and two other hdo officials were also indicted in 
alabama but new york gov mario cuomo last june refused to honor 
alabamas request for their extradition 
federal prosecutors decided not to charge klein and younger 
individually because of their willingness to stay out of the 
business and cooperate with the justice departments investigation 
of the pornography industry benson said 
the company agreed to turn over its inventory of pornographic 
movies for destruction by the government 
klein and younger will be questioned about where they obtained 
the films to help federal prosecutors identify the producers of 
obscene movies said patrick a trueman head of the justice 
departments child exploitation and obscenity section 
we would like information about where they are getting the 
movies from trueman said prosecutors expect to question the two 
about the companies they dealt with as well as the individuals 
who sold them the movies trueman said

sentencing of a retired cia agent on charges 
stemming from the irancontra affair was postponed thursday at the 
request of a defense attorney angry about a letter the prosecution 
wrote to the judge 
thoas g clines 62 faced up to 16 years in prison and a 1 
million fine for underreporting to the internal revenue service the 
money he made selling weapons to the nicaraguan rebels 
his attorney paula junghans asked for a sentencing delay so 
she could respond to a prosecution letter containing serious and 
incorrect allegations that her client lied to a probation 
officer 
us district judge norman p ramsey postponed sentencing until 
dec 13 i think its utterly silly but you got your week 
he said 
neither prosecutors led by stuart abrams nor junghans would 
discuss the letters contents ramsey said from the bench the 
letter indicated that clines told the probation officer his 
financial status had undergone a remarkable decline 
clines was convicted sept 18 on two charges of failure to 
report profits of at least 203431 in 1985 and 57009 in 1986 
he also was found guilty of not telling us tax collectors 
about overseas financial accounts and failing to file tax forms 
required for them 
during a 10day trial prosecutors characterized clines as a 
sophisticated businessman who set up dummy foreign corporations to 
hide his dealings from the irs 
defense attorneys argued that clines from middleburg va 
misunderstood how to report his earnings and was unfamiliar with 
irs regulations that require foreign accounts to be reported 
junghans said clines was a victim of selective government 
prosecution she accused independent counsel lawrence e walsh of 
going after clines for political reasons 
walshs office and irs agents spent three years tracing the 
irancontra money trail 
clines testfired bought and arranged shipments of rifles 
machines guns grenades and explosives to the contra rebels at a 
time such shipments were outlawed by congress 
witnesses testified that clines was in the arms business with 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord and his business 
partner albert hakim the three shared some of their profits with 
canadian arms dealer emanuel weigensberg 
the operation was directed by former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and retired marine lt col oliver l north 
the prosecution is seeking an unspecified prison term and fine 
against clines 
so far eight people and one corporation have either been found 
guilty or pleaded guilty to crimes arising out of the irancontra 
affair

consultations with president zhelyu zhelev and other political 
leaders 
the socialist premier blamed for the balkan countrys political

not only in the interest of society but also in the interest of my 
socialist party he said that he will continue his work as a 
parliamentary deputy

many basic consumer items are either rationed or unavailable the

immediate change of government is indispensible for the formation 
of a new national government for the peaceful transition to 
democracy 
it said leaders also agreed that they will draft the outlines of 
a further accord to define the status of political parties protect 
people from political persecution and formulate a social program 
and the rights of ethnic minorities

bulgarias 9 million people were on strike public transport in 
sofia and plovdiv had stopped work creating chaos in the streets 
of bulgarias two largest cities 
many intersections in the capital were blocked thursday by angry 
citizens who had built barricades with benches garbage cans and 
large concrete planters

crotononhudson ny ap the discovery of zebra mussels in 
the brackish waters of the hudson river startled scientists who 
said thursday the pests werent supposed to get this far south this 
soon 
weve just thrown the book out now avery klauber a 
spokesman for new york sea grant at the state university of new 
york in stony brook theres no way of knowing how far and how 
fast theyre going to travel 
experts didnt expect the tiny mussel named for its striped 
shell to appear in the hudson until next year or the year after 
scientists also had hoped the waters of the lower hudson with a 
salinity of eight parts per thousand would be too salty for the 
mussels 
they have been spreading through the great lakes since 1988 
when scientists think european ships released them with ballast 
water 
the mussels have few natural predators and breed rapidly 
causing problems for industries power plants public water systems 
and boaters by clogging water intakes they can also wreak havoc on 
aquatic food chains 
federal officials have estimated that control of the mussels 
could cost as much as 5 billion over the next decade in the great 
lakes region 
the hudson river discovery is the first north american sighting 
of the pest outside the great lakes drainage basin said charles 
oneill supervisor of the new york zebra mussel information 
clearinghouse at the state university of new york at brockport 
everybody was watching to see where theyd turn up out of the 
great lakes oneill said this one being such a jump opens up 
the possibility that the mussels can be really widely scattered 
the animals were discovered by accident on a piece of wood 
collected for an museum exhibit from haverstraw bay about 25 miles 
north of new york city oneill said adding it was too early to 
tell the extent of the infestation 
he said the mussels may have been brought to the river by a 
great lakes pleasure boat or a european ship or even by a piece of 
wood floating from the erie canal to the mohawk river and on into 
the hudson 
the discovery of the mussels is particularly worrisome to 
officials of four major power plants near the discovery site 
oneill said 
experts expect zebra mussels eventually to find their way into 
the mississippi river through canals connecting it to the great 
lakes from there they could spread across the united states 
were looking at a critter that within the next couple 
generations could very possibly be found throughout north 
america oneill said 
in washington sen daniel p moynihan dny issued a plea to 
president bush thursday to sign legislation authorizing 60 million 
for project grants and research funding to control the mussels

prosecutors have decided against filing 
charges in the death of an elderly woman whose head was cut off and 
frozen by a laboratory hoping to give her a second chance at life 
questions raised about dora kents death led to an investigation 
by prosecutors but they found nothing to take to court 
we evaluated all the evidence there was and there simply 
wasnt enough for us to prosecute assistant district attorney 
don inskeep said wednesday 
dora kent was 83 and ailing when her son saul kent a devotee 
of cryonics moved her from a convalescent home to the alcor life 
extension foundation laboratory here 
cryonics is the practice of freezing the dead to preserve them 
for possible future resuscitation such as when a cure for the 
ailment that caused their death is found many scientists discount 
cryonics as fantasy 
alcor officials say they severed mrs kents head after she died 
of pneumonia dec 11 1987 their hope was that scientific advances 
would one day make it possible attach her head to a healthy body 
the coroners office decided to investigate the death because 
mrs kent died without a doctor present 
coroner raymond carrillo found mrs kent died of a lethal dose 
of barbiturates and ruled her death a homicide he then asked the 
district attorneys office to investigate 
alcor officials said the drug nembutol was administered after 
her death to preserve brain cells 
alcor research director mike darwin called the end of the 
investigation a wonderful christmas present that is long 
overdue

commanders of the antiiraqi multinational force 
ordered their troops on alert for the first time thursday a 
british news agency reported but a saudi official denied his 
countrys forces had made such a move 
asked about the british report pentagon spokesman pete williams 
in washington declined comment saying its a matter of policy not 
to discuss alert status of troops worldwide however another 
source speaking on condition of anonymity denied us forces are 
on heightened alert 
the british news agency quoted unidentified military sources as 
saying an unspecified movement of iraqi forces triggered the alert 
its report said the alert stems from fears of an iraqi air 
attack in retaliation for thursdays un revolution authorizing 
use of force unless iraq withdraws from kuwait by jan 15 
the defense ministry in london refused immediate comment on the 
report by the press associations defense correspondent

alert one stage down from full alert 
we are on alert for an attack from the air maj peter 
cross chiefofstaff at a british base at the port of al jubayl

missiles and aircraft and the likelihood of this is perceived as 
being higher today than previously

biological and chemical protective suits and respirators at all 
times 
saudi forces have been on alert since august when iraq invaded 
kuwait said a saudi official on condition of anonymity

an andean summit that listed a common 
market and antidrug trafficking efforts at the top of its agenda 
brought together the presidents of venezuela colombia peru 
ecuador and bolivia on thursday 
president bushs initiative of the americas to create a 
hemispherewide zone for free trade within north and south america 
will also be discussed during the two days of meetings opening 
thursday 
president jaime paz zamora of bolivia is host of the summit 
attended by presidents cesar gaviria of colombia carlos andres 
perez of venezuela alberto fujimori of peru and rodrigo borja of 
ecuador 
our principal proposition during this historical summit is the 
creation of a common and free market in the region paz zamora 
said 
it is the fourth such summit since the andean pact came into 
being in 1988 la paz is 13000 feet up in the andean mountains 
the government has provided emergency oxygen equipment should 
visiting dignitaries be affected by the rarefied air 
at a news conference shortly after arriving here gaviria called 
for democratic elections in cuba 
i would be pleased if cuba became a full member of the 
international community through the implementation in cuba of a 
democratic electoral system gaviria said 
we respect the self determination of nations and in that sense 
we respect the cuban system but i hope that they enter a 
democratic electoral system 
the fight against cocaine trafficking in the region is expected 
to a prime topic in the presidential talks peru and bolivia 
produce 80 percent of the coca leaf that forms the basis of 
cocaine colombia is the worlds largest processor of cocaine 
peru has rejected involving the military in the antidrug 
battle bolivia has agreed that the military can take part 
fujimori and paz zamora were expected to emphasize alternative 
economic development for coca farmers both believe farmers must be 
provided with other sources of income to wean them from coca leaf 
cultivation 
gaviria told reporters in la paz he is interested in having 
colombian drug traffickers tried in colombia instead of other 
nations 
we are working to strengthen the colombian judicial system and 
to complement that reinforcement we would like criminals tried in 
colombia and not in other nations he said we are putting this 
into practice with the support of the international community 
he said this new mechanism was being used first in the cases 
of lesser criminals 
regarding trade plans are under way to create a common andean 
market by 1992 although ecuador has opposed such a plan another 
obstacle is that member nations maintain protectionist duties on 
hundreds of products and controls on the import and export of 
certain products 
bolivias planning minister enrique garcia said the 
fundamental principle for andean integration has to be consistent 
with free market economic policies that regional economies are on 
the road to implementing it is not possible to maintain subsidies 
or protections of any type

the department of energy has cracked down 
on the manager of the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant after 
significant procurement violations were found an internal memo 
showed 
the violations turned up during a doe survey before thanksgiving 
that showed four major subcontractors at the plant were working 
without contracts according to a copy of the memo obtained by the 
associated press 
the plant is the only one in the united states that makes 
plutonium detonators for nuclear weapons plutonium processing at 
the plant has been shut down since last december because of safety 
problems 
on orders from doe acting plant manager jim zane issued the 
memo to his assistant general managers saying it is imperative 
that egampgrocky flats inc initiate a more disciplined and 
organized approach to the acquisition needs of rfp rocky flats 
plant 
zane ordered his managers to immediately cease personally 
contacting subcontractors and directing them to report to this site 
or to perform any services procurement policies must be followed 
if not such subcontractors will be denied site access and ordered 
to stop work 
zane did not immediately return a telephone call thursday 
seeking additional comment 
francis allhoff the plants assistant general manager for 
support operations confirmed thursday that the doe ordered egampg to 
halt improper subcontracting practices and said egampg has issued 
stop work orders for the contractors about 170 workers have been 
barred from the site until they get proper contracts he said 
the doe took exception and i think rightly so to the way we 
were handling certain procurement vehicles allhoff said these 
practices do not constitute really good management control 
beth brainard a doe spokeswoman at the plant said thursday 
that the four subcontractors were doing work based on previous 
contracts she said plant operations did not suffer because of 
egampgs lack of legal contracts 
she said egampg officials were two months behind in getting 
approval for their budget which began in october and have been 
preoccupied with other problems 
the companies working without contracts were identified as nus 
corp of gaithersburg md tenera advanced services of knoxville 
tenn cygna energy services of walnut creek calif and stone amp 
webster engineering corp of boston allhoff said he did not know 
how much the contracts were worth 
rob robinson a spokesman for stone and webster said the 
company had a contract for work at the plant but funds ran out 
all i know is that efforts are being made to get us back on as 
soon as possible possibly as early as next week robinson said 
he said workers were ordered to stop work on projects ranging 
from planning and scheduling to engineering to restart the plant 
spokesmen for the other companies did not immediately return 
calls thursday 
doe officials said the order to clean up subcontracting work was 
delivered at a meeting held with defense contractors from around 
the nation to try to resolve problems interfering with efforts to 
restart the plant 
plutonium processing at the plant located 16 miles northeast of 
denver will not resume until the facility is deemed safe the doe 
has said 
the doe sharply criticized the egampg last month when a report by 
cermack fletcher and associates cited significant management 
failures at the plant 
zane replaced phil warner as plant manager after the report 
became public but plant officials said the management shakeup 
wasnt related to the report

gov norm bangerter announced thursday 
that he wont seek a third term and a republican party leader said 
the decision would mean a freeforall in utah politics in 1992 
bangerter shocked friends and foes alike when he announced he 
would retire from politics after 18 years in state office when his 
current term ends 
someone once told me that politics is dependent on a 
neverending supply of people who dont know what theyre in for 
after six years i know too well bangerter said at a hastily 
arranged news conference at the capitol 
by dropping out of the political picture so early the governor 
has set the stage for the most wide open election year any of us 
can remember said state gop chairman richard snelgrove 
it will be a freeforall he said 
if sen jake garn rutah decides not to seek reelection in 
1992 the states most popular politicians would be forced to 
choose which office to seek 
the announcement buoyed democrats hopes of occupying the 
statehouse after an eightyear absence 
we have momentum going our way but we cant forget were 
still a minority party said state democratic party chairman 
peter billings jr 
at the news conference bangerter 57 said the rigors of public 
office have interfered with his role as a father and grandfather 
he has seven children his wife coleen was at his side 
he said that once his term was over in january 1993 he planned 
to return to the jobs he left for the governors chair those of 
builder and contractor 
polls showed his job approval rating drop severely after a 
record 168 million tax increase he pushed through the legislature 
in 1987 but it climbed after his reelection until this year 
in august a deseret newsksltv poll by dan jones amp associates 
showed bangerters popularity had fallen from 61 percent in 
december 1989 to 56 percent the disapproval rating of 41 percent 
he got in the latter survey was by far the highest of any of the 
states elected officials jones found 
but lawmakers praised him thursday 
im not quite ready to eulogize him said republican state 
senate president arnold christensen 
some of the things were proud of as a legislature like utah 
being ranked no 2 fiscally in the nation and salt lake being the 
best place to do business i think thats a credit to the

the un security council led by the 
united states voted 122 thursday to authorize military action to 
free kuwait if iraq does not withdraw its occupying troops and 
release all foreign hostages by jan 15 
the only other time the council created 45 years ago to iron 
out international disputes has sanctioned force in its history to 
counter aggression was during the korean war 
china abstained to the disappointment of the bush 
administration while cuba and yemen cast dissenting votes in a 
session arranged by the united states in a show of international 
solidarity against iraq 
in an extradordinary meeting of 13 foreign ministers the 
council handed iraqi president saddam hussein an ultimatum to 
vacate the small oilrich sheikdom that his troops invaded aug 2 
or risk military conflict with usled forces the session ended 
with a round of handshakes and embraces 
in washington president bush called the un vote a very 
strong and powerful message it will go around the world loud and 
clear that this guys got to get out of there 
once again the united nations exercising its proper 
responsibility and its peacekeeping function made a very powerful 
statement everybody ought to understand how strong it is and how 
important it is bush said minutes after the vote 
our aim today must be to convince saddam hussein that the 
just humane demands of the council and the international community 
cannot be ignored said secretary of state james a baker iii 
top representative for the united states as president of the 
council 
if iraq does not reverse its course peacefully then other 
necessary measures including the use of force should be 
authorized said baker we must put the choice to saddam 
hussein in unmistakable terms 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in a speech both 
tough and philosophical warned that saddam would be held 
personally responsible for any use of chemical weapons and 
breaches of the fourth geneva convention guaranteeing the rights of 
civilians in time of war 
he said the international community has shown genuine 
magnanimity in giving the side which breached the peace time to 
think again we have started the countdown of the pause of good 
will 
those who breached the peace should know that all necessary 
means will indeed inexorably be used against them 
shevardnadze later told reporters that the soviet union would 
not consider committing any soviet troops to an international force 
at this time he cited painful memories of world war ii 
the resolution gives saddam one final opportunity as a pause 
of good will to retreat 
but the iraqis appeared intransigent 
if war is imposed upon us by the united states this will be 
our destiny said iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari our 
people will not kneel we will rise to this responsibility 
baker at this juncture appeared to glare at the iraqi 
representative and flipped through a copy of the un charter 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd twirled his earphone all 
the ministers in session wore dark suits and sat somberly around a 
circular table in the vaulted council chamber 
the chamber is decorated with a mural of a peaceful world 
arising from the ashes of war 
kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh sabah alahmad aljaber 
however was not pacified saying the intransigence of the iraqi 
regime is pushing the region to a conflagration which we do not 
want but which appears to be the only avenue to restore our 
rights 
the kuwaiti representative denounced the wild beasts from 
iraq whom he said were pillaging his country and murdering his 
people the iraqi aggressor showed no sense of mercy or 
compassion indeed no respect for the divine or human codes of 
conduct 
previewing the un vote bush said i think the main thing 
that i hope will come out of todays session of the united nation 
is that we send perhaps the clearest signal of all to saddam 
hussein that the world is deadly serious about reversing this 
aggression and this economic oppression that hes wought on many 
many countries that can ill afford it 
iraqs ambassador accused the council of preparing to let the 
usled multinational forces lynch his country 
the council is but a willing tool in the hands of the american 
administration alanbari said 
iraq calls for peace it desires peace not for us alone but 
for the entire middle east region he said he linked iraqs 
willingness to cooperate with a broader mideast peace settlement 
that would include a homeland for palestinians 
this would be the most dangerous resolution ever passed by the 
security council alanbari said before the meeting and a 
violation of the un charter 
iraq has said it would defy the resolution as it has the 
previous 11 adopted since the invasion 
this latest council resolution strengthens bushs hand with 
congress and the american people in calling for offensive action 
against baghdad 
nine affirmative votes were required for passage any of the 
five permanent council members could have vetoed the measure three 
the united states the soviet union and britain sponsored the 
brief resolution the other permanent members are china and france 
saddam responded defiantly to the developments at the united 
nations he declared he was not afraid of fighting the united 
states which he said had been overly influenced by rambo 
movies 
the americans are still influenced by rambo movies but this is 
not a rambo movie this is something different he said 
we do not underestimate american military power but we scorn 
their evil intentions he said in remarks carried by official 
baghdad radio 
saddam said his army had the technology to defeat sophisticated 
weapons like the stealth fighter bomber there have been 
conflicting reports about whether saddam might have the ability to 
detect those weapons 
in other gulfrelated developments thursday 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who has urged patience 
in the gulf crisis shifted his tone and called for military 
pressure to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
however he repeated his desire to avoid war and did not 
elaborate on what he meant by military pressure he spoke to a 
communist party organization in moscow 
in washington there were more appeals for caution in the gulf 
james webb a former navy secretary in the reagan administration 
called the buildup of 430000 troops in the gulf a mistake and said 
attacking iraq would compound it 
the un resolution does not explicitly mention the use of 
force but authorizes member states to use all necessary means 
to implement council resolutions which demand iraqs immediate and 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
diplomats understand that to mean the use of force similar to 
the resolution calling for enforcement of a maritime embargo 
against iraq 
all diplomats have emphasized however that they are committed 
to a peaceful settlement if at all possible while critics called 
the measure a war resolution it does not mandate military 
force to evict iraq only sanctions it 
the resolution made no mention of a un military command or any 
un role in overseeing a possible international military 
operation the soviet union has sought to activate the security 
councils military staff committee and has said that soviet forces 
only would be committed to an international military operation 
under un auspices 
the council includes the five permanent members and 10 rotating 
members canada cuba colombia ethiopia finland ivory coast 
malaysia romania yemen and zaire

french foreign minister roland dumas 
can we then tolerate such a blatant challenge for any extended 
period of time especially in a region which is highly sensitive 
where the expectations for security and stability call for special 
consideration 
aggression should no longer be considered the privilege of the 
strong the misfortune of the weak and the object of resignation 
for all the rest 
this text is also consistent with the logic of the attitude 
iraq has displayed if iraq chooses to remain deaf to the appeal 
for reason and respect for law that is to say remains locked into 
the use of force what other choice are we left with but to resort 
to this same meansm which would appear to be the only ones it 
recognizes

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the security council has taken a decision of immense portent 
i would like to stress that even on the most stringent reading 
the resolution just adopted envisages at least 45 days of earnest 
effort to achieve a peaceful solution of the crisis 
to my mind the situation requires that diplomatic effort be 
undertaken with renewed determination to put the present crisis o

chinese foreign minister qian qichen 
i feel deeply that members of the international community 
share common grounds on the gulf crisis on two points namely they 
all oppose the iraqi invasion and annexation of kuwait and call on 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait immediately while at the same time 
they all wish to see that the gulf crisis be settled through 
peaceful means 
the united nations should act with great caution and avoid 
taking hasty actions on such a major question as authorizing some 
member states to take military actions against another member 
state

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
we have been faced with the first grave test of the postcold 
war period and we are coping with it 
we want begin the pause of good will by calling upon iraq and 
president saddam hussein to rise above considerations of prestige 
to display wisdom and foresight and place above all else the 
interest of the country and fate of its people 
those who break the peace should know that all necessary means 
will indeed inexorably be used against them 
all of us would only be happy if the need to resort to such 
means did not arise

the daily news filed a 150 million civil 
racketeering lawsuit thursday against a group representing striking 
workers and 23 drivers for allegedly conspiring to force the news 
to accept wasteful contracts or to sell the paper to them 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in manhattan alleges 
a conspiracy including attempted murder coercion arson and 
robbery the filing comes three days after police said there was no 
evidence of a conspiracy in 229 strikerelated incidents since the 
walkout began five weeks ago 
the lawsuit asserted that the unions had one of two intentions 
the news claimed they want to coerce the tabloid into accepting a 
featherbedding settlement that contained abuses the news has 
striven to eliminate in 10 months of negotiations 
the news also claimed that through violence the unions hoped to 
implement a buyout plan organized by theodore kheel the unions 
unpaid legal adviser 
kheel is not named in the lawsuit named are the newspaper and 
mail deliverers union of new york and vicinity the allied 
printing trades council the umbrella group representing the nine 
striking unions and 23 drivers some of whom have been arrested 
during the course of the strike 
kheel said the underpinning of this lawsuit was blown out of 
the water when top police officials said at a legislative hearing 
they had found no conspiracy 
richard weiss a spokesman for the allied said there would be 
no comment until the unions had seen the lawsuit 
this lawsuit is a response to a conspiracy of violence and 
intimidation that has victimized the news its dealers advertisers 
and readers since the strike began said news publisher james 
hoge in a statement given reporters 
we intend to resist this campaign of violence and coercion 
with every legal means at our disposal 
the 23 drivers named in the action include individuals who have 
been arrested in connection with specific acts of violence in the 
bitter strike 
nine of the newspapers 10 unions representing some 2100 
strikers have been off the job since oct 25 the newspaper has 
published daily despite distribution problems some of which have 
been linked to threats against vendors and attacks on trucks and 
replacement workers 
rico or racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act has 
been used successfully by federal prosecutors provisions of the 
act that enable law enforcement officials to assess stiff civil 
penalties tying up the assets of alleged organized crime figures 
made it popular 
in recent years it has been seen as part of more civil actions 
but use in a labor dispute is very rare 
under rico a series of criminal acts must be determined to be 
part of an ongoing pattern of criminal conduct 
the lawsuit said drivers wanted to extort the news into 
preserving payments to drivers union members for fictitious and 
unwanted labor services 
the lawsuit also said through a pattern of violence and 
intimidation kheel sought to get the news to sell to him and a 
group of investors 
the news seeks 50 million but under rico a plaintiff can ask 
for triple damages or 150 million

youngs lawyers told us district judge john feikens in a 
letter that the mayor would exercise his fifth amendment rights and 
refuse to answer all questions if called as a witness in kenneth 
weiners trial

young to testify in their defense 
the three men are charged with organizing a precious metals 
scheme that bilked wealthy investors of millions of dollars

aids is steadily spreading among us women and 
by next year will become the fifth leading cause of death for women 
of childbearing age federal health researchers reported thursday 
the us centers for disease control study is the latest to show 
that aids has become a serious health threat for women 
another study released thursday in geneva by the world health 
organization said the incidence of aids among women will increase 
dramatically worldwide mostly because women dont suspect they can 
contract the disease from heterosexual contact 
i think these findings are a cause for alarm for almost 
everyone said dr constance wofsy an aids specialist at the 
university of california san francisco 
the cdc said in its weekly report that by the end of 1990 more 
than 15000 women will have aids accounting for 11 percent of all 
reported cases more than 9000 will have died from the disease 
it said 85 percent of women with aids infections are between 
ages 15 and 44 
in 1982 aids wasnt even on the chart said dr james 
curran director of the agencys aids program in 1987 it was 
eighth leading cause of death among women 1544 and we project it 
to be fifth by 1991 
cancer is the no 1 killer of women of childbearing age 
followed by accidental deaths heart disease homicide and suicide 
the cdc said curran estimated aids is currently the sixth or 
seventh leading cause 
in the last year aids in women increased 29 percent to an 
average of 43 cases and about 27 deaths per 100000 aids rose 18 
percent among men according to the cdc 
the disease is most prevalent among women who are poor or 
minorities the cdc said though black and hispanic women make up 
19 percent of all us women they represent 72 percent of women 
with aids 
women are most likely to become infected from sexual contact 
with men who have the aids virus the disease which destroys the 
bodys ability to fight disease still occurs mostly among 
homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
the share of aids infections around the world resulting from sex 
between men and women will rise from 60 percent to 75 percent to 80 
percent by the year 2000 the world health organization report 
said 
the organization forecast that by the end of the decade the 
number of hiv carriers would rise to between 25 million and 30 
million worldwide including 10 million children born to infected 
mothers 
the organization said about a third of the 9 million to 11 
million people now carrying the virus are women 
ms wofsy said that because women tend to get aids from 
heterosexual contact few ever suspect theyre at risk and many 
fail to take advantage of preventive measures 
when women get sick they usually go to doctors who are not 
inclined to look for hiv infection she said 
physicians are going to have to become detectives ms wofsy 
said its here now 
the latest reports on aids and women came just two days before 
world aids day will be observed with this years theme being the 
diseases impact on women 
in other aids reports 
the cdc said a study in new york has provided more evidence of 
an association between the aids virus and cervical disease in 
women but the cdc stopped short of saying that hivinfected women

andrei lukanov the moscoweducated man 
who headed bulgarias first freely elected government stumbled 
over his communist past in a country paying dearly for 44 years 
allegiance to stalinist doctrine 
lukanov 52 came to prominence early this year when he was 
appointed to head a new government in february four months after 
longtime communist party strongman todor zhivkov was forced out of 
power in a politburo coup 
lukanov was said to have been one of those involved in ousting 
zhivkov on nov 10 1989 six days later lukanov was promoted to 
the ruling politburo and was said to be no 2 in the party 
hierarchy in charge of party organization 
from the start of his rocky 10 months as head of government 
which ended thursday with his resignation lukanov sought 
cooperation from the opposition still in the throes of organizing 
as a political force 
but the anticommunist opposition has steadfastly refused to 
cooperate with the communists or their successors the socialists 
that has been its greatest strength rallying everincreasing 
support the opposition parties grouped in the union of democratic 
forces alliance threaten to eclipse the flickering power of the 
socialists 
the communists renamed their party the socialist party in april 
and won free elections in june now holding 210 seats in the 
400seat parliament 
lukanov promised to move the country to a market economy when he 
and his allcommunist government were sworn into office in 
february 
he reiterated his commitment to reform when his new 
allsocialist government took office last september but the 
oppositions refusal to support the former communists or give its 
blessing to lukanovs reform program led to a political stalemate 
lukanovs popularity due to his vigor statesmanlike manner 
and commitment to reform waned sharply with the decline in 
bulgarians living standards 
store shelves are bare electricity is cut several times a day 
because of shortages and staples such as sugar cooking oiland 
gasoline are rationed 
lukanov has blamed his inability to pull the country out of 
economic quicksand on the parliamentary oppositions refusal to 
back his economic reform plans 
last week the opposition forced a vote of noconfidence in 
lukanovs government he survived with a onevote margin 
that did not satisfy bulgarians who were tired of communist 
accolades and unwilling to hear further pledges that the socialists 
are not the communists they once were 
hundreds of thousands joined a general strike called by the 
opposition trade union podkrepa and after four days lukanov 
finally backed down 
lukanov was born in moscow the son of a senior communist 
official he received his degree from the institute of 
international relations in moscow and began his diplomatic career 
as a junior employee at the foreign ministry 
fluent in several languages lukanov subsequently worked in 
bulgarias mission to the united nations in geneva as deputy 
minister of trade and later minister and deputy premier in charge 
of economics he was a member of the communist partys 
policysetting central committee from 1977 
it was his communist past that made him unacceptable to the 
opposition despite his western style as a statesman and his 
economic credentials 
the opposition has never called into question his 
accomplishments as an erudite and an astute politician the state 
bta news agency commented recently 
he is suspected however of being unable to oppose 
conservatism and primitivism in his party it said

exhusband after he won custody of a child born under a surrogate 
contract was convicted thursday of voluntary manslaughter 
beverly seymour had been charged with murder in the death of 
richard reams but the jury convicted her of the lesser charge she 
faces a maximum sentence of 28 years in prison including a 
threeyear term for use of a gun in the crime 
the jury reviewed the case carefully this is their verdict 
we will accept it prosecutor randy knece said 
he said he would push for the maximum sentence 
the child custody case involved a threeway battle for custody 
of 5yearold tessa reams the woman who gave birth to the girl

thursday jurors left the courthouse without speaking to reporters 
reams 47 was shot aug 27 when he went to ms seymours 
apartment in ashville about 15 miles south of columbus to pick up 
tessa after winning permanent custody of the child ms seymour had 
extensive visitation rights 
judge william ammer had instructed the jury to decide whether 
ms seymour 45 was guilty of murder voluntary manslaughter or 
negligent homicide or whether the gun went off accidentally as she 
acted in selfdefense during an alleged assault by reams 
knece told jurors during closing arguments wednesday that the 
evidence proved ms seymour was angry that reams had won custody 
and shot her former husband without provocation 
he noted the shooting occurred on the first visitation exchange 
involving the child after the court ruling 
defense lawyer robert head criticized prosecutors for what he 
said was heavyhanded treatment of witnesses and tactics that kept 
them from investigating all angles of the case 
ms seymour had testified that her former husband had beaten her 
and was about to do so again when she shot him head had said 
during the trial that reams was shot when ms seymour went for her 
gun and it accidentally discharged 
tessa was born in 1985 to norma lee stotski who was 
artificially inseminated and was paid 10000 to be a surrogate 
mother a courtordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor 
other than reams was used 
the reamses divorced in 1986 in the custody fight that ensued 
juvenile court judge ronald solove ruled aug 20 in favor of reams 
who already had temporary custody 
the babys biological father who was an acquaintance of ms 
stotskis did not seek custody 
ms stotski asked for custody of tessa after the shooting but 
permanent custody was awarded oct 3 to the franklin county

florida gov bob martinez arrived in the 
nations capital thursday to be nominated as the nations next drug 
czar 
bush administration officials acknowleged that martinez who 
lost a reelection bid earlier this month would be announced 
friday as the next director of the office of drug enforcement 
he replaces william bennett who president bush wants as the 
next chairman of the republican national committee 
martinez arrived in the nations capital thursday his chief of 
staff brian ballard said only that martinez will be in washington 
for two days 
but bush administration officials speaking on the condition 
they not be identified further acknowledged that martinez 
appointment would be announced friday at the white house the 
position is subject to senate confirmation 
martinez 55 was accompanied by his wife mary jane after the 
appointment is formally announced he is expected to visit with 
congressional leaders before returning to florida for the weekend 
martinez was defeated in the nov 6 gubernatorial election by 
democrat lawton chiles 
the selection of martinez for the drug post already has its 
strong critics in congress 
im disappointed the president chose a political reject to 
give this awesome responsibility said rep charles rangel 
dny chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and 
control in a telephone interview but rangel conceded that the 
appointment is expected to be confirmed 
i hope he bush gives him more authority and clout than he 
did bennett said rangel 
martinez a staunch supporter of the bush administration moved 
quickly to the top of the list of candidates for head of the office 
of national drug control policy after bennett resigned and martinez 
lost his reelection bid 
bennetts salary this year was 99500 slightly less than the 
100883 the governor earned in 1990 
during his four years in office martinez initiated several 
highprofile antidrug policies and even took a drug test himself 
to set an example for state workers 
martinez also got the legislature to pass a law mandating the 
death penalty for drug kingpins in certain cases and pushed through 
a bill requiring tougher penalties for drug dealers who traffick 
near schools 
the governor also is chairman of the national governors 
association task force on substance abuse and drug trafficking he 
visited bolivia and colombia in 1988 with the national guard on a 
drug factfinding mission 
when news of the appointment surfaced it drew some criticism 
from congressmen who saw it as a political payback rather than a 
decision based on the republican martinezs experience 
bush campaigned hard for martinez in his failed reelection bid 
and barbara bush even made a campaign commercial for him 
but even democrats in florida supported the martinez choice 
including chiles 
he knows so well how important florida would be in fighting 
that battle id like to see him appointed chiles said recently 
before his election in 1986 martinez served two terms as mayor 
of tampa a longtime democrat he switched to the republican party 
in 1983 
the governors single term was beset by problems the worst of 
which was a proposal to extend the sales tax on services martinez 
fought for the tax then reversed himself and led a repeal under 
pressure from advertisers who didnt want to pay it relations with 
the legislature were never the same 
martinez made national headlines in 1989 when he called a 
special session to restrict access to abortion the first state to 
do so after the us supreme court gave states more power to 
regulate abortion but the legislature rejected his proposals in a 
defeat for antiabortion forces

sen alan cranston told the senate ethics 
committee he was politically stupid but ethically correct in 
soliciting large contributions from former sampl owner charles h 
keating jr according to testimony released thursday 
cranston in testimony given in closed session last april 30 
also said it was unwise of his chief fundraiser to link the 
solicitations to keatings battle with thrift regulators several 
memos from the fundraiser to the senator made that connection 
the california democrat solicited keating for donations to three 
voter registration projects he supported and received 850000 
keating or his associates also donated 39000 to cranstons own 
campaigns 
i see nothing ethically morally or legally wrong with the 
amounts that were involved cranston said i will grant that it 
turned out to be politically stupid and unwise because its caused 
an uproar that i regret but being politically stupid or unwise is 
quite different from being ethically improper 
cranston received more from keating than any of the four other 
senators under investigation for intervening with banking 
regulators on keatings behalf 
the businessman was responsible for funneling a total of 13 
million for the campaigns or causes of all five much of it while 
regulators were investigating his failing lincoln savings and loan 
of irvine calif 
while all five senators testified previously in private all 
except cranston are scheduled to testify in the public hearings now 
in their third week 
cranston is expected to answer questions in writing because 
hes undergoing treatment for prostate cancer in california the 
other four senators are dennis deconcini dariz john mccain 
rariz john glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
cranston said keating gave to the voter projects because he 
considers himself a patriot cranston had been asked by a 
committee counsel why a conservative republican seeking support 
in his fight with regulators would support a liberal senators 
voter registration causes 
committee special counsel robert s bennett read to cranston a 
memo that has been cited previously in news stories in which joy 
jacobson the senators fundraiser wrote the senator in september 
1987 that keating would soon be coming to washington 
i have attached an article from the wall street journal which 
talks about the views of the new fhlbb federal home loan bank 
board chairman danny wall views that obviously are good news to 
keating you should ask keating for 250000 the memo said 
cranston said ms jacobson was covering two different topics 
and admitted perhaps it would be better not to cover them in the 
same memo 
the senator also said that keating or his associates never 
linked their donations with their attempts supported by cranston 
to get rid of the bank boards rule limiting risky investments 
like those made by lincoln 
it would be illegal for them to say we will raise money for 
you if you will do soandso cranston said it would be 
illegal for me to agree to any such thing but that was never 
suggested to me

the keating five senators hit savings and 
loan examiners with a full court press of criticism at a 1987 
meeting and one of the lawmakers pushed for changes in unfavorable 
findings on an embattled sampl one of the regulators testified 
thursday 
michael patriarca told the senate ethics committee which is 
investigating the senators conduct on behalf of charles h keating 
jr and his lincoln savings and loan that the lawmakers appeared 
to have decided that we were in fact harassing lincoln that we 
were incorrect wrong 
patriarca said dennis deconcini at the april 9 1987 meeting 
acted as master of ceremonies and added it was my 
impression quite frankly that sen deconcini was negotiating on 
behalf of lincoln 
he said the senator was attempting to get us the regulators 
to change our position on the examination the examination findings 
and conclusions to more closely align with the position that 
lincoln espoused 
keating was contending during this period that lincoln was sound 
and that regulators were trying to harass the institution which 
was seized by the government in april 1989 at a potential cost to 
taxpayers of more than 2 billion 
the regulators told the five senators at the meeting according 
to a transcript that allegations against lincoln were so serious 
that criminal referrals would be made to the justice department 
however patriarca said the tone that the meeting took was 
that the senators seemed to have made up their minds on the basis 
of information acquired before the meeting that we were in fact 
harassing lincoln that we were incorrect wrong and basically we 
got the full court press 
he said the senators became less aggressive after learning 
of the potential criminality the fullcourt press that 
challenged our conclusions about the exam was reduced 
significantly he testified 
patriarca said the justice department initially declined to 
bring criminal prosecutions based on the referrals but it is my 
understanding that it is currently the subject of an ongoing 
investigation 
the role the senators played in the meeting with four regulators 
will be important in the ethics committees determination whether 
they intervened improperly on keatings behalf 
the committee completed an eighth day of hearings on the conduct 
of deconcini dariz john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr 
dmich alan cranston dcalif and john glenn dohio 
the five received a combined total of 13 million from keating 
and his associates for their campaigns and causes most of it 
donated while regulators from the federal home loan bank board were 
examining the failing lincoln 
cranston who accounted for 889000 of that total said in 
testimony released thursday that his involvement with keating was 
politically stupid cranston gave the testimony last april in a 
closed session with the committee 
i see nothing ethically morally or legally wrong with the 
amounts that were involved cranston testified last spring i 
will grant that it turned out to be politically stupid and unwise 
because its caused an uproar that i regret but being politically 
stupid or unwise is quite different from being ethically 
improper 
a week before the meeting with the examiners all the senators 
except riegle had met with edwin j gray then chairman of the bank 
board gray has testified that deconcini offered him a deal to 
benefit lincoln and that cranston mccain and glenn quietly 
acquiesced 
deconcini in whose office both meetings took place has 
vigorously denied making the offer involving withdrawal of a board 
regulation and the other three senators said they did not recall 
the proposal 
the meeting on april 9 with san franciscobased regulators was 
scheduled because gray was unable to answer questions about the 
examination of lincoln in the previous weeks gettogether 
commenting on the four senators other than deconcini patriarca 
said 
glenn was blunt at the meeting and seemed to have also 
made up his mind our behavior was somehow wrong 
mccain appeared uncomfortable being at the meeting and made 
statements to the effect of wanting to establish it was okay to be 
there 
sen riegle did what i would characterize as 
crossexamination to probe the basis for the findings that we were 
saying we reached 
cranston made only a brief appearance because he was managing 
legislation on the senate floor 
patriarca now western regional director for the office of 
thrift supervision said regulators had found absolutely 
reckless practices by the irvine califbased savings and loan 
he said there was evidence the thrifts files had been stuffed with 
phony underwriting documents in an attempt to justify loans 
in the spring of 1988 patriarca testified he received 
indications that keatings political clout went beyond persuading 
five senators to meet with regulators 
patriarca said he urged the bank board chief of staff to deny 
lincolns request to transfer the case away from san francisco 
according to patriarca the chief of staff jim boland replied 
these guys are so well connected they can get you in ways youll 
never know youve been gotten 
i took that to mean mr boland thought the political 
connections of lincoln warranted transferring jurisdiction of 
lincoln to some other place patriarca said 
committee special counsel robert s bennett said boland denied 
making the remark the lincoln case was transferred from san 
francisco to washington

a publisher filed a lawsuit against the 
irancontra special prosecutor that accuses him of threatening 
criminal action to stifle a book about oliver norths case 
the lawsuit filed wednesday by penguin books seeks to bar 
lawrence walsh the independent counsel from interfering with 
publication of jeffrey toobins opening arguments a young 
lawyers first case united states v oliver north 
toobins 384page book is ready for distribution to reviewers 
and is scheduled for publication by viking early next year said 
paul slovak spokesman for viking and its parent corporation 
penguin usa 
the lawsuit seeks to bar walsh from threatening harassing and 
stonewalling toobin whose book is an account of his two years with 
walshs office 
the lawsuit also asks that a judge declare in advance that the 
book does not violate laws about disclosing confidential 
information and that the government may not attempt to tie up 
toobins royalties 
toobin 30 now an assistant us attorney in brooklyn was part 
of walshs team from 1987 until last year 
former marine lt col oliver north was convicted last year of 
three felonies including aiding and abetting the obstruction of 
congress and the destruction of government documents 
the charges arose out of norths involvement in the irancontra 
scandal which involved covert military assistance to the 
nicaraguan rebels known as the contras and the sale of us arms to 
iran 
the lawsuit said walsh claims the final version of the book 
improperly discloses staff discussions and internal memos of the 
office and violates grand jury secrecy 
upon leaving walshs office toobin signed an agreement to 
submit anything he wrote for government review the lawsuit said 
toobin and michael jacobs president of vikingpenguin would 
not talk about the books contents the lawsuit denies the book 
contains illegal disclosures 
speaking for walsh in washington mary belcher said toobins 
manuscript revealed nonpublic aspects of criminal 
investigations identified persons investigated but not indicted 
and talked about criminal charges considered but not made 
we believe that such disclosures not only would violate mr 
toobins legal obligations but also would be unfair to the 
individuals involved and harmful to the continuing work of this 
office ms belcher said 
the lawsuit said that while toobin and walsh haggled over the 
content of opening arguments for more than a year the justice 
department and the cia both had read and cleared it 
it said toobin made changes walsh requested but walsh has 
continued to object to the book without giving specifics 
it is both ironic and unfortunate that mr walsh who has 
sought to unveil government secrets in his investigation is now 
attempting to prevent publication of book that sheds light on a 
matter of great public importance said martin garbus penguins 
lawyer

the case of seven sheriffs deputies accused 
of skimming 14 million in drug money went to a jury thursday with 
a prosecutor calling them corrupt and the defense saying the 
government used unreliable witnesses 
the trial lasted seven weeks and focused the spotlight on a 
scandal which embarrassed sheriff sherman block and his department 
in the nations most populous county 
with all the power the government has they have not proved 
their case beyond a reasonable doubt attorney harland braun told 
jurors and that is because the defendants are innocent 
braun who represents former deputy daniel garner blamed robert 
sobel the governments star witness against the deputies and the 
former chief of the elite narcotics squad called major violators 
ii 
braun portrayed sobel as a thug and a liar 
sobel is worthless braun told the jury it would demean 
our history our jury system if you based a verdict on someone like 
robert sobel 
the seven defendants terrell amers james bauder eufrasio 
cortez ronald daub john dickenson garner and macario duran are 
charged with conspiracy theft racketeering tax fraud and money 
laundering 
us district judge edward rafeedie ordered the jury to begin 
their deliberations friday 
braun criticized prosecutors for using drug suspects as 
witnesses and said testimony had shown the government operated its 
own undercover money laundering operation returning drug profits 
to the colombians 
assistant us attorney thomas a hagemann said there are some 
things the government does that arent very pretty but its 
done according to the book and approved at the highest level of 
government washington says ok because its a drug war and there 
are benefits so there is an undercover money laundering 
operation 
as for the drug suspects hagemann said the government didnt 
choose them as witnesses he said the defendants caused such people 
to become witnesses in the case by allegedly stealing money from 
them 
during the trial the deputies testified that they made luxury 
purchases of boats cars and vacatins by legitimate means with 
money obtained from savings relatives overtime work and yard 
sales 
these are the defenses of wishful thinking hagemann said of 
the deputies evidence a defense made up of nonsense

in the lawsuit against turner broadcasting systems inc houston 
mccoy seeks 14 million for emotional distress and damage to his 
reputation 
mccoy who lives in menard in west texas filed the federal 
lawsuit wednesday in austin 
the lawsuit contends the 1975 movie the deadly tower has 
caused mccoy to become an alcoholic and lose selfrespect 
mccoy claims the film depicts him as a coward although he says 
he was commended for bravery after the sniper incident 
turner broadcasting did not immediately return a telephone call 
thursday 
on aug 1 1966 university of texas student charles whitman 
climbed 27 floors to the top of the clock tower in the center of 
the campus and opened fire with a highpowered rifle 
fourteen people were shot to death and 34 were wounded 
authorities also discovered the bodies of whitmans wife and mother 
in their austin homes both had been slain by whitman before the 
tower rampage 
whitman was stopped when city police officers ramiro martinez 
and mccoy climbed to the top of the tower and shot him 
mccoy claimed in the lawsuit that he was portrayed as a coward 
to enhance the dramatic character of the movies hero 
martinez 
martinez now a texas ranger had no comment on mccoys lawsuit 
martinez said he filed a lawsuit against the producers of the 
movie in 1975 because there was so much in the movie that was 
untruthful just fiction that lawsuit was settled out of 
court he said 
turner broadcasting showed the movie on television in august 
1988 april 1989 and july 1990 mccoy said in his lawsuit it aired 
again tuesday on turners station 
had turner broadcasting investigated the facts of the 
incident it would have discovered that the movie contained factual 
inaccuracies mccoy said 
the former officer said he is unable to see or hear about the 
movie without slipping into deep depression

president mikhail s gorbachev on thursday dropped 
his calls for patience in the persian gulf and called for military 
pressure to force iraq from kuwait but he repeated his desire to 
avoid war 
speaking to a conference of the moscow city communist party 
organization he declared everything must be done including 
military pressure pressure i am using that word exactly to 
force the hussein regime to understand that the annexation must be 
halted and the situation returned to aug 2 
since iraqi president saddam husseins troops invaded kuwait on 
that date gorbachev has been urging opponents to be patient and 
exhaust all political means to avoid further bloodshed he has 
asked that economic sanctions ordered by the un security 
council be given more time to work against saddam he has been 
reluctant to endorse harsher measures 
in his speech thursday gorbachev reiterated soviet desire to 
avoid war saying that everything must be done to solve this 
question politically and that our goal remains unchanged to 
achieve a political solution 
but for the first time in public he mentioned military

police and fire unions filed suit thursday 
seeking to block the use of pension assets for a city bailout 
lodge 5 fraternal order of police and local 22 international 
association of fire fighters filed the lawsuit against the board 
of pensions and retirement and its members 
the lawsuit contends the 15 billion pension fund cannot 
legally buy philadelphia notes because of statutes barring risky 
investments 
it is not a slush fund for the city union attorney john k 
weston told judge nicholas dalessandro during an emergency 
hearing 
chief deputy city solicitor ralph j teti argued the lawsuit was 
premature although the city hopes the pension board will back a 
planned note sale no formal proposal has been made he said 
the net effect of a temporary restraining order would be to 
kill the bailout to kill the hopes of the city of philadelphia to 
continue to operate as a viable entity teti said 
dalessandro denied the unions request for a temporary 
restraining order he scheduled another hearing for monday 
the citys coffers are expected to be empty by christmas without 
a cash infusion holding up paychecks for 30000 city workers 
disrupting city services and halting public works projects 
the city is trying to put together about a 300 million 
shortterm note offering with backing from the pension fund local 
banks state treasury and private investors 
the philadelphia inquirer quoted unidentified sources thursday 
saying four banks have offered to buy 100 million of the notes but 
are demanding 10 percent to 13 percent taxexempt interest 
new york city last week sold 13 billion in shortterm notes at 
7 percent 
the sources told the newspaper the banks also have asked to be 
repaid before other note buyers 
other bank demands include creation of an asyet undefined 
fiscal control board to supervise city finances a city pledge not 
to file for bankruptcy protection before the notes are repaid and 
adoption of a longrange plan to prevent future budget crises the 
newspaper said 
the sources said the terms were preliminary and under 
negotiation 
spokesmen for corestates financial corp provident national 
bank meridian bancorp inc and mellon bank would not comment on 
the report 
teti said the pension board would meet behind closed doors 
friday with washington attorney ian lanoff a pension law expert 
to discuss the note offering 
the meeting will be to discuss the parameters of a deal and 
maybe fill in some of the blanks he said 
the notes would be intended to keep the city afloat until 
property and business taxes come due next spring 
even with the money the city projects a 2295 million deficit 
during the fiscal year that began july 1 and a 278 million deficit 
during fiscal 1992 
to offset the deficits mayor w wilson goode and other 
democratic officials have urged new taxes spending cuts the sale 
of city assets increased state and federal aid longterm deficit 
financing and efficiencies in local courts 
city finance director elizabeth c reveal has called the pension 
funds role the linchpin of the shortterm deal

10year sentence 
bateman 50 is prohibited by the oregon parole board from 
returning to his old portland neighborhood he must undergo 
treatment and random polygraph tests 
i dont think its fair myself bateman said 
i would like to say that i believe the media has blown me 
totally out of proportion he said ive been singled out like 
im the only person thats ever committed a crime

1985 he had prior convictions for sex abuse kidnapping and sodomy 
involving a 9yearold girl 
baker ordered him to display signs with at least 3inch letters

and unusual punishment 
bateman didnt comply with the order and baker revoked his 
probation and sent him to prison in 1988

drywall installer not to retrrn to his house or any place near his 
old portland neighborhood he had lived a halfblock from an 
elementary school 
neighbors had asked that he not be allowed to return there 
bateman said he wanted to go back to his old neighborhood 
because he feels the people there have nothing to fear from him 
all i want to do is find a job and complete my parole just 
like everyone else he said i dont think they should be 
afraid of me at all 
bateman released from oregon state penitentiary in salem must 
complete a treatment program for sex offenders and another one for 
alcohol abusers he is prohibited from having contact with minors

the opposition labor party won two 
special parliamentary elections in western scotland in the first 
electoral test of britains new conservative government according 
to results early friday 
the labor victories in the two strongholds of that party had 
been widely predicted they caused no great upset to the government 
of newly appointed prime minister john major who replaced margaret 
thatcher 
still the labor party hailed the results of thursdays voting 
its financial affairs spokesman john smith said the change of 
leader and removal of mrs thatcher has made no difference and 
brought no benefit to the conservative party especially in this 
part of the country 
in north paisley labor candidate irene adams won 11353 votes 
or 439 percent against 7583 votes or 294 percent for roger 
mullin of the scottish national party and 3835 votes or 148 
percent for ewan marwick of the conservatives smaller groups won 
the rest of the votes 
in south paisley labor candidate gordon mcmaster won 12485 
votes or 461 percent against 7455 votes or 275 percent for iain 
lawson of the scottish national party and 3627 votes or 134 
percent for john workman of the conservatives the other votes were 
gained by smaller groups 
the scottish national party seeks independence from the rest of 
britain for scotlands 52 million people the conservatives who 
have their main support in southern england are generally 
unpopular in scotland 
dubbed the forgotten elections the campaigns for the paisley 
elections was largely pushed from the national news by the 
conservative party leadership battle which ended wednesday with 
majors appointment 
the british domestic news agency press association commenting 
after the paisley results said the conservatives vote held 
up respectably and john major can be satisfied with his partys 
performance 
lord sanderson chairman of the conservative party in scotland 
said there was an antithatcher factor working i do think john 
major will improve our chances in scotland 
the elections in paisley a former weaving town near glasgow 
which has been hard hit by unemployment were caused by the deaths 
of the two previous labor legislators 
the election results leave unchanged the conservatives 98seat 
majority over all the other house of commons parties combined

minutes after mesmerizing an audience with 
his electric guitar wizardry rocker eric johnson is shyly greeting 
fans and signing autographs 
he talks with such humility and kindness that its a tossup 
which is more enchanting the music he makes on stage or his boyish 
friendliness backstage 
underneath the good humor lies a demanding perfectionism in a 
musician on a quest for a brandnew sound from his 54 fender 
stratocaster 
the older i get the more i listen to the guitar and go oh 
god i need a new turnon its got to do something more is this 
all johnson said in an interview you can get a screechy 
nervous jittery sound out of the electric guitar and its like 
gah its got to go farther now 
im trying to figure out a way i want it to be real 
rockedoutandbuzz guitar but i want it to have a little elegance 
to it and in its real neanderthal paleolithic way i want it to 
have a tuxedo on 
elegance isnt a word often tied to the electric guitar but 
johnson was schooled in classical piano and hes found ways to 
bring the two together 
i try to listen to more classical music because of the chord 
changes and the breadth of the music to me classical in a way is 
the most unassuming music johnson said 
johnson 35 first hit the austin music scene in the 1970s at 
age 15 mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that 
evoked images of rock revolutionary jimi hendrix 
the late stevie ray vaughan was among those awed by his talent 
vaughan once said that by the time johnson reached his late teens 
he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to 
keep up with him 
johnsons solo debut album tones earned him a 1986 grammy 
nomination for best instrumental of the year for the track 
zap however the album had little commercial success 
nearly four years later johnson has poured his heart and 
experience into a new album ah via musicom on capitol records 
the album and its rich instrumental cliffs of dover have 
received favorable response and substantial play on albumonly rock 
radio stations 
johnson said the album has changed his audiences from the 
musiciansonly crowd to the fickle radio listeners eternally 
searching for a new sound and new star 
some of the credit must go to capitol records which has heavily 
promoted the album johnson said 
but the album also is the embodiment of what makes johnson 
great his tireless perfectionism and insatiable search for a 
different sound 
i spent two months solid working on tones i spent 15 months 
on this last record not solid but close to it i just did it over 
and over and over trying to figure out a way to get the guitar 
tone like i wanted it he said 
according to capitol records johnson recorded ah via 
musicom three times with two bass players kyle brock and roscoe 
beck three drummerpercussionists tommy taylor james ferner and 
paul bissell and several arrangements 
brock who has played with johnson 20 years and taylor 
formerly a drummer for christopher cross are traveling with 
johnson the three joined rock guitarist joe satriani in california 
in late september for three weeks of concerts on the west coast 
i like to think erics music is the music were all involved 
in taylor said its something a little promising and offers a 
little alternative so much of the music you hear is very 
predictable theres a freshness about what eric does 
what johnson eternally seeks from his guitar and amplifiers and 
electronic gizmos is what musicians call tone 
tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of 
sound of a particular instrument the way you play the instrument 
the emotion you put behind it the technique phrasing all the 
things that are elements of your art or your music that create a 
sound he said 
johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional 
amplifiers and foot pedals from the 60s and 70s that lack the 
computer chips found in todays equipment 
in his live performances he spreads a buffet of pedals before 
his feet while his fingers dance over the frets of his guitar his 
feet skip between the pedals producing an energetic intellectual 
sound 
theres kind of this side of me that treats it the music 
like a laboratory where i work in the studio or i work in my 
practice house and fiddle with all sorts of electronics and stuff 
trying to make the guitar sound better johnson said 
i dont mean that with a negative connotation but you play 
for 20 years and its the same old guitar sound at this point im 
not reinventing the guitar i dont have a whole new sound or 
anything but im trying to figure out a way to hone and perfect 
the electrical guitar sound

maureen oboyle anchors a current affair 
this means she gets to advise viewers as she did one enchanted 
evening that the show is breaking the news of the dirtiest 
divorce of the decade 
that is some leap from her first job in tv she was a college 
freshman then a raw rookie doing the morning news at a station in 
washington nc it wasnt easy being green she recalls telling 
viewers this 
thank you very much for joining us and there will be more news 
coming up today at noon and again at 6 oclock dont forget to 
watch clara scott and the rest of the eyewitness news team here on 
channel 9 
as she was on channel 7 when she said this she and management 
agreed she wasnt quite ready for anchoring however she said the 
executives told her she seemed to have a natural ability for tv and 
not to give up 
the news director he was in tears and i think he was getting 
ready to get the boot too said i hope you get back into this 
some day 
she did and now at 27 the tall rangy native of charlotte 
nc is the new anchor of fox broadcastings syndicated a 
current affair the senior citizen of tabloid tv seen on 195 
stations 
oboyle has been with affair as a reporter and occasional 
anchor since it went into national syndication in 1988 last month 
she was named to succeed maury povich as the shows anchor in the 
199192 season 
povich 51 with affair since it began as a new yorkonly 
event in 1986 is leaving when his contract ends in june hell go 
host a talk show that a fox rival paramount television plans to 
emit next fall 
oboyle already has replaced povich sort of she has anchored 
affair since october theres been no word when hell 
materialize again although a spokeswoman for the show says hell 
return at some point this season 
in the meantime the shows nielsens have slowly risen since her 
october arrival 
oboyle who offcamera has a breezy whatthehey manner is 
markedly different from povich when shes at the anchor desk 
he sometimes is moved to a mild leer and his general demeanor 
suggests that of a headmaster at the american academy of weird 
she on the other hand is brisk and nononsense even when her 
copy is classic lurid as in its description of the dirtiest 
divorce of the decade 
a woman who claims her husband betrayed her with a video 
camera and turned their love into a tawdry xrated movie 
oboyle who comes from a family of 10 kids reported plumb 
ordinary news at stations in wilmington nc macon ga and 
spokane wash before affair 
she isnt dismayed by those who knock the show as tabloid tv or 
nocal national enquirer in fact she said i was attracted to 
the show because of some of the things that people didnt like 
about it 
it really was totally different from anything id ever seen 
it had great stories with real characters 
said stories she submits are morality plays in a way 
theyre stories about people who are good people who are bad and 
all the consequences that happen 
not all are lurid of course some are well one she 
particularly remembers concerned an alaska gold miner who 
advertised for a bride a young beauty in florida responded 
letters of love soon flew back and forth 
oboyle persuaded her bosses that this was a story for the ages 
then she her camera crew and the florida beauty flew to alaska 
to meet the miner who was way way back in the hills they took a 
singleengine plane and flew through a thunderstorm to get there 
the prospect of capturing the first meeting of the longdistance 
lovebirds on tape caused rampant excitement said oboylewe were 
picturing music hearts aflutter 
well there was a happy ending of sorts but the kind only a 
grizzled editor could love 
they hated each other from the moment we got there oboyle 
said 
 
elsewhere in television 
brokaw checks out cops koppel discusses war nbc anchorman tom 
brokaw is trailing houston cops around next friday night in 
houston homicide a taped onehour special in which he hangs 
out with detectives investigating the slaying of a businessman

fewer tourists visited nepals ancient 
temples snowy mountains and lush valleys in 1990 and officials 
blame trouble elsewhere in the world 
they say the persian gulf crisis was the main problem last year 
also was a bad one for this picturepostcard kingdom in the 
himalayas largely because a trade dispute with neighboring india 
caused gasoline shortages 
this year you can find a hotel room anytime you want said 
surendra shakya manager of the yak and yeti hotel in katmandu the 
capital previously you would have been lucky to find standing 
space 
thousands of tourists changed plans this spring when the 
country was in the grip of a mass uprising that brought democracy 
to nepal by stripping king birendra of nearabsolute powers and 
making him a constitutional monarch 
hoteliers say 50 percent of those who had booked rooms did not 
turn up during the years second tourist season which started in 
midseptember when the monsoon ended 
most of the cancellations came from the united states and 
germany nepals two major tourist markets in the west they said 
the americans are big spenders and they have not come to this 
part of the world because of fear of war in the middle east a 
hotel manager said on condition of anonymity 
the state department advised americans they might become targets 
in south asia the middle east and north africa because of tensions 
in the gulf where us forces were deployed after iraq occupied 
kuwait on aug 2 
most air routes to nepal pass over the gulf region and many 
tourists want to avoid it nepalese officials said in addition 
air fares are rising because of higher fuel prices 
according to the tourism department only 176000 tourists had 
visited nepal in 1990 compared to about 240000 in 1989 
anup rana owner of the yellow pagoda hotel and president of the 
hotel association of nepal said reservations for october and 
november were down by 30 percent from the same months in 1988 
one travel agent said he received cancellations from 160 tour 
groups on a single day in september the agent who asked not to be 
identified said he fears many more in the coming months 
trouble in neighboring countries also affected nepals tourism 
because travelers usually buy holiday packages that include 
destinations in nepal india and thailand 
a moslem separatist movement in kashmir and class and sectarian 
violence in other parts of india contributed to the downturn this 
year said dipendra purush dhakal director general of nepals 
tourism department 
another tourism department official said bargain tickets offered 
by governmentowned royal nepal airlines had not helped the 
reduced airfares tend to attract only lowbudget tourists who stay 
in cheap hotels that charge less than 5 a day the official said 
although pleasure travel is down adventure tourists apparently 
are not affected trekking agencies are as busy as in other years 
they know there is more risk involved in climbing mount 
everest or rafting down the rapids of himalayan rivers than flying 
over the middle east said stanley armington the owner of a 
trekking agency 
squeezed between the vastness of china to the north and india to 
the south nepal includes eight peaks higher than 26000 feet 
including mount everest the highest point in world at 29028 feet 
adventure travelers unlike general tourists plan their trips a 
year in advance making late cancellations difficult said 
armington who left san francisco 20 years ago to set up shop in 
katmandu 
trekking agencies have been able to sell nepal as the primary 
destination in south asia for adventure travelers of nepals 
240000 tourists last year 40000 came only for trekking which 
introduces visitors to one of the worlds richest wildlife 
habitats 
nepal contains less than 1 percent of the planets land mass 
but roughly 10 percent its bird species about 800

when this recession is over and done with it 
might be wise to study how much uncertainty contributed to it 
nowhere in the array of statistics is there a measurement of 
this factor the strength or weakness of almost anything you can 
think of is measured by the numbers but uncertainty perhaps the 
biggest factor of all is only sensed 
it is sensed by government officials by borrowers bankers 
investors lenders business executives consumers and the impact 
on each is identical it makes them veto spending lending or 
borrowing plans 
uncertainty is on everyones lips 
consumers dont know what to expect said norman d flynn 
president of the national association of realtors when people 
dont know whats coming they tend to delay bigticket 
expenditures 
and he said that doesnt just involve plans to buy houses but 
all the items that often go into that house such as furniture 
drapes and appliances and that of course creates uncertainty in 
those that make such items 
even if they cant translate it into a number there is hardly 
an economist alive who isnt using the term to describe the 
situation today 
an example from murray weidenbaum president reagans chief 
economic adviser and now director of the center for the study of 
american business 
the uncertainties in the middle east generally and in the 
world oil market specifically reinforced the negative outlook in 
the domestic economy in the weeks that followed the invasion of 
kuwait 
alan greenspan federal reserve chairman cited uncertainty in 
testimony this week before the house banking committee the 
slowdown he said could be traced to rising oil prices credit 
tightening by banks and uncertainty about how and when the 
tensions in the persian gulf will be resolved 
why have banks tightened credit to businesses and individuals 
uncertainty they say with big lending losses and uncertainty 
about the economy they have been denying loans foreclosing on 
existing ones and reducing credit lines 
such action by banks without prodding from the federal reserve 
is almost unheard of so bad has it become that president bush and 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady have expressed concern and 
urged bankers to be freer with credit even greenspan viewed as a 
tight money man has encouraged that view 
when uncertainty prevails risktakers run for cover businesses 
cut capital spending plans and inventories employers cut staffs 
bankers lock vaults consumers forgo all frivolities economic 
activity is suspended 
why the uncertainty 
first there was the battle of the federal budget then there was 
concern about the impact of the tax increases kuwait nobody could 
say where the rise in gasoline and heating oil prices would stop 
or the drop in stock prices 
nobody knows what will happen in the mideast or even in their 
home town and various polls have shown that when they dont have a 
sense of the future they inevitably turn negative uncertainty 
erodes 
and when it becomes evident that highlevel officials also are 
uncertain such as the chairman of the federal reserve then 
uncertainty spreads faster and the erosion becomes more damaging 
eventually economic activity is put on hold uncertainty by 
itself becomes a bigger factor than all the rest and it isnt 
even measured like so many lesser elements of the economy

luck timing and talent made a poor 
guitarplaying mississippi truck driver one of the most famous rock 
n roll singers in the world 
but memories of the cleancut kid from tupelo whose twisting 
pelvis shocked middleamerican parents even as his gyrations drove 
their adolescent daughters into a frenzy blurred under images of 
an older fatter elvis presley his body ravaged by drug and 
alcohol abuse 
the sexy young man whose debut coincided with the rise of 
television and loosening of racial barriers is recaptured in leroy 
kirby the main character in mark childress new novel tender 
harmony 1995 
the clean crisp prose of childress recreates the 
povertystricken childhood that forged the ambition and drive the 
real elvis presley had to have to become an american icon 
the affectionate portrait captures the early recording sessions 
and the overnight success as well as kirbys confusion as he finds 
he cant leave his memphis home without risking the attack of 
adoring fans and that even his family treats him differently 
the chapter on the first successful recording session gets 
inside the musicians motivation in a way a biographer tied to the 
facts couldnt 
he had a plan 
his last time in front of the microphone leroy had spent two 
hours trying to sing like somebody else 
tonight if he saw a way to grab the chance he would stand up 
and sing in his own voice he would use the others to get something 
powerful out of himself dan tobias was a pro tommy and jack did 
this all the time but leroy knew what was surging inside him 
trying to get out 
he had to sing so people would listen to him all hed ever 
wanted in life was love and attention 
tender is a novel about elvis but readers who look can also 
find a novel about ambition success and the problems inherent in 
getting what you wish for 
that theme is a favorite of the novelists and was central to 
his two earlier works world made of fire and v for victor 
the three novels also find a common thread in the supernatural 
in tender leroys mother assures him that he has the luck that 
would have been his dead twins and leroy french for the king 
himself talks with an imagined twin in the mirror who feeds his 
drive and eases his loneliness 
the idea for an elvis novel was probably born aug 16 1977 
when childress spent the afternoon talking to hundreds of elvis 
fans who called an alabama newspaper after the king died 
i spent the afternoon answering calls from hysterical fans who 
were griefstricken i remember being very shocked about that 
said childress who then worked at the birmingham news 
to me elvis was like wayne newton an old irrelevant person 
but these people sounded like someone in their family had died i 
thought wow what power he had childress said n an interview 
childress wanted to write about music from a musicians 
perspective 
it could have been hank williams or jerry lee lewis but i 
thought his was the most dramatic story to hang my story on 
childress said 
reviewers of the novel which the wall street journal listed 
after the american booksellers association convention as one of its 
top 10 hot books for the fall season either love it or hate it 
all the music critics hated it with a vengeance that took me 
aback they didnt just not like it they dont want people to read 
it said childress 
but publishers weekly said childress redeemed the 
biographical novel while newsday said so few people who fancy 
themselves intellectuals have ever bothered to try to understand 
the phenomenon of elvis that tender may be hailed as a 
revelation 
many people assume tender is not really fiction however 
childress counters that the first 350 pages of the novel are about 
the singers childhood biographies cover that in three or four 
pages he said 
the novel ends when kirby is drafted so childress never has to 
deal with ugly end of presleys life 
one reason for a novel instead of biography was to avoid 
gracelands image mill one thing they do is sanitize his 
image said childress elvis and his image are trademarks 
he also believes a novelist can come closer to the truth than 
a biographer 
robert penn warren got huey long by making him willie stark in 
all the kings men in a way he never could have if he had been 
constrained by the facts of huey long childress said

tim burton is young only 32 his hair is long 
too long falling over his face and sticking out at the sides his 
dreamy eyes gaze as if a movie screen is on the distant wall he 
has a lazy grin and a nervous unsettling laugh 
hardly the kind of person youd put in charge of a major motion 
picture but burton has managed quite well hes one of hollywoods 
hottest properties the director of the megabudget megasmash 
batman and the offbeat hit beetlejuice 
it makes perfect sense to him he simply points to his high 
school experience there were three kinds of male students he 
recalls athletes very popular with the girls academics 
preferred by the teachers and the freaks people meant 
perhaps to find themselves a little later in life 
i went to my 10year high school reunion a few years ago 
burton recalled in a recent interview it was so amazing some 
people peaked in high school everybody i saw who was considered an 
outcast i didnt see one example where this wasnt true they were 
incredibly attractive and successful 
you got to get it out some way if you get everything you 
want youre not going to have those desires you dont have that 
eternal conflict of getting something out 
his new film edward scissorhands is a holiday fable about 
a freak johnny depp rescued from his brokendown mansion high 
above town and taken to the nice suburban home of a friendly avon 
lady diane wiest 
a punk in whiteface and black leather edward was constructed by 
an aging scientist vincent price of course who died before he 
could make a pair of hands an array of scissors are there instead 
the neighbors all take to wiests unusual guest who endears 
himself by using his hands to artfully trim hedges poodles and 
womens hair but edward also has a soul hes in love with 
wiests beautiful and popular daughter winona ryder depps 
girlfriend in real life and must fight nasty boyfriend anthony 
michael hall for her affection 
its a classic fairy tale an image of creation and of 
destruction beauty and horror touching and not touching burton 
said its an externalization of how you feel at odds with 
yourself twosided 
beetlejuice fans will appreciate the campy sets with 
brightly painted monochromatic houses as well as matching clothes 
and billboards food too burton says he was trying to be funny 
and also wanted to make a point how people see others on just one 
level applying catchall phrases that deny any complexity 
people say youre this youre that i think theres a 
necessity for people to categorize i think it helps make them 
comfortable and some of the weirdest people ive known get it the 
worst if people cant put you into a category theyre inclined to 
just write you off as a freak 
burton who grew up in burbank calif watched sciencefiction 
and horror films as a kid and first showed talent as an artist by 
designing an antilitter poster in ninth grade that graced the 
sides of local garbage trucks 
after high school he attended the california institute of the 
arts on a disney fellowship and soon joined walt disney studios as 
an animator working on the fox and the hound and the black 
cauldron 
price was the inspiration and the narrator for his first 
film vincent an animated short completed when the director 
was just 23 his next project was frankenweenie his first live 
action film 
it happened just by osmosis that need to want to do 
something i didnt care how it manifested itself i didnt care if 
it was drawing animation whatever animation was a little too 
tedious for me live action was better because it was immediate and 
helped me come out of my shell he said 
he followed with peewees big adventure and then 
beetlejuice the wacky ghost story that helped make stars of 
ryder michael keaton geena davis and alec baldwin 
the script had no story burton recalled it was 
incredibly vague and contradicted itself all over the place i 
cant to this day say if it was good or not you just felt 
someones personality in it 
burtons confident hell keep getting better he thinks history 
hollywood history is on his side some of the great directors 
john huston billy wilder preston sturges hadnt even made films 
at his age hes still developing still learning to express 
himself

the worlds largest corporation has inherited most 
of what once was east germany with instructions to sell it off or 
close it down 
detlev rohwedder the chairman is running the sale of the 
century converting the state companies of former east germany to 
private enterprise and says he wants to do it with consideration 
for the people who might be hurt 
he is from west germany but a native of thuringia one of 
germanys five new eastern states 
i think its great to be asked by my government to be part of 
the effort rohwedder said after agreeing in early november to 
take a full fouryear term as chairman of treuhand 
the incorporated agency whose name means trust was established 
by the east german government last spring when it still was trying 
to preserve state enterprises westerners moved into the management 
later and rohwedder became chairman in august 
treuhands mandate is to sell as much as possible to private 
owners and deliver the proceeds to the national treasury it is 
empowered to close inefficient operations or divide large ones and 
sell or close the parts separately 
it has ordered all the former east german enterprises to submit 
balance sheets for analysis 
rohwedder a 58yearold lawyer had long experience in the west 
german government and was credited with the rescue from 
nearbankruptcy of the hoesch steel company 
his trust corporation is responsible for 45 million to 6 
million employees and owns 60 percent of eastern germanys forests 
35 percent of the arable land factories housing and other real 
estate 
it will take until next spring to count the employees and 
estimate what the assets are worth rohwedder said by 
midnovember the trust said it had taken in 15 billion marks 1 
billion from the sale of state companies 
although the east german economy was considered in bad shape 
its output in 1989 was estimated at the equivalent of 290 billion 
west german marks 187 billion 
real estate will be especially difficult to sell some of it was 
seized from people living in west germany or jews who fled the 
nazis many of whom have filed claims for restitution that may be 
in the courts for years 
wolf schoede spokesman for treuhand said it was the largest 
corporation in the world and it has no precedent and there will be 
no successor 
most commentators say chancellor helmut kohl could not have 
found a person with better qualifications than rohwedder to run it 
but treuhand has taken a lot of criticism in its short life 
in its nov 12 issue the weekly magazine spiegel declared that 
rohwedder was unapproachable and had quickly shown the door to 
heinz ruhnau head of the national airline lufthansa who wanted to 
buy the east german airline interflug 
foreign companies say treuhand is almost impossible to contact 
its procedures are not clear and it favors german investors 
tom sommerlatte vice president in germany of the usbased 
consulting firm arthur d little said he had contracts with 12 
east german companies that wanted to form ventures with foreign 
firms 
we have tried very hard to talk to treuhand and convince them 
of solutions we have found sommerlatte said sometimes they 
didnt even receive us we couldnt get an appointment 
when the point was raised during a meeting with foreign 
journalists rohwedder sighed and said they probably were the 
2087th call we had that day we have a small number of people 
here too few to accommodate the questions 
treuhands staff doubled in october to about 500 and will grow 
to 12001500 by the middle of 1991 rohwedder said it has 
offices in 15 cities of eastern germany and headquarters on the 
alexanderplatz the center of east berlin 
its attitude is to favor entrepreneurs and foster competition 
the chairman said that he added was why he backed away from 
lufthansas attempt to lock up almost all domestic german air 
traffic by buying interflug 
the unpleasant side of the job is to close companies whose 
products wont sell in western markets rohwedder said he had heard 
criticism that treuhand was too slow in shutting some factories and 
explained his approach this way 
we could make unemployment very fast and it would take a long 
time to get back to work we have to work with love for the 
people 
he denied favoring german applicants over foreigners 
german economic policy is to be open to the outside world 
he said it stiffens competition makes people work harder and 
benefits the consumer 
rohwedder acknowledge that germans have the inside track because 
many west german companies had good business ties with east 
germany about 90 percent of the first 200 deals were with german 
firms 
the game is played in germany so its only natural the 
germans play the greatest role he said 
foreign hotel chains were interested in building in many places 
he said but that brought up the awkward problem of land ownership 
we dont know if we own this corner in east berlin or a jewish 
family that was expelled in 1938 
in dresden 130 miles south of berlin a long street of grimy 
factories contains two examples of treuhands work 
pentacon a company that made praktica cameras without regard 
for costs to show that east germany could build an internationally 
accepted product is closing and about 5000 people will be out of 
work 
cigarettes however are a thriving business philip morris 
bought the dresden factories of the old east german tobacco company 
and is turning out 50 million cigarettes a day 
it has guaranteed the jobs of all 945 workers through 1992 
increased production 30 percent and raised wages 100 a month to an 
average 1050 still less than half what the company pays its 
workers in western germany

conservative bluster notwithstanding theres 
little prospect of a major uprising on the republican right against 
president bush in 1992 but that wont stop the conservatives from 
making the threat 
there may ultimately be a challenge but it would be a protest 
move by a token candidate not a meaningful campaign against bushs 
renomination 
to do more rebellious conservatives would have to come up with 
a credible candidate and a galvanizing issue neither is in sight 
despite their anger that bush swallowed his central 1988 campaign 
pledge and agreed to a tax increase 
the president has reinstated his nonewtax pledge saying hed 
block any future increases with vetoes it aint gonna happen 
ill guarantee you he said after the congressional elections 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater says the presidents agenda 
is backed by the vast majority of republican conservatives 
but bush never has been a conservative favorite despite eight 
years as loyal lieutenant to president reagan conservatives 
accepted him grudgingly as reagans vice presidential nominee in 
1980 
eight years later conservative activists wanted another 
candidate but there wasnt much they could do about bushs 
promotion to the top of the republican ticket there will be less 
they can do about it in 1992 and fewer to try 
the threats of a challenge come from conservative organizations 
and interest groups not from elected republicans those activists 
would have trouble lining up a credible candidate to carry their 
protest in gop primaries or a thirdparty campaign 
among the names that turn up as potential challengers patrick 
j buchanan the conservative columnist and television commentator 
pat robertson the television evangelist and pete du pont the 
former governor of delaware robertson and du pont were in the 
field bush beat in 1988 
but bush has powerful conservative allies 
william j bennett his choice to become chairman of the 
republican national committee will be defending the administration 
in the buildup toward 1992 he was backing bush anyhow but the 
outgoing drug policy chief is too outspoken to have avoided a burst 
of political criticism now and then from a conservative think tank 
where he originally was headed 
jack kemp an ardent foe of the tax increase says hes in the 
bush cabinet to stay for as long as the president wants him the 
secretary of housing and urban development a 1988 presidential 
candidate says that despite the difference on taxes i never 
ever offered to quit 
lacking names to run with disenchanted conservatives at this 
point seem to be concentrating on names they want run out of the 
administration beginning with richard g darman the budget 
director 
darmans disregard and contempt for conservatives and 
conservative ideas is no secret said david a keene chairman of 
the american conservative union which has urged a staff overhaul 
beginning with the budget director 
there is speculation that darman might be leaving after the new 
bush budget is ready to go to congress early in february 
and bushs state of the union message will include promises and 
proposals to conservative liking he is sure to repeat his revived 
pledge against taxes and he is expected to concentrate on 
empowerment domestic programs intended to strengthen the role 
of the individual 
moves like those would take away targets for the revolt that one 
conservative theorist claims is almost certain if bush and his 
most senior white house aides continue to repudiate the reagan 
legacy as they have done in the past year 
burton yale pines senior vice president of the heritage 
foundation said conservatives should organize a posse to rescue 
george bush 
if he doesnt want to be rescued then we go a step further 
into opposition he said theodore roosevelt did that when he ran 
against his chosen successor president william howard taft in 
1912 
but ronald reagan isnt available for the roosevelt role hes 
had two terms and besides he supports bush with no open signs of 
disenchantment 
a more likely parallel would be with the 1972 campaign of the 
late rep john m ashbrook the ohio conservative who ran a token 
race against president nixon he never got more than 11 percent of 
the vote in a primary in two primaries he finished third far 
behind a liberal republican congressman who campaigned against the 
vietnam war 
reagan ran against president ford in 1976 who narrowly held the 
gop nomination then lost the election but that wasnt a protest 
it was an allout campaign against an unelected president 
open opposition gives conservatives a chance to escape being 
unjustly tainted by the bush administration pines said and 
open opposition gives conservatives a vehicle for their message 
 
the vehicle would have to be fueled with votes in 1992 enough 
of them to demonstrate significant dissent on the right otherwise 
a conservative revolt could wind up sending a message of weakness

every year a few lobstermen find a freak 
when they haul in their traps a lobster with a shell as blue as 
the maine sky 
and theyll often call sam chapman the godfather of blue 
lobsters in maine he has about 400 ranging in hue from powder 
blue to electric cobalt blue to a blue so dark its almost 
black 
most lobsters plucked from the atlantics icy waters are a 
mottled mixture of green red and brown they turn bright red when 
theyre cooked 
blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustaceans 
blue gene is dominant about one in every 3 million or 4 million 
lobsters caught along the maine coast is blue chapman said 
lobsters have genes for the production of red yellow and 
blue said chapman an aquaculture specialist at the university 
of maines darling marine center if the gene for red and the 
gene for yellow arent functioning you get a blue lobster 
the disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells red 
shells and even yellow with black spots known as calico lobsters 
chapman has been raising blue lobsters since 1982 in a study to 
determine if maines fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters 
raised in hatcheries 
hatcheries have operated in maine off and on for decades but 
chapman said no one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters 
increases the number of lobsters in the ocean 
part of the problem is that hatcheryraised lobsters are 
released when theyre the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for 
later identification 
so with the blue lobster chapman said what you have is 
essentially a colored tag 
you can do all of the plot sampling and research that you 
want but the proof of the pudding in this whole program is how 
many blue lobsters show up in traps over the next five years he 
said 
it took from 1982 when he collected amanda and vinnie the 
first two blues he bred until the summer of 1988 to raise enough 
blue lobsters to get started 
in june and july 1988 chapman and another university of maine 
researcher released 5600 blue lobsters off boothbay harbor in 
1989 they sampled the area and found two blues but sampling this 
past summer turned up none 
chapman released 1100 blue lobsters in pemaquid harbor this 
past summer and 1500 in cutler harbor 
he thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor 
because pemaquid and cutler are sheltered harbors my feeling is 
somewhere between three and four years after you let them go 
theyll start showing up in traps chapman said 
he also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing 
theyre living in rows of cages in his laboratory each 2 years 
old 3 to 4 inches long and bright blue 
in addition chapman has older larger blues that have been 
donated over the years by lobstermen he fetched two for a 
photographer a 1rsqb pounder that is 8 years old and a 2 pounder 
that is about 10 years old 
an obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same 
rate as regular lobsters do what we need to know is do they behave 
the same when theyre introduced to the ocean bottom he said 
to answer those questions he has begun studies to see how blue 
lobsters behave when introduced to different environments with and 
without the presence of predators 
david dow a former lobsterman and executive director of the 
maine lobster institute at the university of maine thinks 
chapmans work could be important for the future of the industry 
we dont know how long our production is going to last he 
said ten years down the road we might not have as large a 
supply or 10 years down the road if we do our homework and expand 
our markets we might want to increase our supply 
anthony dagostino director of the montauk marine science 
institute on long island said chapmans project seemed 
worthwhile 
i just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly 
said dagostino who has been studying lobsters since 1975 
chapmans funding is slight he started with 7000 from the 
lobster advisory council and keeps going with a yearly stipend of 
about 600 from the maine lobstermens association 
for all chapmans work however he cant answer the key 
question on every lobsterlovers mind do blues taste the same 
everyone asks that question chapman said the problem is 
weve never had enough to be able to eat any so i dont know ive 
never eaten a blue lobster

the lefthanded craftsman who lived 
9000 years before christ may have left his tools hanging from a 
tree branch and died before he could collect them 
or the tools may have been buried for later recovery or as part 
of a ritual either way evidence of the unknown craftsmans talent 
now lies exposed in the wet earth of an east wenatchee apple 
orchard 
we have a real master at work there chief archaeologist 
michael gramly said 
the excavation of 11200yearold stone and bone tools will help 
shed light on clovis people north americas earliest human 
inhabitants he said 
but the dig came up against indian protests over a possible 
grave desecration a tentative settlement has allowed digging of 17 
objects including a 9inchlong stone spear or knife point 
thats the largest clovis point thats ever been found said 
gramly of the museum of science in buffalo ny its probably a 
knife 
the volunteer crew of 25 includes dc waldorf of branson mo 
one of the nations leading experts and practitioners of the art of 
chipping stones into points called flint knapping the skill is in 
reading the texture of the stone so that the striking does not 
break it waldorf said 
by looking at the largest clovis point waldorf can deduce the 
maker was lefthanded with about 10 years of experience which 
would place him in his late 30s 
clovis points were used only the 500 years ending about 11000 
years ago the base of each point was notched or grooved to make it 
easier to fasten to spear shafts the clovis people were believed 
to be the first humans to appear south of the ice barriers at the 
end of the last ice age 
because of the size of the cache scientists have speculated 
that the tools may have been in a leather bag the owner left and 
then failed to recover but more likely is that the site was a 
ritual place perhaps for initiation or religious ceremonies and 
the objects were deliberately buried gramly said 
it could be a burial site although gramly said there is no sign 
of that 
a fear of disturbing ancestral bones prompted members of the 
colville confederated indian tribes to protest at the site the 
tribe also extracted a promise from gramly that he would remove 
only the 17 objects already exposed and stop digging immediately 
if human remains were found 
gramlys compromise was something of a surprise because he has a 
permit to dig up anything he wants and because sonic testing has 
revealed other buried objects 
weve never had anything like this in archaeology in the 
us said james burnes director of field operations for 
earthwatch of watertown mass earthwatch recruits volunteers to 
participate in digs and sent people on 140 digs last year burnes 
said 
temporarily lost in the controversy was the importance of the 
site itself which was discovered in 1987 by workers digging an 
irrigation ditch 
scientists say it is the first clovis site found relatively 
undisturbed clovis remains are named for a town in new mexico 
where they were first identified in the 1930s 
gramly has said the tools were likely left by people who came 
over a land bridge from asia and were among the first human 
inhabitants of the continent 
scientists agree he said that it is pointless to try to 
connect any current people such as the colville tribe to remains 
more than 4000 years old 
i took that as gospel he said obviously it is not gospel 
to the colvilles 
tribal religious leaders told gramly their legends have them 
arising directly out of the north american earth and that their 
oral history dates to the clovis era 
some people not all believe we came over the land bridge 
that is a falsehood tribal elder and religious leader moses 
george said we grew up here out of the ground 
although gramly has insisted there is no evidence this is a 
burial site there are some inconsistencies including gramlys own 
past speculation that it could be a burial site 
peter mehringer of washington state university who led a 
oneweek dig at the site in 1988 also reported to the state last 
year that human remains might be found 
in 1989 letters to the owners of the orchard and artifacts mack 
and susan richey university of arizona clovis expert vance haynes 
wrote of great potential for human remains 
the most important aspect of your site is the potential for 
the first understanding of what the clovis people were like 
morphologically haynes wrote most physical anthropologists 
would guess they were mongoloid but there are a few who would 
consider the possibility of their being caucasoid the latter would 
be big news 
gramly said the only clovis site ever to yield human remains was 
the anzick site near wilsall mont discovered in 1968 
fragmentary remains of two children were found 
the east wenatchee site has so far yielded about 30 stone 
pieces including 14 finished spear points more interesting is a 
collection of tools such as axes likely made from the bones of 
extinct animals gramly said 
and any new excavation is at least a year away as the interested 
parties try to agree on a plan for a dig

imagine leaning back in a chair amid the buzz 
of the office and hearing only silence 
the secret is in the chair headrest which has speakers on each 
side that duplicate a sound wave of the repetitive background noise 
then create the exact opposite 
the meeting of the waves cancels the noise 
you dont know what the background noise is then you hear 
this wonderful silence said wayne swann director of technology 
liaison at the university of maryland 
the speakers dont affect the ability to hear conversation or 
music they just eliminate annoying hums and other background 
sounds 
the chair sits in the offices of noise cancellation technologies 
inc as an example of the potential for the new silencing 
technology 
the company in linthicum is one of about a halfdozen 
worldwide that are racing to apply electronics and digital 
microcomputer technology to make quiet headphones noisecanceling 
mufflers and nonvibrating engine mounts the technology also 
reduces engine noise that permeates airplane cabins and car 
interiors 
the increased interest in reducing noise comes as more and more 
workers and companies are becoming aware of the dangers of noise 
pollution the national institutes of health says more than 10 
million americans have suffered hearing loss from noise exposure 
steve tretter a university of maryland professor created a 
mathematical formula that noise cancellation technology has applied 
to computer circuitry to reduce noise from several sources at the 
same time 
the first experiment with sound canceling noise came in 1936 
but it was not until rapid advances in digital electronics and 
microcomputer circuitry in the mid1970s that the field took off 
the technology was being applied to headphones and to prototype 
mufflers by the end of the 1980s 
the technology right now is running very very quickly 
faster than any technology that ive ever been associated with 
said tom hesse president of active noise and vibration 
technologies inc in phoenix 
the linthicum company and hesses company have developed 
prototype noisecanceling mufflers and are working with muffler 
manufacturers 
a speaker in a car exhaust system can silence engine noise as 
well as or better than a muffler can said eldon ziegler president 
of general systems at noise cancellation technology 
ziegler and hesse say the new mufflers will increase engine 
efficiency and reduce gas mileage because mufflers now drag on the 
engine to decrease exhaust noise ziegler predicts the new mufflers 
will be on some cars by 1994 
another company digisonix of stoughton wis is focusing on 
reducing noise from industrial smokestacks fans and machinery 
bose corp of framingham mass began manufacturing soundreducing 
headphones for pilots in 1988 
were talking about reducing or eliminating redundant noises 
in offices airplanes even swann said you dont notice them 
but they can affect irritability stress levels

the purchase of entertainment giant mca inc should 
help matsushita electric industrial co shake off its conservative 
ways and weather the sluggish consumer electronics market until the 
next popular product arrives analysts say 
archrival sony corp learned the importance of software 
the industrys name for prerecorded videotapes records or compact 
discs when its beta format lost a battle for videocassette 
supremacy to matsushitas vhs 
with sales of vcrs flattening out matsushita has followed 
sonys lead in purchasing a hollywood studio and record company to 
acquire the software rights to music recordings a film library and 
future movie releases 
some americans have expressed concern that matsushitas 66 
billion purchase of mca could affect the us compnys policies 
although most analysts say they expect little change but the deal 
could have a much wider impact on traditionbound matsushita 
the purchase marks a dramatic shift for osakabased matsushita 
which for years prided itself in not taking risks 
theyve taken a step away from being a conservative company 
and now will have to see where it takes them said mike jeremy 
an analyst for baring securities but perhaps they havent put a 
lot of thought into what they will do next 
sony learned from its beta defeat that it could no longer 
singlehandedly persuade consumers to try innovative technologies 
it joined with other companies to set standards for new electronic 
hardware such as 8millimeter video and digital audiotape 
recorders in part to encourage the development of more software 
with televisions or radios consumers could simply buy a set and 
turn it on but new products that depend on software wont sell 
unless it is readily available 
sony was successful in launching compact disc players in japan 
for instance because it could start selling cds immediately 
through its japanese cbssony subsidiary 
without that it might have been a really hard sell to get an 
independent record company to invest millions of dollars in a new 
plant and start producing a product for which there was no market 
yet said one industry official who asked not to be identified 
both matsushita and sony depend on video equipment which 
accounted for about 266 percent of matsushitas sales last year 
with vcr sales leveling off the chief reason for matsushitas 
purchase of mca was to maintain momentum until the next major 
electronic product comes onto the market said colin mills a 
research analyst for wi carr in tokyo 
that next product is expected to be highdefinition television 
which will provide clearer images wider pictures and digital sound 
and require a new generation of software such as videocassettes 
and laser discs 
but that market wont amount to anything until into the 21st 
century theres got to be something else in the interim and 
thats likely to be video software for use on todays video 
systems the industry official said 
under the financial and philosophical leadership of konosuke 
matsushita who founded the company in 1918 and died last year at 
age 94 matsushita grew into the worlds biggest consumer 
electronics maker eschewing the acquisition of outside companies 
typically matsushita waited for other firms to develop new 
products and to create consumer demand before unleashing its 
powerful manufacturing might to take a share of the market through 
its 24000 japanese retail shops 
that earned matsushita the nickname maneshita or 
copycat from rivals who nevertheless respected the companys 
reputation for quality products sold under the popular brand names 
technics quasar and panasonic 
until a year ago they hadnt bought anything jeremy said 
because of the dullness of the company we never even had anyone 
following it on a regular basis sony was always the company that 
was the innovator 
but the electronics industry has changed and along with it 
sony and matsushita 
new matsushita president akio tanii is gearing up to take the 
company in another direction said an official at a competing 
electronics company who spoke on condition of anonymity theyre 
trying to create a leadingedge image and become a bigger player 
overseas 
but the bureaucracy and corporate inflexibility that were a part 
of founder matsushitas legacy are likely to slow the changes said 
mills 
its like a giant oil tanker tanii is pulling on the rudder 
but it will be about two miles down the road before it will start 
to take effect he said

in september 1986 trade ministers from more than 
100 countries assembled at an uruguayan seaside resort and vowed to 
develop a more open durable and viable international trading 
system 
in a meeting that begins monday in the chillier climes of 
brussels belgium prospects for a successful conclusion to the 
socalled uruguay round of trade negotiations look uncertain at 
best 
economists have warned that collapse of the talks would have 
huge implications 
according to us estimates a successful trade liberalization 
package would boost world economic output by 4 trillion over the 
next 10 years 
by contrast failure to reach agreement is likely to lead to an 
upsurge in protectionism inwardlooking trading blocs and damaging 
trade wars 
trade officials point out that third world and reformist eastern 
european countries would be hit first but the west would also 
suffer 
it will be difficult i think to generate the international 
cooperation that we need to deal with tomorrows problems if were 
at each others throats on economic and trade issues us trade 
representative carla hills has said 
ministers attending the fiveday brussels meeting will have 
before them a 391page document meant to serve as the basis of a 
uruguay round accord spanning 15 sectors of world trade 
the sectors range from traditionally protected areas like 
agriculture and textiles to others like trade in commercial 
services and patent protection 
but the draft final act is generously sprinkled with squre 
brackets indicating alternative and often conflicting policy 
options 
more seriously there is no negotiating text on three areas 
prompting one diplomat to call the document an unfinished 
symphony 
negotiators say that problems in two of these areas 
antidumping and traderelated investment measures will be 
difficult to solve but carry insufficient political weight to take 
center stage at brussels 
on antidumping western nations want tougher restrictions to 
prevent goods being sold on their markets at artificially low 
prices japan and its southeast asian neighbors say the west uses 
existing antidumping duties merely to protect highcost 
industries 
deadlock on investment measures is characterized by a 
northsouth split third world countries cite development reasons 
for keeping controls over foreign investment the united states is 
not convinced and says many such controls distort trade 
the third issue agricultural supports is the most explosive 
ministers at the 1986 meeting at punta del este uruguay 
managed to include farm subsidies on the agenda only after bitter 
resistance from france 
at a meeting in april 1989 governments agreed to substantial 
progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection 
but they remain divided over what this means in practice 
the european community has offered 30 percent cuts in internal 
support but no firm commitments on reducing export subsidies or 
import barriers the united states some latin american countries 
and some other agricultural exporters say this is not enough 
japan meanwhile is sitting quietly on the sidelines relieved 
that the international dispute has diverted attention from its own 
import ban on rice 
there is no sign of flexibility in the opposing viewpoints and 
the bush administration has repeated earlier warnings that it will 
walk away from the round of talks if there is no satisfactory deal 
on agriculture 
for its part the european community says washington must accept 
the overwhelming view that a planned accord to govern the 680 
billion service sector must contain a general nondiscrimination 
provision principles of most favored nation status now rule 
world trade 
developed and developing countries alike say more progress must 
be made toward the goal of cutting overall import tariffs by one 
third seven previous trade rounds helped cut duties on 
industrialized goods from postwar levels of about 40 percent to 
about 5 percent in developed countries 
arthur dunkel directorgeneral of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade that is sponsoring the talks has stressed the 
deadlock over the main issues must be overcome in the first hours 
or days of the meeting 
his view is echoed by a senior european community official who 
said that without a political breakthrough in the first two days of 
the meeting the chances of the talks succeeding would be less than 
5050 
the official said the community is not prepared to extend the 
december deadline for the talks

at next weeks international trade 
talks latin america hopes to pry open the gates of european 
countries to farm exports from this continent 
the countrys of latin america say the question of european farm 
subsidies is no 1 on their agenda for the talks beginning monday 
as part of the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade or gatt 
brazil argentina chile and other nations on the continent 
depend on agricultural exports to earn hard currency but officials 
say price supports by the european economic community are unfair 
competition 
brazil is in condition to compete with the production of these 
countries said celso amorim head of the commerce department of 
brazils foreign ministry but we have no chance if we also must 
compete with their treasuries 
brazil is the worlds no 2 soy producer after the united states 
and earned 3647 billion in sales of soy last year 
argentina could sell 25 percent more grain 15 billion worth 
if world export subsidies were abolished agriculture secretary 
felipe sola said 
chile bolivia and peru also have called for lower agricultural 
subsidies and tariffs by europe japan and the united states 
another important issue for latin america is a proposal to 
include patents or intellectual property rights in the gatt 
accord 
the united states has threatened to impose sanctions on 
argentine exports if buenos aires doesnt honor us pharmaceutical 
patents new governments in brazil and peru generally favor 
recognizing patents 
brazil and mexico are also pushing for the elimination of export 
quotas for textiles and clothing in industrial nations markets 
many latin countries are already voluntarily lowering their 
trade barriers 
for example mexico has reduced 4090 of its 4400 import 
tariffs from 100 percent to 20 percent or less since 1988 brazil 
bolivia and argentina have lowered tariffs while chile and 
colombia say they will accept cuts

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan can 
only do so much to ease the pain of oilprice problems from the 
persian gulf crisis analysts say 
he can cut interest rates a bit in hopes of stimulating the 
flagging economy but he and his fellow monetary policy makers must 
move cautiously for fear of fueling inflation and scaring foreign 
investors away from us securities they say 
greenspan delivered a double message to the house banking 
committee on wednesday he acknowledged the oil shock had pushed 
the economy into what he called a meaningful downturn 
at the same time he warned there is no policy initiative 
that can in the end prevent the cut in our standard of living 
that stems from higher prices for imported oil 
consumers and businesses forced to pay more for gasoline and 
fuel oil will have less to spend on other goods and services he 
said 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co inc a new 
york government securities dealer said the fed is in a bind 
in the past month it sought to pep up the economy by nudging 
shortterm interest rates down by half a percentage point and 
jones said it most likely will push them down an additional 
quarter point before christmas 
to do more however could fuel inflation already hit with the 
effects of higher oil prices by making us rates lower in 
comparison with foreign rates it would also discourage japanese 
and europeans from buying the treasury securities sold to finance 
the national debt 
greenspan came as close as a fed chairman can come in 
suggesting that we are in a recession but he also suggested the 
fed is going to be very cautious in responding to it jones said 
rep jim leach riowa suggested that now may be the best time 
to push down interest rates even if it caused some inflation 
because federal spending restrictions established in the recent 
budget deficit reduction agreement are blunting another source of 
inflation 
greenspan responded the best thing to do is to try to craft a 
very stable policy which creates an environment in the long run 
that is not inflationary 
by steering a middle course however the fed may end up with a 
combination of accelerating inflation and economic weakness 
called stagflation said economist allen sinai of the boston 
company who appeared after greenspan 
during previous oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 the us economy 
suffered from stagflationrecession rising inflation and rising 
unemployment summarized in extraordinarily high discomfort or 
misery index levels he said 
there is not much cushion for the federal reserve because of a 
recession that already was in place before the iraqi oil shock 
sinai said 
even if greenspan personally wanted to do more to stimulate the 
economy he faces another problem according to jones unusual 
dissension among fed policy makers 
the federal open market committee which meets eight times a 
year to craft monetary policy usually approves its directives 
unanimously or with perhaps one at most two dissenting votes 
but in its early october meeting the last for which minutes 
have been released to the public the committee approved its 
directive by only a 74 vote 
three of the dissenters objected to the directive which 
provided for an easier monetary policy if congress and president 
bush reached a budget agreement later in the month one dissenter 
wanted a more immediate relaxation of credit 
greenspan still has somewhat of a split to deal with jones 
said

apple growers filed a multimillion dollar 
lawsuit against the cbs program 60 minutes and a consumer 
group seeking compensation for sagging sales during a scare over 
the growth chemical alar 
the industry has estimated growers lost more than 100 million 
following the news programs feb 26 1989 release of a report 
entitled intolerable risk pesticides in our childrens food 
the report was done by the natural resources defense council 
which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit with cbs and the 
networks 60 minutes 
officials for the washingtonbased consumer group and the news 
show said wednbesday they stood by the alar report 
the report concluded that alar which is sprayed on trees to 
improve the appearance and shelf life of apples increased the 
cancer risk in children it criticized the environmental protection 
agency for failing to take into account the high consumption of 
fruit and fruit juices among children when it set chemical 
guidelines 
the report was hotly disputed at the time but sales and 
wholesale prices of apples plummeted some school districts 
temporarily pulled apples from lunchrooms signs appeared in 
grocery stores advertising alarfree apples 
alar the marketing name of the chemical daminozide was 
voluntarily removed from the market in october 1989 by uniroyal 
chemical co the epa banned it from all food uses in may 
the scare was felt most acutely in washington where more than 
60 percent of the nations supermarket apple crop is produced 
the classaction lawsuit filed wednesday in superior court seeks 
to represent the estimated 4700 growers of red apples in 
washington it seeks unspecified damages running to millions of 
dollars 
the lawsuit contends unfair business practices especially 
product disparagement caused apple growers to lose profits 
growers suffered economic losses as a direct result of false 
misleading scientifically unreliable statements of the 
defendants the lawsuit said 
the gain is for agriculture in general nationwide that we 
stop this misleading information by the media and scare tactics by 
environmental groups said burt chestnut a wenatchee apple 
grower who is a plaintiff we want the media to be responsible 
also named as defendants were fenton communications inc a 
washington dc public relations firm that planned the alar 
campaign for the consumer group and cbs affiliate stations kiro of 
seattle krem of spokane and kima of yakima all of which broadcast 
the 60 minutes show 
the lawsuit was brought in state court to take advantage of 
washingtons unfair business practices act which outlaws unfair or 
deceptive trade practices said the growers attorney jay sandlin 
steven berzon an attorney representing the natural resources 
defense council said the lawsuit could have a chilling effect on 
public activism 
beyond alar this suit threatened by a small group of 
washington growers raises fundamental issues of free speech and the 
right of citizens to petition the government on important questions 
of public policy berzon said 
we believe the broadcast highlighted an important public 
health matter said roy brunett spokesman for 60 minutes 
it was well researched and well documented and we expect a 
lawsuit to be dismissed

two professors financier carl icahn is 
threatening to nominate to the board of usx corp want to meet with 
chairman charles a corry but corry isnt rushing to accept the 
offer 
john pound of harvard university and ronald j gilson of 
stanford university requested the meeting nov 15 in a letter to 
corry who responded in a letter released wednesday 
i have difficulty understanding the purpose of having a 
meeting as you suggest corry wrote it is difficult to imagine 
that the views and demands of your committee would be any different 
than those of mr icahn 
corry said it was clear the two were acting as mr icahns 
agents he noted the five members of the usx shareholders 
enhancement committee are being paid by icahn who also would pay 
for a proxy fight 
according to the chairman the company has met many times with 
icahn and discussed his views at great length and in significant 
detail during the past four years 
icahn who with a 133 percent stake is usxs largest 
shareholder announced nov 14 he had formed the committee to 
represent shareholders who want to boost the price of usx stock by 
creating a separate steel unit 
he threatened to nominate the five committee members as 
directors at usxs next annual meeting in may unless the company 
quickly moves to restructure its steel business 
pound is director of the corporate voting research project at 
harvards john f kennedy school of government and gilson is a law 
professor 
icahn said he does not control the two although he paid each 
man 25000 in cash and usx stock he said he considers the 
payments to be campaign contributions in their efforts to be 
elected as directors 
they are completely independent of me they stand in general 
for what i stand for which is free elections icahn said 
icahn said he took exception to the usx chairmans letter and 
said corry is trying to make the committee a personal issue between 
himself and icahn 
pound said he will continue to attempt to arrange a meeting with

a recession the department wednesday revised personal consumption 
in the third quarter down from 36 percent in its initial report to

growing and the number of hours worked was shrinking

increase in september disposable income dropped 05 percent even 
more than the 04 percent decline a month earlier

the european community commission on 
thursday proposed developing a greenlabeling system for consumer 
goods that would denote products that are environmentally sound 
ec environment commissioner carlo ripa de meana said the 
proposal would put industries under pressure to make ecologically 
sound products 
he said a panel of scientists and other experts from the 12 ec 
states would identify which products could sport the label showing 
a daisy encircled by 12 stars 
the ec institution that would oversee the labeling scheme the 
european environmental agency does not yet exist however 
de meana told reporters ec states should agree quickly on where 
to locate the agency that will be discussed at a dec 1415 ec 
summit meeting in rome 
as immediate candidates for a green label de meana cited 
detergents paints varnishes and other products used in the 
building trade as well as washing machines and lawn mowers 
de meana said foodstuffs and drinks would eventually be 
candidates for green labels 
he said the awarding of such a label would depend on the 
products overall impact on the environment during their 
manufacture and use and after they had been discarded 
the labels would be issued based on uniform criteria to be 
applied to products made across the ec de meana said 
the green labeling plan would incorporate national programs in 
ec states either already in place or under study the ecwide 
project contains the necessary seeds to become the exclusive 
system of ecological labeling in the community

the japanese electronics giant that is buying 
mca inc reiterated thursday that it has no intention of trying to 
influence creativity at the entertainment conglomerate 
in a statement released in osaka japan matsushita electric 
industrial co said matsushita has no intention of becoming 
involved in decisions regarding the subject or content of creative 
products at mca 
the statement from president akio tanii came in response to 
reports questioning the impact of foreign ownership on mca and 
other movie studios owned by overseas companies 
there should be no misunderstanding of matsushitas position 
in this important area tanii said creative decisions for mca 
will be made by mca management 
both mca and matsushita said when they announced the 66 
billion buyout of mca on monday that mca would be operated 
independently 
meanwhile reports surfaced that the italian buyer of another 
hollywood studio also considered a bid for mca italian financier 
giancarlo parretti was reported to have expressed interest in mca 
just after the entertainment conglomerate was closing the sale to 
matsushita 
parrettis pathe communications corp labored to buy mgmua 
communication co for 13 billion earlier this month 
the financier who parceled off many of pathes and mgmuas 
assets to finance his purchase of mgmua presented the new offer 
to mca chairman lew r wasserman only hours after the matsushita 
deal was signed monday according to the news reports 
a representative for parretti told the new york times that the 
offer fell between an expression of interest and a formal bid 
there should be an incredible amount of skepticism about the 
validity of any of this said jeffrey logsdon a stock analyst 
with seidler amdec securities theres no bid

rupert murdochs news corp says it hopes to 
reach an agreement with bankers by early january on a new financing 
agreement that would defer repayment on about 5 billion in debt 
for the next three years 
the australianbased company has amassed a large debt by 
aggressively expanding internationally into newspapers book 
publishing movie and tv production television stations and 
magazines 
but unexpectedly slow assets sales economic weakness in britain 
and australia and a sluggish advertising market in the united 
states have made it tough to keep up with debt payments 
murdoch has met over the past few weeks with groups of bankers 
in australia europe and the united states to outline a proposal to 
consolidate some 65 billion in bank loans otherwise due by 
mid1993 
an executive source close to the news corp chief executive but 
speaking on condition of anonymity said thursday that murdoch made 
the proposal because principal payments are coming due that the 
company would have trouble paying 
under terms of the proposed package only 14 billion in bank 
loans would have to be repaid by december 1993 the executive said 
the company would then hope to renegotiate the remainder by early 
1994 he said 
in exchange for permitting the debt deferral the bankers would 
get higher rates of interest and other fees the company has also 
told the bankers it plans to sell about 1 billion in assets over 
the next two years 
as part of the refinancing proposal news corp would get a 600 
million bridge loan that would have to be repaid in mid1992 the 
bridge loan would give the company the ability to make interest 
payments meet business expenses and allow extra time to arrange 
asset sales 
we hope to have it finalized by the end of december or early 
january the executive source said he said he was hopeful the 
banks would go along but cautioned we are very much in the 
middle of the process 
news corp purchased the book publisher harper amp row 20th 
century fox film corp several television stations and triangle 
publications the owner of tv guide and the daily racing form in 
the past few years 
under its existing loan agreemnt news corp would have had to 
pay back 24 billion in both bank loans and public debt by next 
june another 14 billion by june 1992 and another 3 billion by 
june 1993 
the new agreement would require no repayments by next june 12 
billion including the bridge loan by june 1992 and another 800 
million by june 1993 with the chance for delaying the final payment 
until december 1993

specifications that met soviet requirements said steve freed a 
grain market analyst with dean witter reynolds inc

tax collectors start shaking a little more cash 
out of airline passengers and motorists this weekend 
but most people facing higher taxes in the skies dont seem to 
be rushing to buy tickets ahead of time perhaps because they are 
ignorant of the latest levy 
likewise taxdodging drivers dont appear to be lining up en 
masse at the nations service stations to top off one last tank at 
the old rate 
not that the new taxes are playing well among businesses that 
might catch some of the flack from consumers who will pay more to 
fly and drive or even to operate a motorboat 
travel agents have been urging air travelers to buy quickly and 
beat the tax that kicks in saturday 
but several said thursday that few customers seem aware of the 
25 percent increase in the federal tax imposed on air fares as part 
of the governments effort to trim the budget deficit by nearly 
500 billion over the next five years 
they have no idea on it said eric munro chief executive of 
uniglobe wideworld travel in san diego which has warned customers 
by phone to get tickets early the government is very sly about 
it they have not advertised it 
at travel professionals in st paul minn workers sent faxes 
and a newsletter to corporate customers advising them of the rise 
in the tax from 8 percent to 10 percent of the cost of a ticket 
there are a few companies that are buying their tickets ahead 
of time manager peggy siqveland said the leisure traveler 
isnt too affected i dont think too many people are aware of 
it 
the tax could become something of a windfall for the airlines 
however because many will choose to raise ticket prices to round 
numbers that will bring in a little extra money on top of the levy 
munro said 
instead of making it 32222 theyll make it 325 he said 
so youre looking at not only 2 percent but maybe 3 or 4 
percent 
the tax might not seem all that bad to travelers who have 
already absorbed three rounds of air fare increases totaling about 
15 percent the industry raised fares across the board after fuel 
prices shot up following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
i think people are more worried about the fuel increases 
siqveland said 
anyone who tries to avoid higher taxes in the air wont be able 
to do so by staying on the ground or getting in a boat unless they 
fill their gas tank quickly 
starting saturday drivers will pay as much as 51 cents more 
for each gallon of gasoline as the federal gasoline tax rises by 
that amount to a total of 141 cents a gallon 
servicestation owners dont have to pass along the taxes but 
they are expected to major oil companies said thursday they have 
no choice but to pass on the taxes and at least one expressed 
unhappiness about that 
a vice president at amoco corp robert j rauscher said the 
higher gasoline tax allows government at all levels to avoid 
resolving the underlying problem of overspending 
even though pump prices will rise the american automobile 
association doubts many if any motorists will fill up early to 
avoid paying 
i would hope people wouldnt run out and top off their 
tanks aaa spokesman jerry cheske said if everybody and im 
talking everybody went out and topped off their tanks that could 
cause a problem with a lot of stations and it could create a 
perception there is a problem with supply which is not the case 
in addition the taxes on other fuels also rise saturday the 
tax on diesel fuel for highway use for example will rise by 5 
cents to 201 cents a gallon while diesel used by trains will face 
a new 2cent tax

skittish dealings punctuated by nervousness over the middle east

recover from their worst levels late in the session analysts said

escalated in the middle east

traders were awaiting results of a united nations security 
council vote on a resolution authorizing the use of force to end 
iraqs occupation of kuwait analysts were puzzled by the interest

us persian gulf troops are finding christmas 
stockings stuffed with 10000 handheld video games 150000 
prerecorded music tapes 50000 free phone calls home 100000 
packets of koolaid one case of army boot polish and free 
instructions to avoid going bald in the desert heat 
corporate america is coming to town 
roughly 835 donors ranging from rjr nabisco to burger king to 
whamo to atampt have given millions of dollars in goods and services 
to troops assigned to operation desert shield says the defense 
logistics agency in alexandria va the defense department unit 
that is coordinating donations 
the last time we had something of this magnitude was in world 
war ii said lt col henry wyatt a defense department 
spokesman 
beneath their santa claus outfits though persian gulf 
giftgivers hope to reap the sort of benefits once reserved for 
worldclass events like the us olympics or the new york marathon 
the charitable outpouring means valuable positive publicity in 
an age when many americans tend to distrust expensive corporate 
advertising many of these donations were arranged by company 
marketing departments 
millions of readers will see the fact that atampt did something 
nice said greg farrell editor of adweeks eastern edition a 
trade publication everytime atampt is mentioned thats good 
public relations 
the approach got off to a rocky start for some companies in 
october atampt cut short its offer for us troops in saudia arabia 
to phone home for free after saudi communications officials 
complained their longdistance lines were clogged 
but atampt repeated its offer this thanksgiving letting slide 1 
million in free phone calls in an 8day operation that went more 
smoothly about 130000 calls were made in the first five days an 
atampt spokesman said 
similarly philip morris usa announced in october that it had 
donated 2 million cigarettes to the persian gulf forces but the 
move prompted a big outcry from health groups who said the 
corporation was trying to hook a new generation of smokers 
now philip morris has come back with a less controversial 
approach but its marketing value is less clear the tobacco and 
food conglomerate has sent overseas nearly 80000 holiday greeting 
cards outfitted with computer chips that can play back recorded 
messages from family members and friends 
that donation seems like less of a logical promotional fit 
said farrell 
not to be outdone by atampt us sprint teamed up with burger 
king in a promotion with 50 us radio stations that has folks 
reciting messages to soldiers over the air the messages will be 
recorded and shipped over to saudi arabia for broadcast to the 
troops a burger king spokeswoman said 
around 20000 or 100000 worth of blue purple red and orange 
frisbees left long beach calif in early november on a military 
ship bound for saudi arabia along with instructions on how to 
play ultimate frisbee and disc golf scheduled dispersal 
date christmas day 
theyll have to use their imagination for playing in the 
sand said frank kappler spokesman for kransco group companies 
whose whamo subsidiary makes the frisbees 
a decidedly unusual donation was planned by hair farming a 
pompano beach fla company that said it is shipping over 
instructions on how servicemen can keep their hair from falling out 
in the extreme desert heat 
another company kiwi brands in douglassville pa said it 
rushed off a case of black shoe polish to an army unit in 
desperate need because its mens boots were drying out in the 
heat 
kiwi which calls itself the largest producer of shoe care 
products in the united states said it previously sent a large 
shipment of shoe polish for distribution in saudi arabia

louisianapacific corp said thursday it 
would temporarily curtail production at many of its mills because 
of the slump in the housing market 
the record decline in the homebuilding market and sharply 
lower prices for building products have forced the company to 
curtail production at many plants for varying periods of time 
during the fourth quarter the forest products company said in a 
statement some of those curtailments may continue into the first 
quarter of 1991 
the company said fourthquarter earnings could be near or below 
the breakeven level because of the cutbacks and continued declines 
in the pulp division 
company spokesman barry lacter said officials had not decided 
which mills to close or how long they will be shut down 
in some instances its going to be a few days around the 
holidays and in other instances its going to be a number of 
weeks he said 
lacter said the furloughs would affect operations nationwide

corn and soybean futures prices leaped thursday 
on the chicago board of trade on new signs of soviet buying 
interest but wheat futures fell to new 13year lows under the 
weight of abundant world supplies 
on other commodity markets pork futures posted fresh losses 
cattle futures gained energy futures were mixed and precious 
metals were mixed 
in chicago corn futures settled unchanged to 4 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 225 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with january at 594 a 
bushel wheat was 3 cents lower to cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in december at 239 a bushel the lowest settlement 
of a nearterm wheat contract since mid1977 oats were cent to 
1 cents higher with december at 107 a bushel 
analysts said buying activity surged late in the session amid a 
flurry of rumors and reports that pointed toward an increased 
likelihood the united states will sell grain to the soviet union 
steve freed a grain market analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc said there were indications a us grain exporter had 
arranged shipment from a great lakes port to an ocean port for two 
cargoes of corn with specifications that met soviet requirements 
freed said the corn might represent grain the soviets previously 
purchased but had not yet received but even in that case he said 
the movement of corn could indicate the soviets were cleaning up 
their backlog to make way for new purchases 
speculation about the soviet union has dominated the grain 
markets this week moscow is seeking us food credits to buy about 
600000 metric tons of us corn and 12 million metric tons of 
wheat by the end of the year to fulfill a longterm grain 
agreement 
but the bush administration repeatedly has said it will not 
offer the credits unless the soviets formally liberalize their 
emigration policies 
crop prices opened lower in reaction to a washington post report 
that saudi arabia initially plans to lend the soviet union a 
maximum of 1 billion not 4 billion as reported previously by the 
soviet news agency tass 
crop futures had rallied wednesday partly on ideas the soviets 
would use the saudi loan to buy us grain agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said thursday he did not know how the soviets would 
spend the money 
pork futures finished sharply lower for the second straight day 
on the chicago mercantile exchange in line with lower cash hog 
prices and ideas that high slaughter rates will continue hog and 
pork belly prices rose from their session lows late in the session 
though prompting a rally in the neighboring cattle pits 
live cattle were 23 cent to 50 cent higher with december at 
7912 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 42 cent higher 
with january at 8777 cents a pound live hogs were 23 cent to 12 
cents lower with december at 5052 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 125 cents to 175 cents lower with february at 6640 
cents a pound 
crude oil futures ended modestly lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange after profittaking erased gains that had 
mounted during the session amid rising tensions in the iraqius 
standoff in the middle east 
light sweet crude oil settled 31 cents to 78 cents lower with 
january at 3291 a barrel heating oil was 57 cent lower to 81 
cent higher with december at 9352 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 38 cent lower to 60 cent higher with december at 
8337 cents a gallon natural gas was 8 cent to 15 cents lower 
with january at 249 per 1000 cubic feet 
fears of war in the persian gulf helped boost gold futures on 
new yorks commodity exchange but silver futures swung lower in 
lackluster trading 
gold finished 310 to 350 higher with december at 38890 a 
troy ounce silver was 32 cents to 4 cents lower with december at

a former philips industries inc executive 
accused of insider trading defended the sale of his stock thursday 
saying he had no inside information and was simply trying to 
protect himself from financial loss 
robert h brethen former vice chairman of philips testified on 
the fifth day of his civil trial in us district court 
the securities and exchange commission alleges he used 
nonpublic information to avoid 570000 in losses by selling about 
half his philips stock before a proposed buyout of philips 
collapsed for lack of financing

consulted with attorneys on the legality of selling his stock he 
said he was advised not to sell it if he thought he possessed 
inside information 
i felt that i had no inside information he said 
brethen said he authorized the sale after reading various 
financial publications and becoming concerned that the failure of 
an impending buyout of philips by merrill lynch capital partners 
could send the value of the stock plummeting 
i decided i would like to protect myself brethen said i 
was concerned that there was a possibility the buyout might not 
take place 
however he said he didnt know whether or not the buyout would 
be successful 
i had no information either way he said 
brethen said he expected the stock sale to be investigated by 
either the sec or the new york stock exchange he also said he had 
the stock sold under a street name to protect the privacy of 
his personal finances within the local community 
on wednesday an investment banker testified that information 
brethen had would have been important to an investor trying to 
decide what to do with philips stock 
charles davis an investment banker with whitman heffernan 
rhein amp co in new york said that the private information included 
sales forecasts an internal company memo about a 250000 expense 
and a conversation brethen allegedly had with philips chief

cbs inc stock climbed thursday for the third 
consecutive day after a published report said the company was 
considering a stock buyback 
the company said it had no comment on the report but its stock 
jumped 487 a share to 16575 in trading on the new york stock 
exchange that followed a 587 a share advance on wednesday and a 
225 rise on tuesday 
the media companys stock remains well below its high for the 
year of 206 a share however it has sunk over the past few months 
along with other media stocks which have fallen into disfavor as 
the economy and the advertising environment have soured 
cbs lost more ground in the past two weeks after announcing that 
it expected a loss for the fourth quarter and lower earnings in 
1991 
but the wall street journal reported thursday that people 
familiar with the proposal said cbs is considering a stock 
repurchase program 
the story said a socalled dutch auction is one share buyback 
option in a dutch auction a company states the number of shares 
it wants to buy in a specified period and gives a price range 
within which shareholders may tender their shares the company then 
selects a price in the range that will enable it to buy all the 
shares it needs 
that type of buyback might enable cbs to buy back part or all of 
the 8 percent stake held by the estate of the late cbs founder 
william s paley 
paleys shares are to be divided among his six children but may 
have to be sold to cover tax obligations 
cbs spokeswoman ann morfogen said the company had no comment on 
the report 
media analyst peter appert of the investment firm cj lawrence 
morgan grenfell said a stock repurchase would be one of the more 
logical uses of their cash flow given the lack of other appealing 
investment opportunities 
cbs raised about 3 billion in cash through the sale in recent 
years of its records music publishing toys and magazine 
divisions 
but appert said the stock buyback is not the only reason cbs 
stock has done well this week 
media and entertainment stocks have generally risen in the wake 
of the 66 billion buyout agreement for mca inc the takeover bid 
by japans matsushita electric industrial co triggered speculation 
about combinations involving other media companies one rumor that 
has circulated periodically is that walt disney co may be 
interested in bidding for cbs 
in the earnings forecast nov 14 cbs said it expected to post a 
loss in the fourth quarter compared with earnings of about 60 
million in the same period a year ago because of losses at its cbs 
television network 
cbs has only posted one other quarterly loss from continuing 
operations in its history and that was 20 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1986 
the company also said it expects its earnings from continuing 
operations in 1991 will be down from this year because of a weak ad 
climate and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports 
rights

mcdonalds corp stock dropped more than 1 a 
share thursday after an analyst said the fastfood chain is 
considering permanent price cuts on most of its basic menu items 
mcdonalds disputed the report 
jack m greenberg mcdonalds chief financial officer said the 
oak brookbased company is testing a variety of value 
strategies in local markets but has not settled on a systemwide 
plan 
he said the report distributed late wednesday by analyst 
caroline levy of shearson lehman brothers inc was factually 
inaccurate ms levy was reported to be out of her office 
thursday and did not return telephone calls 
mcdonalds shares fell 112 to close at 28 on the new york 
stock exchange 
mcdonalds is seeking ways to stimulate domestic sales which 
have been slowing steadily since 1988 its stock price has fallen 
more than 20 percent since late july when the company announced 
us sales that were lower than many market analysts expected 
most analysts believe mcdonalds will announce price cuts early 
next year on selected items as the wendys hamburger chain has 
done but they said acrosstheboard discounts such as those used 
at the taco bell chain would cut too deeply into mcdonalds 
profits 
theyre going to want to reduce prices permanently on items 
that can still stimulate additional sales of other items said 
analyst leslie steppel of prudentialbache securities inc 
you might see them roll back prices on hamburgers but id be 
surprised if they roll back prices on soft drinks and french 
fries 
she said mcdonalds has been selling hamburgers for 49 cents and 
cheeseburgers for 59 cents in kansas city in one test of new 
pricing strategies 
greenberg said a new price strategy could include meal 
combinations it could include some price adjustments 
but he stressed that whatever changes mcdonalds makes will not 
be temporary discounts and will be done with an expectation of 
improved profits

the european community on thursday 
imposed penalties known as antidumping duties on us and japanese 
imports of aspartame an artificial sweetener used in soft drinks 
and food 
the ec commission said nutrasweet co the us exporter 
charged less than half in europe for its product than in the united 
states causing material injury to holland sweetener co the 
ecs only aspartame maker 
it imposed a duty of 2755 european currency units or about 
38 on each kilogram nutrasweet imports into the 12nation ec and 
of 2995 ecus or 4130 on aspartame from japans ajinomoto co 
the two companies jointly market aspartame in europe through a 
swiss venture called nutrasweet ag jan bergman president of 
nutrasweet ag protested the antidumping duties as unwarranted and 
unfair 
this is the highest duty ever imposed by the commission on a 
food product he said in a statement it will cause an 
immediate and dramatic increase in the cost of aspartame to ec food 
and beverage manufacturers 
we are shocked he said we do not understand the basis 
for the commissions determination and we will meet with members of 
the commission at their earliest opportunity to clarify their 
position and register our concern 
the duties stem from an ec investigation begun in march 3 into 
the prices nutrasweet and ajinomoto charge in the ec after a 
complaint by the dutch rival 
although the ec producer increased its sales and market share 
from nothing when it entered the market in 1988 it was faced by 
price undercutting by the us and japanese exporters the 
commission said in a statement 
unless measures were taken the community would be entirely 
dependent on one source of supply ie the imports from japan and 
the usa 
holland sweetener co general manager winfried vermijs said 
aspartame costs up to 70 a kilo in the ec and about 150 in the 
united states 
in a statement issued by his office in maastricht he welcomed 
the ec duties as good news for the european but also the us 
food industry for the move by the commission guarantees the 
presence in the aspartame market of more than one supplier now and 
in the future 
the ec commission acknowledged its duties will raise prices for 
consumers but said it was in the ecsgeneral interest to 
maintain the presence of a community industry in this important 
product 
nutrasweet co part of monsantos gd searle division has a 
monopoly on aspartame in the united states where its patent on the 
product expires in 1992 dumping refers to the practice by 
exporters of selling goods on foreign markets at unreasonably low 
prices to gain a significant market share in those markets or sell 
off excess production 
the ec calculated the duty on ajinomoto co based on 
nutrasweets prices as the japanese exporter refused to provide 
essential information on its domestic prices and costs 
holland sweetener co and nutrasweet are the biggest providers 
of aspartame in the ec where annual consumption is about 1000 
tons compared with 6000 to 7000 tons in the united states 
aspartames sweetening power far exceeds that of sugar and has 
made rapid inroads in recent years as an ingredient in light soft 
drinks

where it closed at 13325 yen as investors sought a safe haven in 
anticipation of the un decision 
jumpei ishii a foreign exchange dealer at the mitsui taiyo kobe 
bank said the dollar was staying close to its new york finish in 
the absence of fresh marketdriving forces he said investors were 
generally not taking big risks this late in the year 
the lower yen and possibility of war in the middle east helped 
push share prices down on the tokyo stock market said a dealer at 
cosmo securities who spoke on condition of anonymity

has hit below the 22000point level

burdened by too many sheep and too much 
wool australias wool industry the worlds largest exporter is 
preparing a controversial program to do something about it 
starting next week the industry says it will kill 10 percent of 
the nations sheep under a plan that has provoked damaging 
publicity 
most of the old underweight and poor woolproducing sheep will 
be shot and buried in mass graves in farmers fields across the 
country 
the 31billionayear industry says the slaughter is needed 
because it is producing twice as much wool as it can sell and is 
saddled with 20 million excess sheep 
the australian wool corp concerned with its image around the 
world has hired a public relations firm to ensure that the 
correct story is told about the slaughter 
high interest rates a sharp downturn in demand for wool and a 
weak market for mutton have combined to put the industry in 
trouble 
even its live sheep exports to middle east countries have been 
plagued with problems the most recent when a shipment was refused 
by saudi arabian authorities this week because of disease 
in addition nearly three years after the wool growers were 
given the right to set the price of their product there are calls 
for the debtladen and depressed industry to lose the privilege
