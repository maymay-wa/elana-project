confidence monday in parliament on key elements of a broadcasting 
bill that has split the dominant christian democrat party 
by a vote of 35834 in the chamber of deputies andreottis 
newly shuffled fiveparty coalition passed its second confidence 
vote in three days 
the opposition communists and three small leftist parties 
boycotted the session charging the government with trying to force 
through the bill 
the yearold government sought the confidence vote to ensure 
passage of a series of amendments to the legislation which would 
regulate state and private television the amendments include norms 
for commercials and antitrust provisions limiting ownership of tv 
stations and newspapers 
the bill has been in the making for 10 years 
last week five ministers from andreottis christian democrat 
party resigned over the bill however andreotti quickly replaced 
the ministers who were members of a rival party wing headed by 
former premier ciriaco de mita 
a final vote on the entire bill is scheduled for the chamber of 
deputies on tuesday if passed it will then go to the senate for 
action by the end of the week before parliament goes into summer

as new hampshires attorney general in 1976 
supreme court nominee david souter submitted a brief in which the 
state argued against paying for medicaid abortions and referred to 
abortion as the killing of unborn children 
in an earlier case argued in 1972 when souter was the states 
deputy attorney general new hampshire defended its strict 
antiabortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing 
the maintenance of an unborn childs right to birth is a 
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an 
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life 
in both cases the briefs apparently were written by other men 
and the extent of souters personal involvement is unclear and 
from neither one argued before and one after the us supreme 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion is it 
possible to determine his personal views on abortion an issue 
likely to play a major role in his september confirmation hearings 
new hampshires attorney general is appointed by the governor 
and by law represents him and other state officials in court cases 
the states governor when both abortion cases were argued was 
meldrim thomson a conservative abortion foe 
abortionrights supporters expressed unease with mondays 
development just days after antiabortion activists showed dismay 
that souter had been on the board of a new hampshire hospital and 
at a meeting when it voted to allow abortions at the facility 
senators on both sides of the abortion issue have promised to 
raise the subject during souters september confirmation hearings 
souter is due back in washington on tuesday for more meetings with 
senators who will consider his nomination to succeed retired 
justice william j brennan a strong supporter of abortion rights 
souters involvement with the briefs even if tangential could 
provide a way for members of the senate judiciary committee to 
raise the abortion issue without asking him questions about how he 
would rule on specific cases 
clearly the senate should ask judge souter to address himself 
to this document at his confirmation hearings said arthur j 
kropp president of the liberal group people for the american way 
kropp whose organization on monday released copies of new 
hampshires filings in the 1976 case said the language in them 
suggests a clear sympathy for an antiabortion viewpoint 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said the use of rhetoric commonly used by 
antichoice extremists is profoundly alarming she called anew 
for tough questions on the abortion issue during confirmation 
hearings 
at the white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said he 
did not know if bush had been told about the 1976 case whats 
important is the president supports his nominee hart said 
bush in remarks to the youth leadership coalition did not 
address the issue saying merely of his selection of souter i am 
very happy with the way the choice has been received across the 
country it is moving in the proper direction and i probably 
wont have too much more to say about it 
in the 1976 case several pregnant women receiving medicaid help 
challenged a new state regulation in which the state said it would 
not pay for abortions unless a womans life was at risk the case 
was first filed in 1975 when souter was top deputy to warren 
rudman souter became attorney general in 1976 when rudman went 
into private practice rudman a republican was elected to the 
senate in 1980 
a federal district court had ordered new hampshire to pay for 
medicaid abortions pending the outcome of the case but the state 
appealed that injunction to the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
in boston the court on which souter now sits 
the 1976 brief was filed in souters name but signed by a 
deputy richard v wiebusch then an assistant attorney general it 
acknowledged that the 1973 roe v wade decision prohibited states 
from outlawing abortion but said nothing in the ruling or the 
legislation creating the medicaid program blocked the state from 
refusing to pay for abortions 
many thousands of new hampshire residents find the use of tax 
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally 
repugnant new hampshire argued in the brief asking the appeals 
court to void the injunction 
wiebusch now in private practice did not return a telephone 
call to his manchester nh office he was quoted in tuesday 
editions of the new york times as saying the language in the 
briefs is all mine i dont remember having any discussions with 
david about the case 
he said he was reaching for the most colorful most 
highprofile language to win my case and does not know souters 
views on abortion 
in another brief in the 1976 case that also carried souters 
name but was signed by wiebusch new hampshire argued that congress 
did not adopt the medicaid program to aid in the destruction of 
fetuses 
the supreme court in 1977 ruled that states have no legal 
obligation to pay for abortions of women on welfare if their lives 
were not endangered by their pregnancies the court in 1980 upheld 
the hyde amendment which barred spending federal money for most 
welfare abortions 
in the 1972 case argued before the new hampshire supreme court 
just prior to the us supreme courts roe vs wade ruling the 
state defended its 1848 antiabortion law by asserting family 
privacy and personal convenience can never take precedence over the 
right to live 
elsewhere in the brief on file with the court in concord the 
state argued 
without the right not to be destroyed by abortion all the 
rights of a fetus would be worthless indeed without the power to 
protect life itself of what use all the other duties and functions 
of the state 
souter was rudmans top aide at the time and several attorneys 
who worked in the office then said it was customary for souter the 
offices acknowledged top legal mind to review positions the state 
planned to take in major cases 
but his name does not appear on any of the briefs in the case 
and howard b myers the assistant attorney general who wrote the 
briefs and argued the case before the new hampshire high court 
said he did not recall ever discussing the merits of the case with 
souter

the former mayor and two former council members of 
the city of sweetwater were sentenced to prison terms monday for 
using their public positions to extort money from a local 
businessman on a zoning matter 
us attorney dexter lehtinen alleged in january that five of 
seven members of the council in the small city in western dade 
county participated in the scheme 
former council member carmen menendez 51 was sentenced to 33 
months with two years of probation by us district judge edward b 
davis after her conviction on counts of conspiracy and extortion 
former mayor irain gonzalez 49 and former councilman antonio 
duran 49 each were sentenced to 27 months in prison to be 
followed by a twoyear probation after their conviction on a 
conspiracy count 
the three could have faced a maximum of 40 years in prison and a 
fine of 500000 
two council members hugo alvarez and lucio cobian entered 
guilty pleas earlier and were scheduled to be sentenced wednesday 
the sweetwater officials were suspended from office by gov bob 
martinez following their indictment on jan 25 
the three sentenced monday were convicted by a federal jury 
before judge davis on may 29 attorneys for all three defendants 
said they would appeal the convictions and sentences 
the indictment stemmed from a request made by maurice barakat in 
june 1989 asking the council to lift a landuse restriction 
barakat who owns the holiday plaza shopping center had sold part 
of the land which left him with less than the five acres necessary 
for commercial zoning 
barakat asked the city council to remove the restriction so he 
could sell the additional commercial units more easily the 
indictment said the defendants allegedly told barakat he would 
have to pay them 10000 in exchange for a favorable council vote 
on his request 
instead barakat went to the fbi 
the councilmen voted to continue delaying action on barakats 
request until he paid the money the indictment alleged barakat 
paid menendez 5000 with fbi agents watching but then was asked 
to pay 6000 more according to the indictment 
sweetwater known in the 1960s as a rural outpost in western 
dade county has recently become a haven for political exiles from 
central america

there are few secrets nowadays at 
conventional arms negotiations between nato and the warsaw pact 
where backslapping camaraderie has displaced the icy atmosphere of 
the cold war 
rapid changes that have reshaped eastern europe and are 
fragmenting the warsaw pact have created anomalies at the 
negotiating table that were unthinkable a year ago 
take the east germans for instance once the soviets most 
formidable military allies they have been pushed to the sidelines 
by approaching german unification 
nobody takes them seriously said a delegate of another 
warsaw pact country 
a senior nato negotiator who spoke on condition his name not be 
used said his east german counterpart doesnt get any 
instructions and doesnt write any reports i feel sorry for him 
negotiators for the two military alliances who avoided each 
other just a few years ago now lunch together and as independent 
thinking supplants bloc loyalties the seven warsaw pact and 16 
nato countries happily enlist each others help against their 
allies 
nobody is worried that the friendship is because someone is 
trying to recruit someone else as a spy said a warsaw pact 
delegate in other words i dont see the cia in a western 
delegate and he doesnt see the kgb in me 
we very often conspire together with western colleagues to 
accomplish something that other warsaw pact countries oppose 
said a senior hungarian negotiator who also commented on condition 
he not be identified 
if the more flexible nato countries want to propose something 
but nato discipline wont allow it then they ask us to do it 
such thinking was nonexistent at the mutual and balanced force 
reduction talks which broke up without a treaty last year after 16 
years of frustration stonewalling and posturing by both sides 
deadlocks on troop strengths and verification of troop and 
weapons cuts among other issues proved insurmountable in the 
climate of distrust generated by superpower confrontation 
enter the conventional forces in europe talks now going on in 
vienna 
a child of perestroika in the soviet union and the resulting 
lessening of eastwest tensions they have been marked by an 
atmosphere of cautious trust from the outset 
but the ice wasnt broken until the wave of democratization 
swept autocratic communist rule from most east european capitals 
that heralded the beginning of the end for the warsaw pact 
hungary which served notice earlier in the year it is leaving the 
east bloc alliance by 1992 recently signed a deal to provide nato 
troops with meat and cold cuts 
other members are bound to leave soon as well and although the 
pact has said it is changing from a military to a political 
alliance to conform to new realities most members agree its days 
are numbered 
nowhere is that more evident than at the these talks most 
participants whether from nato or the warsaw pact now share one 
overriding goal rid europe of as many soviet troops as possible 
the superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195000 troops each 
in central europe with the united states permitted to station up 
to 30000 soldiers elsewhere in europe 
the desire of both sides to shrink the soviet troop presence 
from the atlantic to the urals appears a prime reason for keeping 
the talks going even as the warsaw pact unravels 
nobody wants to upset the present structures on which the 
negotiations are based said a warsaw pact delegate this would 
give the soviets a prime excuse to leave the negotiations and we 
dont want to do them that favor 
a western delegate agreed 
the primary interest of every nation but one at the talks is 
to effect some kind of reduction of soviet forces he said 
its nato against the soviet union with the nonsoviet warsaw 
pact countries playing the gobetweens

portofspain trinidad ap prime minister arthur robinson 
offered sunday to resign and call early elections if black moslem 
rebels free him and about 30 other hostages and end their coup 
attempt an official said 
at least 27 people have reportedly been killed in the violence 
however there was no official toll 
robinson apparently made his offer as he and other government 
officials remained wired to explosives and threatened with death 
they were taken captive friday when several hundred rebels with 
automatic weapons seized control of broadcast buildings and the 
parliament 
government radio said the rebels were optimistic about reaching 
a settlement with robinson but that they also wanted immunity from 
prosecution 
however energy minister herbert atwell appeared on national 
television late sunday with an official statement offering no hope 
for a quick settlement 
i am in no position to offer any hope that the situation will 
be resolved speedily andor amicably atwell said the 
situation in parliament remains a touchandgo one with relation to 
the hostages and their captors he added 
acting police commissioner leonard taylor announced during the 
same broadcast that joint police and military patrols had been 
dispatched to control widespread looting along the 25milelong 
corridor from the capital to its international airport and outlying 
communities 
a journalist who was inside the parliament building when it was 
stormed said sunday the rebels shot robinson in the leg and also 
shot in the leg the minister of justice selwyn richardson the two 
were being treated by minister of health emmanuel husin a medical 
doctor who was in the building 
the journalist released by the rebels saturday night spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
staterun radio 610 said nolli clarke an anglican priest was 
assisting in the negotiations at the parliament hundreds of 
government troops were patrolling around the building 
coup leader abu bakr a former policeman in his mid40s claims 
robinsons government is corrupt and undemocratic he said on 
television friday that the coup was intended to stop poverty and 
the destruction of trinidad and tobago a caribbean nation with 
high unemployment and skyrocketing food prices 
as negotiations continued sunday the portofspain area was 
beset by fires scattered shooting and widespread looting in some 
areas 
hundreds of looters ransacked stores and factories in several 
eastern suburbs making off with food refrigerators videocassette 
recorders and television sets some loaded their cars with stolen 
goods and drove off 
looters also hit the fivesquareblock downtown shopping 
district where damage and losses were estimated at 50 million 
radio 610 reported it did not say how the figure was calculated 
anglican bishop clive abdullah broadcast an appeal for the 
looting to stop 
my heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter 
places to take foodstuffs i can perhaps ask gods forgiveness for 
this he said but when you line up a convoy of vehicles to 
take away items like refrigerators television sets and videos 
that is not right 
a spokeswoman for president bush who was in kennebunkport 
maine said saturday that he was following the situation 
carefully and that american citizens and tourists on trinidad and 
tobago did not appear to be in danger 
a government curfew imposed saturday by a state of emergency 
that mobilized the countrys 5000member army and 1500member 
police force was extended sunday to 18 hours from 6 pm to noon 
some of the 11 americans staying at the harborside holiday inn 
three blocks from the parliament building said they were more bored 
as a result of the curfew restrictions than afraid of the violence 
unfortunately i came at the wrong time theres nothing to 
do the hotel is nice but i didnt come here to sit inside a hotel 
doing nothing said rhonda isaacs a native of guyana now living 
in new york city 
ms isaacs said her two children 11 and 13 have been spending 
their time swimming in the hotel pool or watching television the 
family had intended to return home from a threeweek vacation on 
aug 9 but now wanted to leave as soon as possible she said 
radio 610 said scores of people had been injured in fighting 
associated with the coup the red cross urgently appealed for blood 
donations to treat the wounded but most residents were too afraid 
to leave their homes 
an administrator at the portauspain general hospital said at 
least five people wounded during the overthrow attempt died sunday 
the caribbean news agency quoting police and hospital sources 
said on saturday that at least 22 people have died in fighting 
since the coup attempt began but exactly where the fighting 
occurred remained unclear 
the offer robinson reportedly made to the rebels was described 
by jones madeira director of the government television station and 
himself a hostage 
madeira said in a telephone interview from a television station 
seized by the rebels that robinson agreed to turn over power to an 
interim government that would rule until elections are held in 
three months 
robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide and 
the next elections were not scheduled until 1991 
my information is that prime minister robinson has agreed to 
step down and that an interim government of major political parties 
will run the country until elections are held in 90 days he said 
the rebels were holding robinson with several cabinet ministers 
in the red house madeira said he and 30 other employees were being 
held at the television station which is several miles north of the 
parliament known as red house 
he said 10 other people were inside of radio trinidad in a 
building near the tv station but it was unclear if they were being 
held captive as reported earlier or whether they were staying 
inside because of snipers 
bakr heads a group of about 250 black moslems called jamaat 
almuslimeen which means the moslem group in arabic 
bakr lives in canada for several years in the early 1980s where 
he took up islam and worked for a while with the canadian 
broadcasting corp he returned to trinidad in 1984 said haroon 
salamat head of the toronto and region islamic congregation 
bakrs group had formed its own paramilitary squad to raid known 
drug dealers salamat said 
salamat told the toronto star that he thinks the coup attempt 
resulted from years and years of frustration and government 
harassment 
all of this drugs and social justice has concerned him 
because he saw the government just ignore the problems he must 
have thought that drastic action was necessary 
moslems most of them east indians make up about 6 percent of 
the population of 13 million people of the caribbean nation off 
venezuela 
the general population is mainly hindu and christian and is 
about 40 percent east indian and 40 percent of african descent 
trinidad and tobago a former british colony suffered serious 
economic decline in the 1980s as the world price for oil the main 
export plummeted 
unemployment is estimated at around 22 percent and food prices 
have skyrocketed by about 25 percent in the past year 
on saturday roman catholic archbishop anthony pantin talked 
with bakr by telephone afterward pantin quoted bakr as saying the 
prime minister and the hostages at the parliament building are 
wired up with explosives pantin said the rebels threatened to 
blow up the captives if government troops move on the building

niels nielsen has rappelled down the old 
man of the mountain for 30 years to protect the crumbling granite 
silhouette from the ravages of nature and man 
but last week on his 63rd birthday nielsen slipped and fell 
he wasnt hurt but decided to make it his last trip to the 
40foottall human profile carved by nature in new hampshires 
white mountains 
since 1960 nielsen has tried to maintain the face by doing such 
things as scraping algae binding splits and diverting water next 
year the youngest of nielsens four sons takes over 
my father kept asking me to come and it became one of the few 
things he and i had in common said david nielsen 32 
nielsen began caring for the old man while working for the state 
highway department since then hes made sure the face didnt go a 
year without maintenance 
you might say i pushed for it he said i didnt want to 
see it come down 
the state paid for equipment and rented a helicopter to land 
nielsen above the old man so he could rappel down nielsen retired 
from the department two years ago when he began to work for free 
with help from state parks workers 
im not a mountain climber im a mountain hanger said 
nielsen who lives in plymouth 30 miles south of franconia 
the first recorded sighting of the old man was in 1805 by 
construction workers who thought it resembled thomas jefferson the 
orator daniel webster said of it god almighty has hung out a 
sign that in new hampshire he makes men 
the author nathaniel hawthorne visited the old man in 1832 and 
wrote it seemed as if an enormous giant or a titan had 
sculptured his own likeness on the precipice the vast lips 
if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunder accents 
from one end of the valley to the other 
today the old man is broken and humbled by time 
the shifting of the earth on cannon mountain is splitting its 
neanderthal forehead and weakening its adams apple acid rain has 
burned its face so badly that the granite crumbles in nielsens 
hands 
last week nielsen killed algae on the old mans face with 
bleach to prepare it for an application of acid retardant 
he is not the first to care for the old man 
in 1906 a methodist minister the rev guy roberts was 
climbing over the face and discovered its forehead was sliding 
roberts spent nine years looking for someone to help repair the 
profile 
in 1915 he met ed geddes a quarry superintendent from quincy 
mass who a year later climbed the cliffs and bolstered the 
forehead with steel buckles but a short time later the forehead 
began splitting 
in 1937 geddes then 74 and other volunteers carried concrete 
a mile up the cliffs in backpacks to fill the gap in 1958 state 
workers strengthened geddes buckles 
david nielsens wife deborah climbed to the old man on one of 
their first dates now she is the old man archivist recording 
measurements of the old man and the names of its helpers for a 
yearly report 
nielsen hopes his 11yearold grandson tommy will continue the 
tradition though the boy has not yet scaled the face

at a housing project where gunfire drug dealers 
and murders are commonplace children play a spooky game of crime 
scene the way other youngsters play house 
they mimic shootouts play dead and act out the role of 
detectives cordoning off an area with tape or examining a victim 
they swap stories of those they know who got taken out of here 
at the walt whitman and ingersoll housing project the game 
became real for a 3yearold who was sleeping on a sofa bed in his 
familys apartment when he was shot to death 
ben williams was hit in the head by a bullet fired through the 
front door he was the third child reported killed by a stray 
bullet in new york city in a week 
bens 7yearold cousin barry taylor has been unable to sleep 
since the shooting hes still thinking about it said his 
mother belinda lewis 
outsiders should put themselves in our shoes for 10 minutes 
said zuleka pass one of 30000 people living in the project in 
fort greene a crimeridden section of brooklyn 
they should know how it feels to watch your childrens pencils 
shake when they try to do their homework with the sound of gunshots 
outside she said 
mrs pass said the killing exposed the fear that residents feel 
every day 
when i hear a shot go off right away we roll onto the floor 
she said you never know when its going to come into your house 
those stray bullets have no name

around the projects grounds he underwent two months of plastic 
surgery for his head wound his right hand no longer functions

several hours after his halfbrother had an argument behind the 
building where the family lived 
mrs pass said many of the projects youths consider jail and 
handcuffs a badge of honor that will earn respect from their peers 
so no one bothers them 
as for weapons mrs passs 18yearold daughter aisha said 
most youths arent afraid to use them because theyre not afraid to 
die 
its not like they would die for a cause or something like 
that she said theyd die over where they sell drugs over

mayor ed gray is tired of his town 
being made a laughingstock over ufo sightings he considers a hoax 
but some merchants are cashing in on the controversy 
tourism is looking up thanks to a series of reported ufo 
spottings since 1988 merchants are churning out ufo books jewelry 
and tshirts picturing a beachgoing alien catching some rays 
from a flying saucer 
gray isnt laughing 
i have a real moral problem with my city being couched as a 
ufo phenomenon when its not he said in a recent interview 
gulf breeze in the florida panhandle made tabloid history in 
1988 when ed walters a local builder reported the first sightings 
and produced photographs he claimed were of ufos 
he also told of being lifted off the ground by a beam of blue 
light from a flying saucer and getting a visit from 
spanishspeaking extraterrestrials who talked about bananas he and 
his wife frances even wrote a book about it called the gulf 
breeze sightings 
interest in the towns own brand of upward mobility waned until 
recently 
first the mutual ufo network a ufo research organization held 
its annual symposium in neighboring pensacola from july 68 the 
threeday event attracted 600 people 
then six us soldiers were arrested july 13 in the gulf breeze 
area after slipping away from their army intelligence unit in west 
germany a friend of one of the soldiers who were discharged last 
week for desertion said they went to gulf breeze because they 
believed the end of the world was near and jesus would return in a 
spaceship 
the two events generated plenty of publicity the miami herald 
labeled gulf breeze americas flying saucer spaceport crews 
from the television programs unsolved mysteries a current 
affair and inside edition were here last week to do ufo shows 
gray agreed to be interviewed on each show 
the general feedback is its time somebody told it like it is 
and defended the city said gray who is a banker 
some business owners think the ufo flap is good for the beach 
town of 6200 because it has brought untold free publicity and 
attracted tourists 
sheilah bowman director of tourism and convention development 
for the pensacola area chamber of commerce said ufo tour groups 
are being arranged 
gulf breeze travel agent linda belcher who handled 600 plane 
tickets for the ufo symposium also said the publicity has been 
beneficial 
it brought in a lot of money to the gulf breeze merchants when 
they desperately needed it she said 
among souvenirs on sale are 13995 14 caratgold necklaces 
depicting a spaceship 4895 spaceship watches and tshirts 
depicting a flying saucer over gulf breeze and the words 
extraterrestrial tourist

alberto fujimori began his presidency by 
firing the commanders of the navy and the air force and announcing 
banks would be closed today and tuesday to stop a run on the 
institutions 
at a news conference sunday he would not discuss the dismissals 
or details of the drastic measures he has promised to try to end 
perus economic crisis 
the president does not have to give explanations fujimori 
told reporters on his first full day in office 
analysts said the dismissals probably were part of an effort to 
impose authority over the military and in line with fujimoris 
promise to fight corruption 
fujimori said he would not give details of his economic plans 
about which there is great apprehension until thursday or friday 
at the earliest 
the economy is in collapse annual inflation tops 3000 percent 
four of five people lack steady work and the government is bankrupt 
fujimori has said he will cut price subsidies raise taxes and 
privatize many stateowned companies he also has said he would 
devalue perus inti to raise the dollars cost by 300 percent to 
400 percent 
last week many banks ran out of money leaving thousands of 
workers unable to cash their checks drivers formed blockslong 
gasoline lines and bread disappeared from poorer neighbohoods 
store shelves are often halfempty because merchants withhold 
supplies in expectation of higher prices 
on sunday fujimori reiterated his intention to renew payments 
to the international monetary fund cut off in 1986 by his 
predecessor in office alan garcia of perus 20 billion foreign 
debt some 1 billion is owed to the imf 
the new president also said this south american country of 22 
million people needs at least 700 million in emergency aid in 
coming months to feed and care for its poor 
peru is in the midst of its worse drought this century many 
crops have been nearly destroyed and urban water supplies have been 
drastically cut leading to widespread disease 
economic aid is also key to fighting drug trafficking in peru 
fujimori told reporters coca leaf the raw material of cocaine is 
perus top export bringing in 1 billion annually 
we must be realistic a military solution alone wont work 
fujimori said peruvians who make a living off the coca trade must 
be offered an alternative way to make money he said 
the 52yearold agronomist who is of japanese descent won a 
landslide election victory june 10 over acclaimed novelist mario 
vargas llosa 
it was fujimoris first campaign for office and there were 
strong rumors the military was plotting a coup if he won the 
military overthrew a civilian government in 1968 and ruled the 
country until 1980 
fujimori denied sunday that there exists any discontent in the 
armed forces after firing gen german vucetich and adm alfonso 
panizo 
panizo criticized his dismissal in a statement to the newspaper 
la republica the fired navy chief said such a change in military 
leadership had never occurred along with a change in government 
vucetich did not speak to the press the outgoing air force 
commander ahd been accused of corruption earlier this year by cesar 
hildebrandt a top television newsman hildebrandt later accused 
vucetich of trying to frighten him into keeping quiet 
in his inaugural address fujimori said he would fight 
government corruption and political analysts said vucetichs 
firing was probably part of that campaign 
panizo probably was fired because he was slow in denying the 
coup rumors the analysts said panizo was reassigned to a position 
in washington 
fujimori has given the military a prominent role in his 
government three ministries defense interior and fisheries 
will be led by military officers 
analysts say the strong military presence probably signals a 
tougher stance against perus two guerrilla insurgencies the most 
dangerous of which is the maoistinspired shining path 
more than 19000 people have died in 10 years of political 
violence in peru

a 27yearold cook and fitness 
instructor was pulled today from the ruins of a hotel that 
collapsed 14 days ago in an earthquake he is among the longest 
survivors of a quake on record 
pedrito dy was rescued about 345 am from the wreckage of the 
hyatt hotel in baguio a mountain resort 130 miles to the north he 
was the third person found alive at the hyatt since friday when a 
man and a woman were rescued 
dy was flown to manila where doctors said he was suffering from 
dehydration and low blood sugar dr raul morena said dy survived 
because he was athletic and suffered no serious injuries in the 
july 16 quake 
i drank my urine sometimes drops of rainwater dy said when 
he arrived in manila 
i caught water with my mouth and scooped urine with the palm 
of my hand for 13 days i was telling myself i would die and then 
i cried for help 
dy whose eyes appeared glazed and whose face showed little 
emotion said he became so despondent that he tried to commit 
suicide by banging his head against the debris 
in a voice barely audible dy said i prayed constantly to the 
virgin mary and gave my life up to the lord then i wasnt scared 
anymore 
morena said dy was disoriented because of low blood sugar but 
that he was responding to treatment he was examined at manilas 
makati medical center 
dy said he was among 12 people trapped in the basement of the 
hotel wing used to house employees but all the others had died 
more than 50 people including 12 americans of filipino origin 
are still believed buried beneath the hyatt 
the july 16 earthquake measured 77 on the richter scale it 
left at least 1653 people dead 1000 missing and presumed dead 
3000 seriously injured and 110000 homeless 
foreign rescue teams in baguio abandoned the search for more 
survivors more than a week ago because they said sensor instruments 
indicated there were no more people alive in the ruins of eight 
hotels that collapsed in the quake 
but filipino crews many of them miners and other volunteers 
continued the search there was renewed optimism after two 
survivors were pulled from the rubble of the hyatt on friday where 
they had been trapped for 11 days 
the two luisa mallorca 20 and arnel calabia 26 were 
reported in good condition and were flown sunday from baguio to 
manila for medical treatment 
experts say it is unlikely that anyone can survive buried under 
rubble for more than about a week without food and water 
baguio which is about a mile above sea level has been 
experiencing unusually heavy rains in recent days which cooled the 
area and apparently provided enough water to sustain survivors 
when a powerful earthquake struck san francisco on oct 21 
1989 rescuers pulled an oakland longshoreman buck helm from his 
car 89 hours afterward he he died 28 days after his rescue 
the most celebrated survivors of a mexico city earthquake in 
september 1985 were the miracle babies found in the rubble of 
two maternity hospitals the newborns survived periods of 
entombment of up to nine days 
dy said he had finished his shift as a hotel cook and had gone 
to the basement to work out in the gym with fellow employees the 
force of the tremor hurled him against an exercise cushion hanging 
against a wall which collapsed on him 
the cushion shielded him from falling debris he said dy said 
he found a metal tube in the rubble which he used to tap out 
distress calls 
before they left british investigators said they heard tapping 
sounds from the basement but the tapping ceased and they 
abandoned the search because they thought the victim had died it 
was unclear whether someone else was also tapping signals 
dy said he was aware of the passage of time because a clock in 
the gym was undamaged and continued to strike daily at noon and 
midnight 
officials said dys wife and son peter art were in la union 
province which suffered extensive damage in the quake it was 
unknown whether they would be brought to manila

the dollar fell sharply against the japanese yen 
monday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange continued to 
decline 
the dollar closed at 14860 down 215 yen from fridays close 
of 15075 yen after opening at 14910 yen the currency moved in a 
range of 1485514920 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average fell 42053 points or 136 
percent to close at 3044295 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities 
co said the dollar opened lower following declines abroad linked 
to a us announcement friday that us gross national product was 
not increasing as fast as expected 
kouhei kuroda a dealer with fuji bank added that the tokyo 
market was also reacting to a fall in the sydney market in which 
the us currency declined as far as the 14845yen level 
but the dollar was bought up again by dealers wishing to cover 
their short or oversold positions kuroda said and afterwards 
the dollar hovered around 149 yen with sale orders nearly matching 
buy orders 
the weakness of the nikkei average and the increase in oil 
prices are making it difficult to continue buying the yen kuroda 
said 
on the stock exchange the index fell on arbitrage sales of spot 
issues in exchange for purchases of index futures said kozo 
hasunuma of yamaichi securities co 
the decline was also accelerated by a thin trading volume and 
buying which concentrated on specific issues he said 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bond dropped to 8519 points as of 1115 am from its close friday 
at 8523 points its yield was posted at 7595 percent down from 
7585 percent

hospital 
gene gilliard of seneca sc was listed in critical but stable 
condition early today after receiving the lung said hall and

serious condition early today after receiving the liver and brenda 
strawbridge 34 of mount pleasant was in serious but stable

without electricity today in the wake of a power outage that led 
looters to ransack more than a dozen grocery and liquor stores on 
the citys west side 
police said they arrested 49 people on lootingrelated charges 
after a generating plant fire knocked out power to 40000 customers 
late saturday night

who cautioned that it was a rough estimate 
three people died early sunday in a fire started by candles they 
were using to light their home authorities said

blackout there was no riot there was no heavy looting

coalburning plant on the west side said john hogan another 
commonwealth edison spokesman the resulting blaze knocked out the 
cables that route power to most of the west side

papers that were videotaped by a british journalist the documents 
also describe efforts by a noriega aide to mediate discussions 
about commercial and diplomatic ties between israel and cuba

by the joint debriefing center of the us armys 470th military 
intelligence brigade following the dec 20 invasion the herald 
reported in its sunday editions 
captured panamanian officers told us interrogators that 
noriega never expected a fullscale invasion until dec 17 when he 
obtained telephone intercepts and intelligence reports indicating 
an assault was imminent

us marine assigned to the us embassy in panama to his mother in 
the states us troops later found a transcript of the 
conversation at the headquarters of panamas military intelligence

someone shouted theres a bum in the 
bathroom 
by the time the passengers shout in the back of a greyhound bus 
was repeated down the aisle and reached the front it sounded to 
the driver like a bomb in bathroom 
so the driver charles boyer slammed on the brakes and 
passengers scrambled for the door as boyer waved to a state trooper 
for help 
before things got straightened out police closed the highways 
southbound lanes for about two hours stalling traffic for 15 
miles investigators searched the bus with a bombsniffing dog as 
the passengers who had been herded along the median strip watched 
from a quartermile away 
just one of those things said trooper gregory taylor after 
piecing together the details 
taylor was on foot watching traffic for an interstate 95 
construction crew just north of route 32 in savage in central 
maryland when he noticed the greyhound bus the driver waving out 
the window to me as he pulled over near the barrier 
the passengers started pouring off i thought maybe somebody 
was on there with an uzi or something taylor said 
then he heard talk of a bomb and saw fingers pointing at the 
man from the bathroom who had bailed out with the others 
taylor said he handcuffed the suspect who declined to answer 
questions and called for help after about 45 minutes of talking 
with passengers officials suspected that a mistake had been made 
taylor said 
but out of an abundance of caution they kept searching for a 
bomb 
the bus headed for a stop in silver spring was back on its way 
shortly before 230 pm 
taylor said the accused stowaway oliver martin a 61yearold 
homeless man from philadelphia had boarded in baltimore 
he was charged with misdemeanor theft for allegedly trying to 
avoid the price of a ticket between the two points 8 
he had 35 cents in his pocket taylor said all he wanted 
to do was go for a ride somewhere

the nations toughest state abortion law 
will be tested in federal court this week in what could be the 
first step on the road to the us supreme court 
only guams abortion law is more restrictive than 
pennsylvanias which was scheduled to go before senior us 
district judge daniel h huyett iii today one of the two laws is 
expected to give the nations highest court an opportunity to 
reconsider the decision that legalized abortion roe vs wade 
the significance of it is the race to the supreme court 
said kathryn kolbert of the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project whichever one gets there first 
raises the question for the court to reevaluate roe 
in a hearing expected to last most of the week huyett will hear 
arguments on whether legislation passed in 1988 and 1989 illegally 
restricts the rights of pregnant women and their doctors to obtain 
or to perform abortions 
contested provisions include those that require married women to 
inform their husbands before they can obtain abortions and that 
generally ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy 
other sections are similar to some the us supreme court 
declared unconstitutional in a 1986 pennsylvania case those 
provisions 
obligate doctors to provide pregnant women with information 
regarding fetal development and their rights to obtain child 
support 
require a 24hour waiting period between a womans visit to a 
doctor and the performance of the abortion 
make information available to the public from reports required 
from places that perform abortions 
kolbert and other opponents say the law interferes with the 
ability of doctors to follow accepted treatment and counseling 
standards invites uneven law enforcement and the harassment of 
abortion clinics and staffers forces families to make decisions 
contrary to their moral judgments and imposes reproductive choices 
on women but not on men 
but robert r gentzel a spokesman for the state attorney 
generals office said the commonwealth believes that there are 
indeed appropriate public policy reasons for all of the 
provisions 
he also maintained that the restrictions are permissible under 
existing supreme court rulings 
the pennsylvania law has been temporarily blocked by federal 
court order as has the law in guam a us territory in the 
pacific 
in the spring the guam legislature banned all abortions except 
when a womans life is endangered and outlawed all abortion 
referrals 
the us supreme courts 1973 decision in roe vs wade outlawed 
state regulation of abortions unless the regulations were clearly 
to safeguard the womans health 
the pennsylvania law is being challenged by planned parenthood 
of southeastern pennsylvania womens suburban clinic womens 
health services inc reproductive health and counseling center 
allentown womens center and dr thomas allen of allentown on 
behalf of all pennsylvania physicians who perform or make referrals 
for abortions 
defendants in the suit are gov robert p casey state secretary 
of health n mark richards and state attorney general ernie preate 
since 1980 when 65777 abortions were performed in the state 
the number has declined every year according to court documents 
in 1988 50786 abortions were performed

henry a strams neighbors know him as a 
friendly easygoing man with a passion for gun collecting 
but they were shocked at the extent of the arsenal found at his 
threestory duplex in a quiet neighborhood near cambridges central 
square 
a weekend raid at strams home yielded a huge weapons cache that 
packed more firepower than the citys entire police force 
authorities said 
nearly 200 handguns 300 rifles an antitank gun and at least 
one machine gun were confiscated saturday night by police and 
officials of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the weapons were seized from strams home after police responded 
to a report of a breakin which later proved erroneous and 
noticed firearms and fireworks said cambridge police lt richard 
bongiorno 
police obtained a warrant and for several hours saturday night 
carried out a supply of weapons which included antique guns 
mortar shells and gunpowder also seized were components to make 
machine guns bongiorno said 
more weapons were seized sunday 
police were seeking stram for possible weapons possession 
charges stram 50 was not home at the time of the raid and was 
believed to have been away for the weekend bongiorno said 
the weapons were estimated to be worth about 150000 bongiorno 
said 
we dont have an arsenal as large as what we seized there 
bongiorno said its very unusual to have one person with an 
arsenal of this size 
stram had no criminal record and had obtained and consistently 
reapplied for firearms licenses bongiorno said but even weapons 
that appeared to be legal were seized because police said the 
extent of the arsenal was a threat to public safety 
that amount of guns its unheard of said police lt donald 
carney especially in a house in the middle of the city if 
anyone broke in and took the guns it would wreak havoc on the 
streets 
authorities intended to file complaints today in middlesex third 
district court including felony counts for possessing a machine 
gun and misdemeanor charges for having illegal fireworks carney 
said 
neighbors described stram as a helpful and pleasant man who 
spoke openly of collecting guns and being a member of the national 
guard 
hes actually a very gentle man very talkative and helpful 
said david breen who lived in the other half of the duplex on 
chalk street he never hid the fact he was into collecting 
firearms he often talked about it 
but breen and other neighbors said they were shocked at the 
apparent extent of strams arsenal 
he was friendly he has always been really calm around here 
said jamie waller 29 who has lived next to stram for 23 years 
but if i had known he had so much in there i wouldnt have gone 
to sleep so easily at night 
bongiorno said police got a warrant to search strams home after 
responding to a report of a breakin friday night that report 
turned out to be wrong but officers spoke to a house sitter and 
observed fireworks and weapons in the home 
on saturday police once again responded to the home this time 
for a report of a man with a gun bongiorno said officers observed 
an illegal mortar at the residence prompting detectives to apply 
for the warrant 
breen said a family friend had driven by the house and become 
suspicious of a man entering the building and called police 
however breen said the man had been asked to take care of strams 
dogs

south korea today urged communist 
north korea for talks on a proposed opening of the heavily armed 
border between the two nations in august 
prime minister kang younghoon said in a message to his north 
korean colleague that a meeting must be held before aug 7 in order 
to allow the fiveday frontier opening which would start aug 13 
there isnt much time left for preparation the message 
said if your side truly wants to take part in the road toward 
peaceful uunification we hope you accept our epochal proposal 
there was no immediate rely from the north 
the two sides have not been able to agree on a date to discuss 
president roh taewoos proposal leading most observers to believe 
the border opening is unlikely 
north korea has essentially rejected the idea citing conditions 
unlikely to be met by seoul such as abolishing anticommunist 
laws releasing prisoners jailed for espousing unification and 
dismantling border barriers 
the defense ministry said today it would allow south korean 
civilians and foreign visitors to tour a restricted border area to 
see antitank barriers that the north has said are actually a 
berlintype wall ministry spokesman kim chiwook said the tours 
would begin aug 10 
the border between the koreas is the most heavily fortified in 
the world and has been tightly sealed since the peninsula was 
divided in 1945 no civilian crossings have been approved by either 
government since a 1985 family exchange program 
meanwhile north korea charged today that the united states and 
other third countries are meddling in korean affairs and standing 
in the way of improved relations between north and south korea 
without actually naming them the north also scolded its 
communist allies the soviet union and china indicating they 
were among those with an intent to obstruct reunification and 
freeze division 
north korea has been vehemently against moves by communist 
allies to seek ties with south korea the south has established 
diplomatic relations with every nation in east europe except 
albania and east germany 
the two koreas signed an accord july 26 agreeing to hold the 
first meetings of their prime ministers in seoul sept 47 with a 
second round of talks scheduled in north korea oct 1619

the communist party chairman and the 
leaders of several new opposition parties won legislative seats in 
mongolias first free elections opposition parties announced today 
the total number of seats won by each party was not available 
today the national election commission said it had not received 
reports from all districts and that it did not expect to announce 
complete results until wednesday 
the count from sundays election which added mongolia to the 
ranks of sovietbloc countries that are embracing democracy is 
being done by hand 
the communists in power since 1921 are being challenged by 
five new opposition parties born last winter and spring out of 
popular demonstrations all parties agree on the need for greater 
freedom and marketstyle economic reform but differ on the pace 
and boldness of change 
there will be quite enough supporters of democratic change 
in the new legislature to have an impact said sonomtserengiin 
mendsaikhan secretary of the opposition social democratic party 
we cannot say mongolia now is democratic but it has taken the 
first step toward democracy 
more than 90 percent of mongolias approximately 1 million 
eligible voters took part in the elections despite heavy rains that 
washed out roads in some parts of this central asian country 
voters selected candidates for the national provincial and 
local legislatures and on a separate ballot selected their 
favorite party 
the results of the party popularity poll will be used to 
allocate the 53 seats in the small hural which will meet between 
sessions of the 430seat great peoples hural and have considerable 
power 
the communists were guaranteed control of the great peoples 
hural because the new parties could not nominate candidates for all 
the seats in time 
its just a beginning said jargaal a member of the 
opposition social democratic party who was observing balloting at 
the gachuurt state farm outside ulan bator she said more time was 
needed for mongolians accustomed to a oneparty system to gain the 
courage to join another party 
the party of national progress which had candidates for 18 
seats said it won at least seven seats in races for the great 
hural 
but they lost a key race against communist party chairman 
gombojavyn ochirbat who took 51 percent of the vote in district 
12 narrowly defeated his noncommunist challenger ganbold a 
29yearold lawyer 
the opposition had made the ochirbat race a priority because of 
the symbolic importance of defeating the communist party leader 
the social democrats said they won at least five races lost 
two and had no information on 11 others the losers included party 
chairman batbayar 
the mongolian democratic party which reported it fielded 90 
candidates said it won at least 34 won seats zorig leader of the 
democratic partys affiliated mongolian democratic association won 
his race 
the communists have said they might invite noncommunists to sit 
on the cabinet mendsaikhan said his party would accept if asked 
election observers from opposition parties and foreign countries 
noted incidents of mishandling ballots but reported no major fraud 
however a delegation of observers from the washingtonbased 
international human rights law group noted that the nominating 
procedure favored the communists and that communists dominated the 
local election commissions 
entire families arrived by horse truck and car at gachuurts 
school a holiday atmosphere prevailed and the elderly wore their 
best clothes usually traditional herders costumes 
the communists known as the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party legalized opposition parties in april following mass 
demonstrations for democratic reform that were inspired by the 
ouster of communist governments in eastern europe 
a communist election victory would not necessarily indicate 
popular confidence in the party 
urban votes carry less weight than rural votes under the new 
election law skewing results in favor of the communists they are 
weakest in the cities where there is more knowledge of the outside 
world

damaged buildings was nearby at the time of the blast which was

secretary of state james a baker was ill in 
bed with a fever today but planned to continue his fournation 
asian tour as scheduled 
baker was checked by a doctor and will leave tuesday for 
mongolia and then siberia the last two legs of his trip state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said his illness was not 
immedately clear 
baker attended only the first hour of the asia pacific economic 
cooperation meeting at the oriental hotel the group includes the 
united states japan canada australia new zealand south korean 
and the six association of southeast asian nations comprising 
singapore indonesia the philippines brunei thailand and 
malaysia 
baker arrived sunday from jakarta where he attended the 
association of southeast asian nations annual meeting with its 
main trading partners 
his speech was delivered today by commerce secretary robert a 
mosbacher it said the united states sees the global economic 
outlook as generally favorable for economies in the asiapacific 
region 
growth in the industrial countries as a group will be lower 
than in 1988 and 1989 but it still should be close to 3 percent 
for 1990 and 1991 despite relatively slow us growth this year 
according to bakers speech 
the united states expects strong world trade growth with 
industrial nations continuing to provide a solid base for expansion 
by developing countries the prepared remarks said 
while the central and eastern european countries are engaged 
in a difficult transition to democratic marketoriented systems 
their reconstruction should be beneficial over the medium term for 
the global economy as well as for themselves he said 
but today the developing countries of southeast asia issued a 
strongly worded statement expressing fear they will be left out in 
the economic cold by rich industrial nations 
the statement said the association of southeast asian nations 
placed special emphasis on market access and viewed progress in 
that area as the gauge by which to measure the seriousness of 
developed countries in taking developing countries concerns into 
account 
the new asia pacific forum was suggested early last year by 
australia promoted strongly by baker and finally launched nine 
months ago in canberra australia but it still lacks a clearly 
defined format and has not decided whether china taiwan and hong 
kong will be allowed to join

a conservative party lawmaker and 
outspoken critic of the irish republican army was killed today by a 
bomb planted beneath his car police said 
ian gow died shortly after emergency services reached his home 
said inspector mike alderson of the sussex police 
no one immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell on 
the ira which killed a lawmaker in an explosion in 1984 and has 
carried out several bomb attacks in england recently 
it is reasonable to assume this was another ira device said 
george churchillcoleman commander of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad 
the ira is trying to end british rule of northern ireland and 
gow 53 was a highprofile target by virtue of his chairmanship of 
the northern ireland committee the parliamentary caucus discusses 
issues related to the province but has no power over legislation 
churchillcoleman said gow had been warned he was included in a 
list of onehundred lawmakers judges and civil servants found in 
an ira bomb factory in south london in december 1988 
it appeared that a device containing about five pounds of 
explosives had been placed underneath the drivers seat 
churchillcoleman said 
my impression is that it was some sort of tilt switch once 
you turn it on it explodes immediately he said 
police had initially reported the bomb exploded as gow drove the 
vehicle out of the carport at his home in hankham near eastbourne 
on the southeast coast but churchillcoleman said he doubted the 
car had moved much if at all 
last tuesday after an ira bomb killed three police officers and 
a nun in northern ireland gow expressed his disgust with ira 
tactics 
these murders are as odious as they are futile he said 
once again wives have been turned into widows and children into 
orphans and for what purpose 
gow was an ardent supporter of prime minister margaret thatcher 
and served as her parliamentary private secretary from 1979 to 
1983 but he resigned from a ministerial post in her government in 
1985 to protest the angloirish agreement which guaranteed ireland 
a say in the affairs of the province 
he had sharply criticized nelson mandela earlier this month 
after the african national congress vice president called on the 
british government to negotiate with the ira 
there is absolutely no way this or any other british 
government will negotiate or have discussions with the ira gow 
said 
mrs thatcher called gows death a grievous loss both to me 
personally to the parliamentary life of this country and to his 
constituency 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party called it 
a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offense was to speak 
his mind 
irish prime minister charles haughey said he disagreed with gow 
on irish issues but considered him a man of honor of integrity 
and of deep conviction 
ian geldard editor of the publication terror update said he 
believed gow would have been one of the iras leading targets 
because of his closeness to the prime minister and his 
outspokenness 
it would be easy for terrorists to get to him said gows 
neighbor jane birch there did not seem to be any obvious 
security the gate to the drive was often open they didnt seem to 
make any point of guarding the house 
the ira has exploded several bombs in england this year killing 
one person before today 
on may 16 sgt charles chapman was killed by an ira bomb 
outside a british army recruiting office in wembley north london 
and on june 1 british army pvt william davies was shot to death 
at lichfield railway station 
in the most recent attack no one was injured by an explosion at 
londons stock exchange on july 20 
on june 25 an ira bomb exploded at the carlton club in london 
injuring two men severely and nearly 20 people less seriously on 
june 21 an ira bomb destroyed a building at a royal air force base 
at stanmore northwest london on june 13 an ira bomb caused 
extensive damage to a home recently vacated by a former 
conservative party official 
an ira bomb killed a conservative parliamentarian and four other 
people on oct 12 1984 at the grand hotel in brighton where the 
party was holding a conference

the shooting of seven people at a murdered 
asian gang members burial likely will mean an escalation in the 
violent power struggle between new york citys vietnamese and 
chinese gangs authorities say 
it looks like its definitely going to spill over here 
linden police capt robert gerbounka said sunday theres no 
doubt in my mind that there will be retaliation 
at least three gunmen posing as mourners dropped flowers they 
were carrying and opened fire with uzi submachine guns saturday on 
about 100 mourners attending the burial of a vietnamese man who was 
shot to death last week 
seven people were wounded by gunfire and seven others were 
injured in the ensuing panic at rosedale memorial park in linden a 
suburb five miles southwest of newark 
police said they found signs that mourners most of them members 
of the vietnamese gang born to kill shot back at the attackers 
the new york times reported in todays editions 
more than 100 new york police officers patrolled manhattans 
chinatown section following the shooting to guard against violence 
between the gangs gerbounka said 
the man being buried 21yearold vinh vuv was shot four times 
in the chest wednesday in a driveby shooting in chinatown police 
said a man with him was wounded police said 
new york police said vuv operated a group known as the canal 
street boys one of several that make up born to kill a vietnamese 
gang with members in houston boston los angeles and other cities 
whats occurring in new york is these canal street boys have 
been doing a lot of extorting and robberies in the canal street 
section gerbounka said theyre getting chinese gangs angry at 
them theyve got the label of being a fringe gang which is one of 
the reasons theyre taking a beating right now 
the born to kill gang has been a force on canal street a 
chinatown thoroughfare for at least a year said gerald mckelvey 
a spokesman in the manhattan district attorneys office 
there have been organized gangs of one kind or another in 
chinatown for at least the past 15 years dominated by the ghost 
shadows and the flying dragons he said 
we began to see them put out of commission either because they 
killed each other off or were put in jail mckelvey said 
born to kill members have filled part of that void extorting 
money from shop owners and trafficking in heroin he said 
he declined to speculate on what may have touched off saturdays 
violence because the case is still under investigation

vandals painted swastikas and 
antisemitic slogans on some headstones in a jewish cemetery and 
smashed others over the weekend in what police said appeared the

traveling gang of supporters of the national front which advocates 
the expulsion of racial minorities from britain

two others within the last six weeks at edmonton in north london 
and in leeds yorkshire in the edmonton case the words we will 
rise again were painted on gravestones 
police estimated the damage at 128000 from the manchester 
vandalism which police said occurred late saturday or early 
sunday they did not disclose what the slogans were 
it is a terrible thing to think there are people who would do 
this to the resting places of the dead said rabbi jacob 
rubinstein in manchester 
we are extremely concerned to think that in light of what has 
happened to other cemeteries these people are crawling out from 
under stones again he said 
on saturday vandals in stuttgart west germany damaged more 
than 60 gravestones in a jewish cemetery and spraypainted them 
with nazi symbols 
more than 60 gravestones were desecrated police said nazi 
symbols and slogans like jews out and the gassing never 
happened were spraypainted on some stones they said

a gravesite for nazi victims in tuebingen about 30 miles south of 
stuttgart a similar attack occurred recently in carpentras in 
france 
in paris today police said about 30 graves were desecrated at a 
cemetery at a catholic church near southern toulouse graffiti at 
the cemetery which was not jewish included death to jesus 
and down with the clergy 
since the carpentras desecration in may there has been some 
sort of cemetery vandalism almost weekly in france much of it at

cigarette smuggling is dramatically increasing in 
china and authorities in coastal provinces seem unable to deal with 
the problem an official report said monday 
in the coastal province of fujian authorities handled 50000 
cases of the smuggling of imported cigarettes in the first half of 
this year four times higher than during the same period last 
year the economic daily said 
last year an estimated 600000 to 1 million cases of cigarettes 
were smuggled into china representing a tax loss of 190 million 
to 317 million it said 
most male chinese smoke and having imported cigarettes is 
considered a status symbol ordinary chinese cigarettes sell for 
about 20 cents imported cigarettes cost six to seven times that 
amount 
authorities from the tobacco monopoly bureau in eastern china 
said at a recent meeting that it was difficult to stop smuggling 
because of a lack of supervision in coastal provinces 
gangs some with links to hong kong and taiwan are increasingly 
active pushing out individuals who used to make up the bulk of the 
cigarette smuggling trade 
the new breed of smugglers are also well equipped for example 
they use 9001200 horsepower boats against the governments 40100 
horsepower crafts the paper said some foreign boats are even 
equipped with satellite navigation equipment and other 
communications facilities it said 
some authorities who confiscate smuggled cigarettes are also 
known to sell them rather than turning the goods over to the 
authorities the paper said

born as a tropical depression off northeast florida bertha grew 
quickly saturday into a minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph it 
dropped below the 74 mph hurricane threshold sunday night but 
regained hurricane status today after its winds intensified a bit 
at noon edt today bertha had top sustained winds near 75 mph 
and was centered near latitude 353 north longitude 674 west or 
675 miles southsouthwest of halifax nova scotia said forecasters

sent gusts up to about 45 mph toward bermuda 
but forecasters said that because it was already edging 
northeastward toward the open atlantic when it was born it was

game to help channel islands national park officials hunt down the 
estimated 4000 wild pigs ravaging this island off the southern 
california coast 
but park officials are telling the pig hunters not to get too 
fired up 
park officials have been deluged with offers of help since last

population so they can restore native wildlife and vegetation 
theyll say i want to get on the list said fred 
rodriguez a dispatcher for the park service theyll say how 
can i get to the island to kill pigs 
but park officials plan to hire professionals to do the work at 
a cost of 200000 to 800000 
most of the island has been ravaged by pigs digging roots 
eating acorns and plundering bird nests since european settlers 
abandoned the animals there in 1850 authorities said 
park officials expect the eradication of the pigs on the 
53000acre island to take about 1 years 
rodriguez said he receives at least 12 calls each day from 
hunters offering to do the job for free 
among his favorite calls was from a group at a tavern 
you could hear the countrywestern music in the background 
he said it was kind of comical actually it was something they 
thought they could do in one day

divers searching for treasure from a 
spanish ship that went down in a hurricane in 1715 have found a 
perfectly preserved 1foothigh silver bell 
gold coins are gold coins said ship capt carl lazzeri 
captain of the rogue wave whose divers made the find artifacts 
are one of a kind to find something in that good of condition is 
really exciting

of the santo cristo de san roman one of an 11ship fleet that sank 
during a hurricane after leaving cuba for spain since the early

the rogue wave is one of about 20 boats subcontracting this 
summer with treasure hunter mel fisher to search for treasure from 
sebastian inlet to st lucie inlet on floridas eastcentral coast 
diver gary daemer spotted the bell in 8 feet of water in 
sebastian inlet on july 23 
originally i thought it was a newer bell something from the 
1800s when we got the encrustation off then we knew we had 
something great daemer said 
dated 1705 the bell bears the latin inscription soli deo 
gloria or glory to god alone it was found alongside a small 
wooden beam to which it had once been attached

the white house today condemned the massacre 
of more than 200 people by government forces in liberia as a 
senseless act of terror but it said the united states was not 
about to send in any troops 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said us 
embassy officials had confirmed that liberian troops slaughtered 
some 200 people who had sought refuge at a lutheran church compound 
in monrovia witnesses said most of them were women and children 
we abhor this senseless act of terror and call again on all 
sides to the conflict to refrain from inflicting violence on 
helpless and innocent men women and children hart said 
he said all parties should respect internationally sanctioned 
protections for victims of armed conflict to prevent murder and the 
carrying out of executions without due process 
we renew the appeal which we have made both publicly and 
privately throughout this tragic conflict for both sides to forego 
a military solution and to follow the path of negotiations hart 
said 
despite the bloodshed hart said the united states was not 
committing any troops to liberia at this point he said we 
dont believe that would be a prudent course of action 
rebel forces seeking to overthrow president samuel doe were 
waging street battles in monrovia with government forces and have 
advanced within a mile of does seaside mansion 
hart said the united states remains willing to escort doe out of 
the country but that he has not asked for help in leaving 
asked if the united states held doe accountable for the massacre 
committed by his troops hart said we dont know who directed 
the action certainly we abhor the action his forces are 
taking

the american civil liberties union today 
filed a lawsuit against two school districts that permit prayer at 
graduation exercises and other school functions 
the aclu making good on legal action it had threatened for 
several months named the alpine and granite districts and several 
administrators in the suit filed in us district court 
the action was certain to touch off a legal battle that some 
including gov norm bangerter have suggested should be fought with 
state funds to ensure prayers would have a place in public schools 
it is with reluctance that the aclu has sponsored the filing 
of these lawsuits given the shortage of funds available to the 
school districts for important programs and teachers salaries 
aclu executive director michele parishpixler said at a news 
conference 
all of our efforts to resolve these problems out of court have 
been rejected we feel we have no alternative 
the plaintiffs include students who have graduated or are 
currently students in the two districts and a counselor and teacher 
in the alpine district in utah county 
parishpixler said earlier today that prayer in utah schools 
forces minor children into religious practices 
she said that although taking such an issue to court is 
always a gamble she felt confident the aclus utah chapter 
would prevail 
the filings culminate a monthslong dispute over the practice of 
permitting prayer at graduation exercises and other school 
functions in utah where about 70 percent of its 17 million 
residents are members of the mormon church 
in the time since graduation exercises marked the school years 
end the dispute has come to involve the aclu school districts 
the republican governor and a top official of the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints 
the debate began in 1989 when a student at the jordan school 
district complained that a mormonoriented prayer at graduation 
violated the students civil rights 
the jordan district later banned graduation prayer but the 
issue remained active through the 1990 school year 
even so a majority of utahns appear to favor prayer at some 
school functions according to a recent poll for the deseret news 
and ksltv 
the survey found that 72 percent of those questioned said they 
favored prayer at commencement ceremonies while 69 percent said 
prayers should be permitted in schools nineteen percent said 
prayer at graduation should be banned and 26 percent oppose school 
prayer 
of those who identified themselves as mormons 83 percent would 
accept prayer in the schools while protestants and catholics were 
split on the issue by political party 76 percent of the 
republicans favored school prayer as opposed to 58 percent of the 
democrats 
bangerter has said he would ask the legislature to appropriate 
money to help the districts battle the lawsuit although house 
speaker nolan karras rroy has said he would want to study the 
matter before committing state money to a costly and potentially 
fruitless proposition 
in a sunday editorial the churchowned deseret news supported 
bangerters intention saying that otherwise the school districts 
would be forced to bear the burden of costly litigation 
the newspaper also drew a distinction between school prayer and 
those at graduation exercises where most graduates and visitors 
are legal adults and where even those of faiths different from that 
of the person praying would hardly suffer psychological damage 
the salt lake tribune however opposes both school prayer and 
spending state money to defend it and planned an editorial for 
tuesdays editions said editorial writer diane cole

east germany has reversed its position and 
agreed to pay israel compensation for taking in thousands of 
refugees from nazi germany after world war ii according to a 
letter obtained monday 
the change was reflected in a letter from east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere to world jewish congress president 
edgar bronfman which said that talks should be convened to discuss 
compensation for the burden caused to israel with the absorption 
and integration of refugees from germany 
previously east germany had agreed to pay reparations to jewish 
organizations but not to israel 
even with the change east germany cannot afford the large sum 
of money involved and negotiations about the amount probably will 
take place next year after the east is united with wealthy west 
germany officials said the united germany will assume the 
financial responsibilities of the east once unification is 
completed by the end of this year 
talks on the subject between israeli and east german officials 
broke down in copenhagen on july 5 on the issue of reparations to 
israel for absorption of the refugees according to the israel 
foreign ministry 
at israels request the world jewish congress then intervened 
with the office of de maiziere said wjc executive director elan 
steinberg 
the letter from de maiziere said steinberg emerges as the 
voice of germanys moral conscience 
he said israel and the wjc wanted an east german commitment of 
principle on the reparations although talks on the sum to be 
repaid probably would not take place until after the union of east 
and west germany 
israel has demanded an east german commitment to pay reparations 
based on a formula reached with west germany in 1952 known as the 
luxembourg agreement 
the agreement called for total reparations of 45 billion 
deutsche marks to be paid to israel and jewish organizations for 
the costs of resettling destitute survivors of the nazi holocaust 
in which 6 million jews were killed 
west germany agreed to pay 3 billion of the total and said east 
germany would pay the other 15 billion 
however east germany was under the control of the soviets 
following world war ii and refused to recognize responsibility for 
the holocaust 
soon after throwing off communist rule in march however east 
germany announced it would accept moral responsibility for the 
crimes of the nazis it also agreed to compensate jewish 
organizations 
talks on those reparations which began last month have stalled 
pending resolution of the question of whether there should be 
compensation to israel in addition to the jewish organizations 
jewish sources said 
the east germans have now decided to compensate israel only the 
amount to be paid has not yet been resolved

president elias hrawis government on 
monday clamped an economic and diplomatic blockade on rebel gen 
michel aoun in an attempt to oust him from the christian enclave 
north of beirut 
syria the main power broker in lebanon immediately expressed 
support for the move aoun has demanded the withdrawal of the 
40000 troops syria maintains in lebanon 
also monday rival shiite militiamen fought artillery duels in 
south lebanon leaving six dead and 24 wounded the red cross said 
it was preparing a mission to evacuate bodies from earlier clashes 
the fighting was between the iranianbacked fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god and the syrianallied amal militia in 
the apple province 
the casualties raised the toll to 186 people killed and 560 
wounded since july 16 when renewed fighting broke out in the 
threeyear intermittent war for dominance of the 12 millionstrong 
shiite sect the largest in lebanon 
by police count 1232 people have been killed and 4203 wounded 
in the inconclusive power struggle 
the government directive instructed military checkpoints at all 
gateways into aouncontrolled areas to prohibit the passage of fuel 
tankers and trucks carrying ammunition or spare parts to aouns 
19000 troops 
the directive also banned civilians entering aouncontrolled 
territory from carrying more than 150 and prohibited money 
transfers to banks operating in his area 
the foreign ministry in mostly moslem west beirut called in 
diplomatic representatives monday and notified them that it will 
not tolerate any contacts between foreign representatives and aoun 
a government statement said the blockade was an initial move 
to end aouns mutiny and that if it failed to accomplish its 
objective a food blockade would be imposed after two weeks 
aoun who controls roughly 20 percent of the christian enclave 
denounced hrawis blockade as an attempt to starve out the 
people 
analysts say the effectiveness of the blockade depends largely 
on how far syria is willing to go in supporting hrawis drive to 
reestablish the state authority that has been eroded by 15 years 
of civil war 
jibran kourieh a spokesman for syrian president hafaz assad 
said assad had pledged to lebanese christian leaders that syria 
would fully support efforts to extend the hrawi governments 
authority to all of lebanon 
the us ambassador to syria edward djerejian told a news 
conference that syria and the united states both supported the 
hrawi government 
syrian troops entered lebanon in 1976 under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to end the civil war they control 70 percent of the 
countrys territory and ring the 310squaremile christian enclave 
aoun 54 controls the enclaves metn province he contends that 
a military cabinet he headed since september 1988 is the only 
legitimate government in lebanon 
the rest of the enclave including all its sea outlets is 
controlled by christian warlord samir geagea and his lebanese 
forces militia which has declared allegiance to hrawi 
the enclave was partitioned after an inconclusive confrontation 
between aoun and geagea that erupted jan 30 killing at least 
1044 people and wounding 2793 
hrawi was elected president nov 24 with strong syrian backing 
to enforce a peace accord worked out by lebanons parliament the 
agreement would end christian dominance in lebanon and give 
moslems who make up 55 percent of lebanons 4 million population 
an equal share of power aoun has objected to the accord saying it 
does not include a timetable for a syrian troop withdrawal from 
lebanon 
hrawi aoun and geagea are maronite catholics the sect that has 
dominated the government since lebanon gained independence from 
france in 1943

personal spending rose 10 percent in june 
the strongest gain in five months the government said monday in a 
report suggesting that consumers are keeping the nations weak 
economy alive 
this seems to indicate the consumer is not dead said mark 
m zandi an economist with regional financial associates in west 
chester pa as long as the consumer hangs in there i believe we 
will avoid a recession 
the commerce department said consumer spending totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 364 trillion the biggest jump 
since a similar 10 percent gain last january 
this does not indicate were going into an economic 
recession agreed sung won sohn chief economist with the norwest 
corp in minneapolis he noted that consumer spending accounts for 
twothirds of the nations economic activity 
consumer spending had been a source of concern in recent months 
spending rose just 02 percent in february and april and 03 
percent in march spending was unchanged in may 
as measured in the gross national product the nations total 
output of goods and services secondquarter personal spending 
actually fell 03 percent 
but sohn said the june personal consumption figure which 
includes everything except interest payments on debt indicates 
thirdquarter spending will be a source of strength for the economy 
the commerce department also said personal incomes rose 04 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464 trillion 
after 03 percent gains in april and may 
but the higher spending level resulted in a drop in americans 
savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable income to 
49 percent it had been 54 percent in may and 51 percent in 
april 
a higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital 
since funds thus would be available domestically for business 
investment 
all of mondays figures reflected major changes in last years 
numbers as a result of the commerce departments annual revision 
announced last week the biggest change involved the departments 
579 billion overestimate in wages and salaries which resulted in 
lowering the 1989 savings rate from 54 percent to 46 percent 
americans income after taxes increased 05 percent up from a 
03 percent gain a month earlier wages and salaries rose 130 
billion in june after a 101 billion increase in may 
personal consumption rose 345 billion including a 96 
billion gain in spending on durable goods items expected to last 
more than three years this included a robust 61 billion rebound 
in automobile sales which had been sluggish for much of the year 
spending on nondurable goods rose 82 billion the first 
advance since february spending for services increased 167 
billion the largest jump since a 204 billion advance in march

the united states has no plans to send 
military forces to trinidad where prime minister arthur robinson 
and more than 30 others are being held hostage by moslem rebels 
the state department said today 
at the same time deputy spokesman richard boucher criticized 
libyas involvement with the rebels saying it has provided some 
training for the insurgents but he said there was no apparent 
direct link between libya and the hostagetaking which occurred 
last friday 
boucher refused comment on reports that us military assets 
were being deployed in the vicinity of trinidad but said there 
are no plans for us military intervention 
the uss roosevelt paid a scheduled visit to portofspain july 
2023 the navy said the carrier is now in port in norfolk the 
navy has 10 ships in the caribbean on what the navy calls routine 
exercises 
boucher said there have been no reports of injury to the 
estimated 6000 americans living in trinidad 
president bush was keeping up to date on developments after 
returning to washington late sunday after a weekend at his vacation 
home in kennebunkport maine 
we fully support the government of prime minister arthur 
robinson and hope for a peaceful solution to the situation there 
said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
us officials said any direct us role had been all but ruled 
out even sending us experts on hostage negotiations discussed 
informally on saturday between the united states and 
representatives of the trinidad government had been ruled out 
sources said 
the trinidadians would like to find a solution on their own 
without any outside assistance theyd just rather settle it 
themselves the official said 
the administration has hailed trinidads government as a model 
of democracy and the attempted coup was viewed with distress in 
washington 
abu bakr the leader of a moslem sect launched the coup attempt 
late friday by seizing the parliament building in portofspain and 
capturing robinson and about 40 other hostages 
angus khan the ambassador from trinidad and tobago to the 
united states said the negotiations between his government and the 
terrorists over the release of the hostages are very delicate 
he refused to say more

an elderly japanese fisherman featured in a 
documentary akin to ernest hemingways the old man and the sea 
has died in what may have been a last fight with a big marlin the 
filmmaker said monday 
the body of shigeru itokazu 81 was found sunday floating in 
the east china sea off a small island south of okinawa in the 
ryukyu islands itokazu was found near the skiff in which he fished 
alone police in okinawa said 
other fishermen in the area did not see what happened but a 
wound on itokazus thumb apparently came from a suddenly tautened 
fishing line and indicated he was pulled into the sea probably by 
a marlin said john junkerman an american documentary filmmaker 
the line goes out very fast and can whip around in the air 
it apparently pulled him into the sea junkerman said 
junkerman a milwaukee native who divides his time between homes 
in boston and japan spent most of two years filming itokazu and 
life on the remote island of yonaguni his film titled in japanese 
the old man and the sea was released last month in okinawa 
it is very ironic and very unfortunate that mr itokazu had 
his end this way and so soon after the film was finished 
junkerman said 
the filmmaker spoke from yonaguni island where he flew from 
tokyo to join mourners at itokazus funeral monday 
itokazu fished from his dugoutlike 22foot skiff junkerman 
said on shore it was clear he was an 80yearold man but when 
he was out at sea it seemed he was 20 years younger the sea 
really was his element he loved it 
junkerman who made the film for a japanese production company 
said he didnt start out with the idea of mimicking the hemingway 
story but last year there were no marlin to be caught and the 
filming developed into something like the novel about an old 
fisherman who hadnt caught a fish in 84 days 
hemingways old man fishing alone in the gulf of mexico hooks 
a swordfish longer than his skiff he manages to subdue the huge 
fish and tie it to his boat but sharks tear it to pieces before he 
can get it to land 
itokazu often said its not very difficult to catch a marlin 
but the thing one has to do is take your time and catch the fish 
carefully junkerman recalled 
he very much respected the strength and danger of the 
marlin he said 
marlin fishing was good this year and itokazu was out looking 
for the large slender billfish when he died junkerman said

five colleges are hatching plans to help revamp 
neighboring public schools this fall and each say they are 
drawing lessons from boston universitys unprecedented management 
takeover of a nearby district 
no one is rushing to imitate boston universitys yearold 
ambitious effort to manage and radically transform the entire 
school district of chelsea mass a nearly broke system of 3500 
students with some of the worst test scores in that state 
but the universitys 10year plan to manage chelseas daytoday 
operations and raise tens of millions of dollars to finance reforms 
is apparently earning national credence as colleges seek ways to 
nurture school reform 
i think the very positive impact of the bostonchelsea 
relationship has been to encourage colleges to become more involved 
than they have been but i dont think the model of taking a system 
over will be the way it goes said robert atwell president of 
the american council on education in washington 
the focus is not so much on the model as on the results 
said peter greer dean of bus school of education 
the point of bus effort is to show that if you want to change 
education you have to take a comprehensive approach he said 
the buchelsea plan entering its second year this fall aims to 
rebuild dilapidated schools raise teacher salaries introduce 
literacy and prenatal care programs and boost standardized test 
scores 
so far however bu has fallen short of fundraising goals and 
is battling the local teacher union and some in chelsea still see 
the university as an invader imposing change 
despite those struggles officials of at least five colleges 
interested in helping nearby schools have recently contacted or 
visited bu to learn what works and what doesnt college and public 
school district officials said in interviews 
george mason university in fairfax va is in early talks 
that could lead to a contract to help transform the nearby manassas 
park school district manassas park superintendent james moyers 
said monday that the rural financially pressed district hopes to 
enter a comprehensive partnership with george mason ibm the city 
of manassas park and the signal hill development corp to stock 
classrooms with computers to revolutionize the way children learn 
and teachers teach 
officials of glassboro state college in glassboro nj 
general electric and the camden public schools are visiting boston 
this week to find out what works and what doesnt in the 
chelsea program said phil tumminia a vice president of glassboro 
state 
glassboro state received an 18500 ge grant this month to draft 
plans to improve camdens schools concentrating on better teacher 
training 
duke university in durham nc plans close ties with durham 
high school this fall and the buchelsea experiment was one of 
several models planners examined said duke spokeswoman janet san 
filippo 
under plans hatched last spring duke will start programs to get 
parents more involved in schools identify and teach gifted 
minority children who may not perform well on standardized tests 
and train college students as tutors 
mercyhurt college in erie pa will hold classes on campus 
for some 200 gifted erie pupils from kindergarten through eighth 
grade starting this fall said president william garvey 
depauw university in rural greencastle ind may send 
student teachers to chelsea to expose them to inner city 
multicultural classes said president robert bottoms 
in each case officials said bus management scheme with chelsea 
was far too ambitious financially and otherwise for most colleges 
public school officials for their part stressed that they had 
no desire to be taken over by a college or repeat the oftenstormy 
relationship in chelsea 
we are not putting ourselves up as experts in secondary school 
education we want to listen to them said san filippo of duke 
we dont want to go into this with any sense that we have a 
plan were going to impose agreed tumminia of glassboro state 
moyers of manassas park said that at one point george mason 
officials wanted a say in naming certain school district 
administrators 
the school board was having none of that moyers said 
another lesson being drawn from the bu experience is the need to 
let public schools take the initiative all five colleges stressed 
that they wanted relationships based on cooperation and shared 
knowledge 
erie school officials are telling us what they want from us 
garvey said 
the problems bu experienced in its relationship with chelsea 
didnt bother us said erie schools superintendent joseph 
rodriguez no one will dictate to anyone

supreme court nominee david souter as new 
hampshires attorney general opposed an order that the state pay 
for medicaid abortions 
in its 1976 brief the state referred to abortion as the 
killing of unborn children 
the brief was filed during a federal court appeal of a case 
begun during the tenure of souters predecessor warren rudman and 
souter did not personally argue the case new hampshires attorney 
general is appointed by the governor and required by law to 
represent the governors views in court new hampshires governor 
at the time was archconservative meldrim thompson 
souters name was listed on the brief but it was signed by its 
author richard wiesbusch then an assistant attorney general 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said he did not 
know if bush had been told about the 1976 brief whats important 
is the president supports his nominee hart said there were no 
specific issues queried about nor was there a litmus test in the 
nomination of souter whats important is that he bush chose 
the man based upon his merits what he thought was important 
bush in an address to the youth leadership coalition said 
today i am very happy with the way the choice has been received 
across the country 
it is moving in the proper direction and i probably wont have 
too much more to say about it the president said 
although nothing in the brief sheds any light on souters 
personal views on abortion the case likely will provide senate 
judiciary committee members eager to learn those views a vehicle to 
raise the issue 
clearly the senate should ask judge souter to address himself 
to this document at his confirmation hearings said arthur j 
kropp president of the liberal activist group people for the 
american way which today distributed copies of papers filed in the 
1976 case 
new hampshire was appealing to the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals a lower court injunction that it pay for elective abortions 
sought by medicaid patients during the resolution of a larger case 
in which the state was seeking to prove it didnt have to pay 
new hampshires brief acknowledged the us supreme courts 1973 
roe v wade decision legalizing abortion but argued that nothing in 
that landmark ruling required the state to use tax dollars to pay 
for abortions sought by medicaid recipients for reasons other than 
to preserve a pregnant womans life 
many thousands of new hampshire residents find the use of tax 
revenues to finance the killing of unborn children morally 
repugnant the states brief said

four zambians imprisoned for life for 
plotting to overthrow the president in 1980 were freed monday on 
his orders 
their release marked the latest in a series of political reforms 
made by president kenneth kaunda in the past month since the 
countrys bloodiest antigovernment riots left at least 26 people 
dead 
released were former high court commissioner edward shamwana 
former general manager of the state industrial finance company 
goodwin yoram mumba zairean politician deogratis symba and driver 
chilambe chimbalile 
shamwana a former kaunda aide acknowledged that he had plotted 
the coup and said he had no regrets 
the reason is i believed there was no other way to change 
things shamwana 57 told a news conference the ruling party 
does not allow fresh ideas or initiatives he added 
i believe it is time for people with fresh ideas a new period 
of wonderful opportunity he said 
shamwana said in the early days of imprisonment he was tortured 
illfed and at one stage stripped naked in a cell ankledeep in 
human waste 
he originally was sentenced to death but kaunda commuted that 
to life imprisonment two years ago 
a fifth plotter businessman thomas mulewa mupunga died in 
prison in 1987 of what the government said was natural causes 
a home affairs ministry statement announcing the releases 
hailed the move as a momentous occasion in zambias history 
the release signifies a victory for the forces of love and 
forgiveness under the philosophy of humanism the statement said 
they were freed at a ceremony attended by officials of the 
ruling united national independence party and church leaders the 
statement said 
reporters were excluded 
since the antigovernment riots in june kaunda a 67yearold 
onetime schoolteacher has announced a referendum next year for 
zambians to decide whether they want a return to a multiparty state 
kaunda who led the british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence as zambia in 1964 outlawed political opposition 17 
years ago arguing that westernstyle democracy in africa whipped 
up tribal hostilities 
under further pressure for change kaunda also has announced he 
would free all political prisoners release more than 1000 people 
arrested during the riots lifted a dusktodawn curfew and has not 
made any move against a prodemocracy movement forming with former 
politicians and civil servants wealthy businessmen and trade union 
leaders

carnegie mellon university hopes to 
legitimize the bagpipe by offering a major in the shrilltoned 
reed instrument 
the program with two students will begin in the universitys 
music department this fall 
sophomore vince mulhern who used to major in mechanical 
engineering recently applied for one of the two slots 
when my friends hear about this they laugh but no one has 
said to me im crazy he said of course i dont know what they 
say behind my back 
i was getting tired of engineering and this is intriguing 
said mulhern a bagpiper for two years 
the new program would be music to the ears of andrew carnegie 
the scottish immigrant who became a steel baron and founded the 
school the bagpipe is played mainly in scotland 
we think well be able to legitimize the instrument which 
when you think about it has been around a lot longer than some we 
use in orchestras said marilyn taft thomas head of the music 
department 
james mcintosh who has taught the instrument informally at the 
university for six years will head the new program 
mcintosh said student bagpipers will devote little time to the 
folksy tunes most often heard in parades 
they would concentrate on classical music and like all other 
music performance majors play the piano 
apart from anything else they will leave here qualified to be 
music teachers and i think will find there are good opportunities 
to teach the bagpipe in high schools mcintosh said i know 
there are schools who would like to have that but cant find anyone 
qualified to teach it

the soviet union and albania today agreed to 
normalize relations that were broken off 29 years ago during 
moscows split with china the tass news agency reported 
the agreement to reestablish ties and reopen embassies in 
moscow and tirana was reached during talks that were held in 
bulgaria in june and in tirana today tass said 
the soviet delegation was led by deputy foreign minister yuli 
kvitsinsky tass reported 
both sides were guided by a mutual desire to develop the 
relations of friendship and cooperation on the basis of 
sovereignty equality and noninterference in each others internal 
affairs the tass dispatch said 
moscow and tirana pledged to expand contacts in the political 
economic scientific technical and cultural areas it added 
last week soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov had said moscow was seeking to restore diplomatic 
relations with albania europes last bastion of stalinism 
albania broke off diplomatic relations with the soviet union in 
1961 as a result of the kremlins split with china which then 
became albanias chief communist ally 
albania left the warsaw pact in 1968 after the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
the balkan nation then broke with china in 1978 and established 
a course fiercely independent of both military blocs it prided 
itself on being selfreliant and claimed to be the only country 
practicing true communism 
albania also has no relations with the united states 
it has vowed to resist the democratic reforms sweeping eastern 
europe and still reveres the late soviet leader josef stalin even 
more important is communist albanias founding father enver hoxha 
who died in 1985 
but in recent weeks albanian citizens demanding change forced 
their way into foreign embassies in tirana and were allowed to 
leave the country

newmarketonfergus ireland ap the european communitys 
agriculture commissioner on monday proposed a 30 percent cut in 
farm subsidies over a 10year period in an effort to end a dispute 
that threatens global trade talks 
ray macsharry made the surprise proposal at a private meeting 
with the agriculture ministers of the united states japan canada 
and australia 
this is the first time the community has put a specific figure 
on the table said european commission spokesman john cooney 
the us delegation reacted coolly it said it would be 
inappropriate to negotiate a proposal outside ongoing talks 
involving the nations of gatt or the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade 
this is not a place to cut deals said kelly shipp a 
spokeswoman for us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who 
attended the meeting with macsharry the delegations from japan 
canada and australia agreed with the united states she said all 
are members of gatt 
the united states and 14 other farm exporting countries want the 
12nation european community to end its export credits system and 
cut direct subsidies for farmers 
the dispute is threatening the successful conclusion of the gatt 
talks on global trade liberalization however the us and ec 
teams expressed confidence an overall gatt agreement would be 
reached in december 
the socalled quint meeting of the worlds most powerful 
agriculture ministers was called by macsharry and held at dromoland 
castle about five miles outside shannon in western ireland 
several hundred irish farmers who depend heavily on ec aid 
demonstrated outside the meeting no gatt sellout was their 
slogan 
the other agriculture ministers gathered in ireland were japans 
tomio yamamoto australias john kerins and canadas donald 
mazankowski 
the five senior agriculture officials were assessing 
developments since the group of seven summit in houston in 
midjuly when the industrial worlds leaders spurred efforts to 
cut farm supports 
macsharry proposed cutting all european farm support by 30 
percent between 1986 and 1996 
the offer includes cuts that already have been implemented 
cooney said he cited reductions of 10 percent in support for crops 
and a 15 percent cut in livestock support 
it certainly is a substantive one proposal it cant be 
considered flippant cooney said 
the proposal will be presented to the european commission in 
september the commission would have to approve it before it could 
be considered at gatt he said 
gatt negotiators are to meet again in geneva in late august 
they agreed at a meeting last week to compile lists and costs of 
their farm support by oct 1 
the developed worlds farm subsidies cost consumers and 
taxpayers 245 billion last year according to the parisbased 
organization for economic cooperation and development

its hardly surprising but a survey has found 
that people will go to great lengths to avoid taxes even crossing 
state lines to pay lower sales and excise taxes 
the american legislative exchange council a national bipartisan 
organization of state lawmakers commissioned price waterhouse to 
do the survey to find out how much states ultimately pay by 
charging higher taxes 
the survey looked at two pairs of states with pronounced 
differences in their taxes massachusetts and new hampshire and 
indiana and illinois 
it concluded that new hampshire enjoys most of the economic 
benefits in the phenomenon it calls crossborder activity 
for the two midwestern states there was more give and take 
though overall indiana came out ahead indiana benefits at 
illinois expense from favorable crossstate line trade in tobacco 
and gasoline illinois benefits in the sale of wine and liquor 
the survey was released friday at the groups annual meeting 
here where 1500 participants gathered from thursday until sunday 
the findings are no surprise but they suggest that lawmakers 
need to change their perspective when they set out to raise taxes 
said economist paul lawrence author of the survey report 
under certain circumstances the borders of the states in 
terms of the taxpayers are not geographic borders lawrence said 
in a telephone call from an office in springfield va 
politicians tend not to think about neighboring states but 
when people in massachusetts raise their taxes to raise revenue 
people in new hampshire end up raising money 
the commodities surveyed were gasoline wine and liquor and 
tobacco the years examined were 1975 to 1988 
massachusetts has a sales tax of 5 percent new hampshire has 
none in 1988 new hampshires excise tax on a cigarette carton was 
170 in massachusetts it was 260 new hampshire owns all liquor 
wholesale and retail businesses keeping the revenue and selling 
the alcohol at lower prices than those found in massachusetts 
based on these figures and others the survey reckoned 
the average annual economic benefits for new hampshire came to 
224 million from added tax revenue 1042 million in added 
retail sales and 796 jobs earning 86 million 
the cost to massachusetts was an annual loss of 13 percent of 
cigarette sales and 72 percent of annual wine and liquor sales 
because massachusetts residents bought those goods in new hampshire 
in illinois fuel taxes came to 21 cents a gallon compared with 
18 cents a gallon in indiana the tax on wine in illinois was an 
estimated 113 a gallon compared to 147 a gallon in indiana 
liquor taxes in illinois were 380 a gallon against 468 in 
indiana a carton of cigarettes in illinois came with a tax of 
272 indiana taxes on a carton were 210 
overall the boon to indiana totaled 588 million in sales and 
excise taxes 3116 million in retail sales and 1996 jobs paying 
225 million 
the losses to illinois came to 697 million in potential sales 
and excise taxes 3768 million in potential retail sales and the 
loss of 2949 jobs earning 31 million

inside trader ivan boesky and watergate 
figure hr haldeman once called it home now their country 
club prison is being fortified as a higher security lockup for 
hardtime inmates 
lompoc federal prison camp which was free of walls fences 
bars guns and watch towers will be ready to receive inmates as a 
medium security prison by early august said prison spokesman gavin 
oconnor its been one of 26 minimumsecurity federal prisons 
its quicker and cheaper to convert the camp to a prison than 
to build an entirely new facility he said 
most of lompocs lowrisk inmates will be transferred to other 
lowsecurity camps on the west coast in the next few weeks 
oconnor said 
prison camps such as lompoc are referred to as country club 
prisons or club fed because of the privileges inmates receive 
prisoners can wander about freely jog play tennis or lawn bowl 
guards are unarmed 
escapes have been rare at lompoc because those caught are sent 
to a traditional prison oconnor said

chung who will continue anchoring the sunday editions of the 
cbs evening news reportedly is paid 13 million annually she

welcome face to face back to the schedule as a weekly series 
chung who joined cbs news in 1971 and left for nbc in 1983

saturday night with connie chung

face specials 
cbs has been third in ratings for three seasons and hoped 
chungs new series would help its bid for a comeback next fall but 
george schweitzer senior vice president for communications at the 
broadcast group insisted that her withdrawal wont hurt the 
networks monday night plans 
not at all he said cbs replacement series has a popular 
wellknown star and is made by the same team that made cagney amp 
lacey a monday night staple on cbs he said 
chungs husband who has anchored the syndicated a current 
affair ever since fox broadcasting began it in 1986 has signed 
with the rival paramount domestic television to coproduce and 
anchor a new talk show that starts in the fall of 1991

personal trips with virginia gov l douglas wilder did not speak 
during a 15minute hearing in albemarle county general district

portofspain trinidad ap gunfire and explosions broke out 
today around the government television station and parliament 
where moslem extremists held the prime minister and 30 other people 
hostage for a fourth day 
later today an anglican minister negotiating between the 
government and the rebels said a settlement was likely 
the heaviest shooting was centered on the television station 
whose employees were taken hostage friday automatic rifle and 
machinegun fire was punctuated by what sounded like artillery 
booms 
one witness said he heard four explosions that sounded like 
bombs 
a major firefight is going on said a diplomatic source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the shooting at the station appeared to be coming from two 
directions but it was not clear whether security forces had tried 
to storm the building 
earlier automatic weapons fire rang out near parliament about 
a mile from the television station where rebels seized prime 
minister arthur nr robinson on friday witnesses said they heard 
what sounded like heavy artillery booms 
a ham radio operator in trinidad said he monitored a radio 
communication indicating security forces had stormed the television 
station and were moving on parliament 
but col ralph brown of the trinidadtobago defense force denied 
the station was attacked 
he told reporters that troops had fired on the tv station when 
the rebels tried to leave the building some of his men tried to 
come out and we are not letting them out 
an anglican minister who was negotiating between the rebels and 
the government the rev knolly clarke also spoke with reporters 
early this afternoon 
when asked if a peaceful solution was likely he said yes 
today the end is in sight 
one of the rebels inside parliament kwasi attiba said by 
telephone that a tentative agreement with the government had been 
reached to end the siege 
attiba said the accord called for robinson to resign immediately 
and be replaced by deputy prime minister winston dookeran attiba 
gave no indication when robinson and other other hostages would be 
released and no government official could be reached to confirm 
his report 
an agreement was also reported sunday by a television executive 
jones madeira who was held at the station he said in a telephone 
interview that under the plan robinson would turn over power to an 
interim government which would rule until elections in three 
months 
robinson won the 1986 parliamentary elections by a landslide 
and the next elections are not scheduled until 1991 
the rebels claim robinsons government is corrupt and 
responsible for widespread poverty in this once oilrich country 
they claimed saturday to have wired robinson with explosives and 
threatened to blow him up if a rescue attempt was made 
attiba said the gunfire at parliament came from police who 
have been attempting to thwart negotiations 
attiba said the rebels were holding eight government ministers 
along with the prime minister 
energy minister herbert atwell said sunday the two sides were 
far from a settlement but attiba said we are very hopeful for 
an amicable solution 
security forces patrolled the capital with orders to shoot 
looters on sight 
abu bakr leader of a black moslem commune stormed parliament 
on friday and captured robinson and most of his cabinet bakr is 
believed backed by libya but has little general support 
simultaneously the rebels seized the government television 
station and its employees 
unconfirmed reports said more than 20 people had been killed in 
the fighting a medical officer at the state hospital said today he 
could confirm only five deaths including that of a police officer 
fires burned in the capital of portofspain on sunday there 
was scattered gunfire and widespread looting convoys of cars and 
pickup trucks were loading up with everything from looted powdered 
milk to refrigerators electric stoves and television sets 
the government sent police and military patrols to reestablish 
order and continued a nationwide curfew that was imposed saturday 
atwell representing the government appeared on national 
television late sunday with an official statement saying i am in 
no position to offer any hope that the situation will be resolved 
speedily andor amicably 
he confirmed reports that robinson and justice minister selwyn 
richardson had each been shot in the leg 
staterun radio 610 said nolli clarke an anglican priest was 
the official mediator with help from anglican bishop clive abdullah 
and roman catholic archbishop anthony patin 
the red cross sent mobile units to take blood donations from 
people too frightened to leave their homes 
radio 610 estimated damage downtown at 50 million as thousands 
of people looted stores shopping centers warehouses and 
industrial plants 
a spokeswoman for president bush said sunday that american 
citizens and tourists on trinidad and tobago did not appear to be 
in danger 
obviously we support the government and are coordinating 
closely with them until the situation is resolved a state 
department official said in washington the official did not want 
to be identified 
bakr is a former policeman in his mid40s who converted to islam 
in 1980 while living in canada 
he founded jamaat almuslimeen which means the moslem group in 
arabic in 1984 and set up a commune on land he said had been 
donated to moslems by the late prime minister eric williams 
bakr built a mosque a school and a kitchen to feed the 
homeless some 250 to 300 moslems live there 
bakr has visited libya several times and is believed to have 
received assistance from that country

president bush thanked the nations 
governors for a bipartisan constructive relationship on 
education monday even as democrats stepped up their protest 
against the administrations latest tax proposal 
bush addressed the governors at their national governors 
association annual summer conference speaking by remote telephone 
hookup from the white house 
he pledged continued support for the education reform goals he 
and the governors agreed on last year and endorsed their revised 
plans for a national oversight panel that will grade the states and 
federal government on progress in meeting the goals democrats had 
insisted on the changes to deny republicans control of the panel 
i think it is essential there be some definitive way of 
measuring progress toward these education goals during the 90s 
and this decision makes good sense bush said i want to 
thank everyone there for the constructive relationship that weve 
developed 
washington gov booth gardner a democrat and incoming chairman 
of the governors asked bush to obtain full federal funding for 
head start and early childhood development programs that are part 
of the education goals bush said well see what we can do 
democrats meanwhile were circulating a letter for signature by 
the governors that protests in strong terms the administrations 
proposal in budget negotiations to raise federal revenues by 
limiting the deduction for state income taxes a proposal 
governors say encroaches on state tax bases 
to eliminate this deduction would result in a double tax on 
our citizens said the letter 
it was being pushed by massachusetts gov michael dukakis whom 
bush defeated in the 1988 presidential election and maryland gov 
william donald schaefer 
the notion of putting the burden on the states again for 
washingtons inability to deal with its fiscal problems is just 
outrageous dukakis said in an interview 
governors in both parties have voiced opposition to the federal 
proposal arguing that limiting the deduction for state taxes to 
10000 would make it more difficult for states to raise their own 
taxes and put pressure on them to roll back income taxes they said 
it comes after states have spent a decade absorbing cuts in federal 
aid and after most states have had to raise their own taxes 
dukakis said bush who used his read my lips no new taxes 
slogan so effectively in the 1988 campaign has made the deficit 
worse by delaying action and now in breaking his pledge is 
hammering the states 
if mr bush no matter how devastating it might have been to 
his poll ratings had moved early as everybody knew had to be done 
i dont think wed be in the kind of mess were in now 
dukakis said 
the letter pushed by dukakis and schaefer went beyond a milder 
mention that republican gov terry branstad outgoing chairman of 
the governors organization and gardner made in a letter to bush 
before the meeting 
dukakis letter said the administrations plan amounts to a 
suggestion that our citizens should pay a federal penalty tax for 
living in a state that has taken responsibility for paying for 
its own services 
the deduction issue affects states unevenly falling heaviest on 
northeastern states with high income taxes and not affecting those 
that have no income tax 
the governors made only brief mention of their opposition when 
white house chief of staff john sununu former governor of new 
hampshire appeared before the governors sunday sununu said he 
couldnt talk about items that were a part of budget negotiations 
with congress 
but dukakis noted that the proposal wouldnt limit the deduction 
for local property taxes and that it just so happens new 
hampshire has the highest property taxes in the country new 
hampshire has no income tax

a proposal by democratic governors for a 
national commission to investigate the savings and loan crisis was 
rejected today by the white house 
we do feel it is unnecessary to create another bureacratic 
body white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said in 
washington 
we think the best thing to do is to work quickly on the 
current caseload with the funds and the processes we now have in 
place which are working hart said we feel its not time 
to point fingers but its time to get the money thats owed to the 
depositors back in their hands 
the commission idea was pushed by democrats at the national 
governors association annual summer conference 
they also forced republicans to accept changes in a proposed 
national education oversight panel made up of governors members of 
congress and white house appointees 
bipartisan is a very convenient word when you have a 
president of your party because what youre asking is to have 
everyone walk handinhand with the president said ohio gov 
richard celeste head of the democratic governors who is 
considered to have presidential ambitions 
however he added that isnt real bipartisan policymaking 
separately president bush addressed the meeting by telephone 
and said he wanted to continue a partnership with the governors to 
improve americas schools i recognize there is diversity and 
ive made it a point not to get involved in any state pointing out 
how a governor might attempt to do the job better bush said 
sundays opening session got off to a rocky start when democrats 
expressed their frustration over an element of the education 
reforms they agreed on with president bush last fall and winter 
fearing that a national panel to grade states on their progress 
in meeting education goals could become a partisan sword in the 
hands of the gopcontrolled white house democratic governors 
failed to show up for a task force meeting on education with their 
gop colleagues 
after a series of closeddoor meetings the governors agreed to 
a formula making any decisions impossible without a threequarters 
majority giving democrats on the panel an effective veto power 
they also agreed that the panel would give the federal 
government and the bush white house a score on how it lives up 
to goals for improving federal education research and supporting 
early childhood development 
republican gov carroll campbell of south carolina fumed that 
democrats were trying to polarize the governors and disrupt a 
years consensus on education reforms thirtysix governors seats 
are at stake in this falls elections 
if partisanship is more important than education then ill 
let them defend that campbell said 
white house chief of staff john sununu a former chairman of the 
governors as new hampshires chief executive appeared before his 
former colleagues to defend the administrations latest proposal to 
raise revenue by limiting the deductibility of state and local 
taxes governors in both parties oppose the idea as an encroachment 
on state tax authority 
celeste reminded sununu that when he headed the governors 
association one of the concerns you raised at that time was how 
to protect the revenue base of state and local government 
but sununu responded that the original bush budget was 
consistent with the concerns you raised he warned that without 
a deficitreduction agreement domestic programs face 40 percent 
cuts under the automatic budgetbalancing law 
the proposal on sampls amounts to a statement of concern and a 
request to congress and the president it passed on a voice vote of 
the nga executive committee and is subject to a vote of all the 
governors on tuesday the meetings last day 
michigan gov james blanchard a democrat predicted congress 
and president bush would ignore it but he said the statement 
amounted to a vote of noconfidence in federal action on sampls 
so far 
virginia gov douglas wilder a democrat who proposed the 
commission idea said its job would be to determine what went 
wrong he insisted he was not interested in bashing the 
administration 
the only people who are going to pay are the taxpayers 
wilder said the taxpayers are entitled to know 
republican governors unsuccessfully tried to delete mention of 
the commission gov garrey carruthers of new mexico called it a 
feelgood vote and gov john ashcroft of missouri said it would 
only delay a solution 
i think the time for studying is over ashcroft said

below state media said monday 
the state news agency rompres said 10 of the injured were in

illegally and resell them at much higher prices on the black market 
romania for years has been plagued by widespread consumer and 
food shortages

a series of irish republican army bombings has 
highlighted the groups ability to get around security in england 
where fear of terrorism is balanced against a determination to live 
normally 
police believe the bomb that killed conservative party lawmaker 
ian gow monday was planted by the ira which has recently struck 
against the british army the stock exchange and a london club 
favored by conservatives 
no group however immediately claimed responsibility for the 
slaying of gow outside his home in southeastern hankham 
metal detectors at the house of commons and a barrier guarding 
the prime ministers home testify to the threat but most of london 
remains a relaxed and open city 
politicians and experts on terrorism argue that intensive 
security and fear would indicate a victory for the ira which has 
waged a terrorist campaign against british rule in northern ireland 
for two decades 
gow killed by a bomb stuck beneath his car had been warned he 
was on an ira hit list but his telephone number was listed and 
neighbors said his gate was often open 
mr gow was determined not to live in a castle and be 
protected said jonathan graves parish priest in gows village 
he lived an open life 
peter bottomley another conservative lawmaker expressed the 
feeling of many politicians on increased security 
we need to take obvious and sensible precautions but the 
idea that each of us can have four bodyguards around us would mean 
that the ira had won 
the recent attacks however have prompted appeals for a return 
of the tight security following the death of six people in an ira 
bombing at harrods department store in 1983 for a time bags and 
parcels were searched at shop entrances 
scotland yard recently distributed 13000 posters advertising a 
tollfree hotline for reporting suspicious activities a 
spokeswoman for scotland yard said a surge in notifications of 
suspicious parcels indicated heightened public concern 
late last year a gate and a retractable concrete barrier were 
installed at prime minister margaret thatchers official residence 
no 10 downing street 
but terrorism expert ian geldard said increasing security for 
all politicians who now rely on mundane precautions such as 
checking beneath cars would not necessarily be the best solution 
you can never have total security geldard said the 
terrorists always have the advantage because they can choose the 
time and the place 
geldard editor of terror update a privately circulated 
newsletter said the ira clearly has targeted specific 
establishments and individuals 
it would not be particularly sensible to increase security for 
everyone the amount of disruption would be a victory for the 
ira he said 
an unidentified ira leader discussed the groups strategy in an 
interview published in the june 28 edition of republican news the 
weekly newspaper of the ira and its sinn fein political wing 
the ira intends to surprise the enemy give them no rest 
continually pressurize them and of course to hit them where it 
hurts preferably at the central nervous system the leader said 
he gave as an example the attack on the carlton club a facility 
frequented primarily by members of the conservative party 
there was no warning before that bombing or before gow was 
killed but eight warnings preceded the explosion in the visitors 
gallery at the stock exchange on july 20 
mrs thatcher on monday urged lawmakers to take warnings 
seriously 
many members of parliament indeed all of them will have been 
given advice to have special regard for safety she said i 
make one plea that they take that advice very seriously indeed 
for themselves and their families and their staffs 
government security advisers refuse to detail arrangements but 
it is widely believed lawmakers are advised to vary their daily 
routine mrs thatcher monday told lawmakers to check under their 
cars and examine all parcels arriving by mail

government troops today broke into a 
refugee camp in monrovia and massacred at least 600 people most of 
them women and children witnesses said 
the government denied responsibility 
people who said they escaped the attack said about 30 soldiers 
blasted the church door down with machines guns they then opened 
fire on an estimated 2000 people from the gio and mano tribes who 
had taken refuge there the gio and mano tribes speak a different 
language than the government troops 
one witness who visited the lutheran church compound in the 
sinkor district of the capital said he saw women with their heads 
smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets babies still tied to 
their backs 
bodies of other people were hanging from the window frames of 
the church building apparently killed while trying to escape he 
said 
i saw dead bodies all around the source said this is 
genocide he spoke on condition of anonymity 
earlier today in washington white house deputy press secretary 
stephen hart said us embassy officials confirmed that liberian 
troops slaughtered at least 200 people at the church compound 
there was no independent confirmation of the 600 dead figure 
a spokesman for president samuel doe said rebels were 
responsible for the killings in a radio telephone call to the 
british broadcasting corp in london the spokesman said rebels 
wearing government uniforms killed the civilians 
refugees at a methodist church across the street fled when they 
heard the killing 
thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war between rebel forces 
and the crumbling government of president samuel doe are crowded 
into refugee camps in the area their numbers have swelled recently 
as rebel troops have stormed into monrovia 
the witnesses said soldiers broke into the church compound at 
about 2 am when the refugees were asleep there was no telephone 
in the compound so the victims had no way of calling for help 
most refugees were members of the gio and mano tribes which 
form the main support for the rebels most of does troops are from 
his krahn tribe and the mandingo tribe 
refugees sought protection at the church at the end of may after 
government soldiers attacked them at un headquarters in monrovia 
the soldiers killed an unarmed security guard and abducted about 30 
civilian men many of their bodies were later discovered on the 
outskirts of the capital 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar withdrew all un 
staff from liberia in protest halting an emergency program to aid 
war refugees the un chief said in new york that he reacted

defense secretary dick cheney ordered monday 
that the number of generals and admirals assigned to his staff be 
cut in half 
cheney directed that 13 of the 27 spots on his personal staff 
that are saved for army air force marine generals and navy 
admirals be eliminated filled with civilians or given to lower 
ranking military officers a pentagon statement said 
the effect isnt necessarily immediate since the changes will 
be made when the officers in the present positions finish their 
tours of duty or move on to their next assignments the statement 
said 
the change is in line with the defense departments moves to 
pare the nations armed forces in response to world changes and 
tighter budgets the statement said 
the affected job positions include the adviser for nato affairs 
the deputy assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs 
the assistant inspector general and the assistant to the assistant 
to the secretary of defense for atomic energy 
it follows an order cheney made last month to eliminate 78 of 
the pentagons 1073 flag officer positions over the next four 
years mondays action doesnt add to that number it only 
designates that 13 of those general officer slots no longer be on 
cheneys personal staff the statement said 
the managers of the staff organizations affected by cheneys 
decision can decide what will be done with each slot the statement 
said 
with fewer generals and admirals those who remain must be 
placed in positions of command and crucial military 
responsibility the statement quoted cheney as saying we 
cannot afford to assign our most seasoned and experienced military 
officers to pentagon staff jobs that could be handled by civilians 
or less senior military officers 
pentagon spokesman bill turner said he knew of no study that had 
been undertaken to determine the cost savings behind such a move 
turner predicted however that the longterm savings could be 
substantial due to reduced salaries and the cost of the support 
facilities generally offered highranking military men and women 
the lowestranking general a onestar now earns a little over 
69000 a year not including allowances for such things as housing 
and food a fourstar receives a maximum of 83000 a year in base 
pay turner said

new musicals an ambitious laboratory for the 
development of new american musical theater has folded after only 
one production it was announced monday 
the production company was terminated july 25 one month after 
its first show kiss of the spider woman closed out a 
disappointing run at the state university of new york at purchase 
i overestimated the boxoffice income and undercapitalized the 
operation said martin j bell producing director of new 
musicals the size of our audience could only support workshops 
or small musicals which was contrary to our mission 
spider woman was a lavish musical version of the manuel puig 
novel it had a book by terrence mcnally a score by john kander 
and fred ebb and was directed by harold prince the musical which 
starred john rubinstein and kevin gray played an eightweek 
engagement in purchase from may 1 through june 24 
new musicals had a 10 million budget for its first year which 
was to have included three more musicals investors including 
capital citiesabc inc columbia artists management inc and 
jujamcyn theaters had put up a total of about 25 million to get 
the project going 
other moneys were expected from the boxoffice receipts of 
spider woman which drew less than 40 percent capacity at a 
1375seat theater in the universitys performing arts complex 
bell said the boxoffice receipts were hurt by the mostly 
negative reviews especially in the new york times the producer 
had asked that critics not review the show because it was a work in 
progress and that a review defeats what were trying to do 
here besides the times the musical was reviewed by the daily 
news the new york post the associated press and several other 
publications 
my heart is broken but working on kiss of the spider woman 
with hal prince john kander fred ebb terrence mcnally and the 
rest of the gang was worth it all bell said there were times 
sitting in that theater during the process when i knew this was the 
only place on earth i wanted to be

more than 100 members of parliament have 
signed a petition urging president wojciech jaruzelski to resign 
newspapers reported monday 
the signatures were gathered late friday by members of the 
center alliance a 2monthold political organization that backs 
the election of solidarity chairman lech walesa to replace 
jaruzelski this fall said the governmentowned daily 
rzeczpospolita 
jaruzelski the former communist party leader has already 
indicated he will resign before his term officially expires in july 
1995 
jaruzelski told the sejm the 460member lower house of 
parliament on saturday that he endorses plans to hold a debate in 
september on the proper timing of new presidential and 
parliamentary elections 
the center alliance petition asks jaruzelski to step down in 
recognition that conditions have changed since his election in july 
1989 
appreciating your contributions mr president since taking 
office we appeal to you now to show understanding for the historic 
challenges of the new era and to resign from office the petition 
said 
jaruzelski was elected president by parliament with the help of 
some members of solidarity a year ago after polands communist 
party became the first in the east bloc to give up its monopoly on 
power and hold partially free elections 
at the time it was thought jaruzelskis holding the presidency 
would insure smooth relations with the soviet union and polands 
thenhardline communist neighbors east germany and czechoslovakia 
since then orthodox communist leaders have been ousted in a 
democratic upheavals that led to multiparty elections throughout 
eastern europe 
many poles consider jaruzelskis remaining as president to be 
out of step with the changes elsewhere in the region jaruzelski 
led the december 1981 martial law crackdown that suppressed the 
solidarity labor movement but later initiated negotiations on 
powersharing that resulted in the union becoming legal again last 
year 
walesa has not declared his intention to run for president but 
his supporters are gathering allies in the sejm and the 100member 
senate for a possible vote to elect him to the post in coming 
months 
opposing walesa are members of a new progovernment party the 
citizens movement for democratic action which favors a 
constitutional amendment that would require a direct popular vote 
for president they believe walesa could be defeated in such a 
ballot 
some members of democratic action are promoting solidarity prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki as a more viable presidential candidate 
than walesa 
both democratic action and center alliance have grown out of the 
solidarity movement now deeply split into prowalesa and 
promazowiecki wings

patients of a florida dentist who may 
have given a woman aids could be tracked down and asked to take 
aids tests but they couldnt be told why officials said monday 
florida law protects the identity of anyone who has aids even 
from those who may have been infected by the person 
the us centers for disease control last week described a case 
involving a 21yearold college student who may have gotten aids 
from her dentist during a tooth extraction the dentist was 
diagnosed with aids three months earlier and wore gloves and a mask 
state health officials have made no public comment about 
published reports that the woman was from somewhere in florida 
two sources however confirmed monday on condition they not be 
identified that it was a florida dentist 
the cdc said the case was the first in the nation involving a 
health professional possibly transmitting aids although 
researchers could not positively say how the woman got infected 
but the cdc did rule out more conventional ways of getting the 
disease such as sexual encounters or intravenous drug use 
the name of any florida resident who has acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or who tests positive for the aids virus is 
confidential under florida law said spokesman steve konicki of the 
department of health and rehabilitative services 
while officials wouldnt confirm publicly that the cdc case 
originated in florida they were willing to say that if it did the 
state has the ability to track down the dentists patients to urge 
them to be tested for aids 
if this was a florida case hrs would be able to contact 
patients of the doctor said brian ballard gov bob martinezs 
chief of staff i can assure you that hrs understands their 
mission is public safety 
the patients would not be told however that their connection 
to the dentist was the reason they were asked to take an aids test 
konicki said 
that same confidentiality protection applies to anyone with aids 
to encourage them to disclose names of people to whom they may have 
transmitted the disease 
the intent of the law the confidentiality part of the law is 
that it only goes to the identity of somebody whos infected 
said state rep lois frankel chairwoman of the task force that 
produced a sweeping 1988 florida aids law 
confidentiality is an important part of contact tracing she 
said you cant force someone to give you the name of a partner 
questions were raised about the laws that protect patient 
records of doctors and dentists which would be one of the only 
ways to obtain names of those at risk while ballard said the state 
should have access to the overriding issue of public health others 
arent so sure 
its confidential the only thing the state could do is go 
to court and get a court order theyd have to rule that the case 
overrides the patientdoctor relationship said state rep elaine 
gordon chairwoman of the house health care committee 
announcement of the case and the national attention it triggered 
drew complaints from the american dental association which worried 
that it would make the public fear a dentists office as a place of 
danger and infection 
florida health officials questioned whether the cdc knew enough 
to go public with such a potentially frightening report 
dr harold jaffe deputy director for science at the cdcs 
hivaids program responded that it was in the publics interest to 
publicize the case

a mild rainy summer has been ideal for marijuana 
cultivation in the midwest police say as they work to weed out an 
expected bumper crop 
it isnt just the weather thats boosting production steppedup 
federal efforts to stop drugs from being smuggled into the country 
have driven up the price of marijuana encouraging the growers to 
increase their efforts according to federal authorities and law 
enforcement officials in several states 
weve had all this rain good hot humid weather which 
marijuana thrives in and plenty of people interested in making a 
little money said sgt jim hinkle of the illinois state police 
hinkle coordinates operation cash crop an eradication program 
the state runs jointly with the us drug enforcement 
administration 
illinois indiana kansas minnesota missouri oklahoma texas 
and wisconsin are expected to have massive tracts of cultivated and 
wild marijuana by fall officials said california though wracked 
by drought also is likely to produce a bumper crop of marijuana 
officials said 
the us drug enforcement administration says usgrown 
marijuana is netting drug dealers hundreds of millions of dollars 
annually cultivated high quality marijuana like the potent 
sinsemilla variety sells for about 2500 a pound hinkle said 
one plant can provide a pound of the drug he said 
the street price of averagegrade marijuana is about 160 to 
240 per ounce this year across the country up from 120 to 180 
an ounce a year ago according to the dea 
authorities hope to get the jump on pot growers before the 
harvest season which lasts for three months beginning in september 
in northern california over the weekend about 200 federal and 
state agents descended on prime public land to hunt for pot in what 
was called the largest marijuana raid in the state 
an even bigger problem officials say is finding ditch 
weed the wild plant has little potency but is used to cheat 
buyers by mixing with higherquality strains 
ditch weed grows in abundance in many states much to the 
consternation of police because it is an offspring of seeds 
planted when marijuana was cultivated to make hemp rope in world 
war ii drug officials say 
it is after all a weed and it grows and grows and 
grows hinkle said 
nebraska in 1989 eradicated more than 73 million ditch weed 
plants and 6300 cultivated marijuana plants thats nearly twice 
the number of ditch weed plants plucked in indiana which ranks 
second to nebraska in wild weed destruction according to dea 
statistics 
jeff hanson spokesman for the nebraska state patrol said the 
state has been a magnet for people looking for free marijuana 
i think word kind of spread around that we have marijuana 
here hanson said in a telephone interview we get a lot of 
outofstate plates on these rural dirt roads and you dont have 
to be superintelligent to figure out these people arent out there 
just to enjoy the scenery 
police everywhere say pot farmers are hard to catch because the 
land where marijuana thrives often is isolated 
many states rely on informants and aerial surveillance to nab 
suspects and spot marijuana plots illinois offers 1000 to 
residents who call in with information leading to a substantive 
arrest 
critics say the use of informants smacks of spying on the 
neighbors but law enforcement officials contend the publics help 
in eradicating illegal drugs is vital 
its difficult to catch these guys and to prove a case 
especially a cultivation case hanson said we really do need 
the publics help

two journalists alleged monday that some radio 
reporters working freelance for foreign stations accepted money or 
favors from the foreign ministry to do proisrael stories packaged 
as independent news items 
the two speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
freelancers worked out of a jerusalem recording studio that has 
close ties with the ministry 
the ministry denied the allegations in a statement released 
monday but said it suspended all ties with the studio lest some 
aspects of the current arrangements be misconstrued as 
involving a conflict of interest 
the new york times reported monday that ministry officials 
secretly channeled money to the studio to pay the reporters 
salaries it also said israeli diplomats abroad helped the 
freelance reporters recruit radio clients in major locations 
one jerusalembased radio reporter told the associated press the 
ministry paid the studio fee of 75 per hour for some freelance 
reporters who otherwise would have to cover the expense themselves 
in return sometimes they ministry officials ask the 
reporters to publish certain information the reporter said 
another broadcast journalist said some colleagues working for 
foreign stations accepted money from the ministry in exchange for 
stories favorable to israel packaged as independent news reports 
the ministry statement monday declared there are no 
journalists on the foreign ministry payroll 
the ministry said it has worked with the studio for years 
commissioning programs on current events and other subjects that 
are distributed by israeli embassies abroad 
it said the programs were distributed by us and in our name 
the ministry claimed that it decided to suspend ties with the 
studio on july 18 10 days before it was first asked by the new 
york times about the relationship 
a foreign ministry spokesman said the ministry was concerned 
that some journalists who worked for the studio were also 
independent journalists meaning they freelanced for clients 
abroad 
but avi yaffe owner of the studio said the suspension was a 
result of the media inquiries 
about 2 weeks ago they ministry officials said there are 
all kinds of journalists that are asking questions we think we 
have a problem here yaffe told the ap in an interview at his 
studioon herzl boulevard in jerusalem 
they ministry officials said they dont want problems they 
dont want to be linked to something like this 
yaffe said nearly half his business came from the foreign 
ministry but denied allegations of a covert link 
he said freelance reporters use his studio to produce programs 
for foreign radio stations including two major us networks and 
outlets in europe south america africa and asia 
yaffe said he had more than 10 freelance reporters working in 
the studio most of the reporters are also working for other 
media organizations and they are moonlighting here he said 
he refused to identify the reporters 
yaffe said that to simplify accounting procedures foreign radio 
stations paid the studio in full for each broadcast prepared by a 
reporter the station kept part of it for use of the facilities 
and passed the rest on to the reporter he said 
the ministry and yaffe acknowledged that the ministry held 
briefings for reporters using the studio 
sometimes somebody from there the foreign ministry says if 
you want we have such and such a guy who will talk to you about 
something yaffe said he said it was left up to the reporters 
whether to attend 
connie mus chief of the foreign press association and a 
reporter for the christian broadcast network said he was concerned 
over the reports this undermines the position of every 
journalist working in this country he said 
professional journalists should be independent if theyre 
paid by the foreign ministry it discredits the entire press 
corps

prosecutors and mayor marion barrys attorneys 
finished presenting evidence monday in the mayors drug and perjury 
trial and barry pleaded with the citys black residents to avoid 
reacting violently if he is convicted 
we have grown as a people in the last 20 years and we are not 
going to destroy what we have brought back barry said after the 
court session ended those who talk about that dont represent 
me 
barry scoffed at conjecture that rioting could occur like that 
which happened in the nations capital when the rev martin luther 
king was assassinated in 1968 
frankly i really dont see rioting happening no matter what 
happens barry said i want to say i have heard no serious 
consideration of anything like that 
the evidentiary phase of the trial came to an unexpected early 
ending when barrys lawyers abandoned an effort to call two 
witnesses they had hoped could weaken the governments case on one 
of the 10 cocainepossession charges the mayor faces 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson then set 
closing arguments for wednesday morning providing an extra day to 
prepare them as barrys lawyers had requested 
on friday prosecutors introduced a document showing city worker 
clifton roberson was absent from his job at the time roberson said 
he had accepted a job application from admitted crack cocaine 
dealer lydia pearson 
pearson had testified that she delivered the application along 
with crack cocaine to the mayor about 10 am sept 7 1988 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy said roberson was absent from 
his job later in the day but was there in the morning to get the 
application 
mundy said he had wanted to recall roberson but decided against 
it monday because the worker couldnt be dead certain about 
what happened on sept 7 
at issue is whether roberson was absent from 430 pm to 630 
pm as the form originally indicated or whether he was away from 
the office from 830 am until 1030 pm the latter time was 
listed in the margin above the original 430 pm entry which had 
been scratched out 
mundy said roberson could testify to being away from work late 
in the day but couldnt be as certain about who had made the 
handwritten change 
he doesnt think it is his handwriting but he cant say for 
sure mundy said he just cant recall that precisely 
on friday prosecutors called a former clerk in robersons 
office who identified the handwriting on the form as that of the 
defense witness 
the document is a brandnew piece of evidence that should 
not be admitted unless the defense is given a chance to dispute 
it mundy had originally argued 
jackson was considering mundys request until the defense 
attorney informed the court that he would not be calling either 
roberson or his mother mundy had said earlier he wanted to call 
robersons mother for verification roberson had scribbled on the 
city document that he was laying a stone for his fathers grave 
assistant us attorney richard roberts opened the days 
proceedings by saying the government would not call any more 
rebuttal witnesses 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession three felony charges of lying to a federal grand jury 
and one count of conspiracy

the fight over the toughest state abortion 
law in the nation entered federal court monday as a group of 
doctors and abortion clinics asked a judge to throw out key 
sections of the law 
the case is being watched by activists on both sides of the 
abortion debate because of its potential to present a challenge to 
the landmark roe vs wade decision that in 1973 established a 
womans right to have an abortion 
the classaction suit argues that abortion controls passed by 
the pennsylvania legislature in 1988 and 1989 unconstitutionally 
infringe on the rights of women to obtain abortions 
among the provisions in dispute are requirements that a woman 
notify her husband before obtaining an abortion and that she wait 
24 hours between visiting a clinic and receiving an abortion 
other contested sections require that doctors provide counseling 
to women seeking abortions and that minors obtain the written 
consent of one parent or a court order to receive an abortion 
the law has been temporarily blocked by a federal court order 
pending a ruling 
only guam a us territory in the pacific has adopted more 
stringent controls its law also was temporarily blocked 
kathryn kolbert an american civil liberties union attorney 
representing the plaintiffs said the law allows the state to 
interject itself into the private affairs of women and their 
doctors eroding privacy rights established under the roe ruling 
this act puts government in the operating room and at the 
kitchen table with women making decisions on abortion she said 
it questions the ability of women to make independent 
decisions she added 
one doctor testified that criminal penalties in the 1989 law 
might deter other physicians from performing abortions the law as 
revised last year carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate 
its provisions 
dr thomas allen of womens health services of pittsburgh one 
of the clinics filing suit said malpractice insurance typically 
covers civil but not criminal cases 
they are a little more afraid of the prospect of criminal 
charges allen said it may deter some of my colleagues from

unita rebels in angola killed 22 
civilians blew up electric pylons and sabotaged 14 oil pipelines 
undermining efforts to end the 15yearold civil war there news 
reports from angola said monday 
rebels confirmed sabotage attacks in the southern african 
nation but david horacio unita spokesman in lisbon said 
civilians were never a target 
the united states has backed unita the national union for the 
total independence of angola in its fight to force the marxist 
government to share power war has raged since angola gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 
the angolan news agency angop in a dispatch monitored in 
lisbon quoted an unidentified military source as saying rebels 
killed 20 villagers wounded two and burned seven houses in a raid 
thursday in coastal benguela province 
rebels killed two more civilians the same day one from namibia 
in an ambush on two vehicles in southern cunene province bordering 
namibia angop said 
angolan government sources quoted by the portuguese news agency 
lusa said unita blew up electric pylons 100 miles south of luanda 
leaving the capital without power for the second time in less than 
a month 
the angolan military said in a statement that rebel attacks on 
angolas oil supply are intended to display a false military 
superiority but in no way contribute to the advent of peace on the 
contrary they lead to an escalation of the internal conflict 
angop reported 
oil production at quinguila in northwestern soyo district 
bordering zaire was down 30000 barrels a day after unita destroyed 
14 pipelines there angop said 
crude oil is angolas main source of foreign currency the 
country produced an average 455000 barrels a day last year and 
stands to earn more than 25 billion from oil exports this year 
according to western studies 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva of portugal said recently the 
two sides may meet in august in portugal to sign a ceasefire 
a us state department official said during a visit to angola 
this month that the the united states will continue to aid the 
rebels until such time as there is a process for national 
reconciliation under way washington is thought to channel about 
50 million worth of military aid to unita mostly via zaire 
rebel and government delegations met in april and june in 
portugal for peace talks and both sides said later they were ready 
to sign a truce 
a june 22 1989 ceasefire brokered by president mobutu sese 
seko of zaire collapsed within days

loyalist soldiers of president samuel 
doe burst into a lutheran church compound monday and massacred at 
least 600 civilian refugees including many children witnesses 
said 
however state department officials in washington said late 
monday that their information based on reports from us embassy 
staff still in monrovia indicates about 200 had been killed by 
liberian troops 
in either case a spokesman for doe denied the allegations in a 
telephone call to the british broadcasting corp in london the 
spokesman said rebels wearing government uniforms killed the 
civilians in the early morning raid 
witnesses said most victims were children and women some with 
babies strapped to their backs and others cowering in corners they 
had been seeking refuge from the civil war which began in late 
december when rebels invaded from neighboring ivory coast in a bid 
to oust doe 
the rebels accuse doe in power since 1980 of rights abuses and 
corruption 
people who said they escaped the attack alleged about 30 
soldiers blasted the church door down with machines guns they then 
opened fire on about 2000 people from the gio and mano tribes who 
had taken refuge there 
government troops have killed hundreds of gios and manos whose 
tribes have supported the rebels seeking to overthrow doe and speak 
a different language than does loyalists most of does troops are 
from his krahn tribe and the mandingo tribe 
earlier monday white house deputy press secretary stephen hart 
said us embassy officials had confirmed government troops 
slaughtered at least 200 people at the church compound in monrovia 
there was no independent confirmation of the 600 dead figure 
the white house condemned the massacre as a senseless act of 
terror but had no plans to send in troops at this point we 
dont believe that would be a prudent course of action hart said 
witnesses said soldiers broke into the church compound at about 
2 am when the refugees were asleep there was no telephone so 
victims had no way of calling for help 
bodies of some people apparently killed while trying to flee 
were hanging from window frames of the church building said one 
person who visited the camp i saw dead bodies all around the 
source said speaking on condition of anonymity 
other witnesses who refused to give their names said they saw 
women with their heads smashed open or blown to pieces by bullets 
thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war are crowded into 
refugee camps in the capital their numbers have swelled recently 
as rebel troops have stormed the city 
the survivors said that after the soldiers had riddled the 
refugees on the ground floor with bullets they went upstairs and 
attacked a second group of 1000 sleeping there 
we thought they had come to ask us questions then they 
started killing and everyone began screaming and trying to hide 
said one man who claimed he hid on the roof of the church 
the soldiers were from does krahn tribe said the survivors 
the floor of the church was covered with blood stains monday 
bodies were huddled under the pews where people tried to hide and 
lay draped across the church altar more bodies were huddled in the 
corner 
the bodies of women were strewn on the floor with children still 
wrapped in shawls on their backs the ceiling was riddled with 
bullet holes 
my people help me my son where is my son i beg you dont 
leave me pleaded an injured woman on the church steps a man 
nearby his neck slashed called out for water 
the compound was filled with the bodies brought outside after 
the massacre people passing the church appeared numb at the sight 
of rows of corpses 
people who survived the attack were seen monday afternoon being 
rounded up by government soldiers the soldiers ordered survivors 
away from the building and shot into the air to make them move 
said the witnesses 
refugees had sought protection at the church in late may after 
government soldiers attacked them at un headquarters in monrovia 
the soldiers killed an unarmed security guard and abducted about 30 
civilian men many of their bodies were later discovered outside 
the capital 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar withdrew all un 
staff from liberia in protest halting an emergency program to aid 
war refugees perez de cuellar said in new york that he reacted 
with horror and dismay to mondays massacre 
the war has grown to include tribal warfare with both the 
government and rebels accusing the other of civilian slayings 
the government of neighboring guinea has accused fighters of 
rebel leader charles taylor of crossing into its territory and 
slaughtering krahns and mandingos 
meanwhile taylors men are engaged in battles with followers of 
a rival rebel leader prince johnson johnson split with taylor 
months ago and his fighters last week advanced to within a mile of 
the presidential mansion 
taylor has offered to pardon johnson if he joined in the 
struggle to topple doe 
johnson indicated monday he had no intention of working with 
taylor in a meeting with foreign correspondents in monrovia he 
accused taylor of being a libyanbacked socialist and said he 
received 8 million in aid from libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
he is not going to come here now and make himself president i 
will meet taylor after doe is overthrown i dont want power i 
want a fair election taylor will manipulate the election 
johnson said 
johnson a former lieutenant in does army said i will get 
doe he is not going to get away he claimed to have 7000 men 
under his command including 4000 deserters from does army 
taylor claims to have at least 5000 fighters he has denied 
receiving aid from libya 
taylor named his own interim government with himself as the 
head last week 
doe who has repeatedly said he will die before leaving 
monrovia remained holed up in his heavily fortified presidential 
mansion

hundreds of inmates at prisons across france 
refused to return to their cells monday in a new wave of protests 
against presidential pardons for five members of a proiranian 
assassination team 
the largest protest was at the strasbourgelsau prison outside 
the eastern city of strasbourg where about 200 of the 640 inmates 
refused to return to their cells after an afternoon walk 
about 40 protesters climbed atop a roof and refused to come down 
until riot police fired tear gas grenades to end the threehour 
rebellion one inmate suffered unspecified injuries when he fell 
from the roof police said 
similar protests began late in the day in at least six other 
prisons from marseille on the south coast to lille in the 
farnorth they followed a series of protests over the weekend by 
inmates angered over president francois mitterrands friday pardon 
of anis naccache and his four accomplices five prison officials 
were slightly injured in the weekend protests 
naccache had served 10 years of a life sentence for the failed 
assassination of shahpour bakhtiar irans prime minister prior to 
the 1979 islamic revolution 
a policeman and a passerby were killed and another policeman 
paralyzed in the 1980 assassination attempt in paris 
naccache was allegedly acting on iranian orders and his 
imprisonment has been a major object of contention between france 
and iran 
foreign minister roland dumas said in an interview saturday that 
he hoped the release could help bring about the freeing of all 
western hostages held in lebanon 
three unions representing prison guards issued statements 
partially blaming the government for the protests one of them the 
general union of prison syndicates said the pardons confirm once 
again that all men in france are not equal before the law 
at the ormingen prison in eastern france scores of prisoners 
ended an 18hour mutiny monday in which they hurled roofing tiles 
at riot police and set fire to the kitchen gymnasium and prison 
shop many were armed with iron bars or hand tools 
the riot police did not intervene and the inmates gave up at 
midday monday following hours of negotiations with prison officials 
no promises were made to the prisoners officials said they 
could not immediately provide an estimate of the damages caused to 
the facility 
there were also protests at caen where the five prison 
employees were slightly injured saturday the inmates there 
demanding pardons of their own had chanted us too us too 
the paris newspaper le monde reported monday that iran may also 
be seeking the release of two other men serving life prison terms 
in france georges ibrahim abdallah a lebanese convicted in 1987 
of complicity in the assassinations of diplomats from the united 
states and israel and varoujan garbidjian an armenian convicted 
of a 1983 bombing at orly airport which killed eight people

mediabesieged jail where she chose to spend her 72hour sentence 
for slapping a beverly hills police officer virtually ending her 
publicitymad misdemeanor case 
surrounded by about 100 reporters and onlookers and at least one 
heckler who told her to go back to hungary miss gabor 72 said 
she spent her jail time doing secretarial work that was slightly 
hampered by her ignorance of the alphabet 
i had to file but i dont know the abcs so they wrote out 
the abcde for me she said outside the jail i did very well 
miss gabor said that on returning to her belair home i want 
to take a hot bath and talk to my dogs and my horses 
retired custodian fred degrazio 72 of hawthorne documented the 
release with a video camera and running commentary i have 
nothing else to do he explained 
she should go back to hungary and be the aristocrat she thinks 
she is he said shortly before miss gabors release 
why dont you jump in a coffin snapped her husband 
frederick von anhalt who says hes a prince von anhalt miss 
gabors eighth husband said the previous 72 hours had been tough 
on him 
my weekend was terrible my wife she wasnt home he 
complained 
on friday miss gabor began her 72hour sentence for slapping a 
policeman during a traffic stop last year 
she paid 85 a day to do her time at the el segundo jail rather 
than have the county pick accommodations for her 
i was very happily surprised she said of her stay in the 
los angeles suburb known for its refineries and aerospace offices 
and factories everybody was warm and nice and sweet it was ok 
the beverly hills police should come and take lessons from this 
police 
but there was that moment of terror 
at first i was petrified she said they even took my 
makeup away she also scolded reporters for a weekend story that 
her husband delivered silk sheets to the jail 
i didnt have silk sheets i dont even have silk sheets at 
home i was on a horse blanket she said 
she also declared the food to be terrible 
among other accomplishments during the 72 hours miss gabor 
claimed she finished writing her autobiography one lifetime is 
not enough 
one jail stay was enough for the el segundo police 
this is so timeconsuming lt l lunsford said sunday 
after handling about 60 telephone calls from people with inquiring 
minds 
municipal judge charles rubin ordered the jail sentence last may 
after ruling miss gabor had violated probation by failing to 
perform 120 hours of community service at a shelter for homeless 
women he increased the communityservice time to 145 hours 
along with her jail time and community service rubin ordered 
miss gabor to pay nearly 13000 in fines and restitution 
miss gabors attorney harrison bull of santa barbara said 
finishing the jail sentence completes the sometime actress debt to 
society 
i filed notice of completion last week i am going to say she 
completed more than 200 hours of community service considerably 
more than she was asked to do said bull 
of the 13000 in fines 10000 has been paid and the rest will 
be paid this week he said 
this is probably the biggest sentence ever served by anyone 
for such a minor incident in the history of united states 
jurisprudence bull said with the understatement that has marked 
the case

the worlds largest collection of forestry 
scientists called monday for radical changes in forest research 
pleading for more money more graduate students and a broader view 
of the globes ecosystem 
the society of american foresters embraced proposed changes of a 
new report by the national research council an affiliate of the 
national academy of science 
by and large the current extent and direction of forestry 
research is insufficient to answer todays pressing problems or 
those of the future said arthur smyth president of the society 
and its nearly 20000 members 
we are facing serious environmental questions about global 
warming and biodiversity yet we find our countrys commitment to 
forestry research is eroding just when we most need to understand 
and look for solutions to these pressing concerns he said 
the report presented at the societys annual convention in 
washington concludes that current forestry research is inadequate 
to meet societys needs 
support for research physical facilities and research equipment 
is lagging and because funding has not kept pace with changing 
technology the technology used in forestry research and teaching 
is rarely up to date 
the number of scientists and amount of resources devoted to 
forestry research have declined significantly and are continuing to 
decline even as needs increase the study said 
the report recommends the forest services research budget be 
increased by 10 percent annually over the next five years from the 
1988 level of 135 million to a total of 218 million it also 
suggests the agriculture department make available 100 million 
annually in competitive grants for research 
jerry sesco deputy chief of research for the agriculture 
departments forest service said forest research has been 
conducted by scientists with specific expertise in such areas as 
water timber and wildlife 
we need more at the interdisciplinary ecosystem level it 
goes back to the first earth day when we said everything is related 
to everything else we are finding that is true more and more he 
said 
basically we dont know very much about how ecosystems 
operate we need to understand better how people and natural 
resources integrate sesco said 
the committee that prepared information for the report was 
chaired by john c gordon of yale university other members 
included william atkinson of oregon state university jerry 
franklin and david thorud of the university of washington and james 
sedell of the forest service in corvallis ore

a bomb hidden under a car exploded 
monday killing a conservative party lawmaker and confidante of the 
prime minister who was on an irish republican army assassination 
list police said 
ian gow chairman of the northern ireland committee in the house 
of commons died of injuries minutes after turning the ignition key 
in his car outside his house authorities said 
scotland yards chief antiterrorist officer george 
churchillcoleman said the attack appeared to be the work of the 
ira no one else was injured and no one immediately claimed 
responsibility 
prime minister margaret thatcher viewed the car with its roof 
on the drivers side peeled back and all the glass blown out 
i could talk to him like nobody else she said of gow after 
visiting his wife 
gow 53 had been warned he was on a list of 100 lawmakers 
judges and civil servants found in an ira bomb factory in south 
london in december 1988 churchillcoleman said 
friends and neighbors in hankham on englands southeast coast 
said gow took few precautions it would be easy for terrorists to 
get him said jane birch a neighbor 
it appeared that a device packing about five pounds of 
explosives was placed under the drivers seat set to go off when 
the ignition was turned on churchillcoleman said 
my impression is that it was some sort of tilt switch once 
you turn it on it explodes immediately he said 
gow was prime minister margaret thatchers parliamentary private 
secretary from 1979 to 1983 he was also a close family friend and 
political ally to whom she turned for advice in moments of 
difficulty 
gow resigned from her government in 1985 to protest the 
angloirish agreement which guaranteed ireland a say in the 
provinces affairs he saw the accord as undermining british 
authority in northern ireland 
irish prime minister charles haughey and britains roman 
catholic cardinal basil hume joined politicians in condemning the 
attack the fourth slaying of a british lawmaker since sectarian 
violence broke out in northern ireland in 1969 
the ira has claimed responsiblity for a series of bombings in 
england including one on may 16 that killed sgt charles chapman 
at a british army recruiting office 
other recent targets have included londons stock exchange the 
carlton club a traditional conservative party watering hole the 
stock exchange and a royal air force base in northwest london 
in washington the state department condemned the killing and 
offered condolences to gows family 
gows killers were plain common murderers mrs thatcher 
said after spending nearly an hour with gows wife jane at the 
couples home near eastbourne 60 miles southeast of london 
mrs thatcher went to a special private service for gow 
she said the gows and their two sons spent some christmases with 
the thatchers and that the families were close 
the prime minister who narrowly escaped an ira bombing that 
killed five at a hotel in brighton during a conservative party 
meeting in october 1984 said public officials should take all 
precautions suggested by scotland yard 
most members of parliament want to lead an open life but i 
must renew the plea in view of what happened here in a quiet 
village everyone must have regard for their own stafety and the 
safety of their staff and family mrs thatcher said 
police scoured the area trying to discover whether the bombers 
stayed in the locale before the attack 
nearly a dozen bouquets of flowers were placed near the gate to 
the drive the large brick house stands behind a high wall across 
the street from a primary school closed for summer vacation 
i think if ian had been here he would have been the first to 
say as he did on countless other occasions when such atrocities 
occurred we should not give in to intimidation said 
conservative lawmaker charles wardle it is vitally important 
that nothing should change peoples minds no atrocity no murder 
no bullying 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party called the 
slaying a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offense was 
to speak his mind 
last tuesday after an ira bomb killed three police officers and 
a nun in northern ireland gow expressed his anger at ira tactics 
these murders are as odious as they are futile he said 
once again wives have been turned into widows and children into 
orphans and for what purpose 
in a june 28 issue of republican news the weekly newspaper of 
the ira a leader said the group was determined to hit the enemy 
on as many fronts as possible and to stretch their resources and 
nerves 
england is the belly of the beast and that is where it hurts 
most the unidentified ira leader said

a house armed services subcommittee voted 
monday to eliminate all 38 billion in procurement money president 
bush had sought for the b2 bomber lawmakers said 
the panel on procurement and military nuclear systems adopted 
the proposal of its chairman rep les aspin dwis to stop 
buying the stealth aircraft after the 15 planes currently under 
development are delivered to the air force 
the armed services subcommittee on research and development 
meets tuesday to take up the presidents requets for money for b2 
testing the full committee meets later in the day to put the 
finishing touches on its 283 billion defense bill for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 
in other action behind closed doors the panel eliminated the 
13 billion the pentagon sought for the program to move the mx 
nuclear missile from fixed silos to railroad cars and zeroed out 
the 13 billion for the amraam antiaircraft missile 
rejecting defense secretary dick cheneys attempts to kill the 
v22 osprey the house panel added 165 million for advance 
procurement of the tiltrotor assault transport that takes off like 
a helicopter but can fly like a plane 
the panel also restricted the purchase of the c17 transport 
aircraft requiring cheney to certify that the planes first 
successful flight has been demonstrated before some 350 million 
can be spent on the two planes sought in the new fiscal year the 
administration had proposed spending 21 billion on the c17 a 
hevay transport designed to land on fields that the gigantic c5 
models cannot use 
the panel slashed 12 billion from the classified a12 navy 
attack aircraft program 
the subcommittees action on the b2 reflected the eroding 
congressional support for the aircraft which is manufactured by 
the northrop corp lawmakers have expressed sticker shock over the 
cost of a single plane nearly 865 million 
the b2 still has substantial support in the senate 
a serious blow to the program came last week when aspin 
chairman of the house armed services panel came out for winding up 
the program despite attempts by the administration to make the 
project more appealing to lawmakers 
cheney revised his plan for the aircraft in april cutting the 
total number of planes to be bought from 132 to 75 and reducing the 
buy in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 from five to two 
in the closed session the panel by voice vote rejected an 
amendment by rep ike skelton dmo to include 200 million for 
future procurement of the stealth bomber 
instead the subcommittee followed aspins lead and zeroed out 
38 billion for procurement of the two planes

forecasters said minimal hurricane bertha could 
reach the canadian provinces by wednesday but was mainly of concern 
to marine interests 
bertha which was downgraded sunday night to a tropical storm 
after it temporarily weakened regained enough strength to push it 
just over the hurricane threshold of 74 mph 
at 6 pm edt monday bertha was centered near 36 degrees 5 
minutes north latitude and 67 degrees 4 minutes west longitude 
that is 600 miles southsouthwest of halifax nova scotia said 
forecasters at the national hurricane center in suburban coral 
gables it had top sustained winds of 75 mph and was moving 
northeast at 14 mph 
bertha was expected to stay at the same strength course and 
speed through early tuesday said forecaster miles lawrence 
earlier bertha kicked up surf along carolina beaches and sent 
gusts up to about 45 mph toward bermuda but forecasters said that 
because it was already edging northeast toward the open atlantic 
when it was born it was never much of a threat 
the first hurricane of the 1990 atlantic season could reach the 
canadian provinces of nova scotia and newfoundland by wednesday or 
thursday forecasters said

fire devastated naples new courthouse 
monday turning the 32story building into a glass inferno one 
firefighter was slightly injured 
the fire was discovered on the 7th floor of the 360foot tower 
the tallest in a threebuilding complex that was to have been 
completed the end of this year construction of the building began 
in 1979 
the cause of the fire which resulted in an estimated 1 billion 
worth of damage is under investigation 
so far nothing has emerged that points to arson said enzo 
mauro a deputy at the district police station the construction 
company however excluded the possibility that the origin of the 
fire was electrical 
firefighters were hindered in their efforts to extinguish the 
rapidlyspreading fire because of the heavy shower of debris that 
rained down as sections of the ironandglass tower collapsed 
an automatic fireextinguishing system had been designed for the 
building but was not yet functional 
officials had hoped the opening of the new judicial complex 
would help alleviate a huge backlog of criminal cases many 
involving the neapolitan mafia

a red fourdoor saturn sedan piloted 
by retiring general motors chairman roger smith rolled off the 
assembly line monday ceremonially but secretly kicking off 
production of the groundbreaking car 
gm said that smith who retires tuesday after 9 years as gms 
chairman drove and united auto workers union president owen bieber 
rode shotgun when the job one of the new gm model came off the 
line 
smith had promised he would drive job one off saturns 
assembly line before he retired 
but after seven years of media hype since the project was 
announced the ceremony was closed to the news media 
a photographer at mondays ceremony was barred from taking 
pictures of the entire vehicle reporters wre kept outside the 
plant gates and departing employees refused to answer questions 
the company has yet to officially release a picture of the car but 
socalled spy photos have been published 
in contrast when nissan began making light trucks in 1983 in 
smyrna 25 miles to the northeast its job one ceremony was a 
carefully produced affair with speeches a film of the plants 
history and open access for the news media 
richard g skip lefauve gm saturns president said in a 
news release that saturns ceremony was private because of gms 
plans to focus national attention on the cars launch this fall he 
said it also provided a chance for team members to talk with smith 
without roger there wouldnt be a saturn he said 
the saturn project was envisioned as a way of using 
nontraditional production and management techniques to make cars 
that would compete with imports that steadily have eaten away gms 
us market share 
smith introduced the project in 1983 saying the company planned 
to annually make 500000 subcompact cars costing about 6000 each 
and getting mileage of 60 miles per gallon 
the final product actually has more interior room a longer 
wheel base and more features it now is aimed to compete with the 
honda civic and toyota corolla with a 10000 to 12000 price tag 
and a smaller 35mpg rating production estimates have been halved 
smiths promise to drive job one off the assembly line 
before he retired also was modified when pressed recently if he 
would be able to keep his promise smith and saturn officials said 
he would drive the car only if it was ready for production 
production is coming on line retail facilities are under 
construction and we cant wait to get to the marketplace this 
fall said lefauve 
behind smith and bieber was incoming gm chairman robert stempel 
in the job two saturn 
saturn officials said they will not begin shipping cars until 
the fall shortly before they go on sale in october

east germanys deposed communist leader erich 
honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be 
tried the official news agency adn reported monday 
adn quoting a health ministry statement said honecker was 
still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in january and was 
not well enough to be incarcerated 
but a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition 
to be questioned and to stand trial adn said 
honecker 77 ruled east germany for 19 years until he was 
ousted in october as a wave of prodemocracy demonstrations swept 
the country leading to the peaceful overthrow of the communist 
government and the opening of the berlin wall 
the medical panel concluded that seven other former communist 
officials who had been among honeckers closest aides were all 
fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody adn said 
it said former secret police chief erich mielke former 
economics czar guenter mittag and former labor chief harry tisch 
were under arrest while the other four remained free all three 
had been members of the ruling politburo under honecker mielke was 
arrested on thursday 
honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of 
office they had been arrested soon after honeckers fall but were 
later released because of advanced age and poor health 
honecker has been staying at a soviet military hospital outside 
east berlin 
adn quoted federal prosecutor guenter seidel as saying he 
intended to continue his investigation against the former east 
german leaders although their poor health often disrupted the 
proceedings

the senate on monday voted to use 20 million 
in public money for senate candidates tv commercials drawing on 
the presidential campaign fund supported by the 1 checkoff on 
individual income tax returns 
republicans called the proposal a food stamp voucher for 
politicians that would open the door to taxpayer financing to pay 
most of the cost of congressional campaigns as it does now with 
presidential elections 
underneath the hood its the same old lemon running on 
taxpayer financing and spending limits said kentucky sen mitch 
mcconnell the leading republican opponent to the democratic bill 
by a 4946 vote the senate rejected a republican amendment that 
would delete from a campaign finance reform bill a measure to give 
senate nominees 180000 to 11 million each in government 
vouchers to buy broadcasting time for abiding by voluntary spending 
ceilings demanded by democrats 
all 44 republicans present voted for the amendment by mcconnell 
democrats howell heflin of alabama and james exxon of nebraska also 
bolted from their party to support it 
beginning debate on campaign finance reform that both parties 
claim to want to address a growing public cynicism about politics 
in the wake of the savings and loan scandal democrats and 
republicans remained at logger heads over the idea of spending 
ceilings 
majority democrats as they have for years continued to insist 
on statebystate limits on how much candidates can raise and spend 
to win or keep senate seats 
anything short of that only creates the appearance of 
reform said democratic leader george mitchell of maine thats 
the central issue dividing the two parties 
republicans last week offered to accept flexible ceilings 
exempting instate contributions and gifts from outofstate donors 
less than 200 but democrats rejected anything less than an 
absolute aggregate ceiling 
republicans contended monday any bill limiting spending would 
stifle challengers and allow democrats to maintain control of both 
houses of congress 
everybody knows this is not going anywhere because its a 
spendinglimit bill that the president will not sign said senate 
gop leader bob dole of kansas 
dole said republicans would not attempt to filibuster the bill 
as they did two years ago successfully beating back eight attempts 
by democrats to have the chamber vote on it 
both sides acknowledged that any agreement with president bush 
is not likely until congress returns from its august vacation 
in addition to the public financing of vouchers the democratic 
bill also provides discount mail subsidies to candidates abiding by 
the spending limits as well as funds to counter broadcast ads by 
independent groups costing over 10000 
additional public financing would also be provided to candidates 
whose opponents exceed the voluntary spending ceilings 
mcconnells amendment would have eliminated all those potential 
public sources of money in the bill 
in the house speaker thomas s foley said he hopes to bring 
widely different versions of campaignreform measures to the floor 
before the house recesses at weeks end 
unlike the senate versions two democratic alternatives and a 
republican version in the house would all diminish the role of 
labor corporate and trade association pacs but would not eliminate 
them like their senate counterparts house democrats are insisting 
on spending ceilings while house republicans oppose them 
i think we might have to consider having separate procedures 
for the house and senate said foley a washington democrat 
obviously some features applying to state parties would have to 
be consolidated 
house democrats would establish a spending ceiling of 550000 
roughly half the average spent by winners in the 1988 house 
elections 
the democraticproposed limits on senate races based on the 
size of a states votingage population range from slightly under 
2 million in smaller states such as nevada montana and north 
dakota to 103 million in the largest state california 
mitchell attempted to refute republican claims that a spending 
ceiling would benefit incumbents and maintain a democratic majority 
any limits will benefit challengers because incumbents have 
the greatest access to money mitchell said citing the 1986 and 
1988 senate elections in which incumbents outspent challengers in 
51 of 55 races by a total of more than 100 million 
republicans countered that six successful challengers in those 
elections four republicans and two democrats spent more than 
the democratic bill would allow 
senate democrats bowed to republicans in agreeing to abolish 
pacs friday and agreed to remove from their bill a publicfinancing 
provision that would have financed up to 70 percent of a 
candidates general election campaign through a voluntary taxpayer 
checkoff 
republicans for example want to disallow the use of free 
franked mail by incumbent senators in election years and 
prohibit such efforts as the 45million unionsponsored 1988 
voterregistration and getoutthevote drive which mostly 
benefited democrats

the state department said monday there are no 
plans for us military intervention to bring an end to the 
moslemled insurrection against the elected government in trinidad 
while refusing comment on reports of us military maneuvers in 
the area deputy spokesman richard boucher suggested that a 
military solution had been ruled out 
at the same time boucher criticized libyas involvement with 
the rebels saying it has provided some training for the 
insurgents but he said there was no apparent direct link between 
libya and hostagetaking which occurred last friday 
abu bakr the leader of a moslem sect launched the coup attempt 
by seizing the parliament building in portofspain and capturing 
prime minister arthur nr robinson and about 40 other hostages 
robinson and one other goverment minister were believed to have 
been shot in the leg early in the coup attempt and both have been 
getting medical attention said bernard w aronson assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
trinidad government spokesman gregory shaw identified the second 
victim as justice minister selwyn richardson and said both men 
were in stable condition shaw said robinson had been shot in both 
feet not the legs 
aronson who spoke in an interview on the macneillehrer 
newshour on the public broadcasting system also said people were 
killed in the coup attempt but said the department did not have a 
figure on the casualties he said none of them was a highranking 
government official but he declined to identify the victims 
further 
the trinidad crisis has some of the earmarks of the situation in 
grenada seven years ago when a radical leftist movement took power 
in that case the united states and several other caribbean 
countries decided to oust the radicals 
as in grenada the insurgents have shown a willingness to use 
extremist methods to advance their cause 
in both grenada and trinidad there were signs of involvement by 
antiamerican elements from abroad in grenada the leadership 
there had close links to cuba while in trinidad libya has been 
allied with the rebels also in both cases a major concern of 
washington has been the well being of thousands of americans 
residing in the two countries 
but a major difference between the two situations is that 
whereas virtually all of the americans in grenada were students at 
a medical school the 6000 americans in trinidad are dispersed 
around the island and are less vulnerable to a mass hostagetaking 
the international political climate also has undergone a 
dramatic transformation since 1983 a period when cold war tensions 
were at a peak 
there is little indication that the events in trinidad will have 
an impact beyond that countrys borders this was not the case in 
1983 when members of the organization of eastern caribbean states 
asked for the dispatch of us troops 
beyond that american officials said government officials in 
trinidad have indicated a desire to resolve the crisis without 
outside help

the house acted monday to protect the grand 
canyon from any further damage from the hydroelectric functions of 
the nearby glen canyon dam 
a bill approved by voice vote directs the interior department to 
operate the dam on the colorado river in arizona in a such a way 
that natural cultural and recreational resources downstream in the 
grand canyon are protected or improved 
rep george miller dcalif sponsor of the bill said that for 
more than 25 years the dam has been diverting water through power 
turbines upstream of grand canyon at times of peak electricity 
demand 
this has caused fluctuations in water flow that has hurt 
wildlife in the canyon and frequently left rafters stranded on sand 
bars conservationists argued 
enviornmentalists filed lawsuits demanding that the interior 
department do an environmental impact statement analyzing dam 
operations in 1988 a sixyear study concluded that the dam was 
damaging the canyon environment and last july the interior 
department announced that it would prepare the environmental impact 
statement 
the current management of this dam is a national 
embarrassement miller said the primary purpose of this bill 
is to take immediate and lasting steps to protect the resources of 
the grand canyon 
millers bill requires the interior department to take interim 
steps pending completion of the impact statement to protect the 
environment and mitigate and damage that has already taken place 
it directs the department to take longterm steps for operation 
of the dam after the impact statement is completed 
the bill still must be approved by the senate

occupied west bank and israeli authorities said two separate arab 
guerrilla cells have been uncovered 
in mondays clashes in the occupied territories 10 palestinians 
were wounded arab reporters said the army confirmed three wounded 
and said it was checking further 
arab reports identified the shooting victim as saher baarah 15 
of the west bank city of nablus who was shot in the head saturday 
night baarah died monday at the tel hashomer hospital in tel aviv 
the army confirmed that a palestinian had died from a plastic 
bullet wound sustained during clashes saturday with stonethrowing 
arab demonstrators in nablus 
baarahs death brought the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli gunfire during the 31monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation to 725 
at least 242 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most 
as suspected collaborators fortyfive israelis have also died in 
the violence 
also in nablus the military and the shin bet security service 
uncovered a guerrilla hideout used by a group calling itself the 
revolutionary security service affiliated with yasser arafats 
fatah wing of the palestine liberation organization the army said 
the hideout a wellconcealed cave dug under a house contained 
a rifle and machine gun four pistols a large amount of 
ammunition knives and other military equipment the army said 
investigators also found two identity cards belonging to arabs 
killed as suspected collaborators this year another identity card 
found in the cave belonged to a palestinian who was badly wounded 
by an axe last april the army said 
the group has attacked and violently interrogated dozens of 
palestinians it suspected of collaborating with israel during the 
uprising the army said 
eleven members of the group were captured in nablus last month 
israeli authorities also released information about another 
fatah guerrilla cell whose six members all israeli arabs were 
indicted by a military court in lod last week 
the indictment alleged the cell led by khaled hassan canaan 
from the village of tamra in western galilee planted bombs in two 
haifa shopping centers and on a beach in the northern town of 
nahariya the past year none of the bombs caused any injuries or 
damage 
the indictment said fatah had recruited canaan while he was 
studying law in west germany two years ago 
it alleged that the group received orders from highranking 
fatah officials in west germany and yugoslavia 
israeli officials said they had passed information on this fatah 
cell to the united states 
arafat the plo chairman renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist in december 1988 opening the way to direct 
talks with the united states 
the us administration suspended those talks in june after 
arafat failed to discipline the plo faction responsible for a 
foiled seaborne raid on a tel aviv beach

a man rescued monday 14 days after an 
earthquake buried him in the basement of a luxury hotel said that 
while trapped in the darkness he often wished he were dead and even 
tried to kill himself 
pedrito dy a cook and parttime fitness instructor was the 
third survivor pulled since friday from the ruins of the hyatt 
hotel in the northern resort of baguio he is one of the longest 
survivors of an earthquake on record 
dy 27 was flown to manila for medical treatment one doctor 
raul morena said dys athletic build protected him from serious 
injury in the july 16 quake that killed about 1600 people doctors 
said he suffered only from dehydration and low blood sugar which 
caused disorientation 
dy spent a peaceful night at manilas makati medical center 
where he was being fed dextrose and a soft diet doctors said 
tuesday they said dys blood sugar levels had returned to normal 
speaking from his hospital bed on monday dy said that while 
trapped he lay on his back beneath a cushion which protected him 
from the debris that shifted repeatedly in aftershocks 
he said he survived by drinking urine and rainwater 
i drank my urine sometimes drops of rainwater dy said i 
caught water with my mouth and scooped urine with the palm of my 
hand for 13 days i was telling myself i would die 
dys voice was barely audible his eyes were glazed and his 
conversation rambled from recollection to recollection without 
concern for the subject or sequence of time 
dy said he finished his shift as a cook at the 350room hotel 
and headed for the basement gymnasium to lead about a dozen 
employees in an afternoon workout 
suddenly the building shook and the force of the temblor hurled 
him against an exercise cushion hanging on a wall the wall 
collapsed but the cushion shielded him from serious injury 
while trapped dy said he was aware of the passage of time 
because a clock that had hung on the gym wall continued operating 
it struck every noon and midnight 
on the 13th day i told myself i wish i were dead he said 
i attempted to kill myself two times i banged my head on the 
wall i prayed constantly to the virgin mary and gave my life 
up to the lord then i wasnt scared anymore 
on sunday dy heard noises it was the tapping of filipino 
miners tunneling through the debris searching for survivors he 
called out for help 
alex fongafong a miner for philex mining corp heard the 
cries wedging himself through a narrow tunnel the miner found a 
small triangular opening peering inside he saw dy lying on his 
back 
well come back for you and we will bring you out fongafong 
shouted he returned later with mining engineer hector castillo 
who used a jackhammer to cut through a beam blocking dys escape 
after a couple of hours castillo said rescuers bored a 1foot 
hole and pulled dy into the passageway to freedom 
outside hundreds of rescuers and spectators cheered as dy and 
the others emerged early monday 
i am calling for my wife and parents im alive im alive 
dy told a radio reporter in ilocano the dialect of northern luzon 
island im ok 
later in manila dy told reporters he made a secret vow to 
the virgin mary during his days in darkness although he did not 
reveal what it was 
dy said he was among 12 people trapped in the basement of the 
hotel wing used to house employees but all the others had died 
the july 16 earthquake measured 77 on the richter scale 
besides the 1653 people killed 1000 are missing and presumed 
dead 3000 were seriously injured and 110000 were homeless 
foreign rescue teams in baguio abandoned the search for more 
survivors more than a week ago because they said sensor instruments 
indicated no more people were alive in the ruins of eight hotels 
baguio is 130 miles north of manila 
but filipino crews many of them volunteers continued the 
search there was renewed optimism after two survivors both hotel 
employees were pulled from the rubble where they had been trapped 
for 11 days 
the two luisa mallorca 20 a cleaning woman and arnel 
calabia 26 a guard were reported in good condition and were 
flown sunday from baguio to manila for medical treatment 
more than 50 people including 12 americans of filipino origin 
are still believed buried beneath the hyatt 
there have been other miraculous cases of earthquake survival in 
modern times but dy appears to be one of the longest survivors on 
record based on a review of associated press reports on other 
major recent quakes 
when a powerful earthquake struck san francisco on oct 21 
1989 rescuers pulled an oakland longshoreman buck helm from his 
car 89 hours afterward he died 28 days after his rescue 
the most celebrated survivors of a mexico city earthquake in 
september 1985 were the miracle babies found in the rubble of 
two maternity hospitals the newborns survived periods of 
entombment ranging from eight hours to almost nine days

a congressional conference committee approved 
a bill monday that would ban the export of unprocessed logs from 
most stateowned lands in the western states 
northwest lawmakers drafted the measure this spring to offset a 
shrinking timber supply as logging is prohibited on more and more 
public lands in an attempt to protect wildlife that inhabit 
oldgrowth forests including the rare northern spotted owl 
the proposal now goes to the floors of the house and the senate 
where approval is expected 
under the bill export of raw logs could continue on onefourth 
of the stateowned lands in washington but would be banned on all 
state lands in oregon california idaho montana nevada wyoming 
utah colorado arizona and new mexico hawaii and alaska are not 
affected 
backers of the proposal say it will keep at home about 600 
million board feet of timber threequarters of it in washington an 
oregon annually shipped to more lucrative markets overseas 
in each of the last two years about 36 billion board feet of 
unprocessed timber the bulk of it from private land has been 
exported from washington and oregon about 80 percent of the total 
national exports 
about one in four trees cut in the pacific northwest is shipped 
to foreign countries primarily japan 
when we are experiencing a tight timber supply as we are now 
in the northwest it makes absolutely no sense to be shipping raw 
logs overseas sen bob packwood rore said 
packwood and several other northwest lawmakers also advocate a 
ban on the export of raw logs from private lands but the bush 
administration as well as the timber industry strongly opposes that 
idea 
the bill would make permanent the temporary ban on raw log 
exports from federal lands in the western united states it also 
would close loopholes in the federal ban that allow some timber 
companies to obtain federal logs from a third party for their 
domestic mills while shipping their own private logs overseas

president alberto fujimori declared a twoday 
bank holiday monday to stop a run on the institutions as he 
prepares to unveil his economic program aimed at ending the 
countrys economic crisis 
fujimori sworn in saturday to a fiveyear term as president 
said the bank holiday would give his government time to implement 
the necessary measures to carry out our economic program 
the mandatory holiday took effect immediately and banks were 
closed throughout the country on monday 
also monday fujimori a political newcomer continued a major 
shakeup by firing four of the countrys top police officials the 
move follows his dismissal of the heads of the navy and air force 
over the weekend 
the government announced that new chiefs had been appointed to 
head the national police general police technical police and 
security police 
no specific reasons were given for the police changes in his 
inaugural address fujimori pledged a crackdown on official 
corruption 
fujimori said his governments economic program will be 
announced to the country on thursday or friday by prime minister 
and economy minister juan carlos hurtado 
the president has refused to discuss details of the drastic 
measures he has promised to try to turn perus economy around 
but he told reporters monday that the economic measures would 
not adversely affect peruvians savings 
quite the contrary he said we want to encourage 
peruvians to save and the measures are aimed at that goal 
fujimoris predecessor alan garcia left the new president with 
an economy that has collapsed 
annual inflation tops 3000 percent four of five people lack 
steady work and the government is virtually bankrupt 
fujimori has said he will cut price subsidies raise taxes and 
privatize many stateowned companies he has also said he would 
devalue perus inti to raise the dollars cost by 300 to 400 
percent 
last week many banks ran out of money leaving thousands of 
workers unable to cash their checks drivers formed blockslong 
gasoline lines and bread disappeared from poorer neighborhoods 
store shelves are often halfempty because merchants withhold 
supplies in expectation of higher prices 
also monday fujimori hosted a luncheon at the presidential 
palace for the nations top military and police officers 
the luncheon followed his decision last weekend to dismiss the 
heads of the navy and the air force 
on monday both branches of the military recognized the new 
commandersinchief appointed by fujimori hours after his 
inauguration 
fujimori dismissed gen german vucetich and adm alfonso panizo 
he named gen arnaldo velarde to head the air force and adm luis 
montes lecaros to command the navy 
fujimori did not given any reasons for the changes panizo and 
vucetich would normally have remained in their posts until the end 
of the year 
the president did not explain the reasons for the changes 
panizo and vucetich would have normally remained in their jobs 
until the end of this year 
vucetich said he does not know why he was dismissed and 
declared he would seek a meeting with fujimori to get an 
explanation 
vucetich was forced to retire and panizo was reassigned to a 
position in washington 
analysts said the dismissals were probably part of an effort to 
impose authority over the military and in line with fujimoris 
pledge to fight corruption 
vucetich had been accused of corruption earlier this year by a 
prominent television newsman the general denied the allegations 
panizo probably was fired because he was slow in denying rumors 
the military was plotting a coup if fujimori won junes 
presidential election the analysts said 
however fujimori has given the military a prominent role in his 
government three ministries defense interior and fisheries 
are headed by military officers 
fujimori 52 is an agronomist of japanese descent who won a 
landslide election victory in his first campaign for office over 
acclaimed novelist mario vargas llosa

a stepfather was convicted monday of 
murdering a toddler he plunged into a toilet as punishment for 
soiling his pants 
the case forced reforms in the way florida protects children 
considered at risk of child abuse 
it took jurors less than two hours of deliberation to convict 
thomas coe of firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse 
circuit judge randall mcdonald ordered the jury to reconvene 
wednesday to decide if coe should be sentenced to life in prison or 
death in the electric chair 
he deserves the electric chair said pam kirkland the 
childs foster mother for 14 months for what he did and the way 
he did it i think that would be an appropriate punishment 
coe 23 testified last week that he was out of control july 
27 1989 when he dunked his 2yearold stepson bradley mcgee 
into the toilet as punishment for soiling his pants the boy died 
the next day of massive injuries 
you have a confession from the man that was very damaging 
said prosecutor john aguero after the verdict 
defense attorneys slipped out a back entrance of the courthouse 
without answering reporters questions 
the state contended that the childs death was a malicious 
culmination of weeks of coes bizzare abuse 
but the defense said in closing arguments that the fatal dunking 
was an isolated incident in toilet training and that coes intent 
wasnt malicious coes attorney robert norgard argued coe should 
be convicted of a lesser offense 
all he meant to do was dunk bradleys head in the water to use 
the association with water to teach the child not to soil his 
pants norgard said in the heat of the moment he thought of 
something that was frankly unusual but he did not intend to hurt 
that child 
prosecutor john aguero countered there is no rational 
explanation for an irrational act this was a senseless killing 
bradleys death came two months after he was ordered returned 
from foster care to his mother sheryl mcgee coe and stepfather 
thomas coe 
mrs coe 21 has testified that during those two months her 
husband often forced the child to pick up feces with his mouth and 
ground his fist and cayenne pepper into the boys genitals 
she admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating the 
toddler with pillows just before he died she pleaded no contest to 
seconddegree murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a 
30year term 
norgard suggested that the jury find coe guilty of manslaughter 
citing the actual wording of the law as culpable negligence 
rather than an intentional act and reckless disregard for human 
life 
were not here to ask you to find coe not guilty that man 
did cross the line norgard said but hold this man responsible 
for what he did and not for what he didnt do 
medical experts have testified for the prosecution that when 
bradley died his body was covered with more than 50 bruises some 
of them more than two weeks old 
norgard also did his best to discredit the allegations of the 
principal state witenss sheryl coe saying she was trying to 
distance herself from the crime to make life easier on herself in 
prison 
because of news reports about the case the trial was moved from 
polk county where the death occurred to fort myers 
outrage over the case also led to the states passage of the 
bradley mcgee act which allocated 79 million for more 
childprotection workers 
a former florida health and rehabilitative services caseworker 
was convicted last month of felony child abuse for negligence for 
failing to provide a judge with a psychological evaluation of the 
coes describing them as infantile explosive and unable to handle 
children 
three other state workers were cleared of charges filed in their 
handling of the case

the coast guard estimated monday that 
500000 gallons of oil leaked into galveston bay from two barges 
10 times its original estimate of the weekend spill that has killed 
fish and stalled marine traffic 
we have upgraded the spill to a major spill said coast 
guard capt thomas greene 
a patchy sheen of oil was seen heading through the bolivar pass 
from the bay into the gulf of mexico threatening to make the 
cleanup more difficult coast guard petty officer gene maestas said 
monday night the bay is bordered by environmentally sensitive 
marshes and beaches 
a skimmer ship was dispatched to try to keep the oil from the 
gulf 
thick black patches of goop and a brown sheen have spread 
through much of the bay greene said he said suspicious oil was 
reported on at least two beaches south of where the barges and a 
tanker collided saturday 
the largest slick estimated at 8 miles long remained northeast 
of the collision site late monday near redfish island in the 
houston ship channel which took a pretty bad hit maestas 
said the coast guard didnt have an estimate of how much oil had 
washed up on the island 
the revised estimate came after crews finished removing oil from 
a listing barge monday and determined how much oil was left in a 
second barge partly submerged in the channel officials said 
coast guard officials estimated 48000 gallons of oil leaked 
from the listing barge meaning most of the oil leaked from the 
nearly sunken vessel the two barges contained a total of 168 
million gallons of catfeed oil a heavy refinery oil similar to 
no 5 fuel oil maestas said 
any spill over 100000 gallons is considered major greene said 
the coast guard originally estimated 50000 gallons had spilled 
the spill has killed an undetermined number of fish near redfish 
island and forced the closure of the channel 
by monday afternoon at least 58 ships were stalled at the 
houston docks or outside the galveston bay because the channel was 
closed mark layton manager of kerr marine steamship inc 
estimated the delays were costing ship owners up to 20000 per 
ship 
the coast guard hopes to reopen the channel by wednesday greene 
said 
the salvage contractor tampt marine of galveston used four skimmer 
vessels and a vacuum truck to suck up oil on monday greene said 
booms were used to surround leading edges of the spill to try to 
contain the heaviest sections 
almost every area surrounding the bay is considered 
environmentally sensitive said texas water commission chairman 
bj buck wynne 
while the amount of the spill is less than the mega borg i 
would say the potential for aquatic damage is more significant 
he said referring to last months spill of 39 million gallons 
from the norwegian supertanker some 57 miles offshore from 
galveston 
texas land commissioner garry mauro agreed and said a special 
session of the legislature may be necessary to enact oil spill 
readiness laws 
i think once again it shows that we in texas really arent 
prepared to deal with an oil spill he said this happened 
saturday and this is monday morning and were still talking about 
what equipment to put where and where we are going to get the 
equipment from 
wynne and mauro plan on tuesday to present coast guard officials 
with a plan to use oileating microbes on the spill the state 
tried the microbes on the mega borg spill and said theyd reduced 
the oil in the test area 
these tidal wetlands are very sensitive wynne said if oil 
gets in there it might be more difficult to clean up with 
conventional methods he said use of skimmers or other mechanical 
devices could endanger shallow marshlands and sensitive estuaries 
the tanker shinoussa was damaged in the collision with two of 
three barges under tow by the tanker chandy n but did not leak any 
of the 24900 metric tons of jet fuel it was carrying 
coast guard officials originally believed the tanker was of 
liberian registry but learned monday that the 610foot 
doublehulled vessel is a greek ship

we are taking steps to see that it doesnt happened again said

with intent to endanger life and conspiracy to cause explosions in 
britain between jan 1 1981 and oct 27 1983

fingerprints linked ellis to an irish republican army arms cache

laywers for ellis argued that the alleged offenses were 
political and an integral and necessary part of the campaign by 
the ira to end british rule in northern ireland

indiscriminate violence and can correctly be characterized as 
terrorism

george steinbrenner was stripped monday of 
direct control of the new york yankees all but ending a turbulent 
18year reign during which he alienated players and fans alike 
fans at yankee stadium for a game against the detroit tigers 
greeted the announcement with a 90second standing ovation 
baseball commissioner fay vincent forced steinbrenner to resign 
as principal partner of the team for paying a gambler to dig up 
dirt on dave winfield the american league teams onetime star 
outfielder 
steinbrenner agreed to vincents terms following a fourmonth 
investigation by the commissioner into steinbrenners dealing with 
selfdescribed gambler howard spira observers suggested that 
steinbrenner was seeking leverage to force winfield to accept a 
trade to another team something his contract gave him a right to 
refuse 
mr steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the 
management of the new york yankees or in the daytoday operations 
of that club vincent said 
steinbrenner the teams majority owner must resign as general 
partner by aug 20 when someone will be appointed to take his 
place subject to the approval of vincent and the other major 
league teams vincent asked steinbrenner to reduce his interest to 
below 50 percent within the next six months 
steinbrenner will however be allowed to consult on major 
business decisions involving the yankees but he must ask vincents 
permission to attend games 
for all purposes mr steinbrenner agrees that he is to be 
treated as if he had been placed on the permanent ineligible 
list vincent said 
steinbrenner also agreed he wouldnt contest the decision in 
court 
i will not comment on the decision steinbrenner said im 
very happy it was resolved im very satisfied with the resolution 
and thats all im going to say 
this was the second straight summer baseball penalized one of 
its more famous characters last august pete rose was banned for 
life for gambling 
as one baseballs more fiery characters steinbrenner was famous 
for his hiring and firing of managers particularly the late billy 
martin and for feuding with his players including reggie jackson 
and winfield 
winfield was one of steinbrenners many highpriced free agents 
but steinbrenner turned on the star outfielder after he went 
1for22 in the 1981 world series loss to los angeles later 
steinbrenner derided winfield as mr may saying he only came 
through when it didnt count 
winfield and steinbrenner feuded throughout the 1980s and after 
several years of trying winfield was finally traded to the 
california angels last may 
steinbrenner is the only owner to be severely penalized twice 
for major offenses he was suspended in 1974 by thencommissioner 
bowie kuhn for making illegal campaign contributions to richard 
nixon 
this time vincent disciplined steinbrenner for violating rule 
21 otherwise knows as the best interests of baseball clause 
i am able to evaluate a pattern of behavior that borders on 
the bizarre vincent said it is apparent to me that mr 
steinbrenner does not appreciate the gravity of his conduct 
the investigation centered on steinbrenners 40000 payment to 
spira a 31yearold new yorker who describes himself as a former 
gambler and a former employee of the david m winfield foundation

federal drug czar william j bennett on monday 
proposed taking children away from drugridden families and 
neighborhoods and putting them in foster homes and other 
institutions 
it may be radical but radical circumstances require radical 
means bennett said during a luncheon on the opening day of the 
national urban leagues 80th anniversary convention 
bennett told those attending the civil rights groups meeting 
that with the bigcity narcotics crisis likely to get worse before 
it gets better antidrug efforts must focus on the young 
the heart of any plan must be a plan to save our children 
said the director of the office of national drug control policy 
if we dont tend to these children soon no government or 
nongovernment program will fill the need 
bennett proposed that the courts be permitted to remove children 
from families were parents or guardians are addicted or too 
preoccupied with drugs to provide physical moral or spiritual 
guidance 
the courts would place the children in foster homes such 
institutions as boys towns or girls towns and school and 
churchsponsored centers bennett said 
he noted that courts can now take such steps for abused or 
negelected minors but said his proposal was likely to provoke 
controversy 
if this shocks some people into getting guardians to guarding 
and parents to parenting then fine bennett said 
he appealed to the urban league for support citing a statement 
by group president john e jacob that drugs are destroying more 
children and more families than poverty ever did 
bennett provided few specifics on his proposal he told a news 
conference following the luncheon that he wanted to see if we can 
get some agreement on the principle 
jacob said in a telephone interview that he found unnerving 
any proposal that would take children away from their parents and 
this one is no less unnerving 
but he said the childrens safety should be the uppermost 
concern the challenge is that if you dont like our plan come 
up with a better one to strengthen families and help children stay 
in families jacob said 
bennett said hed been criticized recently for remarking that 
orphanages might help solve the problem of children whose families 
had disintegrated from drugs 
some people thought that was too dickensian a phrase but the 
reality is a lot worse than anything charles dickens ever 
imagined bennett said

a federal judge ordered the justice department 
to index fbi documents on its investigation of jimmy hoffas 
disappearance 15 years ago monday a ruling the former teamsters 
leaders family hailed as a victory 
us district judge stephen limbaugh ordered the government to 
prepare within 30 days an itemized list off all documents related 
to a freedom of information request by the family 
the government must provide a detailed justification for any 
documents it wants exempted limbaugh ruled 
our family is extremely grateful fifteen years have gone by 
without them telling us what they know said attorney barbara 
crancer who sued the government for files on her fathers case in 
february 1989 
weve waited so long to hear something she said 
crancer said it was pretty ironic the ruling friday came 
just before the 15th anniversary of hoffas july 30 1975 
disappearance 
i dont think the judge planned it that way she said 
calls seeking comment from fbi spokesman john anthony and 
justice department attorney henry fredericks were not immediately 
returned 
hoffa 62 vanished from a restaurant parking lot in the detroit 
suburb of bloomfield township federal investigators have said they 
believe he was murdered but couldnt release their files because 
their probe was continuing 
hoffa built detroits local 299 a tiny teamsters unit into a 
15000member local and became president of the international 
union 
in 1958 he was hauled before the us senate rackets committee 
and accused of running a hoodlum empire 
nine years later hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and 
fraud involving the teamsters central pension fund and received a 
fiveyear federal prison term under a sentence commutation he 
received from president nixon in 1971 hoffa was barred from 
returning to office in the teamsters until 1980 
when hoffa vanished he was contesting that provision in court 
his son detroit attorney jimmy p hoffa has said he thinks his 
father was killed because he was trying to return to union power

an attorney representing a gop lobbyist 
involved in a controversial savings and loan bailout asked the 
senate ethics committee to decide whether sen howard m metzenbaum 
or his aides improperly shared confidential investigative material 
with the new york times 
the inquiry was requested july 23 by stanley m brand a lawyer 
representing lobbyist robert j thompson who was an aide to george 
bush when he was vice president 
metzenbaum an ohio democrat is chairman of the senate 
judiciary subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business 
rights which is looking into thompsons involvement in negotiating 
the bailout of 15 thrift institutions now combined as bluebonnet 
savings bank of dallas 
the times ran a frontpage story by reporter jeff gerth on 
questions surrounding the bluebonnet deal july 8 the day before 
metzenbaums subcommittee held a hearing on the case 
it now appears indisputable that sensitive investigative 
information gathered in the name of the us senate was 
deliberately intentionally and inappropriately given to a major 
national newspaper brand wrote 
brand based his complaint in part on a statement from cable 
news network reporter brooks jackson who said he was told by 
metzenbaums staff that they had made an exclusive arrangement to 
share information with gerth in exchange for an agreement that the 
times would hold the story until the day before the hearing 
jackson who was quoted in the july 21 editions of the 
washington post said he was quoted accurately but declined to 
reveal which metzenbaum aide had told him about the arrangement 
with the times 
gerth referred inquiries to howell raines the newspapers 
washington bureau chief who said as a matter of policy we 
dont discuss sources or the editorial process he said the story 
was meticulously researched from a number of sources and was 
industriously and honorably reported 
nancy coffey metzenbaums press secretary said brands 
complaint was too ridiculous to comment on 
wilson abney staff director of the ethics committee said he 
could not discuss what action the panel was taking on the complaint 
or even whether it had been received he said complaints typically 
are referred to staff attorneys who can then recommend whether or 
not the complaint should be investigated

the daily news blasted gov mario cuomo in an 
editorial july 29 for creating a completely unjustified board 
of inquiry to examine labor negotiations at the newspaper 
the news feels free to call the governors action a 
cynical political move by a potential presidential candidate to 
curry favor with national labor leaders the editorial said 
the news and its 10 unions have been negotiating for months 
without success to replace contracts that expired march 30 
state labor commissioner thomas hartnett announced july 26 he 
was appointing a factfinding panel to provide a fresh look at 
the issues and help prevent the dispute from harming the regional 
economy 
the panel has no legal authority to compel actions by either 
side although it has broad power to subpoena witnesses and gather 
evidence 
the editorial called the panel a completely unjustified 
intrusion into the collective bargaining process and a violation of 
federal labor law 
it also ripped the board as a publicity stunt that could have 
a ruinous impact on the states business climate 
cuomo called the editorial a ploy by a management that is 
desperately seeking to avoid an objective look at the issues he 
said the state has the legal right and the practical obligation 
to help achieve fairness by disclosing the truth

municipal officials too often slam the door on 
companies that could provide headtohead competition for cable tv 
operators a federal regulator said july 27 
federal communications commission chairman alfred sikes rejected 
the notion that like utility monopolies communities are best 
served by exclusive cable tv franchises he said competition will 
drive down both costs and prices 
a new fcc study shows that cable operators face headtohead 
competition in only a handful of communities resulting in high 
prices and poor service sikes told a news conference 
headtohead competition places an exceptionally high premium 
on cutting costs and putting the customer first sikes said 
competitive markets and competitive markets alone will in the 
final analysis force prices toward true costs 
rather than reregulate cable prices which congress is preparing 
to do sikes said laws are needed to ease the way for 
multiplecable franchises and more competition from technologies 
such as satellite broadcasters and microwave cable systems 
on july 26 the commission voted to forward a report to congress 
urging legislation that limits municipal authority to erect 
barriers or sustain entry barriers and which prohibits an 
unreasonable refusal to grant a second cable franchise

as new hampshires attorney general in 1976 
supreme court nominee david souter submitted a brief in which the 
state argued against paying for medicaid abortions and referred to 
abortion as the killing of unborn children 
in an earlier case argued in 1972 when souter was the states 
deputy attorney general new hampshire defended its strict 
antiabortion law against a constitutional challenge by arguing 
the maintenance of an unborn childs right to birth is a 
compelling interest which outweighs any rights of a mother to an 
abortion except when necessary to preserve her life 
in both cases the extent of souters personal involvement is 
unclear and from neither one argued before and one after the 
us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
is it possible to determine his personal views on abortion an 
issue likely to play a major role in his september confirmation 
hearings 
new hampshires attorney general is appointed by the governor 
and by law represents him and other state officials in court cases 
the states governor when both abortion cases were argued was 
meldrim thompson a conservative abortion foe

five colleges are hatching plans to help revamp 
neighboring public schools this fall and each say they are 
drawing lessons from boston universitys unprecedented management 
takeover of a nearby district 
no one is rushing to imitate boston universitys yearold 
ambitious effort to manage and radically transform the entire 
school district of chelsea mass a nearly broke system of 3500 
students with some of the worst test scores in that state 
but the universitys 10year plan to manage chelseas daytoday 
operations and raise tens of millions of dollars to finance reforms 
is apparently earning national credence as colleges seek ways to 
nurture school reform 
i think the very positive impact of the bostonchelsea 
relationship has been to encourage colleges to become more involved 
than they have been but i dont think the model of taking a system 
over will be the way it goes said robert atwell president of 
the american council on education in washington

sixty american volunteers have come to this 
city of copernicus to teach poles the english language they crave 
elsewhere in eastern europe too the english language is 
spreading rapidly as soviet power and obligatory russianlanguage 
classes disappear 
despite efforts by france and germany to promote the use of 
their languages in the region english appears well in the lead as 
the second tongue of choice 
enrollment in english classes is up sharply in poland hungary 
and czechoslovakia 
besides asking englishspeaking countries to send teachers 
europes new democracies are running crash training programs at 
home and broadcasting british and american radio and television 
programs in the original language 
the thirst for english has contributed to explosive growth in 
private language schools and is spilling over to the world of 
commerce 
at the education ministry lucyna tarasiewicz looked puzzled 
when a reporter asked why the ministry emphasized the teaching of 
english over for instance german or russian 
isnt your question somewhat rhetorical she asked 
without a doubt the majority of young people in our schools want 
to learn this language especially recently most contacts on this 
continent are held in english 
grazyna siedleckaorzel a veteran educator helping to train 
english teachers said for so many years english was 
suppressed now nobody wants to learn russian because english is 
the language of the world 
although study of russian was required in the communist years 
and classes in other languages were scarce few students learned 
russian well because the motivation was extremely low mrs 
tarasiewicz said 
now that russian is treated as just another language parents 
and students are flocking to english as the ticket to a better 
future german and french are a distant second 
barbara kurianiuk who has taught for six years at bialystok in 
northeast poland is certified in russiam but recently became her 
high schools only teacher of english she has six classes of 30 
students each 
how many of the 500 or so students want into those classes 
i think everyone she said 
ms kurianiuk said the problems were enormous the school has no 
english textbooks and even newspapers and magazines are hard to 
come by 
peace corps volunteers are taking cram courses in survival 
polish at toruns university before fanning out to cities 
throughout the country most will teach high school students but 
the more experienced will train other teachers 
in a foretaste of what is in store more than 1700 poles 
applied for 300 places in practices classes where the volunteers 
will rehearse teaching techniques 
it is going to be a lot of work for us but thats why were 
here said teacher mike kennedy of meriden conn 
william lovelace head of the peace corps in poland said 
english instruction topped the countrys list when the united 
states offered last year to send its first volunteers to eastern 
europe 
sixty peace corps teachers each arrived in poland and hungary in 
june and 22 are due in czechoslovakia this fall for a total of 
142 and the same number will be added next year lovelace said 
the british voluntary service organization harvards world 
teach and the canadian government are offering trainers in english 
and france and west germany are sending teachers of their languages 
english is becoming ubiquitous in eastern europe polish 
television broadcasts cnn headline news each morning and warsaws 
radio solidarity carries the bbc world news 
in hungary the new station radio bridge beams allenglish 
programming largely supplied by the voice of americas europe 
network 
czechoslovak televisions third channel which used to carry 
soviet programs has become a potpourri of western fare with 
englishlanguage programs leading the way 
some grasp of english even appears necessary for eastern 
europeans to follow the dramatic economic changes being charted for 
them 
vaclav klaus the czechoslovak finance minister peppers 
television speeches with terms like standby loans and 
options nearly everyone in poland understands the term joint 
ventures by now 
on the streets english names add a certain cachet warsaw 
fastfood stands advertise hot dogs but usually offer only an 
approximation of pizza or rolls stuffed with stewed mushrooms 
in budapest one can visit the top shop or mix shop even the 
boutique shop and sip something refreshing at the drink bar 
english is a common second language in europe so when a pole or 
czech talks business with an italian or greek it often is the 
language used 
mrs tarasiewicz of the education ministry estimated poland will 
need 20000 teachers of western languages including 1200015000 
for english to meet the minimal requirements of students in grades 
7 through 12 
she said the ministry eventually would like to extend language 
training to elementary schools which would require 10000 more 
teachers 
polish schools have only 1200 english teachers compared with 
20000 teachers of russian most of whom have little to do these 
days the proportions are similar in hungary and czechoslovakia 
few englishlanguage majors teach in the public schools because 
they can earn three times the national average salary by giving 
private lessons or using their language skills in business mrs 
tarasiewicz said 
a special program to retrain russian teachers may provide 2000 
more teachers of english in three years she said but the 
desirable staffing level may not be reached for 15 years 
with such a dearth of instructors there is little concern about 
whether the english being taught is american or british mrs 
tarasiewicz said 
lovelace of the peace corps said they would settle for 
australian or sri lankan english if they could get it or west 
indian you could have poles with jamaican accents walking around 
he added that american english seemed to be leading the british 
version 
if you listen to the radio here what are they playing he 
said us country music and r amp b songs ive heard more little 
richard here than ive heard in years the radio is telling us 
something 
entrepreneurs have benefited from the passion to learn english 
the number of applicants is three to four times greater than 
what we can admit said laszlo simonflavy manager of the 
international language school of budapest there is a boom in 
demand for english and it is yet to level off 
most students are aged 16 to 25 and prefer american english he 
said 
simonflavy charges 1 for attendance at a 45minute class 
private tutors can earn up to 10 an hour in a country where the 
average monthly wage is equal to about 130

the french are finally throwing in the 
serviette or towel in the global battle for linguistic 
supremacy 
french officials and teachers say english is unquestionably the 
no 1 international tongue and theres little point in going 
teteatete with it any longer 
the germans agree if a battle lies ahead it may be between 
french and german for second place 
we cant make a linguistic maginot line said bernard 
cerquiglini a leading french authority on language thats what 
weve been trying to do especially against english its a lost 
battle 
cerquiglini who is fluent in english heads the general 
delegation of the french language assigned by prime minister michel 
rocard to promote the study of french abroad 
he and his colleagues hope to make french the most popular 
language throuhout europe after english 
our strategy is to promote all european languages to make 
europe multilingual cerquiglini said the riches of europe are 
in its languages if europe becomes unilingual the language will 
be english obviously 
that view marks a strategic retreat in the long effort to 
restore french to international leadership 
in the 17th and 18th centuries french was unchallenged as the 
language of diplomacy and the conversation of educated people 
the industrial revolution led by britain made english the 
language of international commerce by the time queen victorias 
empire had spread english around the world an oxbridge accent had 
as much cachet as aristocratic french 
diplomacy remained a francophone stronghold through the early 
part of this century the versailles treaty after world war i was 
written in french and understood in that language by president 
woodrow wilson 
after world war ii the global role of the united states built 
an unrivaled position for english frances efforts to hold the 
line have included aid to frenchspeaking countries francophone 
song festivals and even futile attempts to weed out franglais 
english words used in common speech 
promoters of french see opportunity in eastern europe nations 
with historic links to france are the prime targets paticularly 
romania poland and czechoslovakia 
rocards cabinet said recently that promotion of french in 
eastern europe should be a major component of foreign policy 
french television viewers were buoyed by seeing residents of 
bucharest speaking perfect french to reporters during the december 
revolution in romania french and romanian are based on latin and 
french is the only western language many romanians know 
weve had great luck so far said catherine michaud of the 
hachette foundation which sent 100000 frenchlanguage books to 
romanian libraries there are plenty of people who already know 
french and want to keep learning it 
the worlds bestknown french school the alliance francaise 
plans to add branches this year in the soviet union bulgaria 
czechoslovakia and hungary it already has schools in romania 
poland hungary and yugoslavia 
french television is beamed to poland and czechoslovakia and 
bilingual radio stations are starting up 
i think that a cultivated man in the europe of tomorrow will 
need at least two languages besides his own said francois 
hingue director of foreign services for alliance francaise 
one will be english the other probably french or maybe 
german in brussels with the eec or geneva in banking french is 
definitely going to be an advantage 
a unified economically strong germany may seem in a better 
position to establish its language in eastern europe 
susanne hoehn of the goethe institute in munich an organization 
similar to the alliance francaise said it is opening branches in 
moscow prague and warsaw she said the changes in eastern europe 
had produced an extremely strong increase in interest for 
german 
according to the goethe institutes figures she said 95 
million people are studying german in the region and they need 
textbooks teachers all kinds of teaching aides 
germans in general seem less concerned with promoting their 
language 
it once was the lingua franca of science but now theres a 
tendency in medicine in the sciences and engineering to publish 
very much in english said werner bies an english specialist at 
the free university in west berlin 
he said the french try much harder to promote their own 
language 
the general delegation of the french language plans to sponsor 
teacher exchanges with a unified germany to encourage better french 
instruction in the eastern sector 
german school officials believe english will continue to be the 
foreign language of choice even among former east germans who were 
required to learn russian 
cerquiglini believes the reason is partly psychological 
for people whove been forced to learn russian for a long 
time to learn western languages like english and french is like 
already having a bit of liberty he said

the british take obvious pride in the spread of 
english across the globe but fret that the language of 
shakespeare milton and barbara cartland has been hijacked by 
americans 
its not just a cultural issue but one of marketing the product 
that is teaching the language to other nations 
we intend to replace russian with english as the second 
language throughout eastern europe foreign secretary douglas 
hurd said in may 
teaching english or teaching english teachers is a major 
concern of the british government knowhow funds established 
for eastern europe 
ah but whose english will the europeans learn the independent 
newspaper editorialized recently that british publishers should 
point out that they offer the superior and european version of 
the tongue 
what selfrespecting lithuanian or ukrainian czech or pole 
wants to speak english like one of mr gorbachevs interpreters 
with a twang picked up from the other superpower the newspaper 
inquired 
in a froth of linguistic jingoism reporter gerard evans wrote 
in the newspaper today that britain faced being blown out of 
the booming englishlanguage market in eastern europe 
all over romania bulgaria and the like sidewalks are full of 
rambunctious kids slupping sic pepsi sucking face with their 
chicks and dreaming of gekkoing into the world of business and big 
simoleons when it comes to studying proper english grammar and 
syntax theyll take a raincheck thank you 
julian amey executive director of bbc english feels it isnt 
helpful to draw broad contrasts between british english and 
american english 
its a worldwide language and the variants are not that 
vital he said in an interview amey described english 
instruction as a huge and growing market with ample opportunities 
for all agencies british and american that can provide 
services 
a report in 1989 by the economist intelligence unit estimated 
the market value of the language at 6 billion pounds nearly 11 
billion a year it said britain controlled about onesixth of the 
market mainly through courses and textbooks and the uscanadian 
share was twice that 
the bbc teaches english by radio television and print its 
englishteaching cartoon character muzzy in gondoland appears 
on soviet television and in france italy spain and mexico amey 
said 
moscow radios mediumwave service carries bbc radio classes he 
said and the bimonthly magazine bbc english just signed up 700 
subscribers in czechoslovakia 
tom mcarthur editor of the learned journal english today said 
the competition of british and american english was a contest 
between a 19th century empire and a 20th century superpower 
between the bbc world service and hollywood 
britains old guard resents it he said in an interview 
they find it a little difficult to accept the enormous 
pressures on british english from american english mcarthur 
said there is much more traveling from you to us than from us to 
you 
american english may be slightly easier to learn he said 
because it uses spelling pronunciation for instance an 
american has a secretary while a briton has a secretry 
japanese on the other hand might find british english more 
attractive because it doesnt pronounce the troublesome r mcarthur 
said 
which english will be spoken in bucharest and warsaw 20 years 
from now i would expect to hear both he said because the 
influence of the bbc and british publishers is so great

they are devout intense orthodox in their 
russian religion and unorthodox in their politics men from moscow 
who contend that the only way to reform the soviet union is to 
dissolve it 
they are telling americans in and out of government that while 
their nation needs aid massive aid it should not be channeled 
through mikhail s gorbachev a man whose time they say has gone 
instead they want the west to work with individual republics 
like russia with local governments and with independent 
cooperatives businesses and organizations like their christian 
democratic party 
sipping ice water in a conference room at the conservative think 
tank that is sponsoring their weeklong us visit they take turns 
telling through an interpreter of plans and goals that seem far 
beyond their reach 
gleb yakunin a russian orthodox priest victor aksyuchits the 
party chairman and valery borshchov a member of the moscow city 
council use differing words to preach the same political sermon 
us policy should not be tied to gorbachevs government 
yakunins black cassock and silver cross do not fit the image of 
a political figure but his words do and he seems to be first 
among this political threesome all threatened as dissidents and 
yakunin imprisoned before the reforms for which they credit 
gorbachev 
gorbachev has done great historic service by starting this 
process yakunin said but now events have gone beyond 
him 
so we need new forces now to carry through the reform said 
aksyuchits the communist party is not capable of doing it 
the aims and agenda these three men outline sounds impractical 
unrealistic far beyond reach 
but it bears mention that only eight months ago vytautas 
landsbergis a quiet music teacher and parliamentarian came to 
washington to tell the few who would listen that lithuanians meant 
to declare their independence of the soviet union and wanted the 
united states to help make it stick 
he got to see an assistant secretary of state then he went home 
and became president of a breakaway lithuania 
yakunin aksyuchits and borshchov are making the rounds at the 
state department the capitol and today with an appointment to 
see white house chief of staff john h sununu 
they wont gain encouragement for their suggestion that the 
united states and the west work around gorbachev instead of through 
his government although the administration has said it is seeking 
contacts with some of the opposition political and economic 
movements in the soviet union 
diplomacy and economic business are conducted on a 
governmenttogovernment basis and that means us officials deal 
with gorbachev 
the administration wants his policies to succeed while 
president bush has rejected direct us economic aid west germany 
is offering assistance beginning with 31 billion in guaranteed 
bank loans and other european allies may help too the united 
states has not ruled out technical assistance and advice 
the opposition politicians agree that aid is needed but want it 
routed to political and economic organizations they say can make up 
a new civil society to take over from communism 
the west shouldnt place all its bets on gorbachev said 
aksyuchits that would be a mistake 
its necessary to deal not with yesterdays structures but 
with tomorrows structures yakunin said the soviet empire is 
the last great empire and the time has come for this great empire 
to leave the stage of history 
he said it will be replaced by a looser but lasting political 
union among soviet republics 
the three russians came to new york and washington under the 
sponsorship of the free congress foundation a conservative 
political organization that has been conducting training missions 
on democratic process for opposition parties and their leaders in 
the soviet union and in eastern europe 
their russian christian democratic movement was founded in 1987 
when opposition political parties were legalized earlier this year 
it became one their platform is a densely worded blend of religion 
and politics they claim broad popular support in russia 
yakunin couldnt guess how many opposition parties have been 
created in the soviet union this year nobody really knows he 
said dozens and dozens like soap bubbles some disappear 
he said a handful will be the forces of democracy in the future 
and the christian democrats will be one of them 
those claims of party strength are subject to proof the power 
of the independent political movements already is on display

last august deborah norville anchored bad 
girls about violent teenaged girls it was the sort of 
documentary that used to sprout only in geraldo rivera country 
sure it got high ratings 
tonight she anchors another nbc news summer special bearing the 
snappy title sex buys and advertising 
cowabunga you say give me a break 
oddly enough the show isnt all bad even though its not 
exactly hardhitting its even good in some parts including its 
segments on product plugs in movies advertising that is steadily 
creeping into classrooms and the use of star athletes to tout 
highcost sneakers that some ghetto kids literally kill for 
but those who expect a tabloid approach because of the sex 
in the shows title can properly accuse nbc of deceptive 
showtitling 
the only real sex stuff is an early segment on how the estee 
lauder cosmetics giant is planning its coming megabucks campaign 
which includes 6 million to model paulina porizkova to be its one 
and only mannequin 
says paulina advertising is a little bit of a dream 
students of the salacious will not give this part the wowee 
award 
norville who has noisily suffered the slings and arrows of 
outrageous critics ever since jane pauley made way for her on 
today starts things with a quick look at memorable commercials 
of yesteryear 
then in what proves a frequent ability to toss off a cliche 
she informs viewers that if you feel youve been bombarded with 
more ads than ever before youre right 
moments later you will hear her say advertisers say its 
getting harder and harder to reach the consumer because were 
surrounded by so many ads the average american is bombarded by 
1000 television commercials a week 
unfortunately neither she norville nor her cowriter rhonda 
schwartz the shows producer inquire about what may be the real 
issue whether so many ads result in viewers now recalling only one 
long brightcolored blur 
the show is broad in scope but too broad its segment on the 
commercial bombardment of children could have been made a special 
of itself 
or if nbc wanted well ratings norville could have devoted an 
hour to celebrity advertising pitches here and abroad brief 
samples show povertystricken actors eddie murphy and arnold 
schwarzenegger trying to earn a yen in japanese commercials 
the shows basic worth is as a onceoverlightly primer on 
modern advertising including target advertising at blacks and 
hispanics teens and preteens and what critics of all this have 
to say 
but there are times the show could have used a sense of silly 
as when 
a cocreator of the celebrated ad for infiniti tries to 
explain why the ad didnt include the car in the commercial 
a major ad agency doing research on teens who buy dispatches 
an anthropologist to secretly observe teenage behavior on 
fastfood restaurants 
new yorks hottest hippest ad agency tries to land the 
carvel ice cream account the agencys young cofounders who seem 
straight out of thirtysomething lose you feel for them how 
sad it is to be hot and hip and still lose the carvel ice cream 
account 
there also is a world of funny material also lurking in the 
segment on productplugging for a fee in movies the citations 
include the pepsi requested by michael j fox in back to the 
future 
norville asks fox who earlier is seen making a pepsi 
commercial and earning a reported 1 million for same if 
productpluggings in films compromise the art of filmmaking

editors note he was americas most controversial architect a 
flamboyant innovator now three decades after his death frank 
lloyd wright is appreciated far more than at any time in his long 
career but scores of the buildings that reflect his distinctive 
style have vanished and his fans are taking steps to save those 
that remain 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
now that he has been placed on equal 
footing with the greek firm of ictinus and callicrates that 
designed the parthenon a serious effort is under way to save frank 
lloyd wrights surviving buildings from being knocked down 
its sinful sinful exclaims jeanette fields looking out 
the window of her wrightdesigned house in nearby river forest 
ill watching a group of japanese tourists who are looking in 
tokyos imperial hotel is gone the larkin building in buffalo 
was torn down for no sane reason chicagos midway gardens went to 
the wreckers ball and look what theyre doing to the guggenheim 
museum in new york 
the tourists she says come by the busload beginning as soon 
as the sun comes up they are frank lloyd wright fans armed with 
cameras maps and cassette recorders hot on the trail of 33 houses 
and 10 bootlegs moonlighting jobs while working as a 
draftsman for architect louis sullivan that wright built between 
1889 in 1909 in oak park and adjoining river forest 10 miles west 
of chicago 
built in 190l hers is one of the earliest of wrights prairie 
school houses which still draw admirers from around the world 
mrs fields who admits to being kicked out of several dinner 
parties for getting very emotional about people selling off wright 
windows and woodwork is a director of the recently formed frank 
lloyd wright building conservancy 
the conservancy is a consortium of wright homeowners curators 
of wright house museums architects and preservationists it is 
the latest manifestation of growing public concern about preserving 
the surviving 347 buildings designed by wright in a career that 
spanned seven decades 
sixtyseven buildings already have vanished and many others are 
seriously deteriorating they are under threat from urban sprawl 
and developers or prey to scavengers in the booming market for 
wright artifacts such as art glass windows and decorative woodwork 
preserving whats left is no easy task concedes oak park 
architect john thorpe who has had a hand in restoring 21 frank 
lloyd wright houses 
if the building is in really decrepit condition youre going 
to pay a lot more for restoration than you did for the property 
he says thats why cannibalism is so lethal to our efforts the 
temptation is to sell off one or two windows which can bring 
250000 or so on the art market to pay off the restoration 
fortunately the people who buy and live in these houses today 
are not unlike the special brand of thinking clients who were the 
original owners and had faith in wrights offbeat ideas they know 
whats different about these houses the natural light the feeling 
of shelter the openness the sheer comfort 
restoration takes tact its like telling a neighbor to fix up 
his garage says preservationist frank pond who is active in 
saving unity temple the unitarian church in oak park that was 
wrights first public building 
the church he says was built for 40000 our restoration 
surveys cost more 
wright who died 31 years ago at age 91 is far more appreciated 
and revered now than at any time in a flamboyant career the 
architect who never lacked selfesteem was scorned for his 
leaving a wife and six kids to run off with a clients wife then 
there was the gory murder of his mistress two of her children and 
four workmen by a crazed employee 
he was endlessly ducking bill collectors soothing clients over 
leaky roofs and cost overruns that sometimes ran into the millions 
honest arrogance was wrights justification for treating 
clients critics and creditors like unruly children but the dapper 
charmer in the porkpie hat flowing tie and opera cape probably 
never envisioned that 70000 tourists a year would troop through 
the home and studio in oak park which he started with a 5000 
loan and which has just undergone a 12year 21 million 
restoration 
he must be up there chuckling says jeanette fields who 
concedes that her restoration costs were many many times over 
the price paid by the original owner e arthur davenport who 
worked for the illinois central railroad 
the vault of heaven may also echo with chuckles at the recent 
sale of a wright dining room table and chairs for 16 million and 
christies auctioning off one of his floor lamps for 704000 and 
another lamp together with an oak music cabinet for 330000 
no fewer than 12 wright houses are now museums including 
fabulous fallingwater perched over that waterfall in bear run 
pa the mayermay house in grand rapids mich refurbished to its 
original glory in a twoyear multimilliondollar restoration and 
the danathomas house in springfield ill undergoing a 46 
million restoration funded by the illinois legislature 
in japan where wright has had a fanatical following since his 
first visit in 1903 an outdoor museum near nagoya has reproduced 
in authentic scale the facade of his earthquakeproof imperial 
hotel this daring classic which he floated on pilings sunk in 
the soft mud bottom and delicately balanced like a tray on the 
fingertips of a waiter survived the great tokyo earthquake and 
fire of 1923 but fell to the wreckers ball in 1967 
an agreement has just been reached to reproduce and market 
wrights furniture which 20 years ago according to chicago 
preservationist timothy barton you couldnt get the salvation 
army to cart away 
his original drawings are valued in the tens of millions of 
dollars

and what other architect three decades after his death goes on 
pleasing clients with his office tragedies buildings that for 
lack of funds or other reasons never got built in his lifetime in 
recent years some 15 wright designs have been executed in half a 
dozen states 
we frequently get inquiries about his blueprints says 
architect charles montooth who recently erected wrightdesigned 
houses in ann arbor and santa fe interest in mr wright goes in 
waves and each time the peak gets a little higher 
until recently people didnt realize he designed fabrics and 
furniture now galleries and collectors are bidding up his 
artifacts like impressionist paintings 
montooth is a fellow at the frank lloyd wright school of 
architecture and a member of taliesin associated architects the 
firm that continues his ideas and principles 
architects still operate out of wrights two former 
headquarters taliesin north in spring green wis and taliesin 
west near phoenix ariz 
there are problems building from old plans says montooth 
leading a guest on a tour of taliesin norths sandstone and native 
oak buildings that seemed to grow out a hillside building codes 
and client requirements change over the years costs go up a house 
that could be built for 20000 in the 30s might run you a 
quartermillion now 
and mr wright kept changing his ideas as he went along he 
was like thomas jefferson at monticello from day to day he never 
saw a project the same way 
montooth recalls the early days at taliesin west in arizona 
it was just a glorified tent but mr wright in his 70s then had 
to have his grand piano he loved grand pianos and fast cars mr 
wright believed apprentices should learn by building so we lived 
in tents while we built in the desert 
yamesee plantation near charleston sc which was in 
deplorable decay is undergoing a multimilliondollar restoration 
in addition outer buildings that wright designed and never saw 
built are in the overall plan 
the proprietor is movie producer joel silver who already lives 
in a wright house in hollywood storer house a pompeiian villa 
remarkable for having no front door wright liked his entrances 
secluded mysterious evoking our primitive ancestors finding 
shelter in a cave 
but in other areas preservation of the legacy is far from 
encouraging reports carla lind executive director of the 
conservancy she and others lament new additions to the marin 
county civic center north of san francisco and the guggenheim 
museum in new york 
under court pressure to relieve overcrowding marin county has 
planned a new jail that wright preservationists say would obstruct 
the view and destroy the groundhugging grandeur of his 
quartermilelong pink stucco center that leaps over roads and 
three small hills in graceful arches admirers compare it with pont 
du gard the roman aqueduct in provence 
erecting the jail protested preserve our civic center an 
advocacy group would be like putting a taco bell in front of the 
taj mahal 
similar anguished cries resulted in some modification of plans 
to expand the guggenheim wrights swirling concrete cone in new 
york city which has been hailed as his east coast masterpiece 
wright fans are still unreconciled by the revised plans 
they scrapped the first proposal which was an absolute 
monstrosity and came up with a second which is less monstrous 
said roland reisley secretary of the conservancy but from our 
viewpoint it is a serious loss to the integrity of one of the 
worlds most glorious spaces 
throughout his career wright never lost interest in lowincome 
housing 
chicago has given landmark protection to the partly burnedout 
and deteriorating waller apartments which rented for 12 a month 
at the turn of the century and to the abused and neglected 1894 
roloson buildings his only row houses 
both would cost more to restore than replace but they cry out 
for some philanthrophic endowment to save them says timothy 
barton a preservation specialist with the chicago landmark 
commission some of the windows surfaced as recently as two 
months ago on the art market and are worth more than the property 
the encouraging news for wright fans is that a number of museums 
now refuse to acquire fixtures and furniture scavenged from his 
surviving buildings 
conservancy director lind has not given up hope of rescuing the 
sadly decaying adgerman warehouse an impressive mayanstyle 
temple in richland center wis that wright created in 1916 for 
one of his many creditors certainly the worlds most bizarre 
warehouse it had room to store coal grain and feed supplies as 
well as retail shops an art gallery and a restaurant 
richland center is wrights birthplace and it would make an 
appropriate town hall she says

editors note whats a black liberal congressman from 
pennsylvania doing campaigning for a white conservative in the 
mississippi delta trying to win votes for democrats thats what 
a reporter recently followed house majority whip william h gray 
iii sometimes called the stealth whip by his colleagues on a 
foray into the deep south 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
freshman rep mike parker introduces house 
majority whip william h gray iii to his mississippi delta district 
with an analogy between the ways of washington and life in the wild 
to survive the gazelle must outrun the swiftest lion and gray 
he says is the slickest and fastest gazelle in washington dc 
as holder of the no 3 leadership spot in the house gray surely 
is at the front of the pack after little more than a decade in 
congress the pennsylvania democrat is in line to become the first 
black speaker of the house and part of a small group of blacks 
mentioned as possible candidates on a future democratic national 
ticket 
he reached that stratum because political opposites such as 
parker a conservative white democrat have come to view him as an 
ally rather than an enemy 
gray visiting jackson on a recent warm moist day to campaign 
for parker is the first outside democratic leader that parker has 
brought to his district he is expected to help with what political 
analysts call crossover support 
parker won his seat in 1988 refusing to endorse democratic 
nominee michael dukakis never mind jesse jackson the winner of 
mississippis democratic primary but his delta district is 37 
percent black and he like many southern democrats must hold the 
black vote 
but to say parker wanted gray to visit just because of race is 
wrong 
gray confirms the connection with power in the house which 
mississippi likes says ed cole parkers top aide and the 
mississippi democratic party chairman 
parker cites his personal rapport with gray as the main reason 
for the invitation especially the northern liberals 
understanding that the country is different 
bill gray exemplifies the type of leadership and substance 
that attracts democratic voters says hiram eastland a lawyer 
and cousin of the late sen james o eastland dmiss gray has 
appeal that crosses racial and party lines he says 
gray 48 came to congress in 1979 and as chairman of the 
freshman class quickly learned about the breadth of viewpoints he 
cut his teeth on forming coalitions when he won the chairmanship of 
the house budget committee in 1984 
as budget chairman for four years then chairman of the house 
democratic caucus chairman of the 1988 democratic party platform 
committee and for the past year majority whip gray has found 
consensus where critics said it couldnt exist 
he also has found admirers in odd places 
gray is not a standard ideological politician says rep 
newt gingrich rga the house minority whip who is grays 
opposite number on the house floor and in philosophy we both 
have a sense of mutual understanding which might surprise people 
it wouldnt surprise them much though 
campaigning with parker gray knows how to enhance his own power 
without flaunting it how to nurture friendships by avoiding 
potential arguments 
his job this day is to boost parker and mississippi democrats 
not himself 
mike is already making his presence felt he tells preachers 
gathered to hear him at the piney woods country life school an 
academy for black children outside jackson 
the bespectacled balding gray who still fulfills his sunday 
duties as minister at the bright hope baptist church in 
pennsylvania delivers polished rhetoric the clergymen take notes 
no doubt stealing a few lines for their sunday sermons and give 
their northern colleague an ovation 
before leaving the school gray gives students an impromptu pep 
talk on personal success and the scourge of drugs then he and 
parker zip downtown for a luncheon at a local restaurant with state 
democratic officials 
gray is a reconciliator he understands it takes 51 percent 
of the votes to win elections secretary of state dick molpus 
tells the group the audience includes rep mike espy dmiss a 
gray protege who is the only black in the states congressional 
delegation 
gray delivers a message of party pride and unity its easy 
for the other team to get together because they all look alike 
walk alike are crazy alike he says we come in all colors 
it was about his only mention of race all day he talks more of 
mississippi its powerful democratic house delegation and his own 
roots in the south gray was born in baton rouge la

mike wheres the catfish he jokingly complains to parker 
at event after event where they served trendy banquet food that 
could have been shipped from washington 
during an afternoon break he exchanges his suit and tie for 
shorts and a tshirt and plays tennis with parker and rep gv 
sonny montgomery dmiss another conservative friend 
then its back into his congressional uniform for more 
fundraising and mingling 
state rep bill wheeler who is white said having an 
inclusive leader like gray come to mississippi was important 
the conflict between black and white is one of the major 
reasons the state is last in national rankings for education and 
wealth he says 
back in washington gray doesnt give his votes to the 
conservatives he represents his district with a record that 
consistently gets a zero in the american conservative union 
ratings 
what gray does give to conservative and liberal democrats alike 
especially those in tough races is money 
he has a political action committee the committee for 
democratic opportunity which donated more than 72000 to other 
house members and aspirants this election cycle the list includes 
parker and gene taylor dmiss a new house member so conservative 
hes frequently rumored to be switching parties 
gray also has contributed money from his personal campaign 
treasury to candidates and the democratic congressional campaign 
committee which helps all the partys house candidates 
a soughtafter speechmaker at business and interestgroup 
gatherings gray collected 164098 in honorariums last year among 
congress highest 
while appealing to a wide audience gray carefully maintains his 
high profile in the black community he has been a prime sponsor of 
legislation to send food aid to ethiopia and impose economic 
sanctions on apartheid south africa 
other black lawmakers are quick to recognize grays achievements 
hes a jackie robinson in the congress of the united states 
says rep ron dellums dcalif chairman of the congressional 
black caucus referring to the great athlete who broke through the 
color barrier in major league baseball 
sometimes the political juggling act is delicate 
gray appeared on behalf of rep gus savage dill earlier this 
year and after he left savage told the gathering that jews were 
financing his primary election opponent many observers considered 
savages comments antisemitic 
despite pressure from jewish groups gray refused to comment on 
the incident for days until he could watch a videotape of savages 
speech then he condemned the remarks in a carefully worded 
statement that mended fences without vilifying savage 
for all his moderation gray has shown that when directly 
attacked he can strike back with viperlike quickness 
last year when he was running for whip a justice department 
official confirmed a leak that the fbi was investigating 
financial irregularities in grays congressional office 
gray immediately denied he was under investigation and blasted 
the department which is led by attorney general and former 
pennsylvania political foe dick thornburgh gray reacted so 
fiercely that the leak became as big a story as the investigation 
itself 
he forced the justice department to take the unusual step of 
issuing a statement that gray was not a target of the investigation 
and was cooperating with the probe 
grays response rallied his supporters he not only survived but 
won the whips job handily over reps beryl anthony dark and 
david bonior dmich 
the whips job is that of chief votecounter and headknocker 
for the democratic leadership as it tries to pass legislation 
grays busy schedule of campaigning speechmaking and other 
travel including his church duties has made him a lessvisible 
presence on the house floor than his predecessors 
he relies on his staff to carry out the dull but important 
details of the job and checks in by phone from the road 
in his first year as whip gray also has deferred to majority 
leader richard gephardt and speaker thomas foley when it comes to 
leading the party charge on major issues 
his style has earned him the inhouse moniker the stealth 
whip and a few fellow democrats grumble privately that 
republicans have squeezed through some things they shouldnt have 
but hes lost only on one major vote so far when the house last 
year passed president bushs capital gains tax cut over the 
objections of the democratic leadership 
that was one we never could win gray recalls 
his low profile is deliberate he explains 
i see myself as the chief of the engine room he says the 
speaker and the majority leader are up on the bridge calling for 
full speed ahead and ive got to give it to them

editors note tourist guidebooks rarely tell you that there 
was once a hotel in washington with cells in the basement to hold 
newly purchased slaves or that blacks were once forbidden to 
perform at constitution hall or that blacks were barred from 
sitting in the audience at the national theater but that has 
changed with publication of a new book looking at the black side of 
the blackest big city in america 
</TEXT>

when the rest of america thinks of washington 
the city not washington the world capital what easily comes to 
mind is crime drugs poverty corruption 
washington did have 438 homicides last year more than one a 
day it does have an infant mortality rate like that of third world 
countries a fifth of its people do live in poverty its mayor was 
put on trial for using cocaine 
all too true but incomplete washington is also a community a 
place to grow up in a place where people worry about tent 
caterpillars harangue the city government to get a new trash can 
and take pride in sons and daughters marching to pomp and 
circumstance at high school graduations 
it has a state bird the wood thrush flower the american 
beauty rose and tree the scarlet oak 
two things make it different it is the national capital and it 
is the blackest big city in america seventy percent of its 
residents are black a higher proportion than atlanta detroit 
newark nj or birmingham ala 
washingtons status as capital and black city have intersected 
for generations and history largely hidden has been made at the 
intersection 
a new guidebook the guide to black washington by two 
washingtonians one white one black offers a chance to glimpse 
washington as a black place and as a place where blacks made 
history 
the guide is intended to fit into a cars glove compartment 
offering a few paragraphs on the schools churches theaters 
homes hotels monuments cafes even the alleys important to 
washingtons history as a black city 
for 200 years say authors sandra fitzpatrick and maria r 
goodwin the threads of two distinct communities have been woven 
through the intricate web of federal and local interests in 
washington the traditionally dominant white population and a 
vibrant thriving black community which has attained majority 
status over the past three decades 
so while other guidebooks tell how many steps there are to the 
top inside the washington monument 898 this one suggests how 
confusing the ground rules must have been when washington was 
rigidly segregated by law and custom 
heres how confusing 
black people could sit in the audience of constitution hall but 
blacks could not perform on stage 
black actors on the other hand could play the national 
theater but blacks were barred from attending performances 
at griffith stadium the old ballpark blacks could cheer the 
washington senators but until baseball broke the color line after 
world war ii no black could play for the senators or any other 
major league team 
however the national negro league had use of the field when the 
senators were on the road 
one day in 1942 the often somnambulantsenators drew all of 
3000 fans for an afternoon game that night the black homestead 
grays drew 28000 
thats the kind of everyday history ms fitzpatrick and ms 
goodwin revel in 
we wrote the book for the white and black residents and to get 
the tourists off the mall says ms fitzpatrick the mall is 
fine but theres more to this town than that 
ms fitzpatrick white is the coowner of a washington art 
gallery and wife of a prominent lawyer she grew up in west 
lafayette ind but shes lived in washington since 1959 long 
enough to be considered a washingtonian as a guide on smithsonian 
walking tours she came to know all the citys neighborhoods white 
and black 
ms goodwin is a historian for the us mint she was 
researching a bibliography of washingtons history when she and 
mrs fitzpatrick found each other and decided to collaborate 
their guide recaptures the flavor of the time when the howard 
theater the citys first legitimate theater for blacks would put 
on four shows a day at 2 5 730 and 10 pm and again at 
midnight on saturdays 
in sharp contrast to the stiffnecked segregation at the 
national theater whites could make up a quarter of the audience at 
the howard and white bands such as artie shaws often performed 
on stage pearl bailey made her show business debut there as a 
member of the chorus line the howardettes 
the guide calls attention to institutions still flourishing 
like bens chili bowl where comedian bill cosby courted his wife 
and still drops in when hes in town as well as landmarks long 
gone some gone with good riddance

blissfully gone are the alleys of shacks which for a century 
were to washington what tenements were to new york squalid 
unwholesome smelly places only their names were attractive 
slop bucket row and louse alley were on capitol hill in goat 
alley in the shaw neighborhood lived 400 black people and one 
white family in 1900 
long gone too is the st charles hotel on pennsylvania avenue 
which before the civil war catered to a southern clientele it 
provided six basement cells where guests could keep slaves newly 
purchased from the citys slave market a sign posted by management 
made this offer in case of escape full value of the negro will 
be paid by the proprietor 
lincoln ended slavery in washington but segregation only became 
more deeply entrenched 
long before the lincoln memorial was erected and dedicated at 
a 1922 ceremony at which honored black guests sat in an allnegro 
section freed black slaves collected money to erect their own 
tribute to the great emancipator 
the emancipation memorial near capitol hill is a statue 
portraying a black man breaking his chains as lincoln holds the 
emancipation proclamation in his outstretched hand 
in 1939 the steps of the lincoln memorial were the scene of an 
extraordinary concert a landmark event in black and washington 
history 
contralto marian anderson sang there before 75000 people on an 
easter sunday she had been denied use of constitution hall by its 
owners the daughters of the american revolution 
twentyfour years later martin luther king jr standing at the 
same place delivered his i have a dream speech during a march 
on washington to petition congress to pass a civil rights bill 
we were struck by how many of our black neighbors played out 
their lives on the national stage says ms fitzpatrick 
she ticks some off jazzman duke ellington who grew up on t 
street and also played the howard theater a handsome local bridge 
is named for him now charles houston mr civil rights who 
argued cases before the supreme court including the monumental 
brown vs board of education which desegregated schools across 
america and in its capital and frederick douglass the early black 
statesman namesake of another bridge in this city of rivers 
douglass born into slavery escaped to the north bought his 
own freedom with his own earnings and as an antislavery lecturer 
became the spokesman for his race 
lincoln called him the most meritorious man of the 19th 
century he lived in a row house near the capitol he spoke at 
the dedication of the emancipation memorial president ulysses s 
grant was a guest

editors note an american reporter looking for inexpensive 
accommodations in japan checked into a zen buddhist temple with the 
understanding that he would partake of the rituals he learned what 
its like to get whacked by a monk on the other side of the globe 
a former heroin addict has spent months in a buddhist monastery in 
new yorks catskill mountains trying to kick his habit here are 
two stories

the burly blackrobed zen buddhist monk 
casually showed the wooden staff he uses to beat people who slump 
or sleep during meditation 
only later after it was applied to me with extreme vigor did i 
realize he was asking if it was all right to use it to improve my 
meditating stance 
we were in the laymens zen hall of myoshinji temple i had 
asked a friend to help me find cheap accommodation in kyoto and 
1333 for a night at myoshinji seemed quite within reason 
the only catch is that the guest must try to transcend reason 
through zen and accept the discipline aimed at enlightenment 
the monk kodo yoshitomi his bald head gleaming under the 
ultraviolet lights in a large matcovered room explained the 
basics of zen meditation he demonstrated the crosslegged lotus 
position with deep breathing and eyes focused on a point a yard 
ahead he told of chanting sutras and trying not to think 
i said that not thinking is difficult he laughed and agreed 
this is very hard to explain to mr foreigner says yoshitomi 
who is in his late 20s 
he told me to sit on a round black pillow atop a 2footsquare 
cloth mat after 15 minutes a master monk and 12 mostly 
middleaged students including a woman came into the room and 
assumed the lotus position on other pillows 
most of the students wore western clothes but a few wore robes 
the woman wore a coarse blue robe one man was with his teenage 
son 
we were lined up in two facing rows with the elderly master 
kobun harada at the front of the room the monks sounded a bell 
and wooden clapper to signal the beginning of deep breathing then 
a triple bell to mark the start of meditation 
yoshitomi walked up and down the rows brandishing the staff he 
stopped in front of one student who had been slumping the student 
still sitting bowed and lifted his hands in a prayer gesture then 
leaned over with his left hand gripping his right shoulder 
tap tap whack whack the staff swung into the left upper back 
of the student who then put his right hand on his left shoulder 
tap tap whack whack 
the student and yoshitomi bowed to each other and the monk 
walked on down the row 
i tried breathing deeply five seconds in five seconds out 
focusing just ahead and trying to rid my mind of thoughts the 
primary thought was that my leg was falling asleep aching and 
becoming numb traffic noise made it hard to concentrate 
yoshitomis soft footsteps grew closer he stopped in front of 
me glasses off whispered student sukuki hiroshi sitting 
beside me yoshitomi pointed to my watch and i took that off too 
i bowed down and the monk put my hand on the proper shoulder a 
couple of taps and the wood sliced through the air onto my upper 
back with two tremendous whacks i winced yoshitomi hit the other 
side of my upper back twice then put the staff against my spine 
and pushed me against it to straighten me we bowed and he moved on 
after the initial sting wore off i felt refreshed the beatings 
had gotten the circulation going again and the idea of being 
beaten made me want to laugh i returned to trying to meditate with 
renewed enthusiasm 
i succeeded in not thinking for a few seconds at a time but 
then id think hey its working im not thinking and return 
to the eternal internal jabbering 
i thought about whether i would be beaten again what wed have 
for breakfast my wife and children sleep sex and how to say 
these things in japanese 
i thought about things i had read about zen including essays by 
american trappist monk thomas merton that sought to bring together 
buddhist and christian contemplation i felt inspired to learn more 
about zen whose emphasis on simplicity selfdiscipline and 
oneness with nature is crucial to understanding japan

but mostly i pondered the discomfort of the lotus position 
one foot tingled then ached then grew so numb i couldnt move 
my toes i glanced down thought i saw it turning blue and 
wondered if enlightenment was worth losing a foot 
but every few minutes especially when yoshitomi crept by with 
the staff i made sure i was sitting upright 
finally the bell rang the wooden clapper sounded four times and 
everybody changed leg positions the feeling was just returning to 
my leg when we began another 20minute round during which a few 
other students were whacked 
the bell and clapper sounded again and everyone stood up and 
collected thin mattresses from a closet and spread them on the 
floor in the sleeping room 
we had a tea break at a table with western chairs the other 
students were interested in my impressions of japan and in the 
variety of ethnic groups in the united states 
hiroshi said he had been studying zen every weekend for a year 
at the laymens center which has about 1200 participants another 
man said he had been coming for 10 years no one indicated a desire 
to become a fulltime monk 
i slept well despite the traffic loud snoring from some 
students and the lack of a shower 
at 5 am we were awakened and carrying our pillows under 
folded arms we were led singlefile along a street into the temple 
compound and into the 660yearold wooden temple 
the dawn was bright the air fresh and the temple grounds quiet 
except for singing birds and the scrape of our templeissue sandals 
against gravel i inhaled the aroma of ancient pines and felt this 
was about as far east as one could get 
we sat on our pillows on a tatamimat platform and two monks 
sat by the altar under colored banners 
we meditated for 20 minutes during which most of us were 
whacked then began a series of chants most students had memorized 
them but some read from a pamphlet 
the syncopated lowpitched drone of the chants accompanied by 
a drum was compelling and hypnotic at the end they slowed down 
and ended in a falling sound 
after another 20minute meditation we walked briskly around the 
temples outer stone platform for about 10 minutes then into 
another building for a breakfast that defined austerity we kneeled 
on tatami mats around some low wooden benches where yoshitomi 
explained the ritual for eating 
we gave a chant of thanksgiving two other monks brought in a 
tub of rice gruel and ladled it into our bowls after each person 
bowed and scraped the palm in a brisk gesture 
each of us also had a little bowl of fried tofu with grated 
radish and a small dish of pickles we put a bitesized offering of 
gruel on the bench beyond the bowl then ate quickly shoving in 
the wet gruel with chopsticks 
yoshitomi told us to save the last yellow pickle which we used 
with tea to wash out the bowls we each put our single plum pit 
into a bucket held by the monks stacked the bowls and put them in 
another bucket then stacked the benches 
back at the laymens center we swept the tatami mats and 
scrubbed them with rags then we sat on the mat in the sleeping 
room for tea cookies and an informal meeting we introduced 
ourselves and asked questions of harada the master who seemed 
kindly and easygoing 
afterward hiroshi gave me a ride to the midpriced hotel where 
i would spend the next night wallowing in the putrefaction of 
relative luxury but that didnt bother me because i knew now that 
it was all an illusion

heroin addict keith scofield had three 
choices go to jail go to colorado for drug treatment or check 
into a monastery 
he chose the latter dai bosatsu zendo a buddhist monastery 
sitting atop a mountain in the catskills about 80 miles northwest 
of new york city 
scofield is about a third of the way through a selfimposed 
twoyear sentence as a zen novice using 2500yearold meditation 
techniques to relieve his craving for drugs 
if i had gone back into drug treatment i would have wound up 
back in jail or dead says scofield 31 a heroin addict since 
he was 13 five previous drug programs had failed him 
the reason i got lost into drugs is that i didnt care he 
adds 
in colorado he would have spent two years in a boot campstyle 
program where i would have been thinking dont just shave my 
head and have me scrub floors with a toothbrush give me something 
new something to be excited about 
scofields foray into buddhism began a year ago when he was 
sitting in loudoun county jail in virginia he was jailed in june 
1989 after he was caught shoplifting a violation of his 1988 
probation for drug possession that drug arrest came after he 
overdosed on heroin 
in his cell scofield began reading zen manuals and meditating 
after five months he went before a judge who gave him two options 
five years in prison or two years at the colorado military camp 
scofield encouraged by the tranquillity he had found through 
buddhism suggested a monastery as a third alternative 
the judge agreed with the understanding that if scofield left 
the monastery before his two years ended or if he broke the monks 
rules he would be jailed for five years 
last december scofield was freed and exiled himself to the 
remote monastery which can be reached only by a 20mile trip up a 
winding narrow dirt road his case was assigned to a new york 
probation officer 
since then scofields days have begun at 5 am with a regimen 
of chanting meditation manual labor yoga and spartan vegetarian 
meals 
some people thought i somehow scammed my way out of a prison 
sentence scofield says but if i had chosen jail i could have 
just sat tight done my time and walked out 
he also could have been paroled in less than two years 
conventional drug treatment gave scofield the rational reasons 
to quit drugs but no emotional or spiritual ones he says a year 
was the longest he stayed off drugs after conventional treatment 
the introspective searching of zen philosophy fills that void 
he says 
drugs are a symptom youve got to come to a deeper 
realization of the truth says monastery vice abbot junpo dennis 
kelly 
kelly who was reluctant to let scofield come to the monastery 
now gives 2to1 odds that buddhism will help him overcome his 
addiction 
at first i said hes a junkie and junkies break down 
kelly says youve got to be desperate to come here because this 
is spiritual graduate school but keiths been a very very good 
student 
kelly says his own background as an lsd manufacturer and user 
makes him sympathetic to scofield kelly spent a year in federal 
prison in the 1980s for drug trafficking 
scofield could be a pioneer for the monastery which may take in 
more criminal drug users that would have been unthinkable two 
years ago says abbot eido roshi who founded the traditional 
japanese monastery in 1976 but the monastery is americanizing 
itself blending zen spiritual tradition with western worldliness 
drug rehabilitation experts say they had never heard of anyone 
trying to overcome addiction at a monastery but conceded that 
different addicts need different handling 
recovery is a journey for anyone who is addicted and people 
take different paths in their recovery says jane fedderly 
spokeswoman for the hazeldon rehabilitation center in center city 
minn 
the name of the game is recovery i wouldnt knock what hes 
doing 
scofields wellordered 16hour days are at least as taxing as 
the boot camp that awaited him in colorado he says and monastic 
life is far more strenuous than life in prison or a conventional 
drug program 
yet hes approaching his new life with zeal the day begins with 
group chanting before the monasterys carved wooden buddha after 
breakfast scofield works chopping wood painting repairing walls 
and ceilings 
four hours of meditation are spread throughout the day the 
longest period coming before the lights go out at 9 pm 
i really got lucky scofield says i didnt know what sort 
of place this would turn out to be i remember thinking what if 
its an old barn with 20 monks sitting in a circle chanting but 
then i thought it really doesnt matter as long as i change my 
life what i had before wasnt really much of a life

editors note garage sales people unloading the unwanted 
have developed into a multimilliondollar industry no one has a 
good handle on the scope of the nations driveway economy but 
theres a whole lot of secondhand retailing going on 
</TEXT>

comedian phyllis diller used to cruise garage 
sales searching for treasures among trash 
i bought eight guitars at a st louis garage sale once she 
says at that same sale i bought a blonde wig and i used that as 
my fright wig in all my shows boy its ugly 
diller and people like her support nations driveway economy in 
which millions of dollars change hands every season 
summers here and so are garage tag rummage and yard sales 
call them what you want theyre put on by people who want to 
unload the unwanted 
take a look at the classified section of this newspaper chances 
are youll find a separate listing just for garage sales thursday 
is a big day for newspaper ads since the sales frequently run 
friday through sunday 
theres a whole lot of retailing going on 
just ask chris stevenson author of garage sale mania how to 
hold a profitable garage yard or tag sale 
there is so much money in this just for a weekend he said 
from huntington beach calif its a multimilliondollar 
business 
getting an accurate fix on garagesale revenue is impossible 
in michigan for example the state treasury and commerce 
department doesnt track money changing hands at the sales all 
those dusty bicycles flower vases and sets of three matching 
glasses arent subject to state sales tax since theyre used items 
and not sold in a licensed business 
to help get an idea of how much money passes through these 
private flea markets look at livonia a bedroom community of about 
105000 people west of detroit 
last year livonia issued 2792 garage sale permits at a buck 
apiece forgetting that some sales escaped the permit process that 
works out to 03 garage sales per person per year 
now for the money the fuzz factor gets kind of heavy here but 
stevenson says a typical garage sale nets about 100 
that means that garage sales shoppers in michigan fork over 
about 28 million a year for other peoples junk thats slightly 
more than the annual budget for the entire state park system 
take that nationwide and the driveway economy adds up to about 
720 million annually 
where theres money theres a whole lot of advice on how to 
deal with it including some from diller 
a few years ago she made a videotape called how to have a 
moneymaking garage sale its just now being distributed 
i realized that people were not being efficient she said 
from chesaning mich where she was appearing in a play theyre 
good for the environment because you dont throw it away or bury 
it 
some tips from her video 
check with your insurance company 
plan on onetenth of the original price for clothes and 
onefifth for working appliances 
for security never publish a phone number in advertisements 
the latest edition of books in print lists four titles 
beginning with the words garage sale including stevensons 
stevenson says weapons are hot sellers we bought some rifles 
for 3995 and revarnished the stocks and blued the barrels and 
sold them for 6995 he says 
tools and tool chests exercise equipment and clothing also do 
well stevenson says mattresses and box springs are losers as are 
jigsaw puzzles which often are incomplete 
inventory arrangement can help at the cash box sometimes its 
beneficial to arrange male and femaleoriented items on separate 
tables with genderneutral items such as luggage in between 
stevenson also has some strategies for people who are serious 
about becoming garage sale barons like him stevensons 
brotherinlaw got him hooked on other peoples castoffs 
we learned how to run around and buy out other garage sales in 
a bidout he says we would take the total inventory of a 
sale for a set price usually we would do this early in the morning 
if they refused us we would hit them early in the afternoon 
and see if they would take our price usually lower than in the 
morning 
the deals usually were accepted 
garage sale prowlers usually fit into one of four general 
categories 
the idly curious fairweather shoppers usually traveling in 
couples who fork over a dime here or a quarter there big spenders 
theyre not 
the jokesters the next time you get a gag gift at a birthday 
party or a family gettogether it probably was picked up at a 
garage sale by one of these characters some considerable money 
maybe 5 or so can be involved in a transaction 
the true bargainhunters these are a sellers dream 
frequently these are people with real money looking for bicycles 
or bigticket baby stuff such as cribs swings or high chairs 
sometimes theyre hunting for true moneymakers such as washing 
machines and dryers 
the hardcore garage sale prowler the bane of all hosts these 
solo shoppers come armed with large bags for little stuff theyll 
quibble over a nickel on a 15cent onetime family heirloom 
unconcerned or oblivious that theyre asking for a 33percent 
discount 
making money despite deep discounts may be the secondmost 
important factor in evaluating the success of a garage sale 
its not the money one garage sale host says its the 
cubic yards removed

editors note carnegie hall once doomed to destruction 
celebrates its 100th birthday this season thank isaac stern the 
virtuoso violinist who has been president of the new york concert 
hall for the past 30 years rarely has a musician been so closely 
associated with a place 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to isaac stern carnegie hall is a mystical 
place the mount olympus of american music for good reason 
the storied new york concert hall is where stern first vaulted 
into preeminence as a virtuoso violinist he returned the favor 
years later by saving carnegie hall from oblivion 
that was 30 years ago today as carnegie hall prepares to 
celebrate its 100th birthday stern reflects on its rich history as 
the cradle of american culture in the 20th century 
carnegie hall is entwined completely with the artistic 
emotional intellectual political growth of this country stern 
says its astonishing 
carnegie hall he adds was the place where you came to prove 
whether you belonged or not it has been the crown proving place 
for every single orchestra every conductor every pianist singer 
violinist cellist 
you walk in there you think of all the people whove been 
there its the center from which the entire development of 
american music came nothing happened in this country that didnt 
come through carnegie 
as a performer the violinist says carnegie hall makes a 
performance larger than life its an enormously powerful hall and 
it does give even average performers a glamour and power they 
wouldnt have in other halls 
with its coming 19901991 blockbuster season carnegie hall 
celebrates its 100th anniversary stern who celebrated his 70th 
birthday on july 21 says the important thing is to make sure 
itll be here for the next 100 years 
its something to hold on to some connection with mans 
involvement with education with the quality of civilization 
as for his own birthday he says i very honestly feel as if 
im reaching a good time of my middle age of course id be a 
little more sure of it if i knew very active people who were 140 
at a birthday celebration concert in san francisco actor 
gregory peck called stern an irresistible oneman cultural 
force 
surely no virtuoso instrumentalist has been as allied with a 
place as stern with carnegie hed played in new york twice at town 
hall receiving mild notices before performing at carnegie for the 
first time at age 22 in january 1943 reviews glowed 
that was the start of the career really he says from 
then on things really took off 
at home in manhattan wearing a shortsleeved shirt on a 
90degree day his glasses pushed atop his white hair stern agrees 
to pose for a picture holding his guarneri violin but he doesnt 
follow the photographers suggestion to hug the instrument with 
crossed arms 
unlike a woman you embrace a violin with great care not with 
great abandon he explains its more like a baby 
stern muses that 1943 in carnegie hall saw the start of the 
leonard bernstein era when the young assistant conductor of the 
new york philharmonic substituted on short notice for the ailing 
bruno walter 
it was the year the duke ellington band played black brown 
and beige starting ellingtons annual carnegie concerts 
premiering his extended compositions which often expressed racial 
pride 
stern recalls some of the historic concerts he attended at 
carnegie the great return of pianist vladimir horowitz after his 
absence the american debut of soviet violinist david oistrakh the 
last performances of violinist fritz kreisler 
it was clear kreisler was going to go into retirement at that 
time i remember particularly his last orchestral concert eugene 
ormandy wrapped him in musical cotton to take care of him during 
that whole performance it was moving touching very dear 
he remembers the time pianist arthur rubinstein gave 10 recitals 
in a row all of them for charity marian andersons farewell 
eleanor roosevelt coming to listen to a high school graduation 
performance 
in 1960 when lincoln center was being built and the new york 
philharmonic about to move from carnegie to the new philharmonic 
hall in the new music and theater complex the plan was to tear 
down the privately owned carnegie hall and build an office tower 
starting with meetings in friends apartments stern began raising 
money to mount a campaign to save the hall 
did he really think he could save it or was he making a symbolic 
gesture 
i never was a don quixote stern says i dont tilt at 
empty windmills i was completely convinced i was going to win if 
i had been less innocent i might have been afraid of how possible 
it was to lose 
i wasnt entirely innocent politically i knew i had to work 
politically 
after we knew we had won the fight and they were drafting the 
legislation that let the city buy carnegie hall i left as a member 
of a group to do a tour while we were in europe they voted me in 
as president of carnegie i havent quit yet 
being president of carnegie hall for 30 years has taken more 
time than most concert performers would be willing to sacrifice 
from their musical careers he hasnt minded stern says because 
the violin gave me the impetus and power to work for carnegie and 
that gave me a different set of tensions to make going back to the 
violin even more pleasurable 
stern has long worked to help fledgling musicians 
being of service has always seemed very natural to me i cant 
give you a reason i never thought of it as being of service 
people have been very nice to me ive been very fortunate a long 
time ago without being philosophical or creating a credo i just 
figured one has been fortunate so one has to give something back 
you dont just take so i do that 
im interested to tell young people why you play what happens 
between the notes where the music is made and to teach teachers 
how to get excited about how music is part of our lives 
a movie from mao to mozart in which stern shares music 
with youngsters in china won an oscar for best fulllength 
documentary in 1981 
stern and his wife vera have two sons who are conductors one 
married to a violinist the other engaged to an oboist their 
daughter and her husband who have three sons are both rabbis 
with synagogues 12 miles apart in new jersey 
vera and the children have helped me always stern says 
were a very close family we believe in loving and touching and 
thats a help

dont be surprised if jane curtin loses 
control occasionally in her role as a divorced mother in the nbc 
fall show working it out 
in the pilot for the new saturday night comedy which costars 
stephen collins she had wanted to show that she was not reprising 
her emmywinning role from kate amp allie 
it was important for me to show that she was very different 
from allie that she had everything under control she says 
but the pilot seemed to be too onenote she was too much in 
control 
in the future well show that beneath that shes lava liquid 
rock youll see her control crumble from time to time it makes 
her more human 
curtin stars as sarah marshall the divorced mother of a 
9yearold she isnt looking for any new relationships until she 
meets david stuart collins at a cooking class stuart is a 
photographer who has finally gotten his own daughter out of the 
house and isnt interested in anyone with a young child of course 
that all goes out the window as they start working it out 
curtins last regular character allie had considerably less 
control of her life curtin costarred with susan saint james for 
five years in kate amp allie allie was a homebody with two 
children who preferred standing over a hot stove to dating she 
was a great cook who could never get a grip on things although in 
the final season in 1988 she got married 
this fall nbc has all halfhour comedies on saturday including 
three new shows parenthood based on the hit movie begins the 
night followed by working it out the returning hit shows 
the golden girls empty nest and carol amp co and 
another new comedy american dreamer 
cbs counters with a mixture of comedy drama and news while abc 
has three onehour dramas including twin peaks at 10 pm 
working it out like kate amp allie and saturday night 
live is produced in new york other than a few movies curtin 
has worked mostly in new york to be near her husband and daughter 
she talked about the show during a brief visit to los angeles to 
promote the series 
i was looking for a project and was in contact with bill 
persky she said persky had been the executive producer of 
kate amp allie he was doing a film and i thought i should go 
off and do something different then at the last minute we felt we 
should do something together he sent me a pilot script he had 
written and many lunches and calories later we decided to go with 
it billy didnt write it for me and originally he only wanted me 
to look at it but i liked it and wanted to work with billy again 
if you have the same rhythm as billy and i do its the best 
condition for working you just fly through hes very open to 
suggestions you never feel inhibited 
prior to working it out curtin had spent some time 
developing a comedy news show with buck henry and others 
it would have been like one of those pontifical roundtable 
shows she says we kept trying to get something on as a 
segment of the connie chung show it didnt work out that was last 
november and every time we did anything the events changed 
curtin had been an anchor on weekend update on saturday night 
live after the departure of chevy chase 
she had been with the proposition an improvisational theater 
group before joining saturday night live in 1975 as an 
original member of the not ready for prime time players 
the proposition would occasionally perform on television 
she says usually after each performance wed never be invited 
back because wed manage to offend them in some way 
curtin reportedly said on leaving saturday night live that 
she would never return asked if she would ever return for a guest 
role she flashes a grin and replies if it were on earlier say 
9 or 930 pm 
she left the latenight show in 1980 and went on to continued 
television stardom she won two emmys for her role in kate amp 
allie she did not achieve the feature film success of such snl 
alums as chase dan aykroyd and john belushi and later billy 
crystal bill murray and eddie murphy 
one of her first movies was how to beat the high cost of 
living which went nowhere the movie however did team her for 
the first time with susan saint james which may have figured in 
their pairing later in kate amp allie garrett morris also from 
saturday night live was also in the movie as was dabney 
coleman her costar in the tv movie maybe baby she starred 
with tom selleck in divorce wars 
this past season she played alice mcgoff a widow with seven 
children who fought school integration in boston in the miniseries 
common ground that was the first bluecollar role for curtin 
and a change of pace 
its so hard to hide good breeding she jokes its a 
curse

dont look for oneshot guest stars at the 
guthrie theater no television personalities and movie names 
brought in for marquee value or to give the box office a boost 
the guthrie is a company of actors 23 at last count who have 
made a nearly yearround commitment to the regional theater and its 
artistic director garland wright 
that was one of the reasons wright took the job in the summer of 
1986 it was a chance to build a permanent troupe of performers 
able to jump from shakespeare to shaw from wilde to wilder with 
ease 
the classical companys current challenging efforts are good 
examples of giving actors and audiences a stretch three 
shakespeare history plays richard ii henry iv and 
henry v are being performed in repertory all summer 
the emphasis in doing these plays was the acting company 
says charles newell who codirected the trio of shakespeare epics 
with wright the plays were chosen with the company in mind we 
didnt go to new york to get the leads and then cast the secondary 
parts locally which has been the case in the past 
casting from new york or los angeles or chicago is common 
practice among a lot of regional theaters most performers cant 
afford a steady diet of regional theater work 
when actors work mainly on a freelance basis they can do a 
soap opera for maybe 10 weeks at 3000 a week and then do a play 
at a regional theater for 300 a week says edward martenson the 
guthries executive director 
in other words the commercial side of their existence is 
subsidizing the art side he says its a question of at what 
level can actors afford to give up that commercial side in order to 
do what theyd like to do 
the guthrie which has a yearly operating budget of about 95 
million has tried to snare actors with two promises most 
performers cant resist good roles and more money 
the money is linked to an ambitious 25 million endowment plan 
which was started in the spring of 1987 and which martenson hopes 
to have closed out by the end of 1991 so far more than 16 
million has been raised much of it in large gifts from 
corporations and donations from several individuals 
our reasoning was that we could not hope to compete with the 
resources they have in hollywood or on broadway in terms of a 
weekly salary martenson says instead what were looking for 
is the ability of an actor or actress to settle here and make a 
fulltime commitment 
one actress who has done just that is brenda wehle who plays 
small roles in henry iv and henry v and will have a major 
part in the skin of our teeth and the title role in medea 
when they open later in the season 
wehle first came to minneapolis five years ago for five months 
with a production of eric overmyers on the verge directed by 
wright she was living in philadelphia at the time and going where 
she had to places such as hartford conn and seattle for 
acting jobs 
garland called seven months later when i was back in 
philadelphia and he said can you be here in two weeks for longer 
than five months she recalls i moved out bought a house 
with a white picket fence bought a car all the dreams you have 
put my two children in school and began as a member of the new 
company four seasons ago 
charles janasz who plays richard ii ned poins in henry iv 
and the dauphin in henry v arrived at the guthrie last year 
he had been in a similar acting company at arena stage in 
washington and loved it 
he also had tried new york and found he had to go outoftown to 
get work 
unless youre dead set on making a career move into film and 
television i see no reason for not moving here unless you like 
instability he says im happy when im working and im not 
happy when im not working so when i was living in new york the 
only time i was happy was when i was away from home 
other actors in the company came from as far away as across 
town local actors wright has pulled into his troupe stephen 
yoakam who plays bolingbroke in richard ii and later the title 
character in henry iv went to college in minneapolis and for 
the most part stayed 
in 1986 the guthrie had only six actors under contract for a 
year but the most any actor could earn then in a full season at 
the guthrie was 24000 martenson says 
on that you cant buy a house settle down and have a 
family he says our objective was to get to an average of 950 
a week which would work out for a 45week season to a little 
more than 42000 a year that would put our highest salary at 
something like 50000 for a fulltime actor on that we feel 
people can afford to make a fulltime commitment to us 
those levels havent been reached yet 
weve still got two steps to go phased in over a period of 
six years martenson says but the progress that weve made so 
far and the commitments that weve gotten from people make it clear 
that the money increase has been a very significant factor 
the variety and quality of the roles offered these actors have 
been just as important in compelling them to stay at the guthrie 
theres been a steady upward climb in terms of the size of the 
roles weve been undertaking and the responsibility that has been 
given to us as members of an ensemble yoakam says

blue steel mgmua home video vshbeta 8998 rated r 
 
blue steel the story of a rookie cop in new york city who 
unwittingly falls in love with a crazed killer might better be 
titled aww come on after the chorus of incredulous groans it 
provokes 
viewing this movie is an exercise in good faith gone bad with 
scene after unbelievable scene that would force even the most 
gullible to get annoyed 
blue steel revolves around megan turner played by an ever 
lockedjawed jamie lee curtis in her quest to become a top cop and 
maybe even get a date once in awhile 
but in one of her first nights on the beat she blows away a 
grocery store robber in vicious fashion emptying a whole round 
into the guy since the robbers gun cant be found megan is 
suspended and told to give her triggerhappy fingers a rest 
enter the embodiment of seductive evil eugene hunt ron 
silver who witnessed the shooting and suddenly realizes megan is 
a kindred killer spirit 
hunt a wealthy commodities broker is the kind of smooth 
operator who takes his dates out to ritzy restaurants and then up 
for helicopter rides around manhattans glittery night skyline 
he wins over the lonely megan without telling her he saw the 
robbery and when hes not seducing the lady cop hes out randomly 
killing people on the streets of new york to declare his love for 
megan he scratches her name in the bullets 
this brings megan back on duty working with a team of homicide 
detectives who are trying to figure out why the killer is so 
obsessed with her 
what follows is a series of implausible plot developments the 
crack homicide team essentially lets the rookie megan run the 
investigation hunt a prime suspect is never given so much as a 
powderburn test to determine if hes involved in the spate of 
murders and at one point megan severely dazed and in shock is 
back on the streets to hunt down the killer 
aww come on 
to its credit blue steel does have a number of 
boogiemaninthe closet type thrills short bursts of 
cheaply orchestrated terror and silver does a fine job playing the 
psychotic devil in an italian suit his blood lust is so well done 
he somehow seems to revert to a primal evil animal state 
but in addition to the plot problems the dialogue is often slow 
and insipid heres an exchange after megan handcuffs her partner 
to a cars steering wheel so she can run after the killer by 
herself i almost got you killed megan says yeah that you 
did her partner responds adding you get some rest 
aww come on

lineage blue note benny green 
 
jazz pianist benny green is just 27 but he demonstrates a 
veterans appreciation and feel for classic jazz and bebop in his 
first solo title album lineage green plays strong and spunky 
on every selection chosen for this compact disc from bobby 
timmons dat dere to monks ask me now 
he also stretches his talents from fusion to show tunes he has 
included a wonderfully syrupy version of lerner and lowes if 
ever i would leave you and adds a light fusion number of his own 
called trust although his other three compositions steer 
closer to classic jazz 
green who has played with frank morgan betty carter and 
freddie hubbard is backed solidly by bassist ray drummond and 
victor lewis on drums but the album is clearly greens chance to 
shine the selection and order of numbers flow smoothly making for 
an impresive first album by an ascending new talent

carmen suite larlesienne suite no 1 symphony no 1 by 
georges bizet telarc cincinnati symphony orchestra jesus 
lopezcobos conductor 
 
oh well one might say here are a couple more war horses by a 
middlerank orchestra and ambitious conductor one might also be 
very much mistaken because this is a stunning recording 
lopezcobos draws out freshsounding vivid and supple 
performances with beautifully shaped lines and tight rhythmic 
control the orchestra glows and the winds play superbly a worthy 
compact disc

masses no 2 and 6 by franz schubert telarc atlanta 
symphony orchestra amp chorus conducted by robert shaw telarc 
 
shaw conducts detailed nicely phrased and wellbalanced if a 
little bland performances of a good sampling of schuberts sacred 
music on this compact disc generously timed at 7745 schubert 
wrote no 2 at the age of 17 and it is quite a bit simpler than 
no 6 which was composed in the final year of his pathetically 
short life 
the contrast is interesting in fact the straightforward 
innocence of the earlier work makes it more appealing the soloists 
are generally admirable particularly soprano dawn upshaw in no 2

blazing away island records marianne faithfull 
 
this mostly live offering by one of rocks legendary survivors 
carries a warning label about its lyrics but ought to caution 
listeners to beware its emotional punch 
twelve of the 13 songs were recorded during two 1989 concerts in 
a brooklyn ny cathedral in effect the collection is a musical 
autobiography of faithfull who burst onto the pop scene as a 
teenager in the 1960s faded away in a heroin haze in the 1970s 
and returned in the 80s with the critically acclaimed but 
hardtoenjoy album broken english 
i bought broken english in 1981 and gave it away not long 
after unable to bear the ragged voice that once had sung so 
sweetly on as tears go by 
faithfull sings as tears go by on blazing away and it is 
beautiful her voice is still harsh but the ache in it feels real 
and the spare arrangement featuring an accordion solo by garth 
hudson gently colors the melancholy mood 
the album also contains powerfully moving readings of john 
lennons working class hero and the rolling stones sister 
morphine a song for which faithfull wrote the lyrics during her 
longago union with mick jagger 
another highlight is the ballad of lucy jordan a song of 
middleage madness by shel silverstein that faithfull has made one 
of her signature tunes 
her band on the live numbers boasts in addition to hudson new 
orleans piano king dr john and guitarist marc ribot who also has 
played on recent tom waits and elvis costello recordings 
but despite the fine sound and faithfulls evocative vocals 
shes still a difficult act to enjoy many of her best songs are 
downers and the timbre of her voice reveals as much about pain and 
hard times as the lyrics 
there are rewards here but only for listeners willing to open 
their minds and drop their preconceptions

when julia roberts was 16 she saw the movie 
becket the richard burtonpeter otoole masterpiece about the 
stormy relationship between king henry ii and archbishop thomas 
becket and her future was instantly determined 
that movie had a more profound effect on me than any i had 
ever seen she remembers to see performances like the ones 
richard burton and peter otoole deliver it made me want to be 
that wonderful or at least really try 
it set a kind of standard somewhere in the back of my mind 
and it was something that in my lifetime i hoped id get a moment 
to achieve thats real absolute greatness if i could do that for 
a second id be a real happy actor 
at 23 she has come a long way toward achieving that goal 
faster than even she had hoped amid the gaggle of superstars in 
steel magnolias only roberts was nominated for an academy 
award next came pretty woman as a hollywood hooker to richard 
geres takeover tycoon the movie astounded everyone with a 160 
million gross and still counting 
she has a new film coming in august in flatliners kiefer 
sutherland kevin bacon william baldwin and roberts are medical 
students who try to probe the afterlife by stopping their vital 
signs its a thriller that scared even the actress it gets the 
heart pumping 
so does roberts beauty with her long auburn hair raphaellike 
face wide mouth and allknowing eyes she is a stunner offscreen 
and on add to the look a languorous voice shadowed by her youth in 
smyrna ga its no wonder that she has climbed into the 1 
millionperpicture category pretty woman has no doubt raised 
the ante 
she scoffs at claims she is an overnight sensation 
its kind of interesting how they can make five years seem 
like a long weekend she said it was a road traveled it 
wasnt quick although it came in a way i never anticipated but i 
also never predicted the outcome of what i was attempting to do i 
just delighted in the opportunities to keep doing it thats where 
the real excitement comes from every time you get a job you think 
you get another chance to show something 
roberts career as an actress was determined long before she saw 
becket both her parents were actors her brother eric 
roberts preceded her into films and won an academy award 
nomination for runaway train julia admits that she might have 
enrolled at the university of georgia gotten married and become a 
housewife if she hadnt left smyrna for new york after high school 
she attended acting classes and endless auditions before landing 
her first role at 18 in a crime story segment after a few 
lowbudget films she tried out for mystic pizza the role 
called for a portuguese waitress so she dyed her hair black she 
got the role 
she terms mystic pizza a nice surprise 
none of us on that movie had really done very much it was a 
chance to show somebody something 
producer ray stark liked what he saw he planted julia amid the 
highpowered women of steel magnolias sally field shirley 
maclaine dolly parton olympia dukakis the anticipated battle of 
temperments never developed 
they were all so available loving supportive giving 
tremendously caring women roberts said i had such an 
immediate rapport that i never really got a chance to think how 
scary this might have been or should have been really it was just 
very familiar from the start 
i never expected the nomination its a nice moment where 
theyre saying to you we accept you when youre saying youre an 
actor we believe you we trust that you can do what you say you 
can do thats a momentous honor 
as to the smash success of pretty woman robert said i 
dont ever look for the results of a piece of work when im 
working thats what im doing that particular day trying to make 
that work within the structure of the piece i dont take a movie 
thinking that its going to end up doing this particular amount of 
sales or that people will accept it in a certain way 
you can never know thats the unpredictable the reason all 
kinds of movies are made if there was a formula for the kind of 
movies people would go to see thats the only kind that would be 
made i dont dwell on something you cant figure out 
flatliners proposes the theory that another experience 
exists postmortem roberts goes along with it 
i think there is how could it all just turn black i dont 
believe that will happen somethings there

the restoration of an abandoned 
shopping mall to its turnofthecentury elegance has sparked hopes 
that other aging architectural gems may be preserved rather than 
knocked down or allowed to crumble 
galerias pacifico covers an entire city block along the florida 
street pedestrian walkway that cuts through the heart of buenos 
aires commercial district 
modeled on vittorio emanuele ii gallery in milan it was a 
showpiece from its marble halls to glass roof when it opened 100 
years ago 
i remember going there when i was a girl it was marvelous 
wonderful said nene martinez castro director of casa foa a 
group that redecorates interesting buildings and sells admission 
tickets to raise money for charity 
as an adult i thought it was a glory and then a shame when 
it went to waste she said 
galerias pacifico received a facelift of sorts in the 1940s 
huge frescoes by some of argentinas most gifted painters 
spilimbergo urruchua berni were added as decoration around a 
central dome but the glass roof was covered by an arch of 
reinforced concrete 
the building eventually was taken over by the state which tried 
beginning a decade ago to sell it services deteriorated and 
discouraged tenants left one by one 
in recent years galerias pacifico whose wellkept neighbors 
include the plaza hotel harrods department store and the 
glittering naval officers club became an eyesore of broken 
windows sagging marquees and boardedup entrances 
it was home no longer to boutiques for leather fur toys and 
books but to pigeons rats and decrepit men and women with no 
other place to call their own 
this capital city of 10 million has a lot of buildings that date 
back to when beef and grain exports made argentina one of the 
richest countries in the world and money was lavished on homes 
offices plazas and boulevards 
retiro train station inaugurated in 1915 was inspired by 
londons victoria station the facade of la prensa once the 
biggest newspaper in latin america recalls the paris opera 
many buildings boast art deco touches such as columns molded in 
the shape of giants who appear to sustain the structures on 
shoulders and backs of bulging muscle 
others have towering lobbies of italian marble stairways of 
german oak elevators with wrought iron grillwork and wooden 
benches interior patios with statues and fountains windows big 
enough to stand in balconies turrets gables cupolas 
the central hall of the national library is lined by bookcases 
of polished wood that stretch up several stories to a dome that 
allows in enough light to read by 
such buildings add to a citys culture a citys affluence 
its spirit said architect elizabeth kries im not against new 
things but there are some buildings that have values you should 
not lose 
while pleasing to the eye such buildings often are drafty 
awkward to organize and deficient in plumbing heating air 
conditioning and access for the handicapped 
the library train station and la prensa are in advanced states 
of deterioration when owners of other buildings were faced with 
finally doing something many concluded in the 1960s and 70s that 
it was easier to tear down than remodel 
everyone believed modern was better kries said the 
united states put a man on the moon people saw old buildings 
as old things old ideas they didnt appreciate them 
such thinking has begun to change 
casa foa last year redesigned an abandoned textile factory 
into spacious loft apartments that helped start a trend plans are 
afoot to do the same with warehouses along buenos aires decaying 
waterfront 
another group converted a derelict central market into an 
openair theater whose first production was federico garcia lorcas 
bodas de sangre blood wedding 
when it bought the alzaga unzue palace in downtown buenos aires 
several years ago the hyatt corporation reportedly intended to 
demolish the 76yearold mansion now company officials plan to 
use it as a lobby for what will be a fivestar hotel 
jose maria pena director of the city museum and a conservator 
who helped draft zoning laws to protect old buildings said its 
too soon to say if all that amounts to a trend 
in general builders still think its easier to take down a 
building and put up something new he said 
but pena added there are a lot of examples of restorations 
and there is a trend of people wanting to live in old buildings 
that have more space and privacy 
and buildings that look a little more distinguished 
a majority of buildings built in the 1960s and 70s have 
prematurely aged said pena they look more worn out than 
buildings built at the turn of the century that wear their age with 
dignity

michael penn carries the heaviest of show 
business burdens family connections 
and when one of your relatives has a reputation as a hotheaded 
bully the load of expectations doesnt get much lighter 
the older brother of actors sean and christopher penn has caught 
the publics attention with his debut album march a collection 
of songs about failed relationships set to a folksy sound that has 
been compared to the beatles 
at 30 penn knows a thing or two about failure hes now coming 
into his own after 12 years of trying to land a record deal 
after graduating from santa monica high school penn spent seven 
years kicking around the los angeles club scene with a band called 
doll congress at the same time his former sisterinlaw madonna 
was becoming the pop sensation of the 1980s 
i know that i may be possibly too patient of a person we kept 
getting so close to getting a deal where labels were interested and 
giving us money to go into the studio it never happened and yet 
we still stayed together because it was enough of an encouragement 
to keep plugging away he said 
i think it was when i came to the realization that i was not 
completely happy with the way things were going that it finally 
broke up 
penn departed the band in 1987 and took keyboardist patrick 
warren with him the pair met when warren answered a newspaper 
advertisement placed by penn 
patrick showed up to audition with a keyboard that didnt 
work and so the audition was basically us just talking he said 
their collaboration peaked in penns fourtrack home studio 
where he wrote the songs that eventually would end up on march 
he turned the results over to his manager who brought the tape to 
the attention of rca 
unlike every other time where there was like a lot of 
anticipation around a tape this time i just sort of said heres 
some new stuff im going to go back and work on some more stuff 
do with it what you will in a couple of weeks we started to get 
phone calls he said unfolding a tobaccofilled bandana to roll 
cigarettes 
no myth the albums first single rose to no 13 on the 
charts and the video received major exposure on music television 
two other singles this and that and brave new world have 
received extensive airplay 
i sort of smiled the most about the fact that it popped its 
head into all different formats there were people in all these 
little camps that responded to it which i thought was kind of 
cool said penn whose casual attire of a tank top blue jeans 
and cowboy boots kept him out of a restaurants dining room during 
a recent dinner 
the albums title doesnt have anything to do with the month of 
march either 
it was a realization while making the record that i have this 
subconscious tendency to write marches im not sure why but a lot 
of the beats on the record just felt like a march beat he said 
i think theres a lot of humor in the album its not 
something i really think about its just the way the songs come 
out certain lines make me laugh 
penn managed to keep his sense of humor during the 12 years he 
waited for his big break i was fully prepared to keep working 
the day jobs that were going nowhere to house and feed me to keep 
making music 
one of his worst jobs was as a customer service representative 
for a photography company that specialized in shooting debutante 
balls 
my job was answering phones and talking to the parents of 
these debutantes down south who were telling me the photographs 
didnt look like their daughters she wasnt that overweight or 
whatever he recalled with a chuckle 
eventually he was fired what got to my boss was my creative 
working hours i kind of wandered in a little after the first 
coffee break 
despite his resemblance to sean its the family name that 
brings up the comparisons and inevitable jokes about his brother 
instead of getting mad though penn admits to a perverse 
pleasure in seeing the frustration of reporters who want to fuss 
about his bloodlines 
whats been interesting to me is that a lot of the press gets 
frazzled by the fact that they couldnt make an issue out of it 
the fact that it wasnt an issue became the issue they wrote about 
because they had to find some way to include it he said 
even david letterman couldnt resist penn sat down to chat in 
his second appearance on the show and immediately got zinged 
so how old were you when sean threw his first punch 
letterman teased as penn managed a halfsmile 
letterman knew it was just a stupid comment and thats kind of 
his job he said 
penn says his family has rallied together in the face of a 
hostile celebrity press and public his father leo is a veteran 
television director and his mother eileen ryan is an actress 
i dont think you can be irish italian and jewish without 
being a close family he said 
he hasnt ruled out the possibility of having his father direct 
him in a video and his youngest brother is singing too 
lately christopher has been doing a lot of blues singing 
which is actually kind of cool hes got a great whiskey voice and 
hes pretty good at it 
while the rest of the family was acting penn was busy 
practicing guitar licks in the garage with his first band in junior 
high 
i knew i wanted to do music when i was 8 years old the songs 
are the things that appeal to me most about music he said 
alternating a bite of curried chicken with a drag on another 
cigarette 
thats what i did as a kid i never got into sports or 
anything else i just bought records and played guitar he said

forget the fire a character says in 
john edgar widemans new novel play with fire you know what 
happens youll get burnt like the rest of us 
wideman not known for sticking to safe topics cant forget the 
1985 move confrontation that killed 11 people and destroyed a 
philadelphia neighborhood 
i dont think its something that should be put to rest he 
said in a telephone interview from his home in amherst mass i 
think it should be kept alive and used creatively no more than 
the holocaust should be put to rest 
the acclaimed author of brothers and keepers and sent for 
you yesterday makes his case in philadelphia fire scheduled 
for september release by henry holt 
the move confrontation becomes a complex metaphor for black 
america urban decay love power and justice in the 
unconventional earthy narrative wideman alludes to the slave 
trade shakespeares caliban the birth of the blues and the 
drumbeat call of a basketball game in a west philadelphia park 
the books central character searches for a survivor of the 
fire but finds a reflection of himself instead the narrators son 
is in prison as is widemans though the author said the account 
is not strictly autobiographical 
all these characters merge he said they flow in and 
out 
wideman and his wife judy lived during the late 1960s on osage 
avenue two miles from where the move radicals later spent a year 
harassing their middleclass black neighbors and broadcasting 
obscenities and calls for revolution from a public address system 
day and night 
the narrator of philadelphia fire registers shock when he 
learns police bombed the radicals fortified row house may 13 
1985 and let a neighborhood burn in a bungled eviction attempt 
the narrator thinks hes looking at a war zone or a third 
world shantytown where theres no water no machines to extinguish 
a fire when the scene erupts on television 
wideman felt similar shock when he learned of the conflagration 
he said in the interview he had played basketball with people in 
the neighborhood and wondered how the crisis evolved 
something in a way had been done to me he said something 
had been done to my past as i learned more about the move people 
i recalled also that if i didnt know those particular people i 
knew people like them people who were around me people who had 
been dropouts who had been radicals in the 60s people who had 
given up on the system in the 60s black and white 
at the same time he said he shared the feelings of people who 
had been subjected to abuse by move members i have great 
sympathy and understanding of them because thats more or less the 
kind of world i come from he said theyre my people 
the fact that philadelphia had a black mayor w wilson goode 
made the story more complex he said 
thats another factor in the whole situation that made it 
worth writing about worth attempting to get to the core of he 
said first of all it was a little confusing another source of 
anger how could he do that how could one of us do that to us 
that was my immediate response my visceral response it became 
clear as i learned more and more that the mayor was in a sense a 
victim like everybody else 
in the fictional account there is just one survivor instead of 
two and the leader of a family similar to move is called king 
not john africa 
cudjoe the central character returns to his native 
philadelphia from greece to search for the survivor a boy named 
simba in an exchange with margaret jones a former follower of 
king he explains he wants to write a book about the fire its 
cause and meaning 
dont need a book she says anybody wants to know what it 
means bring them through here tell them these bombed streets used 
to be full of peoples homes tell them babies bones mixed up in 
this ash they smell 
cudjoes response i want to do something about the silence 
wideman said in the interview he believes people have tried to 
forget move out of fear he recalled a quaker memorial service he 
attended to which the mayor governor president police and others 
had been invited 
no officials showed up and just a handful of the convinced 
he said 
for it to be buried that way means that nobody really could 
understand the application whats at stake he said 
everybodys individuality and hope for any kind of decent life is 
at stake all citizens of philadelphia because if move can be 
wiped out today who tomorrow 
the move confrontation offers a special historical insight 
wideman said 
its not an isolated event he said to me its the 
culmination of the 60s its our societys our cultures answer 
to the question what do you do with people who are different 
when the mainstream is confronted by something as different as 
move democracy is tested he said 
move people were in lots of ways part of the 60s 
alienated turning away from the system reacting against excesses 
of big business corporations governments but this was 20 years 
later so what do you do with them well smash them murder 
them because there was no room for the option that they hold 
the story also concerns fathers and sons a topic of poignancy 
for wideman whose brother robert and son jacob are in prison 
for murder the narrator meditates on a legal system that he says 
allows his son to rot in confinement without treatment for mental 
illness 
wideman declined to answer questions about jacob the victims 
parents have sued the author for damages jacob also has confessed 
to a separate murder in wyoming 
but philadelphia fire suggests the anguish wideman has felt 
as it describes the difficulty of telephone conversations between a 
father and his imprisoned son 
ive learned the hard way that ive always known next to 
nothing about him the narrator says except i do know the 
danger of the place where hes incarcerated the depth of the 
trouble hes in the innocence and terror and guilt he must cope 
with day after day and little on the horizon but more of same 
the narrator later says a child lost cancels the natural 
order the circle is broken

billy joe royal marvels that he can 
still sing his hit record down in the boondocks in the same key 
as he did in 1965 
some other singers whove been around as long as me have 
dropped down a step royal says 
royal was a rock n roll star in the 1960s with such hits as 
down in the boondocks i knew you when cherry hill 
park and hush 
he kept singing through the 70s and 80s and had recording 
contracts much of the time and now that the 45yearold is going 
into his fourth decade behind the mike he has established a solid 
career in country music and even recently received his first gold 
record 
i was stubborn he says i just thought i had something 
left to say plus i thought there was a place for me in country 
music 
in the past five years his country hits include love has no 
right burned like a rocket ill pin a note on your 
pillow it keeps right on a hurtin and this summers 
searchin for some kind of clue 
his first gold album for sales of 500000 was the royal 
treatment 
in my era in the 60s if you sold 50000100000 albums that 
was a big album royal said reflectively in his music row office 
this album was a milestone for me 
his recent resurgence marks a remarkable comeback after a lean 
period in the late 70s and early 80s although he continued to 
sing he was away from the national limelight and at times was 
reduced to performing in hotel lounges 
youre sitting in a lounge just a few years after singing at 
the greek theater he recalled you wonder what happened 
his explanation is that records became group oriented then 
acid rock came along i didnt understand all that 
he sang in enough lounges and clubs to pay his bills at home in 
marietta ga and periodically visit nashville looking for a 
decent recording contract 
i used to stay at a motel outside of town because it was 
just 20 a day and i could make my money last longer royal said 
i could have picked up the phone and got work but the level i 
was on 
he finally signed with atlantic records the fourth major label 
of his career and moved comfortably into the country music market 
its not something foreign to me he said i knew as much 
about country as anything 
one key to his recent success has been four toprated music 
videos a part of the music business unheard of in his earlier 
performing years 
it means a lot to put a face with the music royal said 
and people saw that i wasnt 112 now using a walker 
these days hes on concert bookings with country kings such as 
george strait and alabama in the 1960s he was a member of dick 
clarks cavalcade of stars appearing with acts such as hermans 
hermits and paul revere and the raiders 
i felt like a fan on the bus he said reminiscing about his 
first months as a rock n roll star it all happened in six 
weeks time 
the centerpiece was down in the boondocks a song still 
heard on oldies radio stations and to this day the closing song at 
his concerts its about a poor young man in love with a rich girl 
i guess people related to poor people he said about the 
tunes appeal plus the sound of it was different we cut it on a 
threetrack machine the most primitive thing in the world how it 
sounded like a record i dont know 
once in a while i hear it on the radio and it still stands 
up the song meant everything to my career i was making about 125 
a week before that 
royal a native of valdosta ga doesnt listen much to rock 
n roll music anymore but he did like the recent hit songs the 
living years by mike plus the mechanics and talk it over by 
grayson hugh 
i listen to country stations and oldies stations and some 
gospel stations he said 
in view of his recent success he says he plans to keep plugging 
away on stage and on record five decades is within reach 
they are going to have to carry me off as long as somebody 
shows up ill be there

the unbelieveable truth 
the unbelieveable truth made for a whopping 200000 is a 
relative bargain in this summer of milliondollar adventures its 
a debut film irreverent and unpredictable but less selfassured 
when it tries to get serious 
the movie was written and directed by hal hartley who graduated 
from the film school of the state university of new york at 
purchase in 1984 and is a pretty irreverent sort himself he 
raised some of the money by telling the bank he was buying a word 
processor the actors are all virtually new to film and shooting 
on location at lindenhurst long island took just 11 days 
josh hutton robert burke is released from prison after serving 
time were told for raping and killing a girl and then killing 
her father dressed in black the softspoken josh is continously 
mistaken for a priest and must admit instead that hes merely a 
mechanic and a prison mechanic at that 
when josh isnt working on cars hes discussing life with mike 
a fellow mechanic heavy metal guitarist and selfstyled 
philosopher you start cleaning yourself a lot better mike 
says about what happens to a man when he has a girlfriend 
suddenly youre buying underwear up the whazoo 
audry hugo adrienne shelly is a doeeyed high school senior 
who spends much of her free time thinking about nuclear war her 
parents want her to go to college but the way audry sees it 
well all be lucky to be alive in september 
josh and audry meet after audrys father gives him a job at his 
local garage josh may be a mass murderer but hes the only who 
knows how to fix a foreign car audry has dumped her nerdy 
boyfriend after he greets her one morning in a jacket and tie and 
she is immediately attracted to josh 
there are of course other complications audrys father 
christopher cooke objects to the relationship offering josh a 
raise in return for leaving her alone and audry unable to get 
josh to sleep with her leaves lindenhurst to pursue a modeling 
career 
hartley shows a nice touch for deadpan humor and as black 
comedy the film works cooke is especially funny ranting and 
fuming like a stressedout ward cleaver ready with a parental 
cliche for all occasions the director also takes full advantage of 
the low budget even switching from one scene to the next by 
showing a flash card that reads meanwhile 
but audrys reflections on nuclear war wear thin and hartleys 
message about emotional capitalism the way relationships are 
conducted like business seems forced 
the film is simply too detached to make anyone really worry 
about the characters achieving emotional truth after all theyll 
be lucky to be alive in september 
the unbelievable truth was produced by hartley and bruce 
weiss with jerome brownstein as executive producer the film is 
rated r for language and adult situations

flatliners 
no flatliners is not a movie about pioneer farmers 
scrabbling for a living on the limitless midwest plains the flat 
line referred to in the title is that oscillograph much used in 
hospital scenes that indicates vital signs when the line goes 
flat the lights are out 
kiefer sutherland is an ambitious medical student obsessed with 
learning what lies beyond the flat line philosophy failed 
religion failed now its up to physical science he propounds 
sutherlands messianic zeal wins over three fellow students 
julia roberts william baldwin and oliver platt a more reluctant 
kevin bacon agrees to go along in an abandoned part of the 
university hospital they rig up a lab dr frankenstein wished hed 
had 
starting with sutherland they wander into the twilight zone 
what they discover is not the stairway to paradise but scary 
reminders of their past transgressions the demons pursue them 
after their return to life 
in less able hands flatliners might be an overwrought 
exercise in science fiction thanks to joel schumachers astute 
direction and ingenious production design the film is a 
heartgrabber 
schumacher cousins has an expert feel for the macabre and 
he makes good use of the vitality of his young cast rarely has the 
look of a film proved so important eugenio zanetti has created a 
world where sunlight rarely enters the gothic murals and sculpture 
of the crumbling hospital full of skulls and death masks provide 
the perfect backdrop for the bizarre goingson 
peter filardis script is brilliantly inventive even if logic 
flies out with ghosts of things past james newton browns music 
contributes inestimably to the somber mood 
although kiefer sutherland is the dominant figure the five 
leading roles are almost equal julia roberts is not merely a 
pretty woman but a convincing actress as well kevin bacon asserts 
his rightful position as a character actor of real strength as the 
girlchasing charmer william baldwin exhibits the star quality of 
his brother alec rotund oliver platt has the best lines as the 
wry conscience of the reckless quintet

chinas first fullfledged stock market since the 
communist takeover will open in shanghai in december a newspaper 
report said monday 
the port city will begin operating a national securities 
exchange in a new building equipped with computer terminals linked 
to trading counters inside the city and around the country 
shanghais official liberation daily reported 
shanghai mayor zhu rongji during a recent visit to the united 
states told the los angeles times that the new exchange would 
first concentrate on government securities and later develop 
trading in shares of shanghai companies 
he said the city planned to lift a ban on foreign purchases of 
shares very soon and to allow foreignowned banks which now 
are restricted to settling foreign currency accounts to handle 
deposits and loans 
shanghai which had one of asias largest stock exchanges before 
the 1949 communist takeover opened a small stock trading counter 
in 1989 for cash purchases and sales as well as resales of 
government bonds 
the exchange which is capitalized at 50 million yuan or 106 
million remains small because most shares rest with enterprises 
and securities houses that rarely trade their holdings

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states dropped by 26 this week to 996 according to a 
widelywatched index of drilling activity released monday 
baker hughes inc the oil toolmaker said that despite the 
plunge the figures remained well above the 870 working rigs a year 
ago last week the number of working rigs was 1022 up 21 from 
the previous week 
baker hughes rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs 
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the 
number of producing wells 
the company has kept track of the rig count since 1940 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states louisiana posted the largest 
decline losing 10 rigs for the week other states reporting losses 
were oklahoma down nine wyoming down seven pennsylvania and 
kansas which each lost three and new mexico and north dakota 
each of which lost one rig 
of states reporting gains for the week colorado had the largest 
increase adding five rigs among other states with gains michigan

the largest gain in five months while personal incomes rose 04 
percent the government said today 
the commerce department said consumer spending totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 364 trillion after being 
unchanged in may it was the biggest advance since a similar 10 
percent increase in january

reported earlier this month that retail sales rose 05 percent in 
june the first increase since last january the department 
reported last week that personal spending fell 03 percent during 
the three months ending june 30 
personal income totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
463 trillion following identical 03 percent gains in april and 
may 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income fell to 49 percent it had been 54 percent in may and 
51 percent in april 
a higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital 
since funds thus would be available domestically for business 
investment 
the report said americans income after taxes increased 05 
percent up from 03 percent a month earlier 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 130 billion after a 101 billion increase in may 
on the spending side the increase in personal consumption 
which includes everything except interest payments on debt rose 
345 billion including 96 billion for durable goods expected to 
last more than three years

january a commerce department spokesman said automobile sales 
accounted for a large share of the gain 
nondurable goods spending rose 82 billion for the first 
advance since february while spending for services advanced 167

subject to change the wall street journal reported citing sources

a total of 25 billion 
the unions need more than 4 billion to complete the cash 
portion of the 201pershare buyout refinance existing debt and 
provide working capital for the airline

the small car market against the best of the japanese 
competition lefauve said 
production is coming on line retail facilities are under 
construction and we cant wait to get to the marketplace this 
fall he said

focus national attention on the cars launch this fall he said it 
also provided a chance for team members to talk with smith 
the public in october will get its first authorized look at the 
saturn line gms first new nameplate since chevrolet joined up in

the french computer firm groupe bull sa announced 
monday plans to cut 3000 jobs during 1990 and said losses for the 
first six months this year were three times larger than in the same 
period in 1989 
the troubled computer maker said in a statement it would lay off 
3000 workers to streamline manufacturing and research operations 
in north america ireland and france 
the stateowned company predicted earlier this year that only 
1200 layoffs would be necessary 
bull said losses from january through june 1990 totaled 188 
billion francs or 355 million up from a loss of 537 million 
francs in the first half of 1989 
the latest loss stemmed in part from bulls acquisition of the 
dataprocessing units of zenith electronic corp last year the 
company said 
consolidated revenue rose to 159 billion francs or 28 
billion in the first half from 140 billion francs in the same 
period in 1989 
bulls loss comes amid a general downturn among 
mainframecomputer makers standardization has cut demand for 
costly proprietary systems and has sliced profit margins for 
companies that havent adapted 
the french concern said earlier this year that it planned to cut 
1200 jobs from its work force to cope with the slowdown and 
changes in the industry 
bull said sales picked up in june after declining for five 
straight months and noted it normally earns about 60 percent of its 
revenue in the second half of the year 
the company posted a loss of 267 million francs in 1989 
following a profit of 303 million francs the previous year

the professor was very hungry for a hamburger 
but then as sometimes happens to professors he reached into his 
pocket and found no money he would have to do without 
he didnt think it was fair just a few minutes before he had 
paid for a doctors visit with a credit card receiving in return a 
bill marked paid in full his health insurance company would 
reimburse him 
he mused if i had hamburger insurance i would not have this 
problem i could have had my hamburger already eaten it without a 
dime in my pocket he thought the idea had promise everyone 
eats hamburgers he thought 
and so with tongue in the cheek where he had hoped to have a 
hamburger he devised a plan to allow all americans in need of a 
patty to have one free and open access to hamburgers a rather 
basic right he mused 
the professor an economist named william dunkelberg who also 
is dean of the school of business and management at temple 
university in philadelphia decided to explore the idea it might 
relieve his craving 
the plan is simple he explained it would work like all 
the other insurance programs we just add up total burger 
expenditures divide by the number of people and arrive at an 
average premium 
any individual who paid this premium perhaps 40 a year would 
receive a walletsize hamburger insurance card the money would go 
into a hamburger insurance trust which would repay the burger 
joint 
as he drove back to the office the notion grew he saw millions 
of people signing up and multimillions of dollars pouring into the 
hamburger trust it would be a whopping success 
then the bills arrived from the hamburger providers and it was 
very clear that the bills exceeded the insurance premiums collected 
how could this be asked trust officials we charged each 
person the average amount spent on hamburgers in the united states 
plus 5 for overhead expenses such as maintaining our respectable 
but by no means posh offices 
congress established the hamburger commission to investigate and 
report it found people who didnt eat hamburgers didnt sign up 
for the program thus revenues were less than projected 
the commission recommended that congress make hamburger 
insurance mandatory so that no one could escape responsibility for 
funding such important coverage some commission members thought 
this was not enough 
why because those who originally signed up for the program 
bought even more hamburgers than they had before they had the 
insurance these heavy eaters not only were buying more hamburgers 
but more expensive ones as well 
a number of beneficiaries were using the insurance card to buy 
burgers for their pets and drivethrough customers were ordering 
an extra burger for the road in case they got hungry they could 
always throw it away 
producers innovated too triple deckers became the norm and 
burgers made of ground filet were especially popular as business 
lunches and among the tennis and garden club set at higher prices 
of course and delivery extra 
the hamburger trust was endangered without insurance many 
people would be unable to afford hamburgers business people warned 
that a failure of the trust would destroy jobs and force small 
companies out of business 
it was decided that a tax subsidy was needed to save the 
program no one declared an heroic cattlestate senator 
should escape responsibility for maintaining this american 
institution 
premiums were raised and made mandatory taxes were raised too 
reducing consumer disposable income and making people more reliant 
on the hamburger program for basic food 
the impact was immediate more expensive hamburgers were 
introduced more companies entered the business and they offered 
more services fully covered by premiums fewer people ate at 
home they couldnt afford to 
the federal budget deficit grew and it was urgently suggested 
by some throwbacks to another time that the program be curtailed to 
save the economy not a chance it was an election year 
at that point the professor dropped the idea as a very dangerous 
one the idea he confessed had lost its appeal quite a contrast 
to his original pride in thinking it up 
he had lost his taste for a hamburger forget it he said 
swallowing his pride instead

continue to be europeanrun icl which currently does 60 percent 
of its business in britain already has said its intention was to 
expand to europe fujitsu intends to support this intention 
naruto said 
for icls part the deal provides the mainframe manufacturer 
with the funds and technology for research and development and for 
its planned thrust in europe 
icls ability to grow will be significantly enhanced as a 
member of the fujitsu family said arthur walsh chairman and 
chief executive officer of stc plc the parent company of icl at a 
london news conference 
fujitsu chairman takuma yamamoto said his company intends to 
seek a separate listing for icl on londons international stock 
exchange as soon as practicable 
under the agreement fujitsu will pay icls parent company stc 
plc 700 million pounds or about 12 billion for an 80 percent 
stake in the british computer firm icl itself will pay stc an 
additional 428 million pounds or about 734 million 
there had been rumors for about a year about a possible equity 
tie between icl and fujitsu which already have technology links 
according to london analysts 
icl uses fujitsus computer chips and disks under a 
nineyearold agreement 
analysts consider icl to be europes most profitable mainframe 
computer maker yet in the first six months of the year the 
company suffered a 74 percent decline in operating profit to 107 
million on sales of 14 billion 
analysts said fujitsu has the financial strength to help icl 
withstand what is expected to be an increasingly competitive 
european market 
we have come to respect icl in the course of our technological 
collaboration in the last nine years and this agreement builds on 
that relationship said yamamoto 
he said icls chairman and managing director peter bonfield 
would continue in that position 
fujitsus major activity in europe is selling semiconductor 
computer chips although it makes office computers in spain and 
semiconductors in ireland

an agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to restrain crude oil production set a positive tone in 
the market energy analysts said

skepticism that opec will achieve its goals 
the accord signed friday by all of the cartels 13 ministers 
raises opecs target price to 21 a barrel from 18 
to achieve its price increase the cartel set a new daily output 
ceiling of 225 million barrels a bit above the current cap but 
lower than its actual production in all opec will have to rein in 
production by about 700000 barrels a day

developing countries of southeast asia deplored 
the lack of progress in international trade negotiations and said 
monday that they feared being left out in the economic cold 
in a strongly worded statement criticising developed nations 
indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand 
saidwe are concerned that deals will be struck among the 
principals in the fall and developing countries will be left out in 
the cold 
there seems to be no point in going further if this is going 
to be the scenario we call on developed countries to show 
leadership in the market access negotiations said the statement 
by the four countries which together with brunei make up the 
association of southeast asian nations known as asean 
stating that the group places special emphasis on market access 
it added asean views progress in this area as the gauge by which 
to measure the seriousness of developed countries in taking 
developing country concerns into account 
the global negotiations are called the uruguay round of trade 
negotiations aimed at better market access and freer trade the 
round is scheduled to conclude in december 
the possibility that the round will end as a failure does 
not seem unthinkable the statement said giving details of how 
the developed nations were attaching conditions for tax concessions 
and quotas for tropical products textiles agricultural and farm 
products and other goods 
the asean nations are attending the ninemonthold asia pacific 
economic cooperation apec meeting here monday and tuesday where 
they differed with the developed nations in discussions on the 
trade talks 
the other members of the 12nation apec are the united states 
japan canada australia new zealand and south korea 
two separate statements were issued on their discussions a mild 
one by apec and a strongly worded one by asean 
asked why there were differences singapores trade minister lee 
hsien loong told a news conference there were differences on 
naunces of views but he said they were united in wanting 
faster progress 
but a senior asean official who spoke on condition he would not 
be identified by name saidof course there are deep differences 
at the rate we are going they will give us nothing or very little 
that is why our views were expressed so strongly 
the apec statement said the trade talks had not made enough 
progress and it was the single most important issue on the 
international agenda 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama asked apec to admit 
china taiwan and hong kong which want to be members but 
conference officials said they doubted they would be admitted here 
although membership was possible later 
malaysian foreign minister abu hassan and others spoke about 
developments in eastern europe and the single european market 
coming in 1992 fears were expressed that international funds might 
be diverted to eastern european development resulting in less aid 
trade and investment for the asiapacific region 
conference officials said singapores foreign minister wong kan 
seng asked for an expert group to be set up to study how this could 
be avoided and how stronger relations with europe could be 
established

copper futures prices fell sharply monday on new yorks 
commodity exchange ending a fourday rally amid speculation that 
london warehouse stocks of the metal have grown 
on other commodity markets precious metals were mixed grains 
and soybeans were mixed energy futures rose and livestock and 
meat futures were mostly higher 
copper futures settled 80 cent to 235 cents lower in new york 
with the contract for delivery in august off 23 cents to 1244 a 
pound 
the copper market had risen strongly in five of the six previous 
sessions including the last four on concerns about relatively 
tight supplies and a strike that began thursday against the 
stateowned peruvian mining and refining company mineroperu 
but the strike was settled over the weekend and analysts believe 
demand for copper may be easing based on indications that 
warehouse stocks documented by the london metal exchange rose in 
the past week the london exchanges report on warehouse stocks was 
due out tuesday 
an early decline of more than 20 points in the dow jones 
industrial average also prompted selling of copper futures on the 
belief that a weakening economy would translate into weaker copper 
demand 
the market recovered though and ended the day with a gain of 
nearly 19 points 
frederick dagostino president of metal resources inc a 
riverside conn dealer in scrap and refined copper said the 
recent runup was not justified by actual supplyanddemand factors 
everything i know everything ive read says the markets 
about 15 cents overpriced dagostino said 
he said market players who are not involved in the physical 
copper trade can sometimes bid prices up to unrealistic levels but 
ultimately supply and demand do determine price 
in precious metal trading on the commodity exchange gold 
futures finished 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher with august at 
36780 a troy ounce silver was 3 cents to 45 cents lower with 
september at 484 a troy ounce 
soybean futures rose moderately on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting strength in the soybean oil market 
wheat futures fell and corn futures were mixed amid slack export 
demand for those grains 
forecasts for continued beneficial crop weather in the midwest 
also weighed on the corn market and limited soybean gains analysts 
said 
after the close the national weather service released a new 
sixto10 day outlook predicting normal temperatures and normal to 
abovenormal rainfall for the midwest during the first half of next 
week 
a 30day forecast predicted abovenormal rainfall for the region 
through august 
also after the close the agriculture department released a 
weekly cropprogress report that showed development of the corn and 
soybean crops still lagging far behind the normal pace 
the slow crop development is a function of heavy spring rains 
that delayed planting fears have begun to surface in the markets 
that some lateplanted crops could suffer frost damage 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with september 
at 294 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
september at 261 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with 
september at 128 a bushel soybeans were cent lower to 6 cents 
higher with august at 588 a bushel 
most energy futures prices climbed on the new york mercantile 
exchange on the back of a bullish opec agreement aimed at boosting 
crude oil prices and cutting the oil glut 
analysts said last weeks agreement by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries to restrain crude oil production set

profittaking and skepticism that opec will achieve its goals 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 34 cents 
higher with september at 2021 a barrel heating oil futures were 
04 cent lower to 51 higher with august at 5693 cents a gallon

the dollar fell broadly against major foreign 
currencies monday continuing a drop prompted by a weakening us 
economy and the prospect of lower interest rates 
gold prices were mixed 
global investors dont think the dollar is very attractive 
right now said earl i johnson a vice president with harris 
trust amp savings bank in chicago 
traders said the dollar closed at its lowest level in more than 
two years against the west german mark and at about a twoyear low 
against the british pound 
chris mendell a vice president with security pacific national 
bank in los angeles said that as differences in global interest 
rates have narrowed rates of return for investors in europe and 
japan have become higher or comparable to those in the united 
states 
mondays market activity was largely a carryover from friday 
when the dollar tumbled in reaction to reports of slow growth in 
june of the gross national product which measures the nations 
total output of goods and services 
the financial markets believe that with the us economy 
continuing to slump the federal reserve will push interest rates 
lower to help stimulate growth 
but such a move would come at the expense of the dollar 
currencies are supported by higher interest rates so a drop in 
us yields makes the dollar less competitive 
the market since the gnp report friday has increased its 
conviction that the dollar will go back down mendell said 
the british pound climbed against the dollar following up on a 
more than 2 cent rise on friday sterling rose to 18465 in new 
york from late fridays 18375 in london earlier the british 
pound rose to 18440 from 18350 late friday

canadian dollars up from 115195 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
friday included 16085 west german marks down from 16145

from 11521 
the dollar fell to 14783 japanese yen in new york from 14910 
late friday in tokyo earlier the dollar tumbled 215 yen to a 
closing 14860 japanese yen and it was quoted in london at 14815 
yen 
gold fell 20 cents on the commodity exchange in new york to 
36780 a troy ounce republic national bank of new york later 
quoted a bid of 36770 up 40 cents from friday

wang laboratories inc reported monday it 
lost 4967 million in the april through june period as the 
computer firm continued to accumulate charges from a restructuring 
that included a 30 percent workforce cut 
the loss which came to 301 per share was more than 30 
percent greater than the 3747 million or 229 a share loss in 
the same period last year revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter 
was 6522 million compared with 7509 million for the same 
period last year 
securities analyst casey stern of the new yorkbased altman 
brenner wasserman and co said monday that wang chairman richard 
w millers drastic moves to restructure the company were paying 
off despite the fourth quarter losses he predicted that the 
company would post a profit in fiscal 1991 on revenues of 25 
billion 
miller had reduced a 575 million bank debt last august to the 
current 30 million and cut about 10000 employees from 29200 to 
19000 
in a statement miller said although this reevaluation has 
resulted in substantial restructuring charges and nonrecurring 
balance sheet adjustment we believe the decisions that have been 
made position the company for future profitability in a changing 
industry 
miller said the restructuring costs stemmed from the continuing 
implementation of operation customer wangs attempt to reorient 
itself to changing markets and new customer needs 
stern said wang had made headway in reducing the bureaucracy 
that had alienated customers 
the company reported a net loss for fiscal 1990 of 7159 
million or 435 per share on revenues of 2497 billion in 
fiscal 1989 the net loss was 4243 million or 259 per share 
on revenues of 2910 billion

unocal corp said monday its secondquarter 
profits rose 38 percent in part because of an aftertax gain from 
the sale of a norwegian subsidiary and higher domestic natural gas 
prices

billion from 307 billion in 1989 the company said 
for the apriljune quarter the energy company earned 165

cents per share in secondquarter 1989 
for the first six months of 1990 unocals net earnings were 
242 million or 103 per share compared with sixmonth 1989 
earnings of 207 million or 88 cents per share 
unocal chairman richard stegemeier said the latest results 
reflected a 132 million aftertax gain from the sale of the 
companys wholly owned norwegian oil and gas subsidiary he also 
cited higher gas prices and production and lower deferred income 
taxes and net interest expense 
sixmonth revenues were 536 billion compared with 570 
billion last year unocal attributed the drop primarily to the 
absence of petroleum product sales by unocals midwest marketing

the dollar opened at 14775 yen down 085 yen from its close 
monday at 14860 yen it fell to 14783 japanese yen in new york 
overnight from 14910 late friday 
the dollar has taken a beating against most major currencies 
since last friday when it tumbled in reaction to the us gross 
national products slow growth in june 
financial markets believe the federal reserve will push interest 
rates lower to help stimulate growth 
but chizuko satsukawa a currency trader with chemical bank in 
tokyo said tuesdays lower opening in tokyo reflected more a 
demand for yen in cross trading with the german mark than any 
inherent weakness in the dollar 
many dealers thought that with the end of the month there 
would be an increased demand for dollars but that seems not to 
have materialized she said 
nevertheless she predicted the dollar would not fall much 
further bottoming out somewhere around 14740 yen 
on the stock market the closely watched nikkei stock average of 
225 selected issues rose 43664 points or 143 percent to

varity is considering a headquarters move to buffalo to make its 
stock more widely available to us investors and to relieve them 
of the canadian governments 15 percent withholding tax on 
dividends company officials say 
but canadian officials have said their government will sue if 
necessary to block the move 
the move would violate a pledge varity then known as 
masseyferguson made in 1986 in return for a 1691 million 
government bailout according to officials of the ontario 
development corp a quasipublic agency that funnels government 
loans to businesses 
the officials say varity agreed to maintain or create 1500 jobs 
in canada by 1993 and also keep its headquarters there 
varity recently purchased a mansion in buffalo and won an 115 
million package of tax exemptions from the erie county industrial 
development agency those actions prompted public warnings from 
canadian officials that varity would face a court fight if it moved 
its headquarters
