the producers of a broadway play about arms 
control negotiations brought their performance to congress on 
monday night where it was viewed by an appreciative audience that 
included the secretary of state and two men involved in such talks 
it bore no resemblance to reality thats what made it so 
good said secretary of state george shultz after viewing a 
walk in the woods it was a good characterization and a lot of 
laughs he said 
the play starring sam waterston as the american negotiator and 
robert prosky as his soviet counterpart was performed in the 
library of congress auditorium across the street from the capitol 
a dozen senators having just finished a day of debate about the 
ussoviet mediumrange arms control treaty were among the 250 
people who attended the play along with shultz paul nitze and 
maynard glitman 
nitze was the american who formed the basis of waterstons 
character while glitman was the chief us negotiator on the 
mediumrange missile treaty 
nitze and glitman agreed with shultz 
it didnt bear any relationship to anything we talked about 
said nitze 
its a dramatization and while its good its not like 
reality said glitman 
the play a black comedy is based on nitzes 1982 private talk 
with yuri kvitsinsky nitzes soviet counterpart that discussion 
produced an agreement between the two men on the framework for a 
mediumrange missile treaty but the plan was later rejected by 
both governments 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee said he thought the production dramatizes the human 
side of what is too often a faceless bureaucracy 
pell was one of the hosts for the play which was performed by 
waterston and prosky on their day off

the medieval fantasy willow a 55 million 
gamble in an oftendisastrous film genre found an audience and box 
office figures monday show moviemaker george lucas apparently has 
another hit on his hands 
willow released early to avoid firstweek competition from 
certain blockbusters crocodile dundee ii and rambo iii was 
the nations topgrossing film in its debut weekend with an 83 
million take 
mgmua chairman lee rich said he was buoyed by the figures and 
was confident willow could maintain its box office appeal 
despite the two surefire sequels that will flood 2000 screens 
each on wednesday 
willow surpassed the opening weekend business of raiders 
of the lost ark 826 million in june 1981 and top gun 
819 million in may 1986 rich said 
in addition to high expectations from star wars creator 
lucas and cocoon director ron howard willow has received 
interest because of the amount of money it cost to make the film 
over a twoyear period 
it also comes after two expensive lucas flops labyrinth 
and howard the duck one willow critic recently called it 
ron howard the duck 
art murphy who monitors box office trends for daily variety 
noted that only five motion pictures in history have ever done 8 
millionplus during mays traditional prememorial day holiday

an 82 million take on 1796 screens 
in third was colors with 29 million followed by 
beetlejuice with 27 million and shakedown in fifth with 
12 million 
in willow the main character lives in a village of little 
people and finds a baby floating in the river but its a special 
baby who will threaten the throne of the evil queen bavmorda 
the queen orders her warriors to find and kill the baby and the 
story revolves around the perilous trek to a castle sanctuary 
willow which opened friday at 1024 theaters nationwide 
with little enthusiasm from reviewers is the latest effort from 
lucas whose star wars and indiana jones films have grossed 
1 billion 
chicago tribune reviewer david kehr said of lucas in 
willow the force has left him hes imitating himself and hes 
moping while he does it 
daily variety termed the film a medieval mishmash but 
predicted kids will probably love it the hollywood reporter

a 19yearold student from thailand who 
studied in pasadena and los angeles was crowned miss universe of 
1988 in a flashy competition on this asian island tuesday morning 
porntip nakhirunkanok a blackhaired bangkok resident won 
250000 in cash and prizes including a sports car and mink coat 
she wiped away tears of joy and joined her hands together in a thai 
sign of thanks after winning 
the first runnerup was miss korea yunjung chang she was 
followed by miss mexico amanda olivares miss japan mizuho 
sakaguchi and miss hong kong pauline yeung sixtysix women had 
competed 
among the 10 semifinalists was miss usa courtney gibbs of 
fort worth texas 
miss nakhirunkanok who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8 
inches tall was educated at pasadena city college and ucla in 
southern california she said during the program that she owed her 
englishspeaking ability to big bird on the sesame street 
childrens program 
organizers of the 37th miss universe pageant estimated 600 
million people in 57 countries watched the televised competition 
for a successor to the 1987 miss universe cecilia bolocco of chile 
the program was filmed at 9 am tuesday 9 pm edt monday 
from a 9000seat sports stadium in a taipei suburb so us viewers 
could watch during prime time monday evening the schedule forced 
the local audience to don tuxedos and evening attire at an hour 
more appropriate for reading the morning newspaper over a bowl of 
cereal 
the live broadcast seen in taiwan was briefly interrupted with a 
bulletin for a civil defense emergency exercise in the central 
island 
missing from this years festivities was longtime host bob 
barker who resigned after last years competition in singapore to 
protest the use of furs he was replaced by television personality 
alan thicke 
beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by taiwans leaders who 
viewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation and 
were dismayed by reports that a miss china winner performed strip 
dances in las vegas 
the island has since emerged as one of asias most prosperous 
countries and authorities lifted the ban last year to clear the 
way for a domestic airline to sponsor the miss universe pageant 
there is lingering opposition from a few groups including retired 
soldiers who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers 
but the telecast generally was seen in taiwan as an opportunity 
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the republic of 
china the official name of taiwan seldom used internationally 
because most countries recognize the rival communist chinese 
government in beijing 
organizers pledged to refer to taiwan as the republic of china 
during the telecast and promised the twohour program would have 
about 30 minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the 
contestants at scenic spots in taiwan 
the miss universe pageant generated much interest in taiwan but 
was pushed into the background friday when the islands most 
violent antigovernment protest in recent years broke out in 
taipei the 18hour street battle between protesters and police 
left more than 200 people injured nearly 100 demonstrators were 
detained 
prizes for the 1988 miss universe include 76000 in cash a 
maserati convertible automobile and a mink coat and mink jacket 
the 11 judges include dick rutan and jeana yeager who made 
history with their roundtheworld flight aboard the voyager two 
years ago and susan ruttan of the television series la law

jack kent is making money and enemies at 
both ends of the 275footlong contraption he runs near this town 
of oil men and shrimp boats 
his hazardous waste kiln at marine shale processors big as a 
football field with a smokestack 140 feet high is a highprofile 
presence on the flat southern louisiana horizon 
its also a target of two groups that want to shut it down some 
local residents who suspect its dangerous and business competitors 
who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations 
marine shale which employs about 240 people denies the claims 
and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators 
in washington as well as louisiana the debate centers on 
whether kents contraption is an incinerator which must meet one 
set of regulations or a recycling plant required to meet others 
kent charges 200 to 300 per 50gallon drum to take in 
hazardous wastes from the companies that make them ranging from 
glues to various petroleum byproducts but excluding pcbs 
dioxins asbestos explosives mercury compounds or 
diseasecarrying materials he receives 720 tons a day 
he heats the waste to about 2500 degrees fahrenheit for 2 
hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an 
elongated cement mixer he sells the resulting aggregate as 
material for road beds and parking lots he has about 10 customers 
so far 
if marine shales claims about its process and product are found 
valid by state and federal officials examining the companys 
operations it could render competitors incinerators obsolete 
while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste 
disposal problem is handled 
it could also be very lucrative for marine shale company 
attorney and vice president george eldredge says a patent is being 
sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will 
follow 
eldredge likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste 
for storage in landfills while marine shale eliminates it in the 
creation of a product 
at marine shale next to bayou boeuf conveyors lift piles of 
various materials some sludgy some solid and some that serve as 
their own fuel into a huge rotating cylinder 
cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln which looks 
like hollywoods vision of hell red hot with glowing embers and 
tumbling debris a computer keeps tabs on temperature gases and 
pressure shutting down the operation if anything goes awry 
according to eldredge 
earlier this year marine shale gave members of congress clear 
plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate 
in the handle the public relations gimmick prompted richard 
fortuna lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors to 
write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the capitols 
safety engineer to arrange for the transportation of this 
material to a permitted facility for proper disposal 
sure we did it acknowledged fortuna director of the 
hazardous waste treatment council he contends the marine shale 
product is dangerous 
kent says envy motivates the treatment council hes charging 
less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste 
and then turns it into a product that sells for 1 a ton 
it makes them sad he says sardonically 
the treatment council has joined south louisianians against 
pollution or slap to fight marine shale 
sally herman head of slap says she opposes marine shale 
because she believes admittedly without evidence that the company 
may be a factor in the areas unsually high cancer rate 
personally i think theyre contributing to it she said 
slap and fortunas group have threatened a federal suit to try 
to halt marine shales operations 
the battle has spread to congress 
sen john breaux dla attacked the company in april in a 
subcommittee hearing suggesting that laws might be needed to close 
loopholes that allow marine shale to operate without an incinerator 
permit 
kent suggested that breaux was acting on behalf of his friend 
bill broadhurst whose law firm has represented rollins 
environmental services inc a treatment council member broadhurst 
is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential 
candidate gary hart on the ship monkey business with donna rice 
breaux spokesman bob mann labeled kents suggestion ridiculous 
the 140foot emissions stack at marine shale puts out a steady 
plume of vapor which the company says is clean water used to 
scrub the gases of particles that might pollute the air is 
reused in the process he said emissions pass through a bag 
house where according to eldredge they are filtered through 
more than a thousand bags resembling vacuum cleaner bags before 
release into the air 
eldredge stressed that none of the water from the marine shale 
process is discharged into the bayou he cited state department of 
environmental quality records showing that traditional 
incinerators such as the one run by rollins in baton rouge 
contaminate scrub water that must be treated before it is 
discharged into the mississippi river a source of drinking water 
for new orleans and other communities 
about 1750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42 
states ship them to marine shale according to spokesman larry 
august the materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely 
put in marine shales kiln he said

43 mile eastbound span of the chesapeake bay bridge 
stollers were met sunday on the west side by gov william donald 
schaefer who kicked off his one million marylanders bay cleanup 
campaign an attempt to get residents to practice water 
conservation and change household disposal habits 
the bay bridge walk which began at 9 am and was completed by 
530 pm drew 15000 more people this year than last years 
record in part because sunday was one of the first warm weekend 
days in what has been a rainy cool spring

we have a pretty good idea what remarkable 
images americans will see during the upcoming moscow summit reagan 
toasted in the kremlin embracing dissidents and bolsheviks 
chatting with christian monks talking shop with russian filmmakers 
not to mention nancy at the monument to the defenders in 
leningrad 
to capture this presidential tour de force there will be more 
american tv technicians in moscow than spies and diplomats 
combined what with the eighthour time difference reagan 
appearances will be beamed back to the united states in plenty of 
time for morning newscasts 
breakfast at wimbledon this will be breakfast at the hall of 
facets 
but what about the soviet people what will gostelradio the 
soviet radioandtelevision monopoly show of the summit will 
reagan and the refuseniks lead off vremya the evening news 
already soviet tv has taped a interview with reagan for 
broadcast on friday but it was a simple talking head session 
30 minutes of questionandanswer with none of the adventure or 
significance of next weeks reagan tours around moscow 
american experts believe soviet television will broadcast 
excerpts from the presidents address at moscow university in the 
lenin hills as well as ceremonial exchanges between reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in the kremlin if there are 
agreements to be signed the klieg lights will be set up in 
vladimirs hall 
and surely there will be footage from the bolshoi where the 
gorbachevs host the reagans for a 90minute ballet sampler 
but will soviet officials air highlights from the danilov 
monastery where reagan will discuss religious freedom with monks 
who work restoring orthodox icons how much will be broadcast from 
reagans dialogue on artistic freedom with soviet intellectuals at 
the union of writers club 
and what of the first ladys visit to leningrad will she be 
shown touring the hermitage much as raisa gorbachev was shown on 
american tv touring the smithsonian galleries 
just what images will glasnost permit will soviet television 
let reagan be reagan 
itll be very interesting to see what they show on television 
the week before the summit former ambassador arthur hartman said 
last week wondering whether gostelradio will show the bum on the 
grate 
soviet tv loves to broadcast pictures of hapless vagabonds 
reduced to sleeping on the heat grates near the white house its a 
sad and pathetic side of the american dream and many viewers of 
soviet tv probably have come to believe its an accurate snapshot 
of life in america 
but certainly something is afoot on the gostelradio side of 
glasnost just last week soviet tv viewers got a glance of michael 
jacksons pepsi performance a glimpse of a visa card and a sales 
pitch for the quality of sony tvs 
never mind that you cant get a sony tv in the ussr 
commercials for pepsi visa and sony were aired last week in the 
midst of a fivepart soviet series on life in the united states 
estimated audience 120 million people 
i expect we might get some angry letters from people saying 
why are you advertising sony tvs when we cant buy any tv 
personality vladimir posner said at a news conference announcing 
his series to hear him tell it the decision to air the 
commercials was less glasnost than perestroika the gorbachev 
campaign for economic reform 
we on our part can make some money out of this which in our 
day and age when we are becoming economically selfsupportive and 
selfsufficient also makes sense posner said reports in the 
united states said the soviet broadcast agency gostelradio received 
10000 for each 30second ad 
profit motive thats the american way

the soviet decision to withdraw troops from 
afghanistan is more than a lifesaving step it has rescued mikhail 
gorbachev from another leavetheafghansalone lecture from 
president reagan 
as the leaders prepare for their fourth summit in moscow may 
29june 2 the first red army units have come home to uzbekistan 
and the soviets seem determined to meet a february 1989 deadline 
for the removal of all 115000 troops 
the erasure of afghanistan as the topmost regional issue at the 
summit will give reagan more time to push gorbachev toward 
settlements in other global hot spots cambodia southern africa 
the middle east and central america 
at least for now there has been a resolution or at least the 
formula for resolving the afghan issue said michael h armacost 
undersecretary of state for political affairs and head of the us 
team preparing for the summit discussion of regional issues 
at the summit there just isnt that much more to say to them 
except perhaps thanks and keep up the good work said 
another state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
this official and armacost as well suggested however that 
afghan issues could reemerge as a summit topic because the united 
states and the soviet union are still actively engaged in the 
settlement process as the soviets wind down their eightyear war 
in terms of military arrangements one of our biggest concerns 
is that they take out whatever minefields they have sown over the 
past eight years the state department official said this is 
an issue of safety for civilians coming back to their villages 
earlier this year before the soviets signed a pledge to 
withdraw their troops the united states beseeched moscow to take 
the further step of ceasing military assistance to the government 
headed by afghan leader najib 
in return the united states said it would stop giving military 
support to the mujahadeen the antisoviet resistance fighters 
matching soviet restraint with us restraint 
moscow rejected the proposal and on may 14 the soviet military 
commander in afghanistan announced he would leave behind up to 1 
billion in arms and installations for use by the afghan army 
that doesnt strike me as a demonstration of tremendous 
restraint armacost said he reiterated the us determination to 
keep helping the guerrillas and said bluntly well have 
practical ways of accomplishing that purpose 
asked if gorbachev might seek reagans help in getting the 
resistance to let the russian troops retreat home without being 
harried by attacks armacost said the soviets would do better by 
seeking local arrangements with mujahadeen leaders 
though these issues remain the fundamental decision to withdraw 
and evidence last week that the agreement is being carried out 
removed an irritant that has nagged ussoviet relations since 
december 1979 when red army forces entered what had been a civil 
war 
president carter protested the invasion by keeping the us 
olympic team home from the 1980 moscow games and he embargoed grain 
sales to the soviets 
reagan resumed the grain deals but he made clear that better 
ussoviet relations hinged to a large extent on moscows 
willingness to pull its troops home from the afghan conflict 
indeed before his met gorbachev in geneva in 1985 in reykjavik 
in 1986 and in washington in 1987 he devoted speeches to the issue 
and signaled his intention to berate the soviet leader about 
afghanistan when they met 
for example in a speech to the heritage foundation eight days 
before the washington summit reagan said its time for them to 
pack up pull out and go home its time that they set a date 
certain for the complete withdrawal of all soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
reagan said it appeared that even the soviets were writing off 
the current regime in kabul the soviets pride themselves on 
recognizing objective reality well its time for them to bite the 
bullet 
by contrast two weeks before the moscow summit the white house 
found itself praising soviet actions calling the pullout a 
welcome first step

when the government threatened 
to close the weekly mail the newspaper responded in typically 
irreverent fashion it printed a ratfaced caricature of the 
government minister who issued the warning 
since its birth in 1985 the weekly mail has been a combative 
government opponent winning staunch friends and making plenty of 
enemies but never losing its sense of humor 
its aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary have 
earned it the nickname the weekly wail and many consider it 
the bestwritten newspaper in south africa 
the newspaper has a circulation of only 22000 and most of the 
readers are welloff white liberals its prominent backers range 
from us sen paul simon dill to the royal dutch shell oil 
co which places a fullpage ad in each issue supporting press 
freedom or urging political reform 
three years ago we felt the tradition of aggressive critical 
newspapers was being lost said coeditor anton harber our 
role has been to pursue indepth coverage of the townships and 
politics and take a more strident stance against censorship 
the government repeatedly has attacked the weekly mail as part 
of the alternative media that fans revolution and promotes 
outlawed organizations such as the african national congress the 
largest guerrilla group fighting south africas whiteled 
government 
home affairs minister stoffel botha has complained about 
numerous articles in the weekly mail issued two official warnings 
against the newspaper and threatened to close it for three months 
botha already has suspended two newspapers aimed at south 
africas black majority new nation and south the weekly mail is 
one of five more papers that have received warnings 
botha warned us that our wailing threatens public 
safety the weekly mail said in an editorial on its front page 
we deny the charge our newspaper kicks at consciences and tears 
down barriers it does not throw bombs 
dont let us go quietly carry on reading us carry on 
subscribing make a fuss wail dammit the editorial said 
despite threats of closure the newspaper continues to pursue 
controversial stories critical of the government and its system of 
apartheid which prohibits blacks from having a voice in national 
affairs 
recent articles have challenged government casualty figures for 
south africans fighting the marxist government in angolas civil 
war suggested south african agents were behind the killings of 
african national congress officials abroad examined the african 
national congress in a report from the groups headquarters in 
lusaka zambia and provided a detailed account of a black activist 
who allegedly was kidnapped and assaulted by the army 
weve managed to put issues on the agenda that werent being 
covered by the larger papers said harber 
while the newspaper focuses on serious political issues it 
regularly finds room for lighter matters it is the only south 
african newspaper to run the american comic strip doonesbury and 
it has lively culture and sports sections often written with an 
acid wit 
brian mitchell the world boxing association juniorlightweight 
champion who must fight abroad to have his bouts officially 
sanctioned is described by the paper as south africas only 
diplomat with clout 
after a white south african sprinter ran 100 meters in 1006 
seconds newspapers and the staterun television network checked 
the record books and proclaimed him the worlds fourth fastest 
white man 
a weekly mail columnist responded my next sporting goal is to 
become the seventhfastest graybearded pinkfreckled lefteyed 
sexagenarian tannedbutwhite hurdler over four meters glory 
beckons 
when a south american field hockey team competed in south africa 
as a mystery team to avoid criticism for boycottbusting other 
newspapers protected its anonymity 
but the weekly mails staffer attended a game and reported that 
knowledgable fans were preoccupied with the weather repeatedly 
saying chilly 
business day the countrys leading financial daily describes 
the weekly mails political coverage as stylish sophisticated 
frequently clever and aimed at an elite market 
the weekly paper posed no threat to public safety because it is 
aimed at the gentlest least violent most anxious guiltridden 
sweetly intentioned middle class a business day editorial said 
botha and his advisers have neither the general education

a new state law allowing students to choose 
their schools will improve education proponents say but some 
educators fear the plan could hurt smaller schools and bring 
unhealthy competition 
we realize there may be some poor choicemaking in the free 
market but the challenge is to educate parents in how to make 
sound choices says nan skelton assistant state education 
commissioner 
the measure gives minnesota the nations broadest open 
enrollment plan skelton said schools may refuse students only if 
the transfer would interfere with desegregation ratios in 
minneapolis st paul and duluth or if the school is too crowded 
state funding about 3000 per youngster follows the student 
to the new district previously parents had to pay tuition to the 
new district 
gov rudy perpich signed the measure into law may 6 it takes 
effect in the 198990 school year in larger districts and applies 
statewide in 199091 
state education officials hope schools will improve their 
programs in the competition to attract students a 1986 national 
governors association project recommended open enrollment as a way 
to boost school quality 
i have mixed feelings said jeff keller an assistant to the 
superintendent of the 89student humboldtst vincent school 
district one of the states smallest if theyre put on the 
honor system are they going to transfer for the right reasons 
a champion debate coach worries about students transferring for 
nonacademic reasons 
for some students those activities are a very important part 
of what theyre about said randy keillor of st francis high 
school whose teams have won three state titles in six years and 
one national title 
but keillor says he sees the value of such plans 
if the concept is to allow parents and students some choice 
you have to recognize thats important for them keillor said 
students could transfer to schools where their chances of making 
an athletic team might be better or to join friends but its 
debatable whether those are poor reasons to switch skelton said 
its just who gets to judge she said the people who get 
to make the decisions are the parents and the students if the 
education department thinks its a frivolous reason it doesnt 
matter 
mary kay frisch of st paul who lives on the border between two 
districts took advantage of a forerunner of the law and sent her 
two children to a different district so they could be with their 
friends 
they just love going to school if they children arent 
happy being at a school they arent happy doing anything there 
mrs frisch said 
the minnesota school boards association opposes allowing 
students to transfer for nonacademic reasons 
i dont think students should be permitted to exchange 
districts for athletic reasons or for some personality reasons it 
seems to me that really could cause some chaos or problems said 
executive director willard baker whose association represents 435 
districts 
the minnesota federation of teachers which represents 20000 
teachers has not taken a position 
theres a possibility that small districts could end up losing 
students said sandra peterson federation president they may 
have to look at cooperative ventures with other districts or 
consolidation 
minnesota began open enrollment on a voluntary basis this school 
year with 137 students in 95 districts choosing to participate 
under the voluntary program districts had the option of accepting 
transfers from outside their districts 
for the 198889 school year 435 students in 153 districts 
applied said kenneth zastrow director of support services for the 
state education department 
us department of education officials have applauded 
minnesotas efforts 
the overwhelming majority will not make decisions like these 
for frivolous reasons said mitchell pearlstein spokesman for 
the departments office of educational research and improvement 
indeed most students will not change school districts but 
choice is valuable even when people decide to stay where they are 
keillor said he hopes the new law will prompt more schools to 
offer debate programs but worries about the effect of transfers on 
his own program 
if we had even four students transfer into our school and they 
were good that would lock up all positions so kids from st 
francis would not have a shot keillor said 
on the other hand keillor said if open enrollment provides a 
marketplace for education then shoot thats going to get more 
schools looking at adding this program

on madison avenue it would be called an image 
makeover 
in the kremlin the shifts and realignments in soviet foreign 
policy over the past three years have been labeled new thinking 
the change in appearance of soviet diplomacy has boosted 
communist party chief mikhail s gorbachevs standing in the world 
and improved the atmosphere at international meetings 
stonyfaced officials have been replaced by smiling congenial 
diplomats such as foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
communist party foreign affairs secretary anatoly f dobrynin 
a more active schedule of foreign visits has distinguished 
gorbachevs tenure and soviet officials have emulated their 
leaders more open approach by giving news conferences and social 
events at home and during trips abroad 
the smoother style has done much to break down the wall of 
mystery that has surrounded the soviet union since the 1917 
bolshevik revolution that gave birth to the worlds first socialist 
state 
but in gorbachevs rebuilding of relations with countries in 
regions as diverse as the middle east western europe central 
america and asia many of the pieces of kremlin foreign policy have 
fallen into familiar places 
gorbachev coined the new thinking phrase in speeches during 
his first months as party general secretary calling on his 
nations policymakers to take a fresh look at soviet relations and 
activity around the world 
the foreign policy mosaic evident three years after gorbachev 
assumed power shows some advances broadened influence and 
stagnation 
the most dramatic achievements have been the start of soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan agreed to after eight years of 
fighting and five years of negotiation and the signing last dec 8 
of an agreement with the united states to eliminate mediumrange 
nuclear missiles the first treaty to scrap an entire class of 
nuclear weapons 
gorbachev and other senior soviets have claimed the inf 
agreement was a result of kremlin flexibility and perseverance 
toward fulfilling their goal of a nuclearfree world by the year 
2000 a disarmament plan set out in a speech by the leader in 
january 1986 
president reagan on the other hand attributes it to the white 
house policy of dealing with the soviets from a position of 
strength 
despite the rhetoric and conflicting claims of responsibility 
the movement on arms control has encouraged observers to believe 
that new thinking has moved from idea to action in some 
instances although the outcome remains mixed and at times 
contradictory 
relations with the united states have surpassed the detente era 
of the 1970s when the superpowers policy of mutual tolerance 
produced a shortlived warm spot in the postwar chill peace 
friendship and educational exchange groups arrive daily to build 
bridges between soviet and american citizens 
but the leaders continue to regard each other as adversaries 
west germany france england and other major european powers 
have shared in the warmth of better ties between the superpowers 
and progress toward nuclear arms control yet the societies of east 
and west retain sharp differences including their definitions of 
personal freedom and fundamental human rights 
while soviet soldiers are leaving the war in afghanistan the 
kremlins support for nicaragua angola and cambodia remains a 
point of contention between the superpowers it also suggests that 
the kremlins historic practice of spreading socialist revolution 
remains a goal 
the kremlins reforms have spread in part to eastern europe 
where the soviet bloc to some degree have been able to choose 
their own course of development with that comes more 
responsibility for their own economic performance and less reliance 
on moscow for support 
soviet influence have seen the least change in the troubled 
mideast region where the arabisraeli conflict still draws a sharp 
line between the superpowers and neither has succeeded in defusing 
the iraniraq war 
the kremlin has given its relations with libya a lower public 
profile and tried to gain some influence with iran in hopes of 
resolving the 8yearold gulf war however the soviets still have 
no diplomatic ties with israel and is viewed as too closely aligned 
with some arab countries to broker a peace accord in the middle 
east 
the kremlin has continued to make restoration of diplomatic ties 
with israel contingent on the jewish states departure from arab 
territories occupied after the 1967 mideast war however an 
exchange of visits by consular delegations was permitted last year 
and a sharp rise in jewish emigration from soviet union have to 
some degree improved the sovietisraeli relationship

bob duntley has traded in his ties and 
starched shirts casual dress will do these days when instead of 
calling customers from his comfortable office he stands in line to 
make his pitch on a pay phone 
its like fighting with one arm tied behind your back said 
duntley 55 as he scanned a legal pad filled with names of 
potential buyers around the country for ameristate corps 7500 
steelcutting equipment 
actually its like throwing your money down the drain 
it is the hassle created by the great phone outage 
it began may 8 when a fire damaged virtually all the vital 
hardware at an illinois bell co switching station 
at first the outage seemed only a minor inconvenience for 
customers in a handful of du page county communities about 30 miles 
west of chicago but as bell crews examined the smoldering cables 
and waterdamaged electronics the picture became much clearer 
and very bleak 
phones for 35000 customers were dead indefinitely silencing 
the simple crosstown call or the longdistance business deal 
limited local service has since been restored but calls outside 
the immediate area are hit or miss 
to offset the lack of phone service towns increased police 
patrols for several days public employees also sat in vehicles on 
street corners watching for crime or fire or medical emergencies 
there have been no reports of any law enforcement or fire 
problems linked to the outage however 
illinois bell crews are working around the clock to replace the 
wrecked equipment but the job may take until june 
its total confusion its been a disaster said joan 
schramm an officer of the hinsdale chamber of commerce 
hinsdale with 16700 residents is one of the largest 
communities affected but there is little industry here with its 
cozy colonialstyle downtown shops and centuryold homes the 
village is a soothing retreat from the hectic pace of chicago 
but to the south in oak brook burr ridge and willowbrook 
industrial parks sprawl along interstate 55 some of the countrys 
biggest corporate names are here including mcdonalds corp which 
employs 1500 people at its headquarters 
calls to downtown chicago have been tricky said mcdonalds 
spokeswoman lana e ehrsam if one finally gets through we might 
pass the phone around despite the fire we are able to keep 
operating we were never totally without anything 
weve been using a lot of resources she added faxing and 
telexing all over 
its driving me crazy said dirk tweed a salesman for 
outdoor sports headquarters inc in willowbrook at first i 
thought it was funny you know hey the phones dont work now i 
guess its pretty serious 
i still run my regular route to stores that want hunting and 
fishing stuff but i really cant tell what they might need if i 
dont have a phone tweed said heck i cant even call my boss 
in dayton ohio 
he said he spends much of his time reading magazines and talking 
to two secretaries 
how are we coping this is how were coping says vicki 
riendeau chewing a candy bar with her legs up on the desk if 
this keeps up ill be a raving lunatic weve looked at the files 
and already rearranged what we rearranged last week what else is 
there 
among the hardest hit are 24000 florists nationwide that belong 
to ftd inc the flower delivery network 
about half are hooked to a computer system in downers grove 
designed to relay an order across the country in a snap but the 
line to the ftd computer network flows through the hinsdale station 
weve been absolutely crippled said bob poirier director 
of operations for ftd subsidiary floral network inc who has the 
task of trying to find an alternative system 
the flower business has not stopped people can still call 
and order but instead of using the computer network florists have 
to look up florists in other cities and call them one by one that 
hurts 
the switching station meanwhile has come to resemble a 
traveling circus 
big mess tents are erected for the dozens of laborers assigned 
to get the site back in order and illinois bell executives call 
the shots from a row of trailers customers line up at a bank of 
portable pay phones trucked in by the utility 
its been a disaster but its folksy said nancy ging a 
local psychotherapist referring to the small talk between people 
waiting to use the phones 
there are pluses as well as minuses she said one plus is 
people have to be resourceful most people dont know how strong 
they are how they can get along im impressed with how well 
people have been coping

mikhail s gorbachev said a ussoviet treaty 
reducing longrange nuclear weapons could be signed by january but 
that he will not set aside disputes over the star wars program 
to reach such an accord 
the soviet leader also said his policy of glasnost or 
openness includes freedom of speech but he condemned a leading 
dissident as a parasite and accused him of sponging on the 
democratic process 
gorbachevs comments came in a presummit interview with two 
american news organizations the soviet news agency tass on sunday 
ran a partial transcript of the interview with the washington post 
and newsweek 
radio moscows englishlanguage foreign service also carried a 
report about it as its lead item on sunday soviet televisions 
widely watched evening news program vremya mentioned as its 
lead item that the interview had been published in washington and 
would appear in todays soviet newspapers 
the 90minute discussion in which gorbachev also proposed a 
joint ussoviet trip to mars covered a wide range of foreign and 
domestic issues 
the interview conducted in the kremlin on wednesday produced a 
startling biblical reference by the head of the officially 
atheistic state 
when asked about how far glasnost should go and about criticism 
of dictator josef v stalin the 57yearold communist party leader 
said 
jesus christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how 
to feed 20000 jews with five loaves of bread we dont possess 
that skill we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems 
quickly 
the interview was conducted 11 days before president reagans 
arrival in moscow for a fiveday summit with gorbachev it will be 
their fourth meeting 
although the tass transcript included much of the interview it 
deleted a reference to yegor ligachev the kremlins no 2 man it 
also left out a reference to gorbachevs wife raisa 
ligachev considered more conservative than the soviet leader 
reportedly wants to slow gorbachevs policy of perestroika or 
restructuring of the soviet economy and society 
gorbachev acknowledged a lively debate between the two but said 
to present these discussions which are a normal part of the 
democratic process as division within the leadership would be a 
great mistake itself 
gorbachev expressed optimism that a superpower agreement to cut 
strategic or longrange nuclear weapons will be completed by the 
time reagan leaves office in january we want to have that 
signed he said 
if the agreement comes to be drafted under the present us 
administration i see no reason why president reagan and i should 
not sign it i would certainly welcome that gorbachev added 
however he cautioned that he has no plans to set aside disputes 
to hasten an agreement if we sign with one hand a treaty 
reducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the same 
time launch an arms race in space or at sea what would be the 
point that would be senseless he said 
he reiterated his opposition to reagans star wars missile 
defense program known as the strategic defense initiative saying 
the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms race in space 
is committing a crime against the people his own people and 
others 
us and soviet officials have said they dont believe the 
longrange nuclear weapons treaty will be completed by the end of 
reagans term 
another treaty to ban short and mediumrange nuclear weapons is 
being debated by the us senate 
gorbachev said he will ask reagan at the summit to approve a 
joint sovietus unmanned flight to mars why shouldnt we work 
together we have great experience you have great experience let 
us cooperate to master the cosmos to fulfill big programs he 
said 
on domestic affairs gorbachev was asked whether glasnost 
includes freedom of speech while freedom of speech is 
indispensable for glasnost we see glasnost as a broader 
phenomenon he said 
glasnost is the right of every citizen to openly say what he 
or she thinks about all social and political questions he added 
gorbachev was asked later whether freedom of speech applies to 
dissidents such as moscow journalist sergei grigoryants who was 
jailed for a week earlier this month gorbachev said soviets think 
of grigoryants as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society 
sponging on the democratic process 
gorbachev went on to call grigoryants a parasite it was a 
rare reference by a soviet leader to a dissident 
grigoryants editor of the dissident magazine glasnost said the 
computer and printer used to produce the journal were confiscated 
when he was arrested 
in a telephone interview on sunday he called gorbachevs 
comments about him very unpleasant

for years rep delbert latta groomed 
his son to replace him when he retired from congress but another 
wellknown ohio republican had a different idea about who will go 
to washington 
after the elder latta announced in january he would not seek 
reelection it seemed only natural that robert latta would declare 
his candidacy for ohios 5th district 
but the lattas didnt count on a challenge from within the 
challenge came from republican paul gillmor who had irritated the 
lattas just enough to prompt murmurs of a feud 
gillmor was the highest ranking gop legislator in the state and 
candidate for his partys nomination for governor in 1986 
official vote totals from the may 3 congressional primary show 
gillmor defeated latta by 41 votes of more than 63000 cast in a 
threeway race but a recount is automatic because of the slim 
margin 28680 to 28639 and even the ohio secretary of state 
says the race is too close to call 
i dont think it divided the republicans because i ran a 
positive race gillmor 49 said last week i said before the 
primary race that i would support the eventual nominee i expect 
they would do the same 
robert latta has refused to concede but the 32yearold 
corporate attorney from bowling green said he will support gillmor 
if gillmor is the nominee 
as a republican for my entire life you support republicans 
he said 
hoping to pick up the pieces is democrat thomas murray a 
51yearold sandusky attorney making his second run for congress 
murray believes the departure of the elder latta will end gop 
domination in the bowling green district which now boasts more 
registered democrats than republicans 
nobody believed i could beat del latta in 1986 and they were 
right it was like running against an institution murray said 
theres no doubt that he has the contacts in the district from 30 
years of service but im not sure the same can be said for any of 
the republicans this time 
michael marsh chairman of the wood county republican party 
said murray may be chasing moonbeams 
i think the gop primary had the potential to be a real nasty 
kind of thing but basically i think the candidates did a good job 
of talking about themselves rather than each other he said 
i think it makes it easier to put together a campaign in the 
fall for the winner i just dont see people flocking to vote 
for thomas murray 
marsh said a rift occurred between gillmor and delbert latta in 
1982 when the legislature was redrawing congressional district 
lines at the time gillmor was president of the ohio senate a 
position he still holds 
marsh said gillmor was trying to redraw the 9th congressional 
district a traditional democratic stronghold that includes toledo 
so it would be more favorable for edward weber a republican 
elected in 1980 
to accomplish that gillmor wanted to take away one county and 
part of another from lattas district and place it in the 9th 
district marsh said he also wanted to move lattas district east 
latta opposed gillmors plan marsh said 
eventually lattas district moved a bit east and lost parts of 
wood and fulton counties the 9th district gained a part of a 
democratic stronghold 
the result weber lost in 1982 and the 9th district under 
democratic rep marcy kaptur is once again democratic territory 
later gillmor found himself shut out of some gop functions in 
northwestern ohio for example he discovered he was an outsider 
during president reagans visit to bowling green in 1984 
they have a dais in a hall and have 50 people up there 
lattas neighbors are up there but the president of the ohio 
senate is sitting out in the crowd said one republican official 
who spoke on the condition his name not be used 
the elder latta 67 son of a barber is serving his 15th term 
in congress he is senior republican member of the house budget 
committee and a veteran member of the house rules committee

new regulations to reshape the farmers home 
administrations loan policies will cost 87 billion and push as 
many as 64800 farmers into liquidation or foreclosure the agency 
says 
the fmha an agency of the agriculture department is scheduled 
to open the proposed changes to public comment this week a summary 
of the agencys proposal was made available to the associated press 
cheryl cook a lobbyist and lawyer for the national farmers 
union said she had not had an opportunity to study the fmhas 
proposal in detail but indicated that the figures cited by the 
agency appeared to be in line with estimates 
if they had used the authority that they had gotten in the 
1985 farm law to restructure this debt we wouldnt be in a 
situation now where it was too late for 64800 people she said 
the fmha is often called the governments farm lender of last 
resort because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify at 
banks or other commercial sources overall the agencys farm loan 
portfolio totals around 26 billion to 250000 borrowers 
with loan delinquencies rising fmha was directed by congress in 
last years agricultural credit act to rewrite many of its 
regulations so that borrowers would be given a greater opportunity 
to restructure or spread out payments and still hold onto their 
land 
in many cases debts far beyond the ability of farmers to repay 
would be written down to manageable levels or forgiven 
entirely many other regulatory changes also were ordered by the 
new law 
basically the writedown would reduce a farmers fmha debt to 
the level of his assets depending upon his ability to operate with 
enough cash flow thereafter to repay the new loan balance 
the proposed regulations are scheduled for publication this week 
in the federal register the governments official rulemaking 
document and will be open for public comment for 30 days 
in its summary the fmha said about 118000 borrowers were 
delinquent or in some other default status in early 1988 those 
included 16000 borrowers who have been accelerated by the 
agency a process that leads to forced liquidation or foreclosure 
for hopeless cases 
but the agency estimated that about 37000 of the 118000 
delinquents will be able to resolve repayment problems through 
normal servicing procedures such as the rescheduling of loan 
installments and other alternatives 
the remaining 81000 borrowers would be eligible for 
consideration of restructuring with writedown of debt the 
report said based on an earlier survey of borrowers eligible to 
restructuring with writedown of debt an estimated 20 percent 
16200 of the 81000 borrowers are able to show repayment on 
remaining debt and qualify for the writedown 
it added about twothirds of the borrowers are unable to show 
repayment ability on remaining debt and would be rejected for 
writedown the remaining potential writedown borrowers would not 
be considered for writedown because their debt was less than the 
estimated recovery value 
the report included a brief profile of borrowers in the survey 
who qualified for fmha debt writedown 
a large proportion of their total debt was with fmha 
the fmha loans were greatly undersecured or there was no 
net value in the security for fmha which mean that a large 
percentage or all of their fmha debt would be subject to 
writedown 
a substantial portion of the borrowers income was from 
offfarm jobs 
costs of writing down fmha debt for the estimated 16200 
qualified borrowers were estimated at a net of 21 billion 
the agency said that its federal budget authority may be 
dramatically affected by the revised servicing procedures as loan 
losses will tend to be recognized up front as the writedowns are 
incurred instead of after the liquidation and delayed settlement of 
the debts 
requested reimbursement of agency funding for losses may be 
increased from about 1 billion in fiscal year 1989 to a 
substantial share of the total estimated writedown and loan losses 
of 87 billion in fiscal year 1990 the fmha said

the verdict in the trial of a 
maryland nurse accused of killing hospital patients with a common 
substance used for a variety of medical procedures will influence 
how all nurses go about their jobs a spokeswoman for a nurses 
organization says 
jane bolding formerly a nurse at the prince georges hospital 
center about 20 miles east of the nations capital is accused of 
killing three of her intensive care patients by injecting them with 
lethal doses of potassium and attempting to murder two others the 
same way 
potassium is found naturally in the body but in large amounts 
can cause cardiac arrest 
a guilty verdict would likely have a chilling effect on 
health care officials who routinely prescribe and administer common 
medicines like sodium bicarbonate and insulin which can be fatal 
if used in large quantities said carol grimaldi a spokeswoman for 
the american nurses association based in kansas city mo 
such a verdict would make it more difficult for people to 
carry on in an already stressful environment she said 
we usually see cases where people are accused of murder by 
turning off machines or poisoning not the use of an organic 
compound she said the 180000member association represents 
registered nurses 
autopsies on the three victims all revealed inexplicably high 
levels of potassium but no official cause of death was ever listed 
in any of the cases and no one witnessed bolding doing anything 
wrong 
if bolding is convicted of murder the case could have 
ramifications for the nations health care industry according to 
defense attorney burt kahn 
if this case went unchallenged there would be paranoia 
throughout the medical industry kahn said this case is a 
medical and legal nightmare 
what makes the case so important is that potassium an 
electrolyte found in the body is also used for a variety of common 
medical purposes in hospitals kahn said 
assistant states attorney jay creech has called bolding a 
killer angel he is basing his case on a study by the federal 
centers for disease control that indicates more of boldings 
patients died of cardiac arrest than did those of any other nurse 
at the hospital 
on the first day of trial in prince georges county circuit 
court last wednesday defense attorneys scoffed at the cdc report 
and said the prosecutions case is based on the flimsiest of 
circumstantial evidence 
on thursday boldings attorneys got the pathologist for the 
intensive care unit of the hospital where the nurse worked to say 
that potassium levels normally begin to rise as soon as a patient 
dies 
dr ivan matei said that once the heart stops and oxygen 
ceases to flow in the bloodstream tissues and cells begin to 
break down releasing storedup potassium 
its a normal process matei told the court 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in which a strenuous chest 
massage is used in efforts to restart the heart also causes tissue 
breakdown matei testified in addition kidney failure contributes 
to high potassium rates because the bloodstream which caries 
potassium is not purified matei added 
cpr was attempted on all three patients bolding is accused of 
killing and at least one had kidney problems hospital records 
indicate 
we say its impossible to tell whether potassium caused the 
heart attacks or whether the heart attacks resulted in high levels 
of potassium kahn said this whole case is about doubt 
the investigation of bolding runs from january 1984 to march 
1985 but kahn introduced into the court record documents 
indicating high potassium levels for patients at the hospital 
during a 10year period that encompasses the bolding probe 
creech has relied on hospital records in an attempt to establish 
that bolding was present when the patients died but hospital 
officials testified under cross examination that many others also 
had access to the alleged victims 
none of boldings former colleagues who have testified so far 
have questioned the nurses work ethic or job performance 
bolding was indicted after a grand jury heard testimony last 
year on the cdc study the nonjury trial is expected to last up to 
eight weeks

the worlds biggest meat eaters are curbing 
their appetites for beef and looking for second helpings of poultry 
and pork 
per capita meat consumption in the major producing countries 
usually the richest grew about 11 percent over the last decade 
says an agriculture department report but the gains werent across 
the board 
for instance most of the increase came from poultry and pork 
while beef declined the report said consumption of lamb 
mutton and goat stagnated worldwide 
in 197577 americans averaged about 127 pounds of beef and 
veal 59 pounds of pork 2 pounds of lamb mutton and goat and 51 
pounds of poultry 
by 198587 per capita consumption was beef and veal 106 
pounds pork 63 lamb mutton and goat 2 and poultry 73 those 
are carcass weight equivalents before being divided and trimmed 
into retail cuts 
even in argentina the biggest meateater of all per capita 
beef consumption dropped to 174 pounds from 187 a decade earlier 
declines also occurred for lamb mutton and goat meat and poultry 
each down 1 pound 
however the soviet union which has been striving to upgrade 
diets boosted beef consumption to 62 pounds per capita from 52 
pounds in 197577 while pork increased to 48 pounds from 43 lamb 
mutton and goat held steady at 3 pounds but poultry consumption 
jumped to 23 pounds from 14 pounds previously 
the report was included by the departments economic research 
service in the agencys quarterly national food review issued last 
week 
analysts noted that per capita meat consumption is affected by 
many factors including local and world economies religion social 
customs and even climate 
most meat is produced and consumed in highincome countries 
the report said however new technologies like improved 
refrigeration and transportation in developing countries have 
opened the door for meat imports and improved the distribution of 
such products 
on the other hand religion sometimes restricts the kinds of 
meats that are acceptable in certain countries moslems and jews 
shun pork and hindus avoid all meat 
pork is the predominant meat in europe especially eastern 
europe as well as in china japan and other asian nations in 
china alone where about a third of the worlds pork is produced 
consumption rose to about 35 pounds from 18 pounds during the 
decade the report said 
poultry consumption has gained the most reflecting the 
relatively brief time span and less feed required to produce a 
pound of poultry meat compared with other grainfed livestock 
beef consumption predominates in north and south america and 
in australia and new zealand where an abundance of forage is 
available for ruminant livestock production the report said 
ruminants like cattle sheep and goats can be raised without any 
grain but this requires reliable sources of cheap forage

despite sharp differences over agricultural 
policy and subsidies the 12nation european economic community 
remains the leading market for us farm products 
in calendar 1987 according to the agriculture department 
exports of farm products to the eec were worth 68 billion up by 
more than 3 percent from 1986 although sales to the european bloc 
and farm exports generally for that matter have not recovered 
to their record levels of the early 1980s usda analysts say 
further growth can be expected 
but eec leaders frostily reject a us proposal made in 
negotiations under auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade to phase out all tradedistorting farm subsidies by the end 
of the century 
willy de clercq the eecs top trade official said in paris 
last week at a meeting of trade ministers that the trade bloc would 
never agree to the elimination of such subsidies although it 
favors unspecified reductions 
according to a recent analysis by the departments economic 
research service us farm exports to the eec this year could rise 
by an additional 5 percent because of attractive us prices 
favorable exchange rates and continued economic growth in the eec 
countries

britains chief rabbi has approved the 
demolition of hong kongs 86yearold synagogue to make way for a 
complex containing a new synagogue and highrise apartments a 
local jewish leader said 
the plan to demolish the ohel leah synagogue split the local 
jewish community and enraged preservationists who see the project 
as another blow to this british colonys heritage 
however supporters argued that the ohel leah synagogue is 
dangerously old and better facilities are needed for a growing 
jewish community 
the chief rabbi of the united kingdom and the commonweath lord 
immanuel jakobovits waived any religious objection to 
demolishing the ohel leah synagogue said robert dorfman a 
synagogue leader

to sheila holladay oregon legislators all 
but voted to end her 2yearold sons life by cutting off funds 
that would have paid for a bone marrow transplant 
so she left southern oregon this spring to seek welfare funds 
for a transplant operation in washington where her son david is 
awaiting a transplant at that states expense 
i left my home i left my dog i left my life holladay 
said this was extremely frustrating because we had a home there 
we had school there we had our lives set up there 
her supporters in oregon raised about 5000 of the 100000 
needed 
oregon lawmakers voted last summer to finance only cornea and 
kidney transplants joining a minority of states that dont pay for 
transplant operations such as those of hearts bone marrow and 
livers 
the move drew little notice until 7yearold coby howard of 
portland died dec 2 of leukemia as his relatives were raising 
private contributions for a marrow transplant 
the resulting furor helped persuade the legislative emergency 
board which handles budget matters between sessions to take up 
the issue but the board voted against using emergency funds to 
reverse the legislatures action 
as a compromise the panel created whats believed to be the 
nations first transplant payment program to be financed by a 
combination of federal funds and private donations 
the program is triggered when 85000 in donations are turned 
over to the state 
some backers of restoring state financing said the compromise 
was better than nothing others were critical 
i really think it was a spineless decision on the part of the 
state said tammi howard cobys mother 
howard is leading a petition drive to put a measure requiring 
the state to resume transplant financing on novembers ballot 
the fact that the state stood by and let a little boy die like 
that has stirred up a lot of emotions she said if it was up 
to the public all of these people would have transplants and would 
be on the road to recovery by now 
susan mcgee cobys aunt deplored a process in which she coaxed 
the boy to perform for television in his final days in attempts to 
raise money 
i asked him to smile for the camera when not 30 minutes 
before he had been vomiting due to his illness mcgee said i 
had to turn coby howard into a marketable product so the public 
would in essence buy him his life 
relatives and friends had raised about 70000 toward the cost 
of the operation by the time he died 
fortyone states pay for bone marrow transplants 36 pay for 
heart transplants and about 40 finance liver transplants said 
jeane thorne director of the state transplant program 
oregon spent about 500000 toward 19 heart pancreas marrow 
and liver transplants in the twoyear budget period that ended last 
june 30 
federal medicaid funds pay 62 percent of the cost of transplants 
for qualified recipients thorne had projected the growth in demand 
for transplants would push the states cost to about 800000 this 
year 
senate president john kitzhaber a physician and cochair of the 
emergency board opposes renewed state financing for transplants 
he says limited health care dollars must be spent in a way that 
will do the most good 
that standard favors funding prenatal care for many lowincome 
women instead of financing costly and sometimes risky operations 
for a few people he said 
we cannot keep people alive forever that is a part of life 
kitzhaber said at one meeting what we can do with our limited 
money is to try to reduce the number of deaths to save as many 
people as we can save 
rep tom mason who hopes to restore state funds said the 
publicity has disgraced oregon 
the national image that this controversy has brought to the 
state is horrendous mason said 
how many more people actually have to die he asked at the 
boards first meeting on restoring the funds 
theres no logic to spend money on prenatal care and then let 
them die after theyre born mason said

congress has provided for a stateoftheart 
civilian air and sea force to hunt down drug boats and planes even 
as lawmakers try to draft a reluctant pentagon to lead the fight 
against narcotics smugglers 
customs service and coast guard patrols use some of the nations 
most sophisticated radars patrol boats and aircraft customs has 
helicopters with bust teams that swoop down on drug planes as 
soon as they touch down 
the customs air wing now has 87 aircraft 37 of them with the 
sophisticated equipment or speed to spot a suspicious aircraft 
track it on radar pursue it and move in for the kill with army 
blackhawk helicopters 
a p3 turboprop surveillance plane to be delivered to customs 
next month will have hightech radar with a full 360degree range 
customs has four other p3s with sophisticated radar systems 
customs also operates four tethered radar balloons called 
aerostats and has four on order for the nations southwest border 
from texas to california currently the most porous area in air 
coverage against drug smugglers 
the coast guard uses much of its 245cutter fleet for drug 
missions and also has new fast patrol boats 16 in service and 
21 on order the agency also utilizes three fast boats that skim 
the water similar to hovercraft two e2c surveillance planes 
which are the navy version of the air forces awacs and 22 
longrange c130 turboprop surveillance aircraft nine twinengine 
falcon jets are being refitted with interceptor radar 
the coast guard also operates an aerostat with another four on 
the way and flies helicopters for bahamian law enforcement teams 
fighting drug smugglers 
to ensure sophisticated communications coordinated radar 
coverage and uptothe minute intelligence the federal government 
is building three command control communications and intelligence 
centers in the miami area oklahoma city and at march air force 
base in riverside calif 
despite this formidable buildup agency officials and lawmakers 
agree that it hasnt stopped drugs from pouring into the united 
states 
congress is trying to even the playing field with legislation 
that would require more help from a military that has been wary of 
draining its resources and reluctant to take on a civilian law 
enforcement role 
both houses have passed legislation by wide margins to force the 
pentagon to do more notwithstanding the 16288 hours the military 
says it flew in support of drug law enforcement in 1987 
final language will be worked out in a housesenate conference 
on the defense department budget authorization bill 
the civilian buildup while significant has been anything but 
steady 
the coast guard operating and acquisition budget for the drug 
war grew just from 509 million in fiscal 1984 to a high of 557 
million in fiscal 1987 
but the figure for fiscal 1988 is down to 514 million and has 
forced a 55 percent cutback in hours devoted to drug patrols 
the drug people have to know our vessels are at the dock and 
planes are not flying said vice adm james irwin of the coast 
guard seizures are down 
his agency is waiting for congress to pass a 60 million 
supplemental appropriation so that full patrols can resume 
the customs air wing has had better luck with a budget that 
grew from 648 million in fiscal 1984 to 163 million in fiscal 
1988 
but sen dennis deconcini dariz and rep glenn english 
dokla said they often fought bitterly with the military to equip 
the air wing 
we went through holy hell said deconcini who heads the 
appropriations subcommittee that oversees the customs service 
budget 
english is chairman of a house government operations 
subcommittee that has continuously reviewed progress on the drug 
war once his staff prepared a chart showing that the number of 
military drug enforcement missions rose every time he held a 
hearing on military cooperation and then dropped off until the 
next hearing 
he once found that navy e2cs that were listed as flying 
antidrug missions on certain dates never left their base 
and deconcini said that the pentagon only gave customs a 
halfdozen beechcraft twinengine turboprops after congress agreed 
to buy a like number of new models for the military which used 
the planes in part to ferry topranking officers

james hooley has planned presidential travel 
to most of the 50 states and 18 foreign countries including the 
economic summits in tokyo and venice but president reagans trip 
to the soviet union this week was different 
preliminary preparations for the moscow summit began in 1985 
after reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev met in geneva 
and said they wanted to visit each others country 
its a whole different mind set hooley director of 
presidential advance said of the soviets they dont deal with 
the kind of things we deal with 
we are constantly pushing and urging and prodding for things 
that are just sort of anathema to their system 
for instance there was the matter of the private dinner reagan 
and gorbachev are having at a country home outside moscow 
the soviets insisted there be no press coverage hooley 
reluctantly agreed but said there should at least be an official 
photographer the soviets said no 
i cant seem to get them to grasp the concept that this is an 
incredibly historic thing or potentially historic these guys 
eating dinner out there in this house in the country hooley said 
in a recent interview it would be like having a picture of 
roosevelt and stalin 
they just dont think like that you really sense that 
instinctively theres a pullback from anything thats going to be 
other than exactly like how they do it and how theyve done it for 
years and years and thats of course very closed 
hooley believes however that gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness does seem to be having some effect 
theres a bit more than i expected of a willingness to let us 
work directly with some of the people at the places where we 
are going he said for example he said the advance team was 
able to work directly with the management of the house of writers 
which reagan will be visiting 
he added i dont think we were turned down from seeing 
anything that we requested to see 
on the other hand you run into this kind of block with no 
explanation on certain issues as to why once you are there in 
these places you cant do certain things the security people can 
override everybody else and they dont feel a need to explain 
the reason 
hooley said the initial preparations for the summit consisted 
mainly of checking with people who had been involved in moscow 
visits before including some members of the nixon administration 
more active preparations began after the two superpower leaders 
met in washington in december and announced that reagan would visit 
moscow sometime in the spring 
over a period of approximately two months leading up to the 
summit three advance teams visited moscow one more than usual 
for a domestic trip as when the president goes to chicago or 
new london conn one person from the advance offices makes the 
initial survey checking out proposed speech sites with an eye to 
establishing communications security and the other facilities 
needed for a presidential visit 
on a foreign trip this group is increased to about 10 or l2 
senior people who get a few concepts agreed to in consultation 
with their counterparts from the host country hooley said 
the final advance team whether the president is going to 
baltimore or bali is a larger group of maybe 45 to 50 including 
technical people to make specific arrangements 
in the case of the summit hooley director of communications 
thomas c griscom and jack courtemanche first lady nancy reagans 
chief of staff made an extra visit to negotiate the finer points 
of the schedule the advance official said 
the ambiguous phrase used by people who had been to the 
soviet union suddenly became clear hooley said theyd say 
its just different from working here

secretary of state george p shultz says 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for a joint mission 
to mars has to be studied carefully and may be taken up under a 
ussoviet space agreement 
thats something thats been talked about but its a long way 
from being agreed upon shultz said appearing on abctvs this 
week with david brinkley 
gorbachev in an interview with the washington post and newsweek 
published sunday said he would ask president reagan to approve a 
joint unmanned flight to mars when they meet in moscow for their 
may 29june 2 summit 
asked if the united states would pursue such a venture shultz 
noted the superpowers reached an agreement on space ventures about 
a year ago under which particular projects are examined 
i presume this will come up under that heading shultz said 
sunday adding obviously this has to be studied carefully we 
always have to be careful with problems of technology transfer 
nasas samuel w keller said sunday he had told soviets 
scientists 10 days ago about a us decision in principle to take 
soviet marsprobe equipment along on a us space launch in 1992 
keller the space agencys deputy associate administrator for 
space sciences told the washington post that under the us offer 
the unmanned us mars observer spacecraft would carry a soviet 
receiver if the us craft still were operating when a 1994 soviet 
spacecraft seeks to land on mars the soviet receiver would improve 
transmissions to moscow he said 
the secretary of state also urged the senate to approve the 
ussoviet treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles in time 
for the summit 
it helps certainly to have completed something and to register 
that fact its good to register the fact that we can do it 
shultz said 
the secretary sidestepping any criticism of the presidents 
conservative allies who oppose the treaty lauded the senate for 
its thorough consideration of the pact 
i think the process has gone well i have only compliments for 
the senate and the way in which theyve handled this he said 
adding i think theres been a time for hearings a time for 
questions a time for critiques and a time for debate there also 
has to come a time to decide and i think were about there 
the pact formally known as the treaty on intermediaterange 
nuclear forces was signed by the two leaders at their december 
summit in washington 
both the president and administration officials are eager to 
have the ratified treaty as a boost for negotiations with the 
soviet side 
the senate has turned aside a wave of amendments designed by its 
conservative opponents to kill the treaty and debate is expected 
to continue through much of the week approval of the pact requires 
67 votes if all 100 senators are present 
the secretary of state also echoed the positive remarks 
gorbachev made in the interview with us reporters in which the 
soviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing in 
half the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons before 
reagan leaves office 
its certainly possible shultz said of prospects for such a 
treaty and i feel certain that at the moscow summit we will both 
want to agree to keep working on it hard but whether it will 
actually happen or not i dont know the issues are tough 
queried about talks on the disputed strategic defense 
initiative which has hampered agreement on a strategic missile 
pact shultz said reagan has staunchly opposed any impediment to 
the development of a defense against ballistic missiles 
that still leaves room for a lot of things the secretary 
said

some of the 4700 firestone inc employees in 
six states who had been on strike returned to work late sunday 
after negotiators reached tentative agreement with the united 
rubber workers on a new contract 
union spokesman curt brown said ratification votes on the 
threeyear contract would be held this week at firestone offices 
and plants in akron noblesville ind des moines iowa decatur 
ill russellville ark and oklahoma city 
workers at decatur russellville and nobelsville plants started 
to return to work sunday night workers in akron were expected to 
be back on the job tuesday morning 
the urw members struck may 15 after firestone declined to accept 
the costofliving allowance provided in an industry pattern 
agreement the union negotiated with goodyear tire amp rubber co 
brown said the new contract followed the goodyear pattern 
reached may 17 
our major goal had been to keep pattern bargaining and that 
had been all we really asked from firestone brown said this 
isnt really a greedy contract 
firestone spokesman robert troyer said we believe this is a 
fair and realistic contract for our employees the agreement 
recognizes the particular needs of firestones tire operation 
he said the company was optimistic for early ratification of the 
contract 
under the agreement firestone would 
maintain costofliving allowances in each year with a 
onecent hourly increase for every increase of 026 in the consumer 
price index 
boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from 
future costofliving adjustments in increments of 10 10 and 5 
cents 
increase retirement pensions for current workers by 350 to 
2350 per month for each year of service in addition current 
retirees would receive a lump sum bonus of 200 before dec 1 
provide choice of firstdollar health insurance coverage or an 
8020 percent copayment plan that includes a 1000 enrollment 
incentive bonus 
make 35 percent matching contributions in the employee savings 
plan that is part of the 8020 comprehensive health plan both 
plans provide for a 401k savings plan 
in addition the pact assures continuation of the contract if a 
firestone plant is sold to another company during the next three 
years and contains a nostrike wage reopener clause in the third 
year 
negotiations resumed saturday at 115 pm with the assistance 
of federal mediator david thorley and an agreement was reached at 5 
am it was the only session held since the strike began may 15 
the strike was the first involving firestone since 1976 when 
the urw struck all the akronbased rubber companies except general 
tire 
in a related development the union said a contract covering 
15000 goodyear workers was ratified sunday when local 2 in akron 
which represents 1700 members overwhelmingly approved the 
agreement 
brown said seven of eleven locals at goodyear had voted on the 
contract six locals representing a total of 8060 members had 
approved it and one with 231 members rejected it 
ratification had been assured friday when a urw local in 
danville va voted by 72 percent to 28 percent to accept the 
pact it was the second goodyear proposal to be put to a vote 
urw members at three other goodyear locals also were scheduled 
to vote sunday they had approved the inital contract proposal 
under the urw constitution contracts must be approved by a 
majority of union locals representing a majority of members

the black vote which has gone almost 
unanimously to jesse jackson so far is becoming more of a wild 
card as michael dukakis tightens his grip on the democratic 
nomination and both parties look ahead to the fall election 
new jersey which holds its primary june 7 along with 
california montana and new mexico to finish out the democratic 
primary season is a case in point 
blacks make up about 10 percent of the states 37 million 
registered voters and dukakis who has worked hard to avoid 
alienating jacksons supporters is hoping to claim a share of the 
black voting bloc in the primary a share he hopes will increase 
dramatically in november 
george bush assured of the republican nomination also has the 
fall contest in mind as he woos the states blacks gov thomas 
kean a bush backer has shown strong support among blacks and the 
vice president is hoping that will translate into some votes for 
him 
dukakis is heavily favored to win the new jersey democratic 
primary perhaps with 70 percent or more of the democratic vote 
jacksons strength appears to be concentrated in highly urban areas 
the closest contests democrats say will be in about half a 
dozen socalled delegate districts where voters will elect a 
total of 71 delegates pledged to one of the two candidates 
such skirmishes of course are small in comparison to the 
battle that looms in november pollster lou harris says he believes 
blacks could effectively pick the next president 
a strong turnout by blacks traditionally democratic by an 
overwhelming margin could break a bushdukakis tie harris said 
race will be a frontandcenter issue harris told a new 
york forum last week on the black vote 
jackson supporters in new jersey say their drive to register new 
voters for the primary might pay off for the democrats in the state 
in november helping win back support captured by kean in 1985 
party leaders also are working hard to head off tension between 
the dukakis and jackson camps while competition in advance of the 
primary has been healthy it has not been nasty 
the candidates themselves met amiably a week ago at the partys 
state convention in south orange 
state democratic chairman ray durkin says he believes black 
voters will return to the democratic fold despite going heavily 
for a republican candidate three years ago 
they were for tom kean durkin says they werent for the 
republican party i think were getting them back 
newark mayor sharpe james chairman of jacksons new jersey 
campaign says he believes both democrats and republicans have 
become wiser as a result of jacksons pioneering candidacy 
on both sides theres a learning taking place he said 
blacks he said are no longer just a voting bloc but a political 
force 
were growing of age said james

here are excerpts of the facetoface 
interview conducted wednesday between soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and senior executives and editors of the washington post 
and newsweek and written answers to questions submitted to 
gorbachev in march 
the excerpts are taken from the transcript which was prepared by 
the post from the original english and russian language used during 
the interview the excerpts from the written questions and answers 
are taken from the english language text supplied by the soviet 
government 
qkatharine graham chairman of the board of the washington 
post co well we are aware that you are following many things in 
particular events in our country and that you read a lot and 
remember everything laughter 
a well someone recommended me very well to you i must extend 
to you mrs gorbachevs warmest regards 
q thank you we had such a nice meeting in washington i was 
hoping perhaps to be able to see her here but if not please give 
her my best regards 
a she is not an easily manageable person laughter 
q they say that about all of us 
a there is an interesting phrase i think of friedrich 
engels he used to say that a woman is an entire civilization 
q looking ahead to the party conference wed like your 
personal reaction to a number of specific proposals for example 
do you support the idea of fixed terms of office for party leaders 
and if so would that include the position of general secretary 
itself 
a well youll hear the answers in the coming days to all such 
questions but i would say one word yes 
q we hope youll say a little more than one word laughter 
a well let me anticipate what you are going to read in the 
papers in five or six days the washington post wants to find out 
earlier 
q this is newsweek 
a your empire then wants to know things earlier 
q our empire is competitive within itself also like all 
empires 
q the interest in the party conference is so great could you 
not perhaps even in more general terms discuss your hopes for 
this meeting which is obviously such an important event 
a i certainly think that my expectations coincide with the 
expectations of our whole society first of all we want to take 
stock of what has happened over these three years to sort out the 
history of perestroika and of course we want that analysis of 
this period to be a critical one we want to draw lessons perhaps 
that will be necessary and based on that analysis we may have to 
take some corrective measures in what we are doing in perestroika 
but i think that the central question is the question of how to 
deepen this process how to move forward with perestroika and make 
it irreversible therefore the main questions at the conference 
will relate to deepening the economic reform and to deepening the 
democraticization of our party and society this is the main thing 
as for the rest of it i think you will find out more 
q soviet editors have told us that mr yegor ligachev 
endorsed the article in sovyetskaya rossiya that had some praise 
for the stalin era you personally endorsed an editorial in pravda 
that refuted the sovyetskaya rossiya article can you tell us if 
the sovyetskaya rossiya article reflected mr ligachevs views 
this second reference to the sovyetskaya rossiya article and 
ligachev was dropped apparently inadvertently when the 
interpreter put this question to gorbachev in russian and does 
this exchange suggest that there is a serious difference of opinion 
in the leadership about how far glasnost should go and the view of 
the stalin era itself 
a well my impression is that this whole theme of deep 
divisions in the soviet leadership as to perestroika as to the 
prospects of perestroika and the evaluation of the past is being 
pushed not by soviet editors but by the western media thats my 
first reaction 
i dont know the motives behind the fact that this is 
systematically tossed up and is then broadcast by various 
voices foreign radio stations in russian and other languages 
into our country 
the current leadership of the soviet union including the 
politburo and the government was formed basically after april 
1985 when we set out on the course of perestroika and all our 
leaders both our political leaders and government leaders are 
committed to perestroika and are actively involved in designing and 
implementing perestroika

when such huge undertakings as perestroika take place when we 
need to develop not only the strategy but also the tactics of 
moving forward that requires not only active dialogue in the 
leadership but in the whole society and that is what has been 
happening the whole country is now an enormous debating society 
and it is natural that in the leadership itself there is lively 
and constant discussion within the framework of perestroika seeking 
answers to those questions that have been put on the agenda by us 
jesus christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how to 
feed 20000 jews with five loaves of bread we dont possess that 
skill we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems 
quickly we together with our society are seeking answers to all 
questions and this is accompanied by discussions and sometimes by 
heated debate and that is normal our problem has been that for 
many years there was no such debate in the society in the party 
not in the central committee not in the government itself or in 
the politburo this absence of debate led to many losses mistakes 
and omissions 
to present these discussions which are a normal part of the 
democratic process as division within the leadership would be a 
great mistake itself maybe some people want there to be 
disagreement even want the leadership to quarrel and to be split 
but thats something quite different that has no connection to the 
actual characteristics of the leadership in our country 
q in your very interesting written answers to us you called 
freedom of speech indispensable yet some soviet citizens still 
get into trouble with the authorities for what looks to us like 
attempts to exercise freedom of speech paruir arikyan in armenia 
and sergei grigoryants in moscow editors of a new unofficial 
magazine called glasnost are recent examples is this because some 
of your authorities dont get the new thinking or is this 
because that sort of the things that those people have done is not 
something you consider expression of freedom of speech 
a the most interesting things that perestroika has 
demonstrated is that our people while being firmly in favor of the 
renewal of society and of change have firmly expressed the view 
that changes could happen only within the boundaries of socialism 
and on the basis of socialist values 
even advances in the economic sphere like cooperatives cost 
accountability leasing and individual enterprise all of this is 
being discussed seriously even scrupulously in our society 
people ask is this not a retreat from the principles of 
socialism some ask if we are undermining the principles of 
socialism and that is because 90 percent of the people living 
today in the soviet union were born and have been raised under 
socialism and the present leadership only wants to try to develop 
this socialist system which opened the way for us in all spheres of 
life we know socialism we know its achievements and its problems 
and we are going to work within the boundaries of the socialism we 
have chosen 
that is why everything that evokes in people anxiety that 
someone has tossed up other values including in the ideological 
sphere this evokes a critical reaction that is also the 
democratic process democracy is like that 
people here know that the grigoryants organization is tied 
not only organizationally but also financially to the west that 
his constant visitors and guests are western correspondents 
therefore people think of him as some kind of alien phenomenon in 
our society sponging on the democratic process sponging on the 
positive aspects of perestroika 
this happens it happens in nature too there are such 
parasites living off healthy organisms and attempting to harm them 
 
i have said that perestroika is a kind of melting pot that will 
make our society stronger that will reveal its democratic human 
potential all in the interest of man and that which some suggest 
that we look for our future in different values and liquidate 
socialist property etc our people reject this will not be 
accepted it is an illusion and you must know this

q in your written answers you say that you would welcome 
another meeting with mr reagan to sign an agreement on a 50 
percent reduction in strategic offensive weapons is this agreement 
on a 50 percent reduction so important and so close to completion 
now that it could be signed while negotiations on space defenses 
and on other problems such as sealaunched cruise missiles continue 
a well we are very much and fundamentally committed to 
decisive reductions in nuclear arms and therefore we want to see 
the agreement on 50 percent reductions in strategic offensive 
forces we want to have that signed in our assessment we have 
covered together a long road in the search for conclusions to all 
questions but i think you would agree with me that if i say that 
if we sign with one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive 
forces in one area and at the same time launch an arms race in 
space or at sea what would be the point that would be senseless 
if we just replace one kind of arms race with another 
particularly in space where the arms race would take a 
particularly dramatic turn we would undermine the trust that has 
begun to be built we would make worthless all the experience that 
we have accumulated at the geneva negotiations this new kind of 
arms race new sphere for an arms race new criteria it would 
take decades to reach some kind of agreement and come to an 
agreement 
i think that he who pushes for an arms race in space is 
committing a crime against the people his own people and others 
that must be said with all responsibility and with clarity such 
an approach such an idea is a road to destabilization to 
unpredictability on matters of security this must be condemned 
the initiator of such an approach must be pilloried 
and sealaunched cruise missiles this would also be a 
roundabout maneuver that could become a new avenue for the arms 
race and therefore we are linking all those questions together 
and we believe that this is a fair approach what is more i have 
to say that we see genuine possibilities to resolve all those 
questions to resolve all of them together and to have a treaty on 
a 50 percent reduction of strategic offensive arms and then to 
continue farther

q the reason behind my question is that there has been movement 
on both sides toward agreement i thought perhaps that theres been 
enough movement on the question of sdi strategic defense 
initiative and that now the washington declaration at the 
december summit could perhaps serve to come to the final great 
problem on sdi which is the difference over what happens at 
the end of the adherence period does the washington declaration 
solve the conflict over what happens at the end of the adherence 
period 
a i believe that which is contained in the statement on the 
understanding of the abm antiballistic missile treaty in the 
form that was accepted in 1972 and as we understood it until 1983 
that does provide a basis to move forward toward 50 percent 
reductions in strategic offensive arms but only in that way in no 
other 
i havent answered the other part of your question we will work 
with any american administration on this important aspect of 
sovietamerican relations i have in mind the process of 
negotations in the context of the geneva talks to find a way to 
agree on a new treaty to reduce nuclear arms if that happens 
during the reagan administration we would welcome that if that 
happens after the election with the new president then so be it 
we are ready to work we dont want to waste any time we are 
prepared to continue it is up to the united states side now 
gorbachev rose from his desk at this point and moved to a shelf 
to retrieve a model of a soviet rocket we are going to invite the 
president and i would like to say in conclusion to cooperate on 
a flight to mars here is a model of that rocket these are 
pictures of the launching of that rocket pointing to color 
photographs on the wall of his office sent to me from the 
cosmodrome in baikonur which i visited last year the rocket last 
year lifted 100 tons into orbit after certain modernizations it 
will be able to carry 200 tons now we are lifting 20 tons 
why shouldnt we try to work together we have great experience 
you have great experience let us cooperate to master the cosmos 
to fulfill big programs and whatever is being done in outer space 
and whatever is being done in sdi to achieve new technological 
breakthroughs as a result of a joint project to study halleys 
comet we have been able to develop dozens of new materials we 
have been able to make major advances in electronics and in 
mathematics this resulted really in major scientific 
breakthroughs this is a field for cooperation that would be worthy 
of the soviet and american peoples and i will make that proposal 
to president reagan

here are excerpts of the written questions and answers in their 
written response the soviets revised some of the questions where 
the questions differ significantly parts of the original questions 
submitted by the post appear in parenthesis 
q have the three meetings with president reagan changed your 
ideas as to how peaceful cooperation competition between 
capitalist and socialist countries should be regulated in the 
future how do you think the forthcoming summit will contribute to 
stabilizing that competition 
a i am convinced that positive trends are unfolding in the 
world there is a turn from confrontation to coexistence the winds 
of the cold war are being replaced by the winds of hope and i see 
that a significant role in that process is being played by the 
signs of improvement in the relations between the united states and 
the soviet union all over the world there is an acute need for 
change or if you wish a need for restructuring international 
relations in that situation it is essential to continue positive 
contacts between the east and the west 
as for the potential results of the upcoming fourth meeting with 
the president and notably the prospects for a detailed agreement 
on a 50 percent cut in strategic offensive weapons the past few 
months and weeks have seen so much speculation that i would like to 
make the following point be patient the meeting is just a few 
days away let the president and i work together whatever we 
arrive at will certainly not be concealed from the public 
if an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive 
weapons comes to be drafted under the present us administration 
i see no reason why president reagan and i should not sign it i 
would certainly welcome that 
q many people in the west think that nuclear weapons have been 
instrumental in maintaining stability in the world over the past 
few decades would it not be more rational for the ussr and the 
us in those conditions to agree on preserving minimal nuclear 
deterrents 
a i cannot agree with those who think that the drive for a 
nuclearfree world is hopeless 
i have argued more than once with representatives of the west 
over their case that without nuclear weapons we would never have 
survived for 40 years without another world war this is just a 
conjecture but what about a sober evaluation of the real role 
played by the socalled balance of fear it has given us 
nothing but unheardof militarization of foreign policies 
economies and even intellectual life it has caused damage in the 
sphere of international morality and ethics and has killed the 
atmosphere of mutual trust friendliness and sincere interest in 
each other which was born in sovietamerican relations in the years 
of joint warfare and victory over fascism 
i am convinced that strategic military parity can be maintained 
at a low level and without nuclear weapons we have clearly 
formulated our choice to stop then reverse the arms race 
as for the socalled minimal nuclear deterrence i will not 
argue now with the proponents of that idea so far you and we have 
more than 10000 warheads each in our strategic arsenals let us 
first cut them by 50 percent maybe then by another 50 percent and 
then once again in the meantime let us come to terms on the 
elimination of chemical weapons and start reducing conventional 
armaments in europe that process should be open not only for the 
us and the ussr but for all other nuclear and nonnuclear 
states that will be an important incentive for the 
demilitarization of politics ways of thinking and international 
relations in general 
q the nato leaders have announced that even with a balance in 
the conventional forces if a parity of conventional forces were 
achieved in europe nuclear weapons will still need to be 
preserved on the continent as a means of retaliation would still 
be needed in europe to pose an unacceptable risk for an aggressor 
if in keeping with that position nuclear disarmament is 
unacceptable for the west should we not try to reach a joint 
agreement on the terms of modernization of the tactical nuclear 
weapons deployed in europe 
a the talk about nuclear weapons on the continent as a means of 
retaliation is the same old concept of a limited nuclear war in 
europe it absolutely contradicts what i conferred with the us 
president about back in genevanotably that nuclear war cannot be 
won and simply must not be allowed to happen 
we support the ideas of nuclearfree zones in northern europe 
and in the balkans we are also in favor of a 300kilometer 
corridor free of all nuclear and any other heavy weapons in central 
europe i am naming just some ideas but certainly not all

q nato suggested cutting tens of thousands of nonnuclear 
weapons that could be used for surprise or largescale offensive 
operations does this approach fall within the boundaries of your 
stated willingness to negotiate on the basis of asymmetrical 
reductions 
a on our side there are no obstacles to that as for the 
existing asymmetries in the arsenals of nato and the warsaw treaty 
i have already expressed my views on that score many times 
asymmetries exist on both sides we stand for the elimination of 
asymmetry on the basis of reciprocity for example the warsaw 
treaty armies have more tanks and the nato armies have more attack 
planes the soviet union and our allies are ready to eliminate 
these and other asymmetries without delay but let me repeat on 
the basis of reciprocity and then it would be possible to balance 
armaments on the lowest possible level sufficient only for defense 
 
we are not satisfied with the pace of the vienna consultations 
of the 23 countries elaborating the objective and format of the 
future conference if the work in vienna proceeds in the same 
onagain offagain manner europe will have to wait for a long 
time for those asymmetries to be eliminated 
q in the months remaining of the reagan presidency what is 
required to broaden your personal relationship with the president 
into an institutional relationship and carry both into the future 
a the experience of presentday international relations shows 
the paramount importance of meetings between leaders of states all 
the more so when the case in point is the united states and the 
soviet union since both countries are well aware of the need for 
intensifying the dialogue and improving relations it is absolutely 
obvious that it is not only the leaders personal views that 
matter this is the imperative of our time this is the striving of 
our peoples such is the constant in the sovietamerican dialogue 
we are interested in developing the dialogue we will strive to 
make it more productive we will try to facilitate the 
adaptation of the next us administration to contacts with us 
and will do everything within our power to keep the process begun 
in geneva in 1985 from stopping and naturally enough we hope for 
the same attitude on the american side 
q do you feel president reagan is a different kind of american 
leader 
a im not particularly fond of giving personal character 
references but since you ask i would like to say that realism is 
an important quality in president reagan as a politician by this i 
mean the ability to adapt ones views to the changing situation 
while remaining faithful to ones convictions 
q the americans are familiar with the rapid erosion that 
occurred in the situation in vietnam once they decided to withdraw 
from that war how does the soviet union propose to avoid such an 
erosion now that the outline of the withdrawal from afghanistan has 
been drawn if attacks on soviet units increase during the 
withdrawal what military response will the soviet union make 
what changes in your view will take place in afghanistan in the 
next year while the soviet union is pulling out its troops what 
will the soviet unions contribution to bringing about those 
changes be 
a any parallel between vietnam and afghanistan is artificial 
not to mention how different the nature of the conflicts is i 
would only like to remind you of the fact that prior to the 
americans pulling out of vietnam that country was divided for 20 
years into two nearly equal parts by a border along the 17th 
parallel in both sections there existed governments personifying 
regimes opposite in nature and incompatible in aim 
there is nothing of that kind in afghanistan on the contrary 
the government there has set itself the goal of achieving the 
afghan peoples national reconciliation and on this basis its own 
reorganization into a coalition government with the participation 
of all parties to the conflict 
it goes without saying that the future depends in many respects 
on how honestly and consistently all the signatories to the geneva 
agreements will meet the commitments assumed without their trying 
to get around them in some way or another or deceive their partners 
i can reaffirm once again that the soviet union intends to meet 
its obligations precisely and undeviatingly 
q you said that when the afghan knot is untied it will have 
the most profound impact on other regional conflicts too is the 
soviet union prepared to cooperate with the united states and other 
countries in resolving other conflicts for example in central 
america the persian gulf and angola 
a yes it is prepared i have already said that given 
constructive cooperation between the soviet union and the united 
states and major emphasis on the prestige and capabilities of the 
united nations its security council and other bodies political 
settlement of regional conflicts and prevention of new ones will 
gradually become an international practice a norm i would like to 
confirm this conviction of mine

henry caswell cooks his dinner every 
night takes a drive once a day and is eager to show off the 
trailer he has occupied across from walden pond for more than 40 
years 
caswell 94 is cheerful about his life and surroundings here in 
a wooded area writer henry thoreau made famous but there is a pall 
that hangs over the rustic trailer park 
walden breezes is dying 
when the state acquired the land 10 years ago the owner 
insisted that the residents of the park called walden breezes have 
life tenancy but the state ruled that vacant trailers must be 
removed state officials plan to make the trailer park part of 
walden pond state park after the last resident has died or moved 
away 
as a result long cement slabs are all that remain of many 
trailer homes in the park caswells home is one of only 20 in 
walden breezes which onced housed 70 trailers 
but residents say they are used to the dwindling number of 
neighbors in part because they all cherish their independence but 
caswells closest friend james s swaffield who lives across the 
park and will talk you blind if you let him is sometimes 
nostalgic for the old days when walden breezes was bustling and 
familyfilled 
people are moving away or dying said swaffield who also 
lives alone in his trailer every now and then you get a call 
that someones passed on 
caswell and swaffield moved to walden breezes after their wives 
died and spend most of their time alone as recently as last year 
they fished together at walden pond almost daily 
most of walden breezes remaining residents have outlived their 
neighbors and their spouses 
ed johnson 80 a widower for three years still wears his 
wedding band he is philosophical about the sense of finality of 
walden breezes 
its kind of like here today gone tomorrow said johnson 
pausing between a strenuous raking of leaves around his trailer 
when someone dies they just go ahead and sell all the articles 
inside and get rid of the thing 
johnson said he still feels young at heart and has resisted 
attempts by his children to move in with them 
this is a place where elderly people can live independently 
he said most people should realize that we dont have to be put 
away 
independence at walden breezes is so strong that remarriage 
among the widows and widowers is uncommon 
no i cant see why i would said flora haskett 75 a 
29year resident whose husband died five years ago we all know 
each other but its more like friends no romance 
haskett and one of her best friends annie weston 77 often 
miss the old days at the park but fishing is not what they 
remember most fondly 
we used to have great parties by the lake or picnics by 
someones mobile home said mrs haskett who lives in a fancy 
onebedroom trailer with a mirrored living room now were all 
being phased out

q recalling her talks with you mrs margaret thatcher drew a 
comparison between the criticism and resistance a western leader 
faces in bringing change and what you have encountered in pushing 
perestroika restructuring and glasnost openness by 
glasnost you seem to mean something different from what we think of 
as freedom of speech could you elaborate on the differences 
a what is taking place in the ussr is an allembracing 
process of revolutionary renovation of socialist society on the 
basis of the historic choice which we do not doubt and which proved 
in principle the only correct one for our people 70 years ago 
of course combating stagnation in the course of perestroika and 
dismantling the mechanism of retardation require that sluggishness 
and conservatism be overcome sometimes we are confronted with 
hectic impatience there is also conscious resistance on the part 
of those whose narrow selfish interests are incompatible with 
perestroika socially economically or morally 
however this is precisely what we mean by perestroika in the 
course of which we want to renovate our society upgrade it 
qualitywise perestroika is proceeding in width and depth 
encompassing all public groups and all our territory perestroika 
is growing and gaining momentum 
as for glasnost it and freedom of speech are of course 
interconnected however these are not identical things i would 
put it this way while freedom of speech is indispensable for 
glasnost we see glasnost as a broader phenomenon for us it is not 
just the right of every citizen to openly say what he or she thinks 
about all social and political questions but also the duty of the 
ruling party and all bodies of authority and administration to 
ensure openness in decisionmaking be accountable for their 
actions act on criticism and consider advice and recommendations 
from the shop floor public organizations and individuals 
q your dramatic decision to free andrei sakharov and to 
ease the conditions of emigration for some soviet jews who desire 
to live abroad have attracted attention around the world what 
further steps do you plan in this direction 
a our perestroika the main factor of which is creative effort 
also includes doing away with all deformations of the past years 
with everything that hampers manifestation of the humanitarian 
essence of socialism 
we know our problems and speak honestly and openly about them 
the process of democratization does not bypass the sphere of human 
rights and liberties we are enhancing the political and public 
status of the human personality many issues have already been 
resolved within the framework of the democratic process while 
others will be resolved as soviet society changes qualitatively in 
the course of perestroika 
once i said and it seems to me to an american please show me 
a country that has no problems each country has problems of its 
own human rights included of course we are wellinformed about 
the situation with political social economic and other rights in 
the united states we know well the achievements and problems but 
also the flaws of american society but we do not tolerate 
interference in your home affairs though we deem it right to 
express our views on the processes taking place in american 
society on your administrations policy but we do not want to 
make all this a reason for confrontation we consider such an 
approach to be correct fair we see it as meeting the interests of 
sovietamerican relations and their future i want to emphasize 
once again that we do not try to impose anything on the united 
states but at the same time we rebuff attempts by any side to 
meddle in our affairs no matter who tries to do so in your 
country 
we also welcome the accord on setting up a permanent body on 
human rights with the participation of deputies to the ussr 
supreme soviet and us congressmen it is the duty of legislators 
in both countries to show concern for observance of the citizens 
rights 
for the sake of our mutual understanding please do not try to 
teach us to live according to american rules it is altogether 
useless and i repeat that for our part we do not intend to 
suggest our values to the americans let each side live in its own 
way respecting each others choice and voluntarily exchanging the 
fruits of our labor in all spheres of human activity 
i am sure that each nation each people does not lose but 
conversely wins if it looks at itself critically and does not 
ignore others experience if it is open to understanding of and 
respect for a different culture a different way of thinking 
different customs lastly a different political system of course 
if it is not terrorist fascist or dictatorial

washington the former head of the philippine communist rebel 
army says he was denied entry into the united states for a weekend 
seminar despite an invitation from a congressman and assurances 
from philippine government officials that he is not a threat 
some absurd perceptions of some influential quarters in the 
reagan administration about philippine problems prevented me from 
attending said the former rebel bernabe buscayno 
he spoke by telephone from manila to the philippineamerican 
group that had scheduled him as its featured speaker at a 
washington seminar on the philippines which ended sunday night 
a us embassy spokesman in manila jerry huchel said sunday 
that buscayno was turned down for an immediate visa because of 
the unusual nature of his case but he said the application was 
referred to the state department for a possible waiver the state 
department has no official spokesman available on weekends 
buscayno who is still widely known among filipinos by his rebel 
name commander dante was jailed by expresident ferdinand e 
marcos but set free when president corazon aquino came to power in 
february 1986 in the late 1960s he founded and led the new 
peoples army which officials estimate now has up to 25000 rebels 
fighting the aquino government 
buscayno has not renounced communism but a philippine embassy 
official in washington said he carries a valid philippine passport 
and is no longer considered a rebel or a terrorist buscayno was an 
unsuccessful candidate for the philippine senate last year 
the philippine official who asked not to be identified said 
top embassy representatives informally told us officials they saw 
no reason why buscayno could not travel to the united states 
huchel said the us embassy in manila was aware that buscayno 
also had an invitation to visit the united states from rep ronald 
dellums dcalif and that he had been scheduled to speak saturday 
at the national conference of the campaign for democracy and 
independence 
the organization known as camdi includes us groups that 
opposed expresident ferdinand e marcos and originally supported 
president corazon aquino but have become increasingly critical of 
her 2yearold government 
buscayno in a statement translated for the group from tagalog 
said he applied for a visa april 27 and was interviewed on may 2 
for three hours by manila embassy viceconsul lois matteson he 
said ms matteson asked him if he might have reason to seek asylum 
in the united states since he survived an assassination attempt 
last june 
rest assured maam buscayno said he replied i am still 
rooted in philippine soil and would not stay a day longer than 
necessary 
he added she was not convinced she thought perhaps that i 
would mistake the new york skyscrapers for the sugar cane fields of 
my central luzon hometown enough for me to launch a guerrilla 
warfare in the metropolitan jungle of the biggest city in the world 
to encircle washington 
the us embassy spokesman in manila confirmed that ms matteson 
interviewed buscayno but said he could not discuss details of the 
visa interview 
another speaker at the camdi seminar university of the 
philippines regent francisco nemenzo said he also had trouble 
entering the united states last month 
nemenzo who was also jailed for a time under marcos and has 
been critical of aquino said his visa was held up until the final 
day of another us seminar he was to attend last month nemenzo 
was affiliated with a now nearly defunct sovietallied philippine 
communist party until the early 1970s when he resigned 
he said his past connections gave him trouble even though his 
last visit to the united states in 1979 was sponsored by the state 
department

israel is using computers as 
a weapon in the struggle to suppress the palestinian uprising in 
the occupied lands 
a computer linkup of the military administration the police and 
the civil and security service offices allows israel to monitor 
almost every aspect of life in the west bank and gaza strip 
arab merchants who obey the calls of the uprisings underground 
leaders and refuse to pay taxes are often nabbed in a network of 
computerized roadblocks 
on the road between jerusalem and the west bank town of 
bethlehem an ap reporter saw checkpoints where portable computers 
were used to track down tax evaders names are taken from identity 
cards arabs are required to carry when the names are entered in 
the computer it identifies those who owe taxes 
the military government demands tax payment in exchange for a 
registration of a newborn child or marriage palestinians told the 
associated press 
we are scared the tax officials catch you and seize your car 
or impose a huge fine said fahim a wholesaler in ramallah who 
gave only his first name 
a military government official said about 400 vehicles belonging 
to delinquent arab taxpayers have been seized in the west bank 
the computer is indeed the ultimate instrument of population 
control a carrotandstick operation researcher meron 
benvenisti wrote in his annual study of the occupied territories 
benvenisti said israel started to develop a computerized 
occupied lands data bank in august 1985 the fiveyear 
85million project was undertaken by tim an israeli 
representative of the us computer company data general 
the aim was to computerize all information pertaining to the 
population property real estate family ties political 
attitudes involvement in illegal activities licensing 
occupations he wrote in the 1987 west bank data project a study 
financed by the us ford and rockefeller foundations 
some of the military governments departments such as those of 
interior and transport are almost totally computerized today 
providing immediate access to personal and vehicle usage data a 
senior israeli official said 
military authorities also can gain access to the main police 
computer linked to all the relevant ministries and principal 
police stations according to spokeswoman ruth schlezinger 
she said by using special passwords a police official can call 
up such subcategories as personal data criminal records or 
traffic violations 
the data base was used on a wide scale this month in the gaza 
strip where the army started to exchange 400000 palestinians 
identity cards for new ones 
at a military office set up at a school in gaza citys rimal 
neighborhood an ap reporter saw a computer center with 23 portable 
ibm computers 
military sources said the computer marked with a star the names 
of those wanted for security offenses and a special code appeared 
next to the names of those who owed taxes 
some cards also were stamped with a warning the bearer of 
this card is not allowed to travel to israel that identifies the 
residents as troublemakers in israels view and confines them 
to the gaza strip 
the palestinians have fought back united nations relief and 
works agency spokesman bill lee and arab reporters said 
palestinians this week burned a telephone junction box believed to 
serve army computers 
but military officials said israel is not giving up on 
computers the army in fact is moving ahead with plans to 
computerize the prison system which has been swamped by the flood 
of 6000 people detained in the uprising

a dispute at georgias republican convention 
could leave the state with two competing delegations to the gops 
national convention in new orleans this summer 
atlanta lawyer matt patton took the podium at the convention 
this weekend after an angry walkout by gop chairman john stuckey 
who adjourned the meeting and left along with several hundred party 
regulars 
the more than 900 republicans who remained elected patton to 
preside and continued the convention on their own adopting a party 
platform and electing 18 atlarge delegates to the national 
republican convention 
stuckey said he would convene a meeting of the partys state 
executive committee to select the official atlarge delegates 
leaving open the possibility of two georgia delegations thirty 
other gop delegates were already picked at district conventions

a retired policeman who assassinated a 
federal judge and then committed suicide was seeking revenge 
because the jurist last week dismissed a 25 million lawsuit filed 
by the mans daughter authorities say 
charles l koster 67 left a suicide note at his bath pa 
mobile home saying he was acting alone after he was notified of 
us district judge richard j daroncos decision in the sexual 
harassment case said the fbis james c esposito 
the koster family was totally consumed with this case and it 
had become a crusade in their lives esposito said sunday 
kosters wife said her husband killed the judge out of love 
for his daughter carolee 
on saturday daronco was gardening when koster burst through a 
hedge and opened fire with a 38caliber revolver striking the 
judge several times esposito said 
it was only the second time this century a federal judge was 
assassinated on may 29 1979 judge john wood was shot by a sniper 
outside his san antonio texas home 
daronco staggered toward the kitchen door 8 to 10 feet away 
i need help i need help he shouted according to a 
neighbor who heard but did not see the attack the new york times 
reported today 
the 56yearold judge ran into his study closed the door and 
barricaded himself as the gunman followed esposito said daronco 
collapsed and died in the study 
when he was satisfied the judge was dead he turned the gun on 
himself said esposito adding that koster was found in the foyer 
a few feet away with the revolver in his hand 
esposito said kosters 38yearold daughter filed the lawsuit in 
1981 against chase manhattan bank and her boss allan ross 
she rejected a large settlement offered by the bank before the 
trial began march 23 the times reported 
koster who retired from the new york city police department in 
1969 after 20 years and was a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at 
the bank where his daughter worked spent much of his life savings 
on the case esposito said 
mr koster was present many of the days that this matter was 
being heard before the judge and there was at least one 
confrontation that occurred in the courtroom during the course of 
the trial esposito said 
in an interview sunday night with the allentown pa morning 
call kosters wife mary portrayed him as a kind wellliked 
family man who was driven to violence by the lawsuit 
it was eating away at him that chase did what they did to 
her she said carolee was trying to get her life going he did 
it out of love for her 
kosters daughter said she had been fired in 1980 from her 
28000 a year job as vice president in the personnel department 
after earning five promotions 
it was like night and day after i ended the relationship 
she said according to todays new york daily news 
the judge rejected her argument that she was denied a transfer 
out of the personnel department because a relationship she had had 
with ross was over 
plaintiffs allegation that defendant ross in retaliation for 
the termination of their sexual relationship caused her to be 
denied a transfer to the realestate finance department is not 
substantiated by the evidence daronco wrote according to the 
times 
in dismissing all of ms kosters claims against the bank and 
ross the judge also ruled that she was responsible for her own 
termination of employment at the chase bank because she 
overstated her experience and potential refused to accept 
managements contrary assessment and declined the only position at 
the time for which she was qualified the times said 
ms koster said her father believed the judge was biased against 
her according to todays new york post 
i still love my father she said im sorry about what 
happened but i believe he thought he was doing something out of 
love too

the selection of premier karoly grosz 
as the head of the communist party is a victory for reform and a 
clear shift from the staunch ideology of janos kadar whose 32year 
grip on power had become an obstacle to progress party officials 
said 
grosz replaced kadar as general secretary on sunday night in a 
sweeping reshuffle of party leadership that favored the reformists 
who now will get their chance to solve hungarys deepening economic 
crisis a politburo member said kadar had had asked not to be 
nominated for the party leadership 
there was no real reform possible as long as kadar was in 
power said a prominent party member who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
kadar who turns 76 thursday was named to the newly created 
honorary post of party president at the end of a threeday party 
conference in which delegates assailed the veteran leader in a 
manner unprecedented in the soviet bloc 
this conference marks a radical change grosz told hungarian 
television minutes after being named new general secretary of the 
hungarian socialist workers party 
grosz 57 is viewed as a leader in the mold of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev grosz has gained a reputation as a pragmatist 
willing to face unpleasant truths about hungarys economic 
stagnation 
mr groszs greatest merit is that he has not been afraid to 
make decisions that are highly unpopular said sandor demjan 
president and general manager of the hungarian credit bank 
i think he will personify responsibility and push for the 
removal of those who are incompetent and who have thwarted 
reforms demjan said 
reformers were clearly on the offensive throughout the 
conference 
in debates that were often lively and critical delegates 
relentlessly assailed kadar and called openly for new faces and new 
policies 
leading reformists in the party have argued openly for months 
that economic recovery would fail without political change 
inflation in hungary reached 185 percent in the first quarter of 
this year and its gross foreign debt is 18 billion the highest 
percapita foreign debt in eastern europe 
several of the most vocal advocates for change advanced to key 
policy making roles 
grosz becomes party leader of a revamped politburo trimmed of 
aging bureaucrats and stacked with reformers in the sweeping 
overhaul the politburo shrank to 11 members from the previous 13 
eight old members of the politburo were dropped in the 
reshuffle a new 108member central committee replaced the former 
106member body with about onethird of old members failing to 
gain reelection to the new body 
in a stunning comeback reszo nyers who fathered hungarys 
pioneering economic policies in the 1960s was reelected to the 
politburo he was ousted from the ruling body in 1973 another 
leading reform advocate imre pozsgay also advanced to the ruling 
body 
pozsgay leader of the communistsponsored patriotic peoples 
front has been a vocal supporter of efforts to allow hungarians 
more of a voice in shaping economic and political affairs 
kadar was dropped from the new politburo but the standing 
ovation he received when word of his appointment as president was 
announced signaled he still enjoys affection and respect among many 
party members 
this is an exceptional day for hungary said a prominent 
party official who supports reform kadar was a great leader but 
was clearly no longer competent to hold power 
politburo member janos berecz told a news conference that kadar 
asked not to be nominated for the party leadership citing his age 
and what berecz termed the need for renewal berecz said grosz 
nominated kadar as party president but that the veterans leader 
exact duties are not yet clear 
the move was made to give respect and appreciation to a man 
who for more than 30 years has been linked to all of our results 
and achievements berecz said kadar is the first east bloc 
leader to relinquish power after such an open debate of the merits 
of his leadership 
his replacement leaves bulgarias todor zhivkov in power since 
1954 as the only soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in office 
since becoming premier in june grosz has earned a reputation as 
a pragmatist and apparently toned down earlier hardline views 
offering any hungarian not opposed to communism and alliance with 
moscow a part in political debate 
kadar took over the party leadership in 1956 after moscow 
brought in troops and tanks to quash an antisoviet revolt he 
gradually won popularity at home and abroad for encouraging reforms 
that brought hungarian consumers one of the highest standards of 
living in the east bloc 
but kadar came under increasing attack in the last two years 
when he was seen as an obstacle to needed political and economic 
change

more than 600 sikhs filed solemnly into 
the golden temple today as it was opened to the public for the 
first time in two weeks 
the temple sikhisms holiest shrine was closed during a police 
siege may 918 that drove sikh extremists from their temple hiding 
place the separatists who have been waging a guerrilla war for an 
independent homeland since 1982 had turned the golden temple into 
an armed camp 
at least 46 people mostly sikh militants were killed during 
the siege three militants committed suicide by taking cyanide 
capsules rather than surrender to police no police or paramilitary 
forces were killed 
services in the inner sanctum of the temple suspended on the 
second day of the siege were resumed by priests on sunday after 
volunteers washed the floor of the temple with milk to cleanse it 
police searched all 627 devotees today for weapons at an 
amritsar police station then moved them in four city buses to the 
temple for worship 
police and paramilitary troops retain a cordon around the shrine 
and enforce a curfew within 300 yards of its walls 
the cordon is likely to stay in place until the government 
reaches an agreement with the sikh temple management committee 
which has so far refused its request to enforce a ban on militants 
reentering the shrine 
one death was reported in punjab on sunday night 
the united news of india said a goldsmith was shot to death by 
sikh gunmen in the village of murh near the state capital at 
chandigarh 
earlier sunday nine deaths were reported including four hindus 
killed in a bomb blast at a railway station in the town of 
ludhiana 80 miles southeast of amritsar indian newspapers today 
said the bombing appeared to be the fourth attack aimed at hindu 
migrant workers who are in punjab to help with the planting 
punjab is indias most productive agricultural state 
the latest slayings raised to more than 1150 the number of 
people killed by sikh extremists in punjab since the start of the 
year in all of 1987 1030 people were killed most of the victims 
have been hindus or moderate sikhs opposed to the separatist cause 
sikhs claim they are discriminated against by indias majority

saying whats passed has passed 
defrocked evangelist jimmy swaggart ended his threemonth exile 
from the pulpit but conceded that not everyone will forgive him for 
his sins with a prostitute 
i am sure there will be many that will see to it that i 
dont forget i realize it will be the hardest task swaggart 
said sunday 
in his first sermon since tearfully confessing on feb 21 to 
unspecified sins the television evangelist reclaimed his pulpit 
with fireandbrimstone fervor before 5000 followers 
once you look up into his gods face you will never be any 
cleaner than you are right now swaggart said 
i want to serve notice on the whole world whats passed has 
passed 
even looking back is not fit i am reaching forward for those 
things that are before i am serving notice on demons and devils 
and hell the best is yet to come he shouted 
his initial appearance at the pulpit drew a polite response but 
as he preached the congregation became more enthusiastic and gave 
him several loud standing ovations 
swaggart stripped of his credentials as an assemblies of god 
minister returned after a threemonth suspension originally 
ordered by an assemblies state council 
national leaders of the pentecostal denomination defrocked him 
in april after he refused to accept a sterner banishment of at 
least one year from the pulpit for a reported encounter with a 
prostitute debra murphree who says swaggart paid her to pose nude 
for him at a new orleans motel 
marvin gorman a defrocked minister who claims in a lawsuit that 
swaggart ruined his ministry by spreading false stories about 
adulterous affairs reportedly hired private detectives to 
photograph swaggart outside the motel 
after a sunday service at his metropolitan christian center in 
suburban new orleans gorman said swaggart needs to fast and pray 
i would hope he is already doing that but if he hasnt there 
will be no way he can make it through the battles not only he has 
faced but he will be facing in the future gorman said 
a group of former swaggart followers meanwhile gathered in a 
baton rouge hotel ballroom for the service of cross fire assembly 
an assemblies of god church formed by ministers who recently left 
swaggarts ministry 
worshiper ed paradela said swaggarts departure from the 
denomination led him to change churches 
if swaggart would have really repented he would have really 
been obedient to the assemblies of god he said 
swaggart told congregants at his family worship center that he 
still carried the word of god 
god called me as a child i love him more than life itself he 
is my life you might want to say that call is abrogated but i 
know better 
swaggart did not talk about the specifics of his sin referring 
to the revelation and the problems that beset the ministry 
afterward as this thing 
this ministry is in gods hands he said if he sees fit 
for me to sweep floors at a little mission across the tracks i 
would be honored to do so for the rest of my life 
swaggart said that only god could heal a sinner and overcome the 
guilt that follows sin 
guilt is one of satans greatest weapons psychiatry 
doesnt have an answer for it psychology doesnt have an answer 
for it therapy does not have an answer for it he said 
the blood of jesus christ is not a treatment it is a cure 
swaggart shouted as he pounded on a large speaker on the podium 
before ushers passed the offering plate swaggart referred to 
reports that his worldwide ministry is in financial trouble 
swaggart recently appealed for 6 million and three major cable 
television networks have canceled his programs 
for every dollar we get we spend a dollar and a dime and we 
spend it before we get it because the world needs to hear the 
gospel of jesus christ he said

the departure of janos kadar as hungarys 
communist party leader came during unprecedented open criticism of 
his policies and offered proof of the soviet blocs new penchant 
for orderly transfers of power 
kadar who ran the party for 32 years stepped down as general 
secretary on sunday at the end of a threeday conference at which 
delegates openly called for new faces and new policies he turns 76 
on thursday 
they got their new party leader in premier karoly grosz a 
57yearold pragmatist who appears open to political reform kadar 
was named to the largely ceremonial post of party president a 
position created for him 
according to politburo member janos berecz kadar asked 
conference delegates who made sweeping changes in the party elite 
not to nominate him as party leader citing age and the need for 
renewal 
grosz in turn nominated kadar for his new ceremonial post 
the procedure suggested the change in power may have been agreed 
upon in advance in an attempt to unite party ranks increasingly 
split in recent months over the pace and shape of reform 
in czechoslovakia in december outgoing party boss gustav husak 
also reportedly nominated his successor milos jakes jakes has 
kept husak in the politburo and in the ceremonial state presidency 
both transfers occurred without the outward tumult that 
surrounded husaks promotion in 1969 to replace alexander dubcek 
after the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 or 
kadars rise to power after the soviets crushed the hungarian 
revolt of 1956 
it is not clear how much of a role the soviets played in either 
of the recent transitions kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev has 
pledged not to interfere in the affairs of his eastern european 
allies but his reforms undoubtedly increased pressure on both 
kadar and husak 
kadars departure leaves todor zhivkov of bulgaria in power 
since 1954 as the only soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in 
office 
zhivkov and east germanys erich honecker who so far has 
refused to follow gorbachevs political and economic reforms both 
are 75 and likely will come under increased pressure to step down 
they may be more willing to do so now that kadar and husak have 
shown that it is possible to relinquish the top party post while 
still remaining on the political scene albeit with diminished 
power 
but it is unlikely that either will face such public criticism 
as kadar who in the past two decades tolerated a degree of open 
discussion rare in the soviet bloc until gorbachev took over the 
kremlin in march 1985 
hungarys relative openness was in full display at the threeday 
conference where several delegates voiced demands for radical 
reform 
they wound up sweeping from power many aging party officials 
including eight politburo members the changes leave hungary with a 
young and untried ruling body that contains two women a novelty in 
the soviet bloc 
the average age of the 11 new politburo members is 52 only 
three men have been members since 1985 two were promoted in a 
party reshuffle last june and six new members were added sunday 
another soviet bloc rarity was the promotion to the politburo of 
a former member of the body reszo nyers dubbed the father of 
hungarys pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s nyers was 
ousted from the politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing too hard 
for more changes 
the promotion to the ruling body of nyers and imre pozsgay an 
outspoken advocate of referendums on key issues and dialogue with 
independent political groups may be designed to muzzle their most 
radical public statements 
but it also signals grosz readiness to take reformists into the 
top echelons of power guaranteeing them input into a policy to 
tackle hungarys economic crisis and restore public confidence in 
the party

karoly grosz hungarys new communist 
party leader has built a reputation as a canny pragmatic 
politician with a charisma not unlike that of his soviet 
counterpart mikhail s gorbachev 
grosz 57 succeeded janos kadar on sunday as general secretary 
during an overhaul of the party leadership 
after becoming premier in june grosz established himself as a 
politician willing to tackle unpleasant economic issues while 
softening the blow of austerity measures with the promise of 
political reform 
he has moved around the country chatting with workers and 
apparently enjoying interviews with journalists from the staterun 
media during a visit last month to britain he proved to be an 
unabashed admirer of prime minister margaret thatcher 
these tactics overshadowed party ideologist janos berecz 
groszs main rival in the battle to become party chief and kadar 
himself who was left to shoulder the blame for hungarys economic 
crisis 
like gorbachev who is two years his junior grosz comes from an 
impeccable background and got his start in politics during the 
turbulent times of josef stalins death in 1953 
official biographies say grosz was born into a workers family 
in 1930 in the northeastern city of miskolc 
a communist by 1945 grosz followed his mother into work in a 
print shop by 1949 he was in budapest with the national party 
youth organization 
seizing a chance for promotion and education grosz entered the 
countrys military academy in the early 1950s training as an 
officer for the hungarian army whose upper ranks had fallen victim 
to sweeping stalinist purges 
within a year grosz was a deputy lieutenant he then served as 
full lieutenant stationed near the yugoslav border who also was 
charged with the political education of his battalion 
in november 1954 grosz was discharged from the army and sent to 
borsod county party committee in northern hungary to observe party 
organizations factories and coal mines in his native miskolc 
official accounts suggest grosz spent the turbulent year of 1956 
in miskolc removed from the turmoil in budapest where kadar 
emerged as undisputed leader after soviet troops crushed an 
antistalinist revolt and arrested liberal leader imre nagy 
by 1961 grosz had moved up to the central apparatus of the 
hungarian socialist workers party after a spell at the party 
academy and was named party head at staterun radio and television 
between 1968 and 1973 grosz was deputy head of the partys 
central committee propaganda department and from 1974 to 1979 was 
in full charge of the official propaganda machine 
he returned to borsod as regional party head in 1979 and in 
december 1984 advanced to head the influential budapest party 
which contains almost one quarter of the nations 800000 
communists 
at the national party congress in march 1985 grosz was elevated 
to the ruling party politburo 
when grosz was named premier he almost immediately acknowledged 
that some political reform was needed to complement stringent 
economic measures he pushed to control mounting foreign debt 
he pushed through the east blocs first valueadded and personal 
income taxes designed to deregulate price controls and tap the 
income from the second jobs many hungarians hold to make ends meet 
although his austerity program is to last until 1990 grosz has 
stressed there is no target date for overcoming hungarys economic 
crisis 
grosz has outlined vague plans for parliament to have a larger 
and more supervisory role in government decisionmaking and even 
countenanced dialogue with unofficial opposition groups who do not 
contest communist rule 
this government is not likely to go down in history as one of 
the victorious grosz said last fall but if we can succeed we 
will be praised for taking an interest in the country

a scriptwriters strike against movie and tv 
producers entered its 12th week with potential for a break as a 
federal mediator called both sides together for the first formal 
talks in more than a month 
the meeting between representatives of the writers guild of 
america and the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
was set this afternoon 
it was the third such effort and the first since a 20minute 
session april 18 
recent informal discussions between the sides came to nothing 
said herb steinberg an alliance spokesman 
both sides have suffered from the walkout which began march 7 
over issues of payments for reruns works distributed in foreign 
countries and creative control 
the meeting was set only four days before guild members were 
scheduled to vote on proposed contracts with up to 24 independent 
producers the vote could provide muchneeded jobs for a 
substantial number of writers said guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
leaders of the 9000member union have granted only two waivers 
to independent producers but are recommending that west and east 
coast members ratify the independent contracts in hopes of 
shortening the walkout she said 
its showing that the proposals of the guild are reasonable 
and that businesses feel they can conduct their business profitably 
with those contracts she said 
but steinberg said theyve been saying that for 12 weeks and 
weve been telling them their reasoning is unreasonable there 
cant be a settlement if theyre coming and demanding more 
so far the only independents theyve signed are none even the 
independents find their deal too difficult to swallow he said 
citing a decision by johnny carson of nbcs the tonight show to 
broadcast shows despite the strike 
on april 14 the union approved independent contracts with the 
new smothers brothers comedy hour and ivan reitman productions 
which has produced such movies as ghostbusters and animal 
house 
although other independent contracts were considered the guild 
voted against approval at the time 
ms rhoden said more than 150 producers have asked to negotiate 
with the guild for independent contracts 
none of the independents who negotiated separate deals are among 
the 200 represented by the alliance steinberg said 
steinberg said the signing of the independents would not affect 
negotiations because they represent less than 10 percent of 
feature film and 15 percent of television production 
producers say the strike has cost the industry more than 15 
million in lost jobs and production time with about 1400 clerical 
workers cast and crew members laid off due to the stop in scripts

be directed at increasing domestic demand and reducing the 
countrys massive trade surplus 
the plan made public after six months of research at 
takeshitas behest puts an official imprimatur on the recent shift 
in japans economy which achieved vibrant growth last year mostly 
on a boom in domestic housing rather than the traditional method of 
expanding exports 
a summary of the plan for 1988 through 1992 said three major 
economic problems can all be resolved by promoting and 
consolidating the shift to a domesticdemandled economy 
the problems it said were how to reduce japans trade surplus 
how to improve the quality of life for the 122 million japanese and 
how to promote balanced national economic and social 
development 
if the plans aims are attained it should please japans 
trading partners like the united states and western europe who 
have complained for years that the exportminded japanese werent 
taking effective measures to reduce trade imbalances 
takeshita asked the economic council a task force reporting to 
the prime minister to produce a fiveyear plan last november 
shortly after he succeeded yasuhiro nakasone 
the chairman of the council gaishi hiraiwa who is chairman of 
tokyo electric power co told reporters in a briefing that japans 
previous 10 economic plans since 1955 had aimed at quantitative 
expansion but the new plan envisions the transformation of 
economic structure and tries to attain qualitative enhancement 
attaining the goals will mean pain and burden to the people at 
large he said therefore i believe that the understanding and 
cooperation of the japanese people are needed more than ever 
the plan will be debated by takeshitas cabinet in coming weeks 
and its general outlines are expected to guide japans economic 
development 
the plans directions are similar to those in a 1986 economic 
report requested by nakasone the maekawa report compiled by a 
panel headed by former bank of japan gov haruo maekawa also 
recommended a shift away from export industries to domestic demand 
the direction the economy has taken but didnt achieve the 
status of a report approved by the cabinet 
the new plan predicts real economic growth averaging 375 
percent annually over the five years domestic demand would provide 
a 425percent average growth rate it said while exports would 
provide negative growth of a halfpercent annually 
it offers no target for japans surpluses of trade and payments 
saying instead they should reach internationally harmonious 
levels during the period of the plan 
in the fiscal year ended march 31 japans trade surplus dropped 
for the first time in eight years from 897 billion in 198687 to 
76 billion in 198788 according to government statistics 
the high value of the yen which has doubled against the dollar 
in the past three years has increased the japanese appetite for 
foreign goods while making japanese exports more costly in overseas 
markets 
last year for instance japanese automakers fell slightly short 
of their governmentset quota of 23 million cars exported to the 
united states because japanese cars are no longer so much of a 
bargain for us buyers 
the plan urges the introduction of the fiveday 40hour 
workweek now many japanese work six days a week 
for foreign countries the new economic plan offers the 
following directions 
improving access to the japanese market so that japan is a 
land of business opportunity for the world at large 
contributing to a better world through trade and investment 
and by increasing foreign aid and capitalrecycling to developing 
countries 
contributing to stabilization of the international currency 
markets by cooperating with other leading industrial countries on 
economic policy

a 2000pound great white shark caught off of 
san clemente island drew lots of nibbles but no bites until a 
collector hooked it for 600 a fish seller said 
a weeklong crowd of gawkers restaurant owners and taxidermists 
paraded through the freezer of galletti brothers seafoods on 
terminal island giving manager dino lauro headaches but no sales 
its time to get rid of that thing he said im tired of 
answering phones its taking away from my regular business 
a collector who wanted the jaws finally bought it on thursday 
said lauro 
the fish broker said he initially had hoped to get 1500 for 
the shark because of publicity surrounding its may 13th capture 
about 20 miles south of san clemente island 
lauro said he could not sell the meat because the fish had been 
dead too long to cut into steaks and anyway many people refuse to 
eat great whites 
the aggressor a san pedro fishing boat owned by anthony tipich 
snared the shark in gill nets a few days after a great white 
spotted in shallow water off newport beach prompted authorities to 
close beaches

yankees smashed windows and doors of the stations in the city 
before they were driven off by poice authorities said 
about 3000 protesters later battled police near chonnam 
university after trying to march off campus 
students surged out of the university gates and pelted police 
with rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing 
gasoline police in riot gear drove them back with tear gas 
police said 23 protesters had been arrested but declined to say 
whether there were injuries 
the clashes came as radical groups continued to press for a full 
investigation into the armys bloody suppression of a 1980 revolt 
in kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed 
radicals have clashed with police for six straight days in 
kwangju 165 miles south of seoul hundreds of students from

some of americas future chemists and 
physicists applied scientific principles to solving puzzles that 
included dropping raw eggs and slowing the ascent of balloons 
about 1200 junior and senior high school students from 36 
states who had already competed in local state and regional 
contests met here saturday for the fourth annual national science 
olympiad junior high students competed in 22 events and high 
school students entered 23 events 
the competition was sponsored by the army reserve officer 
training corps 
this science olympiad is the first thing ive seen in the last 
18 years that has stimulated the minds of these students said 
charles goslein an assiciate dean of instruction at penn valley 
community college in kansas city mo who presided at the balloon 
race 
two georgia teenagers used motor oil dough and foam to cushion 
the landing of a raw egg dropped 25 feet to win the naked egg drop 
laura turner and caroline mccoy both 16 and from tift county 
ga high school said the key was the motor oil blended into the 
halfinch thick cushion 
in the competition mediumsize raw eggs were dropped from great 
heights and caught with cushion containers designed to keep the 
shells intact cushion materials included marshmallow peanut 
butter jello raspberry jam wet towels axle grease noodles on 
cotton and soggy whole white bread on plastic foam 
the problem wasnt really keeping it from cracking but keeping 
it from bouncing off said ms turner the motor oil made 
it stick it just sat there in the motor oil 
in the balloon race students dreamed up ways of slowing the 
ascent of balloons from the floor to a ceiling finishline 
debra martinsen a senior at toledo high school near olympia 
wash and schoolmate hungman chan a junior designed an 
accordionshaped constructionpaper anchor for their balloon 
first you find the area of density of a piece of paper and 
then you find the buoyant force of the balloon said ms 
martinsen who sat at a table in front of a scale and then with 
math you find out how much paper you need to counteract the buoyant 
force of the balloon 
ms martinsen had flown to the competition from gainesville 
fla where she participated in a threeday national humanities and 
science symposium she was worried the two events would make her 
fall behind at school 
when i get back i have five days to catch up on everything and 
then graduate she said 
not all the events were strictly scientific 
eighthgrader adrienne crosier of the caesar rodney junior high 
school in camden del fashioned a bass fiddle from a potato chip 
can broomstick handle and venetian blind cord for a competition 
called the sound of music all contestants were required to play 
america the beautiful on instruments from nonmusical objects 
at the end they formed their own orchestra 
in addition to winners in the individual events the school with 
the highest point total captured the division haverford pa high 
school won the senior division while campus junior high school in

the 4700 firestone inc workers were 
returning to work in six states today after company and union 
negotiators reached a tentative agreement that ended a weekold 
strike 
meanwhile a contract covering 15000 goodyear tire amp rubber co 
workers was ratified sunday when a local in akron approved the 
agreement united rubber workers union officials said

goodyear locals have approved the contract one local rejected it 
and workers in gadsen ala vote today union spokesman curt brown 
said 
union officials were optimistic about the firestone agreement

whats going to happen in a couple of weeks said union member 
dan hook in des moines iowa

pattern brown said 
george w aucott who heads firestones tire operations called 
the agreement fair and realistic and added that it 
recognizes the particular needs of firestones tire operation 
the firestone agreement would 
maintain costofliving allowances in each year with a 1cent 
increase for every increase of 26hundredths of a point in the 
consumer price index 
boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from 
future costofliving adjustments in increments of 10 cents 10 
cents and 5 cents 
increase retirement pensions for current workers by 350 to 
2350 per month for each year of service in addition current

sixtysix women will vie for the miss 
universe crown tuesday at a suburban sports stadium in a glittery 
program brought to taiwan after the government lifted a 23yearold 
ban on beauty contests 
the 37thannual miss universe pageant was scheduled for 9 am 
9 pm edt monday so it can be broadcast live in the united 
states 
consequently the audience in taipei will be forced to wear 
tuxedos and evening gowns at a time more appropriate for breakfast 
contestants include miss usa courtney gibbs of forth worth 
texas and miss republic of china jade hu who represents taiwan 
organizers estimated 600 million people in 57 countries would 
watch the program on television to see who would succeed 1987 miss 
universe cecilia bolocco of chile and win more than 250000 in 
cash and prizes 
about 20 percent of 9000 seats at linkou stadium remained 
unsold as of monday afternoon local pageant organizers said 
beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by taiwan government leaders 
who viewed the contests as an extravagance for a poor developing 
nation they also were dismayed by reports that a miss china winner 
performed strip dances in las vegas 
taiwan is now a prosperous newly industrialized country and 
authorities in october 1987 lifted the ban to clear the way for a 
domestic airline to sponsor the miss universe pageant despite 
lingering opposition from a few groups 
feminists have demonstrated against the lifting of the ban while 
some retired soldiers angrily denounce the pageants as a waste of 
money and an insult to mothers 
the telecast generally is viewed in taiwan as a rare opportunity 
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the republic of 
china the official name of taiwan seldom used internationally 
because most countrys recognize the rival communist chinese 
government in beijing 
organizers pledged to refer to taiwan as the republic of china 
during the telecast and promised the twohour program would have 30 
minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the contestants 
at taiwans scenic spots 
the miss universe pageant generated much interest in taiwan this 
month but was pushed into the background last week when the 
islands most violent protest in recent years broke out in taipei 
after a demonstration demanding increased government assistance to 
farmers 
the 18hour street battle between protesters and police that 
ended at dawn saturday left more than 200 people injured and nearly 
100 demonstrators detained 
missing from this years miss universe pageant is longtime host 
bob barker who resigned after last years competition in singapore 
to protest the awarding of fur coats to winners he was replaced by 
television personality alan thicke 
the 11 celebrity judges include dick rutan and jeana yeager who 
made history with their roundtheworld nonstop flight aboard the 
voyager two years ago and susan ruttan of the television series 
la law 
prizes for the 1988 miss universe include 76000 in cash a 
maserati convertible automobile and a mink coat and mink jacket

the government ordered schools government 
offices and businesses in guatemala city to close today after 
dozens of small and moderate earthquakes shook the area in recent 
days 
the quakes have caused considerable alarm among the 28 million 
residents of guatemala city and the surrounding guatemala province 
but no injuries or serious damage have been reported 
on sunday communications minister mario lopez announced that 
public buildings and businesses in the capital must close today 
only as a precaution because of the situation caused by the 
constant and continuous earthquakes 
the action was taken he said to avoid any traffic 
congestion and so that families can be together in their homes 
the order does not affect essential services such as hospitals 
and the international airport 
col juan ismael morales lopez coordinator of the national 
emergency committee initially reported that just public and 
private schools would be closed today but the order was later 
expanded to include businesses 
the national seismological institute recorded 22 earthquakes on 
saturday and an additional 22 temblors by late sunday evening 
eddy sanchez deputy director of the national seismological 
institute said the strongest quakes two occurring sunday 
afternoon registered 44 on the richter scale some local radio 
stations reported the sunday quakes caused cracks in some houses 
and broken windows in the downtown commercial area 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate 
damage 
the seismological service measured 22 quakes on saturday with 
the strongest registering 4 on the richter scale 
the epicenter of the quakes was on the southwestern edge of the 
capital near la aurora international airport said sanchez on 
thursday a quake registering 4 on the richter scale was felt in 
the area 
a quake measuring 7 on the richter scale devastated the capital 
on feb 4 1976 causing more than 22000 deaths

some 200 police officers were converging 
on the state capital for the signing of a gun control law that 
makes maryland the first state to ban the sale of saturday night 
specials 
white house press secretary james brady was invited to watch 
gov william donald schaefer sign the bill into law today 
bradys wife sarah was scheduled to be the main speaker for 
the state house ceremony she became active in gun control efforts 
after her husband was seriously wounded in john hinckley jrs 
assassination attempt on president reagan in 1981 
legislative leaders and other top officials who helped push the 
bill through the general assembly last month were to join dozens of 
other invited guests including police officers from neighboring 
states for the ceremony 
schaefer aides say the ceremony was not intended as a show of 
force to progun groups that are collecting signatures on petitions 
to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in november 
rather the aides said the ceremony was a way of sharing the 
moment with the many people who helped get the bill passed despite 
fierce opposition from the national rifle association and maryland 
gun groups 
after losing to gun control forces in the legislature the nra 
and other gun groups began a campaign to petition the bill to 
referendum and persuade the voters to reject it in november they 
say they are confident they can obtain enough signatures to get the 
measure on the ballot 
state officials say the bill is unique because it creates a 
board to determine which handguns can be sold in maryland beginning 
in 1990 it will not be illegal to possess guns that have not been 
approved by the review board but it will be against the law for

a substitute teacher hailed by police as a 
hero in an elementary school shooting spree says she thought the 
assailant was a classroom observer before the woman brandished a 
handgun 
amy moses 29 says she tried to share with laurie dann the 
excitement the secondgraders had over an upcoming bicycle safety 
test at hubbard woods elementary school 
i really wanted her to know why the children were so happy 
ms moses recalled at a news conference sunday 
my impression at the moment was that she was a college student 
who had come to the school to observe the class which is not 
unusual ms moses said 
ms dann sat next to her for a while friday before leaving the 
classroom and later returning apparently after going into a boys 
restroom and shooting robert trossman 6 
ms dann a baby sitter with a history of bizarre behavior 
then told ms moses to herd the 24 children in her class together 
instead ms moses grabbed the womans gunhand but ms dann 
pulled a second gun sprayed the classroom with bullets and then 
fled 
ms dunn 30 shot five students in the classroom killing one 
and seriously wounding the others 
winnetka police chief herbert timm said if ms moses had 
followed the assailants orders we would have probably had all 
of the children shot 
timm called ms moses a hero 
i really just went on automatic pilot i cant explain how 
unreal the whole situation was ms moses said adding that the 
gun looked like a toy at first but after the initial shot she 
said i was just frozen 
when the first child went down my first thought was theyre 
filming a movie and they forgot to tell me it wasnt until the 
second shot that we all realized it was real 
ms danns face was expressionless and hard she said 
police also credited ms moses with giving a full description of 
the assailant who later barricaded herself in a suburban home 
where she wounded a 20yearold man and killed herself 
ms moses said she would return to the school 
i love hubbard woods school said ms moses who has worked 
there in various capacities for the past five years and is studying 
toward a masters degree in education 
i know the faculty the administration and a lot of the 
children and some of the parents i feel like the support 
system will be real helpful to me the children and the families 
everyone has been wonderful

democratic presidential hopeful jesse 
jackson today released details of a fiveyear federal budget 
proposal which would increase taxes on the wealthy by 244 billion 
cut defense spending by 164 billion and increase spending on 
social programs by 344 billion 
we must forge a mandate to reverse reaganomics jackson said 
in a written statement accompanying his budget blueprint 
the spending plan called paying for our dreams a budget plan 
for jobs peace and justice also calls for 87 billion in cuts 
in projected spending on nondefense programs and 104 billion in 
tax increases on corporations 
jackson said his proposals would also cut the nations deficit 
from a projected 134 billion in 1993 to 49 billion 
jackson scheduled release of his budget proposal for an 
appearance at californias state capitol one of many campaign 
stops jackson is making in a bid for the states 314 delegates up 
for grabs in the june 7 primary 
repeating a campaign theme jackson said he would raise up to 
58 billion a year for social programs such as housing education 
and health care by freezing the military budget at its current 300 
billion level for the next five years 
if we do not propose bold alternatives our social needs will 
fall victim to the soldiers of austerity which were in david 
stockmans phrase hidden in the trojan horse of supply side 
economics he said referring to president reagans first budget 
director 
i am for a strong defense i also support a sound approach to 
the military budget our plan would freeze military spending 
jackson said in the prepared statement even after the jackson 
cuts real military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than 
in 1980 
the biggest tax increase in jacksons budget plan would restore 
the top 385 percent income tax rate on the nations top 600000 
taxpayers other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax 
rate on corporations limit deductions for business meals to 50 
percent and impose a 7billionayear polluters tax on 
corporations 
among his proposed spending increases described as new 
investments are programs which by 1993 would spend an extra 20 
billion annually on education and job training 17 billion on 
housing programs 12 billion on health and nutrition programs and 
3 billion more annually on aids programs 
it also includes 5 billion more in transportation funding 17 
billion annually on environmental programs and 1 billion more 
annually for international economic assistance 
the jackson budget chooses social and economic investment over 
military spending restores a measure of tax progressivity and 
promotes a balanced mix of monetary and fiscal policy these 
choices can only help the economy he said 
following release of his budget proposal jackson scheduled a 
visit to the nearby rancho seco nuclear power plant on the 
invitation of critics of that plant who are sponsoring a ballot 
initiative to mandate permanent closing of the publicly owned 
reactor 
jackson was continuing his campaign sunday while democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis and republican nomineetobe george 
bush took weekend breathers 
jackson joined a rally of striking teamsters at a salinas frozen 
foods processing plant on sunday and administered wedding vows to 
the daughter of a california educator who is a hostage in lebanon 
he told striking workers they are victims of economic 
violence and that the democratic party should stand with them by 
adopting his 10point plan for democracy in the work place 
the democratic party must stand with the working people its 
the legacy of president franklin roosevelt its the unfinished 
business of dr martin luther king jackson said 
he said dukakis by contrast had offered an economic vision 
that is very conservative very cautious very inadequate 
the present conservative commitment by mr dukakis to economic 
change represents no hope for the homeless no hope for the 
homeless the uneducated jackson said 
later jackson administered wedding vows to the daughter of 
alann steen who has been held hostage in lebanon since jan 24 
1987 
jackson said he hoped by participating in the wedding of rebecca 
steen a 26yearold paramedic in santa cruz and jim monday a 
33yearold santa cruz fireman that in some unlit corner of 
lebanon this news may reach and cheer a hostage 
we will not rest until all the hostages are set free we will 
not rest until the whole middle east is set free because the whole 
middle east is held hostage jackson said as he introduced the 
newlyweds at a campaign rally immediately after administering their 
vows

syria rejected an iranian offer to form a 
joint military force to end the protracted fighting between two 
shiite moslem factions in beiruts southern slums two newspapers 
reported today 
the 18 foreign hostages believed held in the slums were a key 
factor in the negotiations between the two countries one of the 
newspapers said 
police said the syrianbacked amal militia and proiranian 
hezbollah forces battled for an 18th straight day today trading 
fire with rockets and mortars and leaving five people dead and 46 
wounded the two factions are fighting for control of the 16 square 
miles of slums at least 271 people have been killed and 919 
wounded since the fighting broke out may 6 
iran has proposed forming a joint military force with syria and 
moving into the slums to stop the fighting according to reports 
today in beiruts two leading dailies the independent annahar and 
the leftist assafir 
the papers said that amal officials and brig gen ali hammoud 
syrias military intelligence chief in west beirut rejected the 
offer and insisted that the syrian army take exclusive charge of 
security in south beirut 
the papers said the iranian offer was proposed by deputy foreign 
minister hossein sheikholeslam during an overnight meeting with 
hammoud and amal officials representatives of hezbollah or party 
of god also reportedly attended the meeting 
annahar said sheikholeslam also declared two conditions for 
approving a syrian military intervention in the slums they were 
resolving the problem of the hostages who include nine 
americans in a way that serves the objective for which they were 
kidnapped he did not elaborate but said it was a vital issue 
for iran 
guarantees that hezbollah would be free to continue political 
activities in the slums after the syrian deployment 
the two dailies said the differences probably will delay the 
entry of syrian troops into the slums while further contacts were 
made between syrian president hafez assad and iranian president ali 
khamenei 
syria has had 7500 troops 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles 
massed around the slums since sunday after hezbollah overran amal 
strongholds and seized control of 90 percent of the urban 
battleground 
syria is irans main arab ally in the 7yearold persian gulf 
war with iraq but irans drive through hezbollah to dominate 
lebanons 12 million shiites has strained that alliance the 
syrians consider lebanon to be within their sphere of influence and 
vital to their security 
amal spokesmen have complained publicly that delaying the syrian 
deployment will only prolong the plight of thousands of civilians 
trapped in the slums 
the syrians while seeking to avoid a confrontation with iran 
over lebanon appear determined to send their troops into south 
beirut long a haven for shiite kidnappers hijackers and assassins 
theres no way to stop the fighting other than a syrian 
military deployment brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon said in a statement broadcast sunday 
by beirut radio stations 
he did not set a specific deadline for deployment in the 
labyrinthine slums but he noted by the time we deploy i hope 
there will be no hostages left in captivity he did not elaborate 
most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon are believed held by 
exteremists linked to hezbollah syria has warned that any harm 
befalling the hostages will be regarded as an aggressive act 
against syria

a group of lithuanians defied government warnings 
and staged a demonstration in the baltic republic to commemorate 
deportations of their countrymen 40 years ago dissidents and 
official media reported today 
tass the official news agency said about 300 people gathered 
to shout antisoviet slogans on a central square of vilnius the 
lithuanian capital 
extremist elements who do not like processes of 
democratization and renovation of society which are under way in 
the ussr today made an attempt to stage an antisocial 
manifestation in vilnius tass said in describing sundays 
protest 
telephone calls to vilnius did not go through so there was no 
way to verify the information directly 
however one moscowbased dissident valery senderov said he 
learned from phone contacts with the region that a demonstration 
occurred 
alexander ogorodnikov another moscow activist today said 
several leading lithuanian activists were held under house arrest 
to prevent participation in the rally tass said no one was 
detained in sundays protest even though some people violated 
public order 
on saturday local authorities organized an official rally in 
vilnius apparently to try to head off the unsanctioned protest 
tass said thousands of people gathered then to pay tribute to the 
innocent victims of the violation of laws during the years of 
stalins personality cult 
a new yorkbased group called lithuanian catholic religious aid 
had reported last week that lithuanian human rights activists 
planned to demonstrate in vilnius gediminas square to pay tribute 
to an estimated 200000 lithuanian polish and jewish people 
deported to siberia in may 1948 at the order of dictator josef v 
stalin 
the group said vilnius city officials summoned four activists to 
a meeting on thursday to warn them against staging a demonstration 
other nationalist demonstrations were held in vilnius in 
february 
lithuania was part of the russian empire until the 1917 
bolshevik revolution when it gained independence it was included 
in the soviet sphere of influence in a secret agreement between 
stalin and adolf hitler before world war ii the soviet military 
moved in to take control in 1940 
the united states does not recognize lithuania and the two other 
baltic republics latvia and estonia as parts of the soviet union

a member of the mixedrace 
parliament was gunned down in a church parking lot near here and 
two blacks died in a bomb blast at a political rally in the black 
township of soweto 
law and order minister adriaan vlok today said police had no 
evidence that the slaying of peter sam jacobs a member of the 
majority labor party in the house of representatives was 
politically motivated 
the police have no reason at this stage to believe that the 
murder was committed for political considerations but are 
investigating the possibility that clashing personal interests 
could have led to the crime vlok said 
jacobs 42 was shot in the chest after getting into his car in 
a church parking lot following a meeting sunday night near his home 
in alberton southeast of johannesburg 
according to press reports jacobs wife and two other men were 
with him in the car when a black assailant smashed the window on 
the drivers side and fired a 9mm pistol at jacobs 
jacobs was elected to parliament in 1984 after a new 
constitution was adopted creating segregated chambers for asians 
and mixedrace people along with the existing chamber for whites 
the new constitution continued to exclude the black majority 
from national politics antiapartheid activists of all races 
organized a boycott of the asian and mixedrace elections which 
helped keep the turnout below 20 percent 
the labor party has remained estranged from the mainstream of 
the antiapartheid movement however its leader the rev allan 
hendrickse has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward 
president pw botha in the past year demanding abolition of the 
legislation which establishes racially segregated neighborhoods 
in soweto the explosion that killed two blacks also injured 
more than 30 during a sunday afternoon rally held by the sofasonke 
party said police spokesman noel hartwell the sofasonke party is 
active in municipal politics in the huge township outside 
johannesburg 
police were investigating the cause of the explosion at the 
outdoor gathering attended by about 100 people the spokesman said 
he said there were no arrests 
municipal elections are scheduled for october and the sofasonke 
party is expected to take part although blacks have no voice in 
national politics in south africa they can vote in local township 
elections 
many black activists charge that the sofasonke party is 
collaborating with the whiteled government by participating in 
black municipal politics 
hartwell said the meeting was a legal gathering that had been 
authorized in advance under emergency regulations outdoor 
political gatherings are illegal unless prior permission is 
obtained from the courts

an atlantabased group posing as a national 
prepaid legal services firm took in 3 million over a ninemonth 
period fooling nearly 400 wouldbe franchisees federal officials 
say 
the lawyers access network sold distributorships for a prepaid 
legal services plan from march to december 1987 according to 
lawyers for the federal trade commission which has been 
investigating the case 
prepaid legal services programs offer consumers basic legal 
services for a flat annual fee rather than an hourly rate 
the firm gathered 33 million from 392 people around the 
country who believed they were buying franchises by investing 
amounts ranging from 5500 to 25000 ftc lawyers said the 
figure did not include any fees that might have been sent in by 
consumers they said 
at best investors may recover only 10 percent of their 
investment one ftc lawyer said 
this thing makes the movie the sting look smalltime said 
dave mcquade a public relations director in suburban philadelphia 
who paid a 25000 franchise fee in order to market memberships in 
the network 
it was so well set up he said they just had all their 
bases covered 
the firm used false market research baseless earnings 
projections and bogus references to lure purchasers into believing 
its program was successful profitable and wellestablished ftc 
lawyers say 
in a series of legal actions that began in march the ftc has 
shut down lawyers access and its marketing arm american legal 
distributors inc which operated out of the same office in the 
atlanta suburbs the federal bureau of investigation confiscated 
dozens of records from the office during a search 
according to the ftc american legal representatives brought 
fancy brochures and a hardsell pitch to franchise shows nationwide 
the ftc also won a permanent injunction and default judgment for 
more than 3 million earlier this month against firm officials 
patrick pasley and thomas stockton 
however pasleys attorney bruce morris said the fact of the 
matter is whatever representations that may have been made to 
distributors that turned out to not be true were not made by mr 
pasley or with his knowledge 
stockton claimed i didnt set up the company i was just an 
employee 
us district judge marvin shoob signed an order freezing 13 
bank accounts and other assets allegedly controlled by pasley 
ftc lawyer norman cramer said there does not seem to be a big 
pot of gold out there at least that we or the fbi have been able 
to discover the victims cramer said may at best receive 
restitution of 10 percent 
prepaid legal services is a growth industry and a legitimate 
industry cramer told the atlanta constitution a legitimate 
plan along these lines might well be profitable its just these 
guys went too far

us officials formally presented the beijing zoo 
with two alaskan musk oxen today as a georgia woman who first 
suggested the gift beamed fondly at the shaggy animals 
fouryearold tanana a female and 3yearold koyuk stood with 
lowered heads in their outdoor enclosure as a horde of diplomats 
wildlife experts and reporters gathered on the other side of the 
fence 
theyre beautiful said helen miller 65 of moultrie ga 
said of the 300pound animals 
mrs miller began campaigning in 1980 for the united states to 
present two musk oxen to china she felt it was a matter of 
national honor to replace two us animals given to china in 
1972 that had died of old age 
the original pair had been presented when president nixon made 
his historic trip to china as the two nations normalized relations 
it took lots of letterwriting lots of telephone calls and 
lots of trips but i enjoyed all of it mrs miller said 
i heard the chinese children were very sad over the death of 
the original oxen she said so i had to find out what a musk ox 
was and how can you come by some 
as the dignitaries dispersed for a banquet tanana and koyuk ate 
grass in their enclosure and chinese zoogoers moved in for a look 
theyre not bad said a chinese man in a baseball cap 
tanana and koyuk named after alaskan rivers were born in 
captivity in a university of alaska research herd about 3000 to 
4000 of the rare migratory animals live in alaska canada the 
soviet union greenland and other areas of the arctic 
mike smith spokesman for the us fish and wildlife bureau 
said the pair probably would thrive in beijing despite temperatures 
that sometimes soar into the 90s 
us undersecretary of interior earl gjelde us ambassador 
winston lord and more a dozen other american officials attended the 
presentation 
gjelde called the oxen a fitting symbol of uschinese 
friendship and the two countries commitment to wildlife 
preservation he read a message from president reagan who said 
may these musk oxen bring joy to the visitors of beijing zoo 
we will do our best to keep them well promised beijing zoo 
deputy director shi senming 
tanana and koyuk actually arrived in china in late march but 
were in quarantine until today 
to the untrained eye they looked less than jubilant over the 
attention alternately presenting horns to the onlookers and 
turning their heads away 
they dont have a wide range of expressions smith said 
thats pretty much the normal posture 
he said in the wild musk oxen generally live to be 20 to 25 
the united states gave the original pair of musk oxen in 
exchange for giant pandas lingling and hsinghsing still in the 
washington zoo

mussolinis last government and the founder of italys neofascist 
party has died at the age of 73 
almirante died sunday of complications from ischemia a 
condition caused by arterial blockage according to hospital 
officials quoted by the italian news agency ansa he had suffered 
from heart disease for years ansa said 
almirante was elected to the the chamber of deputies 11 times 
from 1948 to 1987 he was once charged with helping a rightwing 
terrorist but the charges were dropped under a 1987 amnesty 
his italian social movement was the political heir to 
mussolinis fascist creation by 1987 it had had become italys 
fourthlargest party in parliament holding 59 percent of the 
seats in the chamber of deputies 
another former party leader and founder pino romualdi died of 
cancer friday the 77yearold editor of the party newspaper was 
elected to the chamber of deputies seven times between 1953 and 
1979 and was a senator from 1983 to 1987 
the party announced a joint funeral for the almirante and 
romualdi tuesday at st agnes the roman catholic church in romes 
piazza navona 
almirante born june 27 1914 joined mussolinis last 
government in 1943 as chief of staff of the ministry of popular 
culture he served until mussolinis fall in 1945 
mussolini who came to power in 1922 was shot and hanged in a 
public square in milan in april 1945 
in february 1979 the chamber of deputies waived almirantes 
parliamentary immunity so prosecutors could try him for reviving 
the political equivalent of the outlawed fascist party but he was 
reelected to parliament and the immunitylifting process had to 
begin again 
he never went to trial 
parliament waived his immunity again in 1981 and in 1984 so he 
could face charges of aiding and abetting a rightwing terrorist 
accused in a 1972 bombing that killed two italian policemen 
almirante was accused of helping finance a surgical operation to 
change the vocal cords of a bombing suspect to dodge his 
identification by voice patterns 
those charges were dropped under a february 1987 amnesty that 
covered offenses that would bring less than three years punishment 
in december almirante stepped down as national secretary of the 
neofascist party which supports a halt to the influx of foreign 
immigrants into italy a stronger presidency and tougher measures 
against organized crime 
he is survived by his wife rafaela and their four children

a member of the senate armed services 
committee said today that ratification of a ussoviet 
mediumrange missile treaty is possible during the superpower 
summit that begins in six days but that some senators still have 
unanswered questions about the pact 
sen william cohen rmaine interviewed on the cbstv this 
morning program about the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf 
treaty requiring the destruction of all us and soviet missiles 
with a range of 300 to 3400 miles said 
there are still some issues that senators jesse helms 
rnc malcolm wallop rwyo steve symms ridaho and 
others wish to be debated and those will take a good part of this 
week to conclude 
he added that he thinks action is unlikely before the 
president leaves for moscow but said i think its still 
possible that the treaty could be ratified while hes there 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev begin 
five days of meetings sunday reagan leaves for moscow on wednesday 
cohen said failure to ratify the treaty would be a serious 
mistake 
i think that the treaty is verifiable he said its in 
our interest to proceed and to reject the treaty i think would 
jeopardize not only our relationship with our allies but undermine 
the presidents ability to continue to serve as a spokesman for 
this country 
the senate on friday crushed a bid by the republican right wing 
to tie the treaty to ending soviet cheating on other arms control 
accords all five sections of an amendment offered by symms were 
overwhelmingly rejected and other attempts to change the treaty 
were rebuffed 
but senate leaders indicated that ratification before the summit 
would be difficult senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
said he may keep the senate working late into the night this week 
and may schedule a saturday session 
sen dale bumpers dark blamed the conservative gop senators 
for the delay saying they do not want to see a successful summit 
the treaty is going to be approved by the senate its just a 
question of whether we do it before or after the summit bumpers 
said on the cbs show i think people who are opposed to the 
treaty feel that if it is approved by the senate before then the 
summit will be successful and they dont want a successful summit

leading to the entrance of the bet breira congregation police 
said the vandalism was discovered sunday morning on the front of 
the moderndesign synagogue 
there is a great deal of prejudice and hatred in dade county

hispanics jews and gentiles needs to take place said barry 
tabachnikoff rabbi at the 450member temple 
the temple was desecrated sometime between late saturday and 
early sunday police said there are no suspects

antisemitic vandalism a total of 44 incidents have been reported

jimmy carter says that on second thought he 
probably should have included the killer rabbit episode in his 
new book on his outdoor adventures just to explain there was 
nothing to it 
an outdoor journal adventures and reflections published by 
bantam books portrays the former president as an avid hunter and 
fisherman who relishes the solitude and physical and intellectual 
stimulation the activities provide 
carter writes vividly of stalking wild turkey in the georgia 
woods bagging ducks in arkansas battling trophy rainbow trout in 
alaska and fighting a blue marlin in the virgin islands 
but the 224page book scheduled for release this week omits 
the most famous outdoor adventure of his presidency the 1979 
killer rabbit episode in which he beat back with a paddle a rabbit 
he said was swimming toward his canoe during a fishing trip near 
plains 
i guess i should have included it just to explain there was 
nothing to it carter said in an interview at his mountain cabin 
near here last week but i dont want to get into another 
altercation with the press about it that was a contrivance of the 
press 
the episode prompted numerous editorial cartoons and jokes at 
carters expense and the rabbit was dubbed the killer rabbit 
or the banzai bunny 
some skeptics claimed that rabbits do not swim but carter said 
a blowup of an official white house photograph showed the animal 
was clearly a rabbit 
he told reporters at the time it was a fairly robustlooking 
rabbit who was swimming apparently with no difficulty he said 
it would have been an unpleasant situation for me and the 
rabbit if the animal had gotten into the canoe

the communist party central committee today 
adopted a new platform for implementing soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic and social reforms the no 2 kremlin official 
announced 
yegor k ligachev told a foreign policy meeting the central 
committee had chosen gorbachev the party general secretary to 
present the blueprint to an important party conference next month 
we have every reason to say that todays plenum has worked out 
a platform for the party to use in forging ahead to the allunion 
party conference ligachev said after the 2 hour meeting of the 
central committee the partys 300plus member policymaking body 
ligachev said the central committee had a very interesting and 
lively debate and then adopted the theses formulated by the 
ruling politburo for the june 28 party conference these he said 
thoroughly analyze developments since an april 1985 party 
plenum laid the theoretical basis for the 57yearold gorbachevs 
reforms 
the platform also makes a number of important suggestions and 
proposals relative to the implementation of perestroika glasnost 
democratization and the implementation of a healthy political 
atmosphere ligachev said 
the announcement of the plenum results by ligachev could be one 
more sign that the 67yearold ideology chief is not in serious 
political trouble 
reports of a major policy dispute between gorbachev and ligachev 
surfaced in moscow last month the reports suggested ligachev had 
endorsed publication in march of an article in the newspaper 
sovietskaya rossiya that questioned whether gorbachevs reforms had 
gone too far ligachev has given speeches relecting a more 
conservative approach than gorbachev 
ligachev is chairman of the commission on foreign affairs of the 
soviet of the union one of the two chambers of the supreme soviet 
the nominal parliament he reported on the plenum at the opening of 
a joint meeting of that commission and its counterpart in the other 
supreme soviet chamber the soviet of nationalities the 
commissions are considering whether to recommend ratification of 
the ussoviet treaty to eliminate medium and shorterrange 
nuclear missiles 
plenary meetings of the central committee often take place the 
day before the supreme soviet the nations nominal parliament 
holds its semiannual meetings the 1500member legislature begins 
a meeting tuesday that may include ratification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear missile treaty signed by president 
reagan and gorbachev at the december summit in washington 
the plenum took place six days before reagan is scheduled to 
arrive in moscow for his fourth meeting with gorbachev 
gorbachev is expected to use the june 28 special party 
conference to tighten his hold on the party apparatus and to rout 
party officials hostile or indifferent to his ambitious program for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring 
in speeches earlier this year gorbachev also has said the june 
conference will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and 
judicial systems 
gorbachev has called for creating a system to replace aging 
party officials and has been especially critical of the 18year 
rule of president leonid i brezhnev as a period of stagnation and 
corruption brezhnev died in 1982 
dmitri a lisovolik chief of the us section of the central 
committees international department has said the party will 
consider limiting the communist party general secretary to two or 
three eightyear terms 
gorbachev said in an interview last wednesday with the 
washington post newspaper and newsweek magazine that he endorsed 
the proposal 
membership on the ruling party politburo can be changed at a 
central committee plenum 
at the last central committee plenum on feb 1718 former 
gorbachev protege boris n yeltsin who had been fired as moscow 
party leader in november was removed from his nonvoting seat on 
the politburo

diplomats early today just hours before the arrival of turkeys 
foreign minister a leftwing terrorist group claimed 
responsibility 
no injuries were reported in the bombings in downtown athens 
a few hours after the explosions foreign minister mesut yilmaz 
of turkey arrived for talks on disputes that last year brought the 
two nato allies close to war yilmaz was greeted at the airport by 
his greek counterpart carolos papoulias they went to a seaside 
hotel where discussions will take place through thursday 
asked whether the bomb attacks would affect the atmosphere for 
the talks papoulias said i dont see how they can affect it 
the leftwing november 17 group which has taken responsibility 
for more than a dozen political killings in greece claimed 
responsibility for the bombings in a statement sent to the athens 
daily ethnos security police said the claim appeared genuine 
the fivepage typewritten statement was published in todays 
edition of the leftwing newspaper saying the group had targeted 
the fascist turkish regime which has occupied cypriot territory 
by force for the past 14 years 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government condemned the 
attacks which damaged two cars belonging to turkish embassy 
administrative officials 
the government expresses abhorrence for these criminal bomb 
attacks and condemns most categorically every form of terrorism 
whatever its origin a government statement said 
bombs exploded at 220 am and 225 am beneath cars parked 
300 yards apart in a downtown residential area 
greek bomb disposal experts defused other devices left beneath 
two other cars parked near the turkish embassy building on 
vassileos georgiou street close to the city center said the 
security police spokesman who requested anonymity in accordance 
with greek practice 
all the cars carried green diplomatic license plates

premier to greece in more than 30 years 
greece and turkey came to the brink of war in march 1987 over 
oil drilling rights in the aegean sea

greeks who formerly lived in the turkish city of istanbul 
the cypriots are protesting the continuing presence of an 
estimated 30000 turkish troops in northern cyprus turkey invaded 
the mediterranean island in 1974 following an athensinspired coup 
since then the island has been split into separate greek 
cypriot and turkish cypriot sectors 
november 17 previously has targeted american diplomats and 
leading greek businessmen the group is named for the day in 1973 
that troops crushed a student rebellion against the 196774 
military dictatorship

first the incumbent questioned his 
challengers religious convictions and branded him a carpetbagger 
then the democratic primary race in the 1st congressional district 
really got nasty 
in fact roll call a weekly washington publication that calls 
itself the newspaper of congress said the contest is turning 
into the nastiest primary in the country 
rep carroll hubbard and lacey t smith who seeks to deny the 
incumbent the nomination for an eighth term in tuesdays election 
have traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct 
hubbard has been accused of improperly directing a congressional 
investigation into a bank loan received by smith 
in turn hubbard has slammed smith as a carpetbagger accusing 
him of moving back to kentucky for the sole purpose of seeking 
political office smith also has been haunted by a legal 
entanglement 14 years ago 
there are no statewide races on the primary ballot and only one 
other congressional race has drawn any interest democratic rep 
romano mazzoli is running hard against former television reporter 
jeffrey hutter in the 3rd district in louisville three republicans 
are running for the 3rd district nomination 
smiths race against hubbard is the incumbents first tough 
challenge since he won the seat in 1974 by upsetting rep frank 
stubblefield 
hubbard 50 has a wellfinanced campaign and is advertising 
extensively in the mostly rural district one oftenrepeated jingle 
on hubbard commercials advises smith to pack up your troubles in 
your carpetbag and move lacey move 
smith 48 moved to madisonville in august from florida but has 
kentucky ties he was a state senator from louisville in the early 
1970s and he has said that he and his wife have more than 200 
relatives living in the district 
in 1974 smith was tried on a charge of obtaining money under 
false pretenses for allegedly soliciting a bribe from an insurance 
agency while he was on the staff of the louisville mayor he was 
acquitted and smith said the charge was brought by an overzealous 
republican prosecutor seeking reelection 
as for hubbard a complaint was filed with the house standards 
of official conduct committee alleging that he improperly ordered 
an investigation of a 25 million loan smith received from a 
washington bank 
the general accounting office investigated the loan at the 
request of a banking subcommittee that hubbard chairs but found no 
wrongdoing a gao official said the agency would not have 
investigated if it had known smith was a candidate 
smith has charged that hubbard is an incompetent lawmaker who 
misses important votes and has never passed any significant 
legislation hubbard counters that smiths only goal is election to 
congress from a district he does not know 
the louisville courierjournal the states largest newspaper 
reluctantly endorsed hubbard saying 
theyve spent a lot of time and money accusing each other of 
incompetence and sleaze whats so depressing is that when you 
examine the candidates the kinds of charges weve heard seem 
believable 
in a letter to supporters before smith formally announced his 
candidacy hubbard sent along copies of church bulletins voter 
registration records and corporate publicity releases showing that 
smith was baptized in a west palm beach fla baptist church on 
aug 30 four days after he registered to vote in the 1st district 
smith later transferred his membership to first baptist church 
of madisonville 
im glad lacey smith has become a baptist since hes come to 
our area hubbard said in the letter but i find it ironic that 
he joined the florida church four days after he registered to 
vote in madisonville 
hubbards father was a wellknown southern baptist preacher in 
the area for many years 
though no reliable polls indicate how the race is going hubbard 
said he has been the victim of a vicious vitriolic venomous 
campaign conducted by a desperate man trying to do something to 
reverse the tide here in the last week 
smith who recently sold his interest in a madisonville 
engineering firm said hubbard has been a pen pal congressman 
interested only in his own selfpreservation 
if its taken a nasty turn it hasnt been because of anything 
that ive done smith said people say thats negative because 
his records negative

gop national officials will try to mediate a 
dispute that could result in georgias republican party showing up 
at the presidential nominating convention in new orleans with 
competing delegations 
at the state republican convention over the weekend two slates 
were elected one after party regulars stormed out of the albany 
civic center 
roger allen moore general counsel for the national republican 
party said gop officials would hear from both sides in the dispute 
the case first would go before the partys ninemember contest 
committee which would report its findings to the credentials 
committee moore said a ruling by the 106member credentials 
committee could be appealed to the national convention in new 
orleans this summer he added 
party regulars elected fred cooper state chairman for the 
george bush campaign to head the states 48member delegation to 
this summers convention but not until after they had angrily left 
the civic center saturday 
about 900 dissidents remained at the civic center afterward and 
elected a slate headed by brant frost state chairman for pat 
robertsons failed presidential campaign 
all 48 delegates are required to vote for bush at the 
convention since bush won every county in the state during 
georgias march 8 presidential primary 
robertson captured only 13 percent of the state vote but his 
backers many of whom are party newcomers organized in an effort 
to influence the party platform and the selection of a vice 
presidential nominee 
the turmoil this weekend stemmed from efforts by state gop 
chairman john stuckey and other party regulars to deny 
robertsondominated county delegations a chance to participate in 
the state convention 
this will probably wind up in an awful mess said national 
committeeman carl gillis all he stuckey had to do was let 
these folks be seated

a power surge or short circuit at a 
southern bell switching station in charlotte plus workers failure 
to notice an alarm light knocked out phone service for up to 
400000 north carolinians officials say 
southern bell spokesman ladd baucom said sunday a 
batterypowered system took over after the power failure but when 
no one noticed the alarm the batteries ran down and service was 
disrupted 
we missed it he said ideally if we had caught the 
alarms when we should have it would have been fixed 
henceforth additional workers will be posted at the switching 
stations alarm area to monitor it roundtheclock seven days a 
week baucom said 
saturdays ninehour scattered telephone failures affected 
customers from boone in the western mountains to just west of 
rockingham about 180 miles away frustrating callers and wreaking 
havoc with airline and retail computer systems 
calls to 911 were silenced as well leading police in charlotte 
the states largest city to post officers at fire departments and 
major intersections where people who might need help could get them 
most officers worked double shifts saturday said chip bailey 
spokesman for the mecklenburg county police department which 
includes charlotte 
we dont have any horror stories to come out of it so far 
bailey said sunday after service had been restored 
the police spokesman said he knew of no crimes fires or 
accidents going unanswered because of the telephone troubles 
in fact not too long after 911 came back we got a report 
of an armed robbery in progress and were able to stop it bailey 
said 
other phone customers were not so lucky 
its going to affect us massively said carrol mane 
training manager at iveys department store in gastonia 
were requiring credit approval on all credit purchases and 
were really going to have a problem closing tonight because we 
cant transfer out data she said saturday evening 
martha eddins a spokeswoman for wachovia bank in winstonsalem 
said automated teller machines in the affected areas could not 
operate without longdistance phone lines to connect computer data 
bases 
the situation also caused confusion at charlottedouglas

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether two us postal service workers involved in california 
traffic accidents while delivering mail must face criminal charges 
in state court 
the justices said they will hear a reagan administration attempt 
to transfer the prosecutions to federal court 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that state 
courts have authority in the cases which stem from accidents in 
santa clara county 
in one kathryn isabella mesa was accused of misdemeanor 
manslaughter after her mail truck collided with and killed a 
bicyclist in the other shabbir a ebrahim was charged with 
speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided with a 
police car 
both defendants initially succeeded in having their cases 
transferred to a federal court but the 9th circuit court sent the 
prosecutions back to state courts 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the cases should be 
handled in federal court to prevent possible bias against the mail 
carriers 
the attentuated federal interest in ensuring that their trial 
be unbiased does not justify an invasion of the states authority 
to police its streets the appeals court said there is simply 
no reason to believe that on a systematic basis postal workers 
will not get a fair shake in state court 
the appeals court added that overburdened federal courts do 
not need a new category of pesky cases turning solely on state 
law 
in the appeal acted on today justice department lawyers said 
the appeals court ruling violates a federal law aimed at protecting 
federal officials in the performance of their official duties 
the appeals court decision would permit states to 
undermine federal policies and programs the appeal said adding 
that it presents a potential threat to federal legal supremacy 
anywhere federal policies encounter local hostility 
the 9th circuit court noted that the federal law providing for 
removal of such cases to federal court was enacted in response to 
new englands opposition to a trade embargo declared during the war 
of 1812 between the united states and great britain 
federal customs officials were given authority then to board 
vessels in order to collect duties assuring they would avoid 
prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the 
performance of their duties 
the appeals court said there is no claim by the two mail 
carriers that their allegedly illegal conduct was justified by the 
duties they were performing 
there is no effort on the states part to criminalize activity 
important to federal interests as there was during the war of 
1812 the appeals court said 
the case is mesa vs california 871206

the supreme court today let stand a 100000 
libel award won against a richmond va newspaper and one of its 
reporters by a high school teacher in that city 
the justices without comment refused to hear the richmond 
timesdispatchs challenge of the judgment won by vernelle 
lipscomb a longtime english teacher in richmonds public schools 
ms lipscomb then head of the english department at thomas 
jefferson high school sued over an aug 16 1981 article that ran 
atop the newspapers front page 
in it students and their parents were quoted as calling ms 
lipscomb disorganized erratic forgetful and unfair and 
charging that she demeans and humiliates students 
ms lipscomb was quoted as saying she had been advised by her 
lawyer not to talk about the complaints 
a state court jury finding that the article included libelous 
statements made with actual malice awarded ms lipscomb 1 
million in compensatory damages from the newspaper and charles e 
cox the reporter who wrote the article 
the jury also ordered cox to pay 45000 in punitive damages 
the presiding judge later reduced the compensatorydamages award 
to 100000 
the virginia supreme court last oct 30 ruled that the trial 
judge erred in considering ms lipscomb a public official rather

a large iranian warship two frigates and 
a landing craft sailed in coastal waters in the strait of hormuz 
today shipping executives reported iran said it was conducting 
naval manuevers in the area 
the executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
vessels could not be identified as to type or number but it 
appeared that one described as very large could be a 
destroyer 
none of irans three destroyers has been active in the persian 
gulf for more than a year 
iran announced sunday that it was carrying out naval exercises 
in the persian gulf and the gulf of oman and that the 50 ships 
participating included missile carrying destroyers destroyers 
missile launching frigates and personnel carriers 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported today that 
iranian armed forces staged amphibious maneuvers in the gulf of 
oman to demonstrate that the us navy has not crippled its naval 
forces 
the agency monitored in nicosia said the maneuvers involved 
various land sea and air operations and included electronic 
jamming of radar and radio communications aircraft detection 
paratroop drops and air raid interceptions 
irna quoted an unidentified naval intelligence officer as saying 
the exercises were aimed at disproving us claims that it had 
crippled half the hardware of the iranian navy in clashes on 
april 18 
the united states has not claimed to have cut irans navy by 
half but said its warships and combat jets sank or crippled six 
iranian vessels in the daylong fighting 
these included the 1540ton britishbuilt frigate sahand a 
fast attack patrol boat and two armed speedboats sunk the frigate 
sabalan disabled and a speedboat probably sunk 
iran has said more than 40 of its men were killed and several 
vessels including the sahand and sabalan were damaged by missiles 
and bombs the only us casualties were two marine corps pilots 
killed when their ah1 cobra helicopter gunship was lost possibly 
to iranian fire 
the united states has since broadened the role of us warships 
in the gulf enabling them to intervene in attacks by iranian 
gunboats on neutral shipping under any nonbelligerent flag and in 
international waters 
janes fighting ships an authoritative naval reference says 
irans forces include three destroyers the damavand a 3360ton 
destroyer built for the royal navy in 1945 and two former american 
warships launched in 1944 the 3320ton destroyers babr and palang 
all of these vessels sold to iran in the late 1960s and early 
1970s were fitted with surfacetosurface and antiaircraft 
missiles and other weapons but none have been reported operating 
in at least the past year

the supreme court in a case the insurance 
industry was watching closely today let stand a ruling that 
millions of socalled fixed annuities are subject to federal 
securities law 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that fixed 
annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the 
same as stocks and bonds 
fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as insurance 
contracts because investors never risk their principal annuity 
holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus a 
certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals 
in 1985 10 million individual annuities representing 24 
billion in present and deferred annual payments were outstanding 
according to insurance industry sources 
some 33 million americans were covered under private pension 
plans funded by group annuity contracts that received 35 billion 
in contributions during that year and paid out 10 billion in 
benefits 
there also existed seven million universal life policies a 
form of annuities representing 564 billion of insurance in 1985 
holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of 
return on contributions and most annuity plans provide for 
excess interest paid at the discretion of the annuity company 
in 1967 the supreme court ruled that socalled variable 
annuities those that do not assure any minimum interest payments 
on contributions may be treated as securities regulated by federal 
law 
but a ruling by the 7th us circuit court of appeals last april 
15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was treated as a security 
beverly otto sued the variable annuity life insurance co 
valic in 1982 charging the texasbased stock insurance company 
with failing to disclose the method it used to calculate 
excessinterest payments 
her class action lawsuit was filed in behalf of all illinois 
residents who invested in valics fixed annuity program between 
oct 17 1975 and aug 2 1982 the suit contended that the fixed 
annuity is a security and that valic had violated antifraud 
provisions of federal securities law 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that the fixed 
annuity is not a security 
but the 7th circuit court reversed that ruling reinstating the 
suit 
the appeals court relied in part on a 1986 rule issued by the 
securities and exchange commission providing certain annuities with 
a safe harbor exclusion from federal securities law 
the appeals court said valics fixed annuity did not qualify for 
such treatment because its excessinterest rate on existing 
deposits could be changed at any time at valics discretion 
in the appeal acted on today valic said the courts ruling 
will unquestionably increase insurance companies costs of doing 
business which will make annuities more expensive for consumers 
and limit the availability of these policies 
the appeal was supported in friendofthecourt briefs 
submitted by the american council of life insurance the national 
association of insurance commissioners the national association of 
life companies and the national organization of life and health 
insurance guaranty associations 
the case is valic vs otto 87600

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
says the swiss supreme court violated that countrys laws by 
allowing investigators to examine his bank accounts 
the court announced saturday that it had ordered credit suisse 
to open the records to swiss investigators despite objections 
raised by the bank 
the philippine government of president corazon aquino had asked 
switzerland for help in locating an estimated 1 billion marcos 
allegedly deposited in swiss banks 
according to a statement released sunday night by marcos 
spokesman gemmo trinidad swiss authorities told the aquino 
government last year that under swiss law criminal charges would 
have to be filed against marcos in the philippines before his bank 
accounts could be investigated 
the philippine supreme court recently certified that no criminal 
charges have been filed against marcos in any philippine court 
trinidad said 
the news that the swiss supreme count announced that it has 
authorized a bank to allow investigators to examine bank account 
records is definitely contrary to swiss laws governing bank 
deposits trinidad said 
the courts ruling does not affect a freeze that has been placed 
on marcos accounts swiss justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler 
said in lausanne 
marcos has lived here since he fled the philippines in 1986

the supreme court today gave states some power 
to enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities 
for hazards unrelated to radiation 
the court in a 62 ruling said a worker injured falling from a 
scaffold at a nuclear plant in ohio is entitled to seek a bonus 
compensation award 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said federal 
law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety 
regulations at federal facilities by awarding supplemental workers 
compensation for code violations 
congress reluctance to allow direct state regulation of 
federal projects does not bar incidental regulatory effects 
arising from the enforcement of a workers compensation law like 
ohios that provides an additional award when the injury is caused 
by the breach of a safety regulation marshall said 
the court ruled against goodyear atomic corp which operates 
the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant near piketon ohio 
the federally owned plant enriches and refines nuclear fuel used 
for civililan energy and for weapons and navy submarines and ships 
esto r miller a mechanic was injured on july 30 1980 when 
his glove caught on a bolt protruding from the mobile scaffold on 
which he was working miller was pulled from the platform and broke 
his ankle falling to the ground some six feet below 
miller was awarded 9000 in workmens compensation he sought 
an additional award of between 1328 and 4429 fgrom goodyear 
atomic because he said the scaffold was defective and violated 
ohio safety regulations 
the ohio supreme court ruled in 1986 that miller is entitled to 
seek the additional compensation 
justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor in a dissenting 
opinion written by white said congress did not intend to expose 
federal facilities to such state regulation 
justice anthony m kennedy did not take part in the ruling 
the case is goodyear atomic vs miller 861172

two senators and an 11member coalition of 
health groups called today for increased spending on disorders that 
afflict senior citizens saying the money will be needed to cope 
with the largest senior boom in history 
the task force for aging research funding recommended that the 
nation spend 340 million above current levels on research into 
strokes alzheimers disease and other afflictions the figure is 
278 million higher than what president reagan has requested for 
fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
we wont be able to accomplish this budget but we ought to 
push for it said sen pete domenici rnm ranking republican 
on the senate budget committee its very practical its an 
absolute must when you look at the demographics and the cost of 
health care 
sen john melcher dmont chairman of the senate special 
committee on aging said senior citizens groups are leading the 
push for the additional spending but its for the benefit of 
those to follow since the research wont bear fruit for 10 to 20 
years 
daniel perry executive director of the nonpartisan alliance for 
aging research said onethird of the 450 billion spent annually 
on health care is on the 12 percent of the population over 65 
with no medical breakthroughs perry said by the middle of the 
next century there will be three times more hip fractures four 
times as much demand for nursing home beds and eight times as many 
cases of dementia as in 1980 
our goal is not simply a longer life span but a longer 
healthspan he said 
in its report the task force says less than 05 percent of the 
146 billion spent annually on health care for those over 65 goes 
for research to prevent and treat agerelated problems this 
represents a poor investment strategy for a nation soon to 
experience the largest senior boom in history the report said 
the number of americans over 85 currently 27 million is 
expected to double by the end of the century and quadruple in the 
next 60 years the task force said 
we can tinker with changes in the health care delivery system 
which can produce some savings but these savings will not equal 
the longterm benefits of dramatic medical and scientific changes 
that will alter the way we experience old age the report said 
the task force called for a national focus on research to help 
lower medical expenses and improve the health of older americans 
including higher investments in basic research and research 
targeted at specific diseases such as alzheimers faster clinical 
trials greater support and training for geriatric medicine and 
further study of the psychological behavioral and sociological 
aspects of aging 
the agencies receiving budget increases under the task force 
proposal would be the national institute on aging the national 
institute of mental health the national institute of neurological 
and communicative disorders and stroke the national institute of 
arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases and the veterans 
administration 
members of the task force are the alliance for aging research 
the alzheimers disease and related disorders association the 
american cancer society the american diabetes association the 
american geriatrics society the american heart association the 
institute for advanced studies in immunology and aging the 
national committee for research in neurological and communicative 
disorders the national foundation for long term health care the 
national osteoporosis foundation and paralyzed veterans of america

his candidacy for a third term in the us senate saying the 
welfare of young americans and fighting drugs will be among his 
chief concerns 
the issue of drugs is a tormenting one in this country now i 
have been and will continue to be seized with the issue of drug 
abuse the new york democrat said after announcing his candidacy 
outside a syracuse office building

rebuilding the nations transportation system would be among the

medical costs are covered 
moynihan 61 was scheduled to repeat his announcement this 
afternoon at the manhattan center of mathematics and science and 
attend a fundraising rally in new york city 
the senator cited his longstanding efforts in the battle against 
drugs in response to the charge made by his likely republican 
opponent long island attorney robert mcmillan that moynihan was 
soft on drugs 
moynihan noted that as president john kennedys assistant for 
urban affairs he conceived the strategy that broke the notorious 
french connection of heroin traffic flowing into the united 
states from turkey via france 
if anybody has that record please come forward and tell us 
about it said moynihan who is cochairman of the senates 
democratic task force on substance abuse i saw the job through 
i mean to see this one through as well 
mcmillan 55 has not yet officially announced his candidacy but 
has been lining up the support of gop leaders behind a probable run 
moynihan defeated former state assemblywoman florence sullivan 
of brooklyn by more than 15 million votes in 1982 the largest 
margin in a us senate election in new york state history he won 
the seat in 1976 by defeating republican incumbent james buckley

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
overturning the adoption by a mississippi couple of choctaw indian 
twins 
the justices said they will hear arguments by tribal leaders 
that state courts lacked the authority to grant the adoption 
the children a boy and a girl were born dec 29 1985 in 
philadelphia miss near the choctaw reservation their mother 
jennie bell and their father windell jefferson are members of 
the mississippi band of choctaw indians 
the twins were put up for adoption by their parents and were 
adopted by orrey and vivian holyfield 
a mississippi judge noting that ms bell had traveled off the 
reservation to give birth said the choctaw tribe therefore never 
obtained exclusive jurisdiction over the children the 
mississippi supreme court upheld the adoption 
choctaw leaders said the ruling unlawfully violates the tribes 
sovereignty over its own legal affairs 
they also said the decision could encourage illegal adoption of 
choctaw babies by making mississippi a potential adoption mecca 
for among others black marketeers trading in indian children

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating a massachusetts childpornography law a state court 
said could be used to prosecute parents who photograph their naked 
infant children on the beach 
the justices voted to review a massachusetts supreme judicial 
court ruling reached by a 43 vote that the state law too broadly 
interferes with a form of expression 
the state court ruling overturned the criminal conviction in 
worcester county of douglas oakes for soliciting a child to pose 
for pornographic purposes 
prosecutors said oakes in 1984 induced his 14yearold 
stepdaughter to pose for photographs while clothed only in bikini 
underpants and with a scarf draped around her neck 
police were contacted after the girls mother discovered the 
photographs 
when oakes appealed the states highest court threw out his 
conviction and dismissed the criminal indictment 
the state courts 43 majority said photography is a form of 
expression with which the state may interfere only when the 
interference serves an important governmental purpose and is 
narrowly drawn to serve that purpose 
looking at the state law involved the state court said the 
overbreadth is substantial it criminalizes conduct that virtually 
every person would regard as lawful 
for example the state court added the law makes a 
criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her 
naked oneyearold running on a beach or romping in a wading pool 
the state courts three dissenters said taking photographs is 
not a form of expression and the narrowly drawn test 
traditionally used in freespeech cases should not have been used 
in the appeal acted on today massachusetts attorney general 
james m shannon said a 1982 supreme court decision excluding child 
pornography from freespeech protections established that states 
are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic 
depictions of children than might be appropriate in other 
contexts 
the case is massachusetts vs oakes 871651

wheat one of 23 people charged in the conspiracy had 
challenged the conviction on grounds that he wrongly was denied the 
defense lawyer of his choice 
wheat had sought to have lawyer eugene iredale join another 
attorney in representing him but the presiding judge rejected 
wheats request because iredale already represented two other 
accused conspirators who possibly would have been called to testify 
against wheat 
wheat had argued that the mere possibility of a conflict of 
interest for a defense lawyer cannot suffice to veto a defendants 
choice of lawyers especially when the defendant is willing to 
waive any right to conflictfree representation 
but writing for the court today chief justice william h 
rehnquist said a defendants waiver cannot cure the problems caused 
by one lawyer representing more than one defendant in the samg he 
inter4v interest in the rendition of just verdicts in criminal 
cases may be jeopardized by unregulated multiple representation 
he said 
rehnquist said trial judges must recognize a presumption in 
favor of a defendants counsel of choice but he said that 
presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual 
conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict 
rehnquist was joined by justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan john paul 
stevens and harry a blackmun voted to overturn wheats conviction 
writing for himself and brennan marshall said i believe that 
the potential for a conflict of interest in this case did not 
overcome wheats right to choose his own counsel 
writing for himself and blackmun stevens said wheat should have 
been allowed additional counsel of his choice because he still 
would have had legal representation if an actual conflict developed 
in this case it is abundantly clear to me that the district 
judge abused his discretion and deprived wheat of a 
constitutional right of such fundamental character that reversal is 
required stevens said 
in other action the court 
agreed to consider reinstating a massachusetts 
childpornography law a state court said could be used to prosecute 
parents who photograph their naked infant children on the beach 
the justices voted to review a massachusetts supreme judicial 
court ruling reached by a 43 vote that the state law too broadly 
interferes with a form of expression 
gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal 
nuclear producti on facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation 
the court in a 62 ruling said a worker injured falling from a 
scaffold at a nuclear plant in ohio is entitled to seek a bonus 
compensation award 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said federal 
law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety 
regulations at federal fcilities by awarding supplemental workers 
compensation for code violations 
let stand a ruling that millions of socalled fixed annuities 
are subject to federal securities law 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that fixed 
annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the 
same as stocks and bonds 
let stand a 100000 libel award won against a richmond va 
newspaper and one of its reporters by a high school teacher in that 
city 
the justices without comment refused to hear the richmond

that he will seek the republican nomination for governor setting 
the stage for a race in which the stalled seabrook nuclear plant is 
likely to figure prominently 
rep judd gregg said he would bring to the statehouse a record 
of fiscal restraint and common sense a record of commitment to 
low taxation and an understanding of the basic values of new 
hampshire 
manchester mayor robert shaw also is seeking the gop nomination 
republican gov john sununu announced a week ago he will not 
seek a fourth twoyear term 
gregg a 41yearold lawyer said he favors allowing seabrook to 
go into operation provided it meets certain conditions including 
having a safe workable evacuation plan 
he also said the plants cost should be shared by consumers 
investors and debtholders 
shaw 53 today called seabrook a monumental disaster and 
said he will fight to have it converted to natural gas 
already that incredibly expensive and politically mismanaged 
project has bankrupted the states largest utility now it 
threatens to impoverish the rest of us as well shaw said 
seabrook has yet to go into operation because of emergency 
evacuation obstacles a delay that forced its lead owner public 
service company of new hampshire to seek bankruptcy protection 
last year 
portsmouth lawyer paul mceachern has announced for the 
democratic nomination mceachern a leading opponent of seabrook 
lost to sununu in 1986

president reagan has sent an emissary back to 
panama for more talks aimed at the removal from power of ruler 
manuel antonio noriega and the administration wants the issue 
cleared up before the moscow summit an official said today 
it would be desirable to clear it up while the presidents on 
our own soil said michael armacost undersecretary of state 
reagan leaves washington on wednesday for a stopover in 
helsinki finland before arriving in moscow on sunday 
the president at a ceremony in the rose garden dealing with 
world trade was asked if there would be an agreement with noriega 
before wednesday were not going by time were going by 
quality reagan said 
hpo4greater than 
rafficking indictments against the panamanian general reagan said 
nothings been settled its still in the works 
michael g kozak the state departments deputy assistant 
secretary returned to panama after briefing reagan and other top 
officials over the weekend on negotiations for noriegas removal 
kozak had spent virtually all of may in panama trying to work out 
an agreement 
armacost said that kozak wasnt going down with an ultimatum 
and that it was uncertain whether the negotiations would be 
resolved before the summit 
kozak is back down there and i dont expect that the 
presidents going to want to spend his time in moscow talking to 
mr mikhail s gorbachev about noriega armacost said he said 
negotiations with the panamanian leader were proceeding 
kozaks latest trip comes amid uncertainty about the 
administrations strategy in dealing with noriega 
lt gen colin powell the national security adviser said 
sunday that reagan was undecided on approval of a deal for noriega 
to step down powell said the united states has put the plan on 
the table 
the proposal calls for the united states to continue recognizing 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle as panamas legitimate leader 
rather than noriegas handpicked choice and the current president 
manuel solis palma powell said on cbstvs face the nation 
secretary of state george p shultz interviewed on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley also denied reports that the 
reagan administration had agreed to recognize palma as part of the 
deal for noriega to step down 
no i dont know where you get that understanding theres 
nothing to that shultz said 
the secretary also said the united states has had a lot of 
discussions with noriega but we havent concluded any 
agreement 
powell who attended a 2hour session at the white house on 
saturday with reagan shultz and other senior advisers said 
uspanamanian negotiations are on hold but the 
administration has proposed a deal 
its on the table all the elements have not yet come 
together the president has not yet made a decision powell said 
the president has agreed for the deal to be put on the table 
but it has not gone to closure he said 
powell said reagan has not yet decided on the deal because 
dropping an indictment of this nature is a very serious matter 
an administration official who requested anonymity said friday 
that us and panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a 
deal that calls for noriega to leave panama for nine months 
starting this august and for the united states to drop drug 
smuggling indictments against him 
the official said the deal would give noriega a role in setting 
up a transition government before leaving and also would allow 
noriega to return to panama for holidays and to go back permanently 
after elections set for may 1989 
powell said the plan which has not changed significantly in 
recent weeks calls for noriega to step down from power as 
commander of the panamanian defense forces and allow free elections 
in may 1989 
over the last several months we have been able to put 
together a deal if you would a set of negotiations which would 
require general noriega to step down from power he would then 
leave the country for a period of time powell said 
after noriega steps down the united states would continue to 
recognize president delvalle and palma would work we would hope 
with president delvalle and other opposition leaders to form a 
government of national reconciliation he said 
the national security adviser said the deals elements that 
are on the table would remove him from the political process and he 
would not be a candidate for election in 1989 
both powell and shultz defended the proposed deal saying that 
dropping the indictments against noriega is a defensible bargaining 
position because he cannot be extradited so long as he remains in 
panama 
the indictments that were handed down are indictments that 
would be very difficult to follow up on powell said 
we have no ability to extradite him from panama shultz 
said so you ask yourself which situation are we better off in 
to have noriega more or less in charge in panama and us with an 
indictment that we cant do much about but nevertheless holding on 
to it or having noriega give up power in panama and leaving 
panama but also having paid that penalty

kissandtell books by former white 
house staff members donald regan and larry speakes should not have 
been published until president reagan left office white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater says 
there are legitimate historical reasons for writing a book 
after serving in the white house fitzwater said sunday in 
abilene where he spoke at commencement at his old high school 
but there is no reason to trash the president and your 
colleagues 
fitzwater said reagan is very upset about what the authors wrote 
about his wife 
its hardly fair to say we have astrology in the white 
house he said of the book by regan former white house chief of 
staff regan wrote that mrs reagan made decisions based on regular 
conversations with an astrologer 
its an interesting story but i dont think the public or the 
media are taking it too seriously fitzwater said 
fitzwater refused to comment about speakes his former boss at 
the white house hes paid the price by losing his job and having 
his reputation damaged i see no reason to add to that he added 
fitzwater said he might write a book about his time in the white 
house but not while reagan is in office if i do it will not 
be like regans or speakes he said 
fitzwater graduated from abilene high school in 1960

the supreme court today expanded its study of 
whether payments made to the church of scientology by its members 
may be claimed as federal income tax deductions 
the justices who last month agreed to review the issue today 
added one case to its study the test case used by the us tax 
court in 1984 a supreme court decision is expected sometime next 
year 
scientologists make payments called fixed donations to the 
church 
the internal revenue service says such payments for auditing 
and training sessions are not charitable contributions that can be 
counted as tax deductions 
scientologists say the irs has singled out their church for 
unfair treatment and is interfering with their religious freedom 
federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by 
declaring various deductions including money or things of value 
given to charities or religious organizations but such a payment 
is not taxdeductible if something of value is received in return 
a practice within the church of scientology is a process known 
as auditing in which members are expected to reach a higher level 
of spiritual awareness auditing is administered in a onetoone 
session in which the church members skin responses to questions 
are measured by an electronic device 
each branch of the church charges a fixed donation for 
training and auditing sessions and almost never waives the payment 
requirement 
the tax court ruled that the fixed donations required by the 
church are not taxdeductible contributions but instead are 
nondeductible payments made for services 
that ruling was upheld by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
in a case involving church of scientology members katherine jean 
graham of honolulu richard m hermann of los angeles and david f 
maynard of rialto calif 
the high court today said it will use the appeal of those three 
individuals to help it resolve conflicting rulings on the tax issue 
by federal appeals courts 
the case is graham vs commissioner of internal revenue 871616

an american airlines dc10 lay crippled 
near a dallasfort worth international airport hangar today after 
beif the boggy field where it slid ng dragged out onosedown during 
an aborted takeoff 
workers took several hours to haul the huge jet from the mud 
where it had been stuck since saturday 
its a slow tedious process another airline spokesman 
john hotard patrick said he expects the rules will 
end the reign of reruns on tv and by giving broadcasters a 
measure of protection will heighten the value of the programs to 
advertisers more ad revenue in turn will foster production of 
new programs he said 
the big winners today are consumers they will benefit by a 
smooth transition to a fairer and more competitive market structure 
which promises richer and more diverse programming patrick said 
it is unlikely cable systems will have ortterm political advantage 
which i cannot believe 
they will do he said 
broadcasters have been pushing the fcc to reimpose exclusivity 
rules and were happy with the final product but the national cable 
television association said the action pulled the plug on the 
favorite tv programs of millions of people 
ncta president james mooney predicted that people whose 
favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered and 
the costs of syndicated programming will go up 
the rules are similar to ones the fcc dropped in 1980 since 
then cable systems have been able to carry the signals of 
outoftown stations such as wtbs in atlanta wwor in the new york 
area and wgn in chicago which have become known as superstations 
even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought 
by a local tv station 
ted turner chairman of turner broadcasting inc which owns 
wtbs said in a statement the new rules do not give the cable 
industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts 
turner held out the possibility of a court appeal but said that 
decision would be made after the fcc issues its written rules 
jeff treeman senior vice president of united video the tulsa 
oklabased cable carrier that distributes superstation signals 
including wgn said cable systems in some large markets where 
independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming may 
have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of 
a superstations programming 
thats enough for the cable operator to drop the signal he 
said 
under the new syndicated programming exclusivity rules tv 
stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a 
syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to 
honor that contract the rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate 
rights with cable systems 
superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for 
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis under the rules 
patrick said the new rules wont go into effect for one year to 
give cable systems time to prepare 
the rules wont apply to cable systems with fewer than 1000 
subscribers about half of all cable systems fall into this 
category though they serve only about 5 percent of the nations 45 
million cable subscribers the fcc said 
you will see more diversity in programs said edward o 
fritts president of the national association of broadcasters 
though he added that rules will likely drive up the cost of 
syndicated programming

public concern over the cost of longterm 
illnesses has become the driving force behind rep claude peppers 
determined campaign to force congress to vote on his plan to expand 
medicare and medicare taxes to cover the expenses of home 
health care 
with polls claiming enormous support for a government program to 
address those concerns longtermcare proposals are proliferating 
on capitol hill 
this issue is one that voters will carry into the ballot 
box said bruce fried executive director of the national health 
care campaign a coalition of 100 organizations with affiliates in 
35 states 
virtually every family stands at risk of needing longterm home 
care at any time and none of us are protected very well against 
that eventuality fried said it cuts across age lines it cuts 
across economic lines it cuts across whether people view 
themselves as liberals or conservatives this is what the 
population wants 
peppers fiveyear 30 billion proposal would expand medicare 
to pay for various home care services for the chronically ill of 
all ages it would be financed by subjecting all income to the 145 
percent medicare payroll tax currently only income up to 45000 
is taxed no deductible or copayment requirement would be imposed 
business interests are critical partly because they would have 
to match the additional medicare tax payments and budget watchdogs 
predict the financing mechanism will prove inadequate leading to 
higher deficits or costly premiums and copayments 
the plan advanced by pepper dfla is encountering a lot of 
competition 
rep ralph regula rohio has proposed what is likely to be the 
house republican alternative a 25 million 30month demonstration 
program in five geographically diverse sites medicare would pay 80 
percent of homecare costs after a 500 deductible is met 
in the senate george mitchell dmaine chairman of the finance 
subcommittee on health has offered a plan of his own medicare 
would pay up to 2000 for respite care 80 percent of the cost of 
home health care after a 500 deductible is met and 70 percent of 
nursing home costs after a twoyear exclusionary period 
and sen edward kennedy dmass plans to introduce an 186 
billion medicare expansion called lifecare the program would 
pay for home care services and six months of nursing home care with 
no copayments or deductibles and 35 percent of subsequent nursing 
home care minus the cost of room and board 
but peppers bill is the only one heading for quick action 
probably early next month for several reasons he is chairman of 
the powerful rules committee at 87 the oldest house member he is 
revered by senior citizens across the country as their advocate and 
he has campaigned for many of his colleagues 
im trying to cooperate provided they dont make us wait 
too long for a vote pepper said last week were getting 
almost to the edge of our endurance 
initially pepper planned to offer his bill as an amendment to a 
catastrophic health plan designed to help the elderly deal with the 
heavy cost of acute illness but house leaders feared that tactic 
would sink the whole bill 
pepper withheld his proposal in return for speaker jim wrights 
promise of a house floor vote on it ordinarily the bill would 
have gone to the ways and means committee but pepper sped the bill 
out of his rules committee last november and has been waiting ever 
since 
ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill doent hide 
his distaste for peppers bill he contends it is too expensive and 
technically flawed and should go through his committee for review 
there is little doubt given the political climate that 
peppers bill will win house passage in the senate mitchell said 
well do the best we can as fast as we can maybe itll be this 
year maybe itll be next year we dont have to have a deadline 
those who work closely with pepper say it is a mistake to count 
him out this year 
kathy gardner staff director of a health subcommittee chaired 
by pepper noted that half the members of the senate finance 
committee are up for reelection and longterm care is a staple on 
the campaign trail this year she said a similar atmosphere existed 
two years ago when pepper pushed through a bill outlawing mandatory 
retirement

while the superpowers strive to put into force 
the treaty banning mediumrange missiles senior us and soviet 
scientists have been getting together for confidential talks to 
discuss future arms control issues and ways to avoid nuclear war 
thetalks taking place through two committees operating under 
the aegis of the national academy of sciences have been described 
by american participants as surprisingly frank and productive 
one group the committee on international security and arms 
control known as cisac recently completed a threeday closeddoor 
meeting with leading soviet academicians headed by roald sagdeyev 
director of moscows space research institute 
chairing the 17member us panel is wolfgang kh panofsky 
former director of stanford universitys linear accelerator center 
the latest meeting the 12th in a series of confidential 
sessions that cisac has held with soviet counterparts since 1981 
took place may 46 at a conference center in queenstown md about 
60 miles east of washington 
the tone of the meeting was very constructive and very 
friendly said john d steinbruner a committee member and 
director of foreign policy studies at the brookings institution a 
liberal washington think tank its a very pragmatic congenial 
working atmosphere 
we discussed strategic force reduction issues of verification 
and conventional force questions that have to do with the mainline 
items of arms control he said our ground rules are that we do 
not however discuss directly the negotiations that are under 
way 
steinbruner said the main verification issue that came under 
discussion dealt with cruise missiles which pose special problems 
because they are relatively small and easily concealed 
he said that over the past seven years theres no question 
but that we have seen in the course of these meetings very 
extensive development in the thinking of people on the soviet side 
who are in touch with highlevel officials in the leadership 
its pretty encouraging 
another cisac member spurgeon m keeny jr president of the 
washingtonbased arms control association said one not only 
gains insight into soviet positions but also informs influential 
soviet scientists about us thinking on these issues 
other americans currently serving on the committee include 
joshua lederberg president of rockefeller university charles h 
townes a physics professor at the university of california 
berkeley and former white house science adviser jerome b wiesner 
a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 
a second group operating under the sponsorship of the national 
academy of sciences is the committee on contributions of behavioral 
and social science to the prevention of nuclear war 
this 20member panel formed in 1985 has been looking beyond 
the strategic and technical aspects of nuclear war to consider 
questions such as how superpower leaders interpret each others 
actions and under what conditions they might resort to nuclear 
weapons 
william k estes cochairman of the committee and a psychology 
professor at harvard university said the group is starting to 
develop a joint ussoviet project involving public opinion 
research in the two countries 
he said that during two working trips to the soviet union last 
year he was impressed by the change of mood under soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
among academicians which is my immediate concern its just a 
tremendous uplift estes said for some for example 
sociologists whose field is public opinion research just a total 
liberation they can come out of the bushes for the first time in 
their memories 
panel cochairman herbert a simon a nobel laureate in 
economics at carnegiemellon university said he had been rather 
pleasurably surprised with the rapid pace at which the group has 
been able to develop contacts with soviet social scientists 
simon said he too was encouraged by the soviet leaderships 
increasing sensitivity to sounding out and analyzing public 
attitudes on ussoviet relations and arms control 
the whole idea behind this committee is that a sane and 
informed world a world in which people understand better how they 
themselves and other people behave has a chance of being a little 
better world than a world in which we fly by the seat of our 
pants he said

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev currying 
favor with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is likely to balk if 
president reagan asks him to back a un security council 
resolution barring arms sales to iran and iraq us officials say 
the persian gulf war is expected to be on the agenda when reagan 
and gorbachev meet may 29june 2 in moscow 
the soviets went along with a ussponsored security council 
resolution in july 1987 urging iran and iraq to end the war which 
began in september 1980 the soviets and the chinese however have 
refused to support a followup resolution to stop the flow of arms 
to the belligerents 
the chances of passing that resolution peaked about february 
or early march said a state department official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
because khomeini wants to continue the war and iraqi leader 
saddam hussein wants to end it the second resolution would 
amount to a de facto embargo on iran the official said 
also gorbachev does not want to offend khomeini particularly 
as soviet troops leave afghanistan and the united states and iran 
remain at loggerheads in the persian gulf the experts say 
the soviets and the chinese are key because they are permanent 
members of the security council and could veto any resolution 
the chinese who supply iran with close to half of its weapons 
eased their opposition in february increasing pressure on the 
soviets who are the major arms supplier to iraq 
but pressure on moscow fell after the usiranian naval battle 
on april 18 in which american ships killed 44 iranians and knocked 
out half the opposing navy by disabling two iranian frigates and 
sinking or damaging four speed boats 
the us action in the gulf pushed the chinese and the 
russians away from backing the resolution said the state 
department source the russians had always been reluctant on the 
second resolution but this gave them something to hang their hat 
on 
khomeini rode to power in 1979 on a wave of indignation against 
shah mohammed reza pahlavi a longtime us ally but the 
ayatollah paired his vehement condemnation of the united states 
the great satan with antisoviet rhetoric that was nearly as 
strong 
sovietiranian relations improved somewhat following the 
disclosure in november 1986 that the reagan administration secretly 
had sold arms to the khomeini regime 
and ties between tehran and moscow further improved after the 
us decision last year to offer naval protection to 11 reflagged 
tankers belonging to kuwait a nonbelligerent ally of iraq in the 
war 
lately however there has been nothing really terribly new 
in sovietiranian ties said shireen hunter an expert on iran at 
the center for strategic and international studies in washington 
gorbachev faces a ticklish situation as he fulfills his promise 
to withdraw an estimated 115000 soviet troops out of afghanistan 
which not only borders iran but shares much of its cultural 
ethnic and linguistic heritage 
khomeinis cooperation is vital in repatriating 25 million 
afghans who fled to iran following the soviet invasion in 1979 an 
additional 35 million afghan refugees in pakistan pose a similar 
problem 
iranian cooperation also would assist the soviets in assuring 
that a neutral state is established in afghanistan said 
hunter the russians do not want a prowestern government in 
afghanistan 
additionally khomeini has been backing several groups of 
antisoviet afghan guerrillas who share his fundamentalist shiite 
moslem faith 
as the red army pulls back from forward positions in 
afghanistan the iranians have the capability to make life 
difficult for the soviets at least in the outlying areas said 
the state department source 
in at least one instance the mujahedden guerrillas and the 
soviets appear to have worked out a modus vivendi 
the mujahedeen have been distributing leaflets in the area of 
ghazni in eastern afghanistan saying they will allow the soviets 
to leave peacefully if the soviets do not loot civilian houses as 
they depart said the source citing a diplomatic cable from 
kabul similar arrangements may exist elsewhere in afghanistan

in tuchomerice north of prague according to the popular weekly

opposition grew rapidly once word of the plans spread in a tv

hysteria said jan klima a prague health official complaints 
poured in then came a signature campaign of those protesting the 
plan simply enormous pressure 
he said the castle instead will be a center for the elderly he 
said 
vlasta quoted unidentified doctors as complaining that drug 
addicts now can be treated only in a psychiatric ward in a prague 
suburb or at a center for alcoholics 
vlasta first reported on drug addicts last fall and said its 
stories on the tuchomerice case brought an unprecedented 
response from readers some letters were sympathetic but others 
used strong language 
i would send them to forced labor or shoot them like vermin

media in 1986 according to the latest statistics 703 people were 
prosecuted on drugsrelated charges vlasta said it gave no

more than 1000 mourners braved a 
driving rain today to attend a funeral service for 8yearold 
nicholas corwin fatally wounded when a woman stormed an elementary 
school and fired on a secondgrade classroom 
five other children were wounded in fridays attack in nearby 
winnetka by laurie dann 30 who then shot and injured a man as she 
took over his familys home she died at the house hours later of a 
selfinflicted gunshot wound 
nicky is gone long before his time and the pain is great 
rabbi robert schreibman told the gathering at temple jeremiah in 
this north chicago suburb 
i wonder what we could possibly say to relieve such 
unconscionable grief but we can find none said schreibman in 
prepared remarks 
reporters were not allowed inside the temple for the halfhour 
service 
dozens of children many of them in brightly colored rain 
slickers walked solemnly into the temple before the service began 
a memorial service was planned later today at hubbard woods 
elementary school where fridays shooting occurred classes were 
canceled today 
at temple jeremiah a sign saying shalom which in hebrew 
means peace hello and goodbye was pasted on a south window 
after the service nicholas parents joel and linda corwin and 
his brothers michael and jonathan accompanied the casket as it 
was placed in a hearse for the drive to memorial park cemetery in 
nearby skokie 
after ms danns shooting rampage and suicide authorities began 
trying to unravel the psychological puzzle she left behind before 
the school shooting ms dann had set fire to a home and delivered 
tainted treats to two college fraternities and several homes where 
she had worked as a baby sitter 
many of those who received the treats were on a list found in 
ms danns apartment in madison wis according to police they 
said no one was seriously sickened by the poisoned fruit juice and 
cereal snacks 
this is a seriously destroyed individual who lost control and 
acted out all of her delusions said dr harold visotsky 
professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at 
northwestern university medical school in chicago 
she acted on all the elements of revenge she wanted to play 
out once you begin imagining injury or pain everyone has to be 
punished he said sunday 
ms dann probably saw herself as a victim and sought revenge 
against those who had diminished her sense of selfworth 
visotsky said 
there obviously is a connection with children here we dont 
know what police chief herbert timm said today on this 
morning the cbs morning show 
he said authorities are just keeping our fingers crossed that 
it is over 
weve been surprised very often by laurie but were ready for 
anything to be honest with you he said we thought this 
nightmare ended friday evening but then saturday morning of course 
we were surprised to find out about the poisoning situation 
at sunday religious services in the quiet chicago suburb 
worshipers were asked to pray for ms dann and her victims six 
people remain hospitalized four in fair condition one in critical 
condition and one listed as serious 
today we will pray for laurie dann because for what she did 
she could not have been in her right mind said the rev mike 
weston of sacred heart roman catholic church and because she was 
once a child and a christian and because jesus prayed for his 
enemies 
visotsky and police agreed that the trigger for fridays 
violence appeared to have been ms danns discovery that a family 
for whom she worked as a baby sitter planned to move away 
on the morning of the shootings ms dann set a small fire in 
the familys house and gave tainted milk to two of the familys 
children 
she then drove to the school and shot a boy in a bathroom and 
brandished a handgun in the classroom wounding five children 
including young nicholas 
a substitute teacher amy moses grabbed ms dann in trying to 
stop her from shooting the entire classroom of youngsters 
ms moses 29 refused to follow ms danns orders to herd the 
24 children together and grabbed her gunhand before ms dann 
pulled another weapon and began firing 
i just acted instinctually i just wanted to protect the 
children said said ms moses adding that she just went on 
automatic pilot 
ms dann then fled the school crashed her car and ran to a home 
a few blocks away where she wounded a 20yearold man and 
barricaded herself inside for several hours before shooting herself 
in the head 
ms dann daughter of a wealthy suburban family and former 
student at the university of arizona in tucson was due to stand 
trial in madison on charges of shoplifting several womens wigs 
march 14 
she also was being sought by federal authorities for making 
threatening telephone calls in three states to former friends and 
members of her exhusbands family

vandals stenciled swastikas and scrawled an 
antisemitic slogan on a synagogue prompting the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith to demand prison terms for such offenses and 
post a 1000 reward for information 
id like to see the steel doors slam shut behind someone this 
time said arthur teitelbaum adl southern area director maybe 
thats what is needed to put a stop to this 
the three swastikas and the words die jew were painted on 
the bet breira synagogue in suburban kendall over the weekend 
police said 
about 1 miles away at killian high school vandals also 
stenciled five swastikas along with neonazi rules and 
hitler lives police said 
police had no suspects metrodade police spokesman james wright 
said monday 
desecration of a house of worship is punishable by up to five 
years in prison and a 5000 fine 
teenagers charged with throwing rocks and scrawling a swastika 
at a synagogue feb 26 recently were sentenced to 200 hours of 
community service and had to pay for 14800 in damage 
reported antisemitic incidents have nearly doubled in florida 
this year with 44 reported so far compared to 64 in all of 1987 
teitelbaum nationwide there were 694 incidents in 1987 teitelbaum 
the weekend attack at the synagogue was particularly unsettling 
because it appeared wellplanned teitelbaum said sunday 
i do feel the attack was premeditated because of the 
stencils he said fundamentally it is the virus of bigotry 
that is expressed in these acts what is really worrisome is that a 
new generation of persons has been infected 
there is a great deal of prejudice and hatred in dade county 
and this act shows that more integration between anglos blacks 
hispanics jews and gentiles needs to take place said barry 
tabachnikoff rabbi at the 450member bet breira congregation we 
still have a lot of work to do especially in the religious 
community

next months communist party conference is shaping 
up to be a faceoff between supporters of radical change and 
advocates of just a little polishing up of the old soviet 
system party activists reported monday 
despite efforts by mikhail s gorbachev to draw only backers of 
his policy of perestroika or wholesale rebuilding of soviet 
society some who fear reform is being introduced too quickly may 
be selected as delegates to the june 28 conference 
a closeddoor meeting of the party central committee devoted to 
preparations for next months conference selected gorbachev to 
deliver the key address to the gathering which will pass judgment 
on his reform program the tass news agency reported 
but senior advisers on the economy and social trends made clear 
at a news conference that conflicting viewpoints on the pace of 
reform are becoming more apparent 
it has not even been decided whether the party gathering the 
first of its kind since 1941 will be televised according to 
delegate sergei p zalygin editor of the journal novy mir new 
world 
gorbachev addressed the plenary session of the central committee 
before and after a debate among the more than 300 members tass 
said no details of his or other speeches were released 
kremlin no 2 yegor k ligachev told a foreign policy meeting 
later in the day that the plenum had a very interesting and 
lively debate over the proposals to be presented at the 
conference 
ligachev has made clear in previous speeches that he favors a 
more moderate pace of reform 
the theses put together by the ruling 13man politburo make a 
number of important suggestions and proposals relative to the 
implementation of perestroika glasnost democratization and the 
implementation of a healthy political atmosphere ligachev said 
he gave no details but said the proposals will be published 
before the conference 
four of the nations most respected advisers on perestroika told 
reporters the conference is heightening differences among 
policymakers 
tatiana zaslavskaya the nations leading sociologist and a 
staunch reform advocate said if perestroika is to succeed we 
will have to fight and struggle for it to see that we meet these 
goals 
she indicated there are two groups which want perestroika 
carried out differently asked who heads the factions ms 
zaslavskaya said gorbachev is obviously the figurehead for the 
radicalreform branch but she said she did not know any leading 
personalities at the head of the other movement 
ligachev is reputed to champion more conservative views on the 
politburo and last month was reported to have had a showdown with 
gorbachev following publication of a defense of stalinism in the 
party newspaper sovietskaya rossiya but he has made several 
highprofile appearances including his parliamentary address 
monday indicating he and gorbachev are putting out a unified front 
leading up to the important conference 
in an interview with the washington post that was published 
sunday gorbachev labeled as western media creations those 
accounts that he and legachev are locked in a struggle for power 
although he acknowledged that heated debate has developed over 
perestroika within the nation 
party conferences which consider major changes in direction in 
social and economic development can be called between party 
congresses which take place every five years they were held 
frequently until world war ii 
ms zaslavskaya appeared to criticize the partys monopoly on 
power when asked about the system for selecting the 5000 delegates 
to the conference 
the fact that the party delegates are selected by the party 
machinery by the party committees effects the procedure and not 
in every case can it be called a democratic effect she said 
it was not clear whether she was advocating extension of the 
delegate selection into nonparty groups or criticizing some of the 
officials chosen 
gorbachevs reforms curry much less favor in rural regions and 
industrial zones outside the capital where many entrenched party 
bureaucrats fear their jobs and privileges hang in the balance in 
those areas party conference delegates are likely to oppose 
radical change 
on may 7 gorbachev appealed for selection of those who would 
support his approach to reform 
there must be no more quotas as were the case in the past 
specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women 
are to be elected among others gorbachev told a gathering of 
media representatives and ideologists the principal political 
directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to go to the 
conference 
little is known about the proposals to be put before the party 
conference next month although several officials have said the 
delegates will consider limiting the tenure of the general 
secretary 
there has also been speculation that gorbachev might take the 
opportunity to replace as much as 25 percent of the central 
committee ousting those who have not shown sufficient dedication 
to his reform programs 
but fyodor m burlatsky a prominent political scientist and 
writer told the news conference that as far as i know there 
would not be additional elections during this party conference 
burlatsky like zaslavskaya and the other two officials who 
appeared at the news conference is in the running to attend the 
party conference although the selection procedures have not been 
completed 
from my point of view the most important struggle is between 
those who want deep changes and others who want a little polishing 
up burlatsky said the struggle is continuing in these areas 
economist leonid i abalkin restated gorbachevs philosophy that 
economic change and broader democracy must go hand in hand 
one without the other is unthinkable abalkin said

the reformers who now control the 
communist party embarked monday on a program of sweeping changes 
they hope will rescue the faltering economy 
hungarys turn from old leadership to a new generation of highly 
trained managers intellectuals and economic theorists may be the 
most dramatic change of course in eastern europe since alexander 
dubceks liberal prague spring of 1968 in czechoslovakia 
the most important difference is that moscow now supports 
reform under mikhail s gorbachevs perestroika plan and the 
warsaw pact invasion that drove dubcek out is not likely to be 
repeated 
an outline of hungarian reform plans was revealed sunday along 
with major changes in party leadership that replaced party leader 
janos kadar and many of his aging supporters 
kadar leader for nearly 32 years was replaced by the 
reformminded premier karoly grosz and top decisionmaking posts 
went to advocates of change 
delegates to the threeday party congress that ended sunday 
dropped kadar who will be 76 on may 26 from the ruling politburo 
but elected him party president a new post expected to be largely 
ceremonial 
some party officials said kadar might seek to wield a 
conservative influence from his new position but the strength of 
reformers in the new leadership indicate they will be able to set 
policy 
grosz 57 will continue as premier until the next session of 
parliament when a replacement might be chosen 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
the united states wishes grosz well and we expect our good 
relationship with hungary will continue to improve 
the new party policy statement approved sunday gives few 
specifics but calls for a greater public voice in economic and 
political affairs it also contemplates a much larger role for 
private enterprise to revive the stagnant economy 
the economy must be left alone to make its own decisions 
sandor demjan president of the hungarian credit bank said 
monday the dullness of hungarian political life in recent years 
has clouded the economic sphere kadars government pioneered 
economic reforms which brought relative prosperity from the late 
1960s through the 1970s 
recent economic setbacks however have burdened hungary with 
eastern europes highest per capita foreign debt it now stands 18 
billion 
inflation is running at more than 18 percent annually and 
austerity measures have been imposed 
in surprisingly frank debate delegates to the congress assailed 
kadar and the communist party for not averting the economic crisis 
budapest party members who make up almost one quarter of 
hungarys 800000 communists were among the most critical they 
demanded new faces new policies and a move toward political 
pluralism 
reformers argued that economic change would fail without similar 
action in the political field 
while the policy document made clear the partys leading role 
was not being challenged it referred frequently to the need for 
socialist pluralism in which opposing views would be allowed 
it outlined the advantages of more foreign investment and joint 
ventures with foreign companies among political reforms endorsed 
were limited terms of office for party officials and laws 
guaranteeing freedom of association and other civil rights 
the right of voluntary organization assembly association 
freedom of conscience and religion and guarantees for the 
protection of individual and collective rights must be regulated by 
law it said 
a leading proponent of independent interest groups imre 
pozsgay was among those elected to the ruling politburo the 
pollicy statement acknowledged his recent comments by saying local 
referendums should be held on issues of importance to hungarians 
many interest groups have been formed recently that do not seek 
official approval and range in nature from sports groups to an 
independent labor union 
another notable appointment to the politburo was reszo nyers 
the economist who pioneered reform in the late 1960s he was ousted 
from the partys ruling body in in 1973 for advocating further 
changes 
thirtyone members of the central committee nearly onethird of 
the total were replaced by young intellectuals and workers few 
came from the party bureaucracy 
six members of the politburo are new including two women and 
the membership was reduced from 13 to 11 its first meeting was 
scheduled for tuesday

oxford university said monday it is leaving two of 
the worlds most prestigious academic posts vacant indefinitely 
citing a financial crisis 
the regius chairs in greek and modern history become vacant in 
fall 1989 and wont be filled for at least a year said anne 
lonsdale an oxford spokeswoman 
she said the regius chairs so named because they were created 
by royal command could remain frozen beyond 1990 depending on 
faculty priorities 
the decision heightens longstanding concern over the ancient 
universitys future as a citadel of scholarship and scientific 
research 
there is a question mark over our status as a worldclass 
university sir michael howard the retiring regius professor of 
modern history said in an interview we are being starved of 
essential resources 
the regius chair in greek was founded by king henry viii in 
1546 and the modern history chair by george i in 1727 both are 
widely regarded as being at the apex of scholarship 
they being left vacant as part of a retrenchment program brought 
on by an 11 percent cut in government funding mrs lonsdale said 
under the program any academic post that becomes vacant is 
frozen usually for two years until the faculty board decides 
whether there is enough money to appoint a successor 
as a result 122 of oxfords 1420 faculty posts in virtually 
all disciplines are vacant mrs lonsdale said 
failure to exempt the professorships in modern history and greek 
from the retrenchment reflects the seriousness of oxfords cash 
problem 
oxford has a budget of about 186 million and its deficit is 
running at about 33 million 
the university has announced that it will launch a fiveyear 
worldwide campaign in october to ensure the future of the 
university which received its first charter in 1213 it has not 
said how much money it wants to raise in its campaign but says it 
hopes to ensure the financial security of the university into the 
next century 
oxford is beginning to seem like a place under siege the 
author an wilson wrote monday in londons daily mail newspaper 
commenting on the professorial vacancies the deterioration of 
books and manuscripts in oxfords bodleian library and the planned 
closure of oxford playhouse wilson said 
when you have a university which cant afford professors of 
greek and history which cant afford to repair the priceless books 
on its library shelves which cant afford to keep open one of the 
most famous undergraduate theaters in the world then you are 
entitled to ask what is going on 
howard who is retiring one year early to take up a newly 
created chair in military history at yale university in 1989 said 
his post could remain vacant for several years 
theres simply not enough money to go around he said 
oxford cambridge and britains 44 other statefunded 
universities have long complained that spending limits imposed by 
the conservative government are threatening the nations scientific 
base and accelerating a brain drain to foreign universities 
critics say the government is denying support for research that 
has no apparent shortterm economic or military benefit in a 1985 
protest oxford denied an honorary doctorate to prime minister 
margaret thatcher herself an oxford graduate in chemistry 
there is a lack of understanding of the value of scholarship 
as an end of itself irrespective of whether it contributes to the 
national income or not howard said 
government officials contend the universities are overly 
dependent on state funding and have refused to aggressively pursue 
money from industry or even their own alumni 
the regius professor of greek hugh lloydjones who is leaving 
next year at the mandatory retirement age of 67 said the failure 
to name his replacement goes beyond government policy and reflects 
the values of society at large 
we have a society in which a footballer gets four times as 
much as sir michael and i get together said lloydjones 
someone who displays himself on television can get 10 times as 
much 
the base salary for each regius chair is about 48620 a year 
lloydjones said the vacant posts should serve as a reminder 
to anyone who thinks that we in the 20th century live in a 
civilized society 
howard said oxford is moving fast to become selfsufficient but 
there is a limit to what we can do over the short term

a coalition of 17 surrogate mothers including 
landmark surrogate mary beth whiteheadgould launched a campaign 
monday to try to force baby brokers in 12 states out of business 
try to help shut these places down implored 
whiteheadgould whose precedentsetting baby m story was the 
subject of a network television movie this week 
whiteheadgould whose effort to void her surrogating contract 
was upheld by the new jersey supreme court called on state legal 
systems and the media to join in a campaign against surrogacy 
she was accompanied by other members of the national coalition 
against surrogacy a group comprising lawyers doctors and 17 
surrogate mothers 
coalition leader jeremy rifkin said the group on monday sent 
petitions to attorneys general in 12 states where surrogate brokers 
are known to operate such brokers charge a fee to set up 
agreements linking infertile couples with women willing to bear 
them a child 
these are the middlemen who have engaged in the unconscionable 
act of hiring women as breeders rifkin said 
rifkin said the coalition will mount a fourpronged attack 
against the brokers along with legal pressure the group will 
attempt to marshal public opinion in states where brokers do 
business and try to force the issue of surrogate parenting into 
local and national politics 
finally rifkin said the coalition will target newspapers that 
run advertising on behalf of surrogate brokers or agencies 
were going to put all the brokers on notice said rifkin 
an environmental activist who also has been critical of the new 
science of genetic engineering 
states where brokers operate according to the coalition are 
california florida indiana kansas kentucky maryland 
massachusetts michigan new york oregon pennsylvania and 
washington state 
gena corea the coalitions cochairwoman accused brokers of 
preying on lowerincome women who need the money but may not 
understand the implication of signing away unborn children 
the surrogates are often abused physically and psychologically 
by brokers corea claimed 
we want this surrogacy industry gone let it stop feeding off 
our flesh corea said 
surrogate mother lauri yates of michigan pleaded please 
before they wreck any more lives before they cause any more pain 
please close them down yates said she gave up her twins to an 
infertile couple because she and her husband couldnt afford to 
raise them 
whiteheadgould became the nations bestknown surrogate after 
she refused to surrender her infant daughter to its biological 
father and his wife a state court upheld the fathers 10000 
contract

william stern to maintain custody of the child last month 
whiteheadgould struck an agreement with stern giving her 
liberalized visitation rights 
the case is the subject of the madefortelevision film baby

the supreme court agreed monday to study the 
power of states to regulate natural gas production including 
useitorloseit rules designed to stimulate production 
the court will review a ruling that upheld the power of kansas 
officials to control production from what is believed to be the 
largest natural gas reservoir in the world the justices are not 
expected to decide the case until 1989 
the kansas supreme court in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the 
kansas corporation commission that officials said would encourage 
production prevent economic and physical waste and protect the 
rights of producers 
at issue is gas from the hugoton field which extends across 
portions of kansas oklahoma and texas about twothirds of the 
field is in kansas containing some 4000 wells as of 1983 most of 
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines 
the kansas corporation commission since 1944 imposed rules aimed 
at assuring that each well will ultimately produce approximately 
the amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder 
the idea was to treat well owners equally since gas can migrate 
underground from an underproducing area to a well that is 
overproducing 
to assure equal treatment the state fixed the maximum amount of 
gas that can be produced per month from each well 
in practice wells cannot always be operated to meet monthly 
ceilings for various reasons for example a well may be shut in or 
there may be low demand in a given month and therefore the well 
underproduces 
to allow for these variables state officials permitted owners 
of underproducing wells to save up their production ceilings 
creating what are called underages and overproduce in future 
months to make up for shortfalls 
to create a production incentive the kansas commission changed 
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within 
specified periods of years or they would be canceled 
the useitorloseit rule was challenged by northwest central 
pipeline corp one of the major buyers of the hugoton gas for 
transport outside the state 
northwest central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from 
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to by contract the 
pipeline company said cancellation of the underages means that it 
unfairly may lose reservoirs of gas when they migrate underground 
and later are replaced by other migrating supplies 
the pipeline company asked the supreme court to strike down the 
1983 regulations on grounds that the federal energy regulatory 
commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production 
the reagan administration sided with kansas officials in urging 
the high court not to disturb the kansas supreme court ruling 
the justice department said the kansas commission lawfully is 
regulating production and is not directly regulating the interstate 
pipeline companies that are subject to federal authority 
the department said the kansas case is distinct from a decision 
by the supreme court in 1986 that added a new limitation on states 
power to regulate natural gas prices 
the court said then that mississippi may not require an 
interstate pipeline to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool 
when the pipeline had preexisting contracts with only some of the 
owners 
the case acted on monday is northwest central pipeline vs 
kansas 861856

the soviet parliament endorsed the 
intermediaterange nuclear missile treaty monday but a top official 
said the kremlin should not ratify the superpower agreement before 
the us senate does 
members of the foreign affairs committees of the supreme 
soviets two chambers met in a brief joint session to unanimously 
endorse the treaty and send it to the presidium the highest 
executive body for ratification 
president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev signed the pact to 
destroy us and soviet medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
on dec 8 in washington they begin another summit sunday in moscow 
and hope the treaty will be ratified before it ends 
yegor k ligachev no 2 in the kremlin to gorbachev presided 
at the meeting of about 20 committee members it was the 
culmination of a process begun feb 9 when foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze appeared before lawmakers to speak for the treaty 
by approving ratification the committees set the stage for 
final action by the presidium which ratifies international 
agreements 
soviet ratification has been considered certain because the 
treaty was endorsed by the politburo supreme body of the communist 
party and signed by gorbachev who is both communist party chief 
and a presidium member 
soviet officials have acknowldged however that they want the 
formal ratification processes in both countries to proceed 
together the senate is not expected to act on the treaty this week 
viktor p karpov head of the foreign ministry arms control and 
disarmament desk told western reporters his country should not 
ratify the treaty before the united states 
i think it depends on the decision of the us senate he 
said at the end of the committee meeting which lasted just over an 
hour i think we should wait for the decision to be made we 
should be sure that we are not alone 
the soviets have said past us actions on arms control treaties 
made them wary of moving too rapidly with ratification of the 
latest agreement 
in 1979 the washington and moscow signed salt ii setting limits 
on longrange nuclear weapons president jimmy carter withdrew it 
from senate consideration after the soviets sent soldiers into 
afghanistan in december of that year 
karpov said endorsement by the supreme soviet committees showed 
his country supports the treaty and declared we are ready to 
ratify it and they have recommended to the presidium of the 
supreme soviet to ratify it 
tuesday is opening day for the regular spring session of the 
1500member supreme soviet but there has been no official 
indication it will act on the treaty a vote by the full membership 
is not needed for ratification 
anatoly f dobrynin communist party foreign affairs secretary 
and former ambassador to washington expressed hope at the 
committee meeting that the senate would act on the treaty before 
the summit 
dobrynin attended the meeting as chairman of the foreign affairs 
commission of the soviet of nationalties ligachev chairs the 
equivalent committee in the other chamber the soviet of the union 
a member of the senate armed services committee said earlier 
monday that us ratification during the summit remains possible 
but some senators still have questions about the treaty 
sen william cohen a maine republican told cbs news that three 
conservative republicans still want to debate some issues and that 
will take a good part of this week to conclude 
at least 67 votes in the 100member senate are required for 
ratification 
on april 20 a commission created by the two committees of the 
supreme soviet recommended ratification 
its chairman georgi m kornienko said at the monday meeting 
the treaty would remove two links of the nuclear chain that have 
circled our mother earth

voters in several resort communities 
decide tuesday whether to form a new city to be called lake tahoe 
a measure opposed by casinos but favored by residents demanding 
more for their taxes 
the new city with a population of about 6500 would embrace 
the gambling resort of stateline and would be situated along 15 
miles of lake tahoes southeastern shore 
fewer than 3000 registered voters in the tahoe township of 
douglas county are expected to go to the polls tuesday to decide on 
the measure which has generated some 20 years of debate hearings 
and court battles 
if the plan is approved another election will be held to 
organize the government 
proponents of the new city say the lakeshore communities 
comprise nearly 25 percent of the countys population while 
contributing 60 percent of the tax revenue they say they do not 
receive a proportionate share in services 
we want to keep our tax dollars here said bill bigham a 
leader of the movement to create the city lake tahoe nev 
ron nino leader of the opposition said a city government will 
only raise taxes without a corresponding improvement in services 
the opposition has received financial support from the stateline 
casinos whose tax burden nino said would rise by at least 300000 
yearly under a city government what will they get for it not 
much he added 
douglas county commissioners also advised against the idea 
the county has said it stands to lose about 18 million in 
yearly tax revenue most of it from the big stateline casinos if 
voters approve the plan because property and gaming taxes will 
shift from the county to city 
the plan also produced an unsuccessful challenge in state court 
last year and complaints from communities in california on the 
western side of the lake that the name lake tahoe would create 
confusion in the public mind between lake tahoe the lake and lake 
tahoe the city 
the new city which would embrace such communities as glenbrook 
zephyr cove round hill cave rock and marla bay couldnt start 
its business before july 1 1989

several iranian warships conducted 
maneuvers monday in the strait of hormuz apparently trying to show 
continued readiness despite recent losses 
five us warships destined for duty in the persian gulf passed 
through the suez canal on monday the destroyer john hancock and 
missile frigates fahrion halyburton nicholas and robert g 
bradley are to replace a missile cruiser and four frigates at the 
end of this month 
gulf shipping executives said a large iranian vessel that may 
have been a destroyer two frigates and a landing craft were seen 
near irans naval base at bandar abbas 
they said the ships could not be identified with certainty but 
the largest appeared to be a destroyer that has not been active for 
more than a year in the gulf where iran and iraq have been at war 
since september 1980 the executives spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
iran has three destroyers built during world war ii for britain 
and the united states they were modernized in the early 1970s with 
antiship and antiaircraft missiles radar and other equipment 
none has been seen in many months leading military analysts to 
speculate they were out of commission 
capt richard sharpe editor of janes fighting ships said the 
status of the former royal navy destroyer damavand was very 
doubtful but at least one and probably both former us navy 
ships were operational 
the iranians said sunday it was conducting naval exercises in 
the persian gulf gulf of oman and indian ocean it said about 50 
ships were involved including missile carrying destroyers 
destroyers missile launching frigates and personnel carriers 
their official islamic republic news agency said the maneuvers 
called zolfaqar3 would last several days it said they would 
involve land sea and air operations and the latest 
technology in sea wars including radar and radio jamming aerial 
target tracking paratroop drops mine sweeping and interception of 
air raids 
irna quoted a naval intelligence officer it did not name as 
saying the exercises were aimed at disproving us claims that it 
had crippled half the hardware of the iranian navy 
iran accused the us navy of providing assistance for iraqi 
jets that made a devastating air strike may 14 on irans larak 
island oil terminal in hormuz the narrow southern gateway to the 
gulf in which five tankers were damaged 
on apri1 18 us warships and planes sank or disabled six 
iranian naval craft in a series of clashes 
irans losses included the britishbuilt frigate sahand a fast 
attack boat and two armed speedboats sunk the frigate sabalan 
disabled and a speedboat probably sunk 
tehran has acknowledged damage to several ships including the 
sahand and sabalan and more than 40 sailors killed 
us casualties were two marine pilots killed when their ah1 
cobra helicopter gunship was lost the iranians claim they shot it 
down 
since the clashes in april the rules of engagement for us 
navy ships have been changed so they can intervene in attacks by 
iranian vessels on neutral ships in international waters 
iranian speedboats have raided two ships in hormuz in the past 
week but there have been no confrontations with the us navy 
since april 18 none of the larger iranian vessels sighted monday 
were involved in that fighting 
the only one seen previously on may 10 was the alvand a 
sister ship of the two frigates hit last month western analysts 
have said the other frigate alborz was nonoperational but senior 
navy officials said recently that both were back on duty

michael dukakis whose relations with the business 
community have been mixed during his tenure as massachussetts 
governor is not willing to concede business support to its 
traditional home in the republican party 
business leaders aligned with the democratic frontrunners 
campaign hope to sign up a minimum of 5000 executives nationwide 
for a national business coalition with group leaders appearing on 
behalf of dukakis at conventions and other events 
george bush with his entrepreneurial background and republican 
pedigree has a readymade base of support in the business arena 
but organizers of the dukakis effort to be officially announced 
when leadership roles are filled say their venture into 
traditionally republican circles has been well received because of 
dissatisfaction with the reagan administrations handling of the 
trade and budget deficits 
the conventional question about the democratic partys 
candidates is their ability to make the hard economic decisions 
the business decisions said robert farmer a wealthy businessman 
and dukakis top fundraiser for the first time in 20 years 
weve got a candidate with credibility on the economy and a record 
of fiscal responsibility 
the first phase of the effort involves recruiting professionals 
who have donated to the dukakis campaign farmer has given richard 
giesser who is organizing the coalition lists of contributors 
with business ties 
thats where you start said farmer if you already bet 2 
on a horse race youre apt to root for that horse all the way 
around the track 
giesser chairman of the massachussetts port authority declined 
to list prospective members of the group among massachusetts 
businessmen working with giesser are joe henson president of prime 
computer inc and john j cullinane the founder and president of 
computer software maker cullinet inc 
another recent addition is prominent new york businessman john 
dyson who promised to recruit 400 to 500 business officials in his 
state 
i think we will be able to organize such a group around the 
country that it will surprise people said dyson who met with 
dukakis at the massachusetts statehouse last week much of the 
republican party takes business for granted he said 
norman ornstein a political analyst at the american enterprise 
institute in washington termed it unlikely that dukakis could pull 
support of a majority of top business leaders 
but i think youre going to find that dukakis is going to have 
some success in getting serious business support he said it 
can help hes running the umbrella type campaign and trying to 
keep the umbrella as big as possible the more support he gets from 
credible people in business and other groups the more credence 
people will give to his message 
hensen and cullinane are among dukakis top business backers in 
massachusetts proponents of publicprivate partnerships that 
dukakis has promoted to steer companies to economically struggling 
areas of the state 
many other hightech officials have long battled dukakis on 
issues ranging from state spending to environmental policy and 
small businessmen lately have criticized a new state law that 
requires most employers to give workers health insurance by 1992 
even his detractors believe dukakis will have at least limited 
success in lining up business support 
weve been saying for some time that he has been 
overspending said howard foley chairman of the massachusetts 
high technology council but how many business people in texas or 
california or illinois or pennsylvania are really going to care 
about that 
the council was established in 1977 near the end of dukakis 
first term as governor by high tech executives dissatisfied with 
dukakis record on taxes and economic development lobbying 
pressure from the influential group led to several economic 
development programs that dukakis now touts on the campaign trail 
members of the hightech group also have complained that dukakis 
takes too much credit for the state economy 
but foley said the socalled massachusetts miracle and 
political momentum will attract business officials to dukakis 
business and labor and every other constituency will be 
anxious to be with a winner foley said thats human nature

students hurling firebombs and rocks 
attacked a us diplomatic office monday as thousands of 
demonstrators battled riot police for a sixth consecutive day in 
the southern city of kwangju 
the attack did not damage the singlestory us information 
service building 
police said they fired tear gas to thwart the attack by bands of 
students shouting antius slogans and hurling firebombs at the 
building in the provincial city 165 miles south of seoul 
at least four policemen were reported injured 
the korean news agency yonhap said police arrested two 
protesters who scaled the roof of an annex to the usis building and 
tossed five firebombs that smashed several rooftiles but caused no 
fire 
a student was seen unfolding an antius placard at the top of 
a nearby building while another 100 students surged out of 
sidestreets to hurl rocks and about 30 firebombs that exploded 
around the gate and walls of the usis office 
also on monday groups of students attacked four police stations 
in kwangju smashing windows and doors before being driven off 
clashes between police and some 1000 protesters also broke out in 
downtown kwangju after dark the agency said 
the firebomb attack followed demonstrations monday at kwangjus 
chonnam university where police fired barrages of tear gas to stop 
about 3000 students and dissidents trying to march off campus 
down with the military dictatorship and drive out the 
yankees the demonstrators shouted as they called for a full 
investigation into the south korean armys bloody suppression of a 
1980 uprising in kwangju in which about 200 people were killed 
thousands of demonstrators have clashed with police in kwangju 
since rallies began wednesday marking the eighth anniversary of the 
uprising 
antius sentiment has been running high in the recent wave of 
protests with students demanding the removal of all us influence 
the us government has denied any involvement in the kwangju 
incident but dissidents contend the united states condoned the 
movement of south korean soldiers to suppress the protests under a 
mutual defense pact the united states controls both korean troops 
and 42000 us soldiers stationed here 
last week protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the 
usis building in seoul and hurled home made bombs at the us 
embassy a policeman and two students were hurt in the incident 
but other parts of south korea were reported quiet monday after 
five days of antigovernment demonstrations that often turned into 
violent clashes with riot police in the streets and on campuses

a rum warehouse converted into a new 
tate gallery of modern art opens tuesday as the crown jewel in the 
revived waterfront of this economically depressed port city 
prince charles accepted liverpools invitation to open the 
tate of the north a permanent gallery housing more than 200 
20th century works of art from londons tate gallery 
the princes visit is symbolic of the turnaround in our 
city said keith robinson director of liverpool chamber of 
commerce 
we have been hit hard and we are delighted that his royal 
highness is coming here just as the tide is starting to flow 
economically again in liverpools direction he said in an 
interview 
the tate is on 140yearold albert dock in the city that was 
founded on american and caribbean trade in cotton tobacco sugar 
rum and african slaves 
it is named after its victorian benefactor sugar cane magnate 
sir henry tate a liverpudlian whose sugar was imported through the 
docks 
the new northern gallery is the first endeavor by a state museum 
in britain to show its works on a large scale outside the capital 
city 
we will change the displays and exhibitions every nine months 
and i expect half a million visitors a year said curator richard 
francis the aim has been to take works out of storage and put 
them in a place where they would be of benefit 
the first displays include surrealist art such as salvador 
dalis lobster telephone british sculpture of the past 20 
years and a room of abstract paintings by the late american mark 
rothko 
i am absolutely delighted at this move said sir alan 
bowness who directs the tate gallery holdings of 40000 works 
representing all british art and international 20th century art 
our space in london is large enough to show only about 15 
percent of our modern art because modern art works tend to be big 
and liverpool will raise that to 25 percent 
the international council of the museum of modern art in new 
york visited liverpool on saturday to see how the fivestory 
warehouse of red bricks and stone supported by castiron columns 
was converted at a cost of nearly 14 million by architect james 
stirling 
it was filthy and ruinous when i saw it with dead pigeons 
lying everywhere the roof collapsed and water pouring in 
stirling said i was glad to work on it as it is perhaps the 
most magnificent dock of its type ever built in this country 
said gallery staffer sarah hughes 23 my friends here have a 
bit of a giggle about modern art which is an unknown quantity in 
liverpool 
but theres a great spirit of pride in this city and not just 
because were the beatles hometown we all want to get involved in 
helping it she added 
government and business moved to help liverpool with millions of 
pounds in cash grants in 1977 after the decline of the docks 
shipbuilding and automaking 
investment expanded after 1981 riots by the unemployed in the 
toxteth district led to one death 3000 arrests and streets of 
homes and shops set ablaze 
the city of 476500 people still has a jobless rate of 25 
percent and is having to overcome a history of strikes and leftist 
political anarchy on the city council 
keynote of the revival is the transformation of the 
onceabandoned city center docks along the mersey river into a 
leisure area of museums shops offices apartments and businesses 
the first sign we had that things were changing was one year 
ago when employers reported shortages of skilled workers said 
robinson 
the docks are busy again because european businessmen are 
realizing that liverpool is still the nearest port to the united 
states

the national cancer institute said monday it 
will try to double over the next four years the number of patients 
who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed up the 
search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers 
largely because of physicians reluctance to enroll their 
patients in cancer experiments officials said it may take 10 
years or longer to assess the value of promising new therapies 
we are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of 
patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of 
time dr vincent t devita jr director of the cancer 
institute said at a meeting of the american society of clinical 
oncology 
currently about 25000 cancer patients each year are enrolled 
in treatment experiments known as clinical trials that are 
sponsored by the cancer institute 
through appeals to doctors and directly to the public the 
institute hopes to double this by 1992 
clinical trials are medicines primary way of figuring out 
whether new drugs and combinations of surgery and radiation are 
better than the standard ways of coping with the disease 
typically patients are randomly assigned to have the standard 
treatment or the new form of therapy 
only about 1 percent of patients with colon or breast cancer are 
currently enrolled in clinical trials devita said the institute 
hopes to increase this to 10 percent 
the goal is to enroll all the patients who will take part in an 
experiment within one year instead of over three five or even 10 
years as often now happens once patients are enrolled doctors 
must wait five years to see which treatment worked best 
devita said patients are often worried about taking part in 
cancer experiments 
the public is confused he said they think they are 
guinea pigs that they will get nothing and well just watch their 
tumors grow thats not the case 
instead devita maintained that participants in clinical trials 
get the best available treatment even if they are assigned to the 
comparison group that doesnt get the experimental therapy 
however experts said that the unwillingness of doctors not 
patients is the primary obstacle to increasing the number of 
patients in clinical trials 
dr bernard fisher of the university of pittsburgh who has been 
conducting clinical trials since the 1950s said doctors often want 
to stick with the style of care they learned in medical school and 
are also afraid they will lose control of their patients 
treatments 
dr robert e wittes head of the cancer institutes cancer 
therapy evaluation program added the main problem of 
participating in trials is that they take time 
he said physicians are reluctant to spend time explaining the 
treatment trials to their patients and keeping up with the paper 
work involved 
another study presented at the conference suggested that many 
doctors believe they already know what kind of treatment is best 
dr malcolm j moore of princess margaret hospital in toronto 
surveyed 300 physicians in north american and england who treat 
cancer of the bladder kidneys and prostate gland seventy percent 
responded that if they had one of these kinds of cancer they would 
not enroll themselves in a clinical trial instead they would 
prefer the kind of therapy they already offer their patients 
wittes said the cancer institute is trying to appeal to doctors 
sense of public duty 
we are saying you will do good for society and you will do 
good for your patients 
wittes said the cancer institute will concentrate at first in 
enrolling more patients in clinical trials of new treatments for 
nonhodgkins lymphoma and cancers of the breast colon rectum and 
bladder

against a backdrop of nearly 200 police 
officers gov william donald schaefer signed a law monday making 
maryland the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as 
saturday night specials 
this is the first time a legislature has stood up and said 
these guns are wrong the governor said he said the measure is 
a step toward stopping the senseless killing on our streets 
looking on was white house press secretary james brady who was 
wounded by a saturday night special in the 1981 assassination 
attempt on president reagan by john w hinckley jr bradys wife 
sarah had lobbied for the bill 
id like to see other states like dominoes fall into line 
said brady who has been in a wheelchair since the shooting 
thumbs up for maryland 
i cant think of a sweeter more wonderful day this is indeed 
a great step for public safety said mrs brady 
in the last 20 years saturday night specials have been used to 
kill 250000 people and injure 1 million she said 
the law makes it illegal after jan 1 1990 to sell or 
manufacture a saturday night special in maryland it will not be 
against the law to own such weapons 
the measure also sets up a ninemember board appointed by the 
governor to prepare a list of handguns that may be sold weapons 
that are easily concealed inaccurate unsafe and poorly made will 
be banned under the law 
the bill also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be 
slipped through metal detectors 
nearly 200 uniformed police officers from maryland 
pennsylvania delaware virginia and west virginia witnessed the 
signing in an effort by the governor to demonstrate wide support 
among law enforcement agencies 
gun owners backed by the national rifle association already 
are collecting signatures to put the law to a vote in a referendum 
in november 
jim goss an nra official in washington said the organization 
had no comment on the bill he referred callers to leaders of the 
maryland committee against the gun ban 
fred griisser a spokesman for the committe said he doesnt 
have a count on the number of signatures collected so far but that 
he is confident his organization will meet the requirement of 
33044 to put the bill to a vote 
after that it will be an uphill battle to explain the true 
nature of the law to the voters he said 
under the law manufacturers can be fined up to 10000 and 
dealers and gun owners up to 2500 for each violation each time a 
gun is made or sold constitutes a separate violation 
mrs brady who has been campaigning nationally for tougher gun 
laws since her husband was shot said the maryland approach solves 
the difficult problem of trying to define saturday night specials 
by leaving the decision to a review board 
the board will consist of three citizen members the 
superintendent of state police and one representative each of a 
state prosecutors association the maryland association of chiefs 
of police marylanders against handgun abuse the national rifle 
association and a maryland gun manufacturer 
other states are interested in the maryland approach and gun 
control groups are gearing up to try to pass similar laws 
elsewhere mrs brady said

a brooklynborn art scholar with the air of a 
british gentleman was sentenced monday to three years in prison for 
transporting stolen documents belonging to the national archives 
and the library of congress 
charles merrill mount 60 also was ordered to repay 20000 to 
a boston bookstore that bought some of the documents 
mount predicted he would win an appeal 
us district judge rya zobel sentenced mount to two threeyear 
prison terms but suspended the second term and instead ordered 
mount to serve five years probation after his release 
assistant us attorney martin f murphy had recommended a total 
prison sentence of eight years while defense attorney charles 
mcginty requested a suspended sentence mount who was convicted 
april 11 could have received up to 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine 
mcginty asked monday that mount be allowed to remain free long 
enough to help prepare for a trial in washington on charges of 
possessing federal property ms zobel ordered mount taken into 
custody pending her decision on the request 
before the sentence was read mount professed his innocence in a 
rambling 35minute speech to ms zobel about how he was the victim 
of libel and plagiarism by envious historians 
ms zobel told mount you continue to proclaim your innocence 
however the jury did not believe your testimony you stole 
those documents from us all those documents belong to the national 
heritage 
an art historian and a guggenheim foundation fellow at the age 
of 26 mount was accused of selling letters by james mcneill 
whistler winston churchill and henry james that belonged to the 
library of congress last july he sold the letters to goodspeeds 
book shop a boston dealer of rare books and documents 
a month later fbi agents arrested the dapper historian at the 
bookshop while he tried to sell letters and papers bearing the 
signatures of abraham lincoln and civil war generals the documents 
were taken from the national archives 
murphy said the documents had been stored in massachusetts 
during the trial but will be returned to the institutions in 
washington 
mount claimed the documents belonged to him for years and that 
he showed them to two irish men while living in dublin in the 1960s 
but his legal troubles left him broke and he couldnt afford to 
bring the witnesses to his trial he said the federal government 
seized his 18400 in savings after his arrest that money will now 
go to repay goodspeeds 
during his threeweek trial mount protested that he wasnt 
being allowed to present his side of the case he claimed he was 
being railroaded because the government would not pay to bring the 
witnesses from ireland 
despite having a britishsounding accent mount started in life 
as sherman merrill suchow of brooklyn ny he changed his name in 
the 1950s

a proposed change in federal regulations would 
hold farmers and others in the marketing chain financially 
accountable for livestock carcasses condemned at slaughter plants 
because of illegally high traces of drugs the agriculture 
department said monday 
bh bill jones administrator of the departments packers 
and stockyards administration said the proposal is intended to 
deter the sale of medicated aniamls for slaughter and shift 
economic responsibility for illegal drug residues from the meat 
packer to those who cause the violation 
under the proposal a meat packer would be able to bill back 
the person from whom the livestock was bought if it is condemned 
because of illegal drug residues 
in order to make the plan work jones said each purchaser or 
selling agency in the marketing chain would be permitted to use the 
billback procedure if a seller failed to settle up the buyer or 
selling agency would be permitted to deduct from a subsequent 
purchase from the same person 
jones said that although a small percentage of livestock 
producers are selling medicated animals for slaughter the 
illegally high drug residues continue to be a problem notably in 
swine culled dairy cows and young calves 
the proposal will be open 60 days for public comment those can 
be sent to packers and stockyards administration room 3039s

a navy and coast guard review began 
monday of proposed changes in an airsea rescue training program 
suspended since the march 2 drowning of a recruit 
six sailors accused in the drowning also face a public hearing 
wednesday as navy officials denied charges by the mans family that 
they were slow to investigate his death airman recruit lee 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis died while allegedly held in the 
pool by instructors 
the review of recommended changes at the rescue swimmer school 
is closed to the public said lt cmdr dennis hessler a spokesman 
for vice adm nr thunman 
the school at the pensacola naval air station had a 40 percent 
attrition rate and already was under study prior to the death said 
thunman chief of naval education and training he added that such 
high rates often mean we havent put the right people there and 
we havent prepared them properly for training 
mirecki died after instructors allegedly dragged him into a pool 
against his will and held his head under water after he failed a 
drill 
other recruits reportedly were told to turn their backs to the 
pool and sing the starspangled banner as loudly as they could 
to drown out mireckis screams for help 
family members say they were told mireckis death was an 
accident and navy records in washington initially attributed his 
death to natural causes they complain that they had to wait two 
months before getting any official word on how he died 
the five instructors were charged with involuntary manslaughter 
and conspiracy to commit battery their commanding officer was 
charged with dereliction of duty 
the wednesday hearing is the militarys equivalent to a grand 
jury inquiry though some differences exist including it being 
open to the public 
lt lee saunders a public affairs officer said portions of the 
hearing might be closed for legal reasons however 
the presiding officer cmdr daniel j dalesio of the naval 
legal service office in philadelphia will recommend whether the 
charges should go to courtmartial be dismissed or handled through 
nonjudicial penalties 
the accused sailors could be dismissed from the service if they 
are found guilty at a courtmartial those charged with involuntary 
manslaughter also could be imprisoned up three years their 
commander could face three months

she called the film a whitewashed depiction of the surrogate 
agreement and ensuing battle in new jersey courts that made her the 
nations bestknown surrogate 
she said she was particularly upset by the films shallow 
portrayal of her exhusband richard whitehead 
the whiteheads were divorced this year and mary beth whitehead 
married dean gould the couple had a child earlier this month 
whiteheadgould gained fame after she refused to surrender her 
infant daughter to its biological father william stern also of 
new jersey 
stern and his wife sued and a new jersey state court last year 
upheld the contract under which whiteheadgould accepted a 10000 
fee to bear sterns child 
the contract was voided in february by the state supreme court 
although the court let the sterns keep the child they named 
melissa whiteheadgould has visitation rights 
the madefortelevision film stars jobeth williams as 
whiteheadgould the film based entirely on court records was 
made without the cooperation of whiteheadgould or the sterns

britain on monday welcomed the first soviet 
delegation to visit a chemical warfare facility in western europe 
thirteen soviet scientists and military experts will spend three 
days inspecting britains chemical warfare defense center and 
related facilities in southwestern england and talking with british 
chemical weapons experts 
britain stopped making chemical weapons in the 1950s and 
destroyed its stockpiles in 1957 
the ministry of defense said it will be the first exchange visit 
on chemical weapons between the soviet union and a western european 
country 
it is intended that the full range of chemical warfarerelated 
issues should be discussed including production assessment of 
the chemical warfare hazards storage trials detection 
protection monitoring decontamination medical countermeasures 
and disposal said ian stewart minister of state for the armed 
forces 
the visiting delegation is led by yuri nazarkin the chief 
soviet negotiatior at the geneva conference on disarmament and 
includes maj gen rf razuvanov commander of the soviet chemical 
establishment in shikhany located on the volga in eastern russia 
the soviets will visit the chemical warfare defense center at 
porton down which sprawls across 7000 acres on salisbury plain 
near the ancient stonehenge monument about 80 miles southwest of 
london 
since britains stockpiles have been destroyed porton down now 
does only defensive work making protective equipment such as gas 
masks clothing and monitoring instruments for the armed forces and 
developing antidotes to chemical weapons 
the soviets also will visit the nearby public health laboratory 
service center where applied microbiological research is 
conducted and the united kingdom defense nuclear biological and 
chemical center where instructors are trained to use defensive 
equipment to counter chemical weapons 
in return british scientists will in july visit the soviet 
chemical warfare facility in shikhany 
britain proposed the exchange in 1986 before the soviets 
acknowledged that they possess chemical weapons 
in early 1987 the soviets conceded they have a chemical weapons 
stockpile amounting to 50000 tons and accepted the british 
invitation later that year western estimates however put the 
soviet stockpile at 300000 tons the largest in the world 
britain which has been in the forefront of negotiations to 
achieve a worldwide ban on chemical weapons said last week that 
such a ban as well as reductions in conventional forces must come 
before any further negotiations on cutting nuclear weapons in 
europe 
the united states the only other country that acknowledges 
possessing chemical weapons ended an 18year moratorium on their 
manufacture in december and has an estimated stockpile of 30000 
tons 
the massive soviet stockpile has been a major stumbling block at 
the 40nation geneva conference a 1925 geneva protocol bans the 
use of chemical arms

an additional 3375367 acres of highly 
erodible cropland will be taken from production under the 10year 
conservation reserve program the agriculture department said 
monday 
milton hertz administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation program said the acreage was 
accepted from offers or bids during the programs sixth signup 
held feb 119 a total of about 45 million acres was offered 
during the signup 
in all counting the earlier signups more than 255 million 
acres have been accepted into the program he said another signup 
will be held july 18 through aug 5 
congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 
million acres for the program by 1990 
under the program farmers agree to take land from production 
for 10 years in return based on bids they submit they get annual 
rental payments from the government and onetime assistance pay for 
half the cost of planting grass trees and shrubs to guard against 
erosion 
hertz said the bids accepted from the latest signup averaged 
4790 per acre annually compared with 4845 for the first five 
signups

nationalization of foreign oil companies and an end to what they 
call the armys dirty war against them 
the military said leftist guerrillas organized the protests 
there have been 20 peasant marches in colombia in the last year 
this is the first time the protests were aimed at foreign oil 
companies 
there are approximately 30 such companies here 
newspapers and radio chains with reporters accompanying the 
peasants estimated the total number of protesters as about 80000

army threw a bomb and hijacked a bus in the northwest city of 
medellin police there reported 
a police release said little damage was caused by the bomb 
explosion sunday night at the medellin headquarters of a banana 
plantation owners association 
banana growers and banana pickers have been at odds for months 
rightwing death squads have killed 95 workers the national 
liberation army known as the eln has killed 10 workers believed 
to be army informants 
eln guerrillas hijacked a busload of workers in medellin on 
monday but freed everyone and fled after harranguing the 
passengers the police said 
defense minister gen rafael samudio molina said in an interview 
with the radio chain rcn that mondays peasant protests were 
organized by the eln 
the eln demands that foreign oil companies get out of colombia 
and that the government nationalize their holdings 
the guerrilla group has bombed the countrys main oil pipeline 
two dozen times this year 
the line runs 500 miles from bogotas biggest oil field on the 
venezuelan border in northern arauca province to the caribbean 
port of covenas 
as in past protests the peasants claimed that the army is 
behind death squads that have killed hundreds of people in the last 
two years 
death squads killed about 800 members of a leftist party the 
patriotic union during that time in the last two months death 
squads killed more than 150 peasants including those in the 
bananagrowing regions for alleged sympathy with leftist 
guerrillas

the value of us agricultural exports to the 
soviet union this year is expected to be at a threeyear high of 
14 billion up 50 percent from 938 million in calendar 1987 the 
agriculture department said monday 
behind the gain will be much larger wheat shipments at higher 
prices and much bigger soybean and soybean meal sales the 
departments economic research service said 
farm product sales to the soviets exceeded 19 billion in 1985 
but plummeted to a 13yearlow of 658 million in 1986 before 
starting their rebound 
a major factor has been large sales of us wheat at subsidized 
prices under the departments export enhancement program 
the us value share of soviet grain imports may be above 30 
percent for the first time since 1984 and may comprise over 8 
percent of total agricultural imports the report said 
although total soviet agricultural imports may increase 5 
percent in 1988 from last years estimated 16 billion the value 
still will be below the 19 billion average during the first half 
of the 1980s 
grain imports now cost about 3 billion a year instead of 7 
billion as in 198185 the report said despite a possible 20 
percent rise in the perton cost of imported grain in 1988 this 
unit value will still be around onethird lower in the early 
1980s 
earlier this month the usda forecast 1988 soviet grain output 
at 215 million metric tons up 2 percent from last year it also 
would be the third consecutive harvest of more than 200 millon 
tons a historic first for the soviet union 
crops are off to a much better start than in 1987 following a 
good fall sowing overwintering and spring planting conditions 
mondays analysis said barring unusually severe weather through 
the spring and fall 1988 crop output should increase

it will take up to two months to complete the 
trial of a professor accused of the chain saw murder of a teenage 
male prostitute whose body parts were scattered across the state 
potential jurors were told monday 
max bernard franc 58 who taught political science at fresno 
state university but maintained an apartment in west hollywood has 
denied killing the 18yearold runaway blaming a man who has never 
been found 
the trial is expected to offer insight into the plight of young 
runaways in the west hollywood gay community 
superior court judge john h reid told 70 prospective jurors 
francs trial could last as long as eight weeks 
some have referred to this as the chain saw case the judge 
told the prospects and informed them that body parts had been found 
in various locations in california 
he instructed them not to read anything further about the case 
the victim tracy leroy nute of kansas city mo was 18 when 
he died on aug 20 he had left home the previous february telling 
his mother that he was headed for california to become a movie star 
after his arrival he bleached his dark hair blond and wore it 
in spikes counselors in the gay community said nute turned to them 
for help after his dreams of stardom faded and he wound up working 
as a homosexual prostitute 
franc a bespectacled professor originally from de pere wis 
was arrested aug 29 after he returned a chain saw to a west 
hollywood rental company with bits of flesh and blood in its inner 
workings 
police alleged that the saw was used to cut up nutes body 
which was found in pieces scattered across a 200mile area some 
parts of the body were never found 
in early interviews with police franc claimed that nute was 
murdered by another man terry adams but no such person was ever 
located and a prosecutor contends the man was invented by franc 
if convicted franc could face life imprisonment

the us fish and wildlife service has decided 
to allow an ohio zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas on loan 
from china while zoo officials work to produce the required export 
papers the service said monday 
last week the agency said the toledo zoo would not be allowed 
to display the pandas until it could provide the original export 
permit the zoo which has scheduled to open the panda exhibit 
tuesday was given 10 days to come up with the documentation 
however usfws spokesman david klinger said monday that lawyers 
for the zoo gave the service a copy of the chinese export permit 
over the weekend and appear to be making a goodfaith effort to 
deliver the original document 
were not going to stand in the way of them opening their 
exhibit this week klinger said they appear to be making an 
effort to deliver the documents well accept that in good faith 
from them as a first step well allow them to open as they want 
however klinger said the zoo still will be required to provide 
the originals by may 29 zoo officials have said they have a 
representative in china working on getting the documents to the 
service 
zoo spokeswoman patty napierala confirmed that the zoo had 
gotten the green light to open the exhibit and plans to do so at 
noon tuesday 
the zoo has spent nearly 3 million in preparing to exhibit the 
pandas as part of toledos 150th anniversary celebration 
in a bid to stop the exhibit the world wildlife fund filed suit 
against the wildlife service arguing that the exhibit would 
violate an international convention that bars trafficking in 
endangered species for commercial purposes 
klinger said toledo zoo officials had sought unsuccessfully to 
be exempted from the convention on endangered species and had filed 
an exemption form with the service instead of the full export 
permit as required 
when the pandas arrived in chicago on may 13 the paperwork had 
not been corrected klinger said the service decided it would be 
best for the pandas to allow them to go on to toledo and to take up 
the issue later

members of congress and family members on 
monday urged the soviet union to allow mathematician benjamin 
charny to emigrate to the united states for medical resons 
the reason they refuse to let him go is ludicrous said 
charneys daughter ann charnyblank of brookline mass officially 
charny is being denied emigration because of work he did 17 years 
ago on the soviets rocket reentry system she said 
charney 50 has a serious heart condition which cardiologists 
in the soviet union say make removal of two tumors on his neck and 
thyroid gland too risky she said western physicians who examined 
charny said the necessary surgery would be routine if conducted in 
the west 
the tumor on charneys neck which reportedly doubles in size 
every few months is now 35 inches in diameter and threatens to 
block nerves and arteries to the brain mrs charnyblank said at a 
news conference 
noting the move to sign a ussoviet agreement on a joint 
mission to mars as a sign of trust mrs charnyblank said it 
is especially ridiculous under these circumstances to claim that my 
fathers work is still secret 
it looks as if the soviets are planning to fly to mars 
together with the americans but return separately since they still 
consider the work of my father on the return to earth to be a 
secret she said 
i cannot understand it she said my only hope is that 
with this coming summit responding to all the indignation of 
people in america and all over the world during the summit that 
my fathers case will finally be resolved and this race against 
time will finally be over 
mrs charnyblank who was allowed to emmigrate with her husband 
and daughter last fall was joined at the news conference by reps 
barney frank dmass and louis stokes dohio 
a group of children from nearby falls church va presented 
part of 15000 letters from american schoolchildren and one signed 
by more than 100 members of congress on charnys behalf 
reps frank and stokes said the reagan administration had been 
supportive of charnys bid for emigration but they noted the 
soviets had the last word 
it has been our experience that often they wont tell you a 
thing frank said but if you keep trying and you keep talking 
it does have an effect 
frank and mrs charnyblank met with the soviet counsel general 
later monday to discuss her fathers case 
following the 30minute meeting mrs charnyblank said the 
general counsel told me he wished he didnt have to discuss 
these cases because it was not his decision to make but he would 
send the information to moscow as soon as possible 
he didnt say this but i think the situation makes them 
uncomfortable she said

acid rain probably has acidified a small 
number of streams in the midatlantic states where surface waters 
previously had not been proven vulnerable according to an 
unreleased study by the environmental protection agency 
four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 in 
midatlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristics 
that made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from natural 
sources the study concluded on forested ridges inland from 
coastal lowlands the proportion reached 10 percent 
the lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in these 
streams makes it likely that their acidity is probably 
associated with atmospheric acid deposition said the study made 
available by the agency on monday 
more than a quarter of the stream mileage showing these chemical 
characteristics in epas study of eastern streams was outside the 
midatlantic but most of that was in florida where streams are 
often naturally acidic there was practically no such mileage in 
the southeast or the ozark mountains of arkansas and oklahoma 
courtney riordan head of acid rain research for epa said the 
new findings show there has been an expansion of the geographic 
area known to be influenced by acid rain 
what the study could not show is definite proof that acid rain 
has acidified the streams in question how fast stream acidity and 
acidneutralizing ability is changing or when it is likely the 
watershed no longer will be able to neutralize the acidity 
naturally epa hopes to be able to answer such questions next year 
the midatlantic area in the study was made up of rural areas of 
most of virginia and pennsylvania all of maryland delaware and 
new jersey the eastern half of west virginia and the catskill 
mountains of new york 
an acidic stream was defined as one that had lost all ability to 
neutralize further inputs of acidity 
some of the heaviest deposition of acidity in rain and snow was 
found in southern and southwestern pennsylvania northeastern west 
virginia and the maryland panhandle 
these areas and their robust soils believed to have plenty of 
ability to neutralize acid rain have not attracted the attention 
of areas with somewhat less acidity in the rain but more vulnerable 
watersheds like parts of new england the adirondack mountains of 
new york and eastern canada 
most of the acidity in rain snow and fog in the area is 
believed to originate in emissions from smokestacks of coalfired 
power plants in the area and also upwind in the midwest sulfur 
dioxide in the smokestack gases is transformed in the atmosphere 
into sulfuric acid which is washed out in precipitation 
the more acidic the water the less fish life it can support 
and too much acidity means no fish can live there what 
environmentalists say has happened in many lakes in the northeast 
and eastern canada 
there are several sources of sulfates and the sampling scheme 
excluded streams that were likely to have been influenced by 
sources in urban pollution or mine runoff 
about onethird of the 4 percent of stream mileage in question 
had chemistry influenced but not dominated by organic compounds 
originating in the soil and most of these stream segments were 
located in the pine barrens of new jersey or were headwaters of 
streams in the relatively flat glaciated soils of pennsylvania and 
new york 
historic data suggests that streams in the pine barrens may 
have been naturally acidic at least since the early 1900s the 
study said there is no reason however to believe that most of 
the upland forested reaches have always been acidic 
overall the study concluded that 27 percent of the stream 
mileage sampled was acidic including 12 percent of the florida 
streams

american envoy vernon walters said monday the 
united states will continue pushing for an arms embargo on iran 
unless it accepts a un resolution calling for a ceasefire in the 
war with iraq 
walters the us ambassador to the united nations spoke to 
reporters before flying to oman the fifth stop on a tour that also 
has taken him to israel syria and iraq 
omani officials would not comment on the purpose of the visit 
saying only that it would last two days and they would discuss 
unrelated issues 
in kuwait the ambassador praised the governments refusal to 
free convicted terrorists despite pressures that included the 
hijacking of a kuwait airways jumbo jet and the killing of two 
passengers 
the release of 17 jailed terrorists convicted of bombing the 
us and french embassies in 1983 was the hijackers only demand 
during the 16day hijack last month kuwait refused to free them 
and the hijackers surrendered the plane in algiers in return for 
safe conduct 
release of the 17 also has been the main demand of proiranian 
shiite moslehfxtremists holding nine american hostages in lebanon 
walters met with kuwaits emir sheik jaber ahmed sabah crown 
prince saad abdullah sabah and rashed abdelaziz rashed minister 
of state for cabinet affairs 
asked whether he and the kuwaitis discussed the hijacking and 
several terrorist bombings in the sheikdom he said the united 
states thinks that the kuwaiti government demonstrated great 
courage during the recent hijacking 
we are not here to make a deal about terrorists and in no way 
will the united states ever bring any kind of pressure on the 
kuwaiti government he said in reference to the hostages in 
lebanon 
asked about security council measure of last july 20 calling for 
a truce in the iraniraq war which began in septmmer 1980

defense minister yitzhak rabin on monday denied 
an american newspaper report that israel helped develop 
surfacetosurface missiles that china sold to saudi arabia 
the report in the washington post quoted us commercial sources 
and saudi experts as saying israeli scientists refined the guidance 
system used in chinas mediumrange css2 missile 
it became known two months ago that saudi arabia had bought and 
deployed css2s which have a range of 2200 miles and could reach 
any target in israel 
washington did not known of the deal in advance and could not 
persuade the saudis to cancel it 
rabin said on israel radio israelis were never partners in 
the transfer of technology or anything related to 
groundtoground missiles to china if anyone is looking for an 
alibi about how the united states was taken by surprise by a 
friendly nation saudi arabia and is trying to pin the blame on 
israel let him look elsewhere 
saudi leaders told the united states they bought the missiles to 
defend themselves against iran and pledged not to launch them at 
israel 
in march an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir hinted that 
israel might attack and destroy the missiles 
israel and china do not have diplomatic relations but there have 
been reports of increasing agricultural and business links between 
the two nations 
an israeli newspaper said last july a joint company had been 
formed to help china with agricultural and technological projects

the federal judge who was gunned down at his 
suburban home had ignored warnings from his staff to take his 
address out of the phone book telling them its fate if 
they really want you theyll find you 
the sevenyear sexual harassment and job discrimination suit of 
carolee koster came to district judge richard j daronco in his 
first year on the federal bench after he ruled against her her 
angered father tracked the judge down and killed him and then 
killed himself a few feet away officials said 
the gunman was identified as charles l koster a retired new 
york city police officer 
i knew it was related to this case it was just a feeling i 
had karen stefflre one of daroncos two law clerks said 
monday describing her thoughts when she heard that the judge had 
been killed 
i knew as soon as i heard i knew she said fighting back 
tears during an interview with reporters in daroncos chambers 
the only thing that threw me off was that he the gunman killed 
himself 
ms stefflre said she and other members of the judges staff 
urged him to remove his listing in the telephone directory but he 
shrugged it off saying its fate you cant really hide if 
they really want you theyll find you 
another law clerk christopher forte said the judge rode public 
transportation from pelham the affluent westchester county 
community where he lived to the federal courthouse in lower 
manhattan 
he would talk to anyone said forte 
james c esposito deputy assistant director in the fbis new 
york office said sunday that koster left a suicide note expressing 
strong displeasure at daroncos ruling last thursday dismissing 
carolee kosters lawsuit 
on saturday afternoon officials said koster shot the judge as 
daronco tended his garden and followed him into the house where 
the judge died in his study and koster killed himself with a shot 
to the head 
ms koster 38 of manhattan sued in 1981 claiming sexual 
harassment and salary discrimination by chase manhattan bank where 
she was employed in a management position and her former boss 
allan ross 
during the seven years of litigation daronco appointed to the 
federal bench last june was the third judge to handle the case 
marshall e lippman who represented ms koster from 1983 to 
1985 said lawyers for chase and ross defended the case 
aggressively and numerous pretrial motions were filed by both 
sides at least two changes of lawyers by ms koster added to the 
delay he said 
lippman said he withdrew from the case over strategy differences 
with ms koster and she began to represent herself 
she was communicating directly with the judge and other parties 
in the lawsuit which made my job difficult to impossible he 
said 
he said she became impatient with him and the case became 
almost a vendetta against both the bank and mr ross almost a 
case of justifying her existence all of the emotional torment that 
she had been through 
ms stefflre said ms koster twice turned down settlements 
once before trial and once after it started 
ms koster could not be located by the associated press for 
comment monday and her manhattan phone number is unlisted but the 
new york post reported she said she had turned down a 300000 
settlement 
i refused but today im sorry i didnt say yes she 
reportedly said 
a spokesman for chase manhattan fraser seitel said we wont 
have any comment on that it is not unusual in a situation where 
protracted litigation may result to discuss settlement 
ms koster told the newspaper her father believed the judge was 
biased against her 
i still love my father she said im sorry about what 
happened but i believe he thought he was doing something out of 
love too 
koster a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at the chase 
manhattan branch where his daughter worked spent much of his life 
savings on the case the fbi official said 
the koster family was totally consumed with this case and it 
had become a crusade in their lives esposito said

appealed a government order deporting him 
military officials said schools were opened because violence had 
declined but three palestinians were killed sunday in one one of 
the worst days in recent weeks and a new underground leaflet 
called a general strike for wednesday 
the army has examined the education system and teachers 
who were connected with the rioting are not teachers today brig

conversion to judaism which would allow him to come back under a 
law that makes all jews citizens of israel 
he was born in jerusalem and his lawyers say he cannot be 
deported under israeli law israel says awad who spent 15 years in 
the united states before returning to jerusaem in 1985 is an 
american whose tourist visa has expired 
israel took steps to deport awad after he urged palestinians to 
use civil disobedience against israeli occupation but israel 
claims that is not the reason for the order against him

daoud was charged with causing grevious bodily harm for allegedly

a group called the unified national command 
our glorious victory by going back to school proves our slogan 
that we learn in whatever circumstances it said 
it called for a oneday general strike wednesday to mark 40 days 
since the assassination of plo military chief khalil wazir also

an investigative team is looking into 
what caused sequoyah nuclear plants balky unit 2 reactor to shut 
down monday for the second time in 3 days 
the reactor automatically shut down at 1228 am monday because 
of an instrument problem in its reactor coolant system said joe 
bynum the tennessee valley authoritys assistant manager of 
nuclear power 
bynum described the incident at the twinreactor plant outside 
chattanooga as minor and said it represented no danger to plant 
employees or the public 
the shutdown was the second at sequoyah since may 13 when unit 
2 became tvas first reactor to go back on line since the federal 
utility shut down its nuclear program in august 1985 because of 
safety concerns 
unit 2 was approaching 75 percent power at the time of mondays 
shutdown about the same level it had reached on may 19 when a 
water gauge problem caused the reactor to automatically power down 
it was a relatively minor instrumentation problem that we can 
correct said janice brady a plant spokeswoman as weve said 
repeatedly because of the complexity of any nuclear plant its 
not uncommon for a unit to automatically shut down 
the reactor had restarted saturday after repairs and 
adjustments and plant workers were calibrating a transmitter that 
provides readings on reactor water flow when mondays shutdown 
occurred 
the plants investigative team will be evaluating the cause of 
the shutdown bynum said the transmitters will be recalibrated 
and unit 2 will be returned to safe operation when all activities 
are completed

the securities and exchange commission in a 
warning to the financial planning industry said monday it was 
suspending a new mexico investment adviser for failing to tell 
clients she was earning commissions on the securities she 
recommended 
without admitting or denying guilt nida rae ellis vice 
president of westmark financial services albuquerque nm agreed 
to accept an sec censure and a 120day suspension from working as 
an investment adviser or securities broker 
in what sec officials said was a groundbreaking case the 
commission found that beginning in june 1986 ms ellis who was 
president of the new mexico chapter of a national organization of 
financial planners violated federal laws by failing to tell 
clients she would receive a commission when they bought into 
limited real estate partnerships she was selling 
she also failed to tell customers they did not have to go 
through her to purchase the investment the sec said and some of 
the clients were not suited for investments of that level of 
sophistication and risk 
officials said it was one of the first cases brought against an 
investment adviser who is also registered as a securities broker 
it is very important that when investment advisers are wearing 
these various hats that they have to bear in mind they have a 
fiduciary responsibility to their client said fred l chavez 
sec assistant regional administrator in denver 
kathryn b mcgrath director of the sec division of investment 
management said consumers seem to approach financial planners 
as trusted advisers and financial planners seem to market their 
services in that light you can come in to us and you dont have 
to worry about those brokers or insurance agents who are trying to 
sell you something 
however many of them if not most of them are in fact just 
like the broker or the insurance agent thats trying to sell 
something she said were saying they just have to make that 
clear to the consumer so they can evaluate the advice with a grain 
of salt 
the action we brought hopefully will tell other financial 
planners were dead serious these are rules youre subject to and 
you have to comply or else she said 
ms ellis did not immediately return telephone messages left 
monday afternoon at westmarks office in albuquerque a woman 
answering the telephone at the office said no officers of the firm 
were available to discuss the case 
hewitt covington counsel for the international association of 
financial planning in atlanta would not comment on the westmark 
order but said the association investigates complaints against any 
of its 24000 members and would reprimand or expel a member when 
justified 
covington said many investment advisers work only for fees much 
as a lawyer or accountant and accept no commissions on securities 
they sell while others are paid both 
life is full of conflicts of interest and it is not 
necessarily nasty to sell something youre recommending provided 
you make the proper disclosure he said 
investment advising is a fastgrowing field about 12000 firms 
are registered with the sec as advisers

managua the sandinistas denied them free movement and the right to 
meet with domestic opposition groups 
in the statement monday the five nicaraguan resistance 
directors said sapoa and san juan del sur were proposed as meeting 
sites by defense minister humberto ortega the presidents brother 
and head of the government delegation

the house of lords gave prime minister margaret 
thatcher an important victory monday killing an attempt by rebels 
in her conservative party to amend tax legislation 
the unelected upper chamber of parliament voted 317183 against 
an amendment that would have mandated a closer link to a persons 
ability to pay it was the largest turnout in the lords since 1971 
although the lords and house of commons still may consider other 
amendments the governments victory ensures passage of the major 
principles of the tax legislation which was nearly defeated by a 
commons revolt in april 
lord chelwood leader of the rebellion in the lords said during 
debate on his amendment that the thatcher government proposals 
are a lot less fair than the current system 
they have very little support said chelwood a former 
conservative member of the commons they are extremely unpopular 
in the country 
he condemned suggestions by some peers that the chamber had no 
right to challenge legislation passed by the commons the lords 
does not have the power to interfere with taxation but some lords 
said it was not clear whether the poll tax was an issue of taxation 
or local authority 
we are a revising chamber seeking to exercise restraint on 
the otherwise unfettered power of the commons chelwood said 
if we cannot tamper with legislation we really have nothing to 
do 
under the socalled poll tax which critics say is unfair to the 
poor property taxes are levied on each adult rather than on houses 
or apartments although the poor will get rebates they must pay a 
tax of at least 5 percent 
the legislation a clause in the bill on local government 
finances is central to mrs thatchers legislative program for 
curbing expenditures by local councils most of which are 
controlled by the opposition labor party 
in the lords on monday many peers echoed government assertions 
that people would be less likely to elect freespending councils if 
they felt the pinch of the local tax bill 
a rebel amendment was defeated 320295 a month ago in the 
commons where the conservatives have a majority of 101

the senate on monday easily rejected three new 
republican challenges to the mediumrange missile treaty and senate 
minority leader bob dole said it would be an embarrassment to 
president reagan if the pact isnt ratified before reagan goes to 
moscow next weekend 
the kansas republican told his colleagues the ball is in our 
court the republicans court as the democraticcontrolled 
chamber began a second week of work on the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty 
later secretary of state george shultz met with republican 
senators and urged approval of the pact before the summit 
here is a treaty that has been examined in more detail than 
any arms control treaty in history by far shultz said after the 
capitol hill session there is a time to inquire and there is 
also a time to vote it would be a good thing to have it 
the first decision came when the senate voted 8113 to kill an 
amendment by sen jesse helms rnc it would have prevented the 
treaty from taking effect until reagan reassures congress about the 
accuracy of the number of triplewarhead soviet ss20 missiles 
which will be destroyed 
later the chamber killed on a 6826 vote an amendment by sen 
malcolm wallop rwyo that would have required a change in the 
treatys text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would 
have permitted construction of some soviet missiles 
then the senate rejected 815 an amendment by sen gordon 
humphrey rnh that would have delayed the inf pact until the 
two nations agreed on a more farreaching pact providing 50 percent 
cuts in each sides large arsenals of longrange atomic weapons 
humphrey said we ought to wait until we see the whole 
picture before approving any pact but critics termed it a 
killer amendment designed to derail the treaty 
before the votes dole told his colleagues again the senate 
should approve the pact before reagan meets soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev in moscow from may 29 to june 2 
helms and other conservatives have blocked action by the full 
senate delaying the ratification that even critics say is assured 
ratification requires a twothirds majority voting in favor 
im still convinced it would be an embarrassment to the 
president of the united states to sit down with mr gorbachev later 
this week without the senate have taken action to consent to 
ratification of the treaty dole said 
however he added we have some serious issues that in some 
cases may take several hours or days 
the treaty signed dec 8 by reagan and gorbachev requires 
destruction within three years of all atomic missiles with ranges 
between 300 miles and 3400 miles for the soviets that includes 
400 deployed ss20s and another 250 stockpiled ss20s 
the united states has accepted the soviet statement of 650 
ss20s even though defense intelligence agency analysts say the 
soviets may be hiding more than 250 of the weapons 
we were snookered helms said the estimates are that the 
soviets have 300 to 600 more than the 650 thy admit to having 
this is a gut issue helms said it could mean the 
difference between survival and destruction for europe or a good 
part of it 
but sen richard lugar rind noted that reagan administration 
officials have rejected helms claim although lugar conceded it is 
difficult to prove that no ss20s are hidden 
it is akin to proving the loch ness monster doesnt exist 
lugar said 
sen alan cranston dcalif said that even if ss20s are 
hidden they could not be deployed without violating the treaty and 
their viability would degrade quickly without testing 
helms amendment is not needed it is unnecessary and it would 
hamper our efforts to get the inf treaty in place cranston said 
wallops proposal affected a part of the treaty which he said 
was written in such a way as to permit production of soviet ss25 
missiles that would be interchangeable with stages in the ss20 
the ss25 is not banned 
this amendment just is to make certain that we do what we set 
out to do wallop said explaining that he wanted to make sure 
that no ss25s were produced that would be interchangeable with the 
ss20 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee agreed with wallop that the treatys language 
is awkwardly written 
but pell said the amendment wasnt needed because if the soviets 
produce ss25 stages which are interchangeable with the ss20 they 
would be in violation of the pact 
among the issues remaining to be settled is an amendment backed 
by the democratic majority which would require senate approval 
before any future administration could change how the united states 
interprets the inf pact 
that amendment is the result of a fight between reagan and 
democrats over the us interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile pact 
reagan asserts that his administration unilaterally can change 
how the treaty is interpreted a view disputed by congressional 
democrats the amendment banning any inf reinterpretation was added 
by the senate foreign relations committee over the opposition of 
republicans 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said monday the 
treaty should be nailed in it shouldnt be subject to 
reinterpretation 
he said im certainly not interested in any erosion of the 
senates constitutional role in treaty making i dont propose 
to give the store away

a man who says he was raised to be a racist 
pleaded innocent monday to a federal charge of threatening to kill 
black democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
londell williams 30 was accused in an indictment last week of 
threatening jacksons life the indictment also accused him and his 
wife tammy 27 of possessing an unregistered automatic rifle and 
threatening and intimidating a government informant 
at their arraignment before us district judge edward l 
filippine the williamses pleaded innocent to the charges but said 
nothing in their own behalf 
in response to questions to determine their competency both 
told the judge they do not have mental problems and do not abuse 
alcohol or drugs 
they and their lawyers declined comment following the court 
appearance 
filippine gave lawyers on both sides 11 days to file 
postarraignment motions the judge set a trial date of july 18 
the williamses were arrested may 13 at their apartment in 
washington mo about 50 miles west of st louis they had lived 
there about a year since moving from a farm in the ozark hills of 
southwest missouri 
the us attorney said initially that evidence including a 
secretly recorded conversation between londell williams and the 
informant indicated that a white supremacist organization called 
the covenant sword and the arm of the lord was conspiring to kill 
jackson june 21 or july 4 williams said jackson was targeted 
because he was getting too close to being president of the united 
states 
the governments complaint which preceded thursdays 
indictment cited a loaded ar15 rifle that with help from an 
informant was found by sheriffs deputies in a wooded area of 
franklin county

londell williams and maps one of which bore his fingerprints the 
complaint said

informant during a meeting on may 11

conspiracy the fbi has said that it has been unable to find any 
evidence that the williamses belonged to csa or any other white 
supremacist organization 
since their arrests the williamses have denied that they are 
members of such groups londell williams also has denied in media 
interviews having planned to kill jackson

morale is low in many red army units in 
afghanistan as at least 100 soviet soldiers are known to have 
deserted according to a study released monday citing widespread 
instances of ethnic friction drug use suicide and fragging 
the murder of officers by their troops 
the study conducted for the army by the rand corp before the 
start of the soviet withdrawal found that the war in afghanistan 
has shown that ethnic cleavages in the soviet armed forces continue 
to be deep particularly between moslems and russians and other 
slavs 
but the author alex alexiev cautioned that many of the 
problems encountered by the red army in afghanistan stemmed 
specifically from that conflict and would not be likely to play 
much of a role in other war scenarios such as a conflict between 
the warsaw pact and nato

the first nonexperimental aircraft that 
flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the 
spotlight monday hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators 
and top military brass 
the v22 osprey a tiltrotor craft that takes off and hovers 
like a helicopter and flies like an airplane received a standing 
ovation from a crowd of 1600 the crowd watched as the camouflaged 
craft was towed onto the tarmac at bell helicopter textron incs 
flight research center 
the first flight of the v22 which has been in development for 
30 years is scheduled for aug 15 an advanced experimental model 
the xv15 has been flying since 1977 
fort worthbased bell and boeing helicopter co of philadelphia 
are jointly developing the v22 for the navy marines and air 
force the three services plan to buy 682 of the twinengine 
aircraft at an estimated cost of 166 million each 
its kind of awesome marine corps commandant alfred m gray 
jr told the crowd 
it works its ahead of schedule and will be a sound 
investment for taxpayers money said navy secretary william l 
ball iii comparing the tiltrotors production to the jet engines 
development as aviation milestones 
you are proving every day that a great country can still 
outthink outdesign and outproduce all comers ball said 
the three military services plan to use the v22 for combat 
assault search and rescue medical evacuation and specialforces 
missions other uses including antisubmarine warfare also are 
being studied the cabin can carry 24 combatequipped troops in 
addition to a crew of three 
on our abortive rescue attempt made in iran a few years ago 
think what could have happened if theyd had an osprey said 
house speaker jim wright referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44 
american hostages from tehran 
the osprey about the size of a medium transport aircraft has a 
stocky 573footlong fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick 
stubby wings its engines point upward during takeoff and landing 
with 38foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground 
the engines rotate or tilt forward once the v22 is 
airborne rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers 
pulling the osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft 
the tiltrotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop 
plane more than 360 mph but doesnt require an airport or 
runway it also can hover like a helicopter 
im convinced that in the next 20 years there will be 
thousands of these in use said bell president lm jack 
horner 
bell has talked with american airlines and several commuter 
companies about civilian uses for the craft a spokesman said 
the new york and new jersey port authority is a strong 
supporter of this concept said horner we could build a lot of 
v22s for the cost of one airport 
the britishdesigned harrier jumpjet also takes off and lands 
vertically but using jetpropulsion rather than a rotor system

syria called it out of the question 
for iran to join any military force sent into the south beirut 
slums to end 18 days of fighting between shiite moslem factions 
lebanese officials reported monday 
they said syrias rejection of an iranian proposal to join such 
a force was conveyed by syrias military intelligence chief in 
beirut brig gen ali hammoud at a sixhour meeting with irans 
deputy foreign minister hossein sheikholeslam that ended at dawn 
monday 
mortar and howitzer fire pounded the 16 square miles of 
tinroofed shanties and narrow alleyways monday killing 13 people 
and wounding 78 police said 
in east beirut president amin gemayels phalange fighters and 
men of the main christian militia lebanese forces fought with 
machine guns and hand grenades monday night for control of the 
capitals christian sector 
police said five combatants were wounded in the sin elfil 
district including at least one phalangist and two from the 
lebanese forces they said fighting began after lebanese forces 
gunmen wounded nabil kahhaleh phalangist commander in the 
district and that it abated at about 11 pm 
representatives of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of 
god and the prosyrian amal militia also attended the overnight 
meeting between syria and iran 
mondays casualties raised the toll to 279 killed and 951 
wounded since battles for control of the slums broke out may 6 
between hezbollah and amal 
the lebanese officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the dispute over who would serve in a military force in the 
slums again delayed syrias plans to try to end the fighting 
most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon including nine 
americans are believed held by hezbollahaffiliated kidnappers in 
the embattled enclave 
two beirut dailies the independent annahar and leftist 
assafir reported that hammoud and amal representatives insisted 
that the syrian army take charge of security in south beirut 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem endorsed the 
demand 
there is no other alternative the syrian army has to go in to 
stop the bloodletting and end the plight of the population hoss 
said in a statement 
annahar quoted the iranian deputy foreign minister as saying 
iran would approve a syrian military intervention in the slums only 
if the hostage situation was resolved in a way that serves the 
objective for which they were kidnapped 
sheikholeslam did not elaborate but annahar quoted him as 
saying the hostages were a vital issue for iran 
iran also demanded guarantees that hezbollah will be free to 
continue political activity in the slums after the syrian 
deployment 
syria has kept massed around the slums about 7500 troops 100 
tanks and 400 armored vehicles since hezbollah overran amal 
strongholds to seize control of 90 percent of the urban 
battleground 
syria is irans main arab ally in the 7yearold persian gulf 
war against iraq long a rival of syria in arab politics 
but hezbollahs move to dominate lebanons 12 million shiites 
has strained that alliance 
the syrians consider neighboring lebanon to be vital to their 
security 
amal spokesmen have complained that delaying syrian deployment 
will only prolong suffering of thousands of civilians trapped in 
the slums 
police have said about 70 percent of the slums estimated 
250000 residents have fled to safer areas

corporate leaders and three of the nations 
most popular musical groups on monday announced a drive to 
encourage american youth to prepare themselves for a future in the 
workforce 
this is a longterm commitment william h kolberg 
president of the national alliance of business told a new 
conference this is a very competitive world we need every 
single young person to be educated to be available to want to 
work and to be productive 
noting that youth unemployment was triple adult unemployment 
kolberg said there were thousands of young people who could benefit 
from job training but were not getting the proper information 
each years school dropouts cost the nation 240 billion in lost 
income and productivity over their lifetimes he said adding that 
the figure doesnt even begin to take in the costs due to drugs 
and alcohol abuse to crime to simple human misery and despair 
the program involving kolbergs group the national association 
of broadcasters and the nations job training system will use the 
popularity of musical groups aerosmith los lobos and rundmc to 
promote the message of work works 
when these kids wont listen to us they will listen to them 
we are determined to make a dent in this problem kolberg said 
he said that rundmc alone will play to more than one million 
people at their concerts this summer and if we can reach a 
fraction of them with the message that work works and that jobs and 
skills training is available then we can make a difference 
each of the rock groups will record public service 
announcements appear in press conferences with officials in cities 
on their tour and donate job information booths at each of their 
concert sites where members of the audience can apply for jobs and 
training kolberg said 
also at the news conference were the three members of rundmc 
joseph simmons run darryl mcdaniels dmc and jason mizell jam 
master jay 
the group also has been active in the drug enforcement 
administrations antidrug promotion raising money for famine 
relief in africa and the special olympics and talking to teens 
about gangs and the need for education 
we dont want to preach we can only set an example by being 
involved with a program like this said mcdaniels weve been 
telling them to say no to drugs and other things we want them to 
say yes to staying in school and being a success at anything they 
want to do

a man who made greed his god was 
convicted monday of kidnapping and murdering a prominent 
businessman who was buried alive and suffocated in a botched 1 
million ransom scheme 
jurors deliberated only about an hour following a weeklong 
trial before finding daniel edwards 31 of bourbonnais guilty of 
murdering kankakee businessman stephen small 
edwards stood quietly and showed no emotion as the verdict was 
read in the courtroom of kankakee county circuit judge john michela 
a second phase of the trial will determine whether edwards is 
sentenced to death 
small 40 was the greatgrandson of former illinois gov len 
small and was a member of a family with major media holdings he 
was the former vice president of mid america media a group that 
owned radio and cable television stations before the company was 
was sold in 1986 
edwards livein girlfriend nancy d rish 26 also was charged 
in the scheme and is awaiting trial 
earlier monday prosecutors said edwards planned smalls 
kidnapping because he craved money 
edwards was a man who made greed his god said frank 
nowicki an assistant illinois attorney general 
all danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put 
stephen small in a box said michael ficaro another 
assistant illinois attorney general slamming his hand on the top 
of the coffinsized crate in which small died 
i never saw anybody come out of a grave you bury people who 
are dead in a grave ficaro said 
but edwards attorney sheldon reagan argued that small was 
buried with candy bars lights and water and hadnt been harmed 
before being put in the box he said a faulty air supply system 
caused smalls death 
its an accident but its not an intentional murder said 
reagan who suggested someone else abducted small i know you 
want to convict somebody but certainly not for murder 
small was lured from his restored victorian home with a 
telephone call after midnight sept 2 1987 his family received 
clear instructions for delivering the ransom 
two days later police found smalls body in the box buried 
under 3 feet of sand 13 miles southeast of kankakee 
the jury picked in northern illinois winnebago county because 
of publicity the case received locally heard a tape of smalls 
voice relaying the ransom demand to his family and heard witnesses 
who saw edwards building the box 
perhaps the most chilling evidence was the taperecorded voice 
of small on the telephone telling his wife nancy its no joke 
im inside a box grave 
its under a couple of feet of sand or something like 
underground small told his wife i want you to get 1 million 
god only knows how youre going to do that he says theres 48 
hours of air for me 
prosecutors called the tapes the voice from the grave 
reagan however told jurors that no one had identified the 
voice on the ransom tapes as edwards voice and said the facts 
dont tell you that edwards was the kidnapper 
throughout the trial the box was on display in the courtroom 
take a good long look said ficaro danny edwards greed 
for the big score drove those nails dug that grave and buried 
stephen small alive

italianborn roberto succo one of 
frances most wanted criminals as a multiple killer and a robber 
was found dead in his prison cell monday in an apparent suicide 
succo 26 who was accused in a string of murders and robberies 
in france switzerland and italy was discovered with his head in a 
plastic bag said vicenza police chief piernicola silvis 
a magistrate was investigating the death silvis said 
last week an italian judge declared succo mentally incapable of 
understanding or taking part in his defense the judge referred to 
psychologists who found succo schizophrenic and a danger to society 
succo was arrested feb 28 near treviso his native town in 
northern italy on charges of illegal possession of a gun and using 
false documents 
two days later he bolted from his guards in the courtyard of 
the treviso jail and climbed on the roof he stripped to his 
underwear and hurled bricks at cars before he fell after dangling 
from a roof cable succo slightly injured was transferred to the 
more secure jail in vicenza 
succo escaped in may 1986 while on furlough from a psychiatric

the defense in the irancontra case sought a 
court order monday to ensure that the justice department has the 
final say over whether to proceed with the prosecution of the case 
lawyers for fired national security council aide oliver l north 
and three codefendants sought a ruling that the attorney general 
has the sole authority to determine whether use of sensitive 
documents to prosecute the case would jeopardize national security 
under the classified information procedures act cipa the 
government can decide that disclosure of secrets in a criminal 
trial would so jeopardize national security that the case should be 
dropped 
the defense sought to disqualify independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh from making that determinion under cipa which was invoked 
because the irancontra conspiracy case involves an unprecedented 
volume of highly secret government documents 
any determination to proceed with prosecuting the case will 
profoundly affect this countrys national defense and its foreign 
relations the defense said in a joint filing with us district 
judge gerhard a gesell 
a blunder by the ic independent counsel may well result in 
serious ruptures with our closest allies in the loss of vital 
secrets to our enemies and in the deaths of innocent persons of 
whom the ic does not even have knowledge the defense said 
congress has entrusted the delicate balancing that cipa 
requires to the attorney general and did so with utmost clarity 
precisely to avoid such disasters lawyers for north former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and richard v secord said in the brief 
the four are accused of conspiring to defraud the government by 
diverting profits from the us sale of arms to iran to the 
nicaraguan rebels when direct american military aid to the contras 
was banned by congress 
in a may 13 filing walsh said he had authority to decide decide 
whether to seek declassification of the large volume of secret 
documents that would be needed to try the case 
such authority was derived from the independent counsel statute 
and the parallel appointment he received from the attorney general 
to prosecute the case walsh said 
but the independent counsel conceded that he must be 
deferential to the executives determination as to whether national 
security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified 
information 
in the final analysis walsh reluctantly conceded that the 
justice department would have the final say it is the inherent 
function of the executive branch to maintain the confidentiality of 
sensitive national security information to the extent necessary to 
permit the government to conduct the foreign affairs and national 
defense activities effectively walsh had said 
the defense said it wanted the order to disqualify the 
independent counsels office becuse its vague promise to pay 
deference to the executive branch in exercising the attorney 
generals responsibilities under cipa cannot mask its attempt to 
seize power over national security in singleminded pursuit of its 
own interests 
more than 200000 pages of classified government documents were 
collected by walsh during his investigation of the irancontra 
affair walsh said some 50000 are relevant to the case and 5 
percent to 10 percent of the total contain highly sensitive 
information that could jeopardize us intelligence operations 
only the government agencies that classified the documents in 
the first place have the power to declassify the material so it can 
be used in court as evidence 
the judge can delete classified text from a document or 
substitute a statement of facts to show what the document would 
prove if it were introduced as evidence but gesell has indicated 
an unwillingness to spend much time poring over secret material to 
prepare sanitized versions for a jury 
no date for the trial has been set

results were rigged in a special mayoral election in the northern 
steelproducing city of monclova 
the party known as the pan planned protest meetings this 
week in monclova and other cities throughout the northern border 
state of coahuila state to pressure the state legislature to reject 
the figures said juan antonio garcia villa the pan president in 
monclova 
a special election commission said over the weekend that benigno 
franco colorado candidate of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party or pri won the may 8 election by 294 votes 
more than 23000 ballots were cast 
the state legislature has not certified the results 
the pan says its candidate carlos paez falcon won by 448 votes 
it says it has copies of all the voting results and can prove 
that the figures from seven precincts were altered 
because of this intent of fraud the pan is calling on its 
supporters to carry out legitimate protests garcia said by 
telephone monday 
manuel clouthier pans presidential candidate in july 6 general 
elections broke off campaigning in northern tamaulipas state to 
head monday for monclova garcia said clouthier will announce 
civil disobedience tactics at a rally there 
garcia said pan supporters already were marching in protest near 
the international bridges at ciudad acuna and piedras negras just 
south of the texas border 
the pri won the coahuila gubernatorial race and 37 of the 38 
mayoralties at stake in regular elections on oct 25 1987 
but the state legislature citing voting irregularities and 
violence annulled the monclova elections and set special elections 
for may 8 
the pri and the pan have fought for nine years for control of 
monclova a city of 300000 people about 200 miles south of the 
texas border at eagle pass 
its most recent administration was controlled by a bilateral 
commission appointed after neither party could prove it won the 
1984 mayoral race

jesse jackson unveiled a fiveyear 
budget plan that would raise taxes on the rich freeze defense 
spending and increase support for social programs on monday he 
dismissed democratic rival michael dukakis earlier proposals as 
radically conservative 
dukakis the democratic presidential frontrunner defended his 
spending priorities saying they do represent a fundamental 
change 
and he indirectly criticized jackson for trying to map out 
specific expenses so far in advance theres no way you can 
prepare a budget today for 1989 dukakis said after an appearance 
at a child care center in cranford nj 
the massachusetts governor spent most of monday in boston while 
george bush was in washington leaving the campaign trail to 
jackson 
jackson made sure they werent forgotten attacking the budget 
policies of the reagan administration and complaining that dukakis 
proposed changes were too timid 
we cannot be fooled into thinking the reaganbush deficits 
make social justice impossible jackson said at a news 
conference the jackson budget reduces the deficit and funds 
needed investments this is a budget for a strong and secure 
america 
jackson also made an appearance at a day care center and the 
rancho seco nuclear power plant the object of a sacramento area 
voters referendum seeking to shut it down permanently as he 
campaigned for his share of the 314 democratic national convention 
delegates up for grabs in californias june 7 presidential primary 
jackson drew some boos from the rancho seco plant workers when 
he told them the nuclear power industry is a dangerous job 
option 
his fiveyear federal budget plan would increase taxes on the 
wealthy by 244 billion and on corporations by 104 billion cut 
defense spending by 164 billion by imposing a fiveyear freeze on 
projected spending hikes and increase spending on social programs 
by 344 billion 
he said it would also cut the nations deficit from a projected 
134 billion in 1993 to 49 billion 
jackson repeatedly contrasted his budget proposals with those of 
dukakis which he characterized as inadequate to reverse the 
republican priorities set over the past eight years by president 
reagan 
reagan has cut investment in health care housing legal 
services day care scholarships by more than 100 billion mr 
dukakis rails against that as being wrong but offers to offset it 
by only 775 million jackson said 
that is radically conservative away from the dreams and 
aspirations of most democrats unless there is a commitment to 
economic justice and change he will find himself taken adrift to 
sea by the democratic constituents instead of leading them he 
will be on a raft without a rudder jackson said of dukakis 
our commitment is not to make bland beautiful its new 
directions jackson continued 
christopher edley dukakis issues director said jackson was 
unfairly criticizing dukakis plans for spending 775 million 
500 million on the fund to rebuild america 250 million on a 
teacher excellence program and 25 million on a literacy corps 
the way to make critical new investments in a time of 
tripledigit deficits is not to make unrealistic promises about 
massive new spending edley said in a telephone interview from 
boston we have to think of creative ways to use modest federal 
resources to pull in private and state and local funds 
jackson repeating a campaign theme said he would raise up to 
58 billion a year for social programs such as housing education 
and health care by freezing the military budget at its current 300 
billion level for the next five years 
my plan allows for a significant new social investment 
including doubling of the education budget by 1993 a new national 
housing initiative and an additional 3 billion per year for the 
war on drugs these investments and deficit reduction are made 
possible by a combination of fair taxes on the wealthy and 
corporations and a freeze on pentagon spending for five years 
jackson said 
i am for a strong defense i also support a sound approach to 
the military budget our plan would freeze military spending 
jackson said 
cost overruns two additional aircraft carrier task forces 
star wars and the midgetman do not make us stronger they undermine 
our economy and make us weaker even after the jackson cuts real 
military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 1980 
he said 
dukakis also opposes the two additional aircraft carrier task 
forces and the midgetman missile system and would cut back the 
star wars nuclear defense program to 1983 levels dukakis has 
called for a stable overall defense budget with increases in 
conventional forces coming from cuts in strategic systems 
the biggest tax increase in jacksons budget plan would restore 
the top 385 percent income tax rate its just the top 600000 
taxpayers who earn 200000 and above who will return from 28 
percent to 385 percent they can afford it jackson said 
other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax rate on 
corporations impose a 05 percent securities transfer excise tax 
to raise 10 billion annual revenue and discourage major corporate 
mergers and takeovers limit deductions for business meals to 50 
percent and impose a 7billionayear polluters tax on 
corporations 
among his proposed new investments are programs which by 
1993 would spend an extra 20 billion annually on education and job 
training 17 billion on housing programs 12 billion on health 
and nutrition programs and 3 billion more annually on aids 
programs 
jacksons budget proposals also include 5 billion more in 
transportation funding 45 billion for scientific research in 
nonmilitary fields 17 billion annually on environmental 
programs and 1 billion more annually for international economic 
assistance

a heavily traveled bridge near new york 
city is believed to contain the first pair of peregrine falcons 
discovered nesting along the hudson river in three decades an 
animal expert said monday 
the falcons behavior indicates they are tending to nestlings in 
a box placed by conservationists in a tower of the tappan zee 
bridge along the new york thruway said dennis mildner curator of 
museum of the hudson highlands in cornwallonhudson 
the state department of environmental conservation and cornell 
university have been trying since 1974 to reestablish peregrine 
falcons by releasing more than 160 young peregrines raised in 
captivity in the hopes they will mate 
conservationists know of at least 10 mating pairs in new york 
state including two pairs on other new york city bridges 
mildner said people and pesticides have disturbed the 
peregrines traditional nesting areas in cliffs above the hudson 
but that nesting perches in bridges afford a clifflike environment

a man described as mentally unstable 
hijacked a colombian jet with 135 people aboard monday and forced 
it to fly to panama and aruba after letting the passengers off the 
plane later returned to colombia where the man vanished 
the captain of the avianca airlines boeing 727 said the hijacker 
apparently jumped off the plane as it was rolling toward the 
terminal monday night at the international airport in cartagena on 
colombias carribbean coast 
the plane was hijacked on a domestic flight monday morning after 
it took off from medellin in northwest colombia it returned to 
medellin where 131 people were allowed off then was forced to go 
to panama where it refueled and to aruba an island off the coast 
of venezuela 
no one was injured 
the captain luis eduardo gutierrez told the colombian radio 
chain caracol that he informed the hijacker the plane did not have 
enough fuel to reach cuba the mans intended destination 
libardo arteaga aviancas spokesman in cartagena told radio 
chain rcn that no one in cartagena neither police nor the control 
tower knew the plane was coming 
as the plane was taxiing in the darkness toward the runway in 
cartagena the captain said the crew noticed a light in the cabin 
indicating that the planes rear stairway had been lowered 
when the plane pulled up to the terminal at the rafael nunez 
international airport police rushed aboard but could not find the 
hijacker gutierrez said 
the hijacker who had gripped a hand grenade throughout 
apparently fled in the darkness gutierrez said police searched 
slums and a swampy area around the airport 
authorities identified the hijacker as albeiro jimenez a 
colombian gutierrez said he had no further information about the

the hijacker was said to be carrying a pistol and two hand 
grenades in a suitcase the pilot copilot and flight engineer 
were captive aboard 
the boeing 727 landed in aruba at 345 pm edt after being

in colombia and panama for 100000 and safe passage to cuba 
the plane was neither refueled nor resupplied in this tiny 
autonomous member of the kingdom of the netherlands dijkhoff said 
the air pirate told authorities in panama that he wanted to go

could be crazy 
castano told a news conference in bogota the hijacker said he 
wanted the money because he is suffering from a fatal disease and 
wants to spend his last days happily 
the hijacker demanded the money in panama but because of a 
banking crisis there the hijacker was told that payment was 
impossible castano said 
castano said released passengers reported the hijacker was 
short blond dressed in sports clothes and appeared to be about 30 
years old 
everything happened very fast but there was no panic

white and nonwhite members of 
parliament took part in joint debates monday for the first time 
members of the farright conservative party walked out in protest 
the party said in a statement the members wanted to record 
anew our deepfelt rejection of being cogoverned by other 
population groups 
the debates dealt with the budgets of south africas four 
provinces and were conducted in the provincial capitals by members 
of the relevant committees in the white asian and mixedrace 
chambers of parliament 
the government in revising parliamentary rules to allow the 
joint debates stopped short of permitting joint voting on any 
issues 
until we can debate and vote together this meeting today is 
an historical farce said marius barnard of the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party 
the asian and mixedrace chambers were created in 1984 under a 
new constitution which continued to exclude the black majority from 
national affairs 
the white chamber dominated by president pw bothas national 
party is able to get its way on all major legislative issues the 
conservative party with 23 of 178 seats is the largest white 
opposition party 
in pretoria where the transvaal province budget was debated 
several legislators objected to stringent security checks conducted 
as they entered the meeting hall 
we cannot allow ourselves to be subjected to such demeaning 
checks said yusuf seedat of the asian chamber after he and other 
lawmakers were ordered to empty their pockets offer their 
briefcases to be searched and produce their parliamentary identity 
cards 
during the debates government officials pledged to expand black 
hospital facilities suggested that new laws would be enacted to 
control black squatters and reported that the first recreation 
resort for blacks in the orange free state would be ready next 
year 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a former professor suing to become the fifth woman 
granted tenure in the harvard business schools 80year history 
testified monday that the academic guidelines were manipulated to 
deny her tenure because of her sex 
barbara bund jackson 44 who resigned in 1984 is asking us 
district judge douglas p woodlock to reinstate her with tenure and 
award 847000 in lost income 
manipulation of the tenure process and the use of review 
procedures different from those used for men are the absolute 
core of the discrimination ms jackson testified in the first 
day of her nonjury trial 
ms jackson has also charged that the school destroyed documents 
requested by her to support her claim that lessqualified men 
received tenure from 1974 to 1984 
harvard maintains in court papers that ms jacksons academic 
work was substandard and that the tenure records were unwittingly 
destroyed by someone outside the business school 
ms jackson testified she was pressured into submitting new 
examples of her scholarship sooner than it was required she also 
asserted that a faculty member threatened not to support her in her 
tenure bid because of conflicts over what material a course should 
cover 
i believe this was done with the express purpose of 
discriminating against me on the basis of sex she testified 
ms jackson was asked repeatedly to cite specific incidents of 
sex bias she alleged against several faculty members when she was 
unable to on one occasion she said 
to me bias is a spectrum and i dont know where to draw the 
line in that spectrum she said 
in court papers the school said that ms jackson was given a 
virtually unprecedented second chance after she was denied 
tenure in 1981 and that the faculty voted by just 3631 to support 
her 1983 bid a low margin a tenure committee rejected her 
tenure decisions at harvard are submitted to the faculty to 
gauge support for the professor the actual decision rests with the 
university president who receives a recommendation from the 
schools dean 
she was given an extremely thorough and fair review in 1981 
and 1983 and the decision was made entirely on her academic 
qualifications allan a ryan jr an attorney for harvard said 
in court papers 
ms jackson a marketing consultant began teaching at harvard 
as an assistant professor in 1973 she was promoted to associate 
professor in 1977 
in her first attempt at tenure she failed to win support of the 
faculty which cited inadequate scholarship ms jackson was given 
a threeyear extension on her appointment and submitted new 
academic work for review 
three of the 90 business schools tenured professors are women 
four women have received tenure in the business schools history 
the first in 1961 the school said 27 percent of the 819 students 
in the class of 1988 were women 
legal experts say few gender bias cases make it to trial and 
plaintiffs have won even fewer cases because judges are reluctant 
to rule on matters of academic merit 
nationally 72 percent of male faculty members have tenure 
compared with 45 percent of females according to a recent survey 
of 1055 two and fouryear institutions by the american 
association of university professors

the supreme court heard an appeal monday by an 
arabamerican advocate of civil disobedience who asked the judges 
to revoke a deportation order against him 
he threatened to convert to judaism and return to israel if the 
order stands 
mubarak awad 44 was ordered deported by israeli officials on 
may 6 they said he had played a leading role in the 24week arab 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the threejudge panel reserved decision after mondays appeal 
hearing but did not set a date for its ruling the decision is 
expected to have farreaching consequences for the legal status of 
the 130000 arabs living in israeliannexed east jerusalem 
during the threehour hearing lawyers for both sides focused on 
awads legal status under israeli immigration law 
the court must consider whether the jerusalemborn awad and 
other east jerusalem arabs enjoy an irrevocable status as permanent 
residents or if they can lose their rights under certain 
conditions such as leaving the country for more than seven years 
nili arad an attorney for the interior ministry argued that 
awad should be deported because he forfeited his right to permanent 
residency by leaving israel for 13 years from 1970 to 1983 and by 
accepting us citizenship awad lived in wapakoneta ohio while 
maintaining a home in jerusalem 
awads attorney avraham gal said israel had no right to deport 
his client because as a longtime resident of arab east jerusalem 
awad enjoys a special status that cannot be revoked 
israel annexed east jerusalem after the 1967 middle east war 
but never defined the legal status of the sectors arab residents 
most of whom rejected offers of israeli citizenship 
ms arad argued that since the annexation the interior ministry 
in practice has applied the rules of permanent residency to 
citizens of east jerusalem and that awad falls into that category 
if the court rules in favor of the interior ministry all east 
jerusalemites are in danger of mass transfer said jonathan 
kuttab a west bank lawyer also representing the arabamerican 
those who grant residency permits can also take them away 
he added 
awad who has been jailed since may 5 looked pale when he 
entered the packed courtroom wearing a beige suit and a 
bluestriped shirt he kissed his americanborn wife nancy nye 
and talked to reporters during recess 
awad rejected government allegations that he had helped incite 
often violent antiisraeli protests he said he stood by his 
advocacy of nonviolent action such as tax boycotts and strikes 
he also said israels effort to deport him has helped popularize 
his ideas my ideas have caught thanks to the israelis who put 
so much pressure on me awad said 
however awad seems fairly isolated in the palestinian 
community and underground leaders have not mentioned his case in 
the leaflets they distribute in the occupied lands 
asked what he would do if deported he told reporters he had the 
option of converting to judaism and coming back under israels law 
of return which grants automatic israeli citizenship to all jews 
awad is christian 
awads troubles began in august when the interior ministry 
refused to renew his identity card issued by israel in 1968 since 
his return from the united states in 1983 awad had stayed in 
israel on tourist visas stamped into his us passport but in 
november the interior ministry refused to renew that permit

the supreme court on monday overruled a 
decision by the tel aviv city council barring women from voting for 
the citys chief rabbi 
the court ordered the council to hold new elections for its 10 
delegates to the 30member body which will elect the chief rabbi 
and warned it not to discriminate against women 
the citys labor party faction last year elected two women 
haviva avigai and lili menachem to the elective body the council

italys roman catholic bishops on monday deplored 
recent demonstrations of antisemitism that have apparently 
occurred in reaction to israels policies toward palestinians 
the statement by the italian bishops conference followed 
charges by jewish leaders that the italian press including roman 
catholic publications have helped incite antisemitism through 
their reporting on the middle east conflict 
the bishops statement published in the vatican daily 
losservatore romano and carried by vatican radio made no direct 
reference to the allegations by jewish officials but it strongly 
urged catholics to distinguish between the jewish people and the 
policies of the israeli government or political parties 
the tensions between palestinians and israelis continue to 
provoke in the italian milieu and therefore also among catholics 
grave preoccupations for the risk of distortions of information and 
consequent emotive reactions which in the extremist fringes can 
explode into violence the statement said 
antisemitism in italy seems to some a marginal phenomomen and 
uncharacteristic of italian society it added still episodes 
of intolerance against jews and jewish institutions occurring even 
recently provoke in our community feelings of profound 
preoccupation for the risk of painful civil and religious 
lacerations that can derive from them 
the statement also stressed the need to promote a dialogue 
between jews christians and moslems and to be builders of peace 
together 
last week romes chief rabbi elio toaff and jacob sabban 
president of the jewish community held a news conference to detail 
recent antisemitic incidents in italy among other things they 
displayed packs of anonymous and threatening letters and dozens of 
photos of swastikas painted on walls 
the two said the media including catholic publications fueled 
antisemitic feelings in italy with reports from the middle east 
that tend to compare israelis to nazis because of the israelis 
policies toward palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
the vatican earlier expressed surprise at the jewish 
allegations and noted that pope john paul ii has often spoken out 
against antisemitism 
riots began dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians of the 
west bank and gaza strip which israel captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war at least 194 arabs have been 
killed and an israeli soldier and jewish settler also have been 
slain

a new state law allowing students to choose 
their schools will improve education proponents say but some 
educators fear the plan could hurt smaller schools and bring 
unhealthy competition

sound choices says nan skelton assistant state education

the transfer would interfere with desegregation ratios in

three american writers ostracized and ignored in 
their own country during their lifetimes have an organization in 
china dedicated to remembering their contributions to the communist 
revolution 
the smedleystrongsnow society of china a wing of the 
prestigious academy of social sciences was founded in 1984 to 
honor the three midwesterners who were among the first to tell the 
world of the cataclysmic events in china in the 1920s and 30s 
the most famous of the trio is edgar snow 190572 the first 
westerner to interview mao tsetung and chou enlai in the caves of 
their guerrilla stronghold in northwest china and author of red 
star over china his classic account of the communist leadership 
he is joined by agnes smedley 18921950 a fiery supporter of 
revolutionary causes and anna louise strong 18851970 
chronicler of socialist upheaval in both the soviet union and china 
in june the 3s society marks the 50th anniversary of the 
publication of red star over china with a major symposium on 
the book at beijing university 
the society made up of more than 100 scholars and writers who 
knew the three americans or studied their works is also holding an 
essay contest on the book and will invite students from schools in 
beijing shanghai and kansas city snows hometown to attend the 
symposium 
we want young people to read history to find out how china 
traversed this road and reached this stage said former foreign 
minister huang hua president of the 3s society 
huang snows interpreter when he interviewed mao tsetung said 
young chinese read too many books of love martial arts and 
adventure works of people such as snow should be popularized 
so their contributions to the chinese cause will not be forgotten 
snow arrived in shanghai in 1927 for a planned sixweek visit 
and stayed nearly 14 years in one of journalisms greatest scoops 
he found his way to the red army headquarters in northwest chinas 
baoan in 1936 and spent five months observing and talking to mao 
and his fellow communists 
he was the first western journalist to break the news blockade 
chiang kaisheks nationalists had imposed on the communists red 
star published in britain in 1937 and in shanghai and the united 
states the next year became the seminal work on the band of 
revolutionaries who were to change the face of china 
his book gave not only the west but also many chinese their 
first detailed look at the communist leaders and many 
intellectuals trekked to communist headquarters after reading it 
its hard to imagine what our image of china would be today 
without edgar snow said former new york times reporter harrison 
salisbury a prominent writer on the soviet union and china 
salisbury said snow whom he met in the soviet union in world 
war ii had been my hero as he had been the hero of a whole 
generation of newspaper men 
snow left china in 1941 and worked around the world as a roving 
correspondent for such publications as the saturday evening post 
the chicago tribune and the new york herald tribune 
in 1959 after years of being hounded by anticommunist 
mccarthyites he left the united states for switzerland but he was 
to make one last contribution to his native land in 1970 mao told 
snow that china would welcome a visit by thenpresident nixon 
setting the stage for nixons historic trip in 1972 
china showed its respect for snow by sending a medical team to 
geneva in a futile attempt to save the life of the dying writer in 
1972 some of his ashes are buried in new york and some on a 
university campus in beijing where he once taught 
unlike snow who was never a marxist the two women writers were 
outspoken in their support for leftist causes smedley born into 
poverty in st joseph mo and raised in mining towns was a 
strong advocate of womens rights and anticolonial struggles in 
germany india and china 
she worked with sun yatsens widow soong chingling and 
chinas most famous modern writer lu xun she wrote a biography of 
red army commander zhu de and in 1937 in the communist camp at 
yenan taught chou enlai and other communists to square dance 
in 1949 a us army report accused her of spying for the 
soviets and she died in london in 1950 while trying to get back to 
china 
strong a native of friend neb was a pacifist opponent of 
world war i and left for the newly founded soviet union in 1921 
a resident of moscow for almost 30 years she wrote some 30 
books on revolutions around the world she too made her way to 
yenan in 1937 and interviewed mao in 1946 when he made his famous 
statement all reactionaries are paper tigers 
she was arrested as a spy and expelled from the soviet union in 
1949 only to be further attacked on her return to the united 
states for her communist leanings she died in beijing at age 84 
during the extreme leftist cultural revolution isolated in her 
last haven by the suspicion that prevailed then against all 
foreigners 
dong leshan translator of a 1980 edition of red star over 
china that sold 13 million copies in china said the works of 
the three writers were not always welcomed in china 
after the revolution snow was still taboo because he told the 
real story of the party some in the party took a negative view of 
this he said 
it was only after the cultural revolution ended in 1976 dong 
said that red star and snow found acceptance

a fighter jet swoops about 250 feet 
over farmer bernh buschmann and his wife anna the roar spooks 
their horse and scatters the hens across the barnyard 
nato warplanes skimming over trees farms and villages in mock 
battles have been a common sight in west germany for years 
airmen from seven nations in the north atlantic treaty 
organization including west germany take part in a total of 
70000 lowlevel training flights in this country each year more 
than in any other nato land according to the west german defense 
ministry 
but thousands of west germans now are saying theyve had enough 
of it 
i know the defense of our country is important but these 
lowlevel fliers are annoying said the 56yearold buschmann 
whose farm is just outside borken near the dutchwest german border 
those jets are really a nuisance and the animals dont care 
too much for them either said his wife 
on one recent day about 50 military jets were in the air over 
the borken area many of them in lowlevel maneuvers 
opposition to the lowlevel flights soared after two recent 
crashes on march 30 a french fighter jet crashed near a nuclear 
power plant in bavaria a day later a us f16 plummeted into a 
west german town destroying homes and killing a resident 
about 60000 west germans belong to grassroots organizations 
pressuring the federal government to do something about lowlevel 
military flights activists say 
west germans complain such flights give them nightmares impair 
their hearing cause high blood pressure and make their children 
irritable 
i get these very ugly dreams said daerbel stechel a 
45yearold activist who lives in wischhafen near bremen and hears 
nato jet fighters screeching overhead nearly every day 
in one of them im swimming in a very beautiful lake and 
suddenly jet fighters are falling all around me into the water 
this is very bad she said 
earlier this year the respected wickert institute polled west 
germans and found that 15 percent want nato to stop its lowlevel 
military training flights 
twothirds of the 1710 people polled said such flights were 
necessary but that the number should be reduced the institute said 
most people who oppose these flights are not members of the 
greens west germanys environmentalist party but just citizens 
who cannot stand the noise any longer said udo rinner a 
45yearold engineer and activist who lives in muenster 
for example i am a conservative and am vehemently against the 
lowlevel flights 
the lowlevel runs in which the warplanes fly at altitudes as 
low as 250 feet are limited to seven areas less densely populated 
than other parts of the country five areas are in the north half 
and two in the south 
forty percent of the lowlevel flights are by the west german 
air force said ruediger jaeschke a spokesman for the west german 
defense ministry 
the remainder are flown by americans british dutch french 
canadians and norwegians he said 
all nato flights in west germany are coordinated by a west 
german air forces control center in porz which is between cologne 
and bonn 
the nato allies refuse to divulge how many warplanes are based 
in west germany which is temporary home to about 900000 foreign 
soldiers 
jaeschke said the lowlevel flights are important for natos 
defense of west germany 
he added that nato is considering a midday break of a couple 
hours a day when the jets would have to stay on the ground 
in addition he said the nato allies are always looking for new 
technological means to soften the jets roar 
much has been done in the last few years to lower the level of 
the noise from the jets jaeschke said 
but he strongly rejected activists views that lowlevel flights 
should be stopped 
the warsaw pact the soviet blocs defense alliance has a 
numerical advantage over nato in several areas jaeschke said if 
our pilots train too little the warsaw pact advantage becomes 
greater 
us air force authorities also say lowlevel training flights 
are necessary 
they are required to provide realistic training to nato air 
crews maj gen richard pascoe commander of the 17th air force 
at sembach air base near kaiserslautern said 
we must train the way we expect to fight

academy awardwinner rod steiger says it was 
his characters lolitalike relationship with a young girl that 
attracted him to the latest desperado movie

daughter but shes not 
slaten is the heavy of the film but steiger said he doesnt 
play him that way 
i just think of him as a character to play he said let 
the audience be the judge i think the mistake a lot of actors make 
when they play a heavy is to go through the boards 
every human being has something he wants if the something i 
want makes me a criminal then i become the heavy i wonder how 
many times ive been killed in films i know its at least 60 
times in early live television i was killed every week it seems

of acting i saw all the pretty girls going into the theater 
program he said i had the gi bill and could take acting 
lessons i got 85 a month lived in new york and had a good time 
but i fell in love with acting and became a fanatic i kept 
telling myself not to get a job youre not an actor yet so i

carroll oconnor plays the role steiger had in the film steiger 
was not offered the role but he saidi dont know if i would

a sharp rise in ivory prices has brought a 
surge in the slaughter of elephants by poachers in kenyas tsavo 
national park 
the slaughter which over the years has seen more than 80 
percent of the parks herd perish will continue until the illegal 
ivory trade is halted said esmond bradleymartin an american 
conservationist who has lived in kenya for nearly 25 years and is 
an expert on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade 
the shortterm prognosis for elephants is dim he said 
people realize ivory is worth a lot outside the country they 
essentially are raping a natural resource 
prices have reached 73 a pound up from about 20 a pound five 
years ago he said 
an aerial survey in february of tsavo and its surrounding 
ecosystem found 5363 elephants about a third the number at the 
beginning of the decade 
the herd is about onesixth the estimated 35000 that remained 
in 1974 after a fiveyear drought killed 9000 according to the 
survey sponsored by the european economic commission the east 
african wildlife society and the kenyan government 
most of the bleached bones and rotted carcasses spotted in the 
15385squaremile area were of elephants killed more than a year 
ago according to the survey 
tedd goss coordinator of antipoaching efforts for kenyas 
ministry of wildlife credited intensified efforts by reinforced 
antipoaching units in tsavo with keeping the slaughter from 
getting even worse 
the slaughter of elephants by poachers is not confined to kenya 
and at the current rate of killings africas elephants could 
conceivably be wiped out in eight to 10 years 
but experts say it is not likely the worlds biggest land animal 
will be hunted into extinction they explained the elephants will 
continue to retreat to protected areas or deep into forests making 
it more difficult for poachers to find them 
however the tsavo slaughter dramatizes an alarming decline in 
elephant populations already evident from detailed counts taken of 
east africas closely studied herds 
studies by the nairobibased united nations environmental 
program unep indicate a drop in population since 1973 of 85 
percent in kenya and 89 percent in neighborng uganda another 
neighbor tanzania has lost 53 percent of its elephants in the last 
10 years 
everyone knows that for years poachers have been killing 
elephants for ivory iain douglashamilton a scottish elephant 
expert in nairobi wrote recently in swara the east african 
wildlife societys bimonthly magazine 
what nobody appears to be aware of other than a few wardens 
and wildlife scientists is the extent of the destruction of 
elephants in east africa and how fast the remaining elephants are 
disappearing 
douglashamilton who helped assemble the unep data said 
information is scanty for the rest of africa but he added that 
available information paints a picture that is similar to or worse 
than the elephants situation in east africa 
an estimated 750000 elephants remain in all of africa down 
from about 13 million in the late 1970s according to 
bradelymartin the amount of ivory traded in the world market 
through 1985 averaged about 800 tons a year representing an 
offtake of about 75000 elephants annually he said 
he estimated that an additional 100 tons remains in africa where 
it is carved up and sold on the tourist market 
in the mid1980s perhaps 50 percent of all ivory leaving africa 
was illegal according to bradleymartin who said more current 
data were not available 
legal ivory is that which has been obtained through sanctioned 
culls of elephant herds or from natural deaths 
there is absolutely no way poaching could continue without 
senior collaboration in governments and business bradleymartin 
said 
in january kenyas ministry of wildlife fired seven officials 
and disciplined eight field officers suspected of helping poachers 
or embezzling funds it also named a new director 
hong kong also is cracking down on the illegal ivory market 
there and has imposed heavy fines and jail terms for people 
convicted of importing raw ivory without a license 
hong kong and japan are the worlds largest consumers of ivory 
along with the united states which is considering legislation that 
would stop almost all ivory imports 
douglashamilton believes the elephant slaughter will stop only 
when the ivory trade is banned altogether 
dont buy it dont wear it dont sell it he said

after six months in office premier li peng 
remains something of a mystery perhaps not an exciting one 
universally described as methodically attuned to solving 
problems rather than politicking the 59yearold li is generally 
regarded as bland but the kind of leader china needs to solve 
problems slowing the decadeold modernization drive 
overshadowed by his predecessor the urbane and nattily dressed 
communist party chief zhao ziyang and without power to 
singlehandedly formulate policy li has yet to offer any bold 
initiatives 
he has given few clues to his own vision of chinas future or 
his goals as premier other than reducing an 11 percent inflation 
rate 
although he is one of the five members of the communist party 
politburos standing committee chinas most powerful policymaking 
body li has been exceptionally cautious in public statements 
he remains dogged by a widely held assumption that he owes his 
job to nepotism he is the adopted son of the late premier chou 
enlai his rise to the premiership was meteoric he was appointed 
acting premier in november just eight years after being given his 
first government post minister of power 
the national peoples congress chinas legislature confirmed 
him as premier in april 
a few days later he became the target of satirical attacks in 
posters put up by students at beijing university 
if li peng can become premier who cant said one 
lis main credentials for the job were his technical skills and 
connections trained as an engineer in the soviet union he spent 
most of his career running power projects and never ran a city or 
provincial government 
after becoming minister of power in 1979 he rose in rapid 
succession to vice premier in 1983 politburo member in 1985 and 
education minister later that year as education minister he 
escaped responsibilty for the widespread prodemocracy student 
demonstrations of 198687 saving himself by denouncing liberal 
intellectuals 
many intellectuals dislike him for that and for his failure to 
improve their salaries and living conditions 
however unpopularity is the least of lis problems because 
chinas premiers are selected by party leaders not the ballot box 
he must cope with inflation that has reached its current 11 
percent from 6 percent two years ago he also must unclog chronic 
supply bottlenecks and get rid of waste in government offices and 
state factories 
but any dramatic initiatives to do all those things would need 
the approval of fellow members of the politburo standing committee 
including zhao his predecessor 
zhao had a mandate for change when he became premier in 1980 and 
many of his policies remain in force 
that leaves li with the task of trying to implement policies set 
by zhao who may not look kindly on any changes in them by an 
underling 
when li took office it was widely speculated he favored central 
planning over zhaos marketstyle reforms 
but lis comments have given no sign he opposes those reforms 
but zhaos reforms have hit snags that li now must try gingerly 
to resolve 
one is economic incentives such as bonuses for workers who 
increase productivity they were liberally distributed and had come 
to be automatic in addition the bonuses are said to have eaten 
into capital investment and helped fuel inflation 
an asian diplomat quoted chinese sources as saying li recently 
refused to approve automatic bonuses maintaining the incentives 
should be more closely linked to production increases 
that report remains to be confirmed 
but li has made city mayors responsible for decontrolling 
statesubsidized food prices 
and in a profile of lis first 130 days in office the official 
weekly magazine liaowang outlook credited him with playing a 
major role in working out a plan to streamline and reorganize the 
government bureaucracy

colony 
i just invented a new flavor to commemorate the islands 21st 
anniversary of independence sandford said the concoction

i learned the basics just enough to make vanilla ice cream 
he said after the first six months i knew how to make ice 
cream but i had to learn to improve it and then to master it 
today he said i am the king 
sandford makes 18 flavors fresh each day he claims he has 
created 751 in all and is seeking an entry in the guinness book of 
records 
every single recipe is different he said i do not take a 
vanilla base and simpl change the name as i add different 
ingredients 
sandford also meets special requests 
on wednesdays he prepares ice cream for diabetics using 
artificial sweeteners instead of sugar 
for vegetarians sandford makes carrot and zucchini ice cream 
creamy avocado also is popular 
not every flavor is a bestseller 
tomato did not do too well he said too acidic 
some flavors contain promotional gimmicks the main ingredient 
in money ice cream is a tightlyrolled barbados dollar wrapped 
in plastic 
sandford did not set out to become a oneman baskin robbins or 
howard johnsons when he opened gelato five years ago in a chic 
mall in suburban st michael one mile outside bridgetown 
but shipping delays high costs and import duties convinced him 
he could not rely on importing the starters or basic flavors 
from the united states 
i first started experimenting with local fruits he said 
now his favorite sherbets are made with mangoes watermelons and 
passion fruit 
sandford wont say what goes into his fire ice cream which 
tastes like hot cinnamon candies 
but he guarantees this will burn your palate

not only does it offer tips on how to live on 
seawater or finding your way out of a jungle martyn forresters 
new survival manual has advice on how to get through a hijacking 
martyn forrester claims his survival skills handbook 
includes the first howto guide for hijack hostages 
the book is about survival in any situation whether your 
plane has crashed or whether youre in a situation where you are 
trapped youre a hostage he said in an interview 
the main premise of the book is that youll survive if you 
think you can no situation shows that better than the hostage 
situation 
most of forresters suggestions involve coping mentally with 
being held hostage 
captives should keep busy with mental activity and avoid 
depression he writes always remember that the captors can 
control your body but they cannot control your mind 
hostages should try to establish a rapport with their 
kidnappers he advises but adds that logic is not valid in this 
sort of situation relate on an emotional level 
communicating with a nervous triggerhappy hijacker can be 
risky he says but its something thats worth trying if you 
physically can 
the book also suggests precautions for international travelers 
worried about hijackers dont wear militarystyle clothing or 
carry military identification papers 
youd be surprised at the number of people who get on 
airplanes in camouflage military jackets and dog tags around their 
necks forrester said 
the book also recommends that air passengers carry family 
photographs in their passports or wallets 
they will make you appear a family person with dependents and 
a less likely candidate it is hoped for execution 
forrester said the books section on hostages and hijackings 
contains tried and tested ideas as well as theoretical 
models of people who are dealing in this field clinical 
psychologists who are actually involved in hostage situations 
with hijackers becoming more sophisticated he said potential 
victims need to be better prepared 
in a hijacking he said what you can do to physically help 
yourself is incredibly limited but what you can do to keep 
yourself sane is entirely up to you you either help yourself or 
you dont 
forrester 35 says he gained his expertise while undergoing 
military training courses in britain 
he has never been involved in a hijacking and admits his 
expertise is more on the techniques but an expert on terrorism who 
reviewed forresters suggestions agrees that publishing them is a 
good idea 
bernard adamczewski of the londonbased institute for the study 
of terrorism found the advice for hostages sensible provided you 
can take it in 
most of such advice is really common sense he said in an 
interview and some people cant be calm in such circumstances 
while mental preparation is important adamczewski said the 
books best advice is that international airline passengers should 
carry as little identification with them as possible 
the survival skills handbook is available in britain and 
other englishspeaking countries and forrester hopes to publish it 
in the united states soon 
he maintained that with his advice travelers will at least be 
able to find comfort in the fact that they have done something to 
protect themselves 
they can actually think right im scared about the journey 
i can take those labels off my suitcase i can make sure ive got a 
nice picture of my wife and kids or husband in my wallet so at 
least if i am stuck in that situation ive done what i can he

dogs and cats have become major parts of 
millions of american families and when summer brings hot weather 
and vacation travel pets need some special attention 
summer means added hazards for pets from heatstroke to 
heartworms but with help pets can cope they can even go along 
on most vacation trips according to pet care experts 
probably the biggest hazard faced by pets in the summer is 
overheating particularly if left in an automobile even for a 
brief period 
on a warm day the temperature in a parked car can reach 160 
degrees in a matter of minutes even with partially opened 
windows warns the humane society of the united states with 
only hot air to breathe your pet can quickly suffer brain damage 
or die from heatstroke 
the simple answer is dont leave the pet alone in a parked car 
leave them home when on a trip to the store or other errand 
if dogs are left outdoors make sure they have shade available 
and fresh water check the yard at all times of the day to be 
sure shade is always available 
cats says the humane sociaty should be kept indoors all year 
it keeps them from overheating from getting run over by cars and 
from other hazards 
joggers and beach fans also need to remember that whats fun for 
them may be dangerous for a dog 
canines will try and keep up with a jogging master and an 
outofshape pooch can injure itself by pushing beyond its limits 
and dogs were simply not built for the beach where there is little 
shade and they can overheat burn the pads of their feet and be 
attacked by sand fleas 
as humidity goes up dog heat tolerance goes down and dogs 
dont sweat to relieve the heat the way humans do according to 
animal care specialists at the department of agriculture 
still traveling with a pet can be fun especially if you get 
them checked in advance by a veterinarian and provide a good travel 
carrier 
bring along familier food stop frequently to give them water 
and let them exercise and make sure to have two collars on the dog 
with identification on both in case they slip out of the one 
with the leash attached 
many hotels and motels accept pets and airlines will make 
special arrangements for them 
the american automobile association and alpo petfoods have put 
together a handy pamphlet on traveling with pets called pets on 
the go it discusses health and safety in traveling what to take 
along and many other considerations 
copies are available free at local aaa offices or by sending a 
stamped selfaddressed long envelope to pets on the go aaa public 
affairs 8111 gatehouse road falls church va 22047 
one added thought about vacations the humane society notes that 
some people will adopt a stray animal while on vacation then leave 
it behind when they return home 
lonely scared and hungry these leftovers will wander in 
search of their owners until killed by a passing car disease or 
starvation the humane society warns people who can no longer care 
for an animal should at least take it to the nearest animal shelter 
as to summers more routine problems here are some thoughts 
from the federal food and drug administration 
heartworms are a major danger in summer and can cause death to 
a dog they are transmitted by mosquitoes and are most common in 
warm areas but are spreading have dogs checked by a vet and then 
begin use of preventive medication 
fleas and ticks can cause major discomfort and may carry 
disease special soaps collars powders and sprays can help but 
be sure to get the brand labeled for your pet dont use dog 
sprays on a cat for example serious cases may require veterinary 
care 
regular grooming is important for dogs to find ticks and brush 
out tangles and mats from the coat its not a good idea to shave 
longhaired dogs though since the coat protects them from sunburn 
and for some breeds it insulates them from the heat

by almost any definition the annual inflation 
rate is under 5 percent and unlikely to move much higher than that 
in the near future 
but as you probably have suspected that doesnt mean your 
personal rate cant rise faster than that if you are inclined 
toward socalled finer things your inflation rate could be close 
to doubledigit 
but in all probabilility the higher your personal inflation 
rate the more you can do about it most directly by dropping your 
sights to alternative purchases that cost less and maybe serve as 
well or better 
evidence of this comes in the national financial planning index 
produced by the 24000member international association for 
financial planning this year it is 9 percent higher than 1987 for 
a very atypical basket of goods 
the essentials 
a 75000 annual income a onechild family an upscale home 
financing for a retirement plan saving for a fouryear private 
college education payments for a new car a oneweek vacation a 
500000 life insurance policy 
after setting money aside for paying taxes the association 
informs us this family is likely to have only 25 percent left for 
food medicine monthly bills and clothing 
but is the family pressed or is it pressed only because of its 
conception of what is important in life 
the assumptions 
a 7 percent 25year mortgage on a 258098 home in an affluent 
suburb 
financing over a 25year period of a retirement plan to yield 
169000 a year 
saving over a 12year period to finance a fouryear private 
college education for the one youngster 
financing a 16162 car volvo saab chrysler lebaron over 
a fouryear period 
saving for a oneweek family vacation in the caribbean to cost 
2334 not including food and personal expenses 
annual cost of a 500000 life insurance policy 
state federal and social security taxes 
all this according to those folks dedicated to helping you make 
ends meet will cost 55896 or 746 percent of gross household 
income a 9 percent jump over similar costs in 1987 
in offering this national financial planning index the 
association includes an unusual caveat this family needs to 
readjust spending goals 
why issue such an index especially in view of the statement by 
larry carroll the associations chairman that we are not 
telling people they should be spending threequarters of their 
income on all of these items 
rather he continued we hope people will look at this index 
examine their own financial situation set some realistic goals and 
objectives for themselves and then adjust their present budgets as 
necessary 
realism isnt difficult to apply to the association hypothesis 
why insist on an upscale home in an affluent suburb why assume 
it will not rise in value and thus afford the occupants a big gain 
toward their retirement fund 
why look forward to retirement with a plan that relies partially 
on the assumption that savings will earn 7 percent income while 
inflation amounts to 5 percent for a net of 2 percent 
why would anyone save 6648 a year for college tuition at a 7 
percent rate while inflation also roared along at 7 percent 
which in this instance the index assumes 
who needs an annual vacation in the caribbean 
who needs an upscale automobile

images of michael jackson dancing to rock music in 
a pepsi commercial flicker across the soviet television screen and 
levis jeans hug the hips of young russians in a crowded subway car 
amerika as the soviets call it has arrived 
far behind the iron curtain we were able to develop a 
prowestern mentality and what tell me could be more western 
than america emigre author vasily aksyonov wrote about his youth 
in the soviet union of the 1950s 
even the cyrillic alphabet hasnt prevented what the russians 
call amerikanizatsia jeansi stop break dance ok 
and one of the latest signs of the times stress are now 
part of the russian lexicon 
soviet communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev has 
encouraged his people to learn more about america to demonstrate 
his sincerity he has allowed more travel to the united states 
ended the jamming of voice of america broadcasts and removed 
barriers to joint business deals 
in april a record 1200 soviets most of them jews were 
allowed to visit relatives in the united states an additional 
1000 soviets traveled there on official business before 
gorbachev only a handful of soviets visited the united states 
monthly 
the 1985 geneva summit gave an official stamp of approval to 
cultural agreements and peopletopeople exchanges under the 
agreements soviet and american lawyers doctors students 
musicians scientists and teachers have visited each other 
in some instances the exchanges reflect a soviet desire for 
american help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and 
drug addiction problems the government previously denied existed 
at the grassroots level soviets need little encouragement to 
talk about things american 
when introduced to an american many soviets immediately start 
with the questions on everything from war and peace to the 
availability of hamburgers 
a taxi drivers reaction when a passenger introduced himself as 
an american was to run down the american authors she loved ernest 
hemingway mark twain ray bradbury collections of these authors 
in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some 
soviet apartments more contemporary american authors are lesser 
known because their works still arent available in the soviet 
union 
levis jeans are required attire in certain circles and some of 
those who manage to get an american candy bar soft drink or pack 
of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living 
rooms 
many soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of america 
tapes of movies such as police academy and rambo dubbed in 
russian are passed among friends in a thriving black market where 
blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles 80 or one quarter of an 
average monthly salary 
the black market also feeds on young soviets thirst for 
american rock music records of madonna and michael jackson fetch 
exorbitant sums jacksons music videos have appeared on soviet 
television and his pepsi commercials hit the airwaves in midmay 
during broadcast of a fivepart series on the united states 
officially sponsored concerts by american musicians such as 
billy joel dave brubeck and the doobie brothers have become major 
happenings 
at the same time some soviet rock stars are traveling to the 
united states boris grebenshchikov the hippylike leader of the 
leningrad rock band aquarium is scheduled to record an album in 
the united states this summer 
the end of soviet jamming of voice of america broadcasts in may 
1987 opened a new source of information about life in the united 
states 
satellite television discussions with american studio audiences 
also have given soviets a chance to learn firsthand about life in 
the united states soviet televisions widely watched evening news 
program vremya has shown features on child care automobiles 
and sports in america and in midmay soviet television broadcast a 
series moderated by former us resident vladimir posner 
but even though soviet media coverage about the united states 
has become more balanced under gorbachev reports about crime 
unemployment racism and the poor are still common 
in politics americans and soviets still have sharp differences 
but for many of the soviets who viewed reagan as a warmonger a few 
years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with 
gorbachev last december to eliminate all mediumrange nuclear 
missiles 
we have no propaganda of hatred toward americans no 
disrespect of americans gorbachev told a group of us teachers 
of russian who met with him at the kremlin last august one 
cannot find them here either in politics or in teaching

both parties are about set on their presidential 
nominees with the season of preliminary winnowing nearly over 
its worth recapturing its gaudier moments and amazing contretemps 
the primary campaigns may not have produced startling breakthroughs 
in political ground but as the following report shows they rank 
high in the long tradition of politics as entertainment

once there were 14 candidates for president 
now there are three 
has the wheat been separated from the chaff has it been 
survival of the fittest or survival of the hardiest richest 
cleverest slickest 
best or not this is whats left after the strangest primary 
season in memory a mad marathon in which history was shaped by 
philandering and plagiarism pratfalls and yawns 
now finally the pack has dwindled down to a tidy few after 66 
primaries and 42 precinct caucuses across the land and in all the 
island territories and clusters of expatriates abroad about 30 
million people have voted at least 170 million has been spent 42 
debates have been debated umptyfourhundred speeches have floated 
up to the poor ozone in clouds of charge and countercharge on the 
order of sos your old man the last pockets of insomniac 
resistance have fallen 
it is a campaign that has gone from the marx brothers to guess 
whos coming to dinner a movie about white liberals who suddenly 
learn their daughter is dating a black man in february people 
were asking what does jesse jackson really want a cabinet job in 
march they were beginning to wonder whom president jackson would 
put in his cabinet by june they were asking what mr jackson 
would settle for outside the oval office 
candidates moved ahead candidates fell behind definitions 
twisted rationalizations multiplied the media decreed that a man 
loses if he does not win by enough 
even winning big could be suspect michael dukakis won big in 
wisconsin but hark an exit poll then showed that fewer of his 
supporters voted for him with enthusiasm than did the voters 
for jackson and albert gore meaningful ominous 
there was something for everybody if you ran second it was 
because the winner outspent you if you ran third it was because 
he distorted your record if you ran fourth you emphasized that 
you trounced the man who ran fifth if you ran fifth you exulted 
in the fact that you did better than last week if you ran last 
you dug down deep and claimed you were doing better than expected 
sooner or later they all beat expected 
something for everybody in 1936 alf landon was buried by 
franklin roosevelt in the greatest until then landslide in 
history some years later landon and his wife ran into norman 
thomas the perennial socialist candidate landon said dear id 
like you to meet the man i licked in 1936 
the election of 1988 already owns a unique place in history on 
several counts we are told by paul f boller jr author of 
presidential campaigns 
no black candidate became a major factor in a presidential 
election before no man was a candidate twice in the same campaign 
no previous race had two preachers running no candidate ever quit 
the race before because of infidelity or plagiarism though 
presidential candidates from tom jefferson to jack kennedy have 
been whispered about before none lost an election because of 
bedroom sport 
but fate failed gary hart even in the tiny detail for example 
the boat he and the young model shared in the caribbean 
couldnt it have been named something romantic but impersonal 
like windsong or north star or something personal but innocent 
like bonus baby or dads day off or something presidential like 
destiny or yankee leader but why by what mystical movement of the 
spheres did they reach so far down the scale of human aspiration 
to call it months later one still cringes to call it monkey 
business 
in their zeal reformers have managed to steer the nominating 
process out of the smokefilled rooms and into the gasfilled 
frenzy of more primaries and more candidates the traffic is 
particularly heavy when the incumbent is not running and the heir 
apparent is less than apparent 
hart was clearly the frontrunning democrat until he quit then 
speculation and attention fastened on three noncandidates gov 
mario cuomo of new york and senators bill bradley of new jersey and 
sam nunn of georgia the actual candidates had trouble getting 
their names in the papers until someone raised the shades on sen 
joseph biden of delaware there suddenly was a candidate for 
president of the united states giving voice to words images and 
reflections that belonged to the head of the british labor party 
caught biden confessed his mistakes and withdrew the urge 
to confess it seemed was in the air 
dukakis campaign manager confessed he was the one who blew the 
whistle on biden which he figured was after all his job dukakis 
confessed how sorry he was and his campaign manager resigned in the 
spreading mea culpa hart confessed to infidelity pat robertson 
campaigning on a call for premarital restraint was caught with 
his marriage license showing and confessed that yes it was dated 
only 10 weeks before his sons birth certificate 
across the political landscape judge douglas ginsburg tripped 
on his way to the supreme court when he confessed he had once 
smoked marijuana so did i said gore me too said bruce babbitt 
i have sinned wept jimmy swaggart who wasnt even a candidate 
it would be difficult to choose among the campaigns most 
dramatic moments for example 
high noon in the senate of the united states 
eyes cold with anger the minority leader strode around the well 
of the chamber to the presiding officers desk where sat the vice 
president of the united states 
what kind of candidate would put out a statement attacking 
another candidate and his wife without reading it robert dole 
snapped 
your people called me a cornered lap dog said george bush 
i didnt call you a lap dog said robert dole

vice president aaron burr and alexander hamilton mightve 
settled it at 50 paces dole and bush returned to the campaign 
high noon on the evening news 
dan rather wanted to talk about irancontra george bush wanted 
to talk about education and the deficit rather said he wanted to 
set the record straight bush said rather had impugned his 
integrity rather said he didnt want to be argumentative but 
bush said it was unfair to judge his whole record by iran and as 
if bringing up a family scandal how would you like it if i 
judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the 
set rather said it was more important to discuss bushs 
qualifications for president than as if delicately paraphrasing a 
profanity what you just referred to 
the temperature rose the pace quickened and soon both were 
talking at once and mercifully neither could be heard 
in their traveling debates the candidates pelted each other 
relentlessly with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast 
wondered if the cavalry would never come democrat or republican 
the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the frontrunner 
since he had the most votes and some might drop loose issues were 
as hard to find as passion 
almost invariably nobody picked on jackson or the reincarnated 
hart because one mans votes were unbudgeable and the others 
nonexistent jackson once the voice of protest in the land took 
on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the 
others when they lost their heads and became adversarial 
jackson of course couldnt do anything about dole on national 
tv one night dole accused bush of lying about his record and 
across the land political behaviorists tsked and said wasnt that 
shocking 
through the last century calling presidential candidates liar 
was a relatively polite form of discourse they were also called 
traitor lecher murderer thief drunkard atheist pickpocket 
syphilitic gorilla 
in the campaign of 1800 john adams federalists described 
thomas jefferson as a meanspirited lowlived fellow the son of 
a halfbreed indian squaw sired by a virginia mulatto father 
raised wholly on hoecake made of coarseground southern corn bacon 
and hominy with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog 
jeffersons republicans lashed back by spreading a story that 
president adams was plotting to marry off one of his sons to a 
daughter of king george iii to begin an american dynasty and revive 
royal links with britain 
in the politesse of the 1988 primary campaign candidates 
grappled more with their image than with each other media 
consultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed that 
dole for example had to fight a mean streak bush a wimp streak 
other perceived streaks to be resisted were dukakis 
mechanistic alexander haig militaristic pierre samuel du pont 
iv rich simon dull robertson funny facts 
they tried various disguises dole smiled more bush thrashed 
rather dukakis danced to bouzouki music simon flipped pancakes 
haig cozied a baby pig du pont said call me pete 
hart and biden brought the democrats odd headlines pat 
robertson took care of the republicans 
in his autobiography robertson wrote that god had told him a 
minister should not run for public office then he announced he 
might run for president then his book was reissued with gods 
injunction excised then he announced that god was now telling him 
to run no other candidate claimed that endorsement 
in new hampshire robertson let it be known that the russians 
still had nuclear missiles in cuba not true said the white house 
but its source was a satellite only 2000 miles up did robertson 
have word from higher authority 
in atlanta robertson said he knew where the american hostages 
were held in lebanon and in washington president reagan wondered 
aloud why he hadnt shared that information with the government 
and then george bush put on his cowboy boots al gore donned his 
downhome smile mike dukakis packed up the old folks pat 
robertson dusted off the family album and away they went to super 
tuesday on a frantic steeplechase across 20 states in which the 
corn pone of dixie was mixed with the slick sell of madison avenue 
and a handshake was replaced by a greeting from outer space 
no primary day ever before had demanded so much travel so 
candidates flitted around like nervous fleas on a dog having a 
nightmare and the constant motion the merciless speechifying the 
pounding tv commercials produced a numbing blur the washington 
post called it stupor tuesday 
gone were the leisurely coffees the candidates had with 
voters in iowa and new hampshire now they hopped from airport to 
airport saw no voters talked fast for local tv and were gone 
again or they holed up in a hotel room and took questions from tv 
stations hundreds of miles away and answered via a satellite 22300 
miles above the equator 
back on earth and lacking only a magnolia in his ear pat 
robertson strode the red clay hills of south carolina proclaiming 
im the only candidate who was born at stonewall jackson 
hospital im the only one who went to college where robert e lee 
was president 
and to the condos of south florida they came to the homes and 
the pools of senior citizens who take their franchise seriously 
richard gephardt appeared in their living rooms with a glowing tv 
benediction from a local hero rep claude pepper 87 dukakis 
showed up with former house speaker thomas p oneill jr 75 who 
spoke highly of dukakis position on social security and medicare 
gephardt sent his 80yearold mother to the condos in person 
dukakis rallied he sent his 84yearold mother and his 79yearold 
fatherinlaw 
and the crocuses came and they campaigned in illinois and 
connecticut and the forsythia came and they campaigned in wisconsin 
and new york and the dogwood came and they campaigned in 
pennsylvania and ohio and the azaleas came and they campaigned in 
new jersey and california and each in turn like the petals of a 
flower whose time had come they fell gently to earth all but 
three

to many sicilians going after the mafia is 
tantamount to trying to suppress the weather italian authorities 
have arrested 4100 suspected mafiosi since 1982 hundreds were 
convicted in maxitrials and sent to prison but in sicily the 
mafia is also known as la piovra the octopus because it 
regenerates severed tentacles

the sicilian mafia far from beaten by 
mass arrests is diversifying its drug operations and reverting to 
lucrative extortion and kidnapping italian officials say 
pressure on the mafia has cut its share of the american heroin 
market from onethird down to barely 10 percent us officials 
say but sales have been channeled instead to western europe 
mafia wholesalers are pushing cocaine into new european markets 
they exchange heroin directly for colombian cocaine eliminating 
the cash transfers that make them vulnerable 
a defector has implicated two recent cabinet ministers echoing 
others statements that senior political figures protect the mafia 
but police say they have no proof to move against politicians 
trials alone are not enough said giusto sciacchitano a 
senior prosecutor interviewed in the concrete bunker where a team 
of magistrates piece together evidence for continuing 
maxitrials 
under new laws italian authorities have seized 200 million in 
suspect earnings since 1982 in december 338 mafiosi were given 
2665 years of sentences after the first maxitrial 
in april a joint usitalian operation disrupted the pizza 
connection which markets mafia heroin in america police arrested 
emanuele adamita a fugitive sicilian drug lord and 101 others 
but public fear official corruption lack of evidence foreign 
refuges and italys legal system were all obstacles sciacchitano 
said the mafia is very hard to beat very hard 
after the maxitrial verdicts were delivered hit men on a 
motorscooter murdered giuseppe insalaco a former palermo mayor who 
fought corruption as he sat at the wheel of his car in rushhour 
traffic 
in italy prosecutors cannot plea bargain nor can police 
infiltrate the law requires that all crimes be punished even when 
committed by undercover officers or states witnesses as part of an 
investigation 
italy is illequipped to protect informers and their families 
from mafia vengeance tommaso buscetta the mafia bossinformer 
behind the first maxitrials took refuge in the united states 
buscetta helped convict vito ciancimino exmayor of palermo 
but sciacchitano said politicians were difficult to put on trial a 
parliamentary committee linked ciancimino to the mafia in 1976 
the mafia has always been at the edges of power said 
attilio bolzoni a journalist who was arrested recently after 
reporting on an informers confession that named two ministers he 
was held six days then released 
us authorities say privately that although italy has scored 
important victories little will change if public officials close 
to the mafia were not rooted out 
apart from outright graft diplomats say some politicians court 
the vital sicilian vote by going easy on the issue 
italian authorities are divided on how far the mafia reaches 
into the state giuseppe grassi director of the anticrime 
department of italys national police force said 
we have no evidence of course there is some official 
corruption that is normal but politicians belonging to the mafia 
i dont think so 
grassi contends that with uncounted billions of dollars in drug 
revenue with sanctuaries provided by latin american governments 
the mafia no longer needs political protection 
authorities have arrested 4100 suspected mafiosi since 1982 he 
said but they can replace them overnight in sicily with all its 
unemployment and poverty he added 
for many sicilians going after the mafia is tantamount to 
trying to suppress the weather 
hah snorted an entrepreneur named napoli when asked if the 
mafia had been weakened he drove his questioner by the leafy 
piazza where joe petrosino a new york detective was murdered in 
1902 
petrosino who was investigating the mafia was shot with a 
sawedoff shotgun known as a lupara modern versions submachine 
guns more recently killed an average of one person a day in 
palermo 
italian and us authorities agreed that mafia families had made 
a strategic retreat to regroup not only reorganizing their drug 
operations but also concentrating more on extortion and ransom 
such venerable dons as michele greco and luciano liggio 
convicted in the maxitrial live lavishly in prison with servants 
bringing them champagne meals from palermos finest restaurants 
these guys can run a drug operation from inside prison just as 
well as they can outside a us drug enforcement officer 
observed

salvatore riina and bernardo provenzano of the dominant corleone 
family are still loose besides police say the mafia is known as 
la piovra the octopus because it regenerates severed 
tentacles 
by the mafia italians mean about 30 sicilian families 
linked in crime not blood whose worldwide income makes up perhaps 
12 percent of italys gross national product 
thousands of men sworn to silence by the code of omerta 
supervise couriers bag men informers and enforcers grassi 
estimates as many as 50000 people might be involved in mafia 
operations 
sicilian patriarchs hold tight sway over family branches in the 
united states and latin america rarely trusting homegrown mobs 
that often go under the generic label of mafia 
the us drug enforcement agency officers discovered that heroin 
networks were compartmentalized so that couriers knew only their 
immediate controller families made sure that key people do not 
talk 
we found that every time we got up to a certain level we had 
a homicide on our hands one senior agent said 
the drug traffic brought deep changes to the mafia which had 
evolved slowly from its roots in feudal sicily where it once 
defended rural landowners 
the mafia has specialized in construction but kept a hammerlock 
on sicilys economy shopkeepers pay a pizzo a premium against 
petty criminals or untoward accidents public services must contend 
with mafia for labor and services 
palermo is the last major european city to dig itself out from 
world war ii its old port is pocked with crumbling buildings and 
gaping empty spaces 
mayor leoluca orlando staunchly antimafia fears contracts 
awarded to local companies will enrich criminals in the past 
reconstruction was stalled because so much money was stolen 
in the city of catania an americantrained doctor said they 
are in everything they decide who is hired and they take a cut of 
what is purchased 
one public hospital spent enormous sums for spoiled food from a 
mafiarun catering service after its kitchen was destroyed 
mysteriously he said 
in the 1970s after the french connection was severed in 
marseille the sicilian mafia hired lebanese chemists and took over 
the business vast new revenues made the mafia a major 
multinational 
sleek ruthlessly ambitious young men began replacing folkloric 
dons in baggy pants the title honorable society lost meaning 
for sicilians who once condoned it 
by some estimates their drug turnover reached 10 billion a 
year at its peak in the late 1970s mafia killers began striking 
back at the state 
in 1982 carlo alberto dalla chiesa a popular police general 
who had fought the red brigades was sent to palermo to quell the 
mafia he and his wife were murdered in a spray of bullets 
hours earlier dalla chiesa had complained to a diplomat that 
rome had not delivered promised support at the funeral his 
daughter rita a television journalist in rome returned flowers to 
officials she suspected were implicated 
i dont know if the mafia is weaker now but people are no 
longer afraid to say its name she said in a recent interview 
in 1982 the la torre law named after a murdered legislator 
made mafia membership illegal and allowed property seizures since 
then a growing antimafia is speaking out 
many young sicilians say they are tired of seeing their province 
paralyzed by fear and stagnation 
rita costa widow of a crusading magistrate murdered in 1980 
has since become a regional legislator dedicated to the antimafia 
we can fight them only by mobilizing people by teaching 
children about the dangers they face she said we must say no 
to the mafia 
even within the mafia some of the old guard draw the line at 
killing wives and using women to smuggle drugs buscetta said the 
breaching of old codes was a reason he turned against the mafia 
in the anteroom outside orlandos office supplicants wait on 
dark wood benches for solutions to their problems city officials 
know that if they do not respond the mafia might 
judge giovanni falcone the flamboyant head magistrate lives 
behind a 24hour guard of heavy arms vault locks and television 
cameras with varying support from rome 
he canceled scheduled antimafia courses at a local university 
when authorities decided it was just too dangerous in some ways 
falcone is more a prisoner than the men he has locked up 
luciano liggio in a wellappointed cell took up painting 
nature scenes his first show sold out and he put the earnings 
toward a kidney clinic for the grateful citizens of corleone

when warm weather covers sicilys ancient 
hills in flowers bus loads of americans converge on corleone 
seeking the godfather they have no more success than italian 
police 
as it turns out the corleone family now dominates the sicilian 
mafia a loose confederation of maybe 30 groups but don vito 
corleone played by marlon brando in the movie does not come from 
this little agricultural town 
most american branches of the sicilian mafia emigrated from 
agrigento an ancient port now choked with new construction from 
illegal money sent home 
corleone is so poor that its 300yearold town hall damaged 20 
years ago in an earthquake is in danger of collapse there is 
plenty of mafia money but it is seldom flaunted 
among most of the 11100 inhabitants of corleone and its 
surrounding fields the word mafia produces a nervous chuckle 
or a silent stare 
no they will tell you they do not know if patriarchs salvatore 
riina and bernardo provenzano are hiding in the wellcharted hills 
at town hall however vice mayor cosmo di carlo rejects the 
idea that his town is especially touched by the sicilywide 
phenomenon 
we have a long antimafia tradition he said producing a 
folder that mentioned a crusading mayor murdered in 1918 when his 
visitor noted it did not specify who killed him di carlo replied 
sir this is a tourist brochure 
deserved or not corleone has gotten used to the nickname some 
italians have given it tombstone 
we had a japanese tv crew here di carlo said i explained 
carefully how all this godfather business was hollywood fantasy 
when i finished they said yes we understand now show us the

as prime fish habitats become more and more 
vital to the tourist industry and state economies so has 
governments role in stocking streams and lakes hardcore fly 
fishermen disdain hatcheryraised trout but defenders say that 
without extensive stocking thousands of anglers would never catch 
a fish at all this is the second of three articles

it was a fishermans fantasy come true 
swimming together in an undulating black wave were 30000 trout 
there was however a problem for the eager angler each of the 
creatures darting around in the concrete tanks 465degree water 
was less than half an inch long 
at the daniel hatchery one of 12 run by wyomings game and fish 
department three employees raise nearly 2 million fish every year 
the dozen state hatcheries planted 32 million fish in wyoming 
waters in 1987 nearly all were trout 
they are kept in temperaturecontrolled indoor and outdoor 
tanks depending on their size and are fed a high protein trout 
chow composed of fish meal liver and grain a pathologist 
regularly checks them for viral diseases and parasites 
state biologists continually survey lake and stream fish 
populations and place orders for varieties according to need 
the daniel hatchery raises seven kinds of trout as well as 
arctic grayling and kokanee salmon the fish range from fry less 
than an inch long through fingerlings up to catchables 8 inches 
and larger there are even lunkers 3pounders that produce 
spawning eggs which are released into streams as 6yearolds when 
their egg quality declines 
hatchery fish production is at an alltime high in many states 
although budget cutbacks in the reagan administration have affected 
some government programs 
the demand for fish is increasing every year and were 
producing the maximum here that we can said daniel manager dick 
cheeney 
thats because all over america right now fishermen are 
untangling lines buying licenses and plunging with gusto into 
another season of hope 
a recent gallup poll ranked fishing as the nations second most 
popular outdoor sport just behind swimming and ahead of bicycling 
the us department of the interior found in a 1986 survey that 
585 million citizens call themselves fishermen in 1962 only 13 
million people fished for fun 
in proclaiming june 612 national fishing week president reagan 
said fishing greatly aids our economy it is a source of 
healthful food promotes respect for sound conservation and for the 
bounty and wonder of our natural resources and introduces millions 
of people to the benefits of outdoor recreation 
the sports fishing institute founded by tackle manufacturers in 
1949 estimates americans spend 282 billion a year on the hobby 
about 750000 jobs either directly or peripherally depend on it 
industry experts agree fly fishing is especially popular among 
baby boomers who have more money and time to commune with nature 
its an ethical sport thats caught the imagination of younger 
people said bob herbst executive director of trout unlimited a 
55000member organization devoted to enjoying and improving 
coldwater fisheries 
herbst said the sport seemed to attract the harddriving young 
executives because it involves a little intellect its more than 
just dangling a worm in a body of water 
tom rosenbauer editor of the orvis news a newsletter published 
by americas oldest mailorder company goes flyfishing on his 
lunch hour 
the people here in the office fish before work and after 
work said rosenbauer who is based at orvis headquarters in 
manchester vt 
there are three or four little brook trout streams right in 
the middle of town that fish very well at noon on a size 14 yellow 
humpy 
he said that in the past 15 years there had been a steady 10 
percent to 15 percent growth in orvis flyfishing equipment 
business 
then last year there was a 50 percentplus jump in our tackle 
sales rosenbauer said our flyfishing schools now fill up 
with waiting lists i think the boom everybodys been predicting 
for the past decade is here 
in the west fly fishing is a vital and growing part of state 
economies heavily dependent on tourism wyoming montana idaho and 
colorado which have depressed agricultural and natural resource 
sectors compete against each other for the big bucks brought in by 
vacationing anglers 
the growing dependence of tourism dollars on prime fish habitat 
has engendered a debate over the merits of stocking blue ribbon 
coldwater streams and lakes with hatcheryraised fish

in the united states thousands of miles of water flow through 
the 729 million acres of public lands each states water law 
varies but generally the people have access to all of americas 
navigable streams unlike in england where almost all sports waters 
are privately owned 
fishing regulations are still evolving from colonial times 
when we rejected the english ways but created a vacuum said paul 
schullery an associate editor of country journal in harrisburg pa 
over the years the laws have become enormously tangled the 
catch and release philosophy only started about 50 years ago the 
hatchery approach is increasingly under fire especially by fly 
fishermen who put a higher aesthetic value on wild trout 
until the civil war americas rivers and streams were chock 
full of wild fish 
a guy could take home a hundred trout from one days fishing 
go back and do it again the next day and nobody noticed said 
schullery after the war there was an explosion in recreation and 
travel with expansion of the railroads the country grew up and 
growing access to the nations waters began emptying the streams of 
fish 
people realized they had to do something about it and the 
natural course was to begin stocking them with hatchery supplies 
in a lot of places there would have been no fish left without 
hatchery fish but now its a big bureaucracy 
hardcore fly fishermen disdain hatcheryraised trout claiming 
that only wild ones are tough fighters with pretty rainbowcolored 
scales and have a firm texture and pink tint to their flesh 
besides they say fish raised on hatchery chow taste mushy 
defenders counter that without the governments extensive 
stocking efforts thousands of anglers would never experience the 
thrill of landing a fish at all 
many new england states as well as new york and pennsylvania 
have long supported sports fisheries with public money a financial 
commitment that migrated slowly westward with the population 
since 1950 federal money also has been earmarked to improve and 
maintain fish habitats upgrade fishing and boating access and 
conduct research 
in 1984 the wallopbreaux fund named after sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo and rep john b breaux dla who introduced the 
measure in congress quadrupled the amount returning to the states 
the money comes from taxes on tackle motors boat fuel and 
import duties on sports fishing equipment and pleasure craft 
this year washington will give back through state fish and game 
departments more than 155 million in user fees to improve hobby 
fishing the funds are distributed on the basis of land and water 
area and the number of fishing licenses issued by each state 
the 1986 department of the interior survey indicated 64 million 
americans were fly fishermen john d randolph editor of fly 
fisherman magazine estimates 500000 of those are hardcore 
anglers with another million described as serious the rest 
are presumed to play at it 
trout unlimited has 450 us chapters and is affiliated with 
groups in canada japan france new zealand and the soviet union 
its stated mission is to protect and enhance the coldwater 
fishery of north america 
in the past four years it has spent 700000 on 135 projects to 
improve fish habitat and water conservation the 
embraceastream program which aims to get local communities 
involved in improving their own natural resources has been hailed 
as innovative and effective 
but lately tu has been casting its organizational net farther 
afield 
last year it signed two agreements with the union of hunting and 
fishing a 27 millionmember group which controls 85 percent of 
all land and water resources in the soviet union tu said the 
agreements call for exchanging research and management programs 
technical assistance and sportsmen 
tu reports the soviets and americans are working out details to 
allow us anglers to fish for arctic char in siberian waters and 
visit rivers running into the caspian sea where 40pound brown 
trout lie in wait 
in 1987 a small soviet delegation fished colorado waters union 
chief alexander ulitin said 
we should put reagan and gorbachev together in a bass boat and 
spread the papers out on the bottom then things would be better 
for as president herbert hoover once said 
fishing brings meekness and inspiration reduces our 
egotism soothes our troubles and shames our wickedness it is 
discipline in the equality of men for all men are equal before 
fish

from the flat high desert of western 
wyoming a traveler looks far back over his shoulder to see distant 
white clouds high in the northeastern sky 
but what seems to be clouds are actually peaks that soar 13000 
feet high and straddle the continental divide for 120 miles 
they are the wind river mountains and no one knows them better 
than finis rhymes with highness mitchell 
at 87 he is one of the few living americans to have a physical 
landmark 12482foot mitchell peak named after him by the us 
geological survey it was the governments way of thanking him for 
helping it correct topographical maps he has a nearperfect memory 
of the 2 million acres of the wind rivers public patrimony 
mitchell earned the sobriquet lord of the winds by hiking 
15000 miles climbing 276 peaks some two dozen times and 
amassing more than 100000 color slides of what he calls my back 
yard 
he also is responsible for some of the finest fishing in the 
world along with his wife emma his father and brother and a 
string of pack horses mitchell stocked 314 of the 4000 lakes in 
the wind rivers a half century ago from those the fish migrated 
to 700 others in the chain 
steep waterfalls and hostile terrain had previously kept them 
barren of fish since their creation 
these waters were all virgin and were just full of water lice 
leeches freshwater shrimp so those fish just gorged 
themselves mitchell wrote in his book wind river trails 
some of the brook trout weighed 3 pounds the third year 
today the wind river range is one of the finest highaltitude 
fisheries anywhere 
in 1906 when mitchells daddy traded 40 acres in missouri for 
160 acres at the foot of the wind rivers the family moved west in 
a boxcar with a wagon two mules a cow a dog and a few household 
treasures 
they arrived in rock springs on april 26 and headed north only 
to find their new land was worthless mitchells father started 
hauling freight at a penny a pound to feed his family and 
5yearold finis helped out from then on his life was a great 
adventure centered in the wind river mountains 
the cutthroat trout were the only fish in the wind rivers 
mitchell said they weighed about 12 pounds apiece there were no 
fish in the lakes unless somebody put them there we think 
sheepherders may have packed a few fish up there to have something 
to eat 
as a young man mitchell explored the mountains every chance he 
got but after marrying in 1925 he settled down in rock springs to 
work for the union pacific railroad 
in 1930 the great depression cost him his job and the couple 
took their chances living off the land after a bank failure wiped 
out their savings 
a hide buyer took us and all our stuff up into the 
mountains mitchell recalled i had 15 20 bills two went to 
the hide buyer and we were on our own 
we followed a wagon track left over from the sheepmens and 
cattlemens war of 03 when we got settled we decided to open a 
fishing camp we asked the forest service for a permit and they 
said fine we were the only ones doing it 
mrs mitchell cooked meals for 50 cents apiece her husband 
borrowed 10 horses from friends and charged 150 a day to rent 
them to fishermen soon folks from rock springs were coming up to 
mitchells fishing camp for some badly needed fun in those hard 
times 
only big sandy black joe dads and a couple other lakes had 
fish in them when we got started said mitchell 
on their own the mitchells began stocking more when 
superintendent bill rowley of the nearby daniel hatchery heard 
about it he came to see them 
he said to me finis if youre going to run a fishing camp 
you ought to stock other lakes too we dont have any money but 
well bring you the fish free if youll pack em into the 
mountains mitchell recalled 
rowleys hatchery was less than a decade old when he struck his 
deal with mitchell the state of wyoming provided a threeroom log 
cabin for the superintendent the hired hand and his wife and 
their six children 
today the hatchery uses trucks with oxygen tanks and elaborate 
cooling systems as well as helicopters to haul fish to lakes and 
streams mitchells and rowleys methods of transportion were more 
primitive 
in the old days we used 5gallon milk cans a dozen at a 
time he said the fish were an inch long and there were 1000 
in a can we covered the tops of the cans with burlap and steadied 
them by putting them in wooden apple crates which we tied to pack 
horses 
mrs mitchells job was to walk the horses around in circles as 
they arrived from the hatchery that was to keep the water 
splashing inside the cans distributing oxygen to the fish and 
keeping them from smothering 
the men would all go inside our camp tent and eat and leave me 
outside walking those pack animals she said recalling those 
days with good humor 
in 1939 the railroad recalled mitchell when the couple broke 
camp and left the wind rivers to return to rock springs they were 
4000 in debt but for free theyd stocked 25 million 
cutthroat rainbow in many isolated lakes every 
trout caught by a happy angler is directly descended from the ones 
finis and emma mitchell packed in 50 years ago 
trout multiplied into the millions only to reach weights of 4 
to 12 pounds and then die without seeing a single hook mitchell 
wrote in his book a small guide to the mountains which he sells 
through mail order from his home 
finis mitchell walks with the help of two sturdy sticks now but 
his aging legs havent kept him from going to the mountains every 
summer hes been honored by his state with an honorary doctorate 
of law and by his nation when the environmental protection agency 
gave him its outstanding achievement award 
but his biggest thrills still come in the wind rivers walking 
with young people 
children ask me who owns the mountains and im happy to tell 
them you own it mitchell said its true too 
to remind americans of their stewardship he writes in every 
copy of his book 
this is your wilderness 
take only pictures 
leave only footprints 
kill nothing but time

tucked away in a corner of the ritz 
sporting goods store across the room from a lunch counter 
surrounded by a covey of good ol boys drinking six cups of coffee 
on one quarter sits owner sam mavrakis 
when he isnt selling fishing licenses or tackle or swapping 
lies with the coffee drinkers hes holding court at the little 
table littered with beautiful bits of fur and feathers 
without looking up from his flying fingers mavrakis keeps up a 
running commentary about great fish hes known famous people hes 
guided and the merits of one trout stream over another 
but its not the colorful stories of visiting with prince philip 
or fishing with joe dimaggio that keep his audience enthralled 
its his flashing fingers mavrakis is one of the wests best 
artificial fly tiers every fly he sells in his store located in 
the heart of some of americas best fishing country is handtied 
and like thousands of other fishermen whove channeled their 
summertime love of fly fishing into wintertime fly tying he needs 
very specific materials to create fake critters to lure trout 
straight out of a river and onto a hook 
without realizing it mavrakis like fly tiers from japan to 
tasmania venezuela to iceland and all points in between is 
largely dependent on three men 
they are a wyoming elk hide tanner a new hampshire cotton 
spinner and a pennsylvania chicken farmer together they form the 
tripod of international fly tying because they provide nearly all 
the commercial raw materials needed to practice the art 
each stumbled into the lucrative business by accident 
steve kennerk owner of rocky mountain dubbing in riverton 
wyo was a hide tanner whose clientele dropped off because of his 
states depressed economy he now provides nearly all the wild 
animal hair used by foreign factories to manufacture the bulk of 
readymade artificial flies 
i export to 16 countries and have been named this years 
wyoming exporter of the year said kennerk whose tanning 
techniques are selftaught and secret 
last year i had gross sales of 225000 with 90 percent of my 
business now concentrated in providing hair for flies its growing 
about 40 percent a year 
he has a new catalog listing the 26 colors of the animal hair he 
tans and dyes including caribou australian possum deer elk 
moose and rabbit 
caught by surprise at the success of what started in 1981 as a 
sideline kennerk now has five fulltime employees and pays 16 
mentally handicapped youngsters to bag and label his products he 
also buys hides from local hunters who pump that money back into 
riverton and is doubling the size of his building 
ray merricks danville chenille co has been in business 55 
years it began by providing chenille a cotton yarn twisted 
together around a hard core for ladies hats and handbags but 
fashions changed and in the late 1950s when merricks family 
bought the new hampshire firm its product was popular mainly with 
hobbyists most chenille was then sold for novelty items such as 
pipe cleaners 
recently the boom in fly tying has created a whole new market 
for chenille which forms the body of the fly merricks company is 
now the worlds major supplier of the product named after the 
french word for caterpillar 
we grossed 550000 last year with all but 50000 of that 
from our fish and tackle business said merrick who employs 11 
fulltime and five parttime workers 
we have so many orders its going like crazy around here 
onethird of our sales are to fly factories in hong kong and 
singapore and to people in japan mauritius new zealand england 
australia all over 
buck metzs chicken hatchery in bellville pa anchors the 
third corner of the raw materials triangle 
his father grandfather and uncle started the chicken farm in 
the late 1930s 
it was a commercial poultry operation we raised chickens for 
meat and eggs said metz who now runs the hatchery with his 
brother john 
we got into providing specialty neck feathers because i needed 
them to tie my own flies and they were very hard to come by before 
us most of the hackles came hitandmiss from india and the 
philippines 
metz bought his first specialty chickens in 1972 from breeds 
that had been genetically modified to produce unique neck feathers 
my dad thought i was crazy when i paid 10000 for 150 
chickens he said 
last year that division of the family business took in nearly 
15 million while the farms regular chicken and egg sales 
totaled 3 million 
i realized within two years that there was an unknown level of 
demand out there for our hackle production said metz referring 
to the prized neck feathers of his pedigreed poultry 
weve been trying ever since to find out how big the market 
is but it keeps growing faster than we can keep up with it 
we have 35 distributors in europe asia and south america as 
well as here and were far and away the largest feather supplier 
to fly tiers in the world 
metz now employs 60 fulltime and 60 parttime workers to give 
his 100000 pampered chickens the individual care they require 
these are somewhat delicate birds prone to diseases more than 
commercial strains of poultry and each one has to be individually 
caged to protect them from each other he said 
kennerk merrick and metz all know about each other and their 
importance to fly tiers 
they have another thing in common theyre avid fly fishermen 
whore now so busy working they dont have time to go fishing 
anymore

in the beginning they were one but more and 
more garry shandling the character is leading a life apart from 
garry shandling the actor 
originally events from shandlings real life provided the comic 
fodder for its garry shandlings show which he calls a cross 
between a situation comedy and outer limits 
the set was built to look like shandlings house in the 
hollywood hills and his reallife experiences from girlfriend 
trouble to a doting mother were exaggerated and given a comic 
twist 
now he says weve broken away from real life weve had some 
hypothetical situations ive never been in i draw on attitudes 
but we greavu things and then imagineppqe an extension of the 
television show but it will be as offbeat

and nowhere else but in the theater says miss lansbury familiar 
to tv audiences as jessica fletcher on murder she wrote it

the best of broadway from the season just ending theyre andrew 
lloyd webbers the phantom of the opera stephen sondheims 
into the woods and a revival of cole porters anything goes 
the cbs producers of the awards presentations which will be 
televised from broadways minskoff theater invited miss lansbury 
back for a second year as hostess 
last year it intrigued and honored me enough that i felt i 
had to host it miss lansbury said by telephone from her home in 
southern california 
through my connection with murder she wrote i knew i was 
going to be welcome in the nations living rooms some people saw 
me glamorously gowned for the first time 
miss lansbury became known in hollywood at 17 became a star on 
broadway at 40 in mame and became a tv star at 59 as jessica 
fletcher who writes and solves mysteries

a taste of honey and anyone can whistle before she started 
winning tonys she has tonys for the musicals mame dear 
world gypsy and sweeney todd 
about her gown for this years show miss lansbury says 
thats a prime concern for a woman were going to try to outdo 
ourselves this year 
last year she appeared first in a gown of dramatically 
contrasting panels of black and white and later wore glittering 
gold 
im lucky enough to be gowned by bob mackie a great hollywood 
designer she says he created one of the most stunning gowns 
ive ever seen last year the blackandwhite creation 
its such a great dress i cannot let it hang in a bag in a 
closet im sure it will go into one of the hollywood museums if 
i can keep it away from my granddaughter shes a big 
dresserupper shes only 3 
my son her father is director anthony shaw he directed a 
lot of murder she wrote which is very nice my daughter has a

last year a tremendous amount of what i did say was me she 
says i told them i didnt want to get up there and spout a lot 
of things i wouldnt be comfortable saying i wanted to talk from 
the heart

we hope to start back aug 1 we have no way of knowing were in 
the midst of this dreadful strike people are rather grim about 
it 
at the end of next season miss lansbury says my fiveyear 
stint on murder she wrote will be over i cannot stay on a 
weektoweek basis perhaps we can work out an arrangement where i 
do several a year which would leave me free to do other things

especially when you get up in my years if youre still 
energetic which i am and still love working in the theater 
movies and tv you want to feel youve got some time to do it i 
really think im one of the luckiest people on two feet i do have 
tremendous stamina and energy

in what once was an evergreen forest 
thousands of workers are building a new town with stores 
apartments and houses for 30000 chernobyl nuclear plant workers 
and their families 
but those coming and going to work at chernobyl 30 miles to the 
west will have to pass first through a long metal building filled 
with rows of gray lockers and sensors with green and red lights 
in the building by the railroad tracks the sensors will check 
the workers for radioactive contamination the lockers will hold 
their work clothes 
every person much be checked said alexander gasenko deputy 
director of the kombinat agency that oversees the chernobyl plant 
and the area surrounding it 
more than 135000 people were evacuated from the zone around the 
nuclear plant after the explosion and fire april 26 1986 at 
chernobyls no 4 reactor at least 31 people were killed and a 
cloud of radioactive material eventually circled the globe 
pripyat once a city of 50000 within sight of the chernobyls 
towering stacks has become a nuclear ghost town 
its ninestory apartment buildings stand empty lamps with 
various colored shades remain in the window of a department store 
and spindly weeds grow on the lightbrown dirt brought in to 
replace the contaminated soil that was scraped off and buried 
the chernobyl plants 4400 workers and their families were 
hastily removed by a fleet of more than 1000 buses and scattered 
to new homes in kiev chernigov and cities of southern byelorussia 
but later this year if they want to continue to work at chernobyl 
they will have to move to slavutich each soviet nuclear power 
plant requires its personnel to live together in one city 
the few hundred people who began moving into slavutich in march 
are checked for radiation every time they travel to and from the 
plant 
one sensor checks them when they enter the long metal building 
they pick up their work clothes from their lockers walk through an 
open area to another sensor where they stand with their hands held 
high change their clothes and then walk out past a third sensor to 
the train that will take them to work 
when construction is finished shuttle trains will take the 
workers to their jobs at the nuclear power station in 34 minutes 
officials said on a recent press tour 
the officials said the area was slightly contaminated by fallout 
from the chernobyl accident but it poses no danger now for the new 
settlers 
the few residents on hand for the press tour agreed 
i think everything is all right said teacher lyudmila 
zabarina who has two young children i dont think its 
dangerous 
yuri and alexander young electricians from nearby chernigov now 
living temporarily in metal barracks in the nearby village of 
lesnoi said they were convinced the area was safe 
mayor alexander pankov said soviet authorities ordered the 
construction of the new town in october 1986 and set aside 650 
acres of land and 426 million rubles 680 million for the 
construction 
slavutich in the northern ukraine where it meets russia and 
byelorussia is being built by teams of workers from eight of the 
15 soviet republics 
estonian builders have put up small dark brown wooden houses 
houses built by the latvians are of red brick 
moscow and leningrad builders have put up large apartment 
complexes around remaining wooded areas 
one kindergarten is finished as is the school that will take an 
estimated 1200 students aged 6 to 17 in the fall 
mrs zabarina an english teacher said the school opened this 
spring with about a dozen teachers and 60 students 
basic food industries also will be built and their workers will 
also live in slavutich officials said 
but right now the roads are unpaved few buildings are finished 
and fewer are inhabited 
soviet workers are accustomed to such rush projects which have 
been a part of the economy for decades in the rapid 
industrialization beginning in the early 1930s whole cities were 
built in short spans of time for workers at the huge factories 
many such cities were poorly built but the new residents of 
slavutich expect their city to be different 
mrs zabarina whose husband works as an organizer for the 
communist youth organization said their previous town offered none 
of the cultural or sporting facilities of her new home 
im amazed she said it will be a beautiful city

from the gilded splendor of kremlin reception 
halls to a mockwestern hotel frequented by foreign businessmen and 
kgb prostitutes moscows busiest landmarks are being pressed into 
service for this weeks ussoviet summit 
president reagan soviet communist party general secretary 
mikhail gorbachev hundreds of staff workers and thousands of 
journalists will occupy just a few buildings in the city but their 
presence will be dominating 
the official meetings will take place in the kremlin seat of 
soviet power and although they dont live within the fortress 
walls the gorbachevs will give a state dinner there for the 
reagans who will be hosts for a reciprocal affair at their summit 
quarters the us ambassadors residence known as spaso house 
the official american entourage and much of the white house 
press accompanying reagan will be housed at the mezhdunarodnaya 
international hotel attached to the moscow center for 
international trade the hotel also will serve as headquarters for 
an international press corps now estimated to number at least 5000 
many of the visiting journalists will stay at the mammoth 
3200room rossiya hotel between red square and the kremlin 
although officials have said some outlying hotels also will be used 
to handle the flood of reporters photographers and technicians 
here are historical notes and descriptions of the principal 
summit venues

the deltashaped fortress that today encloses the soviet 
government and communist party leadership behind russet crenelated 
walls dates back to the 15th century at the site of a former 
white stone kremlin 
inside the kremlin walls bordered by the moscow river red 
square and the alexander gardens that run along bustling prospekt 
marx are a jumble of czarist palaces cathedrals government 
buildings and state museums including the armory which houses 
faberge eggs gold peter the greats high boots and other kremlin 
treasures and memorabilia 
the leaders will likely meet at some time during the summit in 
the roseandsilvercolored hall of st catherine a 19th century 
remnant of the russobyzantinestyle imperial residence that is now 
the grand kremlin palace 
the most stringent security measures in a capital known for 
caution are practiced at the kremlin where the three main gates 
are manned by dozens of uniformed kgb border guards and access even 
to the roads leading up to the gates is restricted 
during the meetings and festivities connected with the summit 
the broad stretches of asphalt and cobblestone between the historic 
buildings will be black with freshly polished zil limousines used 
to shuttle soviet dignitaries as well as the american vehicles 
that will be flown in for use by reagan and his senior staff

the yellow new empirestyle mansion which takes its name from 
the small spasopeskovskaya square out front and a nearby russian 
orthodox cathedral will house reagan his wife nancy and their 
personal staff during their fiveday stay in moscow 
the reagans will stay in the secondfloor guest quarters that 
had been known as the vice presidential suite but will be renamed 
in honor of its new guests according to us embassy press attache 
richard gilbert 
ambassador jack matlock and his wife rebecca plan to stay in 
their own quarters in the mansion for the presidential visit 
spaso house a twostory dwelling with a columned front portico 
was built in 1914 on the grounds inhabited in the 17th century by 
the czars dogkeepers and falconers its wealthy builder nikolai 
vtorov was killed shortly after the 1917 bolshevik revolution and 
the mansion was expropriated by the soviet government 
it was turned over to the united states in 1933 when william c 
bullitt arrived as the first us ambassador to the soviet union 
the mansion and its surrounding gardens have been the scene of 
raucous celebrations such as the one on christmas eve 1934 
recalled in charles w thayers book bears in the caviar when 
animals borrowed from the moscow zoo went beserk in the ballroom 
premier nikita khrushchev attended lawn parties there when he was 
still in power 
in world war ii a bomb shelter was built in the mansions 
basement and the ambassador and his staff evacuated to the volga 
river city of kuibyshev in late 1941 when german troops drew close 
to the city and air raids broke an occasional window 
the vaulted ceilings and doric columns that distinguish the 
interior are complimented by cream navy and mauve furnishings a 
collection of ultramodern art chosen by the matlocks hangs on 
the marble walls as part of the art in embassies program

the modern slategray towers of the americandesigned hotel and 
business complex known among foreigners as the mezh is an 
island of western life that is for the most part offlimits to 
soviet citizens 
the mezh derived from the russian word mezhdunarodnaya 
meaning international is so different from most soviet business 
and residential buildings that filmmakers use the interior to 
portray american venues in the 1985 film we accuse about the 
u2 spy plane s news agency says 5000 reporters have sought 
accreditation for the summit and the white house and soviet 
foreign ministry agreed the secondfloor congress hall was the only 
place in the city that could accommodate a press center even so

television and radio teams have built studio sets on the 
westwing balconies overlooking red square and the kremlim from 
which the nightly news on all four american networks will be

rooms in late 1966 and was completed in 1971 it has restaurants 
six bars a film theater and a concert hall 
fire struck the north wing feb 25 1977 and at least 30 people 
were killed an exploding television set in one of the rooms was 
blamed for a jan 8 1987 blaze that killed one woman 
the hotels location near the most popular sights of the soviet 
capital has made it a favorite with tourists for the past 20 years 
the familiar onion domes of st basils cathedral and a halfdozen 
small churches relocated to the site during construction projects 
around moscow stand in stark contrast to the modern steel glass

every evening around 7 the thudding 
rumbling and clashing that have filled the convention center for 
11 hours suddenly cease for 15 minutes theres silence 
then the organ swells spectators cheer gold curtains snap 
open and 200 bowlers their faces flushed with pride and 
embarrassment march up the center aisle flanked by 20 gleaming 
bowling alleys 
uh strike that we dont use alley anymore and hey get 
your mind out of the gutter take it from the american bowling 
congress gutter is out channel is in 
ask joe bowler and you get a different opinion 
a gutters a gutter says joe better known as 33yearold 
rick haemmerle of indianapolis chosen at random to represent 
bowlers everywhere he was crowned feb 13 opening day of the 85th 
annual abc tournament that ended in jacksonville last week 
question how long does it take 38000 bowlers from 50 states 
and nine foreign countries bowling 18 hours a day seven days a 
week to bowl 341430 games thereby toppling 58 million pins 
answer 103 days which is about 102 longer than it takes to 
realize that bowling is experiencing an identity crisis 
gutter or channel recreation or sport ralph kramden or ralph 
lauren 
dont be fooled by the plastic bowlerinaseashell the beer 
frame keychains and other doodads for sale at the tournament 
out on the lanes bowlings taking the high road no smoking no 
shorts no collarless shirts no drinking no hot dogs youre here 
to bowl not to eat 
whats gotten into bowling whered all that hightech equipment 
come from 
a black rubber ball in a zippered bag was good enough for ralph 
kramden today its three four five balls rubber balls 
urethane balls polyester balls in purple blue yellow for 
heavens sake carried in are you ready for this norton 
batteryheated insulated temperaturecontrolled bowling bags 
behold the modern bowling pin laminated on the outside holes 
on the inside the slightest tap and its to the moon alice 
consider the lane spread a little oil on todays 
urethanecoated surfaces and its bang zoom to the pocket alice 
nah i dont practice says joe bowler if youre not 
hitting your shot you just buy another ball i carry five of the 
urethanes 
alas five arent always enough in his first official act joe 
bowler opened the tournament with a gutterball what do you want 
from a guy forced to bowl in front of 2234 people while wearing a 
robe and a crown 
bowlings split personality begins to make sense when you 
consider that theres bowling the sport and then theres bowling 
the game 
bowling the sport is math physics and sophisticated terms like 
coefficient of friction and kinetic energy 
bowling the game is nachos chili dogs and simple terms like 
miller and bud 
unlike the sport the game has no image problem it couldnt 
care less an attitude that irks the sport no end 
let the sport compile all those demographics about how 
youngbrightaffluent its 68 million participants are let it lie 
awake nights worrying about the impression it makes 
the game has better things to do like order another 
cheeseburger 
the american bowling congress gatekeeper of the sport and 
recipient of 10 million in dues from 34 million league bowlers 
stresses skill complexity pride and tradition 
the national bowling council the industrys advertising arm 
and amf and brunswick its largest manufacturers stress leisure 
recreation and fun fun fun 
eddie wise a 9yearold who pushed his bowling ball twohanded 
to a nearperfect 299 was immortalized in the early 80s in a 
brunswick ad promoting easytotopple pins in the same era the 
young american bowling alliance put an orangutan on the cover of 
its magazine and the national bowling council enthusiastically 
promoted a real people segment featuring a bowling pig 
fun for all ages anyone can play you dont have to be good 
you dont have to be a grownup you dont even have to be human 
bowlings critics say its going to the dogs 
its kingpins say its going to the olympics 
whats a swell game like bowling doing in a mess like this 
it didnt get there overnight 
the ancient egyptians were bowlers its been traced back to 
5200 bc 
germans bowled in the 6th century martin luther in the 16th in 
those days the game was called ninepins lawn bowling in 
england where henry viii banned it as a form of vicious 
gambling 
no respect even then 
lawn bowling and skittles a dutch game got a warm welcome 
in the new world where tavern owners embraced them as a way to 
boost beer sales 
it didnt take long for gambling charges to resurface prim and 
proper connecticut banned ninepins in the late 1830s that might 
have been the end of that had not some enterprising soul 
evidence points to one jonathan coe of madison conn 
circumvented the law by adding a 10th pin bowling was legalized in 
1841 
like other german immigrants bowling headed west in the 19th 
century it settled in the midwest still bowlings stronghold with 
michigan no 1 
bowling generally thrives wherever bluecollar and shift workers 
are found if you work from 7 to 5 you dont have time for 
daylight sports like golf or tennis bowling is something you can 
do at night says steve harding a bowler who owns a pizzeria in 
sherman texas 
almost from the beginning wouldbe bureaucrats descended on 
bowling bent on organizing standardizing and merchandizing what 
was until the late 1800s a haphazard affair involving however 
many pins of whatever shapes and sizes happened to be on hand 
that all changed in 1895 when the american bowling congress 
first met in new york formed to represent bowlers interests the 
abc quickly adopted the 300point scoring system and set uniform 
standards for pins balls and lanes 
and what did it get for its trouble it got trouble 
the bickering started almost immediately high scores vs high 
standards commercial interests vs bowler interests sport vs 
game 
bad press dogged bowling from the beginning ever read rip van 
winkle only to be replaced many years later by something 
infinitely worse no press at all 
legislators picked on bowling in some states it was illegal 
for minors to walk to or from a bowling alley unless accompanied by 
an adult those laws were repealed in the 1950s 
by that time bowling had reached new heights of respectability 
the glamorous beer teams touring the country in their allwhite 
goodguy outfits helped boost bowlings image along with sales of 
strohs falstaff budweiser and pfeiffer automatic pinspotters 
brought respectability just as the national child labor committee 
was about to crack down on the low pay and late hours given 
erstwhile pinboys and women developed an affinity for the game 
prompting proprietors to class up the joints 
as ralph kramden went so went the nation between the mid 40s 
and the mid 60s the number of league bowlers quadrupled 
suddenly everyone was going bowling 45 million people 
regularly in abcsanctioned leagues

from 1955 to 1960 membership in the womens international 
bowling congress rose by 150 percent 
entrepreneurs were quick to spring into action a little too 
much action it turned out 
in 1944 there were 38203 bowling lanes 
by 1964 there were 159079 
so ended the competitive era of bowling so began the 
commercial era so says dr george allen of tempe ariz a 
former college professor with four decades of involvement in 
bowling and a phd in finance 
hes also the author of two scholarly volumes on industry trends 
that combine a desire to drag bowlings leaders behind the woodshed 
with a penchant for capital letters no industry or organization 
has an inherent right to exist forever he writes 
allen considers bowling a sport and hed like you to actually 
what hed really like is for you to consider it a microcosm of 
life itself but what the heck hes a reasonable guy 
besides this is no time to argue bowling allen warns 
is on the verge of extinction done in by bouncy pins and 
urethane balls with builtin hooking power unscrupulous lane 
conditions and greedy commercial interests 
if its true that the sport of bowling is dying allen thinks 
the business of bowling is whats killing it we have eroded the 
integrity of the sport of bowling to create the recreation of 
bowling according to the text of a speech to the bowling 
proprietors association of america in 1986 
meanwhile recreational bowlers are scoring up a storm 
the same 213 average that made one detroiter the highestranked 
bowler in his league in 1987 puts him between 50th and 60th on this 
years roster 
consider the perfect game 12 strikes for a score of 300 once 
so rare that the abc gave a 14carat gold ring to anyone who 
managed to pull it off 
today the same ring costs a bowler 350 the free ones are 
silverplated a good thing for the abc considering the number of 
perfect games bowled last year 8537 up from 1375 a decade ago 
honor scores in general 300 299 or 298 for a single game or 
800 for a threegame series totaled 21022 for 1987 exceeding 
the totals for 1977 1978 and 1979 combined 
during a single day of competition at a tournament in hartford 
conn in april there were four perfect games 
kathy mcbride who works the counter at bowlera lanes in 
hammond ind still remembers the excitement of the centers first 
300 game it was a big day of course that was five years ago 
so far this year weve had six 
at bowlera 180 used to be considered a high average now 
were seeing 225 averages last year my own family brought home 16 
trophies finally i told them enough 
bill taylor of pasadena calif has had enough too taylor is 
a selfappointed guardian of the sports integrity whats left of 
it anyway 
hed sooner lock bowling in its room than let it strut its stuff 
as scheduled in a oneday exhibition the day before opening 
ceremonies at the summer olympics in seoul 
bowling is not going to any parties until it cleans itself 
up vows taylor a former pro coach who now manufactures his own 
line of honest pins and lane finishes products he insists 
would solve the whole problem products he claims the abc refuses 
to approve the abc says hes never asked 
bowling says taylor has become a lowlife game a 
24yearold with a 227 average just bowled his 14th career 300 
game if the great bowlers of the past were here instead of in 
their graves they would shoot him 
a bowling lane today is the equivalent of a concave golf green 
with a 36inch cup contends taylor who using a speed trap of 
his own invention recently clocked a bowling pin at 42 feet per 
second in the old days they traveled 16 feet 17 feet per 
second now theyre flying all over the deck 
next to bouncy pins nothing makes taylor madder than 
blocked lanes 
oil is applied to bowling lanes to protect them from the 
friction of the landing ball as well as to provide a skid area 
thereby enabling the ball to follow the skidrollhook pattern 
required for effective delivery 
how to apply that protective coating is infinitely more 
complicated 
taylor believes and he has lots of company that 
lessthanscrupulous bowling centers have learned how to place 
oil on the lanes to reguide errant shots into the pocket this lane 
blocking along with todays powerful balls has made bad bowlers 
appear good we have horrible bowlers now 
not so says wally hall vice president of the bowling 
proprietors association of america and chairman of fairlanes corp 
which owns 4000 lanes more than any other chain 
what we have today is an extremely skilled sport technical 
improvements may well have helped but i do not agree that todays 
bowlers arent as good 
some proprietors not the majority but a few are using oil 
as a marketing strategy hall concedes but the average bowler 
isnt able to exploit those conditions 
the oil crisis has been under closer scrutiny than opec by the 
evervigilant abc whose previous efforts to resolve it have 
succeeded only in further depleting its stock of honorscore rings 
we want to see any rule change result in a condition that is 
fair and competitive to all bowlers and that will leave the pride 
of accomplishment in the hands of the bowlers instead of the 
maintenance people abc assistant secretarytreasurer burt 
kellermann says through clenched teeth 
at the tournament in jacksonville lanes were constantly 
monitored to ensure the same conditions for each bowler as well as 
to prevent lanes from becoming blocked 
this meticulous maintenance may have accounted for both the low 
numbers on the scoreboard and the long faces in the parking lot 
a lot of people take bowling too seriously confides joe 
bowler whose mother went bowling the night she gave birth to him 
mom was tough i grew up with head down dont bend your wrist 
keep your damn shoulder up she used to be a killer now shes in 
it for fun 
for what its worth joe bowler has never done well at the abc 
tournament either but no matter how bad you do you always come 
back 
indeed bowling badly at the championships is an annual 
tradition right up there with the march up the center aisle and 
the crowning of joe bowler 
like todays bowling pins bowlers are mighty resilient 
conditions are always rough confirms joe ahler of bay city 
mich whose 50th tournament appearance won him a diamond lapel pin 
and warm applause when he marched up the aisle in april 
the organist played over the rainbow ahler bowled 177 
like 60 percent of this years bowlers hes planning to try 
again next year when the tournament moves to wichita kan 
its an impossible tournament says jim wagner of joliet 
ill but you keep wondering whens your lucky year gonna come 
one of these days alice

it was only a matter of time before the 
dirty dozen arrived as a weekly series 
fox broadcasting co recently snatched it up and a cast and 
crew from mgm is busy recreating this fantasy version of world war 
ii on location in yugoslavia 
it began as a hit movie in 1967 with an allstar cast and nbc 
revived it three times once with lee marvin reprising his movie 
role as the tough goodguy leader and twice with telly savalas 
who played a bad guy in the original movie as the leader 
its a great concept take a bunch of convicted murders offer 
them an outside chance of freedom and send them off on a suicide 
mission against the nazis the bad guys suddenly become the 
underdogs and capture audience sympathy 
everybodys happy except the germans who reportedly are a 
little miffed at once again being the patsies in a war film 
theyre the classic underdogs said executive producer john 
furia jr in a telephone interview from zagreb yugoslavia 
theyve made mistakes of various kinds and are looking to redeem 
themselves by heroic action 
ben murphy stars in the weekly series which fox began running 
saturdays last month he plays lt danko the head of the group 
but this time hes also a convicted felon danko assaulted a 
colonel he says was responsible for getting 80 of his men killed in 
combat 
dankos a nononsense career soldier who doesnt want to be 
there but doesnt know what else to do said murphy also 
speaking from yugoslavia its sort of the story of my 
experience ive never done a series where life imitated art so 
much its like going to war for a year you leave home go to 
another country 
our accommodations are better than barracks but the 
filmmaking process is very much like being in the army you have 
periods of hurry up and wait then periods of intense work i think 
its the toughest show on television in terms of manhours 
hardships and the effort that goes into it 
furia said zagreb is like a big studio backlot because of its 
old buildings various architectural styles cobbled streets and 
variety of countryside just outside the city 
there arent many places left in europe that still look like 
the 1940s said furia in addition yugoslavia has a lot of 
equipment military and otherwise from the period its very 
economical to shoot here we have an excellent local film crew 
our shows are a combination of melodrama actionadventure and 
strong characters we have a good cast and the luxury of being able 
to tell many different kinds of stories within the framework of the 
series weve done stories on teenage partisans the cossacks of 
eastern europe and one that was supposed to be set on an island off 
scotland 
the show also stars john slattery jon tenney john diaquino and 
john bradley that doesnt add up to a dozen but various guest 
actors are brought in for each episode theyre usually casualties 
by the end of the show 
danko keeps a certain distance from his men because of rank 
and age but theres also a comraderie said murphy hes a 
40yearold lieutenant ive been in four war movies and in one 20 
years ago i played a lieutenant ive never gone beyond that in 
rank in the winds of war i was a navy lieutenant 
murphy said he spends his off time playing tennis with his 
yugoslavian buddies they have nice courts here he said we 
found one the other day on an army base my buddies talked our way 
in if i can play tennis a few times a week i have few problems 
being anywhere 
yugoslavia has become a major film site in recent years the 
sequel to the great escape was also filming there war and 
remembrance had been there earlier the movie high road to 
china and an nbc miniseries on mussolini were also filmed there 
they make a lot of world war ii movies on their own said 
furia so theyre used to our special effects bombs and the 
machine guns were blowing up so many buildings and trucks i 
sometimes think were laying waste to half of europe 
furia is an old hand at working abroad in recent years hes 
produced rage of angels in france and mexico the sun also 
rises in spain and france and we are the children in kenya 
dirty dozen the series began filming in yugoslavia last 
december and will not complete 13 episodes until july it takes 10 
days to make each episode

on the first weekend of every 
month thousands of art lovers take a walk on the wild side through 
some of south africas loveliest farmland 
its the crocodile ramble stretching 28 miles near honeydew a 
village in the minkandmanure belt so called because of the 
areas wealthy horsekeeping inhabitants 
civil servants from government offices in pretoria businessmen 
from johannesburg and young families getting their first taste of 
serious art walk and drive along dirt trails through cow pastures 
and bush artists and craftsmen open their workshops and chat with 
all comers about form color and price 
visitors who dont buy can still enjoy coffee wine and light 
lunches bands play hotair balloons float overhead water 
sportsmen head for hartebeespoort dam a nearby lake enthusiasts 
of early humans prowl among the caves at sterkfontein a few miles 
away 
zulu tribesmen dance for tourists in a kraal of treebranch 
walls set up by a local hotel 
artists have lived for decades in the gentle hills around the 
crocodile river their thatched houses secluded but still close to 
showrooms in johannesburg 
the idea of the ramble came a year ago to potter tim morris and 
his wife marlene who specializes in bonsai 
art should be accessible to everybody including people who 
are frightened of going into a gallery children should be 
confronted with art morris said 
the problem with this society is its flush and its plastic 
people are susceptible to easy forms of entertainment beer 
rugby braais cookouts and video its essential that these 
things are counterbalanced 
morris encouraged some 25 friends to open their studios to the 
public once a month creating a vast attraction for both 
connoisseurs and tourists 
property values soared jewelrymaker debbie scrimgeour bought 
her farm for 90000 just before the ramble opened and said its 
now worth 170000 
some artists uncomfortable dealing with the public dropped 
out others welcomed their freedom from the demands of galleries 
which take up to 40 percent of selling prices and found new 
customers by taying home morris said he took in 2500 on a recent 
weekend 
in a country where nearly all human endeavors are affected by 
the prolonged conflict over apartheid the ramble remains a 
nonpolitical patch of western taste set incongruously in the 
african countryside the artists and craftsmen are white some born 
in europe some incorporate african themes in their work others 
such as morris draw on northern hemisphere traditions 
the only studio devoted to black african art was hit by 
lightning and burned down in february 
the success of white farmers and artists masks poverty among 
black seasonal farm workers residents say scrimgeour said a 1987 
survey by a local church listed 25 percent of black children under 
6 years old as dangerously malnourished she said the ramble has 
increased black employment 
the ramble includes owen wood who charges up to 3500 for his 
handforged knives woods wife sue paints on silk muralist 
mickey korzennik spent decades decorating corporate headquarters 
before he lost a contract he had pursued for a year the 
disappointment made him rethink his life and his art 
now i stay here and do what i want and let people respond 
he said his large wood and steel sculptures sell for up to 8000 
henry yatt a furniture designer and his wife fiona an 
interior decorator opened a gallery of paintings by a friend 
peter nel who died three years ago 
we had about 60 of them and at first we didnt know what to 
do yatt said now theyre being sold and when theyre all 
gone im not sure what will happen 
sarie saunders sells unglazed ceramic birds and plant holders 
and small bronze animals at a farm thats been in her family for 
100 years 
peter worsley produces rustic furniture i employed 52 people 
in a twostory factory in johannesburg he said then a 
customer brought me to the crocodile river and i saw what i was 
missing geese charging around the garden dogs playing i had 
lost out on life 
i sold my house and almost everything i had and bought a farm 
here i became a oneman business again and have only 10 people 
working for me now living since then has been total bliss

the songs on thomas dolbys new album bear 
little resemblance to the synthpop sound of his biggest hit she 
blinded me with science and thats just the way he wants it 
every song ive ever written has been different from every other 
one dolby says thats one of my rules of thumb i like to 
break ground with every song i write 
aliens ate my buick is dolbys third album with music 
ranging from reggae to pop to funk he hopes no one will identify 
him with a particular sound 
that can be a terrible trap to fall into he said i am 
very fortunate to have a wide musical vocabulary i can use any 
musical idiom to make a point 
dolby an englishman who now lives in los angeles calls himself 
a satirist and relates to such musicians as frank zappa and george 
clinton whose song hot sauce appears on aliens dolby 
pokes fun at men and women at americans and especially at himself 
the songs are like tommy goes to hollywood a journal of an 
englishman who goes to america he said in an interview 
the first single is called airhead 
the song is about one specific female from firsthand 
experience he said the big crime is that the lady behaves 
like an airhead even though she has a brain 
dolbys concern about how women would feel about airhead was 
eased when a friend showed him some lyrics for a song called 
bonehead 
its about a guy who wears all the right clothes i read them 
and i was in fits of hysterics dolby said it occurred to me 
do i feel insulted as a man by these lyrics no theyre not 
about men theyre about a stereotype its making fun of the 
stereotype 
the only complaints ive had have been from men 
dolby has worked with a number of artists including joni 
mitchell joan armatrading foreigner and def leppard he is 
intrigued by the idea of producing a relatively new artist 
id really like to take a raw talent like terence trent darby 
and mold him he just doesnt have the experience to optimize his 
talent dolby said there are a lot of people who are at the 
top of the strata who are good at optimizing the little talent they 
have id like to get the opposite side 
on the aliens lp actor ed asners voice can be heard 
shouting murder on my brain is like a sieve robin leach 
the host of televisions lifestyles of the rich and famous 
introduces the albums first song key to her ferrari 
i was looking for a good attitude to begin the album dolby 
said he leach has a production office in los angeles for 
lifestyles so i sent him a tape and he really liked the song 
aliens was produced by dolby and bill bittrell who worked 
on michael jacksons latest album bad 
they had a good dozen engineers working on that album said 
dolby everybody said the most creative and sweetest to work with 
was bill bittrell 
dolbys first album the golden age of wireless was 
released in 1982 and included she blinded me with science 
dolby toured in 1984 after the release of his second album flat 
earth but had difficulty reproducing the sound from his studio 
recordings he does not anticipate that problem when he tours this 
summer 
the songs on this album lend themselves a lot more easily to 
being performed live he said theyre a lot more 
groovebased 
dolby will tour with the band he used on aliens although 
los angeles is famous for having big name session players dolby 
auditioned unknown musicians to play on his new album 
i was looking to find some people with enthusiasm the la 
lifestyle is not conducive to challenging music he said there 
are a lot of musicians who are technically proficient but dont 
seem to do it with that much conviction 
i was determined to turn up some fresh talent i wanted people 
who were good players but had some hunger 
the success of she blinded me with science was helped 
considerably by the accompanying video which received heavy 
airplay on music television dolby says he often writes with visual 
images in mind 
ill have a picture in my head from a magazine or a book 
sometimes a scene from a movie dolby said sometimes im 
already thinking ahead to the videos

as the new kid on the literary block michael 
chabon should have plenty of tips for aspiring writers after his 
first novel earned him a recordbreaking 155000 advance 
the 24yearold wunderkind doesnt have any words of wisdom 
though getting the mysteries of pittsburgh published was just 
plain luck he tells fledgling authors somewhat sheepishly his 
comingofage novel was actually his masters thesis 
an unsuspecting chabon turned it in last year to a professor at 
the university of california at irvine who instead of critiquing 
the manuscript sent it to his agent the agent was impressed as 
was william morrow amp co which offered 155000 for the hardcover 
rights 
since its april release the mysteries of pittsburgh has 
jumped onto bestseller lists with 130000 hardback copies in 
print foreign rights have been sold to editors in 13 countries and 
bids for the paperback rights are in the six figures a movie deal 
also is in the works 
the book is about a gangsters mildmannered son who spends the 
summer after college graduation with new flashy friends including 
a young woman and man who vie for his affections the protagonist 
like chabon attended the university of pittsburgh and the drama 
unfolds in this city 
to me its the first novel it has all the weaknesses of 
first novels i mean its the first time i ever tried to write a 
book the slim softspoken chabon said on a recent visit here 
the pricetag is irrelevant he said because it seems so 
inflated to me i just cant correlate it with the worth of the 
book all i ever really wanted was just to get my book published 
or get a book published 
always an avid reader chabon decided while growing up in 
maryland he was going to become a writer he honed his talents at 
pitt where he received a bachelors degree in 1984 
after living in paris six months he applied to the twoyear 
writing program at irvine he began working on the mysteries of 
pittsburgh in may 1985 in preparation for graduate school that 
fall 
i just thought there are going to be all these serious 
writers there real writers and ill bet theyre all working on 
novels and ive just been doing short stories he recalled 
by the time he arrived in irvine chabon had written 100 pages 
80 of which he quickly scrapped over the next 1 years he spent 
every evening working on the book required for his master of fine 
arts degree 
he took his title from the mysteries of paris by 
19thcentury french novelist eugene sue i substituted the word 
pittsburgh and i went ooooh neat he said 
chabon finished the 297page novel in february 1987 and eager 
for some feedback dropped off the manuscript with novelist and 
english professor donald heiney three days later he was informed 
a copy of his thesis was on its way to heineys agent in new york 
it didnt look like student work it had the look of 
professional work heiney said 
a month later nine publishing houses took part in an auction 
for the rights 
chabon is unimpressed and in fact feels downright 
uncomfortable with all the praise 
i like what im writing when im writing it and for about two 
weeks thereafter it has a very short halflife in my esteem he 
said laughing after that im even assailed by intense doubts 
no amount of praise from other people can convince me of the worth 
of what ive done 
theres entire stretches of the novel that i cant read 
without wincing i say ooooh why did i say that its so 
clumsy 
chabon has since sold several short stories to the new yorker 
and other magazines hes working on a second novel as well as the 
screenplay for the mysteries of pittsburgh to be directed by 
alan j pakula of all the presidents men and sophies 
choice 
despite his good fortune chabon has made few changes in the 
quiet life he leads in newport beach calif with his wife 
lollie 32 an english doctoral student and poet their splurges 
include a new car a color television and a honeymoon in italy 
our strategy has been pretty much the same he said we 
just basically pretend that its not really happening 
naturally though its all real and im just still me

singersongwriter larry groce says his 
1976 novelty hit tune junk food junkie was a prelude to some of 
the music he has performed on his radio show mountain stage 
the twohour program originating from the capitol plaza theater 
in charleston wva is carried by about 125 national public radio 
stations across the country 
the show similar to the defunct prairie home companion 
features an eclectic group of performers who sing country 
bluegrass folk blues jazz and classical others recite poetry or 
tell their favorite stories 
groce as host of the show has performed a routine in which he 
intertwines the names of country music stars and song titles with 
the names of classical music greats 
he has introduced numbers such as george friedrich jones 
bourbon and water music waylon wagners mommas dont let 
your babies grow up to be valkyries and johann sebastian bach 
owens branding iron concertos 
to sing some of them he has assumed the identity of plastico 
flamingo 
although the show focuses more on music than on humor the 
40yearold groce says junk food junkie was similar to the 
spoofs he has been doing on the program 
it gave a preview of that he said in an interview from his 
rural home near philippi wva i poked fun at organic food and 
junk food eaters 
im fairly knowledgeable about country music and sort of 
knowledgeable about classical i like to hit both targets ive 
done this in the past 
in junk food junkie which groce wrote he sang about eating 
natural food such as yogurt by day and enjoying a genuine junk 
food high at night he rattled off a list of his favorite 
munchies in a tune that caught the public fancy like few others 
i had always admired satire and humor in songs he recalled 
i had written others like it satires of common american 
things i felt this was a natural 
i poked fun at myself and i had no idea so many others fell 
in the syndrome i do the response was more than i thought it would 
be it got a lot of exposure in the press because of the odd nature 
of the song 
he wrote the tune based on his experiences while working in an 
organic restaurant in new york after work the cooks would go 
out and get a hamburger he said 
the peculiarity of the song tended to stereotype him he said 
i like the song its clever and im not ashamed of it but 
they assume youre an oddball and cant sing actually my career 
has been based on singing 
since the hit he has been the opening act on concert tours 
performed to smaller audiences in coffeehouses and worked in arts 
programs 
i did pretty much what anyone does whos not a big star 
groce said 
included in his work are a halfdozen albums for the walt disney 
co including two volumes of disneys childrens favorites 
that sold 2 million each 
they havent made me famous but they are known quite a bit 
he said 
hes just completed a special for the disney channel on cable 
tv larry groce in concert 
hes been doing mountain stage since 1984 first on west 
virginia public radio and then branching out coasttocoast in july 
1986 
groce says mountain stage stresses music more than prairie 
home companion in which host garrison keillor touted his 
fictional minnesota town lake wobegon 
we do very different things he said we tend to feature 
music and showcase the performers they are the star of the show as 
much as our regulars ours is a little more of a true variety show 
where the guests take a bigger role we give them much more time 
and our show is not so much anchored in me 
guests have included bluegrass acts such as the doug dillard 
band from the andy griffith show comedy by dr demento poetry 
by allen ginsberg blues by roy bookbinder country music by kathy 
mattea classical music by the montani string quartet and jazz by 
the bob thompson trio 
this show takes chances and its on the frontier of music in 
certain ways groce said we specialize in singers and writers 
to a great degree we dont tell them how to act how to look or 
what to sing they appreciate that theres no pretense we just do 
it 
our role is to get people who are trend setters even though 
they may not be wellknown 
he still gets the inevitable question what is your favorite 
junk food these days 
i stick with my old favorites like dr pepper and cheetos i 
also am kind of addicted to peanut butter crackers actually 
anything with sugar in it he said

much has been written about how crucial willow is to the 
fortunes of its producers mgm attempting a comeback as a viable 
film company and george lucas still recovering from the bomb of 
howard the duck 
the boxoffice results arent in yet but both mgm and lucasfilm 
can be proud of their achievement willow is movie storytelling 
in the grand tradition 
no it isnt a landmark film such as lucas star wars the 
kind of achievement that happens once a decade much of willow 
may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special effects movies of 
recent years or to animated classics from disney 
but willow stands on its own merits as high adventure 
executed with superior imagination 
the reluctant hero willow warwick davis is a young farmer 
who dwells with his wife and two children in a village of little 
people in a place that never existed a time that never was 
willow finds a baby floating in a river a very special baby who 
will threaten the throne of the evil queen bavmorda jean marsh 
she orders her warriors to find and kill the baby 
the villages high aldwin billy barty assigns willow to take 
the baby to the good castle of tir asleen and the perilous trek 
begins willow encounters endless dangers but he finds allies in 
the overthehill warrior madmartigan val kilmer a pair of 
brownies kevin pollak and rick overton a good sorceress 
patricia hayes and eventually the bad queens daughter joanne 
walley 
george lucas provided the story of willow and bob dolmans 
script reflects lucas penchant for highly developed fantasies the 
richness of detail contributes to credibility as does ron howards 
straightforward direction as an actor himself howard manages to 
protect his performers from being overwhelmed by the special 
effects 
the resulting performances lend strength to willow davis is 
a natural his compelling innocence providing the basic core of the 
film kilmer has the whimsy and daredevil spirit of errol flynn 
and walley could be his olivia de havilland but with even more 
spunk 
marsh is equally as fearsome as the queen in snow white and 
the seven dwarfs and veteran barty is a commanding presence as 
the leader of the little people 
only in the latter portions does the film falter the storming 
of the castle complete with selfgenerating monsters and the 
climactic battle between the sorceresses could be trimmed 
nigel wool produced willow with lucas as executive 
producer the rating is pg with much to scare small children 
running time 125 minutes

serious slammin rca pointer sisters 
 
side 1 of the pointer sisters latest album is awful dance 
music as mindless and soulless as anything that surfaced in the 
disco craze of the 1970s 
the sisters redeem themselves a bit on the second side of 
serious slammin still its hard to believe this is the same 
group that turned out one of the decades best pop records 
breakout just five years ago 
one problem with serious slammin is that june anita ruth 
and producer richard perry havent changed their formula a bit 
since breakout and the sisters sound tired of it theyre 
still singing uptempo dance tunes over synthesizers and drum 
machines and for a change of pace mixing in steamy ballads over 
synthesizers and drum machines 
another reason for the droopy energy level could be the 
material all provided by outside writers the tunes are tuneless 
the lyrics lame the nadir is shut up and dance which begins 
all i want to do with you is dance i dont need no verbal 
expose there must have been something else the pointer sisters 
could have recorded instead 
when the songs are decent so is serious slammin 
my life which opens side 2 is the first cut that creates 
any kind of rhythmic momentum the midtempo i will be there 
which closes the record deserves a place alongside such past hits 
by the group as slowhand and fire alas most of serious 
slammin is pointless sisters

that special part of me mca onaje allan gumbs 
 
onaje allan gumbs is unknown despite the company he keeps the 
veteran producer composer and pianist has worked with such jazz 
artists as woody shaw nat adderley stanley jordan and billy 
cobham but that special part of me is his first album in more 
than a decade 
much of the record is terrific jazz is the common thread 
although there are also elements of pop and rhythm amp blues gumbs 
writes melodies that give his instrumentals instant appeal and yet 
the improvisations particularly by gumbs on piano are intricate 
and reward listeners who play the record through more than once 
there are few frills but plenty of variety in the arrangements 
shadowlight features a trio and gives gumbs a chance to 
stretch the keith jarrettlike the dancer is gumbs playing one 
grand piano part overdubbed on another 
the r amp b influence comes into play on the title cut and quiet 
passion which find a groove and stay there 
the pop element however is incorporated with less success 
gumbs makes muzak with his cover of didnt i blow your mind this 
time while all my love for you the only tune featuring 
vocals unfortunately sounds like a duet between dionne warwick and 
donnie osmond 
aside from the two awry crossover ventures that special part 
of me represents a welcome and successful try by gumbs for a 
higher profile

in october 1986 the paramount publicity 
department needed a hard sell to persuade journalists to interview 
an australian pitchmanturnedactor named paul hogan no problem 
now 
what made the difference was crocodile dundee a surprise 
blockbuster that grossed 175 million in the united states and 
canada and did comparable business wherever it played now hogans 
back with crocodile dundee ii which he swears will be the 
end of the outback adventurer 
ive completed the circle he said the new one is a good 
movie it stands up all by itself its the end of crocodile 
dundee 
yes im sure ill be asked the same questions in three years 
and five years like what if 10 million people write you and say 
they want to see more thats getting a bit unfair 
the challenge now is to come up with another character that 
surpasses crocodile dundee that doesnt mean ill start playing 
the hunchback of czechoslovakia i wont stretch credibility too 
far 
his remarks will be filed for future reference remember when 
sean connery said no more james bond remember never say never 
again 
if the success of crocodile dundee has changed paul hogan 
its not visible he remains the same wry laidback observer of 
the passing scene 
can he really be just plain paul hogan any more 
yes he said in my home i can im there as often as 
possible when i work i work seven days a week however long it 
takes when i finish the job i disappear off the planet then i 
become bored with myself very quickly and i go back 
about the only places where he can now travel freely he 
admitted are the soviet union and china six months from now it 
may be different but i dont really want to go to russia anyway 
hogan recently talked about the origins of crocodile ii 
i decided about the time i finished no 1 he said in the 
back of my head i thought id like to see this go further id like 
to see this character get in real trouble the first one was mostly 
a smallbrackets adventure a comedy and a love story with a little 
adventure 
i thought id like to do a high adventure if i could make it 
better than the first one 
in the new film dundees girlfriend linda kozlowski becomes 
the target of south american drug dealers after escaping death 
attempts in new york the pair flee to the australian outback the 
villains pursue them and dundee faces seemingly insuperable odds 
the script was written by hogan and his oldest son brett hogan 
said they made a good combination we were like a team writing 
songs one writing the lyrics and the other the music he writes 
very much in story lines and i write in scenes 
the paul hogan story is the kind that makes the film business 
ever so fascinating who could figure that an australian tv 
comedian would become an international star with one movie hogan 
didnt even start out to be an entertainer he was making 75 a 
week as a workman on sydneys harbour bridge in 1972 when a buddy 
dared him to appear on the down under version of the gong show 
the object of new faces was to humiliate the contestants 
hogan turned the tables and ripped them to pieces people all 
over the country loved seeing me get revenge i was an overnight 
sensation 
soon he became partners with john cornell who directed dundee 
ii in the paul hogan show which drew high ratings and was 
syndicated in the united states and 30 other countries 
hogan became a familiar face here with his commercials for 
australian beer and tourism so many visitors came to australia 
that facilities were overtaxed hogan is no longer pitching his 
native land we dont want tourists sleeping in tents he said 
a visit to new york in 1984 planted the seed for crocodile 
dundee fishing with friends in the northern territory hogan 
mused about what would happen if his fellow fishermen were 
transported to manhattan they would really think theyre on 
another planet 
hogan and cornell raised the 56 million to finance the movie 
it became australias biggest grosser and paramount bought the 
us rights and 20th century fox the rest of the world 
before the american opening hogan suffered a cerebral 
hemorrhage while weightlifting he quickly recovered and has had no 
recurrence it was just one of those things that come along to 
remind you that youre not superman he said 
paul and noelene hogan who married in 1958 divorced in 1981 
and remarried a year later have five children and have become 
grandparents he was asked if he receives more respect at home 
since crocodile dundee 
im still the head of the house by sufferance he replied 
i dont get any special privilege i still cant turn off the 
television set and sit in front of everybody and tell them about my 
day aw shut up dad they say its boring get out of the 
way

the first time louise adams entered a houston hospital for a 
kidney transplant the donated organ ended up being sent halfway 
across the country 
a week later it happened again the kidney her ticket to a 
dialysisfree life was shipped a thousand miles away at the last 
minute 
im sure the person who got it is very deserving but its 
still very disappointing said the 57yearold houston woman 
you find yourself feeling guilty about your feelings because i 
thought well i wouldnt feel quite so badly if it had stayed in 
houston but to ship it out 
she knew she was competing not only with local patients but also 
with those waiting and praying just like her around the country 
one of those waiting and praying was denise warren 27 of 
jordan minn who got the second kidney thanks to new national 
guidelines designed to make transplantation more efficient and 
equitable 
im just happy it happened ms warren said i was 
prepared to be on dialysis for a while i didnt think id get one 
for a long time 
because of an unsuccessful kidney transplant march 16 1986 two 
years to the day before her latest operation denise warrens 
immune system had built up an unusually large number of antibodies 
her best hope was a perfectly matched kidney a rare and therefore 
prized possession 
when such an organ became available in houston in midmarch the 
gulf coast independent organ procurement organization was forced to 
relinquish it under the new rules after a computerized search by 
the united network for organ sharing ms warren was found to be 
the best candidate 
and louise adams was sent home once more to wait her wait 
ended may 20 when she received a new kidney at hermann hospital in 
houston 
thats the way it goes under the 8monthold program which 
requires americas 201 kidney transplant centers and 120 organ 
procurement agencies to share all sixantigen kidneys 
antigens simply are features of alien organisms or tissue that 
can provoke an attack by the immune system if antigens of a 
transplanted organ match those of the recipients body the immune 
system usually does not attack the sixantigen organs only 26 
percent of all donated kidneys had been snapped up where they were 
procured until the new rules were implemented 
the nurses and doctors say its a fair system said ms 
adams of course i can only believe what they tell me 
the kidneysharing policy was adopted last summer by the 
31member board of directors of unos and implemented oct 1 
the virginiabased computer center operates the organ 
procurement transplantation network to which all transplant 
centers must belong to receive medicare reimbursements the network 
was recommended by the national task force on organ 
transplantation formed under the 1984 national transplant act 
unos also instituted a standardized scoring system for 
distributing other increasingly scarce organs like hearts livers 
and lungs patients are awarded points based on medical urgency 
length of time on the waiting list and proximity to the donor 
among other things 
its a great improvement over what existed before which was a 
mishmash of politics and oldboy networks said arthur caplan 
director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of 
minnesota 
more than 13550 people are awaiting organ transplants in the 
united states 12200 of whom need new kidneys according to arthur 
harrell of the american council on transplantation virtually all 
of the kidney transplant candidates are on dialysis the 
exhausting weekafterweek mechanical elimination of impurities 
from the blood 
to increase the number of nationally shared kidneys and help 
more hardtomatch sensitized patients like ms warren the 
network in march expanded the guidelines to cover certain kidneys 
with fewer than six identified or detected antigens failure to 
comply with any of the guidelines could result in suspension or 
expulsion from the network and loss of medicare funding 
gene pierce executive director of unos expects the change to 
double the number of perfectly matched kidneys unos offers there 
were 115 organ donors reported to unos from oct 1 1987 to april 
30 who matched a potential kidney recipient for all six antigens 
not all were transplanted for various reasons 
whether its sharing kidneys or assigning points the transplant 
surgeon still has the final say according to dr john mcdonald 
president of unos and of the american society of transplant 
surgeons the physician has the option of using his best medical 
judgment now he has to defend that 
the guidelines have not changed what they centers have been 
doing in terms of getting the right organ to the right patient 
because they were doing that anyway he said but it has 
reduced that process to a written policy which they are able to 
follow and defend and argue about 
reaction has been mixed and mcdonald said one cannot have a 
national organization of this type with everybody being perfectly 
happy about it there is no organized group out there that is in 
opposition no rebellion is going on no centers have refused to 
participate and abide by these guidelines 
mandatory kidney sharing has produced the most grumbling 
some experts maintain that the longterm success of kidney 
transplants depends on careful matching of the donor and recipient 
others argue that does not justify flying kidneys all over the 
country since the more they are moved and the longer they go 
unused the less viable they become 
donated kidneys can be preserved outside the body for up to 48 
hours four times longer than livers and nearly 10 times longer 
than hearts 
obviously some people are a little upset when they have to 
send them out they could have used them locally just as well 
pierce said we keep trying to remind them that when you give 
you get back if everyone is cooperating and they must then there 
will be a fair distribution 
brian broznick executive director of the pittsburgh transplant 
foundation winces every time he sends a cadillac kidney out of 
town i do this job because i want to see people transplanted 
period but im a pittsburgher im very proud of the program here 
i want to see this program work i dont want to see my kidneys go 
to waste or share them with everybody 
mary jane lacombe transplant coordinator for the hennepin 
county medical center in minneapolis is ahead of the game as of 
early may she had given up one prized kidney but got back three 
one of which went to ms warren 
broznick had shipped out two perfect kidneys but got only one 
back 
in houston four went out but none came in we provided four 
people with kidneys and a chance they might not have otherwise 
had said rebecca davis executive director of gulf coast on 
the other hand it just so happens that twice the same patient ms 
adams was asked to come in for the potential transplant and twice 
told im sorry we have to ship these kidneys out 
its a very difficult very touchy issue but if you look in 
the global viewpoint were probably doing what is correct

here at a glance are the law governing organ transplant the 
task force that grew out of it and the network under contract to 
help implement it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the national organ transplant act was passed by congress in 1984 
in response to the growing need for a national transplant system 
and medical and ethical guidelines it called for formation of a 
national task force on organ transplantation and mandated 
establishment of a national organ procurement and transplantation 
network to be administered by a private group with oversight of the 
us department of health and human services it provided grants to 
organ procurement groups to help increase their effectiveness and 
promote organ donation it also called for establishment of a 
registry of recipients 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the national task force on organ transplantation is a 25member 
panel that made 70 recommendations to congress and to the secretary 
of health and human services in 1986 the panel of doctors and 
experts which no longer exists recommended 
that hearts and livers go to americans whenever possible and 
that foreigners make up no more than 10 percent of the total kidney 
recipients at any transplant center 
a ban on the exportation of donor organs except when no 
appropriate recipients can be found in the united states 
that all states pass laws under which hospitals would be 
required to approach families about the possibility of organ

beach days still turn to deluge with no regard for 
forecasters promises but the tricky art of predicting the weather 
is actually getting better 
how much better so accurate according to one official that 
people are starting to believe them 
its my impression that there is much more reliance on weather 
forecasts today says h robert glahn people will use them 
whereas 20 years ago they probably wouldnt 
there are many statistical ways of interpreting forecasters 
track records says glahn chief of the national weather services 
technologies development laboratory in silver spring md but in 
general studies show that a 48hour forecast now is almost as 
accurate as a 24hour forecast was 20 years ago 
according to the weather services way of keeping time a 
24hour forecast is this mornings prediction of what it will do 
this afternoon a 48hour forecast is todays prediction of what 
will happen tomorrow 
another example of the improvement says glahn is forecasters 
growing avoidance of big errors last winter there was a 6 percent 
chance the weather service would be off 10 degrees or more on 
tomorrows temperature twenty years ago there was a 13 percent 
chance 
other ways of looking at forecasters prowess produce numbers 
that arent quite so impressive 
frederick sanders a meteorologist who retired four years ago 
from the massachusetts institute of technology notes that it isnenough 
to be right most of the time anybody can do that 
in boston for example it rains one day in three so a daily 
forecast of no rain will be right 67 percent of the time in 
yuma ariz it rains just seven days a year making the same 
forecast right 98 percent of the time 
so sanders and others who keep track of such things compare the 
forecast to the average weather whats known as the climatological 
norm 
in boston forecasters give the correct nextday forecast about 
82 percent of the time halfway between 67 percent which requires 
no skill and 100 percent so the forecasters are said to have a 50 
percent skill level 
from 1966 until he retired sanders and his students predicted 
the boston weather every day their accuracy was a little better 
than the weather service and over time he found that their skill 
improved about 5 percent a decade 
a similar analysis by allan h murphy at oregon state university 
found that the weather service is improving 510 percent a decade 
forecasters attribute most of the improvement to computers 
which let them create threedimensional pictures of the atmosphere 
using complex formulas they fastforward the weather to create an 
image of the winds pressures temperatures and moisture in 
tomorrows skies 
i think the improvement in the future will be a little greater 
than it has been says tzvi galchen of the university of 
oklahoma im not willing to bet my house on it but maybe my 
car i have a very old car 
sanders foresees no breakthroughs in forecasting precision but 
he quickly adds that his prediction probably doesnt mean much 
big breakthroughs are always unexpected he says thats 
one of the interesting things about fishing and science

dr allen steere is making his spring rounds 
spreading the word that tourists wearing shorts and sandals are 
easy prey for ticks carrying the disease he identified 
steere speaks about lyme disease not only as the doctor who 
first classified the infection 13 years ago but also as a parent 
whose son caught it despite his fathers expertise and caution 
as this disease spreads into areas where it has not been 
before it becomes even a more difficult problem to deal with 
said steere director of the lyme disease clinic at the new england 
medical center 
he was working at yale university when he discovered the disease 
and named it for lyme conn where he identified it in a group of 
children cases have been confirmed in 33 states europe asia 
australia and new zealand 
to detail the rapid spread of the disease steere tells of his 
son who caught lyme disease in 1983 despite daily tick checks 
they lived then in north branford conn 30 miles from lyme 
when i first arrived in connecticut it was only in the 
southeast corner of the state he said in a telephone interview 
from marthas vineyard where he was briefing local health 
officials just during the time i was there we saw the tick 
spread into our community and it hasnt stopped 
the disease is transmitted by the bite of a pinheadsized deer 
tick but the real culprit is borrelia burgdorferi a spiralshaped 
bacteria populations of infected ticks have been found along the 
northeast coast from maine to maryland and in wisconsin 
minnesota oregon and california 
early signs of lyme disease include flulike symptoms and a 
circular rash that expands from the bite patients given 
antibiotics early generally are cured without lasting effects if 
untreated 60 percent of patients develop arthritislike symptoms 
other possible complications include hepatitis respiratory 
distress and damage to the heart and central nervous system 
fifteenhundred cases are reported in the united states each 
year but steere and dr andrew spielman of the harvard school of 
public health said many go unreported because victims believe they 
have other ailments 
some scientists predict an increase in the number of cases this 
year because of a growing deer population and an accompanying rise 
in the number of deer ticks 
the majority of tick bites occur from midmay through july and 
most victims report having been in or near a woods with a deer 
population although the ticks that carry the ailment live on deer 
in their adult stages lyme disease is transmitted by bites from 
immature ticks which feed primarily on mice 
the immature ticks bite humans at mousebelly height 
placing people with exposed feet and legs at highest risk spielman 
said that means a good thing to do when in an area of high risk 
is to wear lightcolored trousers and tuck the cuffs into your 
stockings you need to check your pants frequently and carefully 
because the ticks are very small about the size of a poppy seed 
those bitten are unlikely to contract the disease if the tick is 
removed with tweezers within 24 hours of the bite 
a boston company spielman is associated with ecohealth is 
marketing damminix small tubes filled with cotton treated with 
a chemical that kills the ticks mice carry the cotton to their 
nests where the immature ticks live the chemical is available in 
a clothing spray but doesnt have federal approval and is licensed 
in only a few states spielman said

the first time louise adams entered a houston hospital for a 
kidney transplant the donated organ ended up being sent halfway 
across the country a week later it happened again 
ms adams 57 knew that under new national guidelines designed 
to make transplantation more efficient and equitable she was 
competing not only with local patients but also with many of the 
more than 12200 people awaiting kidney transplants in the united 
states 
when a perfectly matched kidney only 26 percent of all 
donated kidneys became available in houston in midmarch the gulf 
coast independent organ procurement organization had to relinquish 
it under the new rules a computer search by the united network for 
organ sharing found that instead of ms adams the best candidate 
was denise warren 27 of jordan minn 
the kidneysharing policy was adopted last summer by unos and 
implemented oct 1 unos operates the organ procurement 
transplantation network to which all transplant centers must 
belong to get medicare reimbursements the network was recommended 
by a national task force on organ transplantation formed under the 
1984 national transplant act 
unos also instituted a standardized scoring system for 
distributing other increasingly scarce organs like hearts livers 
and lungs patients get points based on urgency time waiting and 
proximity to the donor among other things 
reaction has been mixed and dr john mcdonald president of 
unos and of the american society of transplant surgeons said 
one cannot have a national organization of this type with 
everybody being perfectly happy about it 
there is no organized group out there that is in opposition 
no rebellion is going on

a new drug appears to reduce the number of blood 
platelets in people who have potentially hazardous high levels of 
the clotforming cells 
too many platelets a relatively rare condition known is 
thrombocytosis can lead to unwanted blood clots that cause heart 
attacks and strokes like too few platelets too many can also 
cause excessive bleeding thrombocytosis may also result from other 
diseases such as leukemia 
the drug anagrelide returned platelet levels to normal in 20 
patients without harming other kinds of blood cells 
a report on the research directed by dr murray n silverstein 
of the mayo clinic was published in a recent new england journal 
of medicine in their report the doctors concluded the new drug 
appears promising 
in an accompanying editorial however dr john w adamson of

a trio of astronomers is studying dwarf 
galaxies darker than the night sky in hopes of explaining why 
researchers have been able to see less than 10 percent of the 
universe through telescopes 
astronomers believe the mass is there because of its 
gravitational influence and the motion of star systems and explain 
it with theories that include subatomic particles called neutrinos 
and brown dwarfs larger than planets but too small to shine like 
stars 
christopher impey of the university of arizona favors a 
dimgalaxy theory 
dwarf galaxies are dim because their stars are much farther 
apart than stars in the milky way impey says in the newly charted 
virgo galaxies stars are 50 to 100 times farther apart than in our 
own yet they contain a billion stars or more while their total 
light output is substantial the starlight is distributed so 
diffusely that no part of the galaxy is brighter than the sky 
impey david malin of the angloaustralian observatory at siding 
spring australia and greg bothun at the university of michigan 
have found only the brightest faint dwarfs but even so theyve 
found at least 100 times as many faintdwarf galaxies as brighter 
ones in virgo impey said 
in the research malin searches with the 48inch wideview 
united kingdom schmidt telescope at siding spring impey uses the 
larger optical telescopes of arizonas steward observatory to study 
the properties of the galaxy and finally bothun looks with a radio 
telescope their findings will be published in july in the 
astrophysical journal

scientists are sweeping the sea floor from 
chesapeake bay to cape hatteras to find out whether millions of 
pounds of potentially harmful metal particles from coastal power 
plants are getting into the food we eat 
the question is where do they go says leonard pietrafesa 
a north carolina state university oceanographer are they lying 
dormant somewhere or are they being eaten by critters higher and 
higher up in the food chain 
in a fouryear 4 million federal study begun in february 
pietrafesa and scientists at yale columbia the university of 
south florida old dominion and brookhaven national laboratory are 
collecting sediment plants fish and other samples 
they hope to learn if heavy metals from 20 nuclear and 40 
fossilfuel power plants in new york new jersey and delaware cling 
to microscopic sea life on the shelf extending 60 miles from shore 
where most east coast seafood is caught says pierre biscaye a 
columbia university marine geochemist 
the plants annually release 20 million pounds of metals such as 
mercury lead copper and cadmium that can harm humans in large 
doses says pietrafesa if the study proves that powerplant 
byproducts remain on the shelf floor the government may propose 
stiffer regulations says helen mccammon director of the does 
ecological research division if the nation is dumping in the 
ocean we want to know whats happening to them 
are energy problems going to come back to haunt us

sept 21 the red planet will rival jupiter as the brightest object 
in the sky after the moon and venus 
it wont be this close again until 2003 says jack

and executive director of miamis space transit planetarium and 
there are a lot of kids out there who have never seen it this 
bright 
unlike halley and kohoutek marss brightness is more 
predictable and it will be visible from almost everywhere in the 
world i see 1988 as a great martian adventure says 
horkheimer im like a kid in a candy store 
earth passes mars every two years but only every 15 to 17 years 
do they come this close the year began with earth and mars 200 
million miles apart 
the unblinking reddishorange light is expected to spark ufo 
sightings horkheimer says and as if to show the heavens have a 
sense of humor the peak of the show is weeks shy of the 50th 
anniversary of orson welles war of the worlds broadcast that

in winning an agreement to acquire lucky stores 
inc american stores co is gaining a supermarket company given 
high marks for its management and marketing ability 
lucky the nations sixthlargest supermarket chain has agreed 
to be acquired by american the thirdlargest in a buyout valued 
at about 25 billion cash or 65 a share 
the merger would create the nations biggest grocery store chain 
the agreement announced friday terminated luckys april 28 deal 
to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the new york firm 
gibbons green van amerongen ltd for 235 billion in cash and 
stock 
it also gives american stores based in salt lake city a chance 
to take advantage of the management expertise and longstanding 
identity as a lowprice leader that analysts say have been among 
luckys most valuable assets 
american stores has always considered lucky to be the leading 
supermarket chain in california and is enthusiastic about the 
combination of our alpha beta grocery store operations with those 
of lucky american stores chairman ls skaggs said in announcing 
the buyout 
analysts widely had speculated that if american stores succeeded 
in acquiring dublin califbased lucky it would merge the company 
with its weaker alpha beta chain in california 
lucky stores has 480 stores and had 64 billion in 1987 sales 
american stores has 1600 stores and 141 billion in sales 
lucky also was seen as a desirable takeover target because of a 
restructuring prompted by an unsuccessful takeover attempt last 
year by new york investor asher b edelman 
the company sold off its nongrocery divisions plus stores in 
arizona and florida under the restructuring and paid 28 million 
of edelmans legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile bid 
while the 65 a share price being paid for lucky was considered 
high by some analysts american stores might justify the cost 
through the efficiencies of combined operations industry experts 
said 
to break off its buyout agreement with gibbons green lucky 
stores agreed to pay the firm a 20 million fee plus expenses 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange lucky 
closed unchanged at 6437 friday while american stores fell 1 to 
5325 
the offer from american stores is subject to a majority of 
luckys 386 million shares being tendered american stores said it 
had written commitments from commercial banks for all financing 
required 
the american stores offer expires at midnight edt june 1 
lucky shares not purchased by american stores in the tender 
offer will be converted into the right to receive 65 in cash in a 
subsequent merger between lucky and a subsidiary of american 
american stores had raised its bid for lucky to 65 a share last 
tuesday 
gibbons greens latest offer was for a leveraged buyout that 
would pay 61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of luckys 
outstanding shares gibbons green would also have issued preferred 
shares valued at 7 a share for the remaining shares 
american stores second bid followed the disclosure of 
confidential information by lucky to american under the 
stipulation that american would either sweeten its offer or end its 
hostile bid 
american stores initiated the bidding with a 45ashare tender 
offer that lucky rejected as inadeauate in march as it did a later 
offer of a negotiated acquisition at 50 a share

the government says it will extend for three 
more months a freeze on wages and the prices of federally regulated 
goods and services as part of its battle against inflation 
president miguel de la madrid decided to hold wages prices and 
the pesodollar exchange rate steady until the end of august the 
government news agency notimex reported sunday 
we will not be able to sing victory in the fight against 
inflation until the rate gets to comparable levels with the 
trading partners of our country and stays at that rate for 
several months the news agency quoted de la madrid as saying 
de la madrid unveiled the program called the economic 
solidarity pact in december in an effort to bring under control 
the nations skyrocketing inflation rate consumer prices soared a 
record 1592 percent in all of last year 
when the program was announced government officials said its 
goal was to reduce the monthly inflation rate to 2 percent to 3 
percent by years end 
but the government reported earlier this month that consumer 
prices rose 31 percent in april well under the record 155 
percent posted in january 
budget secretary pedro aspe said last week that mays inflation 
pace may run about 2 percent 
the economic program as initially drafted called for the 
monthly indexing of wages and prices but administration officials 
quickly turned the plan into a quasishock program featuring the 
wage and price freezes 
prices on governmentcontrolled goods and services such as 
tortillas subway fares and gasoline have been frozen since march 
the exchange rate for the peso currency also has held steady 
since then trading at about 2260 pesos to the us dollar 
by extending the wageprice freeze through the summer the 
government appears to have guaranteed that inflation will be low 
for the crucial july 6 presidential elections

if they want their jobs back a federal judge ruled 
perillo pontiac in chicago violated the civil rights act when it 
fired walter gilyard and marion l jones in 1986 judge prentice 
marshall said 
marshall ordered full back pay for the men who are black and 
ordered perillo to rehire them if they want their jobs back 
gilyard 48 and jones 60 said they were among four blacks on 
a 10member sales staff when new management took over the 
dealership in 1986 within 60 days no blacks were employed at the 
company the two men claimed 
in ruling on friday marshall said dennis kreeger newcar sales 
manager at perillo manifested the agonies of the damned as he 
tried to defend the firings when he testified 
we should have had a videotape of mr kreeger the judge 
said he trembled licked his lips telling a phony story for 
perillo pontiac 
kreeger and anthony scala perillos general manager argued 
that they fired gilyard because of absences and insubordination and 
fired jones because he was rude to customers and used ethnic slurs 
marshall said the allegations of rudeness were absolute 
falsehoods noting that the customer who allegedly overheard the 
slur has amazingly never been found

japans top envoy to washington on monday urged the 
japanese government to open up its market to foreign traders and 
said reassuringly that us leaders were not seeking to destroy the 
protected beef and citrus fruit markets 
japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga in tokyo for briefings 
said a breakthrough was inevitable in stalled usjapan talks over 
liberalizing japanese beef and citrus fruit markets 
discussions on us access to japans beef and citrus markets 
are under way at present and i think that an agreement will be 
reached soon matsunaga told reporters at the japan national 
press center 
the ambassador a key negotiator in negotiations to replace the 
beef and orange agreement that expired in march said the time was 
at hand for japan which has benefited from the us free trade 
system to open its markets 
after talks to settle the beef and orange dispute broke down in 
april washington on may 4 brought the issue before the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade a genevabased forum for 
international trade disputes 
washington has flatly rejected a japanese concession plan that 
would counterbalance a marketopening timetable with new surcharges 
on us beef imports aimed at bringing up prices up to domestic 
beef levels 
matsunaga discounted criticism in japan that an open farm market 
would destroy the domestic producers 
i feel that the us government is not ignoring the plight 
of domestic growers said matsunaga who took up his washington 
post three years ago 
japanese farmers cultivate uneconomical plots averaging only 25 
acres in size combined with high prices for feed and fertilizers 
domestically produced fruit and beef are among the highest priced 
in the world

the supreme court today refused to unravel a 
merger between units of eastman kodak co and fuqua industries inc 
that created the nations largest wholesale photofinishing 
operation 
the court without comment rejected a competitors arguments 
that the deal violates antitrust laws 
the competitor phototron corp of san bernardino calif 
sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust 
lawsuit seeking 300 million in damages 
a federal judge in fort worth texas temporarily blocked the 
merger but the 5th us circuit court of appeals in march 
overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while 
phototron pursues its suit 
the appeals court said phototron failed to demonstrate a 
substantial likelihood of having suffered an antitrust injury 
relying on a 1986 supreme court ruling the appeals court said 
to obtain a preliminary injunction competitors must now supply 
evidence of predatory behavior demonstrating a substantial 
likelihood that the plaintiff will be injured 
phototron said the appeals court misinterpreted the supreme 
court ruling and made it impossible to block damaging mergers that 
create monopolies 
kodak has been given a stranglehold on competing 
photofinishers phototron said 
the supreme court ruled in 1986 in a meatpacking industry 
case that a company seeking to block a merger must show a threat 
of antitrust injury and a showing of loss or damage due merely 
to increased competition does not constitute such injury 
kodak and the atlantabased fuqua industries merged to create 
qualex inc combining the fuqua subsidiary colorcraft corp with 
kodakowned laboratories the new corporation has 94 processing 
labs nationwide with sales estimated at around 300 million a year 
phototron with labs in the south and west said it already was 
being squeezed by kodaks socalled colorwatch marketing 
program phototron charged that colorwatch allows kodak to control 
supply and demand by requiring participating retail stores to send 
film for processing only to wholesale photofinishers that use kodak 
photographic paper and chemicals exclusively 
as a result phototron said its annual sales have dropped from 
40 million to 22 million because it has lost the accounts of 
major retailers 
phototron said the kodakfuqua merger will help drive 
competitors out of business by predatory pricing and other 
monopolistic practices 
businesses engage in predatory pricing by undercutting the 
prices of competitors in hopes of forcing them to lose money then 
when the competitors fold the merged company raises prices 
but the 5th circuit court said phototron failed to demonstrate 
that kodak is engaging in such predatory pricing 
the case is phototron vs kodak 871634

prime minister noboru takeshita received a draft 
fiveyear economic plan monday that pinpoints boosting domestic 
demand as the solution to most of japans foreign and domestic 
economic problems 
the plan will be debated in takeshitas cabinet in coming weeks 
and its broad outlines are expected to be confirmed as the 
directions of japans economy through 1992 
it calls for a wide range of measures to open and deregulate 
japans markets to foreign competition improved quality of life 
for the 122 million japanese and greater japanese aid to poor 
countries 
in effect it confirms the shift of the japanese economy in the 
last few years away from exports and toward heightened domestic 
demand under heavy pressure from trading partners such as the 
united states and western europe japan has swung toward domestic 
consumption as as a way to keep the economy growing and also 
respond to foreign complaints about the countrys huge trade 
surplus 
takeshita asked the economic council a task force reporting to 
the prime minister to form a fiveyear plan last november after he 
succeeded yasuhiro nakasone for six months 123 prominent japanese 
held more than 70 meetings to draft the plan which has the 
provisional name economic management within the global context 
it says japans main problems are how to reduce its trade 
surplus which goverment figures showed at 76 billion last year 
down from 897 billion in 1986 how to improve the quality of life 
in japan and how to promote balanced economic and social 
development within japan 
the three problems can all be resolved by promoting and 
consolidating the shift to a domesticdemandled economy it said 
the plan does not set a target for reduced trade surpluses but 
says they should reach internationally harmonious levels during 
the period of the plan 
the yen has doubled in value against the us dollar in the past 
three years making japanese goods more costly and difficult to 
sell abroad and increasing sales of foreign goods in japan 
the trend should be promoted the plan said by measures to make 
japan a land of business opportunity for the world at large it 
stressed such areas as tariffs import restrictions standards and 
certification requirements as needing liberalization 
the plan said ensuring better housing is the biggest issue 
facing japan on the domestic front working people in the tokyo 
area should be able to secure quality housing at commutable 
distances and reasonably priced in terms of income 
the strength of the yen has propelled japan to great national 
wealth but the japanese complain that their small houses and 
commutes of over an hour on jammed subways lead to a poor quality 
of life and that consumer prices are high by international 
standards 
the plan predicts that inflation will be kept to 15 percent 
annually and says the heavily managed pricing structures should be 
changed to narrow the gap between japanese and international prices 
taking up one of takeshitas favorite themes the plan calls for 
measures to escape the overdependence on the tokyo area and to 
revitalize nontokyo economies 
metropolitan tokyo with 12 million people is the hub of 
government and business activity the plan says some government 
offices should relocate outside tokyo and there should be major 
investment in rapidtransit systems to encourage dispersal of the 
population business and industry into other centers 
overall the plan predicts 375 percent economic growth annually 
during the fiveyear period of that domestic demand would provide 
425 percent growth and foreign demand would drop by 05 percent 
annually it predicts 
japans postworld war ii economic surge was largely based on 
exports and the chairman of the economic council gaishi hiraiwa 
said he expected vigorous debate on the plans emphasis on domestic 
demand 
attaining the goals will mean pain and burden to the people at 
large hiraiwa chairman of tokyo electric power co told 
reporters at a briefing therefore i believe that the 
understanding and cooperation of the japanese people are needed 
more than ever 
the plan also calls for tax reforms the government is moving 
steadily toward reducing income taxes and introducing taxes on 
consumption like sales taxes or europeanstyle valueadded taxes 
takeshita has said he will introduce new tax legislation this 
summer

chinese first came to canada as cooks and 
launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago today theyre flying in 
from hong kong with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and 
real estate 
for the large majority canada is a hedge against hong kongs 
reversion to chinese communist sovereignty in 1997 
while hong kong entrepreneurs find easy entry under canadas 
investor immigrant program hospitals in toronto and vancouver 
in british columbia report an increase in the number of hong kong 
women who come to have babies because the infants automatically 
become canadian citizens 
other chinese come as students and professionals 
but the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome 
they have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars 4 
million for a house because in hong kong it would be 20 million 
16 million said premier david peterson of ontario 
one recent buyer was stanley ho whose casino and ferry empire 
in hong kong and macao makes him one of asias richest men he paid 
55 million canadian dollars 44 million for a 25room mansion 
on bridle path torontos millionaires row 
across the country in vancouver li kashing whose companies 
represent 20 percent of the hong kong stock exchange won the 
bidding in april for the right to develop the choice 210acre site 
of expo 86 
through his 25yearold son victor a canadian citizen li 
plans to spend 16 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into 
pacific place a highrise complex that will consist of a 
24hour global financial center a 400room hotel manmade islands 
with 10000 housing units and a 630berth marina 
li and his son also control 52 percent of husky oil ltd 
canadas 12th largest oil company and his hong kong and shanghai 
banking corp bought the ailing bank of british columbia this past 
november 
officials estimate the current flow of chinese investment at 
16 billion a year half of it in real estate hong kong chinese 
own onethird of the shopping malls in the toronto suburb of 
scarborough one of three metropolitan chinatowns 
edward hou a canadianchinese community leader said his real 
estate company deals with 100 hong kong investors a month 
after the first chinese came for the gold rush and later to work 
on the construction of the canadian pacific railway canada 
discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of 50 a head on 
new arrivals those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947 
today 600000 canadians are of chinese descent including more 
than 200000 in toronto and 175000 in vancouver 
at any one time 18000 hong kong students are enrolled at 
canadian universities 
hong kong has become the leading source of immigrants to canada 
with 22100 visas issued last year 
i came in 1967 said david lam a 65yearold vancouver real 
estate magnate who has donated more than 5 million to british 
columbia universities and the sun yatsen classical chinese garden 
in vancouver a replica of the ancient gardens of suzhou 
lam pulled off the biggest real estate deal in vancouvers 
history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for 
other hong kong investors 
now were seeing more than just flight capital lam said in 
an interview theres a second strata of people young 
professionals who see the writing on the wall for hong kong and are 
afraid 
the chinese communists have agreed to allow hong kong to 
maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of 
sovereignty but many hong kong chinese are hedging against that 
canada is seen as desirable because of its political stability 
and large chinese population said andrea eng a vancouver 
realtor 
canadas investor immigrant program offers a visa in 
exchange for investment of 150000 canadian dollars 121500 to 
500000 dollars 405000 in approved businesses 
government figures show hong kong investment under the program 
totaled 776 million canadian dollars 628 million last year and 
created 4500 jobs 
premier peterson of ontario said he welcomes the wellheeled 
arrivals 
canada has been built by foreign capital over 50 percent of

grain and soybean futures closed sharply lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade following a weekend of 
unexpectedly wet weather in the midwest 
soybean futures took the hardest hit with most contracts off at 
least 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell prices had skyrocketed 
in the previous two weeks due to extremely dry weather during the 
planting season 
some spots in the western corn belt received more than three 
inches of rain over the weekend 
we got some rains and that pretty much did it said joel 
karlin an analyst in chicago with research department inc the 
technical indicators were grossly overbought and we had a lot of 
liquidation right from the start 
karlin said many traders decided to take profits ahead of the 
afternoon release of the national weather services sixto10day 
forecast but the markets sentiment remained extremely 
positive he said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 343 a bushel corn was 5 cents 
to 7 cents lower with july at 215 a bushel oats were 3 cents

japans nikon inc knocked perkinelmer corp 
from its traditional top spot to become the worlds no1 seller of 
equipment for semiconductor manufacturing last year according to a 
survey released monday 
it was the first time a japanese company headed the list 
according to vlsi research inc a san jose califbased 
consulting firm that compiles the annual list 
nikon moved up from seventh place on the strength of a 62 
percent gain in its sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
while perkinelmers sales in the category fell 20 percent the 
consulting firm said 
perkinelmer based in norwalk conn had held the top spot in 
the world listings since 1980 one reason for its decline was the 
discontinuation of two lines of business that accounted for 5 
percent of its sales of semiconductor equipment vlsi research said 
vlsi research released the full results to the associated press 
on monday after nikon issued a statement monday saying it had been 
listed first 
the us government has given a high priority to preserving the 
health of american companies that make equipment for producing 
computer chips considering them crucial to national security 
the industry in general us and japanese alike fared somewhat 
better in 1987 than in 1986 partly because of streamlining and 
improved market conditions vlsi research said 
nikons 62 percent rise in sales was partly the result of an 11 
percent rise in the value of the japanese yen also vlsi research 
said its estimate of the companys 1986 revenue in the category 
149 million was about 12 percent low 
japanese companies revenue was converted to dollars at a rate 
of 1507 yen to the dollar in 1987 and 1684 yen to the dollar in 
1986 
here are the names of the top 10 companies in 1987 followed by 
their 1986 rankings and their 1987 revenue from semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment 
1 nikon inc japan up from 7th 242 million 
2 perkinelmer corp norwalk conn down from 1st 213

the reagan administration has decided against 
offering legislation this year to remove antitrust restrictions on 
the bell telephone companies officials said monday 
although the administration remains convinced the prohibitions 
against bell companies entering certain competitive phone 
businesses should be removed the timing of such a proposal will 
not allow it this year the officials said 
its late into the final year of this congress and they have a 
full plate said james spurlock a spokesman for the national 
telecommunications and information administration a commerce 
department agency 
white house chief of staff howard baker sent a twoparagraph 
memo to members of the cabinetlevel economic policy council saying 
that president reagan decided to stop efforts to persuade congress 
to support legislation that would either relax or remove the 
restrictions according to communicationsweek a trade publication 
which quoted unidentified sources in this weeks issue 
the memo also said the administration had not changed its 
opinion that the restrictions should be lifted the publication 
reported 
white house spokesman bj cooper declined to comment on the 
memo but said there has been a policy decision that we are not 
going to introduce legislation on that topic this year 
the commerce department has been behind the push within the 
administration to allow the bell companies to offer electronic 
information services and manufacture telecommunications equipment 
restrictions prohibiting the companies from entering those 
businesses and from offering longdistance service were imposed by 
the antitrust decree that broke up american telephone amp telegraph 
co in january 1984 
us district judge harold greene who supervises the consent 
decree that broke up atampt last year ruled the bell companies could 
transmit information services but he refused to allow them to 
generate the information itself he said the companies continue to 
control access to local phone networks which would give them an 
unfair advantage over competitors

kaisertech ltd the worlds 
fifthlargest aluminum producer said monday it had agreed to be 
acquired by maxxam group inc in a deal estimated at 725 million 
under the terms of the deal which would make kaisertech a 
subsidiary of the los angelesbased real estate developer and 
lumber giant shareholders would receive 19375 in cash for each 
share of common stock 
kaisertechs board of directors approved the deal at a special 
meeting sunday the company said 
the companys stock closed at 1787 a share on the new york 
stock exchange down 25 cents from fridays closing 
kaisertech the holding company for kaiser aluminum amp chemical 
corp has lost money in recent years but should make a profit in 
1988 one analyst said 
right now things in the aluminum industry are very 
positive youve got good pricing and got the industry running at 
100 percent capacity said sean st clair an analyst with duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago 
the export market has perked up for us producers given the 
currency swings and then the us share of domestic market has 
increased as imports have gone down st clair said 
maxxams cash bid which salomon brothers inc told kaisertech 
was fair was recommended to the board by a special committee 
appointed earlier this month to consider proposals to acquire the 
oaklandbased company said spokesman robert w irelan 
kaisertech received one other bid that proposed a leveraged 
buyout from a private investment group said irelan who declined 
to identify the other party or discuss their bid 
stockholders will vote on the proposed merger at a special 
meeting to be called soon the company said 
earlier this year maxxam bought 32 percent of kaisertechs 
stock from its chairman alan clore for about 200 million 
last month kaisertech sued clore and maxxam over a dispute over 
rights to nominate directors but the two companies have agreed to 
ask that the litigation be put on hold irelan said 
maxxam group inc which develops real estate also owns pacific 
lumber co the worlds largest producer of redwood lumber it has 
received widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting of 
oldgrowth redwoods in northern california 
kaisertech which operates plants in nine states and seven 
foreign countries reported losses in five of the past six years 
primarily because the recession of the early 1980s depressed 
aluminum prices st clair said 
but the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices which had 
dropped to 48 cents per pound rose to 106 per pound he said 
kaisertech reported a net loss of 362 million or 811 per 
share last year compared with a loss of 398 million in 1986 
revenues were about 2 billion both years 
much of that loss stemmed from the companys restructuring last 
year irelan said 
but in the first quarter of 1988 kaisertech reported net income 
of 363 million or 73 cents per share on revenues of 5283 
million for the same period of 1987 kaisertech reported a loss of 
311 million or 69 cents per share on revenues of 4942 million 
maxxam however runs the risk that it could be buying 
kaisertech at a time of peak earnings and the company could be less 
profitable because of an economic slowdown predicted next year 
stclair said 
is possible kaisertechs earnings will turn down but i dont 
expect an actual loss he said

grain and soybean futures prices plunged monday on the chicago 
board of trade following a weekend of unexpectedly wet weather in 
the midwest 
on other markets rainrelated selling sent cotton futures 
sharply lower precious metals posted strong gains energy futures 
retreated livestock and meat were mixed and stockindex futures 
were lower 
soybean futures took the hardest hit among the grains with most 
contracts off more than 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell 
prices had skyrocketed in the previous two weeks due to extremely 
dry weather during the planting season 
some spots in the western corn belt received more than three 
inches of rain of rain over the weekend 
this is obviously just a continuation of a very emotional 
market and i think a forebearer of things to come said ted 
mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
i think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but about 
final acreage as well and the market will have to sort itself 
out 
joel karlin an analyst in chicago with research department 
inc said many traders decided to take profits ahead of the 
afternoon release of the national weather services sixto10day 
forecast but the markets sentiment remained extremely 
positive he said 
the closely watched sixto10day outlook called for most of the 
united states east of the mississippi to receive belownormal 
rainfall during the first half of next week 
after the close the agriculture department reported soybean 
planting was 62 percent complete as of sunday corn planting was 95 
percent finished and cotton planting was 71 percent done 
wheat settled 2 cents to 7 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 342 a bushel corn was 5 cents to 7 cents 
lower with july at 215 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents 
lower with july at 170 a bushel soybeans were 19 cents to 21 
cents lower with july at 757 a bushel 
weekend rains also dampened the enthusiasm for cotton futures on 
the new york cotton exchange where the december contract fell 2 
cents a pound the limit allowed for daily trading 
like soybean prices cotton prices have soared in recent weeks 
as dry weather dominated the planting season 
but the upward move was largely exaggerated said ernest 
simon cotton specialist in new york with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
cotton settled 83 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 6555 
cents a pound 
surging platinum led the precious metals market which showed 
surprising strength in the face of tumbling grain and oil prices 
platinum was buoyed by overseas buying particularly from the 
middle east and japan analysts said 
in south africa a leader of the opposition political party 
urged a boycott on exports of certain strategic materials 
including platinum to the united states if congress approves 
tougher economic sanctions against south africa that action also 
supported platinum prices analysts said 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum settled 1730 to 
1790 higher with july at 58590 a troy ounce 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 410 to 
510 higher with june at 46280 a troy ounce silver was 45 
cents to 49 cents higher with may at 6738 a troy ounce

texas intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 35 cents lower

lower with june at 4691 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 24 
cent to 92 cent lower with june at 5144 cents a gallon 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in a quiet session 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle prices fell on fears of a drop in wholesale beef prices 
and ideas that cash cattle prices were nearing a seasonal peak 
said philip stanley an analyst in chicago with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc 
hog futures also were pressured by fears of lower cash prices 
frozen pork bellies finished mixed with technical factors 
supporting the nearterm contracts stanley said 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 72 cent lower with june at 
7265 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 20 cent lower 
with may at 8090 cents a pound hogs were 02 cent to 37 cent 
lower with june at 5362 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
25 cent lower to 77 cent higher with may at 5402 cents a pound

poor management practices accompanied losses 
that drove the federal land bank in jackson miss into insolvency 
last week a farm credit official said monday 
as of last friday the banks liabilities exceeded its earning 
assets by aproximately 500 million eric p thor president of 
the farm credit assistance board told the senate agriculture 
subcommittee on agricultural credit 
this means that the board of directors and management of the 
bank have lost over 300 million in the past three years he 
added 
thor said sour loans high debt costs and heavy operating costs 
had plagued the bank 
he said the jackson bank sought 410 million to 610 million in 
assistance this year but was unable to come up with a workable plan 
to get out from under 
it seems you have indicated a lot of what you might call poor 
management practices down there said sen john breaux dla 
i would say thats a fair assessment said thor whose board 
was established by congress last year to bail out the ailing farm 
credit system 
lawmakers expressed dismay that the jackson bank had been 
allowed to go downhill until it was beyond rescue they prodded 
officials to avoid any recurrence at other land banks 
we want to avoid another jackson in omaha sen tom daschle 
dsd said 
meanwhile the jackson bank reopened its doors monday to provide 
information to borrowers a key federal regulator expressed hope 
for quick action to restore loan service under supervision of a 
receiver 
we are trying very hard to work out an agreement to restore 
service with the cooperation of some of the other system 
institutions frank w naylor jr told a news conference 
naylor chairman of the farm credit administration stressed 
that the receiver rew enterprises inc of tulsa okla was not 
authorized to make loans to customers of the bank which serves 90 
local lending associations in alabama mississippi and louisiana 
thus it would be necessary to reach an agreement with other farm 
credit system banks to make loans through the receiveroperated 
billiondollar lending cooperative whose doors were closed friday 
afternoon after months of losses averaging 45 million 
such loans would be on an interim basis while the receiver winds 
down the activities of the bank naylor said 
the jackson institution is one of 12 federal land banks within 
the massive farm credit system a 50 billion nationwide network 
of borrowerowned banks and local lending associations the system 
largely unknown to city folk outside the financial industry is a 
longtime bulwark of us agriculture 
doldrums in the farm economy in the early 1980s combined with 
unfavorable credit agreements plus high overhead within the system 
brought some of the banks into hard financial straits in recent 
years that prompted congress to pass a major bailout bill last 
year 
the jackson bank received 30 million in aid under the bailout 
bill but the assistance board that makes such decisions turned off 
the tap last week and instead asked the farm credit administration 
the systems federal regulator to place the institution in 
receivership 
our responsibility will be to wind down the activities of this 
institution naylor said adding that it should take less than a 
year 
naylor was asked if the administrartions action meant there 
soon would be a rash of foreclosures 
quite the contrary he said he said those whose loans are 
not performing would get the full benefit of borrowers rights 
provisions under last years bailout legislation 
the receivers task also would involve placing the banks 
business with other lending institutions naylor said he said it 
was expected that some other system lender would move into the 
threestate area to take over the jackson business but that it was 
too early to say which one 
we would expect fairly quick action he said 
he said it would be legal for the receiver to sell assets to 
private lending institutions but he said the farm credit 
administration certainly will be reviewing all significant 
actions in the district 
nayor said there is evidence of a turnaround for many of the 
farm credit system institutions during the last year there are 
still several land banks facing serious problems but theyre 
working their way through them he added 
the jackson banks porfolio of more than 21000 loans totaled 
168 billion at years end but 40 percent of that amount was tied 
up in loans classified either as nonaccrual or highrisk 
liabilities meanwhile reached 1909 billion on march 31

western union corp on monday 
reported a 6252 million firstquarter loss most of which 
resulted from costs connected with the telecommunication companys 
reorganization 
the loss blamed on the costs of a major restructuring compared 
with a loss of 188 million in the same period a year ago 
special charges of 603 million in the first quarter resulted 
from writedowns connected with the planned unloading of the 
companys microwave and voiceswitching facilities officials said 
the writedowns reflect the companys exit from the business of 
providing communications facilities to focus on specialized 
business and consumer services 
the charges also resulted from severance and pension costs 
stemming from its previously announced plan to lay off 1800 
employees or 25 percent of the work force by the end of the year 
and from costs related to the curtailing of a management pension 
plan 
revenues were 235 million compared to 205 million for the 
previous first quarter figures in 1987 do not include revenues 
from itt corps international telex unit itt world communications 
inc was acquired in december 1987 as part of western unions 
downtothewire restructuring 
savings from the layoffs were not reflected in the 1988 figures 
president robert j amman said the facilities sales would help 
reduce the burden of fixed costs associated with the operation of a 
nationwide telecommunications plant 
the companys stock on the new york stock exchange dropped to 
3 down 125 cents on the news 
one analyst said he looked on the writedowns as expected and 
not unwelcome and usually a good sign in the telecommunications 
business 
its better to take them right off get the bad egg out and 
move ahead rather than let old wounds fester said stuart ganes 
of shearson lehman bros inc in new york

firestone incs us plants were up to 
almost full operation monday after a tentative contract agreement 
ended a weeklong strike by 4700 members of the united rubber 
workers union 
the president of the united rubber workers milan stone said 
the results of the bargaining showed the effectiveness of using the 
goodyear contract as a pattern for the firestone contract 
while some companies and some analysts have said our system 
of pattern bargaining has outlived its usefulness we feel that 
it is the most fair and reasonable way to accomplish our goals 
stone said in a written statement 
the urw meanwhile was awaiting the results of a vote by a 
local in gadsden ala on a settlement reached last week with 
goodyear tire amp rubber co union officials though announced 
sunday that enough locals had voted in favor of the contract to 
ensure its approval 
nine of 11 goodyear locals representing 10575 urw members 
approved the contract 
firestone employees returned to work at plants in six states 
late sunday the same day company and union negotiators approved a 
tentative contract firestone spokesman james strandberg said 
production was approaching normal levels on monday 
urw spokesman curt brown said the firestone pact followed a 
pattern set by the settlement reached with goodyear shortly before 
a strike deadline may 17 
brown said the unions contract with goodyear was effectively 
ratified when the 1700member local 2 in akron overwhelmingly 
approved the contract sunday no figures were released 
ratification votes on the firestone proposal are expected to be 
held this week at company offices and plants in akron noblesville 
ind des moines iowa decatur ill russellville ark and 
oklahoma city brown said 
the firestone and goodyear contracts both offer workers an 
immediate 25cent wage increase that is to be deducted from future 
costofliving increases in increments of 10 cents 10 cents and 5 
cents 
the 6500 urw members who work for uniroyal goodrich tire co 
ratified a threeyear agreement by may 16 that guarantees against 
plant closings but includes a limitation on costofliving raises 
during the first year the union said 
the urw demonstrated its concern for keeping uniroyal goodrich 
viable and we trust this will pay off in future improvements for 
these members stone said

the supreme court on monday let stand a ruling 
that put millions of socalled fixed annuities under the 
jurisdiction of federal securities laws 
under the lower court ruling fixed annuities paying fluctuating 
interest rates could be regulated the same as stocks and bonds 
insurance industry officials had opposed the rule claiming it 
imposed a heavy regulatory burden that would raise company costs 
and translate into higher prices for consumers 
in other businessrelated actions monday the high court 
agreed to study the power of states to regulate natural gas 
production including useitorloseit rules designed to 
stimulate production 
refused to unravel a merger between units of eastman kodak co 
and fuqua industries inc that created the nations largest 
wholesale photofinishing operation 
gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal 
nuclear production facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation 
the insurance industry had been watching the annuities case 
closely since it involved policies held by millions of customers 
and representing billions of dollars 
among these fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as 
insurance contracts because investors never risk their principal 
annuity holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus 
a certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals 
holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of 
return on contributions and most annuity plans provide for 
excess interest paid at the discretion of the annuity company 
in 1967 the supreme court ruled that socalled variable 
annuities those that do not assure any minimum interest payments 
on contributions may be treated as securities regulated by federal 
law 
but a ruling by the 7th us circuit court of appeals last april 
15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was also treated as a 
security 
beverly otto sued the variable annuity life insurance co 
valic in 1982 contending that the fixed annuity is a 
security and that valic had violated antifraud provisions of 
federal securities law 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that the fixed 
annuity is not a security 
but the 7th circuit court reversed that ruling reinstating the 
suit the appeals court said valics fixed annuity did not qualify 
for such treatment because its excessinterest rate on existing 
deposits could be changed at any time at valics discretion 
by refusing to hear the case the high court let that ruling 
stand 
we were hoping the supreme court would take the case said 
john adney an attorney representing the washingtonbased industry 
group national association of life companies on monday 
he noted that under the appeals court ruling fixed annuities 
contracts must be filed with the securities and exchange 
commission and be subject to their regulation not just 
regulation by state insurance departments 
that means considerable expense and complications for the 
insurance companies and for the situation of the policy 
holders he added 
while big companies can afford those added expenses he said 
the nalc feared that the increased costs could mean that smaller 
companies might not be able to shoulder the increased risk or to 
compete in the market 
in the natural gas case the high court said it would review a 
ruling upholding the power of kansas officials to control 
production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas 
reservoir in the world 
the kansas supreme court in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the 
kansas corporation commission covering gas from the hugoton field 
most of which is carried outside the state through pipelines 
since 1944 the kansas corporation commission permitted owners 
of underproducing wells to save up their authorized production 
ceilings creating what are called underages and overproduce 
in future months to make up for shortfalls 
to create a production incentive the kansas commission changed 
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within 
specified periods of years or they would be canceled 
the rule was challenged by northwest central pipeline corp one 
of the major buyers of the hugoton gas for transport outside the 
state it asked the supreme court to strike down the 1983 
regulations on grounds that the federal energy regulatory 
commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production 
in the kodakfuqua case the court rejected a competitors 
arguments that the deal violates antitrust laws 
the competitor phototron corp of san bernardino calif 
sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust 
lawsuit seeking 300 million in damages 
a federal judge in fort worth texas temporarily blocked the 
merger but the 5th us circuit court of appeals in march 
overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while 
phototron pursues its suit 
kodak and the atlantabased fuqua industries merged to create 
qualex inc combining the fuqua subsidiary colorcraft corp with 
kodakowned laboratories in a ruling on injuries the court said 
a worker injured falling from a scaffold at a federally supervised 
nuclear plant in ohio is entitled to seek a bonus compensation 
award under a state law 
the court ruled against goodyear atomic corp which operates 
the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant near piketon ohio

a federal judge monday cleared the way 
for swedens ab electrolux to pursue its 182 million hostile bid 
for murray ohio manufacturing co a maker of lawn mowers and 
bicycles 
electrolux announced immediately that it would increase its bid 
to 197 million upping the tender offer from 48 to 52 per share 
of murray ohio common stock electrolux said the tender offer would 
be subject to shareholder approval only if ab electrolux is not 
satisfied that the ohio control share act is inapplicable to the 
offer 
the ohio control share act is an antitakeover law and the 
electrolux statement said it would seek a ruling from federal 
courts in ohio that the act is inapplicable 
us district judge thomas a wiseman dissolved a temporary 
injunction against electroluxs 48ashare offer by discounting 
murray ohios allegations that a new york law firm which once 
represented the tennessee company passed confidential information 
to electrolux 
the firm sullivan amp cromwell had advised murray ohio on how to 
defend itself against takeovers before it represented electrolux in 
its tender offer 
hans g backman executive vice president of the stockholmbased 
appliance maker had testified last week that electrolux received 
no confidential information directly or indirectly from sullivan amp 
cromwell 
he said his company based its action on murray ohios annual 
stockholders report as well as other public documents 
all the information appeared in an magazine article that was 
readily available to any professional investigator wiseman 
agreed in his ruling 
electrolux also said monday it has no plans to move murray ohio 
operations from the present plant at lawrenceburg tenn

a new jersey clothing manufacturer was 
sentenced to three years in prison in the nations largest payroll 
tax evasion case authorities said monday 
jerome a finkelstein 63 could have received 35 years in 
prison for his guilty plea to charges he failed to pay income and 
social security taxes on 1 million in wages paid to illegal 
aliens mostly polish said us attorney samuel a alito jr

1982 out of a separate checking acount he operated a group of 
womens clothing companies under the umbrella name european 
tailoring group ltd of passaic 
alito said it was the largest case of payroll withholding tax 
evasion in the united states 
in court papers finkelstein said hiring the aliens helped the 
policy of the united states government at that time to aid and 
assist those who were struggling for survival of the solidarity 
labor union and otherwise seeking freedom from communist 
oppression according to alitos office 
he claimed it was unfair to make illegal aliens pay taxes to the 
government when they received nothing in return as a matter of 
law 
finkelsteins wife ethel wrote the judge saying that her 
husbands company made clothes for top designers including ralph 
lauren oscar de la renta bill blass and calvin klein according
