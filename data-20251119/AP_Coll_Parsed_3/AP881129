a helicopter flying in the persian gulf last 
summer only wanted to shoot film for nbc news but a us destroyer 
almost blew it out of the sky when the crew failed to respond to 
repeated warnings 
news helicopters around the world are becoming more aggressive in 
their quest for the best pictures pilots and officials now are 
taking steps to avoid disaster to strike a balance between the 
first amendment and public safety 
following last mays 7million redondo beach pier fire near los 
angeles news pilot bob tur was criticized for fanning smoke and 
flames endangering firefighters and hampering radio communications 
with noise 
we can be a pain acknowledged tur who is currently 
appealing a 180day license suspension for an unrelated infraction 
but he denied he hovered too close and said that wasnt the real 
reason for his problems people sometimes dont want publicity 
but if the media didnt tell you who would 
more news choppers are buzzing the skies above big news events 
from earthquakes to chemical spills often its the only way 
television crews or newspaper photographers can grab pictures of a 
distant sea rescue or landslide before deadline 
not too long ago only the three major television stations in los 
angeles and the los angeles times used helicopters said mike 
dreesman whose helitac aviation currently flies for the associated 
press and other news organizations nowadays photographers from 
such publications as the national enquirer spend hours each week 
airborne 
we ask the news helicopters to back off and most of them are 
pretty polite about it said sgt brent carey of the police air 
support division others are pretty persistent they want to keep 
taking their pictures and at times it becomes an annoyance 
these days teamwork among helicopters begins to play a more 
important role and thats not the most common trait in such a 
competitive business 
theres no problem in and around a major event when pilots 
communicate said bob pettee who flies for knbctv the only 
problem is when somebody does something unexpected 
pettee said experienced news pilots can shoot a chemical spill 
without stirring up toxic gas stay far enough away from a hostage 
situation to avoid exciting a gunman and cooperate with other 
pilots on the scene 
sometimes they even help officials by tracking fires or flying 
out victims he said 
complaints were common before the federal aviation administration 
limited flights around disasters in 1985 the faas joann sloan 
said the restrictions allow local officials to ask the faa to 
declare fires crashes and other incidents offlimits to aircraft 
for safety reasons 
news aircraft are permitted only if they file a flight plan fly 
above rescue aircraft obey onsite authorities and follow other 
rules 
los angeles fire and law enforcement officials said they 
coordinate coverage with news helicopters as they show up on the 
scene 
i think the faa thinks they have things under control said 
ms sloan we havent had any disasters occur with these news 
helicopters that i know of anytime recently 
but last december jim burnett thenchairman of the national 
transportation safety board cited helicopter problems in asking the 
faa to tighten controls around disaster sites 
burnett cited six incidents since 1974 where news helicopters 
worsened hazards or hampered rescue efforts these included stirring 
up fumes and dust around spills of hazardous materials a fatal 
crash over a chemical fire and distracting ground rescue crews 
these incidents illustrate how nonrescue aircraft can 
interfere with rescue and cleanup activities and endanger the lives 
and health of the occupants of the aircraft the victims of the 
accident and the emergency response personnel responding to the 
fire or hazardous materials incident burnett wrote 
faa administrator t allan mcartor declined to issue new rules in 
march but he pledged the faa would impose a 180day license 
suspension for pilots ignoring flight restrictions 
tur knows all about such suspensions the pilot whose company 
sells videotape to several television stations ran into trouble 
with federal officials in march 1987 over the air national guard jet 
fighter crash that killed dean paul martin son of entertainer dean 
martin 
the faa honored a request by search officials to issue flight 
restrictions around the crash site in the san bernardino mountains 
east of los angeles according to testimony at a suspension hearing 
last september 
tur was warned away from the area by an air force colonel on the 
scene but he flew by to shoot late afternoon pictures of searchers 
combing the steep brushfilled mountainside for debris and bodies 
other news crews were escorted over the scene at a higher altitude 
tur contended that flights were restricted only to avoid 
publicity 
never can a local state or federal agency prevent news media 
representatives from flying into an area because public relations 
doesnt want the story told he said 
but col charles k cross the air force officer at the site 
testified news helicopters posed a safety threat he said turs 
noisy flight significantly disrupted my coordination efforts by 
distracting searchers and jeopardized their safety 
like tur the late leo galanis of denvers kusatv who was head 
of the national broadcast pilots association felt the martin crash 
site was restricted merely to curb publicity 
i think its obvious if it was not dean martins son there 
would not have been a restriction in effect galanis said in an 
interview a few weeks before his own death in a helicopter crash 
galanis and cameraman brian hostetler were returning from 
covering a plane crash oct 19 when their helicopter became 
entangled in a utility cable and crashed southwest of denver both 
men were killed 
blocking or limiting media helicopters galanis said in the 
interview prevents the public from seeing events that theyre 
entitled to see under the first amendment

in japanese this country is called nippon or 
sometimes nihon and therein lies a seed of debate 
why is our country called japan its official name is 
nippon kazuo sato wrote in a letter published in september by the 
asahi shimbun provoking a minor flood of other readers letters 
the 26yearold student from tokyo argued that japan should 
unanimously use nippon as its own name on the international 
level on athletes uniforms when they compete abroad for instance 
one of the editors of asahis letters section thought the flurry 
of response and comment was slightly alarming a possible sign of 
nationalistic feelings at a time when emperor hirohito was gravely 
ill 
it is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue 
especially under the current situation when the emperors illness 
has been affecting the country he said asking that he not be 
named 
but the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be 
used to debate the issue 
i guess it would be easier if we could choose one name but 
we cannot decide which should be legitimate he said 
not everybody is sensitive about the countrys name or worried 
that japan is getting nationalistic 
a foreign relations specialist and conservative writer hideaki 
kase said i think its fine to have a few different names there 
seems to be no problem using either japan or nippon it has 
nothing to do with nationalism 
a foreign ministry official said there are no rules on how to 
name countries in other languages and he noted that japan is 
spelled japon in spanish and pronounced like hapon 
but what should japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for 
international competition no one but the chinese would be able to 
recognize japans name written in the chinese characters which 
japan borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago so it has to 
be written in the roman alphabet called romaji in japanese 
kayoko yamamoto a spokesman for the japan amateur sports 
association said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned 
japan for international athletic events 
for major international events we use japan as the countrys 
official name because english is the most common language she 
said 
but theres no firm rule and some teams also go with nippon 
masaaki obana of the japan volleyball association said the 
national volleyball team has both japan and nippon uniforms but 
players wear nippon more often in international contests 
either way theyre our countrys names we dont think we 
should be using only one of the two obana said 
after satos letter was published the volleyball association 
received many inquiries asking which name is official because 
japanese volleyball players wore their nippon uniforms at the summer 
olympics games in seoul south korea 
the asahi editor said the newspaper japans secondlargest 
circulation daily received about 10 letters on the issues 
karen blahitka from yamaguchi prefecture in southwestern japan 
wrote that she was against using nippon because many languages as 
well as japanese translate foreign countries names into their own 
tongue and englishspeaking countries are no exception 
for example bundesrepublik deutschland is the federal republic 
of germany or colloquially west germany in english and nishi 
doitsu in japanese she said 
teacher tatsuya akizuki 36 wrote it is a huge task to change 
the way a countrys name or persons name which has already become 
fixed in our daily lives is pronounced 
if japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and 
names of people in the languages of the respective countries we 
would be in trouble he added 
the origin of the name japan is not certain but researchers say 
it probably came from the malayan japung or the chinese 
riben meaning roughly land of the rising sun 
historians say the japanese called their country yamato in its 
early history and they began using nippon around the seventh 
century nippon and nihon are used interchangeably as the countrys 
name

a newspaper columnists beef about litterbugs 
got him into trouble on the city streets hes trying to keep clean 
a few weeks ago the philadelphia inquirers clark deleon wrote a

president chadli bendjedid promising to 
usher in a new era of liberal reforms solidified his power during a 
meeting of the nations only party and virtually assured himself of 
another five years in office 
the national liberation front wrapped up its twoday congress 
late monday night by electing a new 155member central committee 
which then designated bendjedid as its secretarygeneral 
the head of the party automatically becomes sole candidate in the 
presidential elections which the congress set for dec 22 
bendjedid thus will win a third fiveyear term as head of this 
oneparty socialist state 
but bendjedid now must confront the growing economic and social 
problems that exploded into bloody riots in early october official 
reports said 176 died in the protests but unofficial estimates put 
the death toll at 500 
i need your help because the mission is difficult the task is 
long and the problems are great bendjedid told the 5078 congress 
delegates in his closing speech 
the renewal of your confidence is a support for the political 
reform proposals of which a part already have been applied and 
others are going to be i promise to do my best to implement your 
political program 
many algerians however were hoping that the congress would 
approve a multiparty political system 
bendjedid said during the congress that such a move was possible 
in the future but he contended it could harm national unity at the 
present time 
it was not know at the end of the congress what form bendjedids 
reforms would take 
the october riots were staged by algerians upset with high 
unemployment rising prices and a shortage of housing the protests 
prompted bendjedid to promise a more liberal political system and 
less central control 
bendjedid has been trying for the past two years to institute 
reforms particularly breaking the grip of the party on the 
daytoday running of the country that effort was accelerated by 
the violence in october 
he told the congress that a package of reforms would be presented 
to parliament soon but did not detail what they would contain 
abdelhamid mehri the no 2 man in the party said that although 
a multiparty system had been rejected for the immediate future free 
candidacies for some elected offices would be allowed 
that means nonparty members may run for local assemblies and the 
national parliament 
the new central committee was comprised almost equally of 
delegates elected from local cells from government and party 
functionaries and from union and professional organizations 
that appeared to bring in the new blood bendjedid was seeking and 
end the domination of party militants that characterized the 
outgoing committee 
after the october riots the government quickly held a referendum 
to win approval of the first phase of reforms those consisted 
mainly of changes to the constitution 
among those changes was according new power to the premier and 
making him directly responsible to the parliament rather than the 
president shortly after the nov 3 referendum bendjedid appointed 
a new premier kasdi merbah and a government made up largely of 
technicians rather than professional party militants 
algerias debt is estimated at 23 billion the nation also has 
faced a dramatic fall in the price of oil the countrys main 
export during the past two years and an unemployment rate of 22 
percent

a young reserve soldier whose face was burned 
and mutilated by a firebomb went on television to ask fellow 
israelis to show some understanding and stop staring at him 
shimon navon a 25yearold university student was doing his 
required duty in the occupied west bank last june when palestinians 
hurled a firebomb at his jeep his face was disfigured and all his 
fingers had to be amputated 
he decided to appear on an israeli tv talk show monday night he 
said because his countrymen react so cruelly when they encounter 
victims like himself in public 
all the stares lock on you he said sometimes its 
helplessness or even fear people just have no tact and they 
shout things like look at this weirdo look at this creature 
as though we are not living in a country where people should 
know about this phenomenom it happens a lot and im not the only 
one there are a lot like me 
navons entire face is covered with burns and scar tissue his 
ears were burned off his fingerless hands are still wrapped in 
bandages 
he appeared on tv with his girlfriend miri amiel they began 
dating about six months before he was hurt and ms amiel said they 
were closer now than ever 
before we were like any couple going out together studying 
together having fun now we have to deal with all these things 
together she said of course shimon has to deal with it more 
than i but i am a partner in everything 
they met at college where he was taking a preparatory course 
before studying for a degree 
amiel said she too is pained by the publics reaction 
its very sad for me to see all the stares and hope that 
shimon doesnt notice she said 
tragedy struck navon at 11 pm on june 14 the last day of his 
units 24day tour of duty in the occupied areas his jeep entered 
beit umar village for one last patrol before returning to base for a 
farewell party 
i didnt want to do the extra round because it was late he 
said i felt a strange feeling after a moment or two i 
felt the molotov cocktail all of me was burning i couldnt 
open the door to get out of the jeep 
since then navon has undergone more than a dozen operations and 
skin transplants 
he said he began crying when he realized what he looked like and 
my brother and my girlfriend also started crying a few 
minutes later i said ok guys calm down everything will be all 
right this isnt going to break me 
the television showed a photograph of navon and amiel taken 
before the attack and portraying a handsome young man in army 
uniform 
i was always a pretty realistic and rational type navon 
said this new situation is not simple and not easy but it 
wont help to complain or ask why i look like this 
he said he was appealing to israeli society to be kinder to burn 
victims not for himself but because other burn victims were more 
sensitive than he 
at least 10 people have suffered serious burns in firebomb 
attacks in the past year a frequent weapon in the yearlong 
palestinian uprising that has killed more than 300 palestinians and 
11 israelis 
navon said he harbors no desire for revenge and no feelings of 
hatred toward the palestinians who attacked him 
he said palestinian insurrectionists have a struggle of their 
own and the way theyre doing it with violence they wont 
accomplish anything they must sit and talk this problem out

a town meeting monday endorsed the idea of 
reducing the use of polystyrene coffee cups and other plastic food 
containers but backed down from a complete ban on the nonrecyclable 
materials 
a group called foam free amherst sponsored the proposal to ban 
the sale of plastic foam food containers in the town of 35000 
people home to amherst college and the university of massachusetts 
townspeople voted instead on a substitute motion calling on the 
town to endorse the goals of reducing the use of nonrecyclable 
plastics educate vendors and users about cutting back and 
encourage use of alternatives 
there was no discussion of the original motion at town meeting 
but thomas w hutcheson who sponsored the substitute measure said 
foam free amherst supported the replacement the motion passed by 
voice vote 
the aim of the original proposal was to discourage the use of 
plastics because they take up considerable space in the town dump 
and create gases that deplete the earths ozone layer when 
manufactured and burned according to sponsor cynthia pauley 
a spokesman for the polystyrene packaging council a trade group 
in washington dc defended the plastic by saying that researchers 
have found fastfood packaging takes up only onequarter of 1 
percent of landfills in weight and volume 
moreover betsy decampos said the polystyrene industry has 
voluntarily agreed to stop using chlorofluoromethane in the 
manufacture of plastic cups by january out of concern for the 
earths ozone layer 
amherst was one of several communities across the nation to take 
a closer look at polystyrene cups and consider bans that decampos 
called a quick fix to the solid waste issue 
bans already are in effect in berkeley calif and suffolk 
county ny in massachusetts gov michael s dukakis has issued an 
executive order effective july 1989 banning state agencies from 
purchasing plastic foam food packaging

stumped for a christmas present for the person who 
has everything how about a bridge 
the state highway department has honesttogoodness historic 
bridges available to anyone who will give them good homes and will 
haul them away 
but seriously who would want a bridge 
cities counties park and recreation districts land developers 
anyone who wants to preserve some road history and save some of 
the enormous cost of building a new trestle is interested in the 
bridges said sally pearce staff historian for the department 
bridges in the 3yearold adoptabridge program are 
scheduled for replacement because they are deteriorating or 
impractical for modern traffic 
eighteen bridges most made of steel trusses are eligible for 
the program pearce said but so far only three have reached some 
stage of being moved mainly because of the difficulties in 
relocating them 
moving expenses vary for example to disassemble and relocate 
all four 185footlong spans of the fifth street bridge in grand 
junction is estimated to cost between 360000 and 480000 for a 
single span 120000

at least one of the 100odd american 
ambassadors that presidentelect george bush must select could rank 
in importance with many of the cabinet choices now drawing most of 
the nations attention 
bush must select the successor to former senate democratic leader 
mike mansfield retiring after a record 11 years as ambassador to 
tokyo 
the job is important simply because japan has become so important 
to america in the late 20th century 
together the two countries account for 40 to 50 percent of world 
economic output they have one of the worlds most complex 
emotionallycharged and changing relationships 
mansfield calls the usjapanese relationship the most important 
in the world and says that during his tenure in tokyo it has changed 
from that of unclenephew to brotherbrother 
complicating the lovehate feelings often felt between the 
countries are deep cultural and language differences and japans new 
world importance 
in only four decades japan has transformed itself from a humble 
defeated american enemy to a us protege and loyal ally an 
economic superpower and rival us creditor landlord and 
occasional critic 
during the election campaign bush took positions on issues such 
as japans military and foreign aid role and trade 
to demands that japan increase military spending and relieve some 
of the us defense burden bush a bomber pilot against japan in 
world war ii noted that japans asian neighbors still remember the 
war and remain very sensitive to the issue of japanese 
rearmament 
he suggested that japan rapidly boost its share of global 
economic aid a category in which it is about to surpass the united 
states but that too could create other conflicts because japan 
is already becoming a rival to us dominance of such international 
institutions as the world bank 
on trade bush is expected to take president reagans general 
line of seeking to brake protectionist efforts to restrict japanese 
imports into the united states while encouraging sharpened us 
competitiveness 
reagan and yasuhiro nakasone the japanese prime minister from 
198287 developed a firstname relationship unprecedented in the 
two countries history their personal connection helped the nations 
weather a rough period marked by us pressure against japanese 
domestic barriers alleged unfair trade practices and insular 
thinking inappropriate for a country grown rich by exporting 
noboru takeshita nakasones successor said during a white house 
visit that he also had gotten on a firstname basis with the us 
president tokyo news reports say he hopes to visit washington early 
in the bush presidency to cultivate the same kind of relations 
after 14 years as senate democratic leader mansfield was sent to 
japan by democratic president jimmy carter in 1981 reagan asked him 
to stay in the increasingly important post 
announcing his retirement mansfield said he felt he could leave 
with our heads high the us trade deficit with japan 
accounting for 57 billion of a global deficit of 170 billion in 
1987 is finally narrowing he said as a result of hardbargained 
marketopenings the costlier yen and cheaper dollar and efforts by 
nakasone and takeshita to boost japanese domestic consumption and 
imports 
but new flareups can be expected between two countries that have 
such different backgrounds but are now so economically 
interdependent 
pressure from the democraticcontrolled congress for all us 
allies to shoulder more defense costs promises to affect 
usjapanese relations members ask why the united states with all 
its deficit problems should spend 6 percent of gross national 
product on defense while japan devotes just 1 percent of its wealth 
to the same purpose 
but pentagon officials dispute the idea that japan enjoys a 
free ride arguing that it provides the bulk of the destroyers 
and combat jets in northeast asia that its military budget of 30 
billion a year is already higher than that of any other us ally 
and that its contribution of 45000 to the annual upkeep of each of 
the 55000 us military personnel based in japan is the most 
generous in the world 
tension also continues over an issue raised by presidential 
contender michael dukakis and other democrats the buying up of 
america in the form of japanese investments in prime us real 
estate and factories defenders such as mansfield ask why nobody 
complains about britains 75 billion worth of direct investment in 
america compared to japanese investments of 33 billion 
names mentioned as early candidates for the tokyo post include 
michael h armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
who has served in tokyo gaston sigur assistant secretary of state 
for east asian and pacific affairs and lamar alexander the former 
tennessee governor instrumental in bringing japanese factories to 
his state 
economic relations between america and japan are so large and 
so crucial to both countries that unless we manage them 
intelligently we could be facing a crisis of enormous dimensions 
says martin weinstein head of japan programs at the center for 
strategic and international studies a washingtonbased private 
research organization 
if the japanese didnt buy our treasury bonds our debt would 
be simply unmanageable weinstein says no other country is in 
that position

farm exports soared to a sixyear peak of 1475 
million metric tons in the year that ended sept 30 and black ink 
in us agricultural trade doubled to more than 14 billion the 
agriculture department says 
japan was again the top customer of the american farmer as it 
has been for more than two decades according to figures released 
monday 
american farm exports climbed from 2787 billion in fiscal 1987 
to 352 billion this past fiscal year a gain of 26 percent while 
imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a record 21 billion 
usda said 
the united states was thus left with a net agricultural trade 
surplus of 142 billion for fiscal 1988 compared with 722 
billion a year earlier 
volume of exports climbed 14 percent from the 1292 million 
metric tons posted in fiscal 1987 with wheat accounting for 
twothirds of the increase usda said a metric ton is equivalent to 
about 2205 pounds 
exports of wheat increased from 282 million metric tons in 1987 
to 405 million tons in the last fiscal year the soviet union and 
china together purchased a total of 146 million tons or 36 percent 
of all us wheat shipments in fiscal 1988 
combined imports by the soviet union and china totaled 495 
million metric tons of american wheat in 1987 or 18 percent of all 
shipments 
japan imported 278 million metric tons of us agricultural 
goods other leading purchasers were the european community 255 
million metric tons the soviet union 159 million metric tons 
south korea 8 million and taiwan 73 million 
besides wheat substantial gains were posted by corn grain 
sorghum feeds and fodders and vegetable oils among products not 
measured on the basis of metric tons the biggest gains were in baby 
chicks live animals fruit juices wines and malt beverages 
the increases were moderated however by weakened foreign demand 
for us soybeans soybean meal and rice 
all of the nations leading foreign markets for farm goods grew 
in fiscal 1988 except that of the european community whose imports 
dropped nearly 11 million metric tons the decrease mainly 
reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean meal 
the soviet union and japan were among the five fastestgrowing 
markets for us agriculture joining china algeria and india 
american highvalue exports such as livestock and horticultural 
products climbed to a record 164 billion in 1988 a gain of 27 
billion or 19 percent over the 1987 level it also represented a 
11 billion gain over the previous peak reached in 1981 
shipments of bulk commodities such as grains zoomed 33 percent 
from 1987 to a total of 188 billion the level topped 25 billion 
in 1984 before immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign 
competition battered prices and sent american agriculture into the 
doldrums 
expanded purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for the 
increase usda said it said the soviet union china and north 
africa were the leading markets for wheat and japan while the 
soviet union and south korea were tops for corn 
agricultural imports of 21 billion were some 250 million or 2 
percent above the 1987 level and about 100 million over the 1986 
mark of 209 billion the previous record high usda said the 
increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead 
reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items 
top suppliers were the european community 412 billion 
canada 237 billion mexico 19 billion brazil 19 billion 
and australia 115 billion products reflecting increases were 
vegetable oil live cattle beef and veal wines and malt beverages 
and nursery products

the domestic bearing industry is operating at 
or near 100 percent capacity the reagan administration said in 
declining to limit imports of the frictionreducing components from 
europe and japan 
the decision announced monday follows a joint study by the 
commerce and defense departments the commerce department had found 
separately in july that us bearing manufacturers would not be able 
to meet all national security requirements in the event of a major 
conventional war 
but president reagan in august tentatively ruled out limits until 
the joint study could be completed the administration wanted to 
ensure that the domestic bearing industry would be sufficiently 
healthy to meet production needs in the event of an emergency 
without the united states having to rely on outside suppliers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the joint study found 
that conditions in the domestic bearing industry had improved 
signficantly in the last several months his statement said that it 
was concluded that administration initiatives should be adequate 
to bring the domestic industrial base into an acceptable posture for 
national security purposes 
commerce secretary c william verity said in a statement that 
reagans decision was made after a thorough review of the impact 
of bearing imports on national security 
while recognizing the critical importance of bearings to 
defense preparedness other administration initiatives already under 
way coupled with significantly improved economic conditions for 
the industry make me confident that this is the right decision 
he said 
the decision against moving to curb imports of bearings was based 
on these conclusions of the government investigators 
current demand for bearings in the united states is at its 
highest level in recent years particularly as bearingconsuming 
industries such as automobiles aerospace and offroad equipment 
experience heavy sales increases 
the us bearing industry has benefited from substantial 
increases in domestic demand and is operating at or near 100 percent 
of capacity 
the industry has attracted significant investment from both 
domestic and foreignowned producers 
a change in defense department acquisition guidelines last 
august which now require the pentagon to use only domestic 
industries for the purchase of bearings for defenserelated 
equipment this could provide the domestic industry with an 
estimated 40 million to 50 million in additional revenue for 
domestic suppliers 
in a separate and unrelated action the commerce department said 
it was aggressively pursuing an investigation of alleged unfair 
trade practices by foreign suppliers of antifriction bearings 
our preliminary findings indicate dumping margins in the 20 to 
80 percent range verity said if the final results of this 
investigation verify these margins the duties imposed could 
contribute to leveling the playing field for this important 
industry 
he said that a final determination on the issue of dumping of 
bearings by foreign competitors in the us market will be due jan 
9 and a decision will be made 45 days later on what kind of actions 
to take 
dumping is the selling of a product in a foreign market at a 
price lower than the domestic price

marlin fitzwater signed on for another hitch 
as white house spokesman says presidentelect george bush will 
have new ways of dealing with the press that may include more 
informal meetings with reporters 
fitzwater 46 has been president reagans chief spokesman since 
february 1987 and was vice president bushs press secretary for two 
years before that 
bush making his first appearance in the white house press 
briefing room since his election nov 8 announced monday that he is 
retaining fitzwater 
it is the first time the press secretary of an outgoing president 
has been named permanently to the job in a new administration 
although pierre salinger served president johnson for an interim 
after president kennedys assassination 
fitzwater declined to say how frequently bush would hold 
presidential news conferences saying the vice president has been 
holding press conferences at the rate of one every five hours for 
the last few weeks so well have to see how that works out 
the new president im sure will have new ways of dealing with 
the press im sure there will be all kinds of interviews and press 
conferences and meetings 
when a reporter observed that bush seems more comfortable than 
reagan in freewheeling giveandtake with reporters fitzwater said 
i would agree with you that the presidentelect is comfortable 
with the press he does operate informally quite effectively 
so i would suspect you might see a lot more informal the 
spokesman said at which point his response was cut off by a 
reporters question as to what he would recommend in the way of news 
conferences 
i wont talk about all the things ive recommended and not 
recommended but well just have to wait and see he said 
i think there should be as much contact with the press as 
possible and it should be as regular as possible the spokesman 
said 
fitzwater is a veteran public affairs official whose federal 
career began in 1972 when he was a speechwriter for secretary of 
transportation john volpe before that fitzwater had worked for 
newspapers in his native kansas 
i think hes the best bush said he represents the old and 
the new he represents the reagan administration and he also 
represents the bush administration this is continuity in the 
best sense 
when asked if he would hold more frequent news conferences than 
reagan the presidentelect said im going to lean heavily on 
marlin for advice on this 
fitzwaters present title is assistant to the president for press 
relations bush said that in the new administration fitzwater will 
be press secretary a title held now by james brady who was wounded 
in the 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan 
when asked whether brady would have a role in the new 
administration fitzwater said i know the vice president is very 
interested in jim and concerned about his wellbeing and that bush 
and his advisers have some ideas of things they would like him to 
do 
fitzwater said sheila tate would remain bushs press secretary 
through the transition and he would take over on jan 20 ms tate 
has said she plans to leave government 
after bush left the briefing room fitzwater opened his 
presentation with a few words of gratitude to the presidentelect 
and president 
then a reporter asked him well will you keep avoiding 
briefings and will you promise to hold more news conferences 
a twominute honeymoon fitzwater said amazing

the reagan administration hailed the new 
ussoviet grain agreement as providing a steady market for 
american farm products but a congressman from americas wheat belt 
said the deal sold growers short 
the plan stabilizes grain trade between our two countries by 
ensuring a secure source of supply for soviet grain imports and 
secure market for us grain exports said a statement from alan 
f holmer chief of the us delegation to the moscow meetings 
under a 27month extension of the longterm agreement between the 
two nations the soviet union is promising to buy at the equivalent 
of at least 9 million metric tons annually of us grain a metric 
ton equals about 2205 pounds 
us and soviet negotiators signed the extension in moscow on 
monday breathing new life into a fiveyear plan that helped to turn 
the soviet union into one of the us farmers best customers that 
agreement had expired sept 30 
the extension will continue to stabilize grain trade between 
the two countries benefiting american farmers agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng and us trade representative clayton k 
yeutter said in a statement 
the agreement calls for the soviets to buy at least 4 million 
metric tons each of wheat and corn annually as well as 1 million 
metric tons of additional wheat corn soybeans and soybean meal or 
any combination of those commodities 
the soviets also are allowed to purchase up to 3 million metric 
tons of additional wheat and corn annually without further 
discussions 
rep dan glickman dkan and chairman of the house agriculture 
committees subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains said 
the pact has done nothing more than maintain the current 
agreement 
this was an historic opportunity with one of our most important 
grain clients and all we can say is we didnt lose any ground he 
said that simply isnt good enough 
this administration has driven down the price of grain in order 
to export more but they dont seem to be able to close the deal 
he said 
the agriculture department said the soviets bought 905 million 
tons of wheat 518 million tons of corn 830700 tons of soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal for delivery in the fifth and 
final year of the current agreement 
the soviets purchased us wheat for the final year and a half of 
the old agreement at federally subsidized prices under the 
governments export enhancement program designed to offset 
competition from the european community and other suppliers 
under the 1985 program the agriculture department pays private 
exporters in kind out of stocks held by the governmentowned 
commodity credit corp to ship the grain at highly attractive 
prices there are no dollar estimates for these sales 
a provision of the old plan carried over into the new version 
allows the soviets to count one ton of soybeans or soybean meal as 
two tons and thus round out their purchase obligation by buying 
500000 tons of those commodities rather than a million tons of 
wheat or corn 
in general our impression is favorable american farm bureau 
federation spokesman joe fields said its a continuation of what 
we had before which worked fairly well 
barry jenkins a spokesman for the national association of wheat 
growers said his members were pleased with the agreement but had 
hoped that the amounts would have been a bit larger 
in any case he said the plan was likely to have less effect on 
prices than will lingering problems caused by the drought he said 
markets mainly would be relieved to get some assurance of continued 
soviet demand 
its like a security blanket for some people jenkins said

sen george mitchell joined the senate eight 
years ago as an appointee who had never won election to public 
office but the maine democrat has since proven himself a popular 
votegetter a thoughtful lawmaker and a telegenic party spokesman 
mitchell a former federal judge won praise for his incisive 
questioning of witnesses before the irancontra investigating panel 
last year he also hushed the hearing room with a statement as 
dramatic as the emotional testimony of lt col oliver north 
although hes regularly asked to do so god does not take sides 
in american politics mitchell lectured the marine and in 
america disagreement with the policies of the government is not 
evidence of lack of patriotism 
mitchells irancontra performance solidified his status as a 
potential majority leader he was first mentioned for the job in 
1986 when as the hardworking head of the democrats senatorial 
campaign committee he led his party back to control of the chamber 
mitchell 55 had less legislative experience than his two 
opponents for senate majority leader and was perceived as more 
liberal 
as chairman of the senates environmental protection 
subcommittee mitchell led a losing fight this year for an 
antipollution bill designed to reduce acid rain smog and airborne 
toxic chemicals his powerful opponents included the current senate 
majority leader robert byrd of west virginia and rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee mitchell also chairs the finance committees health panel 
and has proposed a major longterm health care initiative 
mitchell was appointed to the senate in 1980 to succeed edmund 
muskie whom he had served as an executive assistant two decades 
earlier he won election in 1982 with 61 percent of the vote and 
garnered 81 percent this year 
the son of a utility company laborer and a lebanese immigrant 
mother who worked the midnight shift at a woolen mill for 27 years 
mitchell graduated from bowdoin college spent two years as an army 
intelligence officer and worked as an insurance claims adjuster 
while attending night classes at georgetown university law school 
mitchell lost a 1974 bid to become governor of maine he was 
appointed us attorney for the state in 1977 and two years later 
was named to a new federal judgeship in bangor

daniel k inouye of hawaii the most senior of 
three candidates for senate majority leader is known for his 
solemn deepvoiced presence which commands attention whether during 
a floor debate or at a hearing 
inouye who has been a senator since 1962 earned national 
prominence first as keynote speaker at the democratic national 
convention in 1968 then gained added respect as a member of the 
senate watergate committee in 1973 but the gloss was dulled 
somewhat last year when inouye was criticized for not keeping a firm 
enough handle on hearings before the irancontra investigating panel 
he helped chair 
in that post and as former intelligence committee chairman and a 
senior member of the appropriations committee inouye has prided 
himself on being able to work closely with republicans but he also 
has been a party loyalist backing president johnsons vietnam war 
policy and defending sen harrison williams dnj in 1981 against 
expulsion in the abscam case 
his colleagues made him secretary of the democratic conference 
the no 3 party leadership position leading many to rank him a year 
ago as the top prospect to succeed robert byrd of west virginia as 
majority leader but in recent months inouyes chances seemed to 
fade as some particularly newer senators searched for a less 
ponderous figure to represent their numbers on television 
last year inouye was embarrassed after it was revealed that he 
had slipped into a money bill 8 million for a school in france for 
north african jews he later was forced to rescind the provision 
in recent years his voting record has tended toward the liberal 
side he has favored gun control sanctions against south africa and 
limits on political action committee contributions to candidates he 
has opposed the star wars defense system and aid to the nicaraguan 
contras

sen j bennett johnston is an accomplished 
power broker with a reputation of knowing how to swing legislative 
deals while protecting his own interests 
the louisianan is chairman of the energy and natural resources 
committee and of the energy and water development appropriations 
subcommittee posts from which he watches out for his state and its 
energy industry that was seen by some observers as a possible 
disadvantage in his race for majority leader since the house 
already is led by another oil and gas advocate speaker jim wright 
dtexas 
while known for an easygoing quotable style johnston is quick 
to master details of legislation has a strong grasp of senate 
procedure and is considered a cagey backroom dealmaker 
johnston was more conservative than either of his two rivals for 
majority leader during his second term he was a leading opponent 
of courtordered busing to desegregate schools 
but he now casts himself as a centrist he dramatically came out 
against president reagans nomination of conservative robert bork to 
the supreme court last year supported a bill aimed at reducing 
pollution that causes global warming and fought reagans efforts to 
finance the star wars missile defense system 
in the majority leaders race johnston sold himself as the 
candidate most likely to appeal to middle america and thus as the 
best standardbearer for the democratic party he picked up 
endorsements from two of the partys stars sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas and sen sam nunn of georgia 
now 56 johnston entered the senate in 1973 after a nineyear 
career in the louisiana state legislature

environmental concerns are likely to influence 
the next comprehensive farm bill and threaten some farmers incomes 
unless agricultural interests adopt reforms on their own a 
researcher says 
farmers must modify programs or agriculture must be prepared 
to face environmental legislation says katherine reichelderfer 
coauthor of a paper released monday by the national center for food 
and agricultural policy the center is part of the environmental 
research organization resources for the future 
the study noted that 37 states have passed or are considering 
legislation aimed at agricultural contamination of water 
agriculture is already the largest source of some pollution such 
as nutrients reaching waterways pesticides have been found for 
example in 40 percent of the wells in iowa 
the paper surveyed existing research documenting environmental 
harm from farming as practiced today with massive government 
involvement in restricting acreage supporting farm income and 
controlling supply 
growing environmental concern could mean modification of farm 
subsidy programs or new environmental controls that could reduce the 
income of some farmers the study said 
the net effect of the current combination of farm program 
instruments include the following more acreage is retained in the 
agricultural sector than would be the case in the absence of farm 
programs but less acreage is cultivated and agricultural chemical 
use rates and crop yields per acre are higher the study said 
ending all price support programs while keeping current 
conservation requirements would increase the number of acres 
planted to crops but would result in environmentally beneficial 
relocation and mix of production activities with less intensive and 
less damaging use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage 
it said 
however farm income would decline agricultural exports would 
fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would suffer 
reichelderfer said the environmental benefits probably would 
not outweigh the costs 
nonetheless polls have shown what i consider a rather dramatic 
increase in public concern about agricultural sources of pollution 
particularly contamination of drinking water sources she said 
youre probably going to see even more participation by the 
environmental community in shaping the next farm bill tentatively 
on the congressional agenda for 1990 said the studys other author 
tim phipps 
environmentalists were influential in adding the sodbuster 
and swampbuster provisions to the 1985 bill forbidding 
subsidies to farmers who convert grasslands and swamps to crops and 
in fashioning the conservation reserve aimed at retiring 45 million 
acres of erodible land from production through rent payments to 
farmers who convert it to grassland or forest for 10 years 
the paper discussed in detail three possible modifications to 
current programs removing the link between production and income 
support that current commodityoriented price supports provide 
gradually ending all price supports and expansion of the 
conservation reserve 
other possibilities mentioned were taxes on pesticides subsidies 
to encourage socalled low input farming or lowchemical 
integrated pest management and more research on alternatives to 
chemicaldependent farming

a japanese department store said today that it 
bought pablo picassos acrobat and young harlequin for a record 
3846 million and plans to sell the rose period masterpiece to a 
buyer in tokyo 
the pinkandrose painting of two circus performers sold monday 
for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created 
in this century 
it also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned 
it is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by vincent 
van gogh sold in 1987 irises at 539 million and 
sunflowers at 413 million 
yasuhiro tanaka a spokesman for mitsukoshi department store 
said in tokyo that its representative akio nishino bought the 
picasso painting at the christies auction in london on behalf of 
the store 
we bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer 
here in tokyo tanaka said 
but he said the store which is a major importer of art into 
japan had not decided on specific plans for displaying or selling 
the painting 
nishino left the crowded saleroom after buying the painting and 
slumped in a chair in a private room for 20 minutes 
he didnt speak to reporters but wore a big smile a director 
said the man was emotionally exhausted 
we offered him a glass of champagne but he didnt like it and 
had cocacola instead said mark wrey spokesman for the auction 
house 
the buyer told me he had bought a most wonderful masterpiece 
he didnt question the price he was very excited 
japans imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years 
as increasingly affluent japanese turn to collecting as a form of 
investment 
japans yasuda fire and marine insurance co bought van goghs 
sunflowers when it was sold at christies in london in march 
1987 dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art 
sales are to japanese buyers often large corporations that buy for 
taxfree investment purposes 
picasso painted acrobat and young harlequin in 1905 in his 
paris attic studio at 13 rue ravignon using gouache an opaque 
watercolor easier to handle than oil paint 
after being shown in paris in 1905 it found its way into a 
german museum and was confiscated by the nazis in 1937 as an example 
of decadent art they sold it at auction in switzerland to a belgian 
collector and it had been in private hands since 
bidding on monday opened at 92 million and the painting sold 
in 3 minutes 
the selling price topped the previous record for a 20th century 
painting 2475 million paid for picassos maternity nov 14 in 
new york 
auctioneer charles allsopp said the price was not exorbitant 
by any standard picasso was the towering figure of art in this 
century this picture was from his rose period which is usually 
considered his best and its the last great work of that series 
likely to come on the market allsopp said 
in the 27 years ive been here it has gripped more people and 
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture 
it has had practically no detractors even among those who dont 
like picasso 
a picture by the french impressionist claude monet the 
railroad bridge at argenteuil sold for 1255 million also 
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at 
auction 
in june 28 another monet painting in the field sold at 
sothebys in london for 2490 million 
mondays auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought 10201 
million a record for an impressionist and modern art sale in 
london individual records were set for works by picasso paul

and to an agreement by members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to reduce crude production 
major us banks boosted their prime lending rates by a half 
percentage point to 105 percent the fourth increase this year 
higher us interest rates increase the attractiveness of 
dollardenominated investments 
opec agreed monday to set a daily production quota of 185 
million barrels down from its estimated 225 millionbarrel current 
production and a target price of 18 a barrel the announcement

agreement on exchange rates mostly psychological and said the pact 
would not have an immediate effect on the world economy

peter puget circa 1792 would be proud the 
meager waterway bearing his name has grown to encompass much of 
western washingtons inland sea lanes but critics say the expansion 
dilutes the sounds identity 
some would stretch the edge of puget sound even farther to 
canadas door but a northwest guide and amateur historian says 
puget sound has gone far enough 
harvey manning author of guides to the trails of western 
washington would put the cutoff point near the north end of the 
kitsap peninsula across from the southern tip of whidbey island to 
make his point he would draw the line at point no point 20 miles 
north of seattle 
it dilutes the identity of puget sound to spread it over too 
much water and it lessens the identity of the other waterways 
manning said 
capt don schwartzman chairman of the state pilotage commission 
and a 25year veteran of the state ferry system agreed with that 
assessment 
any chart clearly shows that cutoff mark is the place where 
admiralty inlet links the strait of juan de fuca with puget sound 
he said 
however the borders ordered by the us board of geographic 
names dont quite comply with that description and those with 
commerce in mind have much more divergent views 
we figure ourselves as being on the north end of puget sound 
said gary smith manager of the chamber of commerce in anacortes 40 
miles north of point no point 
puget sound includes us said mike brennan executive vice 
president of the bellingham chamber of commerce 20 miles north of 
anacortes 
smith said being part of puget sound even when one is not helps 
promote the area to outsiders 
it gives an association with the larger metropolitan area of 
seattle he said for the most part we promote this area as 
being part of the san juan islands but when people ask us wheres 
that we say in puget sound north of seattle 
that disregards such waters as rosario strait saratoga passage 
the strait of georgia and the bays of skagit bellingham and 
padilla said manning 
those who extend puget sound past certain borders to include 
everything wet except martinis and rain are wrong he said the 
real names will die as newcomers are fed the puget sound pablum 
he said 
they dont have the right to make such a radical change he 
said 
capt george vancouver the british explorer first used the name 
after he sailed into the regions inland waters in 1792 he named 
the southern waters of what is now puget sound after one of his ship 
captains peter puget the name applied only to meandering inlets 
south of what is now tacoma 
the main channel north of the tacoma narrows to the strait of 
juan de fuca named by earlier spanish explorers was named 
admiralty inlet 
in 1869 congress changed the description of puget sound to a 
general all the waters connected with the strait of juan de fuca 
within the territory of the united states

one of the nations top psychiatrists resigned from 
harvard medical schools faculty after a student at another school 
recognized plagiarized passages in the professors writings dating 
back 22 years 
dr shervert frazier 67 former director of the national 
institute of mental health resigned last week as a harvard 
professor and head of mclean hospital a psychiatric hospital 
affiliated with the university 
frazier did not dispute the findings of a faculty committee that 
investigated the allegations but said the plagiarism was 
inadvertent according to dr s james adelstein dean of academic 
programs at the medical school 
he has accepted the evidence of the committee adelstein 
said but he has ascribed the events to his method of notetaking 
and composing papers 
harvard officials said monday the plagiarism was spotted by paul 
scatena a graduate student in cognitive sciences at the university 
of rochester 
scatena said in a telephone interview he read several of 
fraziers papers while researching phantom pain a burning sensation 
that patients sometimes feel from a limb that has been amputated 
scatena said he found many incorrect citations in the papers and 
recognized paragraphs that had been lifted from articles by other 
researchers he said he sent the passages to dr daniel c tosteson 
dean of the harvard medical school in august 
tosteson announced fraziers resignation in a nov 23 letter to 
the faculty the letter made public by the university monday says 
a faculty committee investigated the allegations and concluded that 
plagiarism occurred in four papers written by frazier between 1966 
and 1975 
frazier could not be reached for comment monday spokesmen at 
harvard and mclean hospital said he was out of town and unreachable 
he did not return messages left at the hospital and the phone at 
his home went unanswered 
three of the discredited papers are about phantom pain the 
fourth is on psychiatric emergency management 
the papers which were published in medical journals and 
textbooks were intended as teaching instruments and did not 
purport to present new research data adelstein said 
one of fraziers colleagues said he thought the forced 
resignation was an overreaction 
its not as if he stole a great idea from someone or published 
someone elses research as if it was his own said dr seymour 
kety professor emeritus of psychiatry and senior scientist at the 
national institute of health 
but dr miles shore director of the massachusetts mental health 
center said academic institutions have a very important 
obligation to guarantee the scientific integrity of what goes on 
within their walls and i think harvard took the appropriate action 
and harvard spokesman peter costa said the university takes 
very seriously any charges of plagiarism because thats what were 
about the search for truth and knowledge 
the university has been hit by other allegations of scientific 
misconduct in recent years in 1981 john r darsee was stripped of 
his position as a heart researcher for allegedly falsifying data 
this year scheffer cg tseng left his post at massachusetts eye 
and ear infirmary after he was accused of changing his test methods 
and violating harvards conflictofinterest rules in promoting an 
experimental eye drug 
also this year harvard medical school issued new guidelines for 
researchers in an effort to prevent academic fraud the school also 
said it would consider appointing professors on the basis of only 
five to 10 papers a move aimed at reducing the publish or 
perish pressure that sometimes underlies fraud 
frazier was a professor of psychiatry at harvard from 1972 until 
1984 when he left to become director of the national institute of 
mental health in rockville md he returned to harvard in 1986 to 
become head of mclean one of the nations leading psychiatric 
hospitals 
he has worked at the mayo clinic presbyterian hospital in new 
york and baylor university among other institutions he is a former 
commissioner of mental health and mental retardation in texas

the attorney for a pathologist 
accused of murder in the mercy killing his cancerstricken wife 
rested his case without presenting any testimony saying the states 
evidence was weak 
surprise your honor the defense rests stanley rosenblatt 
attorney for dr peter rosier said after a lunch break monday 
i dont think they came close to proving any crime 
lee county circuit judge james thompson who rejected defense 
requests for acquittal and a mistrial declaration scheduled closing 
arguments for wednesday he said he would meet with attorneys today 
to prepare jury instructions 
rosier 47 is charged with firstdegree murder attempted 
firstdegree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of 
his terminally ill wife patricia nearly three years ago 
during the thanksgiving weekend rosenblatt discussed strategy 
with his client he said he considered putting the rosiers two 
children jacob 19 and elizabeth 22 on the stand as character 
witnesses the decision to rest without calling a witness was not 
made until monday the attorney said 
the decision means rosenblatt will have the final say to the jury 
in rebuttal remarks 
the prosecution contended mrs rosier failed in a suicide attempt 
by taking 20 seconal sedatives 
rosier a retired fort meyers pathologist then bungled an 
attempt to kill his wife with morphine injections and suppositories 
so mrs rosiers stepfather vincent delman smothered her to end 
her suffering assistant state attorney ed volz contended 
the doctor hoped to profit from his wifes painful death through 
his unpublished book which he wanted to turn into a screenplay 
volz maintained 
mrs rosier wanted to commit suicide to avoid a horrible death 
from cancer that had spread from her lungs to other organs said 
rosenblatt 
rosier acted out of compassion and did nothing that could have 
killed his wife of 23 years rosenblatt said 
mrs rosier 43 died jan 15 1986 her lagging health and death 
were chronicled by a fort myers television station broadcasts 
quoting rosier as saying he played a role in her death prompted the 
murder investigation 
before prosecutors knew of delmans role he was given immunity 
in return for his testimony

more than 850 people were arrested in unrest 
between ethnic armenians and azerbaijanis and portraits of iranian 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini have appeared on the streets of 
the azerbaijani capital soviet media reported 
the government newspaper izvestia printed an interview with 
26yearold nemat panakhov said to have led rallies by thousands of 
protesters on bakus lenin square 
izvestia correspondents asked him to explain why we saw green 
flags and portraits of khomeini on the square it quoted panakhov 
as saying leaders of the protests rejected such appeals to moslem 
fundamentalism 
azerbaijanis are predominantly moslem and their neighbors the 
armenians are predominantly christian both republics border on 
iran and the soviet union is concerned about the possibility of 
khomeinis fundamentalist moslem revolution in iran spreading across 
the frontier to soviet central asia 
no new outbreaks of violence were reported in the troubled 
southern republics where at least seven people including four 
soldiers were killed in ethnic violence last week 
a strict curfew remained in effect several cities including baku 
and the armenian capital yerevan soldiers and tanks patrolled the 
streets 
the soviet tv news program vremya said most factories in 
yerevan were closed monday and the situation in baku remained 
complicated and strained 
official baku radio in a report monitored in london said 867 
people were arrested in the azerbaijani capital on sunday night and 
monday morning and that 18 of them were jailed 
quoting a report from the citys military commandant it said 
there were about 10000 people on lenin square while the curfew is 
in force many citizens are staying away from their houses and these 
people are violating the special situation 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said in a telephone interview 
that khachik stamultyan a recently elected deputy to the armenian 
supreme soviet was detained and later released for speaking to a 
crowd on a yerevan street 
stamultyan is a member of the committee pressing to have the 
predominantly armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh which is inside 
azerbaijan annexed to armenia azerbaijan and national authorities 
have rejected such a move 
there is nothing new in the town yerevan popoyan said 
soldiers ask any group of more than three to disperse even knots 
of people at bus stops 
officials and the state media have said three of the four dead 
soldiers were killed in the first wave of violence last week in the 
azerbaijani cities of nakhichevan and kirovabad when interior 
ministry troops stepped in to control rioting the fourth death was 
reported sunday in the military newspaper red star which said a 
soldier was run over deliberately by a truck 
the remaining three victims were azerbaijanis killed in 
kirovabad by soldiers for violating the 10 pm to 5 am curfew 
according to a local communist party official

a chinese activist said in an essay published 
today that foreign countries should invest in his country only on 
condition the communist government makes progress in human rights 
ren wanding also criticized beijing of depriving its citizens of 
basic rights of citizenship such as voting in meaningful 
elections 
his comments appeared in the englishlanguage south china morning 
post the hong kong paper said the essay broke a 10year silence by 
the activist who was jailed for four years after figuring 
prominently in the democracy movement of 197879 
dissidents were allowed at the time to air their views by pasting 
character posters on a small beijing wall known as democracy 
wall but the government soon cracked down 
ren founded the human rights alliance in 1978 and authored a 
19point human rights declaration before he was taken into custody 
in march 1979 the post said 
in the essay translated from chinese to english by the 
newspaper ren recalled the movement he helped spearhead 
the democracy wall dared to expose the problem of lifelong 
tenure in office the fact that ownership by the people is state 
ownership the existence of unemployment and surplus labor and many 
other economic truths about china he wrote 
since the democracy movement china has opened to the outside 
world and sought overseas investment in a bid for modernization but 
ren urged foreign countries not to place more money in china until 
certain changes occur 
industrially developed countries investing in china and 
providing economic aid should take into consideration the reform of 
chinas social structure the expansion of democratic institutions 
and the release of political prisoners wrote ren a 44yearold 
electrician 
progress on these fronts should be a condition for investment 
enhancing the power of an unreformed state suggests greater 
suppression of the people who will sooner or later react 
ren frequently returned to the theme of democratic change which 
he said was essential to china 
in 1949 the communist party came to power through force now 
it should let the people decide their future through the ballot 
box ren said for the next few decades at least china is 
likely to be a confused and unstable place 
such outspoken calls for democracy are rare in china 
astrophysicist fang lizhi is the most prominent active dissident 
frequently criticizing the communist government and questioning 
marxism 
wei jingsheng a former electrician at the beijing zoo was the 
leading dissident in the democracy wall era but has been in jail 
since 1979 when he was sentenced on charges of supplying military 
secrets to a foreign power and agitating to topple the chinese 
socialist system

a 400 million investment could help 
scientists harness antimatter perhaps leading to faster spacecraft 
and better ways to treat cancer and detect flaws in complex 
machines a rand corp study says 
we are on the threshold of important advances in the basic 
science of antimatter and its practical applications but as 
tantalizingly near as that may be the rewards cannot be realized 
without a program such as we are advocating said bruno 
augenstein a physicist at the think tank 
the rand report stems from a 1987 meeting of 80 experts on 
antimatter they detailed experiments needed if they are to harness 
antimatter augenstein determined such research would cost about 
400 million over 10 years 
recognizing federal budget deficits the air forcesponsored 
report stopped short of urging the expenditure although it said 
such spending would be warranted 
rand said the government universities and industry should spend 
30 million jointly over three years to modify an atom smasher to 
produce one quadrillion antimatter particles annually and to develop 
devices that can store the particles called antiprotons for 
practical uses 
antimatter has a very buzzwordy goshgeewilly impact upon the 
general public people immediately think of star trek but the 
exotic substance really exists said physicist michael nieto of los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
for each type of particle in matter there is a corresponding 
particle of antimatter that has the same mass but an opposite 
electric charge protons are positively charged particles in atoms 
of matter antiprotons are their negatively charged antimatter 
counterparts 
if you had a twin brother made out of antimatter you would 
literally annihilate each other in a big explosion of light and 
energy if you came into contact said nieto who coedited a book 
of technical papers from the 1987 conference 
such explosions could be harnessed as rocket fuel although that 
would be the most difficult practical application to develop 
augenstein and nieto said 
antimatter is a promising rocket fuel because a tiny amount can 
produce as much energy as a huge tank of chemical rocket fuel so 
you only have to carry a small amount of antimatter into orbit to 
carry you to mars nieto said 
antimatterpowered spacecraft would be lighter faster and able 
to carry heavier payloads farther than existing rockets augenstein 
said 
if the 400 million is spent antiprotons could be available in a 
decade for radiation therapy for cancer patients he said unlike 
existing methods antiproton beams could be targeted so precisely 
the particles would destroy only a tumor with minimal damage to 
intervening tissue augenstein said 
compared with xrays cat scans and magnetic resonance imaging 
antiprotons should produce more accurate easiertointerpret 
pictures of the inside of the human body to help doctors diagnose 
cancers and other diseases augenstein said nieto said antiprotons 
also would expose patients to much less radiation 
pictures made using antiprotons instead of xrays also should 
make it 1000 times faster to detect and weld cracks or other flaws 
in industrial materials and machines such as airplane parts rocket 
nozzles and turbine blades augenstein said 
nieto said a reliable source of antiprotons also would help 
physicists study the fundamental properties of matter and 
antimatter and the fundamental forces which act upon them 
the report said antiprotons could be massproduced by modifying 
an existing proton accelerator either at fermi national accelerator 
laboratory in illinois or at brookhaven national laboratory on long 
island ny 
three existing atom smashers or particle accelerators now 
create antiprotons but each yields trillions of the particles each 
year far fewer than scientists need 
storing antimatter requires keeping it from contact with matter 
augenstein said magnetic fields could be used to hold them in ion 
traps or keep them circulating in storage rings

civil rights laws to combat violence against abortion clinics 
now president molly yard on monday likened violent attacks on 
abortion clinics to terrorism although the reagan administration is 
concerned enough with international terrorism to deny plo leader 
yasser arafat a visa to address the united nations it ignores the 
terrorists already operating in this country she said 
yard said at a news conference that the administration has made 
little response to nows repeated requests for greater enforcement 
the justice department which refused comment has prosecuted 
some antiabortion activists for civil rights violations in

the defense department will send questionnaires 
next month to more than 34000 men and women in the armed forces 
plus 4000 in the coast guard in one of the most extensive surveys 
ever undertaken to spotlight sexual harassment in the workplace 
the written survey will ask if they have ever been the victims of 
uninvited unwanted sexual attention 
the merit systems protection board which conducted a similar 
survey among civilian government workers last year polled a sample 
of about 13000 fulltime federal workers and received responses 
from 8500 
the military survey was ordered last february by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci in response to a recommendation from a 
special task force the panel concluded that sexual harassment was a 
serious problem for women in the armed forces and that the services 
should open additional jobs to females

communist leader nicolae ceausescu of 
romania appears to have backed off from a controversial plan to raze 
up to 7000 villages many of them home to ethnic hungarians 
ceausescu speaking monday to the communist party central 
committee in bucharest made no mention of criticism from the west 
and from neighboring hungary which fears the plan will destroy the 
cultural heritage of about 17 million ethnic hungarians in romania 
the village plan made public in april called for the razing of 
the villages and the resettlement of residents in new housing in 
agroindustrial centers 
romanian officials said the plan was aimed at gaining more 
farmland for use by stateowned collective farms 
but some foreigners including former us ambassador to romania 
david funderburk said ceausescus motive was to wipe out evidence 
of romanias capitalist and religious past 
by destroying much of what is creative and beautiful historic 
churches monuments and fortresses in romanias past mr 
ceausescu hopes to separate the people from their culture and 
heritage funderburk wrote last month in the british magazine the 
economist 
ceausescu cited the need monday to preserve unspecified communes 
or groups of villages to prevent depopulation of the countryside 
we have in mind the preservation of the number of communes and 
in a few counties even the development of a few communal centers 
which have been depopulated ceausescu was quoted as saying by the 
official news agency agerpres 
he said many romanians were migrating to towns to work in 
factories where they get higher salaries than in agriculture 
thats why resolute measures are needed for preventing the 
depopulation of rural settlements for organizing them on a modern 
basis and creating conditions likely to provide inhabitants with 
everything they need for a decent civilized life ceausescu said 
ceausescus comments drew differing interpretations 
its clear that ceausescu is backing off from his original 
statements not because of mounting international opposition but due 
to lack of money and materials said a former highranking 
official in the romanian party who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to a summary of the speech distributed by agerpres 
ceausescu departed from recent practice by not once mentioning the 
controversial village scheme by name last spring he said at least 
half of romanias 13000 villages must disappear 
the central committee is holding its threeday meeting to review 
romanias longterm economic plans until the year 2000 agerpres did 
not say why the meeting originally scheduled for september was 
delayed for two months

boston universitys slightly relaxed rules for 
dormitory guests dont go far enough said a student who helped 
organize vigorous protests of a ban on overnight visitors of the 
opposite sex 
university president john silber on monday announced he had 
accepted the recommendations of a task force that decided to allow 
some overnight guests the task force of parents students faculty 
and school officials was commissioned after thousands of students 
demonstrated against the ban 
silber limited overnight guests of the opposite sex to family 
members visits between 11 pm and 1 am would have to be approved 
in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance 
but students remain forbidden from being overnight hosts to 
unrelated members of the opposite sex and kevin carleton a 
spokesman for the 27000student private school said the rules 
changes probably wont go into effect until next fall 
the recommendations dont make the rules palatable because they 
dont substantially change the original decision said susheel 
srikonda who along with another student formed a group called 
active concerned together act to fight the new policies 
act wanted to take a different approach that would emphasize 
roommate approval and give the resident assistants who are in charge 
of dormitories a larger role he said 
they are not changed that much said srikonda a 20yearold 
computer science major 
carleton disagreed 
the initial policy that was proposed was that there be no 
overnight guests he said the tone of it was to discourage 
overnight guests this is saying that there certainly can be 
overnight guests it describes the format in which that can occur 
the ban announced in september drew wide attention including 
that of television talkshow host phil donahue who visited campus 
to interview administration officials and student leaders 
silber said he approved the ban because parents are in a 
proportion of about 30 to 1 were opposed to overnight visitors of 
the opposite sex 
he conceded the university which has a dormitory population of 
about 8500 cannot police dormitories rigorously but said the 
school is obliged to discourage certain behavior

sothebys withdrew an ancient bronze vessel from 
a sale of chinese artifacts scheduled for today after the chinese 
government said the item had been stolen in june from a chinese 
museum 
the item was withdrawn from the auction of fine chinese 
ceramics and works of arts at least two weeks ago after sothebys 
received a description of the missing museum piece from a 
representative of the chinese government said a sothebys 
spokesman matthew weigman 
he said sothebys was holding the ritual vessel called a dui 
pending a resolution of the dispute between the owner and china 
according to the official xinhua news agency in beijing chinas 
interpol office notified its us counterpart saturday of the theft 
and chinese police met monday with a us embassy official to ask 
washingtons help in recovering the object 
the chinese government report said chinese police identified the 
dui from a color photograph in a sothebys catalog which did not 
identify the owner and said it was expected to sell for 60000 to 
80000 
the vessel was made during chinas warring states period from 
475 bc to 221 bc a period of conflict among rival princes 
before what is now northern china was unified under the first 
emperor 
chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape 
decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen june 4 from the 
qu yuan museum in zigui county in central chinas hubei province 
the thieves remain at large 
the dui was excavated in the county in 1983 
an expert at beijings palace museum said craftsmen at the time 
the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces 
millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of china 
each year most through hong kong some are stolen from museums but 
most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb robbers 
and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study them 
weigman said an auction would actually be the worst possible 
place to dispose of a stolen object because the process which 
includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of 
every item is so public 
in april sothebys withdrew a bronze statue of a roman god from 
auction after experts determined that the statue belonged to the 
musee des beaux arts et darcheologie in besancon france the 
statue worth 5000 had been stolen in 1914 and was being sold 
through the new york auction house by the st louis art museum the 
st louis museum acquired it in 1953 from a donor who apparently did 
not know it had been stolen 
two scholars who saw the statue in a sothebys catalog questioned 
its authenticity speculating it might be a copy of the missing 
bronze experts determined that in fact it was the missing bronze

a top arms control expert has resigned as 
codirector of the stanford universitys center for international 
security and arms control because of the procedure used to appoint 
the centers faculty 
physicist sidney drell complained monday that he was stymied 
in efforts to build a multidisciplinary faculty because university 
rules say center appointments must come through existing departments 
such as history or science 
the centers students and scholars come from a wide variety of 
departments and onefourth of the universitys graduating seniors 
now earn degrees in such programs as human biology international 
relations and public policy 
drell said appointments of some of the centers best students to 
professorial positions have been blocked because of university rules 
the center recently was cited by an independent 
foundationsponsored evaluation as the premier trainer of students 
and scholars in arms control sharing honors with the massachusettes 
institute of technology for its research work 
drells resignation is effective next aug 31 he will return to 
the stanford linear accelerator center as deputy director 
with my departure several of my outstanding younger 
colleagues who have helped me build a strong research and training 
program in technical issues of security and arms control are now 
planning to leave drell said 
i hope that this loss is only temporary and that before too 
long new means can be designed within the university structure to 
rebuild this part of the program 
university officials conceded the appointment procedure is a 
problem 
his evident disappointment with the administrations response 
to his request points up a difficult problem for us and the provost 
and i will continue to wrestle with it in consultation with the 
faculty said stanford president donald kennedy 
earlier this year the faculty senate created an ad hoc committee 
to study the entire appointment process drell said he was sure the 
issue would be discussed by the committee 
drell is a close friend of soviet physicist andrei sakharov and 
has been a government advisor on arms control for more than 20 
years hes played a fundamental role in the direction of star wars 
research advocating continued study but criticizing some aspects of 
the program

defense minister yitzhak rabin urged his labor 
party today to consider joining a coalition government led by the 
rival likud bloc to keep out smaller parties whose demands for 
religious legislation has angered american jews 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of likud has offered labor two 
senior cabinet ministries if the leftleaning party joins a 
broadbased government 
labor leaders are meeting wednesday to consider the offer and 
some party officials predicted a showdown between laborites willing 
to compromise and those who want to sit in parliament as an 
opposition party 
the public is worried about the country and not about settling 
small scores rabin said today on army radio the reality we are 
facing requires the party to seriously examine the possibilities of 
establishing a broadbased government 
likud has offered labor the defense ministry meaning rabin would 
be able to keep his job if labor joins the government 
in the first stage after the elections the two large parties 
pursued the religious parties in an exaggerated way and i was a 
partner to that rabin said referring to the parties offers to 
pass religious legislation 
it is clear to us now that this included promises to change 
things that could create a rift between israel and the jewish 
nation it seems to me if there is a possibility to prevent 
this it will be by establishing a joint government rabin said 
likud won 40 parliamentary seats to labors 39 in nov 1 
elections for the 120member knesset it was chosen to form the 
government because of its alliances with small rightwing and 
ultraorthodox religious parties 
but the religious parties squabbles over cabinet posts and their 
demand for controversial legislation have entangled likuds effort 
the religious parties want a law that would accept only 
conversions to judaiam performed by orthodox rabbis angering 
american jews who mostly belong to the reform or conservative 
movements 
among the stumbling blocks to laborlikud negotiations to form a 
government are whether likud will offer its leftwing rival an equal 
number of ministries and what job labor leader shimon peres will get 
peres is now foreign minister but his party and likud have sharp 
differences over foreign policy that became stronger in the election 
campaign 
peres pressed in the campaign for giving up occupied land in 
exchange for peace and opening negotiations with the palestinians 
through an international peace conference 
shamir refuses to give up any of the west bank and gaza strip and 
offers to negotiate only a limited autonomy for palestinians with 
the final status of the occupied lands to be worked out later 
uzi baram labors generalsecretary predicted a tough fight 
within the party over whether to join a likudled government 
i am against negotiating with the likud and i will express 
this in the labor meeting i believe there will be stubborn 
resistance in the partys central committee he said 
if labor joins a broadbased government under likud it would be 
similar to the cabinet that has ruled since 1984 elections gave 
neither labor nor likud enough seats to form a government without 
the other 
in the new government however shamir would likely be prime 
minister for the entire fouryear term under the powersharing 
agreement reached after the 1984 vote shamir and peres each held 
the top post for two year

some of the 10 men who will take their places 
as freshman us senators next year felt awed by a sense of history 
but others simply wanted to find their way from here to there 
monday was orientation day for the senate class of 1988 and 
while the five democrats and five republicans all talked of tackling 
the federal governments massive deficit their immediate concerns 
were more mundane staff and office space telephones security and 
legislative procedure 
committee assignments were a pressing matter 
there was much talk of exactly how low their place will be in the 
pecking order of the senates seniority system 
everybodys worrying about numbers whether theyll be number 
95 96 97 98 or whatever said senelect conrad burns rmont 
i said boys you cant get any lower than 100 
thats burns number one hundred and dead last in seniority 
rep connie mack rfla figured he would be about 94th in 
seniority when all was said and done 
what does that get you he was asked 
not very much to tell you the truth he replied 
there are other numbers involved 
sen robert byrd dwva an ardent amateur historian who keeps 
track of such things says that since the first senate convened in 
1789 there have been precisely 1782 united states senators 
when the 10 newcomers are sworn in with the convening of the 
101st congress in january they will be numbered 1783 to 1792 
depending how on the final determination of their seniority is made 
under the senates complicated rules and procedures for such things 
but for now some of the members of the class of 88 were fairly 
glowing even as they paid attention to what several called the 
nuts and bolts details of senate life 
its a special day a red letter day a very personal day that 
youll never forget said senelect herb kohl dwis but its 
also like going to college as a freshman 
think of it father and mother immigrants 65 years ago had 
nothing and now their son is a united states senator 
the son has a little more than nothing a multimillionaire who 
spent some 5 million on his election campaign kohl is owner of the 
milwaukee bucks basketball team 
burns a montana farm broadcaster who upset sen john melcher 
dmont was asked to name the biggest challenge he faces as a new 
senator 
the biggest challenge to me is getting from here to there 
without walking through all these cameras he said waving a hand 
toward the forest of television cameras sprouting from the floor of 
a senate corridor 
the new democratic senators quickly found themselves the center 
of attention from three senate veterans sens daniel k inouye 
dhawaii bennett johnston dla and george mitchell dmaine all 
sought votes in their bids to succeed byrd as senate majority leader 
kohl said he would vote for mitchell because hes a person i 
feel comfortable with 
joe lieberman of connecticut said he would make up his mind at 
the last minute adding that because he didnt know any of the three 
candidates all that well it comes down to a decision you make in 
your gut 
still there was a sense of wonder at being in a position to make 
such a choice at all 
i feel a sense of history said lieberman its not going 
to be an easy time to be a united states senator he said citing 
budget deficits taxes and environmental problems 
senelect charles robb a democratic former governor of 
virginia was told that the most frustrated senators are former 
governors shorn of the ability to make executive decisions on their 
own authority 
thou sayest it said robb who had little to say on any other 
subject 
three members of the house mack trent lott rmiss and james 
jeffords rvt are moving across the capitol to the senate 
for mack being one of 100 senators is a lot better than being 
one of 435 members of the house with its restrictive trafficcop 
rules 
you have a much greater opportunity in the senate to influence 
legislation on the floor mack said 
but for lott becoming a member of the senate wasnt an automatic 
step up he gave up his no 2 position in the house republican 
leadership to run for the seat being vacated by sen john stennis 
dmiss a senate veteran 
you look at the house and the senate and there certainly are a 
lot of differences lott grumbled like why it takes three 
months in the senate to move in 10 guys when in the house they move 
in 43 people in 30 days 
one new senatortobe washington state republican slade gorton 
was making his second debut as a freshman he was defeated by 
democrat brock adams in 1986 but reinstated by the voters on nov 8 
sen alan dixon dill who has been in the senate for eight 
years was asked if he had any advice for the newcomers 
ill tell them to pray a lot he said grinning

has already closed once and at the editor of an antiapartheid 
newspaper now under suspension 
botha has the power under the 29month state of emergency to 
close newspapers without giving reasons three newspapers have been 
closed temporarily by him this year 
stateofemergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest 
security force actions treatment of detainees some forms of 
protest and a range of statements the government considers 
subversive enforcement of the regulations has not been 
comprehensive 
the star said botha through the state attorney was demanding 
100000 rand 41800 for defamation and impairment of his dignity 
the newspaper said police are also investigating it for alleged 
violations of laws dealing with the police and prisons because of a 
photograph and a guest editorial it published 
on friday botha demanded damage payments from new nation a 
black newspaper published by the southern african catholic bishops 
conference for publishing excerpts of a speech by anton harber 
coeditor of the weekly mail in the speech harber criticized 
bothas threemonth banning of his newspaper and referred to the 
cabinet minister as narrowminded 
botha is threatening to sue new nation and harber a total of 
100000 rand 41800 unless they pay him directly 
the weekly mail is due to resume publishing friday new nation 
resumed publication june 30 after botha banned it for three months 
the government also has threatened action against a new 
afrikaanslanguage weekly vrye weekblad for allegedly promoting 
the aims of outlawed organizations such as the african national 
congress 
bothas allegation that the star defamed him is based in part on 
a feature nov 13 in the papers sunday magazine the article said 
on the political gossip front its hard to beat the restaurant at 
the houses of parliament this starstudded setting inspires 
comments like stoffel bothas the only man i know who walks 
upright without a spine 
the other item in the star cited by botha was a letter to the 
editor from a reader david mumford published on nov 14 the 
letter described botha as a greater danger to south africa than 
the anc and criticized the banning of the weekly mail 
the star said police were investigating the paper because of an 
aug 23 article by a member of the black sash a civil rights group 
criticizing pending legislation to increase evictions of black 
squatters and because of the publication of a photograph of 
imprisoned anc leader nelson mandela 
it is illegal in south africa to publish pictures of mandela but 
a star editor said the only picture of him the paper had published 
was one taken from a government publication 
the anc is the chief guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow the 
south african government and end apartheid

since najib is not sincere to his own mother how can he be 
sincere to the nation asked mohammad gul he said najibs mother 
fahima now was under virtual house arrest

his status in khad the afghan version of the soviet kgb to forge 
papers and bribe his way out of afghanistan

family surname spoke at a news conference organized by the new 
delhi office of hezbiislami the pakistanbased group is one of 
seven factions fighting najibs forces and their soviet military 
backers in afghanistan 
mohammad gul said he has been granted refugee status in india by 
the new delhi office of the un high commissioner for refugees

month ago still was pending 
the escapee said he and his wife left kabul on oct 28 and flew 
to new delhi where they were met by guerrilla representatives 
my plan is to actively join the mujahedeen guerrillas i 
would like to go back to afghanistan and fight russians said

siddiqullah entered pakistan with the guerrillas and accused najib 
of arranging the murder of their father siddiqullah offered no 
proof he later went to the united states 
mohammad gul who spoke in pushtu through a guerrilla 
interpreter said at least 10 of najibs close relatives have sought 
refuge outside afghanistan

common in islamic societies my mother and najibs mother are 
sisters and my father and najibs father are brothers he said 
mohammad gul said his brother noorullah a deputy minister of 
tribal affairs and najib forced him to go to moscow in 1987 for a 
sixmonth secret police training course afterwar he returned to 
kabul and soon became a brigadier in khad 
you can become a general in a week he smiled when asked 
about his meteoric rise

assignment said was an undercover role reporting on suleiman 
layeq afghanistans minister of tribal affairs and a longtime 
member of the peoples democratic party of afghanistan

the kremlin leaders are trying to bring another person who 
could replace najib a nonparty person now the russians are trying 
to save their interests and go back he said

withdrawn half their 115000 soldiers from afghanistan and are

a hushhush countdown continued today 
with the space shuttle atlantis and its fiveman crew facing an 
unfavorable weather forecast for thursdays scheduled liftoff on a 
secret military mission 
air force weather officials said there was a 70 percent 
probability the weather thursday would violate launch criteria 
heavy clouds winds up to 28 mph and possible rain showers were 
predicted 
capt ken warren an air force spokesman reported these 
conditions would be unacceptable and he said the outlook for friday 
was about the same 
the weather was high on the agenda as a 21member team of 
managers and engineers met today to evaluate all aspects of launch 
preparations 
the group was expected to issue a brief statement late in the day 
on the readiness of atlantis and its military crew for a mission 
that reportedly will deploy the 500 million lacrosse satellite to 
spy on eastern europe and the soviet union 
the decisionmaking team is headed by astronaut robert crippen 
nasas deputy director for shuttle operations who has sole 
authority to approve or stop a launch 
the astronauts were up early today to make proficiency training 
flights in t38 jet aircraft they were scheduled later to review 
their operations plan check flight equipment and undergo medical 
examinations 
the national aeronautics and space administration meanwhile 
remained silent on the exact status of the countdown after 
announcing that it had started early monday officials will only say 
that the launch is set for sometime between 632 am and 932 am 
thursday 
sources reported today that the count was on time and that at 8 
am it entered an eighthour builtin hold the hold is 
contingency time in case the launch team has any catching up to do 
other sources have reported the liftoff will occur about 7 am 
if weather and other conditions are favorable 
nasa and the defense department issue periodic reports that the 
countdown is progressing but want to keep its precise status secret 
to cloak the exact time of launch 
there also will be a news blackout through the flight on what the 
astronauts are doing in orbit 
pentagon officials contend the secrecy makes it more difficult 
for the soviet union to monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
but the soviets through its news agency tass have indicated 
they know much about the mission 
tass said sunday the main task of the flight is to release a new 
generation reconnaissance satellite codenamed lacrosse to 
conduct surveillance over the territory of the soviet union with 
the help of updated radar the agency also said the satellite will 
play the role of eye for americas new b2 stealth bomber 
the tass information is similar to that reported in recent weeks 
in this country 
the atlantis commander is navy cmdr robert l gibson the pilot 
is air force lt col guy s gardner and the mission specialists 
are col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross of the air 
force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
crippens team of nasa and contractor experts was assembled for 
the first time before septembers launch of discovery first 
shuttle flight since the challenger disaster of january 1986 
one reason it was established was a breakdown in communications 
that prevented cold weather concerns of some engineers from reaching 
those who made the decision to launch challenger on its illfated 
mission the cold was cited as contributing to the rocket failure 
that destroyed the shuttle and killed its crew of seven 
the crippen team monitors the countdown closely and makes the 
goahead decisions for important milestones such as filling 
atlantis fuel tank scheduled for wednesday night

tornadoshocked victims tried to put their 
shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of 
twisters that killed four people including a couple found with 
their arms wrapped around each other 
at least 17 tornadoes were reported early monday covering 200 
miles of eastern north carolina injuring 151 people and causing 
more than 50 million in damage 
one tornado sent one couple on a flyingmattress ride mark and 
vera cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across the 
street 
i held onto her as tight as i could and the next thing i know 
we are flying said cimerro it was like a ride at the fair 
their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured 
a neighbor 8yearold janet barnes died when a chimney 
collapsed on her bed 
further north in raleigh 12yearold edwin pete fulghum died 
of head and chest injuries 
in rural nash county lee roy alston died with his arms wrapped 
around his fatally injured wife mary apparently in an effort to 
shield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home 
authorities said they had been thrown from the mobile home their 
two children ages 14 and 8 survived 
authorities had put the death toll at six but later corrected it 
to four 
the tornadoes struck in nine counties from wake in the center of 
the state to dare on the atlantic coast authorities said most of 
the damage was in raleigh where tornadoes cut a 10mile swath 
city manager dempsey benton said the storm caused about 50 
million in damage in raleigh the state capital with about 85 
percent of estimates completed about 152 businesses and residential 
buildings were destroyed 301 buildings received major damage and 
644 buildings minor damage he said 
about 500 people were left homeless in raleigh 
damage estimates from other counties were not compiled 
the storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a 
250mile path through the state in 1984 killing 44 people injuring 
more than 800 and leaving 2300 homeless 
gov jim martin asked the federal small business administration 
to declare wake county a disaster area 
the american red cross in wake county got so many offers of 
assistance that the agency ended up turning away some wouldbe 
volunteers organizations rallied to supply everything from free 
legal advice to tips about home repairs 
the twisters destroyed mobile homes damaged churches toppled 
several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses 
and streets 
a k mart store was flattened by the twister and six raleigh 
residents including four juveniles were charged monday with 
looting the store 
more than 6500 homes were left without power but by monday 
night electricity had been restored to all but 1100 customers of 
carolina power amp light said spokesman kyle hampton said 
by nightfall monday most of those whose homes were damaged had 
found somewhere to spend the night either checking into hotels and 
motels or staying with friends and relatives authorities said 
only 17 people from five families spent the night at a raleigh 
middle school the only shelter in wake county said gloria brown of 
the county department of social services 
more than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by 
the storm said helen sibley nurse coordinator for the local red 
cross chapter 
thats why there are not more people in the shelter she 
said people in the city dont think other people care much about 
them but when something like this happens we come together 
farmers also suffered losses in the storms said jim graham 
state commissioner of agriculture several egg production houses 12 
tobacco barns 2000 acres of timber and two hog operations were 
destroyed graham said 
there were also losses of livestock in wake halifax and nash 
counties 
if federal disaster status is appropriate ill press for it 
with all ive got graham said 
the national weather service did not begin issuing tornado 
warnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down in 
western wake county because the twister was too close to radar to 
monitor authorities say 
if you are looking straight up at a storm you cant see much 
said rod gonski a meteorologist with the weather service at raleigh 
durham international airport 
in neighboring virginia one tornado and high wind downed trees 
damaged property and knocked out power in isle of wight brunswick 
and southampton counties early monday but no injuries were reported

the united states and japan announced today they 
will jointly develop a new fighter plane in a project expected to 
cost more than 8 billion japanese foreign minister sosuke uno and 
us ambassador mike mansfield signed an agreement under which japan 
will bear the costs of planning and producing the sophisticated 
plane 
the fighter named the fsx is to be developed by us and 
japanese companies 
japanese officials have said the total cost of developing the 
plane and producing an initial order of 130 and an expected 
followup order both of which will go to japan will be more than 
82 billion 
each fsx plane will cost the japanese government 422 million 
japanese defense officials said 
the two allied countries had clashed on the question of us 
participation in the project japan originally sought to develop 
the jet using only japanese companies and technology while us 
officials pressed for a joint project to trim japans huge trade 
surplus with the united states 
the two sides reportedly agreed in june to allocate between 35 
and 45 percent of the project to us firms 
but defense agency chief kichiro tazawa said today that the 
details of the division of work between the two countries will be 
decided later taking into consideration such factors as economic 
efficiency 
the new fighter will be based on general dynamics f16 
according to the us defense security assistance agency and japans 
defense agencys equipment bureau 
the defense agency named mitsubishi heavy industries of japan the 
prime contractor and general dynamics of the united states as a 
subcontractor two other major japanese firms kawasaki heavy 
industries and fuji heavy industries also were designated as 
subcontractors 
the japanese technologies expected to be used in the plane 
include a sophisticated radar advanced materials and a special wing 
to enhance maneuverability the united states is expected to develop 
a special engine with increased power 
the plane will cost 135 billion to develop in eight years the 
defense agency said it said mass production of the fighter plane is 
expected to begin in 1997 
the new fighter will replace japans f1 planes the only 
fighter developed by japan since world war ii and the f4 
fighterinterceptor planes japan has exempted the united states 
from its ban on the export of military technology on condition that 
usage of japanese military technology would be limited to us 
defense activities

investigations into drug use sexual harassment 
and jobselling by members of the citys community school boards are 
widening and debate is rising over who should control the districts 
mayor edward i koch chancellor richard green and central board 
of education president robert f wagner jr planned to go to albany 
to lobby the legislature today to allow a revamping of the current 
decentralized arrangement 
bronx district attorney paul gentile said monday that evidence 
exists to bring indictments of those accused of demanding money or 
sexual favors in return for jobs he is investigating two of the 
boards 
wagner said the schools inspector general is investigating six 
district boards in manhattan the bronx and brooklyn 
green has suspended district 9s board pending results of 
gentiles investigation into drug use by some members 
at least two members of unidentified local school boards in the 
bronx have offered to cooperate with investigators green said 
green koch and wagner planned to urge lawmakers to bar 
politicians from running for local boards and using them as bases 
for power and patronage they also want to return to the chancellor 
more power over principals of elementary and intermediate schools 
the school system was decentralized 18 years ago putting control 
of the 800 schools for kindergarten through eighth or ninth grade in 
the hands of 32 locally elected district boards the high schools 
remain under jurisdiction of the central board 
since school elections produced very small voter turnouts many 
boards were in many cases taken over by the politically connected 
the sex and money demands were the latest news to rock the school 
system which is still grappling with the arrest of a bronx 
principal on crackbuying charges and the accusation that some local 
school board members were regular cocaine users 
gentile said board members in several districts have been accused 
of demanding sex for jobs or promotions 
in an affidavit a school aide has charged that a former 
president of a school board in the bronx blocked her promotion to a 
paraprofessional job after she refused alleged repeated sexual 
advances 
the official jose m cruz dismissed yolanda picarts charges as 
a womans revenge he said in todays daily news that she was 
upset over not being chosen for the paraprofessional job 
the news also quoted unidentified sources as saying investigators 
are looking into allegations that some board members may have used 
school aides and district office workers as personal chauffeurs and 
handymen 
in a manhattan district a principal allegedly had to dip into 
his pension to pay a board member so he could receive tenure new 
york newsday reported 
gentile said his hotline had gotten 50 or 60 calls about 
wrongdoing in the bronx brooklyn manhattan and queens and that he 
was passing along information to the appropriate prosecutors

britain violated the human rights of 
four men held under antiterrorism laws in northern ireland the 
european court of human rights ruled today 
it said terrence brogan dermot coyle william mcfadden and 
michael tracey are entitled to compensation because they were denied 
speedy judicial hearings after their arrests in late 1984 
through belfast lawyer christopher napier the men said they 
would seek substantial damages and return to the european court if 
there were no amicable settlement 
the four were detained for up to six days and 16 hours and 
released without charge 
the court upheld britains right to arrest suspected terrorists 
without charging them with a specific offense but it said detainees 
must be granted a prompt hearing before a judge 
the men were arrested as part of britains campaign against the 
outlawed irish republican army that seeks to end british rule in 
northern ireland through a campaign of terrorist violence 
roman catholic nationalists in northern ireland welcomed the 
decision but legislators said the court failed to understand 
britains battle against the ira 
the british government said it was studying the decision and 
would respond in parliament at an unspecified date 
we have to consider the human rights of the victims and 
potential victims of terrorism as well as those suspected of 
terrorist involvement said a statement from the home office 
which is responsible for law and order 
danny morrison a spokesman for the iras legal political wing 
sinn fein said once again the british have been found guilty of 
abusing human rights in the north 
merlyn rees a labor party lawmaker and former cabinet minister 
responsible for northern ireland criticized the ruling but he said 
britain will have to accept it because part of our problem is 
convincing the world that we are not a repressive colonial 
government in northern ireland 
neil hamilton a legislator from the governing conservative 
party said the judgment shows no understanding of the terrorist 
threat to britain and the government should reject it out of hand 
under northern irelands antiterrorism law persons simply 
suspected of terrorist activities can be arrested 
but the european court found none of the men was either brought 
promptly before a judicial authority or released promptly 
following his arrest 
the court did not define promptness except to say the human 
rights convention allows only a limited degree of flexibility to 
extend the duration of detention 
britains prevention of terrorism act permits suspected 
terrorists to be detained for 48 hours although the government can 
extend that for another five days 
according to latest figures available at the northern ireland 
office 411 were arrested between january and march this year of 
whom 121 were held beyond 48 hours 
the european court of human rights is part of the 21nation 
council of europe the oldest organization working toward more 
european integration the courts rulings are not legally binding 
but rarely are ignored

president mikhail s gorbachev told the soviet 
parliament today it would gain the right to veto his decisions if it 
adopts his revised proposals to overhaul the soviet political system 
in a speech opening a threeday special session of the supreme 
soviet or parliament gorbachev said the kremlin leadership made 
the veto proposal among 88 changes it recommended in response to 
250000 public comments on the new election law and constitutional 
amendments put before the body today 
two high republic officials from the baltics however registered 
dissatisfaction with elements of the reform program when addressing 
the plenum signalling the start of a genuine debate in the chamber 
where ritual ascent is the norm 
the original drafts published just five weeks ago sparked 
widespread criticism that the changes would concentrate too much 
power in the presidency in a nation with a history of dictatorship 
in a reference to the outcry gorbachev acknowledged it is 
obvious that some of the provisions of the bills were not formulated 
precisely enough and caused quite a few critical remarks in the 
course of the discussions 
reading today from a new draft gorbachev said the supreme soviet 
has the right to veto decrees of the presidium instructions of 
the president of the supreme soviet and the leadership would be 
required to account to the legislature at least once a year 
currently directives from the president are made in the name of 
the presidium and are subject to confirmation at the next full 
session of the supreme soviet but practically there are no 
challenges the supreme soviet had its first nonunanimous vote in 
memory last month 
gorbachev promised that other changes also would preserve the 
soviet unions traditional collective style of leadership under 
that style the highest government body the presidium of the 
supreme soviet and the highest party body the politburo are 
collective bodies the head of the presidium is the president 
traditionally a ceremonial role 
it was not immediately clear whether gorbachev was giving up his 
original proposal to strengthen the presidents role by giving him 
chairmanship of the defense council and responsibility for 
overseeing foreign policy 
the latest draft of the proposed changes also responded to 
complaints from small republics including estonia latvia and 
georgia by increasing the republics representation in one of the 
houses of the bicameral parliament 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov asked that the reform package 
be postponed to consider objections by his parliament including one 
to the possibility of an individual occupying several seats in the 
new congress of peoples deputies 
another baltic president vitautas astrauskas of lithuania 
called for a convention to write a new constitution that would give 
the central government authority to decide issues of national scope 
and reserve all other matters for the republics 
but he welcomed gorbachevs announced changes and accepted the 
presidents proposal to put off issues of the rights of republics 
until later 
gorbachev proposed creating a special commission to settle the 
question of division of power between the 15 soviet republics and 
the central government and suggested the deputies limit this session 
to overhauling the government structure 
he said the complex questions of the rights of the republics and 
the powers of local legislative bodies known as soviets or 
councils could be left for later 
we have just embarked on reform he said in this 
revolutionary period we are blowing up the old structure the 
first step in reconstruction is the overhaul now before the 
parliament he said 
gorbachev rejected complaints that the principle of one man one 
vote is violated by a plan to let organizations such as the 
communist party and trade unions elect onethird of the deputies in 
a new congress of peoples deputies 
he said the reform clearly states that legislative elections can 
have multiple candidates but added that because numerous candidates 
could be proposed they must face preliminary discussion before 
their local nominating commissions it was not known whether the 
commissions could reject specific candidates 
the soviet leader also hinted at promised future reforms they 
include a rewrite of the preamble of the soviet constitution 
including the definition of socialist property 
the 1500member legislative body met in special session one day 
after the communist partys policymaking central committee endorsed 
the changes a move that in the past would have paved the way for 
unanimous approval by the parliament

a good samaritan who shot two muggers asked 
for leniency on a 1987 drug conviction but a judge who imposed a 
stiff sentence said he did not want to send a message to the public 
that it is ok to go and kill people 
state supreme court justice joseph slavin sentenced clovis fearon 
to 1 to 4 years in prison only slightly less than the maximum 
two to sixyear sentence he could have received 
if hes such a fine person why did he have a brazilianmade 
saturday night special slavin said at the sentencing monday 
you said you want to be an honest citizen well you can be an 
honest citizen when you get out of jail 
fearon who came to new york from jamaica five years ago had 
pleaded guilty in february 1987 to felony charges for directing two 
undercover police officers to a drug dealer who sold them two vials 
of crack 
a fugitive since march 1987 who had been living under an assumed 
name fearons identity was revealed nov 2 when he came to the 
rescue of a woman being robbed on the street outside his home he 
killed one man and wounded another using an unregistered handgun 
i knew that getting involved could lead to my exposure 
fearon said at his sentencing i did not want to get involved but 
i knew i had to do something to help 
slavin last year had promised fearon a sentence of one day in 
jail and five years probation on the drug conviction but had warned 
him if he did not appear for sentencing he would impose a two to 
sixyear prison term 
fearon who read from a written statement told the judge monday 
that the reason he did not come to his sentencing was that an 
immigration lawyer had told him that he could be deported to jamaica 
i was afraid i did not want to go back to jamaica because i 
love america i know it is the land of opportunity fearon said 
he said that after he became a fugitive he made a vow to himself 
to be a lawabiding citizen and had worked as many as three jobs at 
a time to support a wife and two children in jamaica 
slavin said he reduced the sentence for his quote 
heroism but the judge chided fearon for going underground and 
changing his name and for owning the unlicensed gun which he used to 
shoot the two muggers 
fearon must serve the minimum of 1 years before being eligible 
for parole 
the mugging victim gertrude george was not in court on monday 
but had sent slavin a letter urging him to be lenient he had also 
received 50 other letters of support and petitions signed by people 
who lived in fearons neighborhood of east flatbush

the supreme court ruled today that an ohio 
court erroneously upheld the rape robbery and assault convictions 
of a man whose courtappointed lawyer withdrew from the case 
in an 81 decision the high court said the ohio court of appeals 
should not have decided on steven anthony pensons appeal of rape 
robbery and assault convictions without first appointing a new 
attorney to handle the case 
the need for forceful advocacy does not come to an abrupt halt 
as the legal proceeding moves from the trial to appellate stage 
justice john paul stevens wrote for the court which ordered further 
hearings on the case 
stevens said the ohio tribunal erred by failing to appoint new 
counsel to represent petitioner after determining that pensons 
case raised several possible legal issues for appellate review 
pensons original courtappointed lawyer was allowed to withdraw 
from the appeal after filing a statement that he found no legal 
errors by the trial judge that required reversal of the convictions 
the appeals court then denied pensons request for a new lawyer 
but later reviewed the trial record and found that the defendant had 
several arguable claims 
the court reversed one of the three convictions stemming from 
pensons involvement with two other men in the aug 4 1984 
breakin of a montgomery county ohio home 
but it ultimately concluded that penson suffered no prejudice 
from his courtappointed lawyers failure to give a more 
conscientious examination of the record and upheld the remaining 
two convictions 
penson who is serving an 18to28year sentence was one of 
three men convicted of breaking into the home and sexually 
assaulting a man and two women who were also robbed 
stevens said the ohio court violated standards set by the high 
court in a 1967 opinion for judging the effectiveness of 
courtappointed lawyers handling appeals 
both stages of the prosecution although perhaps involving 
unique legal skills require careful advocacy to ensure that rights 
are not foregone and that substantial legal and factual arguments 
are not inadvertently passed over stevens wrote in an opinion 
that drew a dissent from chief justice william rehnquist 
it bears emphasis that the right to be represented by counsel 
is among the most fundamental rights stevens wrote 
we have long recognized that lawyers in criminal courts are 
necessities not luxuries the courts majority said quoting 
from its landmark 1963 decision in gideon v wainwright that 
mandated courtappointed lawyers for indigent defendants 
but rehnquist called the decision a futile monument to the 
courts effort to guarantee to the indigent appellant what no court 
can guarantee him exactly the same sort of legal services that 
would be provided suitably by retained private counsel 
rehnquist said the ohio courts review of the trial record 
without assistance of pensons lawyer resulted in the proper finding 
that the defendants rights were not prejudiced 
but the courts majority rejected this view saying that the ohio 
tribunal could not justify its refusal to appoint a new lawyer on 
the ground there was no merit to pensons appeal 
finding harmless error or a lack of prejudice in cases such 
as this however would leave criminal appealants without any 
protections under the 1967 decision stevens wrote 
the case is penson v ohio 876116

a man on trial for murder in the beating of his 
illegally adopted daughter once whacked the sleeping 6yearold in 
the face out of the clear blue sky a witness testified 
the witness alleged drug dealer charles scannapieco on monday 
became the first person to testify that he actually saw joel 
steinberg a nowdisbarred lawyer strike lisa steinberg 
scannapieco said steinberg hit the girl hard enough to bring 
tears and for no apparent reason 
meanwhile steinberg faces a 3 million lawsuit filed by his 
former livein lover hedda nussbaum the suit filed in state court 
monday alleges steinberg assaulted and tortured her for most of the 
11 years they lived together 
nussbaum also charged that he used humiliation brainwashing 
drugs and the withholding of food to teach her that she was a 
worthless person who could only be saved through his wisdom and 
special powers 
nussbaum is expected to testify against steinberg in the murder 
trial 
scannapieco who has been indicted on narcotics charges had 
hired steinberg to represent him scannapieco said he saw steinberg 
strike lisa on oct 23 1987 as steinberg drove them to 
scannapiecos home in lake katrine in upstate new york 
more than 20 witnesses have testified against steinberg so far 
but scannapieco is the first to report having seen steinberg strike 
the girl 
right after she fell asleep scannapieco said right out of 
the clear blue sky mr steinberg took his hand and went 
demonstrating the blow smash 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax struck the word 
smash from the record at the request of steinbergs lawyer ira 
london 
demonstrating the blow scannapieco slammed the back of his hand 
against the judges bench the judge steinberg and the jurors 
seemed startled steinberg smiled and shook his head as if in 
disbelief at scannapiecos dramatic gesture 
scannapieco said the slap on the right side of lisas face was 
pretty forceful enough to bring tears to your eyes 
she woke up and looked at steinberg who told her to stop 
staring at him and keep blinking and smiling keep blinking and 
smiling thats what she was told to do scannapieco said he 
said steinberg told lisa this five or six times 
steinberg did not seem angry scannapieco said 
scannapieco said steinberg told him he hit the child because she 
sometimes slowed her heart and breathing putting herself into a 
near coma he quoted steinberg as saying it was a medical condition 
that got so serious one time that he had to put her in the 
hospital 
lisa was removed unconscious from steinbergs greenwich village 
apartment on nov 2 1987 and died of head injuries three days 
later 
steinberg has denied hitting the child he has said she fell 
unconscious after choking on food and that he caused bruises on her 
chest and back while trying to revive her 
a report in mondays new york newsday quoted court sources as 
saying that in the month before lisas death steinberg freebased 
cocaine nightly from a kilogram that had been left with him for 
safekeeping by a client

the supreme court ruled today that police do 
not violate the rights of criminal defendants when through 
negligence they fail to preserve vital evidence or to conduct 
stateoftheart laboratory tests 
the justices voting 63 reinstated the conviction of an arizona 
man in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10yearold boy 
a lower court had thrown out the conviction and 10year prison 
sentence of larry youngblood because police failed to preserve 
properly semen samples from the childs body and clothing 
but today chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for 
the high court said the situation here is no different than a 
prosecution for drunk driving that rests on police observation 
alone 
the defendant is free to argue that a breathalyzer test 
might have been exculpatory he said but the police do not have 
a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests 
rehnquist said that as long as the failure to conduct the tests 
was a result of police negligence and not bad faith the rights of 
the defendant are not violated 
unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of 
the police failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not 
constitute a denial of due process of law rehnquist said 
in another decision the justices ruled that an ohio court 
erroneously upheld the rape robbery and assault convictions of a 
man whose courtappointed lawyer withdrew from the case 
voting 81 the high court said the ohio court of appeals should 
not have decided on steven anthony pensons appeal of rape robbery 
and assault convictions without first appointing a new attorney to 
handle the case 
in the evidence case youngblood was convicted of kidnaping his 
victim on oct 29 1983 from a carnival in the tucson area police 
said the boy was driven to a house raped four times during a 
90minute ordeal and then released 
the boy identified youngblood as his attacker from photographs 
shown to him by police youngblood was convicted of child molesting 
sexual assault and kidnaping 
laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also 
in clothing he was wearing 
it was not until a year later that the semen was tested to 
determine blood typing of the assailant but no blood group 
substances were found 
the semen sample taken from the boys body was refrigerated the 
clothing which might have contained a larger quantity of semen was 
not 
youngblood was determined to be what is known as a secretor with 
blood type a that means that his blood group could be determined 
from his semen 
the absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the 
victim suggested that the boys attacker either was a nonsecretor 
or that the samples were too small to determine blood type 
there also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to 
determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples 
an arizona appeals court threw out youngbloods conviction on 
grounds that had stateoftheart tests been performed and had the 
best technology been used to preserve the evidence youngblood might 
have been found innocent 
dissenting today were justices harry a blackmun william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall 
blackmun writing for all three said an understanding of due 
process demonstrates that the evidence which was allowed to 
deteriorate was constitutionally material and that its absence 
significantly prejudiced youngblood 
the case is arizona vs youngblood 861904

the recent murders of three drifters in balboa 
park have been linked to a single killer and police are urging male 
transients and homosexuals to avoid the park at night 
we are worried that there is someone out there who may kill 
again sgt hank olias said monday 
we know that two of the three victims were transients and at 
least two were homosexual he said 
the type of gun used is the common link among the slayings said 
police spokesman dave cohen who declined to elaborate each victim 
died of multiple gunshot wounds in the separate shootings over the 
past two weeks 
single men by themselves in the park after dark should use 
extreme care deputy police chief mike rice said there is 
someone out there who has already killed three of them 
police assigned extra patrol units to the park monday night to 
increase surveillance and warn park users of the danger 
up to several hundred drifters are estimated to seek shelter at 
night in the sprawling park which is less than one mile north of 
downtown san diego 
it fluctuates said department spokesman bill robinson no 
one has been able to conduct a tally but its been as high as in 
the hundreds because many hide in the canyons 
homicide detectives refused to discuss evidence related to the 
killings saying through robinson only that their investigation has 
conclusively linked three recent homicides in balboa park 
right now theyre playing it pretty close to the vest because 
it is a new series that weve just been able to put together 
robinson said 
the series began with the nov 19 discovery of the body of 
transient david siino 31 olias said he was staying at a downtown 
hotel and had been in the san diego area for the past eight months 
the body of edward hope 60 was found friday hope who had been 
dead for three to five days is believed to have arrived from nevada 
days before his death olias said 
the most recent victim was identified as brian poole 36 a 
transient from torrington conn whose body was found saturday in a 
park bathroom he apparently had been living out of his car which 
was parked nearby olias said 
none of the victims apparently had local jobs or knew either of 
the others said olias who emphasized that it isnt known whether 
the killer is targeting gay men transients or both 
the restroom where poole was killed has a longstanding reputation 
as a meeting place for homosexuals said olais who noted its also 
in an area of the park where a sharp rise in assaults and burglaries 
last month prompted police to temporarily increase patrols 
police blamed most of the earlier crime wave on a band of illegal 
aliens but lt phil jarvis said he doesnt think the recent 
killings are related 
based on what we know we dont think we have seen the same 
person jarvis said there is no evidence in the recent 
shootings of robbery

the nuclear regulatory commission has ordered 
the nations 110 nuclear plants to locate and test possibly 
counterfeit and faulty circuit breakers installed in safety systems 
an nrc spokesman confirmed today 
spokesman frank ingram said a nov 22 bulletin issued by the 
commission found that recent inspections indicate a potential 
safety concern regarding electrical equipment supplied to nuclear 
power plants 
however a counterfeit or faulty breaker has never been blamed 
for any kind of incident at a nuclear plant ingram said 
the order for inspections which must be carried out by march 1 
followed an nrc investigation that found four southern california 
companies had allegedly sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants 
pacific gas amp electric reported in july that it had found 30 
counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the diablo canyon nuclear 
plant near san luis obispo 
southern california edison co found in the same month that it 
had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its san onofre 
plant 55 miles south of los angeles 
the nrc said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary 
to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be 
operated without undue risk to the public health and safety 
the nrc has found numerous failures of certain types of 
circuit breakers during preliminary commissionsupervised tests the 
bulletin said 
if a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed 
and it cannot be immediately tested the utility must submit an 
analysis justifying continued operation the bulletin said 
the los angeles times reported today that the inspection plan was 
criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by underwriters 
laboratory a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit 
breakers 
the test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the 
tested circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended 
purpose the laboratory said 
the nrc responded by saying that it considers the test program 
to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and 
characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety 
the nrc has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be 
counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components 
pgampe spokesman dick davin said the utility was still evaluating 
the order and how it would affect the diablo canyon nuclear plant 
southern california edison co spokesman dave barron said the san 
onofre plant had not yet received the order but that the utility 
would comply

a federal judge today found a japanese man 
linked to a terrorist group guilty of transporting bombs on the new 
jersey turnpike after the man agreed to the governments description 
of the incident 
in a surprise announcement monday defense attorneys william 
kunstler and ronald kuby said they would accept the governments 
claims about yu kikumura who has been linked to the japanese red 
army on the condition that kikumura can maintain his right to 
appeal pretrial rulings in the case 
federal prosecutors said today in court they would accept the 
condition 
although kikumura admitted to the governments account of his 
actions if the pretrial rulings which bear on the admissibility 
of evidence against him are overturned his conviction could be 
thrown out 
us district judge alfred j lechner jr asked kikumura a series 
of questions to make sure he understood what he was doing in a 
procedure similar to that used in guilty pleas in essence kikumura 
agreed to the charges and waived his right to a jury trial 
there is no contest and there is no alternative lechner 
said i find the defendant yu kikumura guilty of each count of the 
indictment 
outside the courthouse us attorney samuel a alito jr said 
kikumura had come to this country to kill people 
this man is an international terrorist who sneakd into the 
united states using a skillfully forged passpport alito said 
if he had not been stopped there would have been some people 
killed and maimed he said 
kunstler later told reporters that the government had wanted to 
create a show trial and that the case was indefensible but 
because evidence was illegally seized he predicted the conviction 
would be overturned 
if you take away the constitutional rights of yu kikumura you 
can take away the rights of anybody said ronald kuby another 
defense attorney 
the defense proposed its deal monday before jury selection began 
and moments after it lost an argument to have the indictment 
dismissed 
last month lechner denied a motion to disqualify evidence 
namely the three homemade bombs made of fire extinguisher 
canisters explosives paraphernalia and numerous personal items 
found in kikumuras car when he was arrested at a rest stop april 12 
in ridgefield less than five miles east of new york city 
on monday kuby and kunstler asked lechner to dismiss the 
indictment after prosecutors disclosed that kikumuras phone calls 
with defense attorneys were recorded at the metropolitan 
correctional center in new york city 
all inmates calls at the institution are recorded as a matter of 
course although attorneyclient calls are not supposed to be 
listened to previously prosecutors had said the lawyer calls were 
not recorded 
lechner found that the defense had not shown that any evidence 
was tainted or that the government benefited from the taping 
kunstler said his client would stipulate to the charges in 
the indictment an acknowledgement but not a formal guilty plea 
as long as kikumura could be allowed to appeal lechners ruling that 
the evidence was legally seized and other issues 
we want to save the courts time we want to save the 
taxpayers money kunstler said adding that if the government 
insisted on bringing the case before a jury it would cause 
essentially a show trial where we will be mute 
us attorney samuel a alito jr angrily objected to kunstlers 
raising plea negotiations in public calling it unprecedented 
lechner told both sides to discuss the matter and report back 
today he also told the 130 potential jurors to return today 
federal authorities have said kikumura 36 may be linked to the 
japanese red army a terrorist organization court documents showed 
he had traveled about 7000 miles throughout the northeast after 
arriving in the united states fie weeks before his arrest 
in testimony monday fbi agents said more than 25 agents in 
cities nationwide were involved in the investigation people from 
four countries were on the governments witness list said defense 
cocounsel ronald kuby 
kuby said there were three main issues to present to an appellate 
court contentions that the stop and search of kikumuras car was 
illegal and hence the evidence inadmissible that the charges are 
repetitive because they carry 90 years in prison terms and that the 
government may have had access to privileged attorneyclient 
conversations through the corrections center phone recordings

the us economy held back by the summer 
drought expanded at a moderate 26 percent annual rate in the 
julyseptember quarter the government said today 
the commerce department said the performance of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of economic health slowed in 
the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 32 percent 
during the first six months of the year 
it was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986 when 
the economy grew at a sluggish 14 percent rate 
the report however represents an upward revision from a 
preliminary estimate last month which pegged growth at 22 percent 
the department attributed the revision to a higherthanexpected 
rise in personal consumption expenditures which account for nearly 
twothirds of economic activity they rose at an annual rate of 4 
percent in the third quarter compared with an earlier estimate of 
35 percent 
also nonfarm business inventories grew faster than originally 
thought however this could be a source of weakness in the future 
if consumer demand slackens and manufacturers have to cut production 
as the inventories are sold off 
a price index tied to the gnp also proved more brisk than was 
first estimated the index which reflects changing consumption 
patterns as well as prices rose at an annual rate of 47 percent 
up from the first estimate of 44 percent the second quarter soared 
at an even faster 55 percent the highest in nearly six years 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the latest 
report does not change the basic economic picture of moderate 
growth and steady inflation 
inflation remains at about the second quarter rate and after 
adjusting for the effects of the drought the economy continues to 
grow at its longterm average pace which is 2 to 3 percent he 
said 
however the revisions to the gnp were about in line with 
economists expectations and fit in with anticipation in the market 
that the federal reserve board will soon move to curb inflation by 
dampening growth with higher interest rates 
major banks on monday raised their prime lending rate to 105 
percent the highest level since mid1985 economists expect a new 
round of increases as the fed tries to restrain growth to a 
noninflationary pace of 2 percent to 25 percent 
the fed pushed up interest rates steadily from late march through 
early august for a time it appeared the medicine was taking hold 
a number of statistical reports showed slower growth in august and 
september 
government numbers released over the last three weeks however 
portray robust growth in october the first month of the fourth 
quarter 
its amazing how strong the momentum is now said david 
jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york well be starting the seventh 
year of an economic expansion and the normal peacetime expansion 
lasts only three years 
he predicts growth will accelerate to an annual rate of about 35 
percent in the final three months of 1988 even with the aftershocks 
from the drought 
the commerce department said that without the drought third 
quarter growth would have been a strong 32 percent and second 
quarter growth would have been a brisk 39 percent rather than 30 
percent the effect of the drought in the fourth quarter is 
estimated to be about double the drag in the third quarter 
the two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year 
exports and business investment played less of role in the third 
quarter 
exports and imports both grew at an annual rate of 116 percent 
because imports were growing from a larger base however the 
nations inflationadjusted trade deficit as measured by the gnp 
worsened slightly for the first time in a year 
business investment grew at an annual rate of 48 percent in the 
third quarter down from 150 percent in the second quarter 
james annable an economist with first national bank of chicago 
predicted that exports and investment spending will rebound in part 
because of the continued fall of the dollar which hit a 40year low 
last week against the japanese yen 
a lower dollar makes american goods cheaper on overseas markets 
spurring export sales the higher sales in turn stimulate spending 
by manufacturers to increase productive capacity 
however stronger growth brings with it the danger of higher 
prices as the economy strains to meet demand already factories are 
using more of their production capacity 84 percent than at any 
time in more than eight years with unemployment at a 14year low of 
53 percent businesses are offering higher wages to attract workers 
its likely the federal reserve will respond by pushing up 
interest rates and tightening credit banks are already 
anticipating this process by raising their prime rate jones said 
higher interest rates discourage spending by both consumers and 
businesses thus slowing economic expansion 
what the fed is trying to do is engineer a moderation of growth 
to a somewhat less inflationary pace its a very delicate balancing 
act the tightening so far just wasnt enough to do the job jones 
said 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual rate of 401 trillion 
in an accompanying report the commerce department said aftertax 
corporate profits rose a slight 02 percent in the third quarter 
after soaring 89 percent in the second quarter the julyseptember 
gain was the lowest since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987

the judge in oliver l norths irancontra case 
today refused to bar prosecutors from closed hearings set to begin 
this week on deleting sensitive government secrets from documents to 
be used as evidence 
us district judge gerhard a gesell refused to give lawyers for 
the former national security council aide permission to file a 
motion to bar independent counsel lawrence e walsh from the 
hearing which is set to begin wednesday 
gesell said in a brief order that barring prosecutors would 
alter the purpose of the hearing and would result in further and 
wholly unnecessary delay 
defense lawyers gave no reason for their request filed monday 
if they had been granted permission to file the motion they would 
likely have argued that prosecutors would get an unfair preview of 
their strategy if allowed to attend the hearing 
north is charged with conspiring to divert millions of dollars in 
profits from the reagan administrations secret weapons deals with 
iran to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
the hearings were scheduled by gesell to consider defense 
objections to the deletion of sensitive material from classified 
documents that walsh wants to use as evidence against north 
gesell has directed north to come to the hearing prepared to say 
why the material is relevant to his defense and should not be 
deleted 
the references walsh wants to delete include names of foreign 
countries and officials as well as us intelligence agents 
operating abroad the government has consented to walshs use of the 
350 documents as exhibits in a public trial provided the sensitive 
references are deleted 
also on monday north replied to walshs request that gesell bar 
the defense from using any of 40000 pages of classified documents 
it has proposed as trial exhibits 
walsh contends that north listed many of the documents in his 
nov 14 notice simply to provoke dismissal of the charges against 
him by threatening to disclose some of the nations bestkept 
secrets 
norths lawyers countered that walsh is making a frontal 
assault on defendant norths fundamental fifth and sixth amendment 
right to present a defense 
no date has been set for norths trial the first of four ordered 
by gesell for the former presidential aide and his three 
codefendants former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen

rushed production schedules pressured 
workers inspecting parts for the b1 bomber and some flawed parts 
may have been used in building the aircraft some rockwell 
international plant workers say 
a copyright report monday by wbnstv quoted workers as saying 
substandard parts disappeared after being rejected by plant 
inspectors the employees said they believe those parts subsequently 
were used in building the bombers to meet production schedules 
us sen john glenn dohio and rep john kasich rohio 
called for inquiries as a result of the news report 
fred hoffman a spokesman for the pentagon said today the 
defense department and air force were aware of the tv report but had 
no reason to suspect faulty parts had been used in the bomber 
the air force does not have any evidence at this time which 
corroborates the assertions by former rockwell employees that 
substandard parts were used in the construction of b1s hoffman 
said 
however the air force is investigating or is looking into 
these allegations 
four b1b bombers have crashed in the four years since the 
aircraft began flying as the nations first new longrange bomber in 
more than 25 years including three crashes in the past 14 months 
and two in the past three weeks 
tod sumner identified as a b1 inspection manager said he was 
told that if he did not reduce the number of finished parts that 
were stored for inspection he would be fired 
wbns said sumner and larry greene identfied as a former quality 
inspector with rockwell worked over the fourth of july weekend in 
1986 to inspect 1400 parts after they were threatened with 
dismissal the men were later suspended for 17 days after the air 
force questioned the quality of inspections conducted in so short a 
time the station said 
rockwell wanted a scapegoat fall guys so they could say 
quality problems were taken care of and lets go on greene said 
greene and sumner met with an attorney and planned to sue the 
company if they were fired wbns said they ultimately were assigned 
to less sensitive jobs 
mike mathews a spokesman for north american aircraft the 
rockwell unit that operated the columbus plant said rockwell had 
investigated similar claims by the two workers previously and found 
no bad parts had been used 
we believe similar allegations were made involving greene and 
sumner in 1985 at which time they were thoroughly investigated and 
no defective parts were found to have been delivered to the air 
force mathews said 
mathews said the company would have to examine the claims in the 
wbns report before commenting on them 
the newscast also reported that other workers said the air force 
was more interested in verifying paperwork than in conducting 
onsite parts inspections they also said workers and management 
knew in advance when inspections would be conducted 
last month the general accounting office congress watchdog 
agency released a study saying b1bs at dyess air force base in 
west texas were unable to fly 47 percent to 66 percent of the time 
because they undergo maintenance a significant portion of the 
time 
the columbus plant manufactured the housing for the b1s jet 
engines the forward intermediate fuselage of the plane and what 
mathews described as a primary structural element of the 
supersonic aircraft 
rockwell has ended operations at the plant and has delivered the 
last b1 components to its palmdale calif assembly plant mathews 
said

the nuclear regulatory commission said tuesday 
it has ordered operators of all commercial nuclear power plants to 
check their safety systems for counterfeit and possibly faulty 
circuit breakers 
spokesman frank ingram said the order issued nov 22 to the 110 
plants noted that recent inspections indicate a potential safety 
concern but he said there have been no instances where a 
counterfeit or faulty breaker was blamed for an accident of any kind 
at a nuclear plant 
the order for inspections which must be carried out by march 1 
followed an nrc investigation into allegations that four southern 
california firms had sold counterfeit breakers to nuclear plants 
pacific gas amp electric reported in july that it had found 30 
counterfeit breakers in its inventory at the diablo canyon nuclear 
plant near san luis obispo 
southern california edison co found in the same month that it 
had bought 16 potentially counterfeit breakers for its san onofre 
plant 55 miles south of los angeles 
the nrc said in the bulletin that the inspections are necessary 
to provide reasonable assurance that nuclear power plants can be 
operated without undue risk to the public health and safety 
the nrc has found numerous failures of certain types of 
circuit breakers during preliminary commissionsupervised tests the 
bulletin said 
if a potentially counterfeit breaker is found already installed 
and it cannot be immediately tested the utility must submit an 
analysis justifying continued operation the bulletin said 
the los angeles times reported that the inspection plan was 
criticized in a memorandum attached to the bulletin by underwriters 
laboratory a nonprofit testing agency that certifies circuit 
breakers 
the test program is not adequate to provide assurance that the 
tested circuit breakers would be suitable for their intended 
purpose the laboratory said 
the nrc responded by saying that it considers the test program 
to provide a reasonable assurance of performance requirements and 
characteristics most important to ensuring reactor safety 
the nrc has told utilities that more than 50 companies may be 
counterfeiting circuit breakers and other electrical components

the pilot of a wrecked delta jetliner told 
federal officials looking into last summers crash that his crews 
flight preparations were adequate although they may have bent some 
of the rules 
delta capt larry davis 48 was among the first witnesses to 
testify in the fourday public hearing before national 
transportation safety board investigators which began today at an 
irving hotel and drew some 200 people 
the delta air lines boeing 727 crashed aug 31 on takeoff from 
dallasfort worth international airport killing 14 people 
ninetyfour people survived 
davis said the plane had no apparent problems although a fuel 
gauge didnt work but the captain said he and his crew followed 
written procedures to compensate for the faulty gauge 
the flight was normal no problem at all to dallasfort worth 
airport from jackson miss davis said the plane was bound for 
salt lake city 
ntsb board of inquiry technical panelist jeff gorney an 
aerospace engineer questioned davis handling of preflight 
preparations including his failure to initiate required checklists 
and failure to call out the completion of every checklist 
gorney also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit 
when the plane was waiting to take off 
davis admitted the seeming deviations from written regulations 
but he still stressed that he thought he and the crew had complied 
with airline instructions 
for instance the delta veteran of 23 years said he had used hand 
signals instead of calling out completion of each checklist and made 
a required takeoff briefing at the gate instead of doing it as the 
plane was on the runway 
i like to get as much done as possible before we get into the 
position of getting rushed said davis 
he admitted that allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit was 
against a policy declaring that the cockpit be a sterile area 
once it has left the gate but he noted that the plane was waiting 
in a line of traffic moving up a space at a time 
davis was questioned for 63 minutes before ntsb officials 
declared a break he was told he would be asked to recount what he 
had done the previous day how he had slept the night before the 
crash and details of events up to the time of the crash 
thirteen people died as the plane split open and the fuselage 
exploded in flames just off a runway one man died later of injuries 
suffered as he tried to make his way back onto the burning plane in 
an unsuccessful attempt to save his trapped wife in addition to 
davis the copilot and flight engineer survived and were expected 
to testify 
jim burnett chairman of the board of inquiry stressed in his 
opening statements that no conclusions are to be made by the panel 
during its hearing but that officials were only gathering 
information for a final report to be released in six months 
but officials of the pilots union said they believe 
investigators may have decided on the first day of their 
investigation that the crew was to blame 
if you do a quick and dirty investigation the verdict is going 
to be quick and dirty pilot error jim gray delta spokesman for 
the air line pilots association said monday at a news conference 
the union argues the plane may have had a malfunction called a 
splitflap configuration in which the wing flaps stick in 
opposing positions one extended one retracted robbing the plane 
of power and lift 
gray said judging by the list of witnesses and exhibits the ntsb 
scheduled for the hearing it appeared as though the federal board 
already has pinpointed a cause and was looking at such matters as 
deltas flight safety program 
ntsb spokesman mike benson responded that the pilots association 
and other involved parties had all agreed to the witness list two 
weeks ago

soldiers in army trucks rolled into the paris region 
tuesday to help transport hundreds of thousands of suburban 
commuters stranded by a transit strike the government called union 
guerrilla warfare 
the strike called by the communistled general confederation of 
labor paralyzed two of four lines on the regional express network 
and was spreading to city subway and bus services 
on monday night the french government ordered more than 350 
military trucks and 1000 soldiers to supplement private companies 
called in to move passengers 
the military contingent from dijon and other areas was expected 
to be in operation for morning rush hour wednesday with 250 trucks 
at the suburban terminals of the affected lines according to 
prefect olivier philip governor of the ile de france region 
it was expected to take up to 48 hours for all 365 military 
vehicles to be operational 
deterioration of public services forces the government to 
assume its responsibilities president francois mitterrand said 
that is what the government has done and done well notably in 
calling in the army 
the transit strike is one of a string of work stoppages plaguing 
france for more than a month public sector employees ranging from 
postal workers to nurses ambulance drivers and even funeral parlor 
employees have been striking sporadically for increased wages and 
other benefits 
socialist premier michel rocard in power for six months has 
remained firm in the face of demands continuing the tight spending 
policies in force since 1983 
transport minister michel delebarre ordered strikers wages 
suspended and punishment of those engaged in what he said were 
illegal acts 
he said some strikers blocked buses in their terminals flattened 
tires and sabotaged engines 
this amounted to a sort of union guerrilla warfare of 
harassment in which hundreds of thousands of users were being 
taken hostage the minister said 
blocked terminals maintenance depots and lack of material were 
forcing a reduction in city bus and metro service with buses 
running at about 60 percent capacity at rush hour tuesday and one 
metro line shut down 
the transit authority decided over the weekend to close down the 
two suburban train lines starting monday saying safety could no 
longer be assured because of the strikers whose strength is 
concentrated in the train maintenance forces 
henri krasucki secretarygeneral of the labor federation 
denounced what he called government tactics of repression 
sanctions and intimidation which he said will only increase the 
fighting spirit of the strikers 
workers with an average monthly salary of about 1100 are 
demanding a 170 monthly increase plus improved safety measures the 
transit authority most recently proposed increases of about 25 plus 
bonuses ranging from about 17 to 100 
opposition politicians have criticized rocard saying he has 
failed to define a policy to deal with public sector grievances 
mitterrand reelected to a sevenyear term in may had made social 
peace a main campaign pledge 
the strike action fanned by the labor federation is widely 
regarded as a communist party effort to undermine the government and 
strengthen its own hand for municipal elections in march party 
officials deny they are using social discontent for political 
benefit and krasucki said the idea was completely stupid 
job grievances have affected many sectors this fall 
striking postal workers left paris without mail service for three 
weeks earlier this month and mail strikes continue in lyon amiens 
and clermontferrand 
marseille has been hit with strikes by train and bus drivers and 
social security workers who are refusing to work in several 
provincial cities 
other job actions are being carried out at nuclear plants in 
paris pharmacies and at the louvre museum where guards protesting a 
change in work hours have been off the job for more than a week

defense secretary frank c carlucci next 
week will visit four arab states that have provided limited support 
for american forces in the persian gulf us officials say 
a stop aboard us warships in the gulf also is on the itinerary 
for what was expected to be carluccis last tour before the reagan 
administration leaves office in january said the officials who 
asked not to be identified 
the defense department said carlucci would discuss a variety of 
regional issues with officials in oman bahrain saudi arabia and 
kuwait these presumably would include the scaling back of us 
forces following the iraqiran ceasefire 
carlucci is including the gulf on a 10day trip that begins with 
defense meetings in paris and at nato headquarters in brussels 
gulfbased sources insisting on anonymity said carluccis visit 
was primarily in response to an invitation from omans defense 
minister mutassim bin hamoud busaidi the other stops were added 
for diplomatic reasons they said 
all four arab states though nominally neutral in the iraqiran 
war have made facilities of one kind or another available to us 
forces since mid1987 when the escalating conflict prompted a major 
buildup of american and other foreign naval units in the gulf 
despite the aug 20 ceasefire in effect ending eight years of 
iraqiran hostilities 11 kuwaitowned oil tankers reflagged by the 
united states last year for protection still sail under the stars 
and stripes 
the sources said carluccis acceptance of the omani invitation 
reflected us interest in nurturing a relationship that gained 
strength during the war yet remains more secretive than us ties 
with any other gulf arab state 
the omanis permit us warships to refuel at a naval depot on the 
arabian sea they have served three times in the past 15 months as 
diplomatic gobetweens for the repatriation of iranians captured or 
rescued at sea by us forces 
the omanis who share control of the strait of hormuz the 
strategic gateway to the gulf with iran have longstanding military 
ties with britain however they also are the only gulf state to 
participate in annual bright star military maneuvers with the 
united states egypt somalia and sudan 
pentagon officials say the united states will reduce its fleet if 
the iraqiran truce continues to hold but have given no timetable 
already trimmed by two ships from 27 to 25 it remains the 
largest of six foreign navies in the region 
the gulfbased squadron of 15 returned to full strength sunday 
when the amphibious assault ship uss raleigh arrived after a months 
delay for repairs it carries a 400man us marine combat force 
european navies are withdrawing more rapidly with belgiums last 
minesweeper recently departed the netherlands last leaving dec 2 
and italys five warships heading home before dec 31

a computer failure that cost the state up to 
700000 in lost lottery ticket sales is being investigated by 
specialists from the firm that set up the troubled lotto 649 
terminals officials said 
experts from gtech based in providence ri were to inspect 
the software that caused the 3yearold lotterys worst computer 
breakdown 
the computer crash came as the state was ending an investigation 
of problems with gtech which has been fined 17 million for 
computer mishaps since the company got the lotto 649 contract 
in october 1986 a report of the investigation is due friday said 
lottery director chon gutierrez 
the computer failure saturday night affected up to 4700 of the 
state lotterys 7200 lotto 649 terminals 
a backup system restored service to all but 120 terminals about 
12 minutes later lottery spokeswoman susan kossack said what is 
unusual is that all of the terminals on the backup system did not 
come back up she said 
in spite of the outage three players picked all six numbers 
correctly to win 2 million each 
gtech which operates lotto under a 220 million fiveyear 
contract with the state is subject to fines for each minute of 
computer lapse that occurs up to eight hours before the wednesday 
and saturday drawings 
gtech faces a fine of close to 200000 as a result of the 
failure lottery computer director joanne hoffman told the los 
angeles times 
however leonard g morrissey gtechs senior vice president 
told the rocky mountain news in denver that his company probably 
would have to pay less than 1000 in fines for saturdays 
breakdown gtech is installing the system for colorados lottery 
which is scheduled to begin jan 24 
in a related development the san francisco chronicle and the 
times reported tuesday that gtech has been investigated by auditors 
from the lottery and the state controllers office 
the twomonth investigation was prompted by allegations from two 
lottery telecommunications systems analysts who contended that gtech 
concealed computer malfunctions to avoid paying the state damages 
for lost lotto revenue 
lew ritter chief of security for the state lottery called the 
allegations just a bunch of baloney he predicted that gtech 
will be cleared of wrongdoing 
cynthia nebergall gtechs general counsel declined to discuss 
the allegations citing company policy 
the two complaining workers who have been transferred from their 
jobs pending the investigation allege that lottery officials are 
covering up for gtech

the federal aviation administration today 
proposed modifications in the takeoff alarm systems on virtually all 
us commercial jetliners to guard against electrical failures 
officials said 
the directive which would apply to more than 3700 commercial 
jets would require installation of a warning light in the cockpit 
to warn pilots when the takeoff alarm system loses electrical power 
the agency said 
the alarm is designed to alert a pilot that his plane and 
especially control devices such as wing flaps is not in the proper 
configuration for a takeoff 
airlines have until february to comment on the proposal and then 
a year to comply although some air carriers are expected to make 
the changes sooner officials said 
faa officials said the modifications are not expected to 
interrupt normal airline service because they likely will be done 
during routine maintenance and would probably take only about 20 
hours of work per plane 
faa spokesman fred farrar said installation of the cockpit light 
which must be clearly visible to all flight crew members is 
estimated to cost about 1050 per aircraft 
the crash on aug 16 1987 of northwest airlines flight 255 
during a takeoff from detroits metro international airport was 
blamed on the failure of the flight crew to set the planes wing 
flaps properly for takeoff the crashed killed 156 people 
investigators also are examining the possibility of an improper 
flap setting in the crash of a delta air lines jet at dallas last 
august in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed there was 
no sounding of the takeoff alarm system in that aircraft either 
the detroit crash involved a mcdonnell douglas md80 while the 
crash in texas involved a boeing 727 
according the faa the directive will cover virtually all 
commercial jetliners including those produced by the boeing co 
mcdonnell douglas lockheed and airbus industrie the european 
aircraft manufacturing consortium 
in some aircraft the modification may already have been made 
one source said the faadirected correction is aimed at warning the 
flight crew of an electrical short in the alarm system as some 
investigators have suggested likely occurred in the northwest 
jetliner that crashed in detroit 
the national transportation safety board last may concluded that 
northwest flight 255 crashed because the pilots did not set the wing 
flaps to the proper takeoff position preventing the md80 from 
gaining proper lift 
the ntsb determined in the investigation that the alarm which 
governed the takeoff flaps did not sound because of an interruption 
of electrical power investigators could not determine conclusively 
what caused the power interruption the safety board said 
at the time however the air line pilots association maintained 
that there was a possible inherent problem with the alarm systems 
that made them susceptible to electrical problems the ntsb said it 
could not determine whether the electrical short was due to such a 
defect but also did not rule out the possibility that the flight 
crew might have pulled a circuit breaker to prevent nuisance alarms

a graying group of civil rights warriors some 
black and some jewish gathered to take a look back at their 
coalition against segregation and to acknowledge things are no 
longer the same between them 
we are not bosom buddies in the way we were in the intense days 
of the 60s said courtland cox a black man from washington who 
was among about 70 participants in mondays sessions of a conference 
aimed at chronicling blackjewish cooperation 
cox and several other black speakers emphasized the potential for 
reuniting the groups which have sometimes clashed over methods of 
integration the rights of palestinians under the jewish government 
of israel and alleged antisemitism by some blacks 
there was some ambivalence where the movement was split but 
now we can heal those splits said james farmer of fredericksburg 
va a black who helped found the congress of racial equality 
farmer recalled his trip to mississippi in 1964 to investigate 
the disappearances of three civil rights workers two of them 
andrew goodman and michael schwerner were jewish and farmer said 
mississippi authorities referred to them as jew boys 
the two along with a black man james chaney were later found 
dead 
even earlier farmer said jews became natural allies of blacks 
because of antisemitism fanned by the ku klux klan and the lynching 
of jewish businessman leo frank in georgia in 1915 
jewish americans came to realize that their enemies were the 
enemies of blacks too he said 
conference participants today held a memorial service for the 
movements martyrs and others who have died in the intervening years 
carolyn goodman of new york mother of andrew goodman read a 
brief quotation from the rev martin luther king jr and ben chaney 
of new york brother of james chaney read from the diary of anne 
frank during the service 
they joined hands as the group concluded the service by singing 
we shall overcome 
most speakers at the sessions found no fault with selfinterest 
as a motive for jewish aid to the civil rights movement 
but one black participant lolis eli of new orleans said he 
found jews no more helpful than other whites except for the fear of 
their own persecution 
i think that many of the jews almost in gratitude feel that 
blacks have taken a lot of the punishment that jews would have to 
take if blacks were not present eli said 
rabbi israel dresner said his religious beliefs propelled him 
into the freedom rides and four arrests in the south 
i came because thats what judaism teaches that we are all 
part of the human family said dresner of wayne nj i came 
because of jewish history i came because of the holocaust i came 
because of slavery in egypt 
for william taylor of washington a former staff attorney for the 
naacp legal defense fund the process worked in reverse 
a large part of my identity as a jew comes out of that struggle 
of blacks and jews together taylor said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people and several other black 
speakers praised their jewish colleagues and downplayed the 
importance of their motives 
i dont want to argue about intent i want to argue about 
effect hooks said 
on monday evening the group went to the crypt of martin luther 
king jr at the king center for nonviolent social change 
somewhere along the way we sort of lost contact lloyd 
cutler the king centers executive vice president said he called 
for a renewed blackjewish coalition to battle threats such as 
racist skinhead groups 
the conference titled the blackjewish alliance reunion and 
renewal is sponsored by the king and carter centers the 
washingtonbased marjorie j kovler institute for blackjewish 
relations and the religious action center of reform judaism

senate democrats today elected george mitchell 
as their majority leader and mitchell said he was ready to move 
forward with george bushs white house on the federal deficit and 
other major issues 
the senator from maine was elected in a closed meeting by a 
unanimous voice vote after first narrowly missing a majority in his 
race against sens daniel inouye of hawaii and bennett johnston of 
louisiana 
the federal deficit health care day care and the environment 
were top priorities said mitchell who planned to meet wednesday 
with sen bob dole of kansas reelected by republicans as their 
leader earlier in the day 
asked if he would cooperate with bush mitchell said we hope 
to move forward on a broad range of issues 
the democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals 
of the next administration he said 
mitchell appointed to the senate in 1980 elected in 1982 and 
reelected earlier this month will succeed robert c byrd dwva 
who decided to step down as majority leader to become chairman of 
the senate appropriations committee 
byrd who was also elected as the senates president pro tempore 
announced the vote to reporters he handed his gavel to mitchell 
before television cameras then stepped back as his successor moved 
to the microphones to take questions 
byrd will become chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
mitchell garnered 27 votes on the first ballot one short of a 
majority among the 55 democrats in the new senate inouye and 
johnston each received 14 
johnston then moved that mitchell be approved unanimously inouye 
seconded the motion after the vote johnston said 
the best man won george mitchell will be a great majority 
leader 
sen alan cranston of california was reelected as the partys 
whip defeating sen wendell ford of kentucky there was no recorded 
vote 
although the least senior of the three candidates mitchell is 
considered a strong spokesman for the party a new england liberal 
the former federal prosecutor and judge has a reputation as a 
skilled thoughtful legislator 
mitchell 55 is a liberal like inouye but less traditionbound 
he appealed to democrats seeking someone who would appear less 
ideological but still could act as a strong public speaker for the 
party 
mitchell will bring to the post of majority leader a far 
different style than byrd who was democratic leader for a decade 
byrds tenure was marked by his mastery and manipulation of the 
senate rules and his distinctive personality although very 
secretive about his legislative dealings byrd would display before 
the senate his memory of poetry and history both of which he would 
recite at length in the chamber 
mitchell is less of a senate institution and far more open 
personally than byrd although more liberal democratic colleagues 
describe him as a consensus builder and not an ideologue 
and while relations between byrd and dole often seemed strained 
there is potential for a strong working relationship between 
mitchell and dole the two men have served together since 1981 on 
the senate finance committee and always speak well of each other 
inouye 64 pitched himself as the most experienced of the three 
his liberal voting record is in line with traditional democrats 
johnston 56 and the most conservative of the three cited his 
southern roots and parliamentary skill 
the three candidates besides representing different regions 
offered different perspectives for the democrats 
aside from those broad themes the candidates appealed to their 
colleagues on very personal issues such as demands for choice 
committee assignments and changes in the senate rules and schedule 
dole the kansas senator who recently has been meeting with bush 
to settle their differences was reelected in a voice vote that 
reinstalled three republican officers who faced no opposition said 
walt riker doles spokesman 
alan simpson rwyo was reelected minority whip bill 
armstrong rcolo was returned as chairman of the republican 
policy committee and thad cochran rmiss was kept on as gop 
secretary riker said 
the gop conference chairman sen john chafee rri defeated 
challenger frank murkowski ralaska by 2817 to retain his post 
riker said sen don nickles rokla defeated sen john mccain 
rariz on a vote of 2817 to head the national republican 
senatorial committee 
while the camps of all three contenders for the majority leaders 
position voiced optimism before the vote senators said monday that 
the outcome was uncertain each of the contestants was continually 
polling the 55member democratic majority but the answers received 
might be more positive than the results in todays secret ballot

residents used to climbing down a steep 
bank to dip muddy water out a stream have won a 15year battle to 
have clean water pumped into their southwestern mississippi town 
the community of 40 residents 65 miles southwest of jackson will 
receive a 105500 community development block grant and a 50500 
loan from the farmers home administration to hook up with the water 
system in nearby pattison us rep mike espy announced this week 
he said workers hope to supply water within four months to blue 
hill where only three residents could afford wells many residents 
have relied on rain and creek water for bathing and on friends in 
neighboring communities for drinking water 
we didnt have much other choice said jake savage 65 who 
has sometimes driven his truck to the creek two or three times a day 
to fill containers with water most of the others had to do the 
same thing 
the project will assure a safe drinking water supply for blue 
hill residents said joe brown chief of the state bureau of 
environmental health 
any time you can bring running water into a community and fresh 
water directly to the houses you improve living standards and help 
in protecting the health of people living there he said 
this is the cry of rural america espy told the residents and 
officials gathered at the creek bank monday rural america at 
least since 1981 hasnt been high on the agenda of the people who 
control the purse strings 
espy added similar water problems exist in communities in three 
other mississippi counties 
the grant could not have come soon enough for residents here 
we need it bad said jerry savage jake savages son as he 
knelt over the creek weve been going there to get water for 15 
years 
james cole who has a well said he shared water with residents 
who lived across the creek until a wooden bridge over the creek 
washed out a year ago 
weve been fighting for it for 15 years our peopleve just 
been put off cole said

secretary of state george p shultz said today 
the strong opposition to his decision to bar a visit by plo chairman 
yasser arafat to the united states shows that people are forgetting 
what a threat international terrorism is 
under questioning at a groundbreaking ceremony for a state 
department annex shultz said he was sorry about the breadth of the 
opposition to his decision but that he will stick by it 
in addition to arab countries great britain west germany and 
italy among other allies all have criticized shultzs decision 
to some extent the opposition suggests how important it was to 
decide what was decided and to make it so clear what the basis 
was shultz said 
the basis was our concern about terrorism and i am afraid 
that its too easy for people to forget what an important problem 
that is and what a threat it is to civilized society

las vegas likes its privacy and los angeles 
would rather you write than call if a survey of unlisted phone 
numbers is any indication 
las vegas ranked no 1 in the nation with 60 percent of its phone 
numbers unlisted while about 56 percent of people with numbers in 
los angeles county do not list them in phone directories according 
to survey sampling inc a connecticut company that sells phone 
numbers to market research companies 
in los angeles the 56 percent figure was a 4 percent increase 
from two years ago 
the rate of unlistedness is definitely jumping especially in 
the top unlisted markets said john lamb of survey sampling 
younger people ages 18 to 30 are tending not to list their phone 
numbers our suspicion is that they feel it keeps telemarketers from 
getting to them 
not listing a number wont deter all phone solicitors however 
lamb noted many companies use computers that call every number in 
sequence listed or not 
california is the leader when it comes to residents who dont 
want their phone numbers listed ten of the top 20 unlisted cities 
in the nation are in the golden state with oakland fresno san 
jose and sacramento all in the top 10 
other communities with a high share of unlisted phone numbers are 
jersey city nj newark nj bergenpassaic nj el paso 
texas houston and chicago

john tower has been talked about as a potential 
defense secretary for the better part of a decade so its no 
surprise that hes now considered the frontrunner for that post in 
the new bush administration 
but it isnt coming easily with almost daily reports of 
negotiations over conditions presidentelect george bush wants to 
set before appointing his fellow texan 
no one doubts the military expertise of the 63yearold tower he 
was chairman of the armed services committee when he retired from 
the senate in 1985 after 24 years and he served as an arms 
negotiator for president reagan after that 
by all accounts despite apparent opposition from some bush 
aides tower is the leading choice to head the pentagon for the new 
president however he was mentioned as a possible defense secretary 
for president reagan a development that never occurred 
a source close to the bush transition office said tuesday that a 
decision on tower could come by wednesday 
the source who spoke only on condition he not be named said 
bush likes tower and thinks he would do a good job at the pentagon 
but some bush advisers have raised objections partly because they 
do not have a high regard for a number of people who have worked for 
tower and might have an inside track for top pentagon jobs should he 
be named the negotiations supposedly concern who would control 
which appointments on towers pentagon team 
tower himself has said little in public in recent days his aides 
say each day when asked no call from the white house yet 
tower has worked for bush before in fact he was one of bushs 
key emissaries to the platform committee at the republican national 
convention last summer essentially speaking for bush in the 
negotiations 
in the senate tower championed reagans military buildup and 
increase in defense spending but if he gets the pentagon job hell 
become bushs point man 
and bush in publicly describing the role of his defense 
secretary said last week that his nominee must be willing to take 
a fresh tough look in these times of budgetary crunch at the 
defense department 
also the presidentelects choice for national security adviser 
brent scowcroft suggested cuts of at least 300 billion from the 
reagan administrations military spending plans for 1990 to 1994 
the suggestions were included in a report presented to bush by 
former presidents ford and carter 
on other military subjects tower 
favors reagans strategic defense initiative popularly known as 
star wars and is a leading supporter of the mx missile he has 
called them important elements in negotiating with the soviet 
union 
despite supporting the mx opposes reagans plan for fixed 
deployment of the weapon preferring the carter administrations 
plan to move the missile deceptively 
opposes the unratified 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty 
with the soviet union a pact that tower believes does not reduce 
nuclear capabilities 
shortly after retiring from the senate tower was named a us 
arms control negotiator in geneva where he concentrated on reduction 
of longrange nuclear weapons 
he quit that post after 14 months for what us officials said 
privately were family reasons and because he believed the job lacked 
excitement 
in november 1986 reagan chose tower to head a commission 
investigating the irancontra affair in its final report issued in 
february 1987 the panel blamed the armsforhostages dealing in 
part on reagans laidback management style it had little to say 
about any possible bush involvement 
tower gained national attention in 1960 when he lost to 
democratic sen lyndon b johnson who ran for both reelection and 
the vice presidency johnson resigned his senate seat and tower 
defeated the appointed replacement democrat william a blakley in 
a special election by a mere 8000vote margin 
the son of a methodist minister tower a onetime democrat 
former radio announcer and insurance salesman was the first 
republican elected by texas voters to the us senate two gop 
senators in the postcivil war period had been named by the texas 
legislature 
in the earlier campaign against johnson the 5foot6 tower won 
over voters with his selfdeprecating line my name is tower but 
you can see that i dont 
in his last reelection campaign tower refused to shake his 
opponents hand when they met by accident and he described his 
rival as a little lord fauntleroy 
tower recently was divorced from his second wife lilla burt 
cummings the messy legal battle included accusations that tower 
committed marital misconduct

easy answer a question about the first day of autumn and win keys 
to a brandnew porsche

the offer has been fired and theobald is still waiting for a 
porsche he hasnt even gotten the keys he says 
i got through and i gave him the right answer theobald a 
21yearold biology student at william and mary college in virginia 
said monday 
after receiving a letter from theobalds lawyer who also is his 
brother station managers fired mcdonald but they still say the 
whole thing was obviously a joke and they have no intention of 
giving away a porsche 
mcdonald offered the keys to the first caller who could explain 
what was special about the day sept 22 theobald listening to 
the chicago station from his home in williamsburg va was the 
first person to call and say it was the first day of autumn 
you win the keys to the car mcdonald said according to a 
transcript read by wls operations manager richard lippincott when 
theobald asked if it was a joke mcdonald said it wasnt adding 
i have absolutely no idea where the car is but you get the keys 
about a month later theobald mentioned the incident to his 
brother ed a chicago attorney 
ed theobald said radio contests are regulated by the federal 
communications commission which requires that stations deliver what 
they promise it was definitely my brothers understanding that he 
would win the car he said monday 
when wls received a letter from tom theobald on nov 14 inquiring 
about the car mcdonald was suspended he was fired three days 
later lippincott said 
mcdonalds telephone number could not be obtained through 
directory information and the station would not provide it 
the station doesnt plan to give away a car 
i dont think we owe the guy a porsche lippincott said 
its obvious from the transcript that he understood he won the 
keys and not the car 
meanwhile tom theobald will drive his datsun with 140000 miles

the system set up by the government to 
assure that meat produced in the united states is free of dangerous 
chemicals has broken down us department of agriculture 
investigators reported 
the results of an investigation by the usda office of inspector 
general were contained in a report circulated among usda officials 
the findings were reported tuesday by the des moines register 
the report said testing at meat plants was not done randomly 
allowing violators to avoid detection when chemical contamination 
was found action was seldom taken to prevent sale of the tainted 
meat the report said 
federal officials were unable in most cases to trace animals with 
illegal chemical or pesticide residues to producers and seldom took 
followup samples to determine if the violations were continuing 
the report said 
the report said some adulterated products were allowed to enter 
commerce 
because the department did not consult the environmental 
protection agency on what residue levels are safe there is no 
assurance pesticides are being monitored at levels necessary to 
protect the public health the report said 
the usda food safety and inspection service is responsible for 
ensuring that governmentinspected meat and poultry are wholesome 
inspectors are to randomly collect meat and poultry samples at 
plants and if high levels of residue are detected movement of the 
meat to market is supposed to be controlled and the producers are to 
be identified 
the report said the fsis is hampered by laws that allow testing 
only at slaughter plants it recommended laws allowing testing at 
production and sales sites 
the report said samples were gathered at some plants at routine 
and predictable times such trends could allow plants to 
manipulate slaughter schedules to prevent detection of known or 
suspected violations the report said

two explosions rocked a highway 
construction site early today killing six firefighters battling 
suspicious fires at the scene officials said the force of the 
blasts shattered windows 10 miles away 
the blasts left two large craters 30 to 40 feet wide and six or 
seven feet deep the charred wreckage of one firetruck was near one 
of the craters but the other firetruck there is absolutely no 
evidence that it was ever there said fire department spokesman 
harold knabe 
a seventh firefighter who was near the site with a department 
car was injured and taken to the hospital said knabe 
the first blast shortly after 4 am involved an estimated 
30000 pounds of ammonium nitrate knabe said about 20 minutes 
later there was a second explosion that involved about 15000 pounds 
of ammonium nitrate 
residents of a twomile area around the blast site were 
evacuated one resident was hospitalized in good condition after 
complaining of chest pains and five other residents went to 
research medical center but were released after treatment or 
observation 
knabe said a first fire was spotted in a pickup truck while two 
guards looked for someone they thought they had seen in the area a 
second fire broke out in a trailer that contained explosives and it 
spread to a second trailer 
were assuming that someone did set both fires because both of 
them did occur when both security people were away from the area 
knabe said the guards were not hurt he said 
police sgt gregory mills said he could not estimate the size of 
the two trailers that exploded because there aint nothing there 
anymore 
firefighters and a bomb squad moved into the area of the blast 
around daybreak to look for other explosives authorities said the 
victims bodies had been recovered 
the fire department called the deaths the departments worst loss 
since recordkeeping started in 1899 the most deaths among 
firefighters previously five occurred in a gasoline storage tank 
explosion in august 1959 
the explosions occurred at a construction site on the southern 
edge of kansas city about 1 miles northwest of bannister mall one 
of the areas busiest shopping malls a number of quarries are 
located adjacent to the highway construction site 
we have a very serious situation windows are busted out all 
over the area kansas city police asked us to help cordon off the 
area said tom taylor of suburban raytown a member of an 
emergency rescue squad 
the ammonium nitrate was stored at the site and was used to blast 
the quarry and clear rock for the highway construction officials 
said 
authorities said windows were blown out of homes and businesses 
over at least a 10mile area around the site 
roger ware manager of a service station in the neighborhood 
said the first blast lifted my cash register about 3 inches off 
the counter it knocked a lot of merchandise over or off my 
shelves 
about a dozen windows were broken at marion laboratories incs 
distribution and computer center near the blast site 
larry wheeler a company spokesman said five people working in 
the building at the time of the explosion escaped injury he said 
the 75 to 100 people who work there were told to stay home for the 
day 
the nearby john deere co also sustained damaged and workers 
there were told not to report to work today 
power was knocked out in the area for about one hour 
several residents said the explosions almost lifted them out of 
their beds 
knabe said the first two fire crews at the scene called for a 
battalion chief firefighters were battling the blaze in the first 
trailer when the battalion chief arrived and the first explosion 
occurred 
as his driver got out of the car the explosion knocked him 
several feet blew out the window in the chiefs car and threw it 
back on the chief the chief managed to get the radio and call for 
additional help knabe said 
he said the explosion spread fire to the second trailer which 
exploded 20 minutes later 
mills estimated that the battalion chiefs car about 150 feet 
from the burning trailer was knocked back about 25 feet but he was 
not injured 
people in the area complained of natural gas leaks after the 
explosions said hal hudson a spokesman for kpl gas service co 
hudson said utility crews have not been able to get into the area of 
the explosion to determine the extent of damage to the companys 
facilities

a divided supreme court in a decision some 
members said is unnecessarily sweeping ruled tuesday the rights of 
criminal defendants are not violated when police unintentionally 
fail to preserve potentially vital evidence 
the court also said the constitution does not require police to 
conduct stateoftheart tests in examining evidence 
by a 63 vote the justices reinstated an arizona mans 
conviction in the kidnaping and sodomizing of a 10yearold boy 
the justices reversed a lower court ruling that the mans rights 
were violated because police failed to preserve and analyze properly 
semen samples from the childs body and clothing evidence which 
in theory could have exonerated the defendant 
in another decision the high court reinforced the right of the 
poor to have a lawyers help in appealing convictions the justices 
voting 81 said an ohio appeals court improperly allowed an 
attorney to withdraw from representing a convicted rapist and robber 
without explaining in detail why he believed an appeal was frivolous 
in the arizona case an appeals court threw out the conviction 
and 10year prison sentence of larry youngblood he was convicted of 
kidnapping a boy on oct 29 1983 from a church carnival in the 
tucson area police said the boy was driven to a house raped four 
times during a 90minute ordeal and then released 
chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for the high 
court tuesday said youngblood did not prove that police 
deliberately failed to preserve evidence 
unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of 
the police failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not 
constitute a denial of due process of law rehnquist said 
requiring a defendant to show bad faith on the part of police 
both limits the extent of the polices obligation to preserve 
evidence to reasonable bounds and confines it to those cases in 
which police themselves indicate that the evidence could form a 
basis for exonerating the defendant he said 
rehnquist said the obligation of authorities to preserve evidence 
is not as great as their duty to turn over to defendants all 
existing evidence including material that could help acquit the 
accused 
also he continued the constitution does not require police to 
use the best available technology to test the reliability of 
evidence 
comparing the case to one in which police fail to use a 
breathalyzer to determine if a motorist was intoxicated he added 
police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular 
tests 
but justice harry a blackmun in a dissenting opinion said 
police ineptitude deprived youngblood of his right to a fair 
trial 
the constitution requires that criminal defendants be provided 
with a fair trial not merely a good faith try at a fair trial he 
said by what may have been nothing more than police ineptitude 
youngblood was denied the opportunity to present a full defense 
blackmun also said there was no need for the court to decide 
whether police must use the cutting edge of technology in analyzing 
evidence 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
justice john paul stevens joined the majority in voting to 
reinstate youngbloods conviction but stevens said the court went 
too far in holding that criminal defendants must prove bad faith by 
police when crucial evidence is lost or destroyed 
youngblood convicted of child molesting sexual assault and 
kidnapping was identified as the assailant from police photographs 
shown to the boy 
laboratory specialists found traces of semen on the boy and also 
in clothing he was wearing 
it was not until a year later that the semen was tested to 
determine blood typing of the assailant but no blood group 
substances were found 
the semen sample taken from the boys body was refrigerated the 
clothing which might have contained a larger quantity of semen was 
not 
youngblood was determined to be what is known as a secretor with 
blood type a that means that his blood group could be determined 
from his semen 
the absence of blood group substances in the semen taken from the 
victim suggested that the boys attacker either was a nonsecretor 
or that the samples were too small to determine blood type 
there also was testimony that technologically advanced tests to 
determine blood grouping were not performed on the semen samples 
an arizona appeals court threw out youngbloods conviction on 
grounds that had stateoftheart tests been performed and had the 
best technology been used to preserve the evidence youngblood might 
have been found innocent

the general assembly today delayed its 
annual debate on the palestinian problem the first step toward 
convening a special session outside new york to hear plo chief 
yasser arafat 
general assembly president dante caputo told the assembly he had 
received a request from arab nations to postpone the debate 
scheduled for thursday friday and dec 6 
since there were no objections caputo said the request was 
granted caputo the argentine foreign minister said earlier the 
assembly would move swiftly to provide arafat an alternative forum 
the united states on saturday denied arafat an entry visa 
diplomats have said that unless the united states reverses its 
decision the un debate on palestine will shift to geneva so 
arafat can address the general assembly no new date has been set 
for the debate 
arab representatives today drafted a resolution expressing regret 
over the us action and saying the united states violated its legal 
obligations by denying arafat a visa 
the resolution was to be introduced later today before a un 
committee and may go to the general assembly late today or wednesday 
saturdays decision by secretary of state george p shultz to bar 
arafat from the country on grounds he was an accessory to acts 
of terrorism against americans has been widely criticized by dozens 
of countries including the arab world and such staunch us allies 
as britain canada and australia 
only israel backed the us decision 
in washington the state department said monday the us decision 
to deny the visa was firm and final 
a senior un official said on condition of anonymity that if the 
united states still refuses to grant arafat a visa another 
resolution probably will called this week for moving the assembly to 
geneva 
arab diplomats say they have enough votes a simple majority in 
the 159member body to shift the assembly to where arafat would be 
able to speak 
un legal counsel carlaugust fleischhauer told a un committee 
the us decision violates the 1947 usun headquarters agreement 
that requires the host country to grant visas to people invited by 
the united nations 
the agreement does not contain a reservation of the right to 
bar the entry of those who represent in the view of the host 
country a threat to its sovereignty and security fleischhauer 
said 
patricia byrne alternate us representative said the us 
government disagreed with fleischhauers interpretation but she did 
not elaborate 
many nations in the world body said the us action countered 
what they described as the palestine liberation organizations move 
toward modernization with its declaration of palestinian 
independence nov 15 that also implicitely recognized israel 
the un committee on relations with the host country heard 
numerous speakers assail the us decision to ban arafat 
iraqi ambassdador ismat kittani told the committee the 
decision by washington is a slap in the face of equal measure to 
every member of this organization 
the soviet union and china and us allies france spain sweden 
and norway among others said arafat should be allowed to speak 
arafat called the us move a sheer violation of the 
international law and the un charter and said washington was 
ignoring international backing for the independent state of 
palestine proclaimed this month by the palestine national council 
the plos parliamentinexile 
state department spokesman charles redman said the shift to 
geneva was unnecessary because other plo spokesmen in new york could 
speak instead of arafat 
probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at 
the peace process as the united states has redman said 
presidential spokesman marln fitzwater said we were making no 
kind of statement about the united nations but about yasser arafat 
and terrorism

a presidential council tuesday 
rejected a proposed bill that would have tightened enforcement of 
residential segregation laws 
antiapartheid leaders welcomed the move but urged the government 
to scrap all discriminatory laws including measures extremeright 
local officials are using to resegregate public facilities 
last week the conservative partycontrolled town council in 
boksburg voted to bar blacks from most municipal facilities on 
tuesday conservative councilors in brakpan another industrial town 
near johannesburg similarly decided to ban blacks from public 
parks toilets and sports facilities 
the presidents council dominated by the governing national 
party sent the residential segregation bill back to president pw 
botha with a recommendation it be redrafted to ease penalties and 
decriminalize some offenses related to the group areas act the act 
a cornerstone of south africas legalized race segregation called 
apartheid prevents people of one race from living in areas 
designated for each of the other race groups 
the bill was referred to the council because of a deadlock in 
parliament it was passed by the national partydominated white 
chamber but rejected by the asian and mixedrace chambers 
south africas majority 26 million blacks are not represented in 
parliament and have no vote in national affairs 
the proposal to impose sharply increased fines on violators of 
the group areas act had been widely criticized abroad and by 
antiapartheid activists in south africa even before it reached the 
presidents council the bill was softened by removal of a proposal 
for mandatory evictions of people living illegally outside their 
designated race zones 
peter marais a mixedrace council member likened the bill to 
nazi persecution of the jews 
several antiapartheid council members said discriminatory laws 
caused the current controversy in boksburg 
what is happening in boksburg must be a lesson to all of us 
said marais dont leave matches lying around for children to play 
with 
the actions in boksburg have been criticized by government 
officials white businessmen and sports organizations as well as 
local blacks who have begun to boycott the industrial towns 
whiteowned businesses 
foreign minister pik botha warned it could cause tougher 
sanctions and urged people to oppose discrimination based merely 
on the color of ones skin 
businessmen and several national sports organizaions have warned 
they will shun boksburg because of the negative publicity 
some liberals suggested the outcry was hypocritical because 
boksburg council is exercising discriminatory powers allowed under 
the national partyapproved separate amenities act and employed 
elsewhere including in the capital city pretoria 
mr botha seems to be missing the point said jannie momberg 
cochairman of the antiapartheid independent party what the 
conservative party is doing is legal its national party laws 
that have given south africa a bad name

president mikhail s gorbachev bowed to criticism 
of his constitutional reforms tuesday saying he will accept tighter 
limits on presidential power and try to accommodate republics 
clamoring for more autonomy 
gorbachev acknowledging the political giveandtake forming in 
the freer atmosphere he has fostered told the supreme soviet or 
parliament 
our own socialist system of checks and balances is taking 
shape in this country designed to protect society from any 
violations of socialist legality at the highest state level 
the supreme soviet is considering during its threeday session a 
package of almost 120 articles of legislation first published five 
weeks ago that gorbachev says are the first major step toward a 
political system based on law not central dictate 
but the draft laws faced stiff criticism that they actually 
stengthen the presidency which gorbachev assumed on oct 1 against 
the legislature and strengthen moscows power against that of the 
15 soviet republics 
the unprecedented criticism of the proposed legislation was 
highlighted by the estonian republics nov 16 declaration of 
sovereignty over all internal affairs and demand to review all new 
soviet legislation several supreme soviet deputies including two 
top officials from the baltic republics registered dissatisfaction 
tuesday with elements of the reform 
arnold ruutel the estonian president told reporters that 
surpreme soviet deputies only received copies of the amended 
proposals on tuesday they have not been published 
but gorbachev detailing some of the changes to the 1500 supreme 
soviet members said it is obvious that some of the provisions of 
the bills were not formulated precisely enough and cuased quite a 
few critical remarks in the course of discussions 
the draft now gives the ussr supreme soviet the right to 
repeal decrees and decisions by its presidium and orders by the 
supreme soviet president gorbachev said 
that was implied in the soviet constitution which requires 
supreme soviet confirmation of directives of the presidium the 
highest executive body on which gorbachev serves as chairman 
but the supreme soviet almost never has challenged any such 
directive and the proposed constitutional amendments said nothing 
about supreme soviet review 
gorbachevs reforms call for the formation next year of a 
congress of peoples deputies a 2250member legislative body that 
will include representation from the communist party trade and 
creative unions and social organizations as well as geographical 
legislative districts the congress will choose a smaller supreme 
soviet which is to become more active 
he said the congress would have power to recall any official it 
appoints including the president 
the supreme soviet would have the powers of budget oversight and 
review of the actions of government ministries this right will 
definitely be used regularly in the new conditions he said 
it was not immediately clear whether gorbachev was giving up his 
proposal to strengthen the president by giving his the chairmanship 
of the defense council and responsibility for foreign policy 
in order to further strengthen the system of checks and balances 
gorbachev said a constitutional review commission would be formed 
and that judges would be given considerably more independence 
to meet complaints from small republics the amendments now give 
all 15 republics stronger representation in one house of the supreme 
soviet the soviet of nationalities 
gorbachev who led the presidium on saturday in rejecting 
estonias challenge stressed the economic unity of the soviet union 
but a specific criticism of estonia originally included in a 
summary of gorbachevs remarks distributed by the tass news agency 
did not appear in the final version and he struck a conciliatory 
note 
gorbachev proposed creating a special commission to settle the 
question of division of powers between the central government and 
the republics 
soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov in a news conference 
told reporters that a section allowing central authorities to 
declare a state of emergency and call in soldiers to keep order had 
been amended to assure the republics any such operation would be 
temporary and that they would be consulted 
we are not approaching the constitution and the republics as 
something that has been set once and forever there will be changes 
and amendments he said 
but leaders of two baltic republics still objected 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov said direct representation of 
social and political organizations in the congress of peoples 
deputies could result in one person holding several seats in the the 
congress 
another baltic republic president vitautas astrauskas of 
lithuania called for a new constitution limiting the central 
government to national issues 
gorbachevs ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a news 
conference that he believed the estonian measures were adopted 
spontaneously under public sentiment and emotion that for a certain 
time got the upper hand in the republic 
im not inclined to agree they are an adequate reflection of 
public opinion in that republic he said

a japanese man called an international 
terrorist by prosecutors was found guilty tuesday of weapons charges 
and of transporting homemade bombs with the intent to commit 
sabotage 
us district judge alfred j lechner convicted yu kikumura in a 
nonjury trial after the 36yearold defendant admitted to the 
governments charges in an agreement worked out with prosecutors 
there is no contest and there is no alternative lechner 
said i find the defendant yu kikumura guilty of each count of the 
indictment 
lechner set sentencing for jan 23 kikumura faces up to 100 
years in prison 
under the agreement kikumura admitted to the charges but 
retained his right to appeal pretrial rulings if the pretrial 
rulings which bear on the admissibility of evidence against him 
are overturned his conviction could be thrown out 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said outside court that 
kikumura had come to this country to kill people 
this man is an international terrorist who sneaked into the 
united states using a skillfully forged passport he said hes 
someone who would have killed if he had not been stopped 
alito would say little about kikumuras target but that more 
information might emerge at sentencing 
were talking about buildings in which there are people he 
said 
the government has tied kikumura to the terrorist japanese red 
army and has said it is investigating his connections in the united 
states 
alito noted that kikumura was caught several days before the 
bombing of a uso club in naples italy and the anniversary of 
the us raid on libya a day later the finance ministers of seven 
major industrial nations ended a meeting in washington 
court documents showed kikumura traveled about 7000 miles around 
the country after arriving five weeks before his arrest he acquired 
equipment to make the bombs three fire extinguisher casings 
containing lead shot and gun powder on the trip 
kikumuras lawyers william kunstler and ronald kuby had said 
monday in court that they could not defeat the evidence and would 
seek to have the charges thrown out on appeal 
their announcement came on the first day of trial and moments 
after lechner rebuffed a lastditch effort to have the indictment 
dismissed because of the routine recording of kikumuras calls to 
his attorneys from the metropolitan correctional center in new york 
city 
kikumura has been at the federal lockup since shortly after his 
arrest april 12 at a new jersey turnpike rest area in ridgefield 
kikumura was charged with one count of transporting explosives 
interstate without a permit one count of transporting explosives 
with intent to kill injure or damage property one count of 
possession of firearms by an alien three counts of possessing 
unregistered firearms three counts of possessing firearms without 
serial numbers and three counts of using false travel documents 
kunstler and kuby said they would appeal lechners refusal to 
find a state troopers search of kikumuras car unconstitutional and 
thus suppress the evidence they said they also will seek to trim 
the number of counts in the indictment and to dismiss the case 
because of the prison phone recordings 
the arresting trooper said at an october hearing that the bombs 
were in plain view in kikumuras car and that kikumura acted 
suspiciously kikumura said the bombs were in the trunk that he was 
not acting suspiciously and that he never gave permission to search 
his car 
lechner said he found the trooper more credible he did not 
mention the witness testimony of a gas station attendant who 
supported kikumuras version 
kunstler said he never asked his client what he was doing in the 
united states

the nations economy shrugged off the summer 
drought and grew at a respectable 26 percent annual rate in the 
julyseptember period but inflation picked up the government said 
tuesday 
the commerce department said the performance of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of economic health slowed in 
the third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 30 percent in 
the second quarter and 34 percent in the first three months of the 
year 
it was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986 when 
the economy grew at a sluggish 14 percent rate 
however the department said the picture was distorted by the 
summer drought that hit much of the nation without the drought 
growth would have been 39 percent in the second quarter and 32 
percent in the third quarter 
so far a little less than half of the 128 billion in drought 
losses have been accounted for in the gnp they are likely to shave 
as much as 12 percent off the fourth quarter average 
if we hadnt had a drought where cows died and grain dried up 
gnp would have been much stronger said william dunkelberg dean 
of the school of business at temple university in philadelphia 
what that tells you is you have one hot economy on your hands 
but higher prices accompanied the growth the government said a 
price index tied to the gnp which is adjusted to exclude the 
effects of changing buying patterns rose at an annual rate of 51 
percent in the third quarter edging up from 50 percent in the 
second quarter it was the steepest increase in more than six years 
the growth figure and the price index represent revisions from an 
advance estimate last month when gnp was reported at a 22 percent 
rate and the price index at 49 percent 
in other economic developments 
the commerce department reported that aftertax corporate 
profits in the third quarter were nearly flat they rose only 02 
percent to 1631 billion following an exceptionally large increase 
of 89 percent a quarter earlier it was corporate americas poorest 
performance since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 
the agriculture department predicted food prices would rise by 3 
percent to 5 percent next year after rising about 4 percent this 
year the forecast came from james r donald chairman of the 
departments world agricultural outlook board 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the latest 
gnp report does not change the basic economic picture of 
moderate growth and steady inflation 
inflation remains at about the secondquarter rate and after 
adjusting for the effects of the drought the economy continues to 
grow at its longterm average pace which is 2 to 3 percent he 
said 
however private economists said the gnp report fits in with 
expectations in financial markets that the federal reserve will move 
soon to dampen growth particularly if the november unemployment 
report due this friday shows unemployment continuing at a 14year 
low 
growth so far in the second half of the year is too fast for 
stable inflation which suggests there could be some further fed 
tightening over the next few months said bruce steinberg an 
economist with merrill lynch amp co 
factories are operating at their highest level in more than eight 
years that coupled with fewer people looking for jobs could make 
it difficult for manufacturers to produce enough goods to meet 
demand 
higher interest rates are aimed at easing the demand by 
discouraging spending by both consumers and businesses 
on monday major banks raised their prime lending rate to 105 
percent the highest level since mid1985 that will increase rates 
on a variety of consumer loans if the fed decides to tigthen the 
prime rate could jump again before the end of the year analysts say 
robert dederick an economist with northern trust co in chicago 
said the mix of economic activity in the third quarter moved in the 
opposite direction from what fed policymakers want 
personal consumption expenditures which account for nearly 
twothirds of economic activity rose at an annual rate of 4 
percent compared with 30 percent in the second quarter 
the two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year 
exports and business investment played lesser roles 
the nations inflationadjusted trade deficit as measured by the 
gnp grew at an annual rate of 28 percent in the third quarter the 
first deterioration in a year business investment grew at an annual 
rate of 48 percent in the third quarter down from 150 percent in 
the second quarter 
consumer spending growth is at least double what they 
federal reserve members want to see thats excessive if we 
want to bring down our trade deficit without kicking up inflation 
dederick said 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at an annual rate of 401 trillion

a handwritten letter by napoleon bonaparte outlining 
secret plans to invade england sold at auction tuesday for 21186 
to a french collector 
this rare glimpse of napoleons genius was the highlight of a 
sale of rare books letters and manuscripts of some of frances most 
famous writers 
the fourpage letter in napoleons own hand is a piece of 
french history said jacques tajan of the aderpicardtajan 
auction house if the plan to invade england had worked the map 
of europe may well have been modified 
the buyers identity was not revealed 
an unusually rare eightvolume edition of the works of moliere 
creator of french high comedy was sold for 322000 to the 
bibliotheque nationale it is one of four first editions dating from 
1673 
the sale at the yearold drouot auction house annex off the 
champs elysees attracted military history buffs and bibliophiles 
it offered 50 pages of letters written by the french novelist 
stendhal while he followed napoleons armies in 181213 
in one letter he describes the horror of the burning of moscow 
while complaining about his empty stomach nagging toothache and the 
vulgarity of his compatriots 
one addressed to his sister dated oct 4 1812 went to the 
french archives for 35590 
we left the city illuminated by the most beautiful fire in the 
world the moon i believe shone above the fire it was a great 
spectacle but one had to be alone to see it this is the sad 
condition which ruined for me the russian campaign to have been 
with people who would have destroyed the colosseum and the sea of 
naples stendhal wrote 
all items were part of the vast collection of jacques guerin 
leading french collector and the man who defended the young marcel 
proust long before remembrance of things past was universally 
acclaimed 
the letter from napoleon to admiral ganteaume written dec 7 
1803 details three daring strategies for maneuvering 60 french 
ships across the english channel 
let us be masters of the strait for six hours and we will be 
masters of the world napoleon wrote 
the most complex of the plans involved moving one fleet to toulon 
and another toward iceland to trick britains lord nelson into 
heading for alexandria egypt while british land forces would be 
tied up protecting the countrys western coast against the fleet 
headed for iceland 
none of the plans were executed because the invasion fleet was 
struck repeatedly by storms and a major part engaged in a disastrous 
expedition to haiti 
other books from guerins collection included king louis xivs 
copy of racines esther a tragedy celebrating the sun kings 
generosity the queens devotion and religious harmony under his 
reign 
it appealed so much to louis that he would attend rehearsals and 
follow the dialogue with his own gold and leatherbound copy it 
sold for 59320

secretary of state george p shultz said 
tuesday the strong opposition to his decision to prevent plo 
chairman yasser arafat from visiting the united nations shows 
widespread insensitivity to the threat of international terrorism 
in his first public statement on the subject since his decision 
to reject arafats request for a us visa last saturday shultz 
said he was sorry but not surprised about the extent of the 
criticism he has received 
speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for a state department 
annex shultz said the magnitude of the opposition suggested that 
international terrorism had become a secondary issue for many 
the basis for the decision was our concern about terrorism 
and i am afraid that its too easy for people to forget what an 
important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized 
society he said 
referring to the presence of the palestine liberation 
organization observer mission in new york shultz said the 
palestinians will have no difficulty in getting their message across 
to other un members 
we have no problem with that he said 
since the state department rejection of arafats visa request 
worldwide opposition has been virtually unanimous ranging from arab 
countries to some of americas closest allies great britain west 
germany and italy 
one common argument mentioned by allied spokesmen was that 
shultzs decision weakens the hand of arab moderates 
shultz said the decision will not impair the peace process and 
that he will not reconsider it 
i think it was the right decision i stick by it he said 
meanwhile shultzs spokesman charles redman showed little 
interest in a statement by an adviser to arafat bassam abusherif 
who appeared to go a long way toward meeting us demands concerning 
the plo 
among other points abusharif said the plos position is one of 
full acceptance of israel and of rejection of the threat or use 
of terrorism by the palestinians 
redman said it sounds to me like one more statement from a 
palestinian spokesman its always a difficult thing determining 
whats authoritative and what isnt 
outside the state department a handful of demonstrators 
protested the rejection of arafats visa request 
the protesters gathered across the street from the departments 
main entrance where they waved palestinian flags pictures of 
arafat and signs 
in a letter to shultz khalil jahshan of the council of 
presidents of national arabamerican organizations called absurd 
the decision to refuse a visa to arafat on national security grounds 
although we disagree with your decision we honestly believe 
that it is never too late to correct it jahshan wrote to shultz

syrian troops arrested nearly 350 
proiranian gunmen in unprecedented housetohouse sweeps through 
beiruts moslem sector officials said tuesday 
the cleanup operation aimed at quelling bloody clashes that began 
thursday between rival shiite moslem militiamen and left 40 people 
dead and 87 wounded according to police count 
reporters said residents in khandak ghamik west beirut looked 
stunned as syrian soldiers staged a midmorning housetohouse search 
children and shiite women covered from head to ankle in black 
chador robes stood back in fright as the syrians tramped through 
their apartments reporters said 
a syrian source speaking on condition of anonymity said under 
syrian sponsorship amal and hezbollah have worked out a plan to 
enforce security in the southern slums 
it would be carried out soon under syrian supervision he said 
last weeks violence marked the first time in five months that 
syrianbacked amal and proiranian hezbollah militiamen fought in 
syriancontrolled districts of the city 
the fiveday confrontation began after four senior hezbollah 
officers escaped a carbomb assassination attempt in east lebanons 
syrianpatrolled bekaa valley 
lt col amir talleh the syrian officer supervising the house 
raids told the associated press the arrests started sunday in a 
wideranging operation to include beiruts southern slums once 
west beirut is completely cleaned 
most of the 14 foreign hostages held by proiranian lebanese 
groups are believed to be kept in the citys southern districts 
talleh said his troops took away three truckloads of sovietmade 
assault rifles rocketpropelled grenades ammunition and 
bulletproof vests from a hezbollah office 
it was shut down and guarded by 120 syrian troops thirty syrian 
soldiers were posted at an amal office where syrian soldiers 
confiscated similar weapons he said 
talleh refused to give a breakdown of arrests or say where the 
gunmen are being held 
but a lebanese police spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said almost all those arrested belong to hezbollah or 
party of god and will be handed over to the iranian embassy 
after questioning 
amal militiamen evacuated areas being searched by syrian troops 
and went home he said 
mohammed obeid a spokesman for amal arabic for hope said 
only two militia members were arrested and they were freed tuesday 
after a 24hour detention 
a 12000strong syrian peacekeeping force marched into south 
beirut in february 1987 and west beirut in may 1988 to end fighting 
like last weeks 
in may more than 300 people were killed and another 1000 
wounded in a bloody 19day confrontation that left hezbollah in 
control of south beirut 
four months later amals three top commanders were killed in an 
ambush in south beirut amal blamed hezbollah 
syria was irans main ally in the eightyear gulf war with iraq 
but in lebanon syrian control of eastern and northern areas of the 
country along with south and west beirut frequently is challenged 
by the hezbollah faction

the environmental protection agency on tuesday 
asked the public to comment on the cruel dilemma of whether it 
really is required to shut down los angeles auto use to meet clean 
air standards as some interpretations of the law seem to require 
such an action would be catastrophic the agency said 
though framed in terms of los angeles the legal issue could some 
day be applied to many of the 107 cities and rural counties that do 
not meet federal air pollution standards 
the agency is under court order to promulgate an air pollution 
control plan for the los angeles area by far the dirtiest of the 
107 and home to one american in 18 
los angeles fails to meet federal pollution standards for ozone 
and carbon monoxide and it is the only area not meeting standards 
for nitrogen oxides 
in recent years peak ozone concentrations have been almost three 
times the standard which typically is exceeded on 145 occasions 
annually no other city has peaks more than 75 percent above the 
standard or more than 35 violations per year 
ozone which damages the lungs in high concentrations is formed 
in sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides a combustion 
product with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as gasoline vapor 
or solvents the south coast air quality management district has 
estimated that an 80 percent to 90 percent reduction in hydrocarbon 
emissions half of which come from transportation fuels would be 
needed to meet the ozone standard in the los angeles area 
after several postponements all cities were supposed to meet the 
standards by dec 31 1987 but congress has never been able to 
decide what happens next 
epa has announced but not formally adopted plans generally 
requiring 3 percent annual reductions in emissions of the relevant 
pollutants beyond whatever reductions result from federal programs 
such as new auto standards 
though epa is involved in several court cases los angeles is the 
only area where epa is under orders to fulfill the legal mandate to 
impose its own control plan where it has found local plans 
inadequate 
tuesdays 142page notice asked what compliance date an epa plan 
should adopt 
epa tried before in 1973 to order drastic cutbacks in emissions 
in los angeles but in 1977 congress required new control plans to 
show attainment generally in three years to five years for los 
angeles now a plan aimed at attaining these standards in five 
years would have to ban the sale or use of fossil fuels for cars and 
trucks airplanes boats and trains epas announcement said 
such a plan would necessarily prohibit almost all hydrocarbon 
emissions from manufacturing activities and ban all products with 
hydrocarbon emissions for example paints waxes pesticides 
auto antifreeze cleaning products lubricants and suntan lotions 
it would be impossible for most people to commute to work and 
for most forms of commerce to continue it is evident that a 
shortterm federal plan would have catastrophic consequences and 
could be impossible to enforce epa said 
epa clearly preferred the alternative of embracing the ambitious 
plan now being developed by the south coast district aimed at 
compliance by 2007 when unspecified technological advances could 
make almost all cars in the area powered by electricity it asked 
for comment on the feasibility of adopting backstop federal 
measures to take effect if particular parts of the state plan fell 
by the wayside 
the agency said it would consider the public comments in 
conjunction with its judgments on the south coast plan expected to 
be formally submitted to the agency next spring 
epa published its dilemma on the same day the american lung 
association issued a strongly critical report of the agencys 
handling of state plans 
the association said local affiliates examined state plans for 
nine metropolitan areas hartford conn los angeles houston 
philadelphia washington st louis minneapolisst paul baltimore 
and chicago 
the affiliates reported significant failure to carry out promised 
control measures widespread failure of epa to meet deadlines for 
decisions lax operation of auto pollution inspections use of 
outofdate data and computer models and frequent double counting of 
emissions reductions

dissidents called tuesday for former 
president chun doohwan to stand trial for corruption and human 
rights abuses and they urged other political groups to support 
demands for a special tribunal 
president roh taewoo was studying plans to purge the government 
he was expected to fire as many as 11 ministers linked to chun to 
try to defuse public anger and present an unsullied administration 
dissident leaders accused the government of a cover up charging 
roh and his colleagues were implicated in past abuses associated 
with chun 
the struggle committee for the arrest of chun an alliance of 
dissident groups announced a meeting dec 5 of political parties 
and social groups to seek special legislation to investigate and try 
chun 
the main opposition parties which have been calling for 
appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate chun and his 
wife lee soonja did not react immediately to the dissidents call 
but top opposition leader kim daejung monday had repeated his 
resistance to jailing chun because he said he is against political 
retribution 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into rural exile at a buddhist monastery last week after 
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his sevenyear 
authoritarian rule 
the furor has dominated south korean politics with opposition 
groups demanding a full accounting the national assembly has been 
conducting public hearings into the chun government and findings 
have further fueled public anger 
dissidents have little public support because of their extremism 
but they have organized a series of large often violent protests in 
recent weeks to demand chuns arrest 
an alliance statement said chun must face trial for widespread 
corruption the deaths and jailings of political opponents and his 
role in the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern 
city of kwangju in which some 200 people died 
chun has denied personal corruption but some of his relatives 
and associates have been convicted of or charged with embezzling 
government funds and other crimes involving millions of dollars 
roh another former general and once a close chun ally appealed 
to the nation saturday for forgiveness for the former president but 
dissident and opposition groups responded by demanding a full 
investigation 
in a weekend appeal roh also promised to release as many 
political prisoners as possible and restore to other government 
opponents the civil rights of which they were stripped people 
facing trial for political protests would have their cases reviewed 
he said 
government officials who declined to be identified said at 
least 200 prisoners would be freed by early december police said 11 
students seized for trying to attack chuns house oct 31 were 
released tuesday 
roh took power february after chun stepped down roh won 
presidential elections in december after the opposition split its 
votes

a group of yonkers residents filed a lawsuit 
tuesday charging that a federal judges desegregation order deprived 
them of the right to live and work in neighborhoods free from 
lowclass people 
the suit filed in the 2nd us circuit court of appeals by the 
save yonkers federation was the latest skirmish in an eightyear 
legal battle that nearly brought the city of 195000 to financial 
ruin for defying the judge 
the federation comprises 13 citizens groups opposed to us 
district judge leonard sands order that yonkers build 1000 units 
of low and middleincome housing scattered throughout the city to 
remedy decades of segregation 
the suit which lists several hundred residents and merchants as 
petitioners maintains that the order deprives them of the 
benefits of living andor working in neighborhoods free from low 
class people of any race and the crime and housing rot which 
nearly always accompanies their presence 
to victimize the innocent because of wrongs by others by 
forcing upon those victims unwanted associations and by otherwise 
jeopardizing them their families and their property is surely to 
violate a constitutional sense of justice the suit said 
it said the residnets have lost value in their property and 
thus suffered economic injury 
the groups lawyer brooklyn law school professor henry mark 
holzer said the suit utilizes arguments never presented on behalf 
of the city those include what he said were a first amendment right 
not to associate with certain people and the tenth amendment 
establishment of federalism and separation of powers 
the lawsuit was filed in an appeals court instead of us 
district court because it challenges sands authority to impose the 
desegregation plan said holzer if the suit succeeds sand will 
have to refashion a remedy holzer said 
in 1985 five years after the us justice department filed suit 
sand found the city liable for 40 years of intentionally segregating 
its schools and housing a school desegregation plan went into 
effect in 1986 
sand later ordered the housing desegregation plan the city 
council defied him in august and was found in contempt paying out 
819000 in fines before capitulating to the threat of financial 
ruin and agreeing to carry out the plan 
appeals of sands ruling have failed the supreme court refused 
to hear the case 
sand had no comment on the suit according to his chambers 
jack otoole president of the save yonkers federation said the 
organization has received donations from all over the country and 
would take the case to the us supreme court if necessary

a senior soviet officer tuesday rejected 
as a propaganda ploy a nato report saying the warsaw pact 
massively outguns the western alliance in conventional arms 
this paper is not useful for the purpose of the future 
talks colgen nikolai chervov told a news conference 
he referred to planned talks on conventional stability in europe 
for which a mandate is being negotiated in vienna between the 16 
nato and seven warsaw pact nations 
natos 28page report was billed by secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner as an attempt to publicize relative eastwest troop 
strengths and challenge moscow to issue its data 
chervov said moscow would publish its own figures at an 
unspecified date after consulting warsaw pact allies 
woerner said the nato report conventional forces in europe the 
facts is not the basis for negotiators from the north atlantic 
treaty organization at the new conventional stability talks 
but chervov challenged this the study focuses on the ground and 
air forces to be discussed at those talks and ignores naval forces 
that are not at issue 
diplomats in vienna say they hope the talks which will cover the 
territory from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains will begin 
early next year 
the nato report did not discuss the quality of east bloc weapons 
and forces only their numbers 
it said warsaw pact nations have a large superiority in 11 major 
arms systems in eight of those the soviet union alone outguns all 
nato nations and its warsaw pact allies combined the report said 
as a military man chervov said he failed to understand the nato 
approach because the data provided do not make possible a real 
assessment of the fighting power of the two alliances 
he disputed figures on the east blocs capability and said the 
nato report erred in omitting the two military blocs naval forces 
in these areas the united states and the nato armed forces 
hold a multifaceted superiority including a 31 advantage in major 
combat ships cruisers cruise missiles and mine sweepers and a 
251 advantage in naval aircraft chervov said 
the nato paper is a propaganda ploy which cannot serve as a 
basis for future negotiations he said 
the talks are expected to replace deadlocked mutual and balanced 
force reduction talks on reducing troops in central europe 
negotiations for a conventional stability mandate have been upset 
by a dispute between france and the united states about whether 
talks should be limited to the 23 nato and warsaw pact nations or 
extended to include europes 12 neutral and nonaligned states 
yuri kashlev chief soviet delegate to the helsinki review 
conference told tuesdays news conference moscow is ready to 
include all its territory to the urals in the new talks 
he also said the soviets are ready to accept western suggestions 
that certain areas of turkey be excluded from the talks 
the issue of how much turkish territory to include and a us 
military base at adana in southern turkey is one of the last major 
stumbling blocks to eastwest agreement on a mandate both sides 
expect the dispute to be resolved

participants in a series of citizens 
assemblies held nationwide overwhelmingly favored cuts in defense 
spending and most also supported selected tax hikes and more money 
for education a public policy group reported tuesday 
results of discussions at 13 of the special seminars involving a 
crosssection of 1000 people were made public by the roosevelt 
center for american policy studies at a news conference tuesday the 
report a citizens agenda for the president was sent to 
presidentelect george bush last week 
this is something like an xray of what the american public 
might think if they really got into it and all the cards were on the 
table said michael higgens vice president of the roosevelt 
center which describes itself as a nonpartisan public institute 
set up to make representative democracy work 
the results which showed the federal budget deficit as the major 
concern among participants were obtained from forums held between 
sept 17 and nov 7 those attending were nearly all at least high 
school graduates but had a wide variety of backgrounds 
about half were democrats 30 percent republicans and the 
remainder described themselves as independents higgens said he 
said the center tried to make the groups as representative of all 
americans as possible but included only people who were willing to 
study 90 pages of objective briefing material and then participate 
in the daylong forums 
higgens acknowledged that the study could not be considered a 
scientific survey of public opinion but organizers believe it 
accurately reflects the opinions people would have if they bothered 
to inform themselves on national issues 
the assemblies are to meet again in may to assess bushs first 
100 days in office and draw up a more extensive report for the 
president 
on military spending 44 percent of participants supported a 3 
percent acrosstheboard cut and 46 percent supported a 10 percent 
cut among the least popular expenditures were aid to resistance 
fighters against communist regimes funds for antimissile defenses 
and money to build up of conventional or strategic forces 
in general foreign aid and defense programs were ranked at a 
lower priority than all domestic programs the report said 
seventy percent said foreign aid should be cut 57 percent wanted 
cuts in medicare payments to physicians and 52 percent said 
agricultural price supports could be reduced nearly all other 
suggested cuts in domestic programs received the support of less 
than half the participants 
to further fight the deficit 78 percent said tobacco wine and 
beer could be taxed at higher rates while 60 percent advocated a 
higher top personal income tax bracket of 33 percent and more than 
half said they would support higher user fees for government 
services and gasoline tax hikes twothirds also said business tax 
deductions could be limited and more than half advocated a higher 
top corporate tax bracket 
a majority of participants supported new federal spending on 
education energy environmental programs civilian research and 
development welfare reform and drug and crime prevention 
forums were held in peoria and chicago ill kalamazoo mich

the united states has proposed talks with 
vietnam regarding future cooperation in the search for american 
servicemen missing in action the state department said tuesday 
the talks would take place following a 10day joint search by 
four american and vietnamese teams that starts dec 5 said 
spokesman charles redman 
vietnam has agreed to a us request to have four teams conduct 
the search an increase from the two teams that were allowed to 
search various sites twice this year 
we hope that this will enable us to make more rapid progress in 
efforts to obtain the fullest possible accounting of those still 
missing in action redman said 
the us teams will consist of technical personnel from the joint 
casualty resolution center and the armys central identification 
laboratory in hawaii he said they will be investigating a number 
of cases in the areas of vinh and dong hoi south of hanoi 
we have proposed to the vietnamese to meet in hanoi following 
the conclusion of this activity dec 19 to 21 to conduct technical 
talks to review our joint activities to date and our future work 
program redman said we appreciate the increased cooperation of 
the government of vietnam in these efforts 
vietnam originally agreed to cooperate in the mia searches for a 
90day period starting sept 1 the proposed talks would focus on 
extending that period 
redman said the united states is hopeful that our joint 
cooperation will continue for as long as necessary to obtain the 
fullest possible accounting 
the united states says there are more than 2400 americans 
missing in action from the indochina war most of them in vietnam 
the united states has rejected demands from the impoverished 
asian country that cooperation on the mia issue be linked to the 
establishment of diplomatic links but it has allowed american 
charitable groups to provide prosthetics and medical care for 
handicapped children trade with vietnam is banned by law

a construction worker fell three stories 
and was impaled on a 6foot steel rod but that probably saved his 
life two doctors said 
the heavy rod kept jakie dale klaber from plunging six more 
floors to the ground when it pierced his belly and groin said drs 
tom harris and brian zachariah who treated klaber at the scene 
monday 
the rod basically arrested his fall said harris 
zachariah said that without the rod klaber would have 
definitely gone over 
harris said klaber was lucid enough to answer routine questions 
about his medical history 
given the circumstances he was relatively calm zachariah 
said 
firefighters cut the bar of concrete reinforcing rod and with 
the rod still imbedded in klabers body lowered him to the ground 
in a basket 
the rod was removed in surgery at humana hospitaluniversity of 
louisville 
klaber 50 was in serious condition tuesday with facial 
abdominal and groin injuries following the accident at a parking 
garage being built by the whittenberg engineering and construction 
co 
witnesses and a whittenberg vice president said klaber was 
operating a crane from inside a control cab on top of the ninestory 
building he was hoisting a halfton wooden concreteform panel when 
a wind gust apparently blew the 8by12foot form into the wooden 
cab knocking it and klaber over the edge 
my first thought was that the crane killed the man in the 
box said jefferson circuit judge ken corey who watched from the 
nearby hall of justice i could see that guy inside as it headed 
down 
still inside the control cab klaber fell headfirst 36 feet to 
the sixthfloor parking deck which juts out farther than the top 
three floors he fell almost vertically onto the steel rod located 
within two feet of the garages edge 
the rod passed through some fat on klabers abdomen and part of 
his groin said dr donald thomas director of universitys 
emergency room

freeways in southern san diego county 
increasingly are becoming deathtraps for illegal aliens who try to 
cross them at night on their journey north the california highway 
patrol says 
in four years 56 undocumented aliens have been killed on 
interstate 805 and interstate 5 within four miles of the usmexico 
border when they tried to beat traffic across up to eight lanes 
officials said ten have died in the last month 
more people have been killed on those small stretches of freeway 
than any comparable road elsewhere in the country said capt lee 
denno of the chps san diego office 
lets say these were all american motorists that were struck 
and killed denno said in an interview published monday in the 
tribune of san diego i think the media in the us and san diego 
in particular would jump right on this and through the use of 
tremendous media exposure this would become an issue everyone would 
jump on 
groups would be formed and things would happen something would 
be done 
but because the victims are not us citizens he said no one 
has taken the lead in seeking a solution 
they dont have any real spokesperson denno said thats 
probably why there is no hue and cry to do something about this 
problem 
denno said he started keeping track of alien pedestrian 
fatalities on the freeways after becoming commander of the san diego 
area highway patrol in february 1986 he said he learned there were 
seven in 1985 and the toll has increased over the years 
smugglers hired to guide aliens often lead a group of 12 or so at 
a time across a highway they usually try to cross in single file 
the first people to cross will look and see that it is 
reasonably safe for them to cross and they will start running 
denno said usually it is the people at the end of the line that 
get struck and killed 
many illegal aliens also are unfamilar with the speed of american 
traffic because they come from remote or undeveloped regions 
officials said 
the drivers involved are almost never cited because the accidents 
are considered unavoidable officials said 
several officials from various agencies including the chp the 
state department of transportation the us border patrol and the 
san diego police department have met informally to discuss the 
situation 
options that have been discussed include putting up signs to 
alert drivers that people might be crossing the freeway reducing 
the speed limit near the border and installing lights for better 
roadway illumination 
enforcement of a reduced speed limit would be difficult at best 
officials said 
of the warning signs denno said thats something thats never 
been done before but it is something that will probably be 
considered down the road you dont usually put signs on a freeway 
to warn motorists of things that arent supposed to be there in the 
first place

the only us plant which makes a critical 
component of nuclear weapons wont be able to resume production 
until at least next spring or summer because of persistent safety 
concerns energy secretary john s herring said monday 
just last month energy department officials said their savannah 
river plant near aiken s c would begin a phased restart of its 
k reactor in december and that it could resume production of 
tritium in january none of the three reactors at savannah river has 
produced weapons material since last april 
we are hoping to start the k reactor in the spring summer 
herrington said in an interview with the associated press we are 
not going to start up or operate a reactor that we are not satisfied 
is totally safe 
since october engineers with the energy department and the 
operating contractor the ei du pont de nemours amp co have been 
developing much more stringent operating and safety criteria 
were not slipping we are using more caution ok herrington 
said in the interview 
i am satisfied with the progress i think our startup 
criteria our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well i 
do not want to put a predicted date on the startup said 
herrington 
as we proceed toward startup we want to make sure that 
everything is right i dont want to have an arbitrary date of 
december and then find out that all of the procedures are not in 
place i am now saying spring because i now think that is a 
reasonable date it may be that when we get to spring that it wont 
be til summer i dont see it going much farther than that he 
said 
the three reactors at savannah river are the only operational 
facilities in the united states capable of producing two critical 
nuclear weapons materials tritium and plutonium herrington has 
told congress that the united states is awash in plutonium 
tritium decays at the rate of 55 percent per year and 
administration and congressional sources say stockpiles will be 
depleted badly within six months to two years although the exact 
numbers are classified tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons 
asked when tritium would be in critical short supply herrington 
said i think we are ok with spring and summer but declined to 
give an exact date 
herrington listed these new safety measures for savannah river 
requiring the shift superviser to have an engineering degree 
officials at savannah river say that nine out of the 12 shift 
supervisers hold degrees and the gap can be closed by reassigning 
engineers from other duties 
adding more technical support on each shift 
using a fiveshift rotation for key operations workers one more 
shift than before freeing an entire shift for training at any given 
time this will double the hours each shift spends per year on a 
computer simulator 
completing seismic reviews and modifications necessary to assure 
the ability of safety systems to shut down the reactor remove decay 
heat and monitor conditions 
increase energy department headquarters oversight and approval 
of key startup procedures 
both dupont and the energy department are beefing up their 
management and oversight of the savannah river plant officials say 
for the first time federal officials will be stationed directly at 
each reactor rather than at the regional headquarters which is 
located at one edge of the sprawling 300squaremile complex 
dupont which agreed to run savannah river in 1950 at the 
personal request of president harry s truman is turning the 
operating contract over to the westinghouse corp starting april 1 
dupont has reassigned the senior official in charge of reactor 
operations to savannah river from company headquarters in 
wilmington del 500 miles away when the contract changes hands 
the duties of 500 other key engineers who had been in wilmington 
will be moved to aiken 
herrington said that beause of the changes savannah river and 
other nuclear weapons facilities will emerge as a stronger 
complex 
he initiated a review of the 17 major weapons facilities shortly 
after taking office in february 1985 he said and began a reform 
campaign shortly thereafter creating a new post of assistant 
secretary for safety health and environment with the power to shut 
down plants 
after three mile island a partial meltdown of a pennsylvania 
utility reactor in march 1979 the commercial nuclear power 
industry got its act together but the government procedures 
policies plans did not keep pace he said 
a legitimate case can be made that some of our reactors 
were being run with a prethree mile island mentality he said 
tighter oversight and monitoring are needed he said to bring us 
up to the level of training and operation that the commerical sector 
has attained

nazi camp survivors are ready to 
testify against an elderly man alleged to be one of 10 mostwanted 
war criminals if argentina upholds his extradition to west germany 
officials said tuesday 
west german prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for former 
ss capt josef schwammberger accused of killing thousands of people 
while he was commander of nazi labor camps in poland during world 
war ii 
an argentine judge on monday ordered that schwammberger arrested 
a year ago in a remote village be extradited to west germany 
shwammbergers lawyers say they will appeal the extradition order 
schwammberger 76 has been a fugitive since he disappeared from a 
train in 1948 while being taken from germany to american military 
authorities in austria to be tried according to renowned nazi 
hunter simon wiesenthal 
prosecutors allege the former ss commander was responsible for 
the deaths of more than 5000 people mostly jews camp survivors 
have testified that he shot to death starving prisoners or set dogs 
on them 
he was a sadist an evil person said edward blonder of 
florida who testified at a argentine deportation hearing in july 
along with two other survivors of the przemysl and mielec labor 
camps 
stuttgart prosecutor helmut krombacher said witnesses from two 
continents are expected to testify against schwammberger if he goes 
to trial in west germany 
testimony has been taken from witnesses in the united states 
israel and argentina krombacher said many witnesses will be 
available 
wiesenthal said dozens of labor camp survivors are anxious to 
recount what they saw schwammberger do to prisoners 
these are all firstclass witnesses wiesenthal said in a 
telephone interview from vienna 
he said the witnesses are living in the united states israel 
denmark and austria 
schwammberger had been a member of the gestapo the nazis secret 
police in innsbruck wiesenthal said 
the former ss commander was arrested in austria just after the 
end of the war in 1945 and a large quantity of valuables were 
confiscated from him wiesenthal said 
authorities found a large number of rings gold watches 
jewelry and diamonds taken from victims in the labor camps said 
wiesenthal who had been tracking schwammberger for four decades 
the nazi hunter said he learned in 1971 that schwammberger was 
living in la plata argentina and informed prosecutors in stuttgart 
but schwammberger was apparently tipped off and fled before 
argentine police could arrest him wiesenthal said 
schwammbergers name was on a list of 10 mostwanted nazi war 
criminals published in 1987 by the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles 
the list appeared in argentine newspapers and authorities were 
tipped off about schwammbergers whereabouts wiesenthal said 
schwammberger was arrested on nov 13 1987 in huerta grande a 
village about 500 miles northwest of buenos aires since then he 
has been jailed in la plata about 30 miles south of the capital 
argentine officials said they learned schwammberger arrived in 
argentina in 1949 and worked for a chemical company for many years

losses in the savings and loan industry shrank 
by 60 percent in the third quarter reflecting rescues of insolvent 
institutions that transferred the red ink to the governments books 
a top regulator said tuesday 
federal home loan bank board chairman m danny wall in a 
luncheon meeting with reporters also hinted at his agencys 
recommendation for reshaping the federal rescue effort 
wall said the nations 3028 federally insured sampls lost 152 
billion in the julyseptember period down from a revised 382 
billion in the second quarter and 393 billion in the first three 
months of the year 
earlier this month bank board economist james barth predicted 
third quarter losses would narrow to about 2 billion the second 
quarter loss had previously been reported at 36 billion 
the industrys earnings from current operations rose from 224 
million in the second quarter to 364 million in the third 
nonoperating losses reflecting mostly writeoffs of loans already 
gone bad shrank from 350 billion to 131 billion 
bank board member lawrence white said operating profits would 
continue in the fourth quarter but said the chances of the industry 
posting an overall profit depended on how many bad loans remain to 
be written off 
a complete report on the industrys performance through sept 30 
is not due out until dec 14 
the 927 billion loss for the first nine months up from 78 
billion for all of last year is the industrys worst since the 
depression 
wall attributed the partial stemming of the red ink last quarter 
to the more than 140 closings and forced mergers of failed sampls he 
said the bank board hopes to have handled 200 by the end of the year 
some analysts and members of congress have criticized the deals 
because the bank board in many cases agrees to absorb much of the 
rescued institutions future losses they say losses continue to 
mount although the losses dont show up on the industrys books 
meanwhile wall said the bank board next month will forward to 
the treasury department its recommendation on how to structure the 
continued cleanup of the sampl industry 
wall said the proposal being discussed is similar to this years 
bailout of the farm credit system that provides for taxpayers 
through the treasury to pay the interest on bonds sold to raise 
bailout money it also establishes a special board including the 
treasury secretary to oversee expenditure of bailout funds 
what we have on the agenda isnt far from that wall said he 
declined to elaborate 
treasury spokesman arthur siddon said the departments sampl plan 
would not be released for at least several weeks he said the 
department still was trying to arrive at a firm estimate of the size 
of the problem projected at between 50 billion and 100 billion by 
various analysts 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures commercial banks was expected during a speech 
on wednesday to present his agencys recommendation for cleaning up 
sampls 
on another topic wall said he would like to remain as bank board 
chairman in the next administration but has not yet been approached 
by aides to presidentelect george bush

an interview their newspaper said tuesday 
zimbabwes stateowned mass media trust and one of its newspapers 
which employs the two announced they will not report on the 
governors actions until the safety of their reporters is guaranteed 
president robert mugabe called a news conference to say he was 
awaiting an official report 
we cannot act on the basis of newspaper reports he said 
the right way is really for those who have been assaulted to 
make out a case 
journalist gibbs dube and chauffeur phillip maseko of the 
chronicle published in bulawayo made formal allegations to police 
that matabeleland gov mark dube chased them in his station wagon 
seized their car keys and forcibly escorted them to his home sunday

punched them and threatened to shoot them with a pistol this 
occurred after interviewing the governor at his residence about gold 
mining operations 
dube unrelated to the governor escaped from the residence at 
esigodini near bulawayo while the governor allegedly was beating the 
driver 
maseko was held more than two hours before the governor drove him 
to a nearby police station and ordered his detention 
police freed maseko five hours later after deciding they had no 
grounds to hold him 
i did not try to escape because i feared i would be shot 
maseko told his paper 
deputy police commissioner douglas chingoka broke an official 
silence on the affair to criticize police officers he said he would 
punish esigodini policemen if they unlawfully detained the driver 
zimbabwe newspapers ltd owners of the chronicle and all 
zimbabwes other daily and sunday newspapers condemned what it 
called brutal unprovoked and premeditated attacks 
this is an example of jungle law which zimbabwe should not 
tolerate from its leaders said group chief executive elias 
rusike if the governor were not punished zimbabwe may be 
entering a new frightening era where the rights of ordinary citizens 
are trampled underfoot willynilly by those in authority 
the chronicle recently has won popular acclaim for exposing cases 
of alleged official corruption including a report charging gov 
dube illegally grazes cattle on state land 
the governor has made no official comment when he was questioned 
sunday by the chronicle he reportedly said the reporter was held 
because he did not have proper identification 
of the driver who still was being detained at the governors 
residence dube was quoted as saying you can write what you want 
but i am going to work on this guy

a teenage suspect in the slaying of a 
college student was found hanged in the woods tuesday a month after 
his disappearance frightened residents and forced police to curtail 
halloween celebrations 
the body of mark branch 19 was found around 8 am by hunter 
kevin purrington of buckland as he stalked two deer in the woods of 
hog mountain 
i heard something snap up above purrington said i looked 
up and i saw the body i made it down that mountain in record 
time 
the spot was about a mile from the road where branchs car was 
found oct 25 the day a search warrant was issued for his arrest in 
the stabbing death of sharon gregory 18 
branch was identified through a wallet found on his body 
franklin county district attorney judd carhart said at a news 
conference 
carhart said branch and gregory were acquaintances he called the 
slaying an extremely violent murder involving numerous stab 
wounds 
the cause of branchs death was tentatively ruled a suicide and 
tests were being conducted to determine how long branch had been 
dead carhart said he said the body appeared partially decomposed 
and he believed the youth had died weeks ago 
he declined to speculate on a motive for the slaying or the 
evidence that had led police to suspect branch as the killer 
that is a matter and will always be a matter of conjecture 
carhart said this chapter of this tragedy is terminated there 
are no further suspects and the case is closed 
branch was the subject of intensive searches with dogs and 
helicopters while rumors terrified the town of 18000 people in 
northwestern massachusetts 
the body of gregory a greenfield community college freshman had 
been discovered oct 24 by her twin sister in the bathtub of their 
greenfield home 
as halloween approached community nervousness was increased by 
reports that branch was a fan of horror movies particularly the 
friday the 13th series in which the character jason slashes his 
victims 
at the urging of town officials greenfield held the traditional 
trickortreating for children a day early and limited it to 
daylight hours 
concern flared again in early november when a buckland home was 
burglarized three miles from where branchs car had been spotted and 
the only items taken were food winter clothes ad a knife 
police from new hampshire to connecticut said they received 
reports of possible sightings of the young man who had worked as a 
grocery store clerk 
on nov 14 and 15 a team from harvard medical schools crisis 
management group met with teenagers and parents in greenfield and 
surrounding towns in an attempt to calm fears

minority leader bob dole overwhelmingly 
endorsed tuesday to continue as the senates republican leader for 
another two years seems an unlikely water carrier for the new 
presidentelect george bush 
himself a defeated presidential candidate dole has some of his 
own ideas on one of the most serious problem facing bush reducing 
the federal budget deficit and the two dont always coincide 
and despite a couple of public attempts to gloss over the wounds 
from this years campaign the hurt from that bruising contest will 
be slow to heal 
we are ready to go to work with a new administration dole 
said tuesday after winning uncontested another twoyear stint as 
gop senate leader the election is over he won fair and square 
unlike bush who was born into a wealthy eastern family dole 
clawed his way to the top of politics from a middleclass background 
in tiny russell kan bush went to yale while dole attended 
washburn municipal university in topeka the class differences have 
aggravated the two mens rivalry 
but both also are pragmatists with the congress now even more 
firmly in democratic control than before the election cooperation 
and compromise will be the republicans only keys to success 
dole now will have to forge a working relationship with his new 
democratic counterpart maine sen george mitchell who was selected 
as majority leader 
although often partisan and acerbic in his rhetoric and with a 
biting wit dole has become best known as a crafter of consensus 
since he became party leader in 1984 work it out has been his 
motto 
with the reagan administration dole sought where possible to be 
the administrations policy point man he did it with particular 
enthusiasm on issues like judicial appointments and aid to the 
nicaraguan contras 
but he also was capable of independence particularly where he 
deemed it important to protect gop senators political interests in 
1988 dole supported reagans position on just 68 percent of floor 
votes placing him about in the middle of the republican pack on 
that measure 
dole 65 suffered machine gun wounds during world war ii combat 
in italy that rendered his right arm useless the affliction has 
engendered in dole support for programs to aid the handicapped and 
the poor 
he was first elected to the senate in 1968 following service in 
the house his wife elizabeth served as president reagans 
transportation secretary before resigning to join doles 
presidential campaign

an exconvict released from prison ahead of schedule 
because of overcrowding was charged with firstdegree murder tuesday 
in the deaths of two police officers allegedly shot with their own 
guns 
charles harry street 34 of boynton beach was ordered held 
without bond on two murder counts by a dade county judge 
street was arrested early monday an hour after police said he 
disarmed two metrodade officers richard boles 41 and david 
strzalkowski 34 they were shot in the head and shoulders over 
their bulletproof vests 
authorities said street then stole a patrol car and traded it for 
another vehicle stolen at gunpoint in neighboring broward county

street had been released from prison only 10 days before the 
shootings after serving eight years of a 15year attempted murder 
sentence for shooting a man outside a bar he has a 20page criminal 
record that includes numerous charges of assaulting police officers 
corrections officials said street served more time than average 
for a 15year sentence because of frequent infractions in prison 
but they also said he got out nearly two years earlier than he 
otherwise would have because of overcrowing in florida prisons 
how could a prison system be so wrong in their profile of this 
individual asked lisa strachan wife of the oakland park police 
chief and member of a group calling for harsher penalties for 
attacks on officers how could a file contain 20 pages of a rap 
sheet and not tell the probation and parole department that this 
isnt a standard model citizen 
in 1980 alone street was arrested seven times three times on 
charges of assaulting officers while free on bond on the attempted 
murder charge in palm beach county his record indicates 
palm beach county state attorney david bludworth said more must 
be done to stop releasing people like him 
we cannot use overcrowding as an excuse to continually release 
dangerous people that will commit crimes against our innocent 
citizens said bludworth 
but metrodade police director fred taylor refuses to blame 
corrections officials for his officers deaths im sure they did 
not know when he was released from prison that he was violent he 
said 
so far this year five south florida officers have been shot to 
death four of them in dade county counting the two officers slain

the fbi is proposing to hire 
spanishspeaking linguists and to bolster its equal employment 
opportunity office as part of a damages package for hispanic agents 
who won a racial discrimination suit against the agency 
the 311 hispanic agents who sued are being asked to respond to 
the proposals by dec 15 the damages must be approved by us 
district judge lucias bunton in el paso 
in papers filed monday with bunton the hispanic agents asked the 
court to assess damages according to a formula they devised while 
the fbi asked they be considered on a casebycase basis 
in a sept 30 decision bunton supported hispanic agents 
contention that the fbi had discriminated against them in job 
conditions assignments and promotions 
bunton suggested then that the fbi pay court costs pay 
spanishspeaking agents more for the specialized work they do and 
improve the promotion system and the equal employment opportunity 
process in which discrimination complaints are made 
under the fbis proposal agency equal employment opportunity 
counselors would receive better training and the office would be 
supervised by an executive assistant fbi director 
the fbi also promised to hire at least 30 spanishspeaking 
linguists to monitor wiretaps and to pay agents bonuses for 
improving foreignlanguage fluency 
the hispanic agents had complained they were unfairly burdened 
with undesirable wiretaps and dangerous assignments because of their 
appearance and spanishspeaking ability they contended that 
nonhispanic agents who spoke spanish were given better assignments 
the fbi also said back pay might be due some agents and proposed 
having plaintiffs fill out a long forms to determine whether they 
should receive back pay and how much 
but the plaintiffs represented by attorneys hugo rodriguez and 
antonio silva said such a process would require separate hearings 
on each plaintiff they proposed a formula to determine how much pay 
each plaintiff gets based on tenure employment status and salary 
bunton set the dec 15 deadline for the plaintiffs to reply the 
fbi has until dec 30 to counter that response 
the classaction lawsuit was filed in january 1987 by bernardo 
matias mat perez the secondincommand in the el paso office 
and at the time the highestranking hispanic fbi agent

an organization opposed to reagan 
administration policy in central america filed suit against the fbi 
on tuesday seeking to seal files compiled during the bureaus 
antiterrorism probe of the private group 
the classaction lawsuit alleges that during the march 1983june 
1985 probe the fbi spread false information about the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador linking it to terrorism 
and hurting its efforts to raise money and enroll new members 
the cispes lawsuit filed in us district court seeks an order 
preventing the fbi from using records gathered during the probe and 
requiring the bureau to seal the files and deposit them in the 
national archives 
fbi director william sessions told the group in a letter two 
weeks ago that the bureau would consider expunging the records of 
individuals who believe they are named in the investigation and who 
request such action 
margaret ratner a lawyer at the center for constitutional rights 
which helped cispes file the suit said the group is willing to 
continue discussions with the fbi on the matter while the suit is 
pending 
the bureau following a review by the justice department ended 
the cispes investigation after failing to establish any substantial 
link between cispes and international terrorism sessions said in 
september that the probe had been too broad and he disciplined half 
a dozen fbi personnel for mishandling it 
director sessions explained the investigation by saying that it 
was an aberration said ratner how can an investigation of such 
massive scope be an aberration it was the work of scores of fbi 
offices around the country 
the suit alleges that the names of hundreds of people involved 
with cispes or other groups investigated in 178 spinoff 
investigations are contained in several government computer 
databanks including the terrorist information system 
many of the names also have been disseminated to military 
intelligence agencies as well as the state department the suit said 
one of the plaintiffs catherine cornell of cincinnati a 
graduate student at xavier university said she is concerned she 
will have difficulties in her teaching career because her name is in 
fbi files from the cispes probe 
ms cornell said she may be saddled with the unfounded and unfair 
stigma of who would hire a terrorist she and her husband paul 
knitter who teaches theology at xavier have traveled to nicaragua 
and oppose the administrations central american policies but they 
are not cispes members 
ms cornell said a colleague of her husbands told her that the 
fbi had visited him at xavier in may 1987 two years after the 
cispes probe ended and wanted to know about knitters reputation on 
campus and what he was teaching 
mike lent of the cispes national office said the group has gotten 
letters from contributors saying they would no longer donate money 
to the group because they were afraid their names would turn up in 
fbi files 
some private organizations have said they had concerns about 
working with us because of the fact we were under fbi 
investigation said lent 
the suit said that although the investigation ended in 1985 
information supporting the probes validity was disseminated during 
a february 1988 appearance before the senate intelligence committee 
by the fbis oliver revell 
the suit also said a newspaper article last june quoted sessions 
as saying there had been a sufficient basis for the probe in 
september however after an internal fbi review of how the probe 
was conducted sessions said the basis for the probe was information 
provided by an informant who proved to be unreliable

the soviet unions call for a common european 
home shared by the east and west is merely an attempt to preserve 
soviet dominance over eastern europe president reagans national 
security adviser said tuesday 
in a speech prepared for a conference of the institute for 
foreign policy analysis army lt gen colin l powell said soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev should be praised for seeking reform 
in his country 
but at the same time powell noting the 40th anniversary of the 
north atlantic treaty alliance in 1989 said this is no time for the 
west to let down its guard 
as an example he cited what gorbachev had proposed as a new 
structure in europe in which all nations east and west can 
live in peace and harmony 
the soviets assure us that there would be room in this house 
for the united states and canada as well powell said we 
appreciate the assurance but we did not ask for it nor do we need 
it we are in europe not at the invitation of the soviet union but 
in alliance with our western allies 
powell who likely will be returning to fulltime duty in the 
army when reagans term ends jan 20 asked his audience to consider 
what lies behind the soviet call for a common european home 
as i see it it is an attempt to tie the future to the past to 
freeze the european status quo he said powell acknowledged 
that his conclusion may seem odd given the soviet 
pronouncements about a new era of political thinking embraced in 
such terms of glasnost and perestroika 
but powell said he believes nevertheless that the soviet 
proposal is an idea wedded to the past 
forty years after the soviets imposed their presence in the 
middle of europe he said the citizens of these countries still 
look to the west as their historical cultural and political 
homeland their ferment today is a testament to the strength and 
durability of these aspirations 
he also said the soviets have rushed to construct a new home 
for all of us because the european allies of the united states 
have at last moved to construct a european pillar of strength 
challenging the soviet goal of predominant power on the continent 
if we analyze what this sovietbuilt home would contain he 
said we find some very old ideas indeed unbalanced disarmament 
proposals dissolution of military alliances removal of foreign 
bases and acceptance yes acceptance of the ideological division 
of europe presently enforced by soviet power

george mitchell the new senate majority 
leader first drew the nations attention when he looked lt col 
oliver l north in the eye and told him he had no monopoly on 
loyalty 
please remember that it is possible for an american to 
disagree with you on aid to the contras and still love god and 
still love this country just as much as you do mitchell told the 
fervent marine officer at the nationally televised irancontra 
hearings 
although that moment represented something of a national debut 
for the maine democrat he had already made himself a hero among 
fellow party members 
mitchell as chairman of the senate democratic campaign 
committee helped engineer the 1986 comeback that saw democrats 
regain control of the senate which they had lost in president 
reagans 1980 landslide 
his reward instant clout on the democratic side of the aisle and 
appointment as the senates deputy president pro tempore an 
unexciting post but an important measure of the esteem in which he 
was held by his colleagues 
now after an intensive backroom campaign launched after sen 
robert c byrd dwva announced last april he would step aside as 
majority leader mitchell has defeated two more senior colleagues to 
take the prize 
the losers were sens daniel k inouye dhawaii and j bennett 
johnston dla 
mitchells elevation to the senates top leadership post gives 
him control of the chambers agenda as the 101st congress begins its 
work and as presidentelect george bush launches his administration 
it marks a new begining after byrds long tenure as party leader 
and many senate democrats hope mitchell can use it to project a 
positive forwardlooking image for their party in the wake of three 
successive defeats for the presidency he has vowed to share his 
authority with colleagues saying i do not intend to be a oneman 
band 
sen wyche fowler dga said he told his colleagues inside the 
democratic caucus that mitchell has the ability to create an 
atmosphere of calm statesmanship that reaches beyond the 
prejudices of regionalism the ability to achieve a truly 
national consensus on policies that reject the easy answers 
mitchell 55 who has been active in maines democratic politics 
since 1968 is a protege of sen edmund s muskie dmaine whom he 
served as administrative assistant in the early 1960s 
after a number of political setbacks including defeat in a bid 
for governor in 1974 mitchell with muskies backing was appointed 
first as us attorney for maine then as a federal district judge 
a lifetime appointment 
in 1980 when muskie resigned from the senate to become secretary 
of state he recommended to maines democratic governor that he 
appoint mitchell to fill the vacancy 
two years later mitchell won the seat in his own right by a 
commanding 61 percent of the vote he won a second term this year by 
an even more impressive 81 percent 
in the senate mitchell compiled a largely liberal voting record 
and became a champion of the environment especially in the battle 
against acid rain and was an early and outspoken critic of reagan 
administration environmental policies 
as chairman of the finance committees health panel he is an 
advocate for a major longterm health care plan 
on the veterans affairs committee mitchell backed successful 
1984 legislation to help vietnam veterans cope with diseases 
believed to be caused by exposure to the herbicide agent orange 
as a member of the senate irancontra committee mitchell was a 
steady quiet lawyerlike questioner 
but as the hearings went on he became an increasingly outspoken 
critic of those inside the reagan administration who he said had 
subverted the authority of the president and the constitution by 
selling arms to iran and arranging for the diversion of part of the 
proceeds to nicaraguas antileftist contra rebels 
in his address to north and the public watching on television 
mitchell invoked the memory of his immigrant mother and laborer 
father and the emotions he said he felt when as a federal judge he 
conferred citizenship on immigrants 
he told north that when he asked new immigrants why they wished 
to live in the united states many of them said the reason was that 
in america you can criticize the government without looking over 
your shoulder 
thats what democracy is all about the senator said the 
freedom to disagree with the government 
mitchells father was a utility company laborer who later worked 
as a janitor his mother an immigrant from lebanon worked at a 
wool mill in waterville maine where the family lived 
mitchell who plays skillful cribbage and competitive tennis is 
a 1954 graduate of bowdoin college in maine and earned a law degree 
from georgetown university law school in 1960 he was divorced last 
year after 27 years of marriage his daughter andrea is a social 
worker who lives in massachusetts

us corporations reported a slight 02 percent 
increase in profits in the julyseptember quarter after posting a 
large gain in the previous threemonth period the government said 
tuesday 
the commerce department said thirdquarter profits after taxes 
rose 400 million to 1631 billion the worst showing since a 25 
percent loss in the final quarter of 1987 
robert dederick an economist with northern trust co in chicago 
said profits are in part rebounding from the unusually strong 89 
percent increase in the second quarter but he said earnings also 
were hurt because inflation is forcing companies to pay more for 
labor and materials 
they werent able to pass on those cost increases that occurred 
this is a profit squeeze he said if it continues it could 
cut into us corporations strong spending to upgrade equipment and 
expand production 
corporate cash flows a measure intended to show the funds 
corporations have available for investment fell 07 percent in the 
third quarter following a 14 percent rise in the apriljune period 
however if unemployment remains low dederick said corporations 
likely will succeed in raising prices to customers and profits will 
rebound he said 
corporate profits before taxes were up 06 percent in the third 
quarter to 3077 billion following a 69 percent increase in the 
previous threemonth period 
dividend payments to stockholders rose 25 percent to 1057 
billion in the third quarter up from a 18 percent gain in the 
second quarter

the pilot of a delta air lines jetliner that 
crashed aug 31 killing 14 people testified tuesday that some 
rules might have been bent in readying the boeing 727 for takeoff 
but that preparations were adequate 
larry davis admitted seeming deviations from the rules under 
questioning by aerospace engineer jeff gorney as the national 
transportation safety board opened an inquiry into the crash on 
takeoff at dallas international airport ninetyfour people survived 
for instance the delta veteran of 23 years said he had used hand 
signals instead of calling out completion of each item on the 
preflight checklist and had made a takeoff briefing at the gate 
instead of on the runway 
i like to get as much done as possible before we get into the 
position of getting rushed said davis 
gorney also said a flight attendant was allowed into the cockpit 
when the jet was waiting to take off despite an federal aviation 
administration rule requiring a sterile cockpit once the plane 
has left the gate 
but he noted that the plane was waiting in a line of traffic 
and added i dont believe it was a critical phase of flight but 
technically it was in violation 
the faa requires pilots to go through a checklist but does not 
specifically require a verbal a challenge and response between 
pilots the agency however has made clear on many occasions that 
such an exchange is preferable 
according to ntsb documents delta procedures aug 31 only 
suggested a verbal exchange during some phases of the checklist 
faa recently chastised delta for inadequate cockpit discipline 
and poor coordination and communications among pilots and delta has 
said that it will formalize the checklist process with increased 
emphasis on verbal challenges 
delta procedures say the preflight briefing should take place 
before takeoff but also says it could begin during the before 
start check which normally occurs about five minutes before the 
plane pushes back from the gate 
davis testified that he went to full power as soon as he felt 
engine compressor stalls unlike any he had ever felt before 
it was like driving a car 60 mph down the highway and driving 
into a water puddle it was pronounced deceleration davis he said 
under questioning from a representative of pratt amp whitney 
manufacturer of the airplanes engines 
investigators have ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of the 
stalls and have focused instead on the position of the wing flaps 
which the ntsb said were found retracted instead of extended for 
takeoff in the wreckage 
the wing flap lever in the cockpit was in the wrong position 
after the crash the board said but in the cockpit recording the 
copilot can be heard saying 15 15 green light before takeoff 
to verify the flaps proper deployment 
davis said tuesday he did not know if the other crew members 
might have touched the flap handle as the plane was in trouble 
i was too busy flying the plane i wouldnt have seen it he 
said 
a pilots union contends a split flap configuration may have 
occurred placing one flap up and one down the union contends that 
in that case the takeoff warning system of the 727 would not 
necessarily alert the crew of the danger 
the air line pilots association has accused the ntsb of making a 
premature finding of pilot error 
air line pilots association spokesman john mazor listening to 
davis testimony said it is standard for pilots with davis 
experience to deviate slightly from procedures 
there are reams and reams of manuals and regulations it would 
be impossible to remember them all mazor said 
fourteen of the 108 people on board died the threeman flight 
crew was among the survivors 
its fortunate the crew is alive thats not always the case 
were very hopeful the crew will be able to provide assistance where 
in other crashes theres no surviving crew ntsb spokesman mike 
benson said before the hearing

nasa forged ahead tuesday with the 
countdown for the secret mission of space shuttle atlantis despite a 
forecast for unacceptably high wind and rain showers at launch time 
because of the forecast for thursday morning liftoff shuttle 
managers said they would meet again wednesday for a more uptodate 
look at the situation the five astronauts on atlantis are to 
release a huge spy satellite in orbit 
otherwise said the top level nasa mission management team 
preparations for launch are going very well 
the managers said in a statement they werent concerned by one 
lingering problem a leaking tire on the shuttles main landing gear 
the leak rate was 17 pounds per square inch a day on a tire that 
on tuesday held 333 pounds the agency said at that rate the 
pressure would remain high enough for a week more on the launch pad 
the tire must have at least 275 psi when the spacecraft lands at 
edwards air force base 
technicians cant reach the tire which is filled with gaseous 
nitrogen while the landing gear doors are closed a refill would 
require rolling the shuttle back to its hangar and separating it 
from the external fuel tank a process that would take weeks 
the upcoming launch is being treated with as much secrecy as 
possible and the air force has said only that it is scheduled for 
thursday between 632 am and 932 am est the precise time will 
be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff the big countdown 
clocks at the site were kept blank 
despite the hushed atmosphere much is known about atlantis 
mission the astronauts will release a 500 million satellite the 
first of a series called lacrosse that can discern targets of 
military interest in 80 percent of the soviet union 
once they have released the satellite dropping it overboard 
using the shuttles robot crane atlantis will hover nearby to make 
sure everything works if it doesnt the astronauts will retrieve 
the lacrosse and bring it back to earth 
nasa said there was a 70 percent probability that the weather 
will be below the strict limits laid down since the challenger 
explosion jan 28 1986 that claimed seven lives 
those rules include winds of less than 19 mph from the south or 
28 mph from any direction no rain at the pad or in the flight path 
and no thunderstorms within five miles 
the forecast was for winds of 15 to 28 mph three layers of 
clouds and isolated showers 
the flight will be the third shuttle mission dedicated to the 
military and the second flight since the challenger disaster no 
details will be released during the flight unless something goes 
wrong with the spacecraft the other allmilitary flights were in 
1985 
the crew will be navy cmdr robert l gibson spaceship 
commander air force lt col guy s gardner pilot and mission 
specialists col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross of 
the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
gibson and gardner practiced the landings they would have to make 
on the kennedy space center runway in case of engine failure 
rehearsing the steep descents in an airplane built to handle like a 
shuttle all five astronauts then were given medical examinations

world bank president barber b conable on 
tuesday denounced trade barriers that prevent third world nations 
from selling their goods in the united states and other industrial 
countries 
conable said aid to third world countries was only half as much 
as they could earn if they were permitted to sell their goods freely 
to the donor countries 
if you were to eliminate all international aid and all 
tradedistorting obstacles you would have twice as a good a 
situation in terms of resource transfers for the developing world as 
youve got now he said 
conable estimated the annual value of aid from all industrial 
countries at 35 billion a year while their trade barriers 
prevented exports to them worth 60 billion that was only the 
primary effect of the barriers because additional trade would 
stimulate third world growth he added 
the caribbean countries alone have lost three quarters over 
250 million worth of their annual sugar exports to the united 
states he said 
in 1987 the us imposed antidumping actions on carnations to 
limit imports from mexico costa rica ecuador and chile all four 
exported only 16 million worth of cut flowers to the us during 
that same year they paid almost 150 times that amount in interest to 
us commercial creditors he in a statement he will submit next 
week in montreal to a meeting of cabinet members of nearly 100 
governments the session will review progress toward dismantling 
trade barriers 
conable distributed blame widely 
he noted that west european countries became the worlds biggest 
exporters of beef and wheat while the share of the market supplied 
by argentina and uruguay two of the lowest cost producers dropped 
sharply he said the high price paid for rice to japanese farmers 
five times the world level closed off sales by thailand and 
pakistan 
the third worlds 12 trillion debt is not up for discussion in 
montreal but conable said it clearly is related to trade since 
whatever may be done about debt the third world will need to sell 
more goods 
three years ago thentreasury secretary james a baker iii 
proposed additional lending to third world countries to help them 
grow out of their problems little additional lending has been 
forthcoming more recently baker whom presidentelect george bush 
has tapped as his secretary of state has been promoting a menu of 
options under which debt may be reduced by agreement between 
creditor banks and debtor governments 
youre getting an evolution of the socalled baker plan 
conable said 
the world bank is the biggest source of international aid the 
bank owned by 151 countries lends the third world about 20 
billion a year

they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym 
and to due process 
in this country we want to do things fairly and properly 
ochoa said but lauri fillppu of the ins said that the cubans only 
claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in cuba he said the 
11th us circuit court in atlanta already had rejected that 
argument 
fillppu questioned what he called a lastminute tactic by the 
cubans claiming there was no new evidence

carlos salinas de gortari has proved himself 
tough and flexible necessary qualities for dealing with the 
economic crisis and growing political opposition he will face after 
becoming president on thursday 
he is an economist with no experience in elective office and at 
40 will be mexicos youngest president in half a century that may 
be fitting since more than half the nations 84 million people are 
under 16 
salinas also has a disadvantage none of his predecessors has 
experienced serious division within the institutional revolutionary 
party which is known by its spanish initials pri and has governed 
mexico since 1929 
in addition to being the youngest president in decades salinas 
also is one of the best educated he has two masters degrees and a 
doctorate in public administration all from harvard and speaks 
fluent english and french 
the new president is short trim and bald dresses smartly and 
has a full black mustache that enhances an expression of 
halfpuzzled wistfulness that often appears on his face 
friends who know him well including political writer adrian 
lajous say the genial shy exterior hides a man of considerable 
ability and political savvy as evidence they offer the fact that 
he won the presidential nomination from a halfdozen older pri 
rivals 
as budget secretary under miguel de la madrid the outgoing 
president salinas revealed himself as a deft political infighter 
excellent organizer and stickler for efficiency 
he is very fast mentally lajous wrote recently he plucks 
ideas out of thin air his thinking is very sophisticated and 
its a pleasure to watch him sparring 
salinas is known as a demanding boss who expects things to run on 
time what mexicans call american time rather than the less 
precise mexican time 
so greatly does the new president admire japanese discipline that 
he sends his children to a school run by japanese 
he was born april 3 1948 in mexico city but his family is from 
nuevo leon a northern industrial state he married cecilia occelli 
gonzalez in 1972 seven years after they met at a dance and they 
have three children cecilia 14 emiliano 12 and juan cristobal 9 
a keen sportsman salinas was a member of the mexican riding 
association and the national equestrian team winning a silver medal 
at the 1971 pan american games he keeps fit by running and playing 
tennis and is an ardent soccer fan 
like his most recent predecessors salinas rose through the ranks 
of the bureaucracy as a loyal pri member he comes from an old 
family of seasoned pri politicians that settled in the small town of 
agualeguas in nuevo leon in the 18th century and joined the party 
at age 18 
raul salinas his father has served in the senate and as 
commerce secretary his mother margarita de gortari carvajal is an 
economist and was active in party politics for many years 
mexicos president is limited to a single sixyear term and 
salinas faces problems that would have given some of his 
predecessors nightmares 
an economic crisis has impoverished mexico since the bottom fell 
out of world oil prices in 1982 
enormous grassroots support that kept the pri in power for two 
generations has diminished and the spendthrift days of the oil boom 
are gone 
payments on the 102 billion foreign debt have sapped development 
and prompted complaints the countrys efforts to develop industry 
and increase exports serve only to pay wall street bankers 
salinas won narrowly in an election july 6 that was tainted by 
charges of fraud the pri won only 260 seats in the 500seat chamber 
of deputies compared with its customary 70 percent or more 
the wishes of his predecessors often amounted to orders but 
salinas will have to negotiate and compromise with opposition 
leaders who want to use public disaffection with the pri as a 
springboard for the 1994 election 
political analysts say the results last elections results 
indicate people are weary of the pris highhanded ways and want a 
change 
at a recent rally salinas said the oneparty era is over and 
the pri must learn to hustle for votes but there were more charges 
of fraud in recent state elections 
in speeches and interviews salinas has said he will 
modernize mexico paring down the bureaucracy getting rid of 
stateowned companies that lose money fighting corruption 
balancing the budget reducing inflation forcing export industries 
to become more efficient and reforming the pri

crude oil exports are the heart of the economy but nonpetroleum 
exports are growing rapidly sharply lower oil prices caused an 
economic crisis and the standard of living has been cut in half

from development a major problem for a nation that must create 1 
million jobs a year just to keep up with population growth the 
economy is a mixture of private enterprise and the government which 
runs many industries including oil through the monopoly pemex 
mexico is the united states fourth biggest trading partner the

the washington post reported tuesday that a tentative plan for 
the meeting was outlined in paris two weeks ago at a meeting 
attended by assistant treasury secretary david mulford and the 
deputy finance ministers of japan west germany france britain 
canada and italy 
the seven countries dubbed the group of seven meet each year 
for economic summits finance ministers from the nations convene 
three or four times a year to further efforts to promote coordinated 
economic policies 
the source said no dramatic announcements of policy changes would 
be coming from the postinauguration meeting 
the meeting is to give brady a chance to reassure his 
counterparts of policies under a bush administration the source 
said 
the meeting is expected to take place in late february or early 
march 
both bush and brady have been forced since the election to 
reassure jittery financial markets that the new administration has 
no secret plan to drive down the value of the dollar as a way of 
curing the nations huge trade deficits 
bush has insisted that as president he will pursue the same 
policy of coordinated efforts to stabilize the value of the dollar 
that the reagan administration has been pursuing since february 1987

state regulators should move more quickly to 
liquidate insolvent insurers to minimize public harm and avoid 
costly failures similar to those that have hit the savings and loan 
industry an insurance group recommended tuesday 
what we need today is a new determination by the regulators to 
act swiftly said martin j mcfadden jr president of the 
national association of insurance brokers 
in the real world there are significant pressures which 
encourage regulatory delay rather than fast action against insolvent 
underwriters mcfadden told a national press club news conference 
but the consequences for policyholders regulators and insurers 
are far more severe than they would be if regulators acted 
quickly he said 
the study managing insurer insolvency was prepared by 
stewart economics inc for the naib the association represents 58 
international regional and local firms that write more than 75 
percent of the propertycasualty insurance policies for business and 
industry in the united states 
many years ago the mission of regulation was to prevent 
insolvencies it was achieved by government support for cartel 
pricing which covered the costs of the weak the study said 
keeping weak insurers afloat was an accepted cost of the cartel 
system 
but richard stewart one of the studys authors and the former 
superintendent of insurance of new york state contended that 
insolvency is a result of regulation 
stewart said regulators operating on principles from the 
industrys cartel legacy too often focus on heroic rescues of 
insolvent insurers acting as a doctor who needs to keep the 
patient alive instead of allowing failing companies to go under 
this wont get at the guts of the problem taking an 
insurance company out of the marketplace before it does something 
awful to save itself stewart said 
barbara stewart a coauthor of the study said changing 
liability rules catastrophic coverage insurance of the most risky 
situations and events and increased competition also were 
contributing to the worsening insurer insolvency problem 
there have been about 58 propertycasualty insurer insolvencies 
since 1983 according to the naib 
citing a house energy and commerce committee investigation begun 
this fall into the failure of mission insurance co in california 
which is estimated to cost 15 billion mcfadden warned that 
investigations of other failed insurers will continue next year 
there appears to be growing concern among federal policymakers 
that the insurance insolvency problem could parallel the savings and 
loan insolvency problem if regulatory policies remain unchanged 
mcfadden said 
there are disturbing similarities in the insurance industry and 
sampls where fraud and mismanagement resulted in the collapse of the 
system said john chesson counsel to the house subcommittee 
overseeing the insurance insolvency investigations 
chesson said missions insolvency and two others the committee is 
investigating integrity insurance co in new jersey and the los 
angelesbased transit insurance co represent the three largest 
failures ever in the history of insurance

the hardfought contest for senate majority 
leader marked by months of cajoling concluded tuesday in an aura 
of eloquence and cordiality 
maybe it was the hallowed walls of the old senate chamber used 
officially from 1810 to 1859 and still employed occasionally for 
secret meetings like this 
sens george mitchell of maine and bennett johnston of louisiana 
sat together and chatted as they awaited the opening gavel of the 
third competitor democratic conference secretary daniel inouye of 
hawaii 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas the vice presidential nominee won a 
standing ovation from his democratic colleagues and praise from 
nearly every speaker 
and when the first ballot for majority leader put mitchell one 
short of the 28 he needed to win johnston and inouye rose to their 
feet as one to call for a mitchell victory by acclamation 
it was extraordinarily cordial said sen jay rockefeller 
dwva there was not one instance of rancor or disconsonance 
there was no tension at all said sen christopher dodd 
dconn 
there were some extraordinarily good talks said sen wyche 
fowler dga 
seven people spoke on behalf of the three majority leader 
contenders two for mitchell two for inouye and three for 
johnston i of course was the shortest quipped fowler a 
mitchell partisan 
outside the chamber a handful of security officers were charged 
with keeping order among crowds of reporters photographers and 
lobbyists stationed at the imposing mahogany ohio clock presented 
by the state when it became a state 
the eagletopped clock ticked on for more than two hours and a 
grinning mitchell finally emerged flanked by his vanquished rivals 
and the rest of the democratic leadership 
later surrounded by reporters in his office mitchell took a 
series of congratulatory phone calls from president reagan 
presidentelect george bush and vice presidentelect dan quayle 
in a jovial conversation with bush mitchell told him it is a 
welcome sign of your good judgment that you have chosen to live in 
maine even though you didnt have the good fortune to be born 
there 
on a more serious note mitchell told bush i want very much to 
work with you weve got serious problems and challenges and we want 
to deal with them in cooperation with you 
sen bob dole rkansas reelected senate minority leader on 
tuesday said he would be able to work well with mitchell the 
sometimes caustic kansan said a more confrontational approach 
would be unaccustomed to a senator like myself

the judge in the irancontra case on tuesday 
upheld two of the central charges against oliver l north but 
dismissed the third as a purely cumulative count that would only 
confuse jurors 
us district judge gerhard a gesell refused to dismiss the two 
charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of 
government property against the former national security council 
aide that arose from the diversion of usiran armssale proceeds 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
the indictment clearly alleges a conspiracy which involved 
concealing the very existence of the profits of the enterprise from 
the start and hiding from congress information relating to the 
conspirators assistance for the contras gesell said 
its purpose depended on deceit from the start and acts of 
concealment were actually part of the commission of the substantive 
crime the judge said of norths contention the conspiracy count 
was invalid because it alleged more than one criminal conspiracy 
but gesell dismissed a wire fraud charge saying it is in many 
ways a cumulative count that would only create substantial 
confusion in the minds of the jurors 
all three charges also were filed against norths codefendants 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
gesells dismissal of the wire fraud count suggests that charge 
may also be dropped against the other defendants who are scheduled 
to be tried separately 
the judge refused to dismiss six charges that north lied to 
congressional committees that investigated whether he and other 
members of the national security council staff were covertly 
providing military aid to the contras in violation of the law 
so far gesell has ruled on 34 of norths 37 pretrial motions 
he has dismissed only two of the 16 original counts against north 
including a charge that the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
obstructed an fbi probe of the installation of a security fence 
around his great falls va home 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh consented to dismissal of 
that charge 
gesell has yet to rule on three pending defense motions to 
dismiss on other legal ground two charges that north lied to 
congress 
the judge rejected as misplaced norths argument that the 
boland amendments passed by congress banning direct us military 
aid to the contras were unconstitutional and did not apply to the 
national security council 
although the white house expressed doubt about whether the 
amendments prohibited the nsc from aiding the contras gesell noted 
that president reagan signed the provisions into law and agreed to 
comply with them 
norths understanding as to the constitutionality of boland in 
no way affords an excuse for his alleged misconduct or entitled him 
to obstruct the way the government was in fact functioning 
gesell said 
in a related ruling on charges that north falsely assured 
congressional committees he was complying with the boland amendment 
gesell noted that only the president not north or other white house 
staffers could assert executive privilege and refuse to answer 
congress questions about foreign affairs 
deliberate falsifications are another matter and north did not 
himself have executive privilege gesell said 
north did not simply refuse to answer he affirmatively 
deceived congress and there is not the slightest suggestion in 
norths papers that the president instructed north to give false 
information he said 
as he did several weeks ago the judge chided north for offering 
a disdainful view of government by arguing he had a right to lie 
to congress 
the thought that any one of the hundreds or thousands of 
persons working for the president can affirmatively and 
intentionally mislead congress when it weeks information is 
unacceptable on its face gesell said 
north seems to state that executive branch officials and their 
staffs habitually and properly lie to congress the judge said 
he refused to delete from the indictment allegations that north 
violated the boland amendment and two executive orders that 
prohibited government agencies except the cia from engaging in 
covert operations without a presidential finding 
in doing so gesell rejected norths contention that the major 
conspiracy count could not be tried in court because it involved 
foreign policy questions that a court could not consider 
the presidents conduct in implementing his foreign policy or 
intelligence functions is not being brought under scrutiny gesell 
said rather it is what he did and authorized or didnt authorize 
that controls the outcome of the case 
the boland amendment is named for its author rep edward boland 
dmass 
in a separate ruling tuesday the judge refused to exclude walsh 
and his associates from closed hearings set to begin wednesday on 
norths objections to editing 350 classified documents the 
prosecution wants to use as evidence 
he said that excluding prosecutors would alter the purpose of 
the hearing and result in further and wholly unnecessary delay of 
the trial which he previously indicated may start in late january 
norths lawyers had not given a reason for seeking to bar walsh 
and his associates from the hearing but they would likely have 
argued that walsh would get an unfair look at defense strategy by 
attending the proceedings 
gesell last week ordered the closed proceedings to consider 
norths objections to deleting references to countries foreign 
officials and us intelligence operatives from classified documents 
walsh wants to use as evidence 
the judge directed north to explain during the hearings why the 
material he doesnt want deleted from the documents would help him 
defend charges of diverting more than 12 million in usiran 
armssale proceeds to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
north has objected to virtually every deletion proposed by walsh 
from the 350 documents which cover 1000 to 2000 pages walsh has 
received government permission to use the documents as exhibits in a 
public trial as long as the sensitive information is deleted 
the prosecution contends that norths objections and his proposal 
to disclose 40000 additional pages of secret government documents 
is merely an attempt to provoke dismissal of the case

the food and drug administration on tuesday 
approved three tests for a bloodborne virus linked to a rare form 
of leukemia and recommended that blood banks begin screening for it 
the development has been expected for some time and blood banks 
have started preliminary planning to test for htlvi short for 
human tlymphotropic virus type i 
the disease called adult tcell lymphoma may appear in a small 
number of people 20 years to 40 years after they become infected 
with the virus the fda said 
a red cross study has suggested that about two of every 10000 
blood donors carry the virus however scientists believe only about 
1 percent of those infected develop the disease 
by contrast hiv the virus that causes aids acts much more 
quickly sometimes leading to fullstage disease in two or three 
years moreover researchers increasingly are concerned that a very 
high percentage of those infected with the virus perhaps nearly 
all eventually will devlop aids 
all donated blood is already tested for aids and several other 
diseases including two types of hepatitis 
in addition to the rare leukemia htlvi also is associated with 
an even more rare degenerative neurologic disease called tropical 
spastic paraparesis 
based on current data we know that htlvi is rare in the united 
states but to be on the safe side fda has recommended blood 
screening fda commissioner frank e young said if blood tests 
positive it will not be entered into the blood supply 
although the fda technically is only recommending screening for 
htlvi for the time being that recommendation has great weight 
since the agency has the regulatory authority to require such 
testing if blood banks do not act on their own 
the red cross already has announced it will begin screening blood 
donations for htlvi when the test kits became available for 
widespread use 
john horrell a spokesman for the 8000member american 
association of blood banks said tuesday his group is awaiting 
expected guidelines from the fda on recommended testing procedures 
while the association has not taken a formal position it already 
has distributed tentative guidelines to its members and horrell 
said my sense is there will be testing 
he said it was difficult to predict how soon testing will be 
instituted nationwide 
three groups licensed to produce test kits are ei du pont de 
nemours amp co of wilmington del in collaboration with biotech 
research laboratories of rockville md abbott laboratories of 
north chicago ill and cellular products of buffalo ny 
ken koziak a spokesman for du pont said the company will be 
shipping product tomorrow and that the three companies licensed to 
market the test can easily meet demand 
however it is likely to be a month or so before test kids will 
reach every blood bank in the nation 
the new test is expected to be a little more expensive than the 
main aids screening test which averages about 150 per kit

the immediate sequence of events leading to the us refusal of a 
visa to plo chief yasser arafat began nov 15 in algiers when the 
palestinians declared an independent state 
they also issued a political statement widely interpreted as an 
implicit recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism which 
would represent a significant move toward moderation by the 
palestine liberation organization 
although the palestine national council did not specifically 
recognize israels right to exist it accepted three un 
resolutions that do so 
it did not say directly that terrorism would be abandoned but 
committed the plo to the cairo declaration of 1985 which limits 
attacks to military targets in israel and the occupied 
territories military targets are not defined further 
israel described it all as double talk that contained neither 
recognition nor a renunciation of terrorism 
a nearly yearold rebellion against israeli occupation in the 
west bank and gaza strip which has cost the lives of more than than 
300 palestinians provided the impetus for declaring an independent 
state 
after the independence declaration and political statement were 
issued by the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature arafat said the next move toward middle east peace was 
up to the united states 
washington has made recognition of israel and renunciation of 
terrorism conditions for dealing tth the plo 
the reagan administration said the palestinian statement 
contained positive elements but rejected the declaration of 
independence it said the future of the west bank and gaza strip 
must be determined by negotiations with israel which captured them 
from jordan and egypt in 1967 
major sources of confusion about what the palestinians said in 
the political declaration are its vague construction and the fact 
that it was issued only in arabic 
it says a comprehensive political settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict must be reached in a framework that includes 
un resolultions the last of which were un security council 
resolutions 605 607 an 608 which denounce israeli deportation of 
palestinians from the occupied territories 
as a category un resolutions include the general assemblys 
equating of zionism with racism 
the palestine national council also called for an international 
peace conference on the basis of un security council resolutions 
242 and 338 thus implicitly recognizing israel 
resolution 242 passed in 1967 calls for israel to withdraw from 
occupied territories in return for from territories occupied in the 
recent conflict in return for the right to live in peace within 
secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of 
force resolution 338 provides for implementation of 242 
in its declaration of independence the council cited general 
assembly resolution 181 of 1947 which provides for separate arab 
and jewish states in palestine 
many arab and islamic nations recognized the new palestinian 
state in the first days after it was declared and third world 
nations began to join the list 
western european governments generally approved what they 
described as the more moderate palestinian position but did not 
grant diplomatic recognition 
protests and strikes in increased among the 15 million 
palestinians in the occupied territories the israeli army imposed 
curfews and other restrictions in an attempt curb celebrations of 
the independence declaration 
on nov 16 the state department said the algiers political 
declaration fell short of us conditions for dealing with the plo 
two days later the soviet union recognized the proclamation of 
an independent palestinian state in a careful announcement that said 
full diplomatic ties were not included when asked whether that 
amounted to recognition the deputy foreign minister replied in 
essence 
the statement appeared to be an attempt to express continued 
support for the plo without alienating israel with which moscow has 
become more cordial recently 
egypt the only arab nation to sign a peace treaty with israel 
recognized the new state on nov 20 china also extended recognition 
on that day 
arafat said on nov 22 the united states had agreed to grant him 
a visa to address the un general assembly in new york during a 
debate on palestinian issues scheduled to begin dec 1 the united 
states said no application had been received 
an englishlanguage daily published in lebanon the middle east 
reporter said thursday that arafat had declared a moratorium on 
attacks on israel from lebanon as part of the effort to promote the 
declaration of a palestinian state 
on friday in tunis tunisia where the plo has its headquarters 
it applied for a visa at the us consulate 
secretary of state george p shultz issued a twopage statement 
the next day rejecting the visa request 
he said the united states has convincing evidence that plo 
elements have engaged in terrorism against americans and others 
arafat as plo chairman knows of condones and lends support to 
such acts and is an accessory to such terrorism the secretary 
said 
israel applauded the decision but was the only government in the 
world that did allies and friends of the united states urged a 
change of heart 
critics even included the british government of prime minister 
margaret thatcher the reagan administrations staunchest ally a 
foreign office spokesman said britain would have liked to hear 
arafat confirm in new york that the plo recognizes israel and 
has renounced terrorism 
arab nations said monday the general assembly debate would be 
moved to geneva unless the united states granted the visa within 48 
hours the united states said its decision was firm and final 
and consented to moving the meeting 
on tuesday the assembly postponed the debate a senior arab 
diplomat said privately it probably would begin dec 13 or 14 in 
geneva 
carlaugust fleischhauer senior un legal counsel said the 
united states was violating the 1947 usun headquarters 
agreement which requires the host country to provide visas for 
people invited by the united nations 
the agreement says federal state or local authorities of the 
united states shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from 
the headquarters district of representatives of members or officials 
of the united nations or of specialized agencies or 
representatives of nongovernmental organizations recognized by the 
united nations for the for the purpose of consultation 
in refusing the visa the state department relied on a paragraph 
in a us law passed on ratification which is not part of the 
agreement 
it says nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any 
way diminishing abridging or weakening the right of the united 
states to safeguard its own security and completely to control the 
entrance of aliens into any territory of the united states other 
than the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity and 
such areas as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit 
between the same and foreign countries

former defense secretary robert s mcnamara 
called tuesday for cancellation of a major us bomber project and 
two aircraft carrier groups to trim spending by an already 
bankrupt pentagon 
he said the budget will have to be cut 150 billion to 200 
billion dollars over five years and the department itself 
restructured 
mcnamara who was defense secretary from 1961 until 1968 said he 
sympathized with presidentelect george bushs unnamed choice to run 
the pentagon 
there is just no question about it he told the arms control 
association at the private groups annual luncheon meeting the 
defense department is bankrupt they have on contract and plan for 
contract more weapons than any reasonable level of a budget will 
support for the next five years 
mcnamara said cutting the budget and restructuring the pentagon 
is going to be one hell of a job particularly if you do it 
without reducing security 
in fact he said its damn near impossible and perhaps 
politically impossible you are going to have to cut two carrier 
groups either the b1 or b2 you are going to have to do all kinds 
of things that are going to be politically unpopular 
in his speech mcnamara urged completion of a strategic arms 
reduction treaty with the soviet union designed to slash us and 
soviet arsenals of longrange nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent 
the treaty can be completed in a year or less he said 
but mcnamara said arguments raised against the treaty could 
cause the process to unravel he cited the claim the cutbacks would 
make remaining us landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles 
more vulnerable to soviet attack and that the numerical advantage in 
soviet ground forces would pose a greater danger to western europe 
if the attacks continue they can prove to be decisive and we 
will lose the marvelous opportunity to reduce weapons and increase 
stability mcnamara said

the publisher of the newly banned harpers magazine 
joined about 200 prominent britons on tuesday to accuse prime 
minister margaret thatcher of violating civil liberties 
john macarthur president and publisher of the american magazine 
distributed copies of the banned december issue at the meeting 
which was convened to unveil a charter calling for an usstyle 
constitution and bill of rights 
the harpers issue contains excerpts from the memoirs of anthony 
cavendish a former officer of the mi6 intelligence service which 
british newspapers are barred by a court order from publishing 
the government says distribution of the magazine which sells 200 
copies monthly in britain would violate the injunction it says it 
is trying to uphold the principle that an intelligence operative 
bound to secrecy for life cannot publish memoirs 
we object to censorship in britain said macarthur 
he added that harpers published the cavendish memoirs as a 
cautionary tale to alert americans to secrecy moves by the 
reagan administration believe me there is no cause for smugness 
in america he told reporters 
the charter accused mrs thatcher of eroding civil liberties 
during her nearly 10 years in power a process is underway which 
endangers many of the freedoms we have had and is now gathering 
momentum it said 
it indirectly referred to her antiunion legislation limitations 
on suspects right to silence and a ban on broadcast interviews 
with groups supporting terrorism the latter was directed at sinn 
fein the legal wing of the outlawed irish republican army 
signers included novelists margaret drabble john fowles and 
salman rushdie pop musicians peter gabriel and pete townshend 
playwrights harold pinter and michael frayn actors julie christie 
john cleese glenda jackson and dame peggy ashcroft and nobel 
prizewinning scientists sir james black and professor maurice 
wilkins 
but while blaming mrs thatchers government for failing to 
defend civil liberties the charter representatives said the problem 
was rooted in the british political system 
its not an attack on this particular government although this 
government with its overriding parliamentary majority has shown how 
any government without checks and balances without any chance of 
going to the courts or people may destroy liberties said 
geoffrey robertson a leading civil rights lawyer and key figure in 
the campaign 
our unwritten constitution is merely conventions winks and 
nods elbowing which if the government unilaterally decides can 
be snuffed out like that said robertson 
he said he was also concerned that because former british 
colonies still look to britain for legal precedence were seeing 
british law becoming supportive of repressive governments 
the charter calls for a written constitution which enshrines 
civil liberties in a bill of rights establishes freedom of 
information and open government makes an electoral system of 
proportional representation turns the house of lords into an 
elected body provides legal remedies for abuses of power and 
guarantees equal distribution of power between local and national 
bodies

soviet space scientists declared a brilliant 
success the unmanned maiden voyage of the space shuttle buran and 
are planning a much longer second mission tass said tuesday 
the previous program was brilliantly performed when the craft 
came to a halt on the runway its time deviation from the program 
reached only one second while the deviation of the burans axis 
from that of the runway was only 15 meters the official news 
agency reported 
only five of the 39000 heatprotecting tiles broke away during 
the 3hour 20minute flight nov 15 and the spacecraft whose name 
means snowstorm in russian successfully maneuvered in bad weather 
tass said 
it quoted gen german titov as saying we deliberately refused 
to postpone the launch and wait for ideal conditions the value of 
the flight is that its program included the maximum sum of real and 
rather difficult tasks 
tass said the landing took place in relatively high winds and 
thick clouds 
officials have said the shuttles second flight also will be 
unmanned no precise information on its length was available 
cosmonauts on another soviet space mission a joint project 
including french cosmonaut jeanloup chretien began working aboard 
the orbiting space station mir on tuesday a day after docking their 
soyuz tm7 capsule 
chretien will return with vladimir titov and musa manarov who 
have set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year 
when they make the descent dec 21 commander alexander volkov and 
sergei krikalev who went into space with the frenchman will remain 
on the mir until april 
tass said one project designed by french scientists is to make 
a detailed study of the cardiovascular system in space flight 
using ultra sound to evaluate blood flow

the departing head of the federal health 
bureauracy urged his colleagues on tuesday to keep aids from 
becoming a political issue as they attempt to build support for 
fighting the disease in the years ahead 
we have treated aids simply and solely as the public health 
crisis it is health and human services secretary otis r bowen 
told a gathering of top federal officials involved in fighting the 
epidemic 
politically our goal must be to build a consensus to keep the 
focus on public health said bowen 
at the same time our political actions must be consistent both 
with the available knowledge and the proper protection of the public 
health we also must take care not to make the aids crisis a 
referendum on lifestyles or a chance to push liberal or 
conservative agendas 
bowen a physician and former twotime governor of indiana has 
stated that he plans to return to indiana and spend his retirement 
years tending his garden when a new administration takes over jan 
20 
his remarks to more than 200 federal officials convened for a 
twoday conference had the tone of an informal farewell to the 
public health service troops engaged in the struggle against aids 
people with aids should never be treated like political 
footballs or on the other hand political prizes bowen told 
them we must never broker the lives of people with aids for 
political advantage 
also the aids crisis is not to be viewed as a battlefield for 
career advancement or an opportunity to win awards he said 
without naming names bowen said some people have helped to 
foster deep divisions which are counterproductive and destructive to 
the cooperation and partnership necessary to successfully combat 
this epidemic 
he said the bush administration will face many difficult policy 
questions for example whether distributing clean needles to 
addicts might be warranted in restricting the spread of aids even 
though such a program may send the wrong message that drug use can 
be made safe 
another troublesome question is what to do about a pregnant woman 
who shares needles with other addicts infected with aids and thus 
threatens her baby with the infection he said 
what action should the state legitimately take to protect the 
baby bowen asked here we have to balance rights and decide how 
far the state can go to protect a baby threatened by the virus 
he said many other public health concerns are equally complex 
but those in leadership positions are going to have to face up to 
these differences of opinion and make the tough choices 
losing sight of the need to keep public health policy separated 
from liberal or conservative political agendas opens the door to 
danger said bowen 
for example he cited the work of scientists at the national 
institutes of health 
the american people have long had a high regard for whats 
being done at nih and rightly so he said but what would 
happen if one political party twisted scientific information to meet 
a social agenda or to advance political fortune then people would 
be justified in questioning the accuracy of that information 
leaving doubt as to the real facts 
he said there is already a temendous amount of denial now 
many people want to believe that they are immune to aids or 
that somehow this cant happen to them he said if scientific 
information were altered to suit our own political purposes we run 
the very real risk of creating even more doubt dissension and 
disbelief the ultimate result could be the continued spread of the 
virus perhaps at an accelerated rate

tuesday proposed tightening the rules that govern stock trading by 
corporate officers and other socalled insiders 
since 1934 federal regulations have required corporate officers 
and directors to disclose publicly whenever they buy or sell stock 
in their own company the commission by a 30 vote invited public 
comment for 90 days on what would be the first major change to the 
rules since they were established to prevent insiders from 
gaining advantage from information not available to all stockholders 
corporate officers are supposed to report to the sec within 10 
days of acquiring insider status they must file subsequent reports 
in the first 10 days of the month after they buy or sell stock 
according to a survey by the sec staff 43 percent of the reports 
have been filed late so far this year an unknown number of insiders 
never filed at all 
under the proposal companies would be required to list violators 
in their annual reports and proxy statements 
insiders also would be required to report trades in 
exchangelisted options as well as stocks 
a new and narrower definition of insider is being proposed to 
include only chief executives and other policymaking officers 
and the commmission is asking for public comment on whether it 
should seek authorization from congress to impose fines against 
violators currently its only option is to seek a court order 
forcing compliance

a toddlers abdomen was virtually replaced 
tuesday in a rare fiveorgan transplant that doctors said was the 
3yearold girls only chance for survival 
rolandrea dodge of fruitland nm received a new liver 
pancreas stomach small intestine and a portion of a large 
intestine the young donor was not identified rolandreas spleen 
also was removed 
the patient is doing fine said dr satoru todo who headed 
the surgical team at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
todo said the 16hour operation which is considered 
experimental went smoothly except for one episode when the chilled 
organs inserted into her body lowered her temperature dramatically 
and her heart stopped beating for about a minute 
he said surgeons restarted her heart with cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation techniques 
todo said rolandreas heart was functioning normally following 
surgery and she was moving her hands and legs her liver also was 
producing bile a positive sign he said 
she was in critical condition in the hospitals intensive care 
unit after the operation which ended at 340 pm tuesday 
the prognosis is very difficult to say but im expecting it to 
go well todo said 
five organs have been transplanted simultaneously only once 
before last november tabatha foster 3 of madisonville ky 
underwent the same operation at the same hospital she died six 
months later of a blood infection 
tabatha survived longer than any of the other three people in the 
united states who had abdominal transplants involving two or more 
organs 
they doctors may have gone ahead with a little more 
confidence knowing how far tabatha succeeded said hospital 
spokeswoman sue cardillo 
rolandrea who is known as rolly was born with an incurable 
disease called intractable secretory diarrhea which prevented her 
intestines from absorbing food and liquids she had to be fed 
intravenously although she was allowed occasional nibbles of candy 
potatoes and other solid food 
aside from brief outings rolly has spent her entire life in 
hospitals 
the girls liver began failing about three months ago as a result 
of her highprotein intravenous feedings and her skin became 
jaundiced 
she received a pancreas and stomach in addition to intestines and 
a liver because it is easier to implant a large portion of the 
abdominal tract all at once 
rolandrea arrived in october to be evaluated for transplant she 
was accompanied by her parents branden and cyndi dodge who also 
have two sons her parents were with her before she went into 
surgery 
doctors in new mexico said she wouldnt survive long without a 
transplant 
doctors began administering an experimental drug nov 9 in hopes 
of allowing her intestines to absorb food and liquids but it was 
unsuccessful ms cardillo said that was really the last 
available treatment option she said 
dodge 27 a coal miner said it was difficult deciding whether 
to allow the transplant but its the only hope that weve got 
left 
we dont have any doubts he said its just the way our 
indian people are thats just the way they taught us try not to 
think negative about things its going to work out

the justice department said tuesday it will 
review a drug enforcement administration practice of sometimes 
arranging for local police to make wellpublicized seizures of drugs 
brought into the united states under the control of dea operatives 
associate attorney general francis keating the no 3 official in 
the justice department plans to meet with dea officials to discuss 
the matter said loye miller a department spokesman 
the meeting stems from a houston chronicle story sunday which 
said the dea had arranged at least two drug seizures by state or 
local authorities in the houston area to generate false news reports 
which would protect the identity of dea undercover operatives 
the undercover operatives sometimes pose as middlemen and ship 
loads of narcotics into the united states for south american 
druglords 
the dea on occasion then arranges for local law enforcement 
agents to seize the incoming drug shipments in an attempt to 
insulate the operatives from disclosure said dea sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
in addition to keep the drugs off the street the practice also 
is designed to allow the dea to continue criminal investigations 
aimed at toplevel narcotics figures the sources said 
john seigenthaler president of the american society of newspaper 
editors said it is misleading to the press and public for the dea 
to initiate what becomes a highly publicized drug seizure by state 
and local police when the shipment has in fact been controlled by 
the dea 
i understand they have to find some way to protect the lives of 
the people and the security of the operation but when they engage 
in subterfuge or creating situations that really dont exist they 
have to expect that sooner or later people are going to find out 
said seigenthaler they have to find some other way to protect 
people and the security of the operation 
in a statement the dea said it is not the agencys policy to 
lie or mislead the media nor is it our policy to misrepresent 
information to the media no techniques have ever been used or will 
ever be used that are designed to out and out mislead or lie to the 
media or public 
but to preserve the integrity of ongoing probes which often 
involve wiretaps undercover operations and money laundering and to 
assure that the highest level traffickers are eventually prosecuted 
we cannot release all of the details of these events as they 
occur the dea statement added 
the techniques used to prevent drugs from reaching market become 
public knowledge at the time of prosecution the statement said 
the houston chronicle cited an instance in 1984 in which dea 
agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the country then 
abandoned their van at a prearranged roadblock set up by the texas 
department of public safety dps alerted news reporters that 
troopers had found a cache of drugs which they described at the time 
as one of texas largest seizures 
a dea case agent describing the arrangement in testimony during 
a bond hearing for a man arrested in the operation testified that 
we had a prearranged setup arranged with the texas department of 
public safety where they would stage a traffic stop and seize the 
contraband 
in a second instance on sept 29 of this year said the 
chronicle a load of cocaine was planted in an abandoned car and 
left to be discovered by deputies with the harris county texas 
sheriffs department who notified reporters 
dea spokesman maurice hill declined to discuss the sept 29 
seizure but denied that the cocaine had been planted in the car 
hill also denied that the agency had been in control of the sept 29 
shipment

lyndon h larouches political movement 
was buying expensive virginia properties at a time when millions of 
dollars in loans to his organizations were not being repaid the 
political mavericks conspiracy trial was told tuesday 
richard welsh a larouche aide said a larouche real estate 
company spent about 4 million on land for a security training 
facility for a summer camp for children of larouche employees and a 
farm where larouche and his wife helga live when in the united 
states 
during the same period around may 1986 larouche wrote elizabeth 
sexton who was seeking repayment of nearly 113000 in loans that 
she could not be repaid because no discretionary funds were 
available 
larouche and six associates are on trial in us district court 
on charges that they conspired to defraud investors by not repaying 
more than 30 million in loans that they made to larouche 
organizations 
larouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service by failing to declare as income personal and 
household services provided him by his organizations 
welsh who received immunity from prosecution testified that 5 
million of the loan amount eventually was repaid 
welsh who was assistant treasurer of larouches 1984 
presidential campaign and still works for him said the campaign 
devised a plan to pay back 4 million it borrowed for that campaign 
but that the repayment system broke down he said the campaign still 
owes between 15 million and 2 million 
welsh said that when lenders complained about nonrepayment the 
local campaign organizer who originally secured the money was to 
attempt to have the loan forgiven or a new schedule of payments 
worked out 
but welsh said the system did not work well because some 
organizers never got back to the lender and others made an 
insufficient effort in some cases he said lenders were told 
something would be done when no action was planned 
assistant us attorney kent robinson asked welsh if lenders were 
told in effect the check is in the mail when no check had been 
issued 
yes welsh replied 
under crossexamination from larouche attorney odin anderson 
welsh sought to distance larouche from daytoday operations of his 
organizations 
he is the founder and leading thinker the primary person who 
defines broad policies general objectives and political goals 
welsh said i dont recall him involved in daytoday financial 
operations 
welsh also told the jury that in september 1986 he launched 
project apollo to gain control of the loan situation he 
said the project involved a combination of repayments requests for 
forgiveness of loans and attempts to have promised interest rates 
lowered or payments stretched out 
he said the operation came to a sudden halt when federal and 
state law enforcement authorities raided larouches leesburg va 
headquarters oct 6 1986 and seized just about every scrap of 
paper having to do with any financial record 
despite the raid welsh testified virtually all the 3500 people 
with loans outstanding had been contacted and total debt by early 
1987 was reduced by 15 million 
in addition welsh said that in april 1987 the three main 
larouche organizations that owed lenders money were placed in 
involuntary bankruptcy in a government action that froze the 
groups financial transactions 
the final disruption to the repayment campaign welsh said came 
when several banks froze larouche organization accounts after it 
became public knowledge that a federal grand jury in boston was 
investigating the movements financial dealings 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
the mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of 
credit sent through the mails by the larouche organization 
conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years 
in prison and fines of 325 million for larouche 
the six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail 
fraud and conspiracy charges which cover the years 1983 to 1987 
in the tax conspiracy count the federal grand jury charged that 
larouche has not filed a federal income tax return since at least 
1979 
on trial with larouche are his chief fundraiser william wertz 
his legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

president daniel ortega of nicaragua extended 
a truce with guerrillas through the end of december but said 
tuesday his nation will maintain a state of alert until it sees a 
change in us policy 
ortegas leftist sandinista government extends a march 21 
ceasefire unilaterally on a monthly basis the usbacked rebels 
called contras say the truce is indefinite and need not be extended 
each side has accused the other of violations ortega renewed the 
charges tuesday during a news conference at the nicaraguan 
ambassadors residence 
the truce forbids offensive military action ortega denied contra 
claims that soldiers have attacked and characterized recent army 
operations as defensive 
he is in mexico city for the thursday inauguration of 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari and said he had no plans 
to meet secretary of state george p shultz who will represent the 
united states 
ortega said he would wait and see what happens when george bush 
is installed in january as president of the united states but told 
the news conference 
while the us government doesnt show a changed attitude 
toward nicaragua we cant change our own readiness up to and 
including the possibility of invasion by american troops we are in 
constant and permanent alert 
other nicraguan officials have said they expect a more 
pragmatic attitude toward nicaragua by a bush administration 
ortega said he hopes the new administration will accept as a 
reality that we survived all the efforts of a superpower to destroy 
the nicaraguan revolution 
he referred to president reagans support for the contras since 
they began fighting eight years ago congress has refused to provide 
money for weapons since march 
the nicaraguan president said the salinas inauguration gives 
central american presidents a good chance to discuss problems on an 
informal basis and said they should arrange a future meeting 
without preconditions 
presidents jose napoleon duarte of el salvador jose azcona hoyo 
of honduras and vinicio cerezo of guatemala also are to attend the 
inauguration but not oscar arias of costa rica arias won the 1987 
nobel peace prize for a central american peace plan that was agreed 
upon aug 7 1987 but has stalled 
when asked if he would be willing to drop a complaint against 
honduras at the world court in the hague netherlands ortega said 
we should meet without any preconditions to discuss our problems 
and not only if all our problems are solved 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a ceasefire agreement 
march 23 under which the rebels were to stop fighting in exchange 
for democratic reforms in nicaragua both sides suspended offensive 
military operations and a formal truce took effect april 1 
talks on details of the truce agreement broke off and no 
negotiations have been held since september most contra fighters 
have left nicaragua for camps in honduras 
nicaragua accuses honduras of harboring the rebels and permitting 
them to launch operations from honduran territory that is the basis 
of the world court action

dozens of former senior army officials 
joined about 10000 demonstrators in front of tel aviv city hall on 
tuesday to protest draft deferments given to orthodox yeshiva 
students 
the fighters of israel from all generations are against draft 
evasion proclaimed a sign on the speakers platform set up in 
kings of israel square 
living on somebody elses blood read another sign held aloft 
by protesters 
speakers told the bannerwaving rally that about 19000 
ultraorthodox youths were granted deferments in 1988 letting them 
postpone army service while they study in yeshivas or religious 
seminaries 
shlomo lahat mayor of tel aviv and a reserve army general told 
the mostly liberal audience it was unfair for ultraorthodox parties 
to demand cabinet seats if they supported avoiding national service 
morally the state of israel cannot accept such a thing it 
cant be that they will have only rights and not duty as well 
said lahat a liberal member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc 
former chief of staff rafael eitan leader of a farright party 
that advocates annexation of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
said ways could be found for yeshiva students to learn the torah and 
serve their country at the same time 
the public has to demand of its representatives that existing 
standards be changed said eitan 
asked about military exemptions at a meeting of israeli 
journalists tuesday prime minister shamir said the agreement with 
the orthodox went back three decades and no plans were under way to 
change this informal undertanding 
he denied rumors that the issue was discussed in likuds ongoing 
talks with four small religious parties who demanded religious 
legislatio in exchange for supporting a likudled government 
leaders of ultraorthodox religious parties denied that yeshiva 
students enter seminaries to avoid military service they say most 
eventually wind up in the army 
however they say study of the torah and jewish religious 
tradition cannot be limited to specific periods of time 
thus students often miss the compulsory threeyear national 
service because they exceed the maximum draft age of 26 
poet chaim hefer who wrote wellknown songs commemorating 
israels 1948 war of independence disputed contentions that most 
yeshiva students did serve in the army 
he said that in 1986 only 244 of 17017 eventually did their 
national service he gave no figures on how many eventually served 
in the reserve army all males up to age 49 must serve up to 62 days 
a year in the reserves 
hefer said 5877 students postponed military service in 1970 but 
deferments swelled to 12596 during the lebanon war and now exceeded 
19000 
reserve col dalia raz former head of the womens corps said 
religious women should no longer be exempt from military service 
religious women are usually required to do a oneyear community 
service instead of the twoyear womens army service but this is 
not enforced 
a veteran who lost both legs an arm and an eye in the 198285 
lebanon war said to loud applause i dont understand why i had 
to fight and lose my legs and lose my friends while someone sits 
in school and prays 
the veteran identified as maoziya said he would soon be doing a 
voluntary onemonth tour of reserve duty and if i can go to the 
reserves so can they

prime minister yitzhak shamirs conservative 
likud bloc and the rival labor party moved closer to coalition on 
tuesday and orthodox religious parties threatened to withdraw 
support for likud 
shamir who offered labor two of the four most important cabinet 
ministries if it joins the government as a junior partner said he 
would finish forming a government in a few days 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor urged his centerleft 
party to join a government led by shamir in order to block orthodox 
demands for religious legislation opposed by jews abroad 
religious parties want a new who is a jew law that would 
accept only conversions to judaism performed by orthodox rabbis the 
demand has angered american jews most of whom belong to the reform 
or conservative movements 
labor and likud have been equal partners in a national unity 
coalition since the inconclusive election of july 1984 in the nov 
1 election likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats and labor 39 
rightwing religious parties won 18 seats 
the ultraorthodox party shas which made participation in a 
likud government contingent on religious legislation and control of 
two ministries threatened to withdraw its support party spokesman 
tzvi yakobson said tuesday 
shamir has to promise that we will receive two ministries even 
in a broadbased government he said otherwise well see 
ourselves free from the agreement with likud 
israel radio said the threat came after a short and stormy 
meeting between shamir and rabbi yitzhak peretz the shas leader in 
which shamir refused the demands 
the council of torah sages spiritual leaders of agudat israel 
another orthodox party met to discuss the coalition developments 
and media reports said one possibility raised was a switch of 
support to labor 
were not chained in an agreement with likud rabbi abraham 
verdiger the party leader said on israel army radio 
shamir could not form a rightwing coalition without shas and 
agudat israel which together have ll seats in the knesset israels 
parliament 
some in likud urged shamir to accept the orthodox demand cabinet 
minister ariel sharon a rival of shamirs who fears being bypassed 
if a deal is struck with labor called the law a national necessity 
sharon wants to be defense minister which is one of the senior 
posts offered to labor and probably would be kept by rabin 
the other presumably would be the foreign ministry held by shimon 
peres the labor party leader peres was prime minister and shamir 
foreign minister in the first two years of the national unity 
coalition

a judge ruled tuesday that two children 
should be placed in a foster home rather than with their mother who 
went to jail last year claiming she was hiding them from an abusive 
father 
rockingham county superior court judge kenneth mchugh ruled that 
the father mark russell murabito should have joint custody of the 
children with his exwife jesse murabito previously mrs murabito 
had custody and her exhusband had visitation rights 
both mother and children have been missing since murabito 34 of 
derry was acquitted earlier this month of a charge of sexual 
assault of his daughter now 5 years old after the verdict he 
said he would seek custody of the girl and her 4yearold brother 
he also obtained a court order barring mrs murabito from taking 
the children out of the state or letting them live with anyone else 
mrs murabito 40 of belmont went to jail for a week in 
february 1987 rather than tell a judge where she hid the children 
from their father 
but she apparently never was served the court order later 
obtained by the father and she and the children have been missing 
since the verdict through several media interviews she has said 
she is living with a family out of the state in a network that 
protects alleged victims of sexual abuse 
mchugh said tuesday that mrs murabito even though she was not 
served with the papers was in enough contact through the media to 
know she should not have left new hampshire also he said in this 
type of case such an order does not have to be handdelivered but 
can be mailed which is what the court did 
mchugh said mrs murabito is violating a visitation agreement she 
had with her husband he also said though he gave them joint 
custody it would be in the childrens best interest to stay in a 
foster home 
murabito initially had asked for joint custody with the state 
and wanted the children to be placed in a foster home 
through his lawyer murabito said his children have been 
brainwashed by their mother and that it would be some time before 
they learned to trust him again he eventually wants full custody 
he said 
state guardian neil reardon said mrs murabito exercised poor 
judgment by going into hiding because it is harmful to the 
childrens mental health

archaeologists have uncovered a bronze age 
port on the israeli coast with a warehouse stocked with raisins 
peas and olives dating to about 1200 years before christ the 
director of the excavation said 
professor michal artzy of the university of haifa said in an 
interview that the site uncovered at tel nami 12 miles south of the 
modern port city of haifa could be the oldest manmade port ever 
found 
in that period seafarers tended to hug the coast and they 
used to come into port once every two days for food so you needed 
ports along the shore at set stretches she said there is 
little reason for this site to exist except as a port 
researchers found evidence a channel was cut between the 
mediterranean and a river to form the port ms artzy said she said 
the port appeared to date to at least 2000 bc but further 
research was needed to confirm the date 
objects uncovered in excavations begun last year include gold and 
silver jewelry bronze sculptures and pottery from ancient 
civilizations ms artzy said 
ms artzy who also serves on the staff of the university of 
massachusetts at amherst was assisted on the dig last summmer by 
students from amherst and from texas a and m at college station and 
cornell university in ithaca ny 
foodstuffs found in a warehouse were well preserved because a 
fire in about 1200 bc apparently caused a roof to collapse 
blocking oxygen from reaching the food and damaging it she said 
we have whole examples of seeds and raisins like your mother 
used to give you when you were a kid ms artzy said 
the site apparently was abandoned after the fire and never 
resettled 
she said artifacts found at the site indicated local residents 
were very wealthy and that the port was an international trading 
center 
these were sea people with a lot of wealth ms artzy said 
she added whether it was from piracy or this is simply a rich 
port we dont know 
the pottery came egypt cyprus the ancient greek states of troy 
and mycenae and elsewhere she said 
she displayed other items that were found including gold rings 
and earrings a childs gold necklace silver rings and a 
handcrafted egyptian ring 
so many bronze items were found that archaeologists believe a 
bronze workshop may have existed at the site 
items include one bronze stand for incense burning that is 
decorated with pomegranates and another with the figure of a woman 
these are especially valuable because they are unusually well 
preserved she said there was obviously a cult aspect to this 
the womans body and the pomegranate perhaps a fertility cult

democrat gary harts 1984 presidential 
campaign still trying to clear up its debtridden books must pay a 
12000 penalty for violations cited in an agreement with the 
federal election commission 
the campaign agreed to pay the civil penalty for violations that 
included harts use of his personal credit card for campaign 
expenses beyond the 50000 the law says a candidate may contribute 
to his campaign 
in a separate penalty the fec cited a violation by the media 
firm sempermoser associates which agreed to pay 5000 for 
improperly advancing the hart campaign more than 100000 worth of 
credit 
although the firm expected to be paid back the money and 
ironically ended up going to federal court to get 106000 in back 
payment the credit arrangement with the campaign was illegal 
because it was not in the ordinary course of business according 
to the settlement statement recently made public by the fec 
election law requires that companies conduct relations with 
political campaigns in the same manner that they would with any 
other entity to ensure that no special treatment is accorded the 
campaigns 
by agreeing to provide time buys and media services for harts tv 
commercials on credit which was not a customary practice 
sempermoser was making a corporate contribution the fec found 
corporate donations are banned in federal elections 
the debts relate to harts first race for the presidency the 
former senator from colorado also entered the 1988 democratic 
primary race dogged by the debts of his attempt four years earlier 
while the 1988 campaign ended up solvent the 1984 effort still 
owes more than 1 million to creditors according to the latest 
report on file with the fec 
the fec found that hart improperly used his personal credit card 
for more than 20000 worth of expenditures above the 50000 
contribution limit he was allowed while there was an understanding 
that the campaign would pay the bills promptly the payments were 
made an average 266 days late the fec said 
harts campaign claimed he was unaware of the tardiness and that 
all the bills eventually were paid but the fec faulted the campaign 
for failure to pay in a reasonable time 
in addition harts campaign acknowledged receiving contributions 
from 49 individuals whose donations exceeded the 1000 perperson 
limit imposed by election law the excess contributions totaled 
19606 and the improper donations were ultimately refunded

black and jewish veterans of the civil rights 
movement joined hands tuesday and sang we shall overcome as they 
remembered their coalitions martyrs and looked to its future 
former president jimmy carter whose presidential library was 
host to the twoday conference on blackjewish relations called 
cooperation between the two groups in the civil rights movement an 
extraordinary demonstration of common purpose 
i saw even while i was in the white house some beginnings of 
fragmentation in that partnership and i think your effort to bring 
it back together and to derive the great benefits that can flow from 
it is indeed a noble effort carter told conference participants 
tuesday 
a memorial service honored andrew goodman james chaney and 
michael schwerner civil rights workers killed in mississippi in 
1964 as well as others who were slain such as martin luther king 
jr chaney was black while goodman and schwerner were jewish 
during the service goodmans mother carolyn goodman of new 
york read a brief quotation from king and chaneys brother ben 
chaney of new york read from the writings of a jewish victim of the 
holocaust anne frank 
the service was prolonged as conference participants brought up 
many more names of departed heroes including many who were neither 
black nor jewish 
the conference was designed to chronicle blackjewish cooperation 
of the past but several speakers tuesday emphasized the coalitions 
recent strains and its hopes for reconciliation 
conference participant wilbert tatum of new york called the 
difficulty in blackjewish relations something terrible 
i think in retrospect it was based more on not in my back 
yard than any other sentiment tatum said 
he said he hoped the twoday conference which concluded tuesday 
at the carter presidential center would be a catharsis 
among those warmly recalling old friendships tuesday was atlanta 
mayor andrew young 
there was no more important relationship in the civil rights 
movement than the relationship of martin luther king and stanley 
levison young said he called levison an atlanta attorney and 
activist an important voice of reason who emphasized nonviolence 
the conference the blackjewish alliance reunion and 
renewal was sponsored by the carter center the martin luther 
king jr center for nonviolent social change the washingtonbased 
marjorie j kovler institute for blackjewish relations and the 
religious action center of reform judaism

the roar of chain saws and the smell of pine 
from shattered trees permeated the air tuesday as residents began 
putting their lives back together and cleaning up from an estimated 
100 million in tornado damage 
all my damage is minor compared to some of these people said 
jeff johnston as he and his wife helen began cleanup and repairs 
their house had broken windows and a piece of log embedded in the 
wall a tool shed was destroyed 
the johnstons nextdoor neighbors were worse off the side of 
their house was torn off theyll have to move johnston said 
this whole neighborhood is going to change a lot 
four people died 157 were injured and about 850 were left 
homeless as the tornadoes tossed cars houses and trees like 
playthings along a 200mile stretch of eastern north carolina early 
monday 
it was the first time since the state began keeping records in 
1916 that tornadoes caused deaths in november according to the 
national climatic data center in asheville 
damage was estimated at 100 million statewide according to the 
state public safety department raleigh alone suffered 75 million 
in damage the city managers office said 
teams from the small business administration and federal 
emergency management agency fanned out tuesday to calculate damage 
in all nine affected counties and determine what areas would be 
eligible for federal disaster aid 
the dead were 12yearold edwin pete fulghum and 9yearold 
janet barnes both of raleigh and a nash county couple lee roy and 
mary alston who died in each others arms when the storm hit their 
mobile home 
the red cross and other relief agencies said they were swamped 
with offers of help 
it renews your faith in humanity said helen sibley nurse 
coordinator for the local red cross chapter 
more than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by 
the storm she said leaving only 17 people in a wake county shelter 
thats why there are not more people in the shelter she 
said people in the city dont think other people care much about 
them but when something like this happens we come together 
businesses individuals and churches donated food and other 
supplies a table in the school cafeteria was piled with sandwiches 
fruit snacks candy and desserts 
in raleigh police restricted access to damaged areas said 
spokeswoman jade jurek fourteen people have been charged with 
looting since the tornadoes struck according to a wake county 
magistrate six raleigh residents including four juveniles were 
charged monday with looting from a k mart that was flattened by the 
storm 
the state public safety department said tuesday that 520 homes 
were destroyed and more than 1200 were damaged fortyone 
businesses were either destroyed or damaged 
gov jim martin asked the federal officials to declare wake 
county a disaster area and the surveys of other counties will help 
determine whether any other areas might also be eligible for 
disaster aid or reducedcost small business administration loans 
al warlick a spokesman for the north carolina department of 
crime control and public safety said damage in wake county is 
probably extensive enough to warrant assistance from the federal 
emergency management agency a presidential disaster declaration is 
required for fema aid to be released 
we are going to send a delegation to washington with these 
letters requesting disaster aid to make sure that any question can 
be answered face to face if necessary he said

an israeli attorney for convicted nazi war 
criminal john demjanjuk died tuesday after hurling himself from the 
15th floor an office building police said

said it could delay demjanjuks appeal of his conviction and death 
sentence for nazi war crimes scheduled next week 
eitan a 53yearold former judge who joined demjanjuks defense 
team in august died after jumping from the 15th floor of the city 
towers office complex in downtown jerusalem police spokesman rafi 
levy said 
eitan did not leave a note explaining his motives but deputy 
police spokesman alex lapidot said police were certain the death was 
a suicide 
there was no note at all none we are trying to determine what 
was behind it lapidot said but there was no criminal element 
it was suicide 100 percent 
israel radio said police found traces of polish from eitans 
shoes on the sill of the window from which he jumped in the 
15thfloor lobby of the ayalon hotel eitan entered the lobby 
without being noticed by the receptionist the only person there 
the radio said 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic said the defense would 
request a delay in the appeal set to start monday court spokesman 
yossi hassin said the bench probably would grant at least a weeks 
delay 
supreme court president meir shamgar invited the parties in the 
case for a discussion in his chambers wednesday morning shamgar is 
to decide whether the appeal proceedings will start monday or be 
postponed until demjanjuk appoints a new lawyer israel television 
said 
in a telephone interview from cleveland nishnic said eitan was 
to have presented 60 percent of demjanjuks appeal and that other 
lawyers would not be ready to argue the case monday 
were very upset and concerned nishnic told the associated 
press we spoke to eitan yesterday he was extremely optimistic 
and said he hopes to see us in israel 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk 68 was convicted in april of 
crimes against humanity and against the jewish people he was found 
to have been ivan the terrible a brutal guard who operated gas 
chambers that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in 
nazioccupied poland 
demjanjuk who lived in the cleveland suburb of seven hills 
before being extradited to israel in february 1986 claims he is a 
victim of mistaken identity 
court spokesman yassin said he saw eitan on monday and he 
appeared very cheerful 
he was checking all the court arrangements where the accused 
would sit where he would sit its all very strange hassin said 
demjanjuks daughter irene nishnic 27 said the family had left 
a message for demjanjuk at his maximumsecurity prison about eitans 
death 
im sure this is going to be a shock to my dad he really got 
along well with eitan and had a lot of confidence in what he was 
going to do for him mrs nishnic said adding that eitan had met 
with demjanjuk a week ago 
an attorney who previously represented demjanjuk john gill of 
cleveland said he hoped police would investigate the death to see 
if there was any foul play 
im not suggesting there is or would be or was but i do think 
that would have to be explored gill said by telephone from 
cleveland 
a defense witness swedishborn anita pritchard tried to commit 
suicide by slitting her wrists and swallowing tranquilizers on aug 
21 1987 after her testimony was discredited during the trial 
eitan served for 17 years as a jerusalem district court judge 
before retiring in 1983 his joining the defense was widely viewed 
in israel as adding prestige to the team 
he is survived by his wife who lives in jerusalem and two 
children

george mitchell of maine was elected senate 
majority leader on tuesday by democrats seeking a forceful new 
spokesman during yet another republican reign at the white house 
and he quickly promised george bush his initiatives will be met with 
interest and enthusiasm 
mitchell a 55yearold former federal judge easily defeated 
sens bennett johnston of louisiana and daniel inouye of hawaii he 
succeeds robert c byrd of west virginia who stepped aside after 12 
years as the senates democratic leader 
asked if he would cooperate with bush mitchell said he plans to 
meet soon with the presidentelect and we hope to move forward on 
a broad range of issues including the federal deficit health 
care day care and the environment 
mitchell also planned to meet wednesday with sen bob dole of 
kansas reelected by republicans to a third term as their leader 
earlier tuesday 
mitchell received congratulatory calls from bush and vice 
presidentelect dan quayle as well as president reagan 
the democrats await with interest and enthusiasm the proposals 
of the next administration mitchell said 
mitchell who was just elected to his second term in the senate 
has a liberal voting record but promised to work with all the 
democrats in developing a broad agenda 
within minutes of his election mitchell emerged from the party 
caucus in the historic old senate chamber of the capitol to meet 
with reporters quickly turning aside suggestions he would be a 
partisan fighter he said we hope to cooperate with the new 
administration to deal with the serious problems and important 
challenges facing our nation 
mitchell fell only one vote short of winning the democratic 
leadership post on the first ballot picking up 27 votes inouye and 
johnston tied for second at 14 votes each and quickly agreed to 
give mitchell a unanimous victory 
the best man won george mitchell will be a great majority 
leader johnston said 
mitchell a janitors son who worked his way through college was 
looked to by many colleagues as a solid articulate leader and 
speaker who can serve as a spokesman for all democrats 
i think the democrats have realized the need in the presence 
of a republican administration to have a person who not only makes 
the senate function but also be a party spokesman said sen 
joseph biden ddel 
there was a unanimous feeling even among those who supported 
the other two candidates that george mitchell well fits that 
bill biden said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that although mitchell is 
an eastern liberal his impressive margin of victory is a welcome 
signal that the liberal and progressive ideals of the democratic 
party have broad support among senate democrats from all parts of 
the country 
perhaps mitchells greatest claim to public fame was his 
performance last year during the irancontra hearings in a quiet 
but nationally televised confrontation with lt col oliver north 
who had testified with great patriotic fervor mitchell looked at 
the witness and spoke into the microphone 
please remember that others share that devotion and recognize 
that it is possible for an american to disagree with you on aid to 
the contras and still love god and still love this country just as 
much as you do 
the democratic caucus also elected sen alan cranston of 
california to another term as party whip despite a challenge from 
wendell ford of kentucky 
byrd was elected president pro tempore of the senate and also 
will serve as chairman of the appropriations committee when the 
101st congress convenes next january 
david pryor of arkansas defeated patrick leahy of vermont to 
become secretary of the democratic conference alan dixon of 
illinois defeated spark matsunaga of hawaii to become chief deputy 
whip and john breaux of louisiana was named chairman of the 
democratic senatorial campaign committee 
in the republican caucus alan simpson was reelected gop whip 
without opposition john chafee of rhode island defeated frank 
murkowski of alaska as conference chairman bill armstrong was 
elected chairman of the policy committee thad cochran of 
mississippi was elected conference secretary and don nickels of 
oklahoma defeated john mccain of arizona to be chairman of the 
national republican senatorial committee

the general assemblys legal committee 
voted 1212 tuesday night to ask the state department to grant plo 
chairman yasser arafat a us visa only the united states and 
israel were opposed 
it was an indication of how lopsided the vote is likely to be 
wednesday when the 159member general assembly takes up the 
arabsponsored resolution deploring us denial of a visa to arafat 
so he can address the assembly at un headquarters in new york 
in denying the visa on saturday the state department said arafat 
had condoned acts of terrorism committed by the palestine liberation 
organization on tuesday it said its rejection was final 
all un member nations are represented on the legal committee 
but not all were present for the vote tuesday night 
un officials meanwhile began calculating the cost of the 
unprecedented step of moving the general assembly to geneva to hear 
arafat speak on the palestinian problem and middle east issues one 
source suggested it could run around 150000 
arab diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
have enough votes to reconvene the general assembly in geneva they 
said the session probably would be in the week of dec 1216 with 
dec 1314 the likely dates it would be the first time the general 
assembly has shifted its session in protest although special 
sessions have been held in geneva 
most nations were expected to assign their geneva ambassadors to 
the session and nations would bear the cost of their own travel 
diplomats said 
the general assembly on tuesday delayed its annual debate on the 
palestinian problem originally scheduled for thursday friday and 
dec 6 to permit arrangements for arafat to speak elsewhere 
the us rejection of a visa set off an international uproar and 
demands that arafat be allowed to speak 
if us authorities reject the resolution to reconsider as is 
expected the next step will be a second resolution later this week 
seeking to move the assembly to geneva the diplomats said 
backstage deliberations sponsored by the british failed to remove 
harsh language from the first resolution it says america is in 
violation of the host country agreement and deplores the 
failure to grant arafat a visa 
under the 1947 usun headquarters agreement the united 
states pledges not to impede the travel or work of un diplomats or 
guests the plo holds nonvoting observer status at the united 
nations and is an honored invitee 
it is considered the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people and is invited to speak in all such debates 
in washington secretary of state george p shultz said the 
strong opposition to his decision to bar arafat shows that people 
are forgetting what a threat international terrorism is 
to some extent the opposition suggests how important it was to 
decide what was decided and to make it so clear what the basis 
was shultz said the basis was our concern about terrorism 
and i am afraid that its too easy for people to forget what an 
important problem that is and what a threat it is to civilized 
society 
in jerusalem israeli premier yitzhak shamir on tuesday praised 
the united states for denying arafat a visa saying the plo did not 
genuinely desire peace with israel he told a luncheon of israeli 
newspaper editors that shultz made a brave decision based on a 
longstanding commitment to fight terror 
many arab and other nations argue that arafat deserves to be 
heard because of what they say is a more moderate stance taken 
earlier this month by the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile 
at its conference in algiers the council issued a declaration of 
independence that included implicit recognition of israel the 
recognition was contained in an acceptance of un resolutions 
recognizing the rights of countries in the region to exist

presidentelect george bush told senate 
republican leaders tuesday he will seek speedy confirmation of his 
cabinet perhaps with hearings beginning even before he takes office 
on jan 20 
bush also told the gop senators he hopes any honeymoon period 
with congress can yield a federal budget compromise according to 
participants in a private getacquainted meeting at the capitol 
sen alan simpson rwyo said the presidentelect indicated he 
wanted to meet with a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts 
before submitting a budget outline of his own 
however sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate 
finance committee and the 1988 democratic vice presidential 
candidate said bush should not be in the position of not sending 
any budget up 
this will be his first test of leadership he has to show what 
he believes in national defense medicare revenues he has to 
speak to the principal points of the budget thats part of the 
price of leadership bentsen said they just won an election 
its theirs to call 
republican senators said the vice president indicated during 
their meeting that he would take up the matter of early 
confirmations with the senates newly chosen majority leader george 
mitchell of maine bush called mitchell to congratulate him shortly 
after tuesdays secretballot election among senate democrats 
bush is to meet with mitchell on thursday sandwiched between 
meetings wednesday and friday with jesse jackson and michael 
dukakis two democrats who spent much of the year criticizing 
republicans in general and bush in particular 
dukakis and bush will talk at the vice presidents residence 
friday afternoon in their first meeting since bush defeated the 
massachusetts governor for the presidency three weeks ago 
bush aide steve hart said the jackson meeting was in keeping 
with what george bush has traditionally done which is to be open 
and talk to people who are interested and concerned 
in 1981 the senate then controlled by the republicans voted 
confirmation of key appointments of president reagans within hours 
of his inauguration democrats now have a majority in the senate 
it would be important to his administration if he could have 
early action on confirmation particularly with some of the key 
people like james baker bushs choice for secretary of state 
said sen thad cochran rmiss 
cochran said that if democrats went along confirmation hearings 
could be held on bushs nominations before they are formally 
submitted 
the congress does come into session on jan 3 we could do some 
work between then and the inauguration cochran said 
he said that bush indicated he would like the senate to 
expedite the hearings and consideration of those nominees to those 
cabinet positions so that when the president is inaugurated they 
started to work right away with the cabinet in place 
three members of reagans cabinet that bush has indicated he will 
retain attorney general dick thornburgh education secretary lauro 
f cavazos and treasury secretary nicholas brady do not require 
reconfirmation by the senate 
in other developments tuesday 
a source close to the bush transition speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said a decision by bush on defense secretary 
could come by wednesday the source said bush still favors former 
sen john tower of texas but that some bush advisers are objecting 
partly because they do not have a high regard for close tower 
associates likely to get choice pentagon jobs 
other sources said that samuel k skinner chairman of the 
regional transportation authority in the chicago area is emerging 
as the leading candidate for transportation secretary skinner a 
former us attorney and close associate of illinois gov james 
thompson was bushs state campaign director during the presidential 
campaign this year and in l980 
in his meeting with senate republicans bush reiterated a promise 
to work with both democrats and republicans in forging a budget 
agreement perhaps beginning before his inauguration 
while the senators shied away from using the term budget 
summit they indicated thats pretty much what bush has in mind 
i think its going to develop that way but i dont know the 
timing said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
bush said that he was in a listening mode in his second trip 
to capitol hill since his election his first was two weeks ago 
when he met with house speaker jim wright 
on tuesday bush said im getting the message rather than 
carrying advice 
were ready to go to work ready to work with the new 
administration dole said after the breakfast session we 
pledged our cooperation hes pledged his 
bush brought his choices for chief of staff and budget director 
new hampshire gov john sununu and richard darman 
on another subject bush was asked by reporters if he supported 
moves to hold a special meeting of the un general assembly in 
geneva 
there should be a un meeting and there will be a un meeting 
on that subject bush said 
he did not elaborate the reagan administration has said it is 
neutral on the subject of whether such a meeting should be held in 
geneva to give yasser arafat the chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization a forum to plead the palestinian cause 
the united states has refused to give arafat a visa to address 
the united nations at its new york headquarters bush aides said he 
was not consulted on the state department decision to bar arafats

should be extradited to the united states to stand trial for a 
string of sex murders in california 
justice marguerite trussler of alberta court of queens bench 
decided that the former us marine born in hong kong should be 
extradited on 19 of the 25 offenses he is charged with in 
california she said she would issue a warrant that would keep ng in 
prison in canada until he is surrendered to us authorities 
charges of murder kidnapping and burglary have been filed 
against ng in california he is accused in the murders of 12 people 
eleven of the deaths of men women and children involved grisly 
sex slayings at a rural cabin in calaveras county 120 miles east of 
san francisco the 12th involved the death of a san francisco disc 
jockey 
ng could face the gas chamber if convicted 
defense lawyer don macleod said he will appeal judge trusslers 
ruling macleod said earlier arguments could take the case all the 
way to the supreme court of canada which could take up to five 
years 
ng whose name is pronounced ing faces possible execution in 
california his lawyers are seeking to invoke a provision in the 
canadaus extradition treaty that says extradition may be refused 
unless the requesting state guarantees the fugitive will not be 
executed if convicted canada does not have the dealth penalty 
ng who was educated in british private schools is serving a 
4year sentence at a maximumsecurity federal penitentiary in

evidence filed during a sixweek extradition hearing that the 
offenses charged in the state of california are extraditable with 
one exception 
the exception was a charge of accessory to murder

conspiracy to kidnap because no evidence was shown of transportation 
of the three people involved as required under canadian law 
she ruled evidence from ngs alleged partner in the crimes 
leonard lake should be admissible 
ng came to canada after lake was picked up for shoplifting in san 
francisco and committed suicide lake later was linked to the deaths 
or disappearances of 22 people that investigation led to the 
charges against ng 
i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the 
evidence that there was a general conspiracy that related to 
weapons money and sexual gratification she held

israeli soldiers in the occupied lands wounded 
20 palestinians tuesday hospital officials said and merchants were 
caught between one faction demanding a strike and another insisting 
they stay open 
among the wounded were a 10yearold boy shot in the leg and a 
14yearold hit in the chest the arab hospital officials said 
more than 7000 palestinians have been wounded in a year of 
rebellion against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip at least 316 have been killed and 11 israelis have been slain 
gangs of young islamic extremists and plo activists armed with 
knives and clubs marched through bethlehem in the west bank on 
tuesday shouting threats at each other and issuing conflicting 
orders 
members of hamas zeal sprayed a warning to merchants on walls 
in islamic green today is a strike day be sure you observe it 
followers of the palestine liberation organization kicked on 
closed doors shouting to store owners that they would be protected 
from hamas if they opened 
the strike was widely observed in the west bank and gaza hebron 
a predominantly fundamentalist west bank town was completely shut 
down 
army commanders strengthened patrols and imposed curfews on more 
than two dozen refugee camps towns and villages at least 370000 
of the 15 palestinians in the territories were confined to their 
homes 
at the root of tuesdays factional conflict was a disagreement 
between hamas and yasser arafats fatah faction of the plo over the 
proclamation nov 15 of an independent palestinian state 
the declaration is based on a 1947 un partition plan that 
called for both arab and a jewish states in palestine 
hamas rejected it and called a protest strike for tuesday the 
41st anniversary of the partition plan the unified national 
leadership of the uprising backed by the plo did not call for a 
strike 
in a recent leaflet hamas leaders said how is it possible to 
think that jews want a just peace the jew is a jew regardless of 
the party he belongs to 
three masked hamas followers in jericho a west bank town 
flagged down arabrun buses en route to jerusalem and forced them to 
turn back arab witnesses reported the young men entered the buses 
and shouted at the drivers go back go back 
stores were closed in ramallah north of jerusalem 
one shopkeeper told reporters other merchants complied after 
being threatened by hamas loyalists an elderly man later advised 
him dont tell these things to outsiders 
another group urging a strike tuesday was the prosyrian popular 
front for the liberation of palestine which also rejected the 
independence declaration 
palestinian leaders expressed concern about the growing rift and 
said it might harm the uprising in the territories israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in 1967 
we know about the risk of this confrontation we are working to 
stop it said sufian khatib a palestinian surgeon whose views 
have been identified with those of the popular front 
khatib also said the coinciding strike calls did not indicate a 
new alliance between fundamentalists and hardline plo factions 
opposed to even implicit recognition of israel 
we have some points in common but we are not together in the 
field he told the associated press 
another palestinian official said the independence declaration by 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo legislature 
had wide support in the occupied lands 
a majority of the palestinian people are behind the pnc said 
mahdi abdulhadi head of the palestinian academic society for the 
study of international affairs 
armed jewish settlers in the northern west bank launched highway 
patrols on tuesday to protect israeli drivers from being stoned by 
palestinians three cars patrolled the roads each bearing a large 
israeli flag said organizer yacov eshel 
he said soldiers stopped one car at an army checkpoint near the 
palestinian town of qalqiliya and told the driver he could not enter 
unless he removed the flag the driver refused and was turned back

there arent just american hostages in lebanon but there also 
are iranian hostages who are in the hands of christian 
militiamen mohammed javad larijani irans deputy foreign 
minister said 
he made the comment after meeting with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher whose threeday visit to tehran was 
dominated by the hostage issue 
larijani was refering to three iranians who disappeared with 
their lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped by 
christian phalangist gunmen the four are widely believed to have 
died no group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping 
western nations especially the united states have close ties 
to the phalangists larijani told reporters we want all 
hostages to be free the iranians as well and we will work as much 
as we can so that they are freed 
he did not specify what actions iran might take 
in remarks quoted by the official islamic republic news agency 
and monitored in cyprus larijani also did not rule out resuming 
ties with the united states 
if one day we were to resume ties with the us such a 
relationship would certainly be on the basis of mutual respect and 
noninterference in each others affairs he was quoted as saying 
genscher has offered to act as mediator in gaining the release of 
14 foreign hostages including nine americans believed held in 
lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem extremists west german 
government sources in bonn said 
genschers good contacts with tehran throughout the iraniraq war 
were seen as key factors in the release of two west german hostages 
held in lebanon 
before ending his visit on tuesday genscher told reporters he 
urged irans leaders to to use all possibilities toward 
contributing to the release of all hostages in lebanon 
during his stay genscher held talks with larijani president ali 
khamenei foreign minister ali akbar velayati and other iranian 
officials 
genscher said he raised the hostage issue in each of his 
discussions 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
tuesday that genscher is not an emissary of the united states 
and is not representing the us government in the discussions in 
iran he is not speaking in our behalf the spokesman said 
obviously were interested to hear whatever comes up in these 
talks fitzwater said adding that im not aware of any new 
hope for release of the american hostages 
longest held of the 14 hostages is terry anderson 41 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
in addition peter winkler 32 a swiss employee of the red 
cross was abducted by three unidentified gunmen nov 17 in sidon 
25 miles south of beirut no group claimed responsibility 
earlier tuesday genscher and velayati signed a cultural 
agreement designed to lead to the reopening of the 
governmentsponsored goethe institute in tehran the institute 
provides information on german culture and language instruction 
genscher was accompanied to iran by a 30member delegation that 
included west german industry leaders one purpose of the visit was 
to discuss ways to help iran rebuild its warravaged economy 
west germany is one of irans most important trade partners 
iran and iraq who began fighting in september 1980 agreed to a 
united nationssponsored truce in august and have been negotiating 
for a lasting peace

in an age when half the marriages fall apart 
when commitments to that bond come hard and many delay it or shun it 
entirely a virginia theologian offers a paean to marriages beauty 
the rev edward stone gleason sees it as next to heaven itself 
while he recognizes it doesnt eliminate the sorrows and 
difficulties of life he finds in marriage the balm that eases those 
hurts and gives a glow of wonder to all existence 
to be married means to be redeemed he says to be married 
is to be loved only for who we are not who we might wish to be or 
who we might seem to be 
it is he says to be a new creation 
in a book redeeming marriage recently issued by cowley 
publications of cambridge mass gleason extols marriage in often 
lyrical terms comparable to the biblical song of solomon 
night had become the time to feel close in touch arms and 
legs wrapped around the other the only one he writes the one 
who knows me and who i am and what i feel and even who i would be 
day means assuming a role playing a part at night it was 
all real the time just at dawn had a different kind of magic 
without her there would be no dawn for there would be no reason 
to rise to greet the day even to have a day 
gleason takes an unusual approach to his subject interspersing 
descriptions of marriage and episodes from it with lines of the 
marriage ritual in the episcopal book of common prayer and scripture 
passages 
a professor at the episcopal virginia theological seminary he 
recognizes the strains of life describing various marriage 
breakdowns causes behind them and also the restorative help of 
friends 
but mostly he tells of the bracing grandeur of marriage itself 
we offer ourselves to our spouse and are known fully and 
accepted and loved it is not acceptance of what we might wish 
to be but of who we actually are it is grace in all its 
fullness 
such acceptance results in a sense of worth selfworth which 
is given by the one to the other somehow this make it possible to 
mean something be something even do something 
every moment every word every action suddenly come into being 
in a new way strange and wonderful quite mysterious one is unable 
to function fully without the other 
the ancient and most holy miracle to be loved one plus one 
equals a thousand 
novelisttheologian frederick buechner says of gleasons 
analysis in an age that tends to take marriage lightly and 
cynically his high view of it reminds us of what at its richest 
it can become 
gleason says the ancient biblical image in genesis of a man and 
woman becoming one flesh is the powerful and miraculous truth of 
marriage 
that gift is beyond any other experience available to us he 
says as close as human beings may come to know the reality of 
heaven this side of the grave 
he points out decisively and quite happily the disciplines 
required of a genuine marriage including patience unswerving 
fidelity and total unconditional commitment to the other 
nothing is to be reserved or held back the old cliche that 
marriage will only work if each reserves a small corner of the self 
as private never to be shared is erroneous and worse dangerous 
for that small and reserved part will grow and grow and grow 
until it destroys the marriage 
children arent the main object of marriage he says noting that 
marriage exists before they come and after theyre grown and gone 
the essential fruit of marriage is the joy of becoming one 
flesh that miracle has nothing to do with children the gift of 
marriage is the gift of one another 
gleason deals plainly and gracefully with the sexuality of 
marriage saying that any marriage without sex is dying or dead but 
he emphasizes that other qualities must precede and underly it 
saying 
the first is affection the most basic love a part of every 
love and no love is possible without it affection is built upon 
familiarity time spent together time which binds two persons 
toether in common experience 
the second is friendship a relationship moves from the 
familiarity of affection to the desire to develop common bonds 
common understandings common hopes and dreams 
the third is eros sexual passion it is not lust which is 
blind eros seeks one particular person and one person only 
striving for fusion with that other eros will not occur unless 
first one has experienced affection and then friendship 
the fourth is agape the love of god it is a love which 
sees and knows us just as we are and loves us still and all 
marriage includes all four loves

harry smiths arm shoots up in the air 
midsentence and he snaps his fingers 
you know what it was ill tell you what it was the seed was 
planted in high school because i had an english teacher and we had 
to write a term paper i couldnt come up with anything and the 
teacher john gulassa said heres some books why dont you read 
these and see what you think and he gave me on the road by jack 
kerouac 
that was the beginning of the end for me you know the 
beginning of the end which turned out to be the great beginning 
smith 37 was searching his memory for the genesis of the story 
of how a kid from a small bluecollar town in the midwest found 
himself in new york city as cohost of a network morning news show 
cbs this morning celebrates its first anniversary this week 
though it is still struggling in the ratings behind nbcs today 
and abcs good morning america smith and cohost kathleen 
sullivan have developed an easygoing rapport and the network seems 
content to let them develop a following 
the pressure doesnt seem to get to smith the most likely 
successor to charles kuralt as cbs resident laidback philosopher 
smiths feetontheground attitude comes from deep midwestern 
roots and a strict religious upbringing his father worked two jobs 
as a policeman and a milkman smith was the youngest of eight 
children most of whom got married pretty young and went out into 
the world and got real jobs and had real lives smith said i 
was the youngest and kind of the surprise i got a little bit more 
attention than the other ones did had a rich fantasy life about 
doing something other than going to work at the youngstown sheet and 
tool 
most of those fantasies revolved around television 
i used to watch jack paar and just used to be fascinated by 
characters like oscar levant smith said certainly in my realm 
of existence there wasnt anyone real like that and wouldnt it be 
interesting to meet people and know people like that 
despite a budding interest in literature and philosophy smith 
went to college on a football scholarship and planned to be a 
highschool football coach he attended central college in pella 
iowa an intellectually dangerous place for a young jock he 
said because they said here are books how would you like to 
read them and so i did and my notions about being a football 
coach were shortlived 
he graduated with a degree in communications and theater after a 
stint as a public tv talkshow host in denver he moved over to 
kmghtv the cbs affiliate there he anchored the noon news with 
another reporter andrea joyce their courtship sounds right out of 
broadcast news 
we were just buds smith said we worked very hard and were 
very careeroriented and all that sort of stuff so professional 
that neither of us would have ever considered going out we used to 
convenience date you know ive got this thing to go to would 
you go with me just go with me 
a convenience date to the opera led to romance and later 
marriage 
smith was a dallasbased correspondent for cbs when he was tapped 
for cbs this morning even though it means getting up at 4 am 
smith says the schedule at least is regular and has allowed for a 
second honeymoon joyce now reports for madison square garden 
network they go to central park everyday with their wirehaired fox 
terrier 
i dont know if i can do it forever i saw where jane pauley 
celebrated 12 years and i dont know if i could do that smith 
said 
his favorite part of the job is most like being a correspondent 
going on the road to cover every kind of news story from political 
conventions to hurricanes 
theres gonna be a time when i just do that again smith 
said doesnt have to be next year or the year after theres a 
time down the line when im going to go back and maybe thats what 
ill do for a living ill be a correspondent based somewhere

what this market of corporate stocks needs is 
liquidity said the professor and he went on to suggest that the 
corporations themselves consider providing it 
the professors observation has its origins in the debacle of 
oct 19 1987 when the dow jones industrial average dropped 
hundreds of points in a few hours devouring about onehalf trillion 
dollars of value 
now thats illiquidity said the professor there were sellers 
everywhere and almost no buyers and many of the specialists who 
are supposed to buy when others are selling were swamped by the 
avalanche 
it could have been worse says professor robert a schwartz in 
fact it would have been worse if companies hadnt used their own 
cash to buy back their own stocks he feels they helped turn a tide 
that could have destroyed the market 
observing those actions the professor developed a detailed plan 
to eliminate excess volatility in securities markets by asking 
listed companies to establish permanent stabilization funds 
these funds would remain on the sidelines invested in us 
treasury notes until they were needed and that need would be 
determined by a precipitous drop in stock prices 
schwartz who teaches economics and finance at new york 
university would have the companies enter the market to buy a 
preset number of shares when the price of their shares fell to a 
certain level 
he offers this example 
xyz corp has 100 million shares outstanding at an average share 
price of 5250 it decides to stabilize prices by buying 100000 
shares if the price drops 250 to 50 a share and sell 100000 
shares in a comparable rise 
the transactions would be triggered only when the price rose or 
fell by an increment of 250 if the efforts failed to stabilize 
prices then the company would be prepared to buy another block at 
4750 or sell at 5750 
the company would be prepared to buy shares at each 250 
increment down to a total price drop of 30 a share for xyz corp 
this would require a stabilization fund of a little more than 42 
million 
schwartz author of the recently published equity markets 
structure trading and performance justifies his thesis by 
stating that the only way to stabilize a market is to commit capital 
to market making 
the result of his plan he says would be more stable markets 
increased investor confidence and perhaps a bonus for the 
corporations 
he explains that the stabilization funds themselves might 
generate positive cash flows because participating companies would 
realize gains from routine buying and selling at certain price 
intervals 
in effect they would emulate the work of the successful 
specialists making their profits from the spread between bid and 
asked prices 
should such a plan work it might encourage individual investors 
to return to the market which they fled in droves after and some 
smart ones before the october 1987 debacle one of their main 
fears has been volatility 
schwartz whose proposal was published in the fall 1988 issue of 
the journal of portfolio management believes the stock market 
remains overly volatile because of insufficient liquidity 
he suggests that the liquidity added by the corporations 
themselves would serve to mitigate sharp moves in at least two ways 
first by the infusion of money and then by assuring owners to hold 
firm rather than dump 
to avoid any corporate manipulation of stocks he would allow the 
buy and sell orders to be entered only upon market openings and 
reopenings and would have exchange officials supervise the 
transactions

that recurring old battle over who is a jew 
appeared this week to be headed toward some kind of temporary 
compromise or at least less than an intrajewish breakup despite 
the verbal fireworks 
in certain quarters harsh words still were being traded over the 
issue 
but several signs have shown up both in this country and israel 
that some sort of stopgap arrangement or avoidance of an outright 
breach may be in the making 
the question has heated up many times over the last two decades 
usually in connection with israels political splintering which 
often has parties dickering with each other for sufficient clout to 
govern 
the issue boiled to a head this month as a result of israels 
latest inconclusive elections in which neither major party the 
rightwing likud nor labor won a clear majority 
that left the orthodox religious parties who won a substanial 
minority of parliamentary seats holding the power to tilt the 
balance either way and to inject their demand for defining 
jewishness 
they contend that converts to judaism are validly jews only if 
converted under orthodox rules thus excluding those converted in 
reform or conservative judaism embracing most american jews 
as repeatedly sought through the years the orthodox parties want 
israels law of return offering automatic citizenship to all 
jews amended to apply to converts only if recognized by orthodoxy 
that would cut out the reform and conservative converts 
obviously relatively small in numbers but raising a highly charged 
principle of equity for the three wings of judaism 
in any case the outcry has come hot and furious from reform 
conservative and u s secular jewish organizations charging such a 
change would rend the fabric of jewish unity and erode us ties to 
israel 
at the same time some ultraorthodox groups have called the 
outburst an antiorthodox hate campaign engaged in 
mudslinging at orthodox jews 
however there were some tempering hints in the wind 
leaders of 2l national us jewish organizations reform 
conservative and secular were in israel this week making their 
rounds to try to head off the moves toward a showdown 
delegation spokesmen said that in a surprising development both 
of israels orthodox chief rabbis who support the orthodox 
political parties requested meetings with the us group 
meanwhile a main us orthodox body the rabbinical council of 
america voiced an unusual conciliatory note 
it joined in urging that the question of who is a jew be resolved 
not by a political body like israels knesset parliament but by 
discussion among jewish groups 
in israel labyrinthine political maneuvering prime minister 
shamir to gain support of the orthodox parties and give likud a 
majority at one point reportedly promised them their longsought 
change in the law of return 
but later he was reported bidding for renewing a shaky coalition 
with foreign minister shimon peres labor party which has seemed 
reluctant about it but later indicated flexibility 
it also needed allies to forge any governing front 
beyond these religious and political shiftings indicating some 
chance at some resolution that wont split jewish ranks an american 
leader said that whatever the outcome it should not undermine 
support for israel 
rabbi alexander schindler head of reform judaism which had 
voiced keen outrage at the threat to rule out jewish coverts other 
than those of orthodoxy said 
american jews must not permit the political controversy over 
who is a jew to turn us away from israel or to weaken our resolve to 
defense its cause 
he implored israels leaders to put jewish unity before 
considerations of political expendency and avoid any action that 
would shatter the solidarity that binds the jewish people 
everywhere to israel but he added 
today we must fight against any change in the law of return 
with every resource at our command and at the same time we must 
stand with the people of israel as if there were no political power 
brokers who would read us out of the jewish fold

when it gave birth to western civilization 
the mediterranean was the world ecologists today are calling it a 
paradise lost 
ravaged by man over the centuries the face of the mediterranean 
has been scarred lush forests felled wildlife silenced 
mineralrich soil long gone aquamarine currents fouled by oil 
slicks 
but some of the regions leading thinkers are trying to 
rediscover a mediterranean identity through the only common bond 
they can find a determination to save whats left of the 
mediterraneans environment 
its a region whose contribution is acknowledged by the world 
but whose future lies in doubt wrote serge antoine international 
relations adviser for frances environment ministry 
antoine among 60 delegates who discussed the state of the 
mediterranean at a recent international conference in cairo 
sponsored by the romebased aspen institute italia called on the 
regions 18 countries to unite their cultural and political wills to 
shape a brighter future 
the institute a branch of the aspen institute for humanistic 
studies of aspen colo brings together political economic and 
cultural leaders to discuss current issues 
a clear message emerged from the conference the only way to 
solve environmental social economic and political ills of the area 
is to find common ground uniting the diverse cultures tied by 
geography to the mediterranean sea 
theres only one issue that can join us now and thats the 
environment gianni de michelis italys deputy prime minister and 
president of the italian institute said in an interview 
despite the vast differences between industrialized countries 
that border the northern mediterranean and lessdeveloped countries 
bordering the south everybody agrees we have to do something about 
the environment its the only rallying point we have the one issue 
public opinion can use to force politicians to act 
delegates from europe north africa and the united states said 
the mediterranean region has greater potential for environmental 
progress than most because of its manageable size and historical 
links its countries share 
they agreed however that despite the work of numerous local and 
international agencies governments arent doing enough 
a major topic of the conference was the mediterranean action

the mediterranean basin is among the most developed regions in 
the world despite its varied cultures but its population and 
industry are shifting rapidly toward its fragile coastlines tourism 
is increasing greatly throughout the region and almost half the 
millions of annual tourists remain along the coast 
the basin has 29000 miles of seacoast only 40 percent of which 
is flat usable land 
additionally population is growing unevenly declining slightly

christmas on sunday

with a career and the youngest is in college plus there are three 
grandchildren can you believe that 
in the story mike and i try to give each other surprise trips 
i choose greece he chooses japan instead we decide to bring all 
the kids home 
the brady bunch was the kind of television project that the 
networks squeezed until they got everything out of it 
the original series ran on abc from 1969 to 74 from 1972 to 
74 the brady kids was an animated saturday morning show on 
abc next it was a variety show the brady bunch hour on abc 
in 1977 then in 1981 nbc telecast the movie the brady girls get 
married followed by a brief series called the brady brides 
the brady kids also put out a musical album 
its amazing said henderson someone brought a brady 
bunch lunch pail for me to sign theyd been offered 800 for it i 
dont know why the bradys keep coming back i went to australia and 
theyre popular there 
i guess its because theyre a family that gets along and works 
out its problems i think people get some help from it i know when 
i was a child seeing movie musicals saved my life i was the 
youngest of 10 and we were poor i could go to the theater and 
forget my childhood problems it gives people something to strive 
for 
henderson who has four children has been married for the past 
year to dr john kappas a hypnotherapist they live aboard a 
70foot yacht the big flo which is moored at marina del rey when 
theyre not cruising

appearances on the love boat she also was on an afterschool 
special and was a suspect on murder she wrote 
working on a series forces you into a monastic way of life 
she said you work from early in the morning to late at night i 
enjoyed it but after the bradys i guess the right thing never 
came along i dont miss it 
henderson said that although shes the host of a cooking show 
its the guests who do the cooking 
its a comedy and country music show with cooking she said 
id started in country music so it was interesting to get back to 
my roots when i grew up in indiana and kentucky that was the music 
we had at home i sang with a country band in high school we have 
as guests people like willie nelson and pearl bailey when youre

consumers with loans pegged to the prime interest 
rate can expect to see higher borrowing costs soon but analysts 
arent sure whether that will translate into tighter purse strings 
during the holiday season 
the nations biggest banks boosted their base lending rates by a 
half percentage point to 105 percent on monday the highest level 
since mid1985 and the fourth boost this year 
many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent 
weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising 
due to inflation speculation and the dollars weakness in foreign 
exchange 
it comes as no surprise in fact they banks seem to have 
held back longer than i expected said edward yardeni chief 
economist for prudentialbache securities inc 
the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money 
including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates of 
deposit and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates 
the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for 
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining many 
types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans such as home 
equity loans 
its clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing 
costs in december or early next year said william v sullivan an 
economist for the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
but some economists said it was unclear whether the rate hike 
adversely would affect the economy specifically consumer buying 
habits during the important holiday season 
james l kochan chief fixedincome strategist for merrill lynch 
capital markets inc said i think the direct effect is pretty 
small because generally consumers arent affected by modest 
increases in interest rates 
but yardeni said some consumers might cut back on spending and 
buy only things that they can afford 
theres an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many 
people have been through rough times even when the economy was 
strong the prime rate hike coming into the christmas season may 
make people more cautious he said 
the financial markets had no major reaction to mondays 
announcement stock and bond prices rose modestly while the dollar 
firmed against other major currencies in foreign exchange 
sullivan said the markets also are prepared for further increases 
in interest rates 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan has warned of 
higher shortterm rates unless lawmakers work to trim the huge 
federal budget deficit a key factor in the recent weakening of the 
dollar 
theres a building perception in the marketplace that the fed 
is in fact tightening conditions sullivan said 
sullivan and other economists predicted the fed might soon raise 
its discount rate or the interest it charges on loans to banks and 
if that happens the banks might raise rates again 
id look for something from the fed in the next two weeks 
said yardeni 
chase manhattan was the first institution to announce the prime 
hike monday and several other major banks joined the move 
the prime stood at 85 percent at the beginning of this year and 
the banks have raised it four times since then mondays increase 
put the key lending rate at its highest level since may 20 1985 
when the banks lowered it a half percentage point to 10 percent

the impact of the recent wave of leveraged 
buyouts is evident in forbes magazines list of the nations 400 
largest private companies which was topped for the fourth straight 
year by commodities giant cargill 
forbes said in its dec 12 issue that 40 entries on the list were 
public companies that went private in 1988 compared with 21 on the 
list last year including such well known businesses as trans world 
airlines and montgomery ward 
minneapolisbased cargills 1987 revenue totaled 382 billion 
forbes reports in its dec 12 issue that was up nearly 6 billion 
or 18 percent from the previous year and was more than double that 
of the second largest company on the list koch industries the 
wichita kanbased oil company that had sales of 16 billion 
continental grain of new york and safeway stores of oakland 
calif were tied for third with 13 billion in sales united parcel 
service of greenwich conn was fifth at 97 billion 
among those entering the list as a result of leveraged buyouts 
were dallasbased southland ranked no 6 with 85 billion in sales 
and the biggest newcomer to the rankings 
montgomery ward bell amp howell duracell singer and trans world 
airlines were among other wellknown companies that crossed the line 
into private ownership in 1988 
forbes based its list on revenues for fiscal 1987 some of which 
were reported by the companies and some of which were estimated by 
the magazine 
total revenue of the 400 companies rose 17 percent to 523 
billion in 1988 from 1987 forbes said by comparison combined 
sales for the 400 largest public companies in the united states rose 
74 percent in the past year to 26 trillion 
a private company is one with no publicly traded common stock 
either because it has too few common shareholders to file with the 
securities amp exchange commission or if it files its stock is 
unavailable to the general public 
the number of people employed at forbes 400 private companies 
totaled 37 million up 14 percent from last years 32 million 
united parcel service leads the list with 170000 employees 
serviceoriented companies and those that turn over their assets

philip morris cos inc says the federal 
government has cleared its 126 billion purchase of kraft inc a 
deal that would make it the worlds biggest consumer products 
company 
the tobacco and foods giant said monday that the federal trade 
commission had declined to raise antitrust objections to the buyout 
the lone remaining hurdle to the deal is obtaining sufficient 
shares under terms of philip morris 106ashare tender offer 
which it reaffirmed would expire at 5 pm est friday 
the company said about 498 percent of krafts estimated 1193 
million common shares and share equivalents had been tendered as of 
last friday and analysts said they had little doubt the takeover 
would be completed 
previously philip morris valued the transaction at about 131 
billion but said monday that it had has found there were fewer 
common shares and equivalents outstanding than it had expected 
nonetheless the acquisition still would be the biggest buyout to 
date outside the oil business only the 134 billion takeover of 
gulf oil by what now is chevron corp in 1984 was larger and that 
could soon be surpassed as 20 billionplus bids are being weighed 
for rjr nabisco inc 
philip morris said monday the waiting period for the ftcs review 
of the proposed takeover had expired on friday 
asked the significance of that development philip morris 
spokesman george l knox said it meant the ftc had not challenged 
the deal we can proceed with our tender offer he said 
critics had argued that the size of the deal would hurt consumers 
by giving philip morris too much influence over prices supply 
systems and advertising time 
in washington ftc director anna davis would neither confirm nor 
deny the philip morris statement she said the commission had a 
policy of not commenting on such matters unless it blocked a merger 
or granted early termination of the required waiting period for 
antitrust review 
in new york stock exchange trading kraft rose 62 cents a share 
to 10562 and philip morris fell 37 cents a share to 9537 
the philip morris deal would bring wellknown kraft brands such 
as miracle whip salad dressing velveeta cheese sealtest ice cream 
and tombstone frozen pizzas into the same corporate corral as 
marlboro cigarettes maxwell house coffee post cereals oscar mayer 
meats and miller beer 
david goldman who follows the food business for the securities 
firm fahnestock amp co said the acquisition may result in improved 
distribution of kraft products in secondary outlets where philip 
morris general foods subsidiary is already strong 
he said kraft and general foods products also may turn up more 
often in network television advertising as philip morris uses its 
extra spending clout to drive harder bargains for ad time 
goldman said consumers also may see philip morris use coupons to 
guide consumers to its new products 
you might buy a pound of cracker barrel cheese and get a coupon 
for jello pudding or buy miller beer and get a free coupon for a 
kraft snack goldman said 
despite the expansion of its food business philip morris still 
will be chiefly a tobacco company 
john maxwell jr the food tobacco and beverage analyst for 
wheat first securities in richmond va said nontobacco businesses 
will contribute about 35 percent of philip morris operating 
earnings up from 25 percent without kraft 
the takeover agreement announced oct 31 would create the worlds 
largest consumer products company vaulting philip morris past 
unilever nv the britishdutch concern that had been the largest 
with 1987 sales of nearly 31 billion 
philip morris had 277 billion in sales in 1987 while kraft had 
revenues of 99 billion giving the combined company a theoretical 
total of 376 billion

beset by resurgent inflation high interest rates 
and a record trade deficit the british economic rebound that eight 
months ago was considered a miracle has turned into a problem for 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
in march lawson was hailed as an economic wizard who had cured 
the british disease of high inflation high unemployment and high 
interest rates 
but last week government figures showed the current account 
deficit had quadrupled to 243 billion pounds about 45 billion 
in october 
the news prompted british banks to boost interest rates for the 
ninth time since june rattling the stock market and raising the 
prospect of higher borrowing costs for consumers and industry 
now the governments policies and lawsons political future are 
being questioned not only by such traditional critics the 
opposition labor party but also by some members of lawsons own 
conservative party 
with conservative mps members of parliament grumbling about 
soaring mortgage costs and labor convinced that the government at 
last is vulnerable over the handling of the economy the gossip at 
westminster has reached a fevered pitch the financial times wrote 
recently 
lawson is defending his strategy of using higher interest rates 
to choke off inflation which prime minister margaret thatcher says 
is her top economic priority 
but critics say the strategy does not yet appear to be working 
is a painful way to cure britains economic ills and could lead to a 
recession 
critics say the economic ills stem from the consumer boom sparked 
partly by tax cuts that lawson announced in march 
the sweeping tax cuts reduced the top income tax rate from 60 
percent to 40 percent and the base rate from 27 percent to 25 
percent 
the higher interest rates are intended to fight inflation by 
discouraging that consumption which fuels inflation and attracts 
imports and to squeeze corporate profits by boosting the pound 
thus discouraging inflationary pay raises 
but the higher rates which some economists say must go even 
higher before they will work also mean a stronger pound which 
hurts exports higher rates also boost mortgage costs which helps 
increase inflation 
some economists say inflation which was 33 percent in january 
will top 8 percent lawson believes it will peak at 7 percent next 
year before falling back the annual inflation rate now is about 64 
percent 
on friday addressing birmingham businessmen lawson said the 
interest rate hike was a clear indication that this government is 
not prepared to take any risks with inflation but he added 
interest rates do take time to have their full effect 
lawson came under particularly sharp attack last friday when the 
government announced the huge current account deficit 
the ensuing interest rate increase brought the benchmark interest 
rate to 13 percent its highest level in more than 3 years stock 
prices plunged more than 2 percent friday and dipped another 07 
percent on monday as measured by the financial times 100stock 
index 
it marked the latest november turmoil for lawson who with five 
years as treasury head has held the office longer than any other 
since world war ii 
in his nov 1 autumn statement an annual speech which is part of 
britains budgetary process lawsons new economic forecasts were 
sharply at odds with his previous predictions 
two weeks later journalists quoted him as suggesting restricting 
government benefits for the elderly the treasury denied the 
reports but when challenged to check its tape recording of the 
remarks said its tape machine had malfunctioned 
conservative john biffen a former cabinet minister said on bbc 
television that lawson clearly has a problem of confidence and 
suggested he was in a very exposed position 
the financial times discounted speculation that lawson was about

the dollar rose slightly against the japanese yen 
today and share prices sharply rebounded on the tokyo stock 
exchange 
the dollar closed at 12215 yen up from mondays close of 12200 
yen the currency opened higher following its advance overnight in 
new york then gradually slid back sources said the bank of japan 
bought dollars to stabilize the currency when it was about to fall 
below the 122yen mark in the early afternoon the central bank does 
not comment on its activities 
dealers attributed the dollars rise in new york to the increase 
monday in the us prime interest rate from 10 percent to 105 
percent and the agreement by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to reduce production 
opec members meeting in vienna agreed to a daily production quota 
of 185 million barrels and a target price of 18 a barrel 
the announcement triggered a 1abarrel increase in oil prices 
but finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the agreements effect on 
exchange rates was mostly psychological and it would not immediately 
affect the world economy 
mitsuhiko kinugasa of daiwa bank said the dollar fell after its 
initial jump because speculators in tokyo had expected an increase 
in the us prime rate and its occurrence did not change market 
sentiment for a weaker dollar 
many market players still tend to think they should get rid of 
the dollar now kinugasa added 
an exchange dealer with the bank of tokyo speaking anonymously 
said other traders were awaiting the release of us gross national 
product figures for the julyseptember period due later today and 
us unemployment figures for november expected on thursday 
meanwhile the 225issue nikkei stock average regained 33498 
points or 12 percent to return to 2931830 on monday the index 
dropped 38027 points its largest oneday decline since sept 1 
the index gained 7953 points shortly after trading began tuesday 
and advanced further in the afternoon boosted by the stabilized 
currency market dealers said 
volume on the first section was estimated at 11 billion shares 
in active trading

federal regulators are writing new rules 
designed to make savings and loan failures less likely and let the 
government step in before losses get out of hand when an institution 
does go under 
the federal home loan bank board which oversees the nations 
3028 federally insured sampls on monday proposed an early 
intervention plan that would permit it to install new management 
before an institution actually becomes insolvent 
it is also considering regulations requiring institutions with 
riskier real estate and commercial investments to hold more capital 
or reserve funds than institutions investing mostly in residential 
mortgages the traditional mainstay of the thrift industry 
the proposals seek to prevent problems before they arise and to 
resolve those that arise before they cost significant sums 
bank board chairman m danny wall said in a statement 
a draft of the new rules will be formally issued in about two 
weeks by the board which will allow 90 days for public comment 
before taking final action 
capital is the difference between an institutions loans and 
other assets and its deposits and other liabilities an 
institutions losses come out of its capital thus sampls with more 
capital are less likely to fail and require rescue by the government 
deposit insurance fund 
the industrys capital level has fallen dramatically during the 
1980s early in the decade high interest rates ate into profits 
later the collapse of oil prices and southwestern real estate 
pushed many sampls into the red critics say lax capital standards 
made the problem worse 
bank board officials say capital at the typical or median 
institution was 56 percent in 1980 fell to a low of 35 percent in 
1984 and has since rebounded to 52 percent 
the new riskbased rule would require capital of 8 percent by 
january 1993 the current goal is 6 percent with no fixed date set 
for reaching that 
the new policy also would permit regulators to take action when 
an institutions capital falls to 15 percent of assets rather than 
wait until it disappears completely 
roughly 500 institutions are currently considered insolvent at 
the end of september an additional 269 would have been subject to 
bank board action under the 15 percent standard said john 
fiechter managing director for policy in the bank boards 
regulatory office 
the proposed new regulations would give institutions 
concentrating on residential mortgages a break requiring only half 
as much capital for a home mortgage as for a commercial loan it 
would require a fifth as much capital for mortgagebacked securities 
however the standard for direct investments in real estate 
corporate stock and other ventures and for junk bonds is triple the 
standard for commercial loans also institutions that borrow money 
by pledging their assets as collateral would have to raise more 
capital 
if the mix of the industrys investments were to remain 
unchanged the proposal would force a 25 percent increase in sampls 
capital fiechter said 
it will certainly be an incentive for thrifts to stay in their 
traditional business said joseph t lynyak iii an attorney with 
mckenna conner amp cuneo which specializes in financial services law 
the proposal is similar to rules adopted in august by commercial 
bank regulators however unlike the bank rules the sampl rules also 
require institutions more vulnerable to fluctuations in interest 
rates to have more capital 
wendy samuel general counsel for the national council of savings 
institutions a trade group said the industry recognizes the need 
for additional capital tied to risk however she said the bank 
board must adopt measures to encourage capital formation 
the targets are certainly laudable as an ideal she said 
but its going to be a while before its practical youre not 
going to wave a magic wand and declare now theres capital 
bert ely an industry analyst in alexandria va said the 
prospect of increasing capital is poor because most sampls earnings 
are low and the market for their stock is depressed 
where do they regulators think the money is going to come 
from i think theyre going to have a lot of problems 
implementing this he said 
he added that the 269 institutions subject to action under the 
15 percent threshold are going to scream bloody murder 
increasing pressure on congress and regulators to grant exceptions 
from the rules

an american professor who drafted 
proposed economic reforms for chinese officials said he expected 
little more than a handshake and photograph when he was summoned to 
meet with general secretary zhao ziyang 
but james c hsiao 53 a professor of economics and finance at 
southern connecticut state university found himself engaged in a 
frank discussion with the communist party leader the meeting lasted 
nearly 90 minutes and was reported on the front pages of chinese 
newspapers and on television 
the meeting occurred while hsiao a native of china who has lived 
in the united states since 1960 was visiting the hunan province 
late this summer under the auspices of the united nations 
development program 
hsiao was touring a railroad car factory when he received word 
that he was wanted in beijing but he did not learn until after his 
arrival in the capital that it was zhao who wished to speak with him 
i thought it would be just 10 minutes shake hands take your 
picture he said monday 
before leaving the united states hsiao the founder and former 
dean of southern connecticuts business school had mailed a copy of 
his economic proposals to chinese leaders not quite sure who would 
read the 17page document in case officials did not want to read 
the whole thing he included a twopage summary 
hsiao said it was clear from his conversation with zhao that the 
chinese leader had read the entire document 
that impressed me the most he said he was very 
interested 
hsiao said he was told to speak his mind and that the exchange 
sounded like a normal discussion between two economists 
basically i proposed that some staterun enterprises ultimately 
should be given to the people said hsiao 
production would increase if people were made responsible for a 
companys profits and losses he said under the current system he 
said there is no incentive to go beyond quotas and nobody is 
accountable because no one is the boss 
although private enterprise is permitted on a limited basis in 
china hsiao said he told zhao that the government should take 
action to promote such activities entrepeneurs now proceed 
cautiously he said because they fear state intevention 
hsiao also recommended that local government adopt rules and 
regulations protecting the property rights and interests of private 
owners 
according to hsiao the chinese leader agreed that provisions 
should be adopted to promote private enterprise 
hsiao also quoted zhao as saying that china is already moving in 
the general direction he proposed but that the governments actions 
must take into account societys ability to bear radical reforms 
zhao believes that there is only so much that society can 
absorb at a time hsiao said 
the professor said he is cautiously optimistic that china will be 
able to solve its economic problems unlike the situation in the 
soviet union he said people in china are fully aware that their 
future is tied to the success of economic reform

a federal judge has removed the chairman and 
two trustees supervising the 24 billion trust for victims of the 
dalkon shield birth control device after a complaint that they had 
shown bad judgment resulting in inaction and delays 
us district judge robert r merhige jr who is supervising the 
bankruptcy proceeding of the ah robins co on monday ordered the 
immediate removal of barbara b blum of new york the chairman of 
the dalkon shield claimants trust gene locks a lawyer in 
philadelphia and ann samani of lexington ky a former member of 
the dalkon shield claimants committee 
merhige did not outline his reasons for removing the trustees in 
his twopage order but he noted that an opinion would be filed 
today in richmond headquarters of ah robins manufacturer of the 
dalkon shield 
the complaint by claimaints in the case against dalkon shield 
contended the trustees used poor judgement in voting to retain as 
counsel the washington firm of cadwalader wickersham and taft 
which represents the separate dalkon shield claimants committee 
us district judge albert v bryan jr disqualified the firm 
from representing the trust 
the complaint also accused the trustees of taking steps seen as 
being confrontational toward merhiges supervision of their work 
the ousted trustees were among five appointed under ah robins 
bankruptcy plan to set up a method for compensating victims of the 
dalkon shield intrauterine device 
robins filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code in 1985 after hundreds of women filed suit claiming 
the birth control device had killed some women and injured scores of 
others 
under the reorganization plan robins would be acquired by 
american home products corp of new york and would put 23 billion 
in cash into the trust in september lawyers representing more than 
100 claimants asked for removal of the trustees arguing that they 
were inexperienced and had not moved quickly enough to set up a 
claims center 
the lawyers also charged thatms samanis presence on the board 
presented a conflict of interest 
ms samani said she was among the women injured by the dalkon 
shield intrauterine device manufactured in the early 1970s by ah 
robins she withdrew her claim to serve as a trustee merhiges 
order permits her to reinstate her claim 
the remaining trustees washington lawyer kenneth feinberg and 
university of virginia law professor stephen a saltzburg will 
nominate successors the nominations are subject to approval by 
merhige 
michael sheppard director of the trusts claims resolution 
facility said the trusts bylaws will be amended to permit a quorum 
of two trustees to conduct business 
we expect no slowdown sheppard said

indications that quotacheating would 
continue despite opecs new productionlimiting agreement sparked a 
selloff that sharply reduced the gains posted in crude oil prices 
when the pact was reached 
the uncertainty was sparked when the oil minister of the united 
arab emirates mana saeed otaiba said the daily production ceiling 
set by the pact for his country does not represent its official 
quota 
otaibas comments reported by the official emirates news agency 
wam were interpreted as a warning his country might pump more than 
its quota of 988000 barrels a day violations of previous quotas 
have caused chaos on the oil market and a sharp decline in prices 
but on arrival today in baghdad otaiba was quoted as saying his 
country was committed to the opec accord ratified monday 
we are committed to the text and spirit of the accord we 
signed otaiba was quoted as saying by the official iraqi news 
agency the uae signed the accord and it remains committed to 
what it stipulated regarding the production ceiling the production 
quotas and pricing 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude traded as high as 
1580 a barrel before settling at 1503 on monday up 106 from 
wednesdays close 
the market was closed thursday and friday for the thanksgiving 
holiday 
each 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an 
increase of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices although 
oil companies do not necessarily pass along the full increase 
the new agreement by the 13 members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries effective jan 1 aims to curb the 
cartels recent breakneck production reduce the world oil glut and 
drive up crude prices 
the accords success hinges on whether all member countries honor 
the quotas set out for them 
analysts said they expected quota cheating by the united arab 
emirates which is believed to be ignoring its current opec quota 
the country has a new quota of 988000 barrels a day a gain from 
948000 barrels 
analysts estimate the united arab emirates already has been 
producing as much as 2 million barrels a day they say it is 
unlikely it will reduce its output to less than 12 million barrels 
a day 
paul mlotok an analyst for the investment firm salomon brothers 
inc in new york said the new agreement was likely to hold even 
with cheating by the emirates 
as long as that is all they opec wont fare too badly 
mlotok said 
the production agreement was fashioned in nearly two weeks of 
meetings by opec ministers 
under the pact the cartel would limit production in the first 
six months of next year to 185 million barrels a day up from its 
current official ceiling of 166 million barrels but down sharply 
from its actual production estimated at 225 million barrels a day 
it also retains opecs benchmark price of 18 a barrel 
the new deal also brings iraq back into the quota system that 
nation refused to join the current accord arranged in 1986 because 
it wanted the same larger production ceiling as its war rival iran 
the ministers stepped up efforts to set a new quota for iraq 
after iran and iraq agreed in august to a ceasefire in their 8year 
war the two countries now badly need additional oil revenue to 
rebuild their damaged economies 
after lengthy behindthescenes negotiations the ministers gave 
both the same 264 million barrels a day quota iran had a cap of 
24 million barrels under the old agreement and iraq 15 million 
other opec members are saudi arabia algeria ecuador gabon 
indonesia kuwait libya qatar and venezuela

strikebound suburban commuters crowded into scarce 
buses or drove their cars on jammed expressways today while the 
government ordered out army trucks to move stranded passengers 
the strike called by the communistled general confederation of 
labor halted all trains on two of the four regional express networks 
and disrupted subway and bus routes 
the first army vehicles were expected to arrive in the capital 
late today with as many as 400 expected to be on hand for wednesday 
mornings rush hour the defense ministry said 
transport minister michel delebarre announced the military 
intervention on national television monday night and accused the 
union of waging a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment 
this is not in the french union tradition 
delebarre said strikers blocked buses in their terminals 
flattened tires and sabotaged engines the transit agencys 
management was being ordered to stop paying striking workers and to 
start disciplinary proceedings against lawbreakers he said 
general confederation of labor secretarygeneral henri krasucki 
said on french radio today that the government was mistaken if it 
planned to solve the labor dispute with police troops or military 
trucks 
at midday today the paris regional transit agency reported the 
regional a and b lines halted only 60 percent of buses operating 
and service reduced by up to 25 percent on some subway lines 
premier michel rocards socialist government has been hit by 
striking nurses postal employees government office workers and 
other public service employees demanding wage increases that rocard 
says would be inflationary 
the real motive of these strikes is political the 
conservative newspaper le figaro said in todays editorial the 
communists are trying to exert unbearable pressure on the socialists 
with a view toward the municipal elections of next march 
the communist share in recent french elections slipped to less 
than 10 percent of the total vote but the party appears to see a 
chance to grab the role of the only authentic leftist force as the 
socialists continue the economic policies of the conservatives who 
controlled the government from 1986 until last may 
krasucki dismissed repeated suggestions that the strikes were 
intended to increase communist chances in next years municipal 
elections as completely stupid 
his union is demanding increased safety measures and 
acrosstheboard pay increases of 170 a month the transit 
authority sunday offered raises of 4250 a month a typical transit 
worker earns a topscale monthly wage of 1400 
the two regional express lines paralyzed since monday usually 
carry more than 600000 of the roughly 10 million people who commute 
to paris by bus train or car

the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled monday that the case 
should have gone to trial and ordered the case back to us district 
court in pittsburgh which had granted westinghouse a summary 
judgment in the suit by james white 
white was fired in 1986 at age 51 from his engineering position 
as part of a westinghouse plan to reduce its staff by up to 10 
percent according to court records of the nine employees in 
whites department two were older than white 
white had worked for westinghouse for 29 years and nine months 
he contends westinghouse chose him for termination because if he had 
remained on the job three more months he would have been eligible 
for more retirement benefits 
westinghouse maintained that he was chosen because of low 
performance ratings and because his position was the most expendable

chrysler corp will end passenger car production 
at its kenosha wisc plant on dec 23 putting about 5300 people 
out of work a spokesman for the automaker says 
chrysler spokesman lloyd northard said monday that the former 
american motors corp plant would retain a work force of about 1200 
people including 200250 salaried workers in the engine operation 
at kenosha once the car assembly lines shut down 
the kenosha plant now has about 6500 employees including 600 
salaried workers 
after dec 23 chrysler will stop building passenger cars in 
kenosha northard said 
obviously there will be people needed after dec 23 in the 
lbody teardown operation and workers will also be needed to 
dismantle the mbody tooling 
the mbody production is being discontinued by chrysler while 
the lbody production is being shifted to chryslers jefferson 
avenue plant in detroit 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca had announced earlier this year 
that auto production at kenosha would stop by the end of this year 
ed steagall president of united auto workers local 72 at 
kenosha said he thinks chrysler is making a serious mistake by 
shutting down the kenosha car production 
the quality levels and the sales levels are there for both 
the lbody and the mbody lines he said 
he said the union was preparing for the assembly shutdown some 
workers will retire some will relocate and some will return to 
school he said 
its going to be devastating and its terrible that the 
shutdown comes just before christmas he said 
chrysler initially said it would stop some kenosha production by 
july and the rest by september but iacocca later announced car 
production would continue through december because of strong sales

the nations economy grew at a moderate 26 percent annual rate 
in the third quarter tempered by the summer drought the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said the performance of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of the economy slowed in the 
julyseptember period after expanding at an annual rate of 32 
percent during the first six months of the year 
it was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986 when 
the economy grew at a sluggish 14 percent rate the department said 
that without the drought thirdquarter growth would have been a 
strong 32 percent 
the report however represents an upward revision from a 
preliminary estimate last month which pegged growth at 22 percent 
the revisions were about in line with economists expectations and 
fit in with anticipation in the market that the federal reserve will 
soon move to curb inflation by dampening growth with higher interest 
rates 
major banks raised their prime lending rates on monday 
the commerce department also reported today that corporate 
profits rose a slight 02 percent in the third quarter to 1631 
billion the worst performance since a loss in the last quarter of 
1987 
in another report monday the commerce department said the 
imbalance between what the united states imports and exports 
narrowed to 2853 billion in the julyseptember quarter a 54 
percent decline it was the third straight quarterly drop 
through the first nine months of the year the deficit ran at an 
annual rate of 1252 billion compared with last years record 
1603 billion deficit analysts predicted the deficit for all of 
1988 should be at least 20 percent lower than 1987 marking the 
first time since president reagan took office in 1981 that the trade 
deficit has improved 
reagan policymakers have relied heavily on the dollars decline 
in value over the last three years to increase exports by making 
them more affordable abroad and thus help ease the trade deficit 
the commerce department report suggested the strategy has been at 
least partly successful easing some pressure for the dollar to 
decline more 
another event that helped the dollar monday was an organization 
of petroleum exporting countries accord aimed at limiting production 
and raising the price of oil which often is priced in dollars 
higher opec prices raise demand for dollars to pay for the oil 
the opec pact reached in vienna austria was viewed skeptically 
by many industry analysts given the cartels history of violating 
its own agreements but it still pushed oil prices up more than 1 
to the 15abarrel level 
meanwhile major us banks boosted their prime lending rates a 
half percentage point to 105 percent the steepest level since 
mid1985 and the fourth rise this year 
the prime rate rise had been widely expected but some analysts 
said it also contributed to a strengthened dollar which rose in 
value against the japanese yen british pound west german mark and 
other key currencies 
the dollars strength helped the bond market where the 30year 
treasury bond rose about 250 per 1000 in face amount and its 
yield fell to 914 percent from 917 percent friday 
but the impact was hardly felt on wall street where the numbers 
of gaining and losing issues were about even in new york stock 
exchange trading the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 676 
to 208144 and broader market indicators were mixed

a multimilliondollar lawsuit has been filed 
against a greek banker accused in his homeland of embezzling more 
than 135 million and jailed in this country on a fugitive warrant 
the civil racketeering lawsuit seeking at least 34 million was 
filed monday by the bank of crete against george koskotas the 
banks former chairman 
if the bank can prove the racketeering allegation to a jury it 
could seek three times the amount of damages claimed 
us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum froze at least 30 
million of koskotas assets in accounts at merrill lynch and irving 
trust pending a hearing dec 6 
earlier this month koskotas fled greece where he had been 
indicted on five counts of fraud and embezzlement alleging he 
siphoned more than 135 million from the bank 
the scandal has embarrassed the government of premier andreas

the math is simple when too many new cars are 
built and too few are sold incentives result auto analysts say the 
latest round will arrive in time for christmas 
were going to have to have some type of programs analyst 
joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton in new york said monday 
the companies would much rather give away part of the gross profit 
than cut production 
auto giant general motors corp may have a 100day backlog of 
cars by the end of december an inventory nearly 50 percent larger 
than considered comfortable 
if you just look at the recent reactions of the car companies 
to inventory bulges its obvious they will do something 
phillippi said incentives of varying proportions and programs 
have been part of the landscape for four years now 
each of the big three have incentives in effect chrysler corps 
incentives programs have no set expiration many of ford motor cos 
programs are set to expire dec 5 while some gm programs expire 
wednesday 
ford in the best shape of the big three as far as inventories 
go plans to build more cars in the first quarter of 1989 than it 
announced two weeks ago its latest production schedule for the 
first three months of 1989 shows 501000 cars to be built compared 
with 475000 announced a few weeks ago 
in the case of ford it is losing some sales because of a lack 
of certain models especially the probe and the continental said 
david healy of drexel burham lambert in new york thats an up 
side but theres not very much good about this 
gm has begun trimming some first quarter production schedules 
healy said 
whether the incentives will take the form of cash interest rate 
discounts or other more exotic lures is a closely guarded industry 
secret 
theyve got a bookshelf full of these programs guys whose only 
job it is to dream up new programs healy said what theyll 
basically do is what has worked best in the past for specific 
models 
the prime interest rate rose by half a percentage point monday to 
105 percent at major new york banks the prime rate is what banks 
charge their best customers to borrow money and the new rate means 
consumers will pay more to finance a new car 
if a dealer offers a guy an 800 rebate on a new car and he 
goes to the bank and finds out the interest rate is 13 percent the 
buyer may walk away phillippi said it might be smarter to say 
the car costs this much well give it to you at 79 percent 
interest

the pillsbury co found no takers among 15 
third parties it asked to buy the company on friendly terms after 
grand metropolitan plc launched its takeover bid an attorney for 
pillsbury shareholders says 
they have surveyed the world and they havent come up with 
anything better than what grand met is offering attorney karl 
cambronne said monday 
the game is over they need to redeem their poison pill or 
negotiate with grand met he said 
cambronne said the failed attempt to find a friendly suitor is 
confirmed in a securities and exchange commission filing in which 
pillsbury says it has abandoned the search 
he commented after a hennepin county district court hearing at 
which judge thomas carey took under advisement renewed arguments 
from the shareholders group on its request to have the poison pill 
invalidated force pillsbury to negotiate with grand met and block 
the planned spinoff 
pillsbury asked carey to force grand met to put its best offer on 
the table so pillsbury can accept or reject it cambronne said 
grand met meanwhile on monday extended for the fifth time its 
60 a share allcash tender offer for pillsbury stock 
the tender offer now will expire at midnight est friday unless 
extended again by saturday 853 percent of pillsburys outstanding 
shares had been tendered and not withdrawn grand met said 
the liquor gambling and specialty products conglomerate launched 
its 523 billion hostile takeover bid oct 4 pillsburys board of 
directors has rejected it as inadequate and has refused to meet with 
grand met chairman allen sheppard 
pillsburys investment bankers valued the company at 62 to 78 a 
share in midoctober said lowell sachnoff one of the shareholders 
attorneys 
standing in the way of a takeover are pillsburys poison pill 
defense and a plan to spin off its burger king subsidiary into a 
separate company 
grand met and dissident pillsbury shareholders are suing the food 
and restaurant company to invalidate the poison pill and prevent the 
spinoff 
burger king chairman jerry levin will be questioned thursday for 
five hours in miami by attorneys for the shareholders and grand met 
as part of the litigation carey said 
hopefully well find out more about the burger king plan 
said john cochrane an attorney for the shareholders 
grand met has said a separate burger king would create a huge tax 
liability for grand met if the takeover is successful in addition 
burger king franchisees have announced opposition to the plan 
saying it would add too much debt to the already troubled fastfood 
chain 
the poison pill or shareholders rights plan would make the 
acquisition prohibitively expensive and the tender offer is 
conditioned on its removal grand met has said

two engineering firms that designed two 
abandoned washington public power supply system nuclear power plants 
have agreed to a 25 million cash settlement to get themselves out 
of the wppss securities fraud trial 
junius hoffman a courtappointed settlement master in the case 
announced the settlement monday as the trial resumed in us 
district court here 
united engineers amp constructors inc and ebasco services inc 
agreed to pay 148 million and 72 million respectively to 
former wppss bondbuyers who bought into wppss proposal in the late 
1970s to build two nuclear power plants in western washington 
new yorkbased ebasco also will pay up to 3 million in cash if 
the plaintiffs recover less than that in disputed claims against 
ebascos insurance carriers in addition ebasco agreed to surrender 
part of at least 50 million in disputed insurance claims that the 
company may recover 
a class of 24000 plaintiffs sued more than 100 original 
defendants after wppss defaulted in 1983 on 225 billion in 
municipal bonds sold to build the plants the plaintiffs claim 
wppss 88 public utility districts and others conspired to lie and 
hide information that might have discouraged investors 
judge william browning signed an order severing united engineers 
and ebasco from the suit leaving blyth eastman paine webber inc 
the securities firm that acted as financial adviser to wppss as the 
only remaining defendant in the case 
including the latest settlement the original defendants have 
agreed to pay about 675 million plus funds recovered from insurance 
claims 
browning still must approve the settlements he has not yet 
scheduled hearings on approval testimony 
plaintiff attorney mel weiss called the settlement a fair 
compromise of our claims he said he was taking into account the 
previous settlements and the desire to get money to our clients as 
quickly as possible 
weiss said he no longer was talking with blyth eastman attorneys 
about settlement possibilities 
after the jury was reseated for the first time in more than a 
week he instructed members to attach no significance to settlement 
talk 
as he had done when two earlier settlements were announced he 
did not tell the jury the provisions of the agreement between the 
engineering firms and the plaintiff 
testimony resumed with wppss employee harlan hank kosmatas 
24th trial day on the witness stand 
plaintiff attorney paul bernstein asked kosmata why several 
issues were not included in bondsale documents called official 
statements which were given to potential bond investors 
kosmata the liaison with the utilities in the project rejected 
bernsteins suggestions that concerns about how construction budgets 
were compiled might have been of interest to potential investors 
he said the important issue was that the budgets were approved 
not that preliminary concerns about them were expressed 
kosmata also reaffirmed earlier testimony that he heard no one 
suggest presenting test litigation in court to see if the utilities 
had authority to commit themselves to the project 
that authority was lacking the washington state supreme court 
ruled in 1983 and the agreements to pay off the bonds could not be 
enforced that ruling led to the bond default 
bernstein introduced a 1983 affidavit of peter b wilson an 
attorney for bonners ferry idaho municipal utility saying the 
issue of test litigation regarding the authority was discussed at a 
may 1975 meeting before the utilities agreed to the project 
kosmata said he attended that meeting and heard no discussions 
about a test case 
i came away with a firm feeling there was no problem he said

eaglepicher industries has lost its bid to 
force the federal government to assume some of the liability for 
suits over asbestos pipe material the company manufactured for us 
navy ships 
the us supreme court on monday refused to hear eaglepichers 
challenge to a decision by a federal appeals court in philadelphia 
that the government enjoyed sovereign immunity and thus was immune 
to lawsuits for negligence from use of asbestos products 
obviously were disappointed but it will in no way affect our 
other pending lawsuits against the government said j rodman 
nall an eaglepicher representative 
eaglepicher which has been inundated with damage claims from 
people who say they suffer from cancer and asbestosis because of 
their exposure to asbestos in the companys pipe compound has 
similar negligence suits pendiing against the us government in 
federal courts in seattle and washington dc 
we think as conflicts develop between the courts the supreme 
court will hear one of these cases nall said 
during the military buildup that followed world war ii 
eaglepicher was enlisted by the government to make a pipe joint 
compound containing asbestos for use in shipbuilding 
asbestos was found to be linked to a number of respiratory 
ailments and eagle picher quit making the asbestosladen compound in 
the early 1970s claims filed against the company by shipyard 
workers and their families seek damages totaling in the millions of 
dollars 
eaglepicher contends the federal government should bear some 
responsibility for the asbestosrelated claims because it mandated 
the use of the product and routinely violated its own occupational 
safety and health rules 
the navy insisted on the use of asbestos insulation aboard 
ships it alone knew the extent of the danger and told no one the 
company wrote in a position paper supporting its arguments 
companies enlisted in the war effort were told precisely the 
formula for the insulation and how much asbestos fiber it had to 
contain the problem was created by the navy itself for it set 
the rules for handling the material and then broke them without 
notice or warning the company said 
while challenging the government position in court eaglepicher 
is also trying to get congress to pass laws making the government 
liable 
the company got legislation introduced in the last session of 
congress that would override the doctrine of sovereign immunity and 
make the government accountable for actions and decisions just as 
other employers who control working conditions that affect workers 
health are 
the legislation was introduced in the house of representatives by 
willis gradison a republican and thomas luken a democrat both of 
cincinnati the measure had 70 cosponsors

prime computer inc announced today that its 
board of directors has unanimously rejected a 20pershare buyout 
bid by mai basic four inc 
a release by the computer company called the offer by choice 
corp a wholly owned subsidiary of mai inadequate and not in the 
best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the board recommended that prime stockholders reject the offer 
and not tender their shares in response to the mai offer 
prime chairman david dunn said the board considered several 
factors including primes business and financial condition its 
future prospects recommendations from the companys financial 
advisers and the recent value of its stock 
prime computer stock opened on the new york stock exchange this 
morning at 15 per share 
board members also noted that primes next annual meeting 
scheduled for may 12 1989 comes before the expiration of mais 
offer according to the prime directors the current market price of 
prime common stock reflects the negative effects of the costs and 
expenses associated with the acquisition of computervision 
on the other hand the company expects belttightening measures 
in certain areas to improve nearterm and longterm operating 
results of the company and increase values for stockholders 
we believe the unsolicited 20 offer by choice fails to 
recognize either the intrinsic value of the company today or the 
longterm values achievable by the company for all its 
stockholders 
financier bennett lebow heads mai which is a much smaller 
computer business than prime prime is second to international 
business machines corp in the field of computeraided design and 
manufacturing systems prime acquired computervision in february for 
435 million 
there has been some speculation that lebow undertook the takeover 
attempt to induce prime to buy his company instead in what is 
commonly called a pac man defense of acquiring the suitor 
mai basic a small concern based in tustin calif owns 41 
percent of primes 485 million shares outstanding and is offering 
20 a share for the rest in a tender offer to the shareholders the 
offer valued at 970 million was made nov 15

fujitsu ltd will pay international business 
machines corp hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of 
information about the software that runs ibm mainframe computers 
arbitrators announced today 
the arbitrators decision ends years of dispute between ibm the 
worlds largest computer company and fujitsu japans biggest 
computer maker over precious information about the internal 
workings of ibms mainframe computers 
fujitsu will pay ibm a total 237 million and tens of millions of 
dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan 
devised by the arbitration team 
todays announcement is the biggest development in the 
ibmfujitsu controversy since september 1987 when arbitrators 
announced the initial resolution of ibms charges that fujitsu 
illegally copied ibm software 
ibms stock price which had jumped 287 a share on monday in 
expectations of a big payment from fujitsu edged back 62 cents to 
11825 a share by late morning today 
the american arbitration association had been holding secret 
hearings since then to work out the ground rules under which ibm 
must grant fujitsu access to information about the software that 
runs ibm mainframe computers 
the rules set by the two arbitrators will make it possible for 
fujitsu to develop complex expensive software that controls the 
basic operations of ibm mainframe computers 
ibm which dominates the world market for mainframe computers is 
the only company making the socalled operating system software for 
its own machines 
the information supplied by ibm also will make it easier for 
fujitsu to develop its own line of mainframe computers that compete 
with ibms by running the same programs fujitsu and hitachi ltd 
are ibms two main competitors in that market hitachi is not 
covered by the terms of the ibmfujitsu deal 
ibm and fujitsu issued brief statement today saying they were 
satisfied with the results of the arbitration 
ibm first accused fujitsu in 1982 of illegally copying its 
mainframe software the companies reached a private settlement in 
1983 but the vaguely worded agreement fell apart and ibm in 1985 
asked to have the dispute settled by binding arbitration 
ibm and fujitsu have agreed to let the arbitrators supervise all 
disputes growing out of the case until the year 2002 
the arbitrators are robert h mnookin a stanford university law 
professor and john l jones a computer expert who is a retired 
executive vice president of norfolk southern corp 
details of their 237 millionplus payout plan include fujitsu 
providing ibm 396 million for a paidup license on use of ibm 
programs covered under the 1983 agreement of which fujitsu already 
has paid 125 million 
the arbitrators said fujitsu also was entitled to a refund of 34 
million out of the 471 million it had paid ibm under the 1983 
agreement fujitsu had made an intial payment of 65 million and 
semiannual payments of 406 million that ended last year 
in addition fujitsu will pay ibm between 26 million and 51 
million in 1989 for the right to examine information about ibm 
mainframe software the amount depends on how much material fujitsu 
uses for years after 1989 the arbitrators will decide how much 
fujitsu must pay ibm

grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade after opening 
slightly lower 
the wheat market got a bit of a boost on prospects for a pickup 
in export sales and in response to an agriculture department report 
indicating an increase in export shipments last week analysts said 
corn was up slightly on buying by traders who had sold borrowed 
contracts earlier and soybeans were little changed 
analysts said the opening selloff like the previous days sharp 
decline seemed tied to disappointment that the ussoviet grain 
deal signed monday was only a 27month extension of a 5year pact 
that expired on sept 30 
i think were getting in all these markets some general 
disappointment that the grain agreement really didnt have anything 
new to offer from the old agreement said walter spilka an 
analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 419 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents higher with december at 258 a bushel oats were 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 202 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with january at 749 a bushel

mercantile exchange while pork futures were mostly higher 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 13 cent higher with december 
at 7340 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 20 
cent higher with january at 8255 cents a pound live hogs were 02 
cent lower to 45 cent higher with december at 40 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 20 cent to 48 cent higher with february

rjr nabisco inc stockholders are facing another 
moment of reckoning either to sell their shares and make a windfall 
profit or to sit tight for the next unpredictable chapter in 
historys biggest corporate takeover battle 
a companyimposed deadline for a second round of 
multibilliondollar bids to buy the food and tobacco conglomerate 
was scheduled to expire at 5 pm today and no decisions were 
expected before wednesday 
speculation that new fatter offers would emerge pushed rjr 
nabiscos stock price up 1 a share monday to 89 more than 50 
percent above its value before the takeover saga began two months 
ago the stock rose another 87 cents by late this morning in heavy 
trading 
at least two of the three known bidders an rjr nabisco 
management group and the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts 
co were working on revised proposals according to people 
familiar with the bidding process 
there was no indication monday whether the third contender a 
group led by the investment firm first boston corp planned to 
alter its bid which in the first round was considered the riskiest 
but potentially the richest 
a special committee of rjr nabiscos outside directors 
conducting the auction for the nations 19th largest industrial 
company declined comment on whether any additional bidders had 
emerged 
but officials of atlantabased rjr nabisco had said previously 
that the structure for evaluating all offers would remain unchanged 
from the first round which took place nov 1820 
in that process proposals were submitted in secret to a new york 
law firm representing the special committee followed by a analysis 
of what they were worth and an announcement of the committees 
intentions 
the outside directors extended the auction after the first round 
ended reflecting their view that those proposals were inadequate in 
substance and price 
rjr nabiscos management offered 100 a share in cash and 
securities for a total of about 227 billion kohlberg kravis 
offered 94 a share in cash and securities or 213 billion first 
boston said it might offer 105 to 118 a share in cash and 
securities or 238 billion to 268 billion 
wall street strategists speaking on condition they not be 
identified said there was a widespread presumption that the rjr 
nabisco management group and kohlberg kravis would have to raise 
their previous offers to at least match the potential worth of the 
first boston proposal 
of the three bidders the most uncertainty surrounded first 
boston which in its original offer proposed using a tax loophole 
that expires at the end of this year to raise the value of its offer 
above the others 
under the original plan the first boston group would buy rjr 
nabiscos tobacco business with a socalled installment note which 
would not be subject to a capital gains tax for a number of years 
thereby giving the firm additional money to pay shareholders a 
fatter price 
but that part of the transaction would have to be completed by 
dec 31 because congress closed the loophole on this capitalgains 
deferment leaving many tax experts skeptical about whether first 
bostons offer was realistic 
the struggle for rjr nabisco began in late october when the 
management group led by its chairman f ross johnson said it was 
considering a debtfinanced acquisition of the company maker of 
hundreds of products ranging from salem cigarettes to del monte 
canned fruits 
the amount and heavy use of borrowed money in the takeover plans 
so far have dwarfed all records and incited critical scrutiny of 
such debtfinanced deals in recent years such deals have enriched 
many investors but raised questions about the economic impact of the 
additional debt load on the companies

spending time at the mall has been raised 
to an art form by some high school students but at youngstown state 
university its a management science 
the school has just produced its first two graduates in shopping 
center management and the trainees are finding a bull market for 
their specialized skills 
it was kind of my destiny that i showed up and they had the 
major said tracey farley a former administrative assistant to a 
virginia shopping mall manager and one of the first to earn a mall 
degree 
ever since i started at the mall in virginia beach i knew 
shopping malls were never going to die said ms farley 24 who 
worked 2 years for mall developer melvin simon amp associates 
the study of malls and how to run them leads to a bachelor of 
science degree in business administration at youngstown 
before the university started the program shopping center 
management was mostly taught in seminars offered to established 
shopping mall developers by the international council of shopping 
centers said don pendley spokesman for the group 
this is a major move by a school there arent many 
institutions that talk about shopping malls at all said pendley 
the industry has had three years of record growth with 21 
regional malls of at least 400000 square feet each the size of 10 
football fields built last year pendley said he said that 
overall construction began on 1846 new shopping centers last year 
pendley said the council is helping develop training programs for 
graduate students at harvard university and the university of 
pennsylvania 
theyre looking for somebody to professionalize the development 
and management of centers in this case he said 
youngstown states involvement in training shopping mall managers 
began in 1985 when developers offered to help train managers for the 
growing field said e terry diederick a business professor who 
directs the shopping center major 
theyve been very supportive and theyve been a major source of 
expertise theyve served as lecturers and have been very helpful in 
placing our students he said 
among those offering to help train the students were the locally 
based edward j debartolo corp and the cafaro corp two of the 
countrys largest shopping center developers 
the major which has attracted 25 students this year requires 
business school students to take courses in the history and planning 
of retail sales shopping center operations and problems surrounding 
development diederick said 
he said students are also required to work at internships with 
developers 
we draw on property management concepts that arent really 
talked about in other courses said diederick in describing what 
sets the course apart from other business programs 
a mall is much like a city and they the students have to 
have a lot of those skills said the professor 
among the topics students explore are police science engineering 
and traffic control diederick said 
the shopping center industry has grown dramatically and it has 
gotten to the point that education has to be specific to that 
industry said john richley director of operations for cafaro 
about 55 percent of all retail dollars spent in the united states 
last year went to stores in shopping malls pendley said he said 
that with that figure growing at half a percent a year the council 
projects sharply increased demand from shopping center owners for 
trained managers 
ms farley for instance said she is weighing job offers from 
melvin simon debartolo and cafaro as well as several other 
shopping center developers and she said that until other business 
schools start to copy youngstown states program she doesnt expect 
much competition for the jobs she wants 
right now during this period there is no way you can get a view 
of what the industry is about in any other classroom setting she 
said

the problems of attorney dan dooley who 
farms a small parcel east of here show how difficult its getting 
to balance the interests of agriculture and development in 
california 
residents in the area complain about dust noise bugs and 
traffic congestion caused by slowmoving tractors while farmers 
suffer from vandalism to farm and irrigation equipment and trash 
from weekend picnickers 
repeated complaints by neighbors finally forced dooley to change 
his cropping patterns 
we just dont grow cotton on our ranch anymore the conflicts 
are just too severe he said 
rapid growth in the fertile san joaquin valley locked between 
san francisco and los angeles may eventually ruin farming in what 
is regarded as the worlds richest agricultural region 
a department of agriculture study shows as many as 50000 acres 
of productive crop land in the state are paved over or removed from 
production each year because of urbanization 
air pollution primarily brought on by heavy vehicle traffic is 
making serious cuts in production of some crops such as grapes 
according to fresno county supervisor vernon conrad a panelist at a 
recent discussion here sponsored by the california rural development 
committee 
we can preserve the land but if we cant preserve the 
production what good is it conrad said of the air pollution 
issue if we dont do some planning and take care of some of the 
obvious shortfalls its going to be too late 
about 815000 acres of farm land will be lost in california 
between now and the year 2000 estimated john c williamson a 
former assemblyman who sponsored the states strong farmland 
conservation measures in the early 1960s 
all efforts now being made are inadequate for the purpose of 
protecting farm land williamson said 
will shafroth director of the american farmland trust agreed 
that current preservation efforts are inadequate but said public 
officials have a number of tools available to spare crop lands from 
a layer of fresh asphalt 
shafroth called for strict landuse regulations to prevent 
leapfrog development or housing subdivisions and industrial 
parks situated in the middle of productive fields such development 
in north natomas area of sacramento county has led to the demise of 
onceproductive rice farms 
eugene smith planning and development director for tulare 
county said planners must regard agriculture as an industry when 
examining housing development proposals 
just as locating a residence in an industrial park leads to 
conflict and does not make sense locating a residence in the middle 
of an agricultural area does not make sense said smith 
rural residential growth right now in the san joaquin valley is 
the greatest threat to preservation of farm land smith said 
the practice of splitting off small parcels of the farm so family 
members can build homes or rural ranchettes is a common way 
development encroaches on agriculture he said 
dooley said his farm cant use certain chemicals because of the 
nearby homes and the materials he does use can only be applied by 
ground spray rigs not by aerial cropdusters 
to keep developers at bay farmers are being encouraged to retain 
their land when inflated prices make selling out a lucrative option 
the sale of development rights to public agencies is another option 
under such agreements a public agency pays a farm owner the 
difference between the farm lands current and potential value for 
housing or other urban uses when development rights are conveyed 
future development is restricted in the property deed but the 
farmer retains ownership of the land 
a similar concept is used to acquire land in the lake tahoe basin 
to stop excessive development and improve environmental quality 
while financing such a program is unclear officials have 
suggested such options as bond issues taxes on sales of converted 
farm land or local taxing districts

honeywell inc said tuesday it plans to sell 
its semiconductor operation in colorado springs colo 
the colorado springs unit manufactures custom and semicustom 
integrated circuits for the computer merchant market as well as for 
honeywells internal needs and select military customers 
the decision to sell the colorado springs operation is 
consistent with our desire to concentrate on our core businesses 
said james j renier honeywell president and chief executive 
officer 
with the divestiture of the computer business at the end of 
1986 and actions since then to focus on our leadership position in 
controls we no longer need such an extensive facility for circuits 
used internally nor is it in our strategic interest to be in the 
merchant chip business renier added 
except for highly proprietary circuits most of our 
semiconductor needs can be satisfied on the outside he said 
the colorado springs operation is part of the companys solid 
state electronics division which also includes a research and 
development facility in plymouth honeywell had previously said it 
intended to restructure the division to fit the companys strategic 
direction 
honeywell said it would maintain the plymouth facility as a 
modest captive operation it will transfer a limited number of 
fabrication technologies and products from colorado springs to 
plymouth to aid in meeting future internal and military customer 
requirements for proprietary integrated circuits 
the company is seeking a buyer who will also continue to support 
external customers and also honeywells internal requirements during 
a transition period 
about 1100 employees work in the fourbuilding colorado springs 
complex and honeywell said it expects employees to transfer to the 
new owner at the time of sale

futures prices of wheat corn and soybeans closed 
mostly higher tuesday on the chicago board of trade in a late flurry 
of buying by traders who had sold contracts earlier in the session 
analysts attributed the closing rally almost entirely to 
shortcovering a form of profittaking that amounts to selling 
high then buying low instead of buying low then selling high 
the last 10 minutes just turned into a very good rally on 
shortcovering said jon horton a research analyst with research 
department inc a chicagobased analytical firm they just ran 
out of selling there toward the close and everyone started to 
cover 
oat futures plunged for the second day in a row in a continuing 
reaction to abundant supplies of feedquality oats said jay homan 
an independent trader 
homan also said the oat market was shrinking away from the 
inflated prices caused by droughtrelated panic buying during the 
summer 
at the close of trading wheat was 1 cents to 5 cents higher

new construction contracts rose slightly in 
october after a threemonth slump on the strength of residential 
building everywhere except in the northeast a businessresearch 
company reported tuesday 
the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information services co said 
that new construction projects last month were up 1 percent to an 
annualized value of 2402 billion construction contracts fell 3 
percent in september following drops in the previous two months 
george a christie a mcgrawhill economist said that while the 
october improvement was welcome it should be interpreted as a 
pause rather than a turnaround for the sagging construction sector 
the prospect of a postelection rise of interest rates presents 
the risk of a further setback for this creditsensitive industry 
christie said housing which provided most of octobers support 
is especially vulnerable 
housing starts were up by about 7 percent in october with the 
value of contracts for one and multifamily houses rising 4 percent 
to an annualized 1208 billion the report said 
the report said that all regions shared in the improved housing 
activity but the northeast which experienced a 10 percent decline 
from septembers rate of contracting 
october contracting for nonresidential buildings fell 8 percent 
to an annualized 756 billion the report said it said the biggest 
declines were in office buildings down 23 percent and in schools 
down 22 percent 
for the first 10 months new construction starts on an unadjusted 
basis totaled 2134 billion down 3 percent from the same period in 
1987 the report said the south with a shortfall of 6 percent 
remained the nations weakest building market in 1988 while the

billions of dollars in potential shareholder 
profits from two staggering takeover deals have aroused a debate 
over how the money will be reinvested with some strategists saying 
the outcome could determine the future direction of stocks and the 
economy 
in one of the biggest takeovers ever philip morris cos will buy 
kraft inc for 126 billion or 106 a share for owners of kraft 
shares prior to the takeover plan first disclosed last month when 
the stock traded at about 60 that represents a profit of more 
than 76 percent 
an even bigger deal looms for rjr nabisco inc which has been 
the target of competing bids valued at between 213 billion to 
268 billion or 94 a share to 118 as share 
for holders of rjr shares which traded at about 56 in 
midoctober that means a potential maximum profit of nearly 111 
percent 
if a significant part of the money from the megadeals is plowed 
back into the stock market it would be considered a strong sign of 
confidence that the country is growing and recession is unlikely for 
a while 
on the other hand if most of the money goes into 
interestbearing accounts or government bonds it will reinforce 
fears that stocks will head lower and an economic downturn isnt far 
off 
my opinion is the stock market is in a major peak said 
charles m laloggia author of special situation report a widely 
followed market newsletter based in rochester ny 
my advice to anybody lucky enough to own stock in a takeover 
target taken out in a peak is to put it to work in a treasury 
bill laloggia said 
a few optimists have predicted that because of the sheer volume 
of this money some will find its way into the stock market and 
could serve as the octane to drive up prices perhaps snapping wall 
street out of its slump 
but the prevailing view appears to be that most shareholders 
the majority of them large institutional investors likely will 
park their profits in safe shortterm government treasury bonds 
the 83 percent yield of a threemonth treasury bill represents a 
better investment than components of the standard amp poors 500stock 
index a widely watched barometer of the general stock markets 
health which has risen about 87 percent the entire year 
with interest rates moving up and threemonth treasuries 
yielding more than 8 percent its hard to justify giving up that 
safety for the risk of the stock market said david blitzer chief 
economist for standard amp poors corp 
that suggests to me that whoever owns shares in whatever 
celebrated buyout is going on if he listens to most investment 
advisers he wont put it back into the stock market blitzer 
said hell wait for a sunnier day 
countering this view is the theory that while demand for stocks 
continues the number of stocks is shrinking partly because of 
takeovers and mergers such as the kraft and rjr nabisco deals 
according to federal reserve figures the amount of available stock 
has shrunk by about 75 billion in each of the past two years 
if thats true some strategists say simple laws of supply and 
demand will dictate that stock prices rise making them more 
attractive and drawing more investors including those who made 
windfall profits in the two big takeovers 
i would assume part of that money would be going into the stock 
market said rao chalasani a market strategist at the 
clevelandbased firm prescott ball amp turben inc 
i think there are other stocks priced similarly to those two 
companies prior to when the takeovers were announced he said 
some of the money would go into these companies regardless of 
whether they will be taken over 
others say the supplydemand theory is a fiction promoted by the 
securities industry when its clear the stock market has hit a 
cyclical high 
i regard all the work ive seen that says theres a 
supplydemand situation to be nonsense said james cramer owner 
of cramer amp co a new york money management firm 
the main reason is you can buy all the ge you want you can 
buy all the ibm you want and the prices arent rising he said 
there are too many stocks that nobody wants and too few that 
everybody wants

president reagan in his final budget will 
make one last effort to overhaul the way congress parcels out money 
including recommending a switch from 1year to 2year spending 
plans administration sources said tuesday 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the president 
will submit a laundry list of recommended changes in the way the 
appropriations process works 
many of these proposals are ones that reagan has sought 
repeatedly during his white house tenure such as presidential 
authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills and a 
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget 
while reagan will leave office without getting any of his pet 
reforms adopted advisers to presidentelect george bush have 
indicated that bush will pursue the fight for at least some of the 
changes 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who will stay on in the bush 
administration has been particularly supportive of the 2year 
budget cycle 
the planning for the federal government is so hectic that if we 
can get it on a 2year basis we would greatly improve the process 
and i think that many in congress feel the same way brady has 
said 
currently congress must review agencies requests for funds each 
year and pass a spending plan for the budget year which begins oct 
1 the deliberations consume hundreds of hours for lawmakers who 
often miss the start of the fiscal year and are forced to pass a 
stopgap spending measure to keep the government from shutting down 
in his state of the union address last january reagan called for 
a switch to a 2year budget cycle proposing that congress try the 
approach on a trial basis covering defense spending for two years 
the effort was shortcircuited however when congress and the 
administration were forced to enter budget summit negotiations late 
last year following the collapse of the stock market 
reagan has encountered stiff opposition in the past to his ideas 
for budget reform primarily because many of them involve shifting 
power from congress to the president 
but some officials suggested that with a new administration and 
the urgent need to deal with the budget deficit it was possible 
that reforming the budget process would gain momentum 
many are looking to the national economic commission a 
highlevel advisory panel on the deficit to take the lead in 
recommending ways to streamline the budget process 
several members of the commission including former defense 
secretary caspar weinberger have said they believe reforming the 
process should be a top priority in any deficitreduction plan 
according to sources these are the proposals the president is 
expected to make on jan 9 when he sends his final budget to 
congress 
2year budget cycle reagan has said that a 2year budget would 
eliminate repetitive annual budget tasks give congress more time 
for oversight functions and eliminate budgetary gimmicks such as 
shifting spending from one year into the next to make the deficit 
appear smaller 
line item veto the president has repeatedly sought the same 
power that 43 governors have to veto individual items in a 
spending bill without having to reject the entire bill the veto 
could be overridden by a twothirds vote in both houses 
balanced budget amendment another reagan perennial this 
constitutional amendment would require revenues and spending to be 
in balance similar to requirements in effect in many states along 
with this the president also supports a constitutional amendment to 
require a greaterthanmajority vote whenever congress raises taxes 
joint resolution currently congress passes a joint resolution 
early in the budget process that provides the broad outlines for 
spending and taxes but this proposal is not subject to presidential 
review reagan wants a change to require the presidents signature 
on the resolution as a way of involving the executive branch in the 
process 
presidential cuts the president under current law must ask 
congress for permission if he decides not to spend money the 
lawmakers appropriate the request known as a rescission 
however can simply be ignored by congress forcing the president to 
go ahead and spend the money reagan wants to require congress to go 
on record with an upordown vote each time a president asks for 
authority not to spend money 
individual spending bills congress is supposed to appropriate 
money through 13 separate spending bills but occasionally ends up 
passing a catchall bill with up to twothirds of the governments 
spending crammed into one massive document for the first time since 
1976 congress was able to get all 13 spending bills passed this 
year reagan would like stiffer rules to make congress live up to 
this requirement

the value of us farm exports should increase 
slightly to 365 billion this year but the volume of sales will 
fall about 8 percent lagely because of last summers drought the 
agriculture department reported tuesday 
export values are predicted to grow by 1 billion in fiscal 1989 
while volume will drop to 136 million metric tons down from a 
sixyear high of 1475 million metric tons in the year ended sept 
30 according to richard w goldberg acting undersecretary of 
agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs 
goldberg delivered what he described as a bright agricultural 
trade forecast at the opening session of usdas agricultural outlook 
conference an annual event in which government analysts outline 
prospects for the coming year for farmers and agribusiness 
export volume is forecast smaller as the us share of world 
trade shrinks for droughtaffected products goldberg said 
overall the united states is expected to account for 48 percent 
of world total grain trade in 1989 down from 50 percent one of the 
hardest hit commodities is soybeans with the us share of world 
soybean trade forecast to drop to 35 percent in 1989 from 49 percent 
although the us share of world wheat trade is expected to show 
a small gain in 1989 the volume of american wheat and flour exports 
is forecast to fall by about 3 percent while corn exports should 
grow by 2 percent said james r donald chairman of the world 
agricultural outlook board 
in general farm prices are rising because of lower global grain 
stocks mostly from the drought in north america and goldberg said 
world prices for wheat corn and soybeans should be their highest 
since 1985 
goldberg said a 26 billion increase in the value of us grain 
and feed exports will offset declines for cotton and oilseeds in 
1989 
for us agriculture the challenge in the coming year will be 
to sustain the momentum in overseas sales which has been regained 
over the past few years goldberg said this will require more 
competitive prices aggressive market development persistent trade 
policy efforts and a marketoriented trade philosophy 
donald reported that us farmers probably will receive less cash 
income but higher net income next year in the aftermath of the 
summer drought consumers are expected to pay 3 percent to 5 percent 
more for food in 1989 compared with about a 4 percent increase this 
year 
smaller crop supplies firm demand and higher prices are shaping 
the global agricultural outlook for 1989 according to donald 
expanded output appears likely in the second half of 1989 and he 
said continued large supplies of animal products probably will 
dampen livestock price increases 
still american farmers can expect slightly higher receipts when 
they market their crops and livestock in 1989 donald said 
but they will be getting less in direct government payments and 
their production expenses will rise with expanded acreage and 
costlier production inputs donald said 
cash income therefore is likely to decline by about 10 percent 
from this years recordtying estimated level of 56 billion to 58 
billion he said 
in contrast donald said net farm income is expected to about 20 
percent above this years estimated level of 38 billion to 40 
billion 
the 1989 outlook favors the food shopper even though the 
drought trimmed potential meat output donald said he said meat 
supplies would be the second largest ever boosted by sizable pork 
supplies and even greater poultry supplies

fujitsu ltd will pay international business 
machines corp 237 million in the next two weeks and millions more 
in coming years in return for secrets about the software that runs 
ibm mainframe computers arbitrators said tuesday 
the arbitrators binding order ends a bitter dispute that began 
in 1982 when ibm accused fujitsu of copying the complex baselayer 
software that runs ibms most powerful computers 
the arbitrators robert h mnookin and john l jones compensated 
ibm for the information it must surrender while removing doubt about 
the legality of compatible software developed by fujitsu 
the arbitrators solomonlike solved a dilemma in that both 
sides get what they want said michael geran an analyst for nikko 
securities co international inc 
both companies issued written statements expressing satisfaction 
with the order but were forbidden by the arbitrators from commenting 
further 
analysts said the amount of money being paid to the worlds 
largest computer company was less important than the affirmation of 
its property rights and the limits on information fujitsu can obtain 
ibm came out ahead on the arbitration what ibm gave up was 
limited and they got back a nice sum of money said steven cohen 
an analyst at soundview financial group in stamford conn 
fujitsu japans biggest computer maker has already paid 471 
million to ibm under a defunct 1983 accord and 125 million as 
partial payment for a paidup license covering future use of 
previously released fujitsu programs some of which contain ibm 
programming material 
in addition to the 237 million that remains to be paid on the 
paidup license fujitsu will make annual payments each year through 
june 25 1997 for use of new ibm programming materialthe 
arbitrators will decide how big the payments will be in 1989 the 
fee will be between 26 million and 51 million 
by the end of the century fujitsus overall payments to ibm 
could exceed 1 billion 
ibms stock rose 50 cents a share to 11937 tuesday in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading after rising 287 a 
share monday on anticipation of the announcement the announcement 
was made after the close of tuesdays trading of fujitsu stock in 
tokyo 
the companies reached a private settlement in 1983 but the 
vaguely worded agreement fell apart and ibm in 1985 asked to have 
the dispute settled by binding arbitration 
the american arbitration association gave the case to mnookin a 
stanford university law professor and jones a retired computer 
expert from norfolk southern corp the men announced a preliminary 
agreement in september 1987 
in addition to specifying payments the arbitrators new order 
spells out the ground rules under which fujitsu engineers may 
examine ibm software in a secure location that will be set up in 
japan 
fujitsu makes computers and baselayer software that are intended 
to run the same programs as the mainframe computers made by ibm 
however slight discrepancies in the two companies baselayer 
software known as the operating system mean that fujitsus 
computers have not been entirely compatible with ibms 
the arbitrators order will give fujitsu enough information so 
that fujitsu computers and base software should be able to run all 
ibm mainframe software without modification 
but fujitsu will still have to do its own programming 
fujitsu cant just take a reel of tape from ibm copy it and 
send it out to all their customers cohen said 
the arbitrators decided fujitsu deserved the inside information 
from ibm out of fairness to fujitsu customers and to the company 
itself which began copying ibms base software at a time when its 
legal property status was unclear 
fujitsus mainframe computers are sold mainly in japan and in 
europe where some are marketed by siemens ag 
japans hitachi ltd and amdahl corp a us company that is 
partly owned by fujitsu also compete in the market for 
ibmcompatible mainframes but they do not produce their own base 
software customers of those companies buy their operating system 
software from ibm 
frank gens an analyst at international data corp predicted 
that ibm and fujitsu would continue to do battle before the 
arbitrators on interpretation of the terms of the order 
protracted battles would hurt fujitsu which needs to get 
information as quickly as possible to stay current with ibm the 
arbitrators will have jurisdiction over the companies interactions 
through nov 29 2002

revision in the thirdquarter us gross national product to 26

entirely for the dollars drop 
the dollars rise which picked up momentum in the early 
afternoon in new york appeared to be unrelated to any economic 
news traders said 
some big banks may have bid the dollar up in an effort to put a 
squeeze on shorts that is traders who had borrowed dollars in 
hopes that the currency would decline and they would be able to make 
a profit by paying back the lenders with cheaper dollars said james

an investor group pursuing tw services inc said 
tuesday its tender offer for some of tw services shares attracted 
about twice as many shares as sought and that it was extending its 
29ashare offer to all of the food services companys stock 
the group coniston partners said its amended offer of 114 
billion in cash for the 81 percent of tw services that it does not 
already own would expire at 1201 am on dec 13 
coniston also said it had asked the delaware chancery court to 
require the tw services board to redeem or invalidate the 
poisonpill rights that would otherwise make its bid for control of 
the company prohibitively expensive 
in response tw services said its board would consider conistons 
amended offer in due course 
its chairman and chief executive frank l salizzoni said the 
substantial number of shares tendered was irrelevant because the 
partial tender was designed from the outset to stampede 
shareholders into tendering their stock in hopes of forcing the 
company into another transaction 
he said the amended coniston offer for all tw stock remains 
highly conditional 
given that it is conditioned among other things on tw 
services entering into a satisfactory merger agreement it remains 
merely an invitation to enter merger negotiations he said in a 
statement 
coniston a new yorkbased investment firm that already owns 
about 93 million of tw services 486 million shares launched a 
tender offer for 1575 million of tw services shares in late october 
the combination of those shares with what coniston already owned 
would give it about 51 percent of the company 
coniston said that when its partial tender offer expired at 1201 
am tuesday nearly 302 million shares had been tendered which 
would have given coniston nearly 82 percent of tw services 
outstanding shares 
under its twostep plan coniston said it would then acquire the 
remaining shares in a merger for 29 a share in cash 
coniston said the twostep plan was devised to get around the 
delaware antitakeover law that restricts uninvited bidders from 
building a stake in a company based in that state 
paul e tierney jr a coniston principal said he expects the 
only obstacle that would prevent coniston from buying tendered stock 
after its offer expires next month would be the poison pill 
coniston has said that if it acquires tw services it plans to 
sell the companys health services operations which include 27 
skilled nursing facilities and two retirement living centers 
tw services other operations include 1200 dennys restaurants 
400 hardees fastfood restaurants and canteen corp a food 
services company

general electric co and two employees were 
indicted tuesday on federal charges of hiding 10 million worth of 
savings in a contract to make a battlefield computer system 
ge the nations thirdlargest defense contractor said the 
indictment was unfair and sensationalized adding that the 
company intends to fight the charges 
ge also said an internal investigation showed pricing 
discrepancies totaling 369 million which the company already has 
refunded 
ge faces a maximum penalty of 71871 million plus restitution 
the government said 
we look forward to the opportunity to have a jury judge the 
merits of the case said thomas h lee ii first assistant us 
attorney 
the defense case was not the first involving ge in 1985 the 
company pleaded guilty to unrelated contractfraud charges 
in washington the defense department said no decisions have been 
made as yet on suspension or debarment of ge to bid on defense 
contracts 
the allegations will now have to be reviewed by the army 
said william caldwell a pentagon spokesman 
the 321count indictment charges that ge through its 
whollyowned subsidiary management and technical services co in 
king of prussia pa negotiated subcontracting costs less than 
anticipated and hid the lower prices from the army 
ge was awarded a 250 million contract in june 1983 to make the 
decentralized automated service support system for the army 
the company and the two employees lied to the defense department 
about the prices the company was paying for parts and raw materials 
and doublebilled for some materials according to the indictment 
the government also charges james badolato 41 of springfield 
pa formerly the subcontracts manager for matsco with trying to 
cover up the scheme by altering dates of purchase orders and 
withholding information from government auditors 
the other employee gerald a leo 51 of king of prussia 
formerly the materials manager for matsco was also charged with 
lying to a federal auditor 
in its statement ge denied any criminal wrongdoing and said the 
employees maintained their innocence leo and badolato referred 
reporters to the company attorneys 
the simple fact is that the case against ge revolves around a 
negotiaion in the spring of 1983 in which the two employees at masco 
allegedly failed to notify the army that they had succeeded in 
negotiating lower subcontract prices with several vendors than had 
originally been projected ge said in a written statement 
any legitimate governmental interest could be served by an 
appropriate civil resolution of this matter ge said 
ge is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of 
presenting false claims to the government 
leo was charged with racketeering five counts of mail fraud and 
two counts of making false statements and concealing material facts 
from a federal agency 
badolato was charged with one count of racketeering five counts 
of mail fraud one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one 
count of making false statements and concealing material facts from 
a federal agency 
leo and badolato have since been transferred to other parts of 
ge the government said 
in 1987 ge did 58 billion worth of business with the defense 
department the government said 
if convicted leo faces a maximum of 55 years in jail 1276 
million in fines and forfeiture of salary bonuses and company stock 
derived from the racketeering badolato faces the same penalties 
plus 5000 more in fines if convicted 
nicholas c harbist assistant us attorney said he did not know 
the amount of bonuses the men received 
ge pleaded guilty in may 1985 to contractfraud charges paying a 
104 million fine and rembursing the government 800000 
the company was indicted in march 1985 for forging employee time 
cards and manipulating costs to recover losses on the minuteman 
missles

famous fried chicken to make further disclosures before it may buy 
stock of churchs fried chicken under its 290 million hostile 
buyout offer 
separately churchs board of directors met in new york and 
authorized management to explore alternatives to popeyes 8 a share 
tender offer including a possible transaction with a third party 
san antonio texasbased churchs the nations secondbiggest 
fried chicken chain rejected popeyes offer as inadequate on oct 
25 and again on tuesday 
us district judge charles schwartz issued a preliminary 
injunction barring popeyes from buying churchs stock until 10 
business days after it makes certain disclosures regarding its 
alleged use of nonpublic corporate information 
churchs has contended that its former chief financial officer 
lewis b kilbourne took confidential inside corporate information 
with him when he was hired by new orleansbased popeyes the 
nations no 3 chicken chain 
churchs also contened popeyes financial adviser wasserstein 
perrella amp co relied on that information in formulating the 
takeover bid

buyout offer was made and to stop using at least for now any 
confidential churchs information it might have

the company had spent to buy and maintain an offshore racing boat 
corporate jet helicopter yacht bus and luxury car used by its 
chairman al copeland

disclosures were made 
a churchs spokesman said the company would appeal the judges 
refusal to grant a permanent injunction against the takeover and a 
preliminary injunction on the antitrust claims 
peter butler popeyes new orleans lawyer said schwartz would 
have all the information this week he said he could not comment on 
the claim that popeyes offer was based on insider information 
regarding the corporate expenditures for boats planes and other

legitimate business expenses by the business firm retained by mr 
copeland and been reviewed very carefully
