voters in this denver suburb on 
tuesday recalled their mayor and four city council members in a flap 
that began when a tv crew filmed the police and fire chiefs drinking 
on the job 
the mayor condoned the activity said recall organizer verna 
cook as far as the council is concerned i certainly think that 
their inaction has caused his to happen and they should be 
recalled 
voters cast 801 ballots to recall mayor lester bauer 81 and 361 
to retain him said city clerk peggy french mark stickel was 
elected his successor with 433 votes 
four of the councils six members were recalled mildred early 
bob hamilton grace diamond and mayor pro tem ernest shelton french 
said they were replaced by richard wright robert snell linda dunn 
and al pfluger council incumbents wayne martin and early headly 
held onto their seats 
cook herself ran for mayor to unseat bauer who in november 
survived another recall vote she spearheaded over skunk removal 
tuesdays recall election stemmed from a series of reports on 
denvers kusatv in april in which police chief dwain farris and 
fire chief jim fyffe were filmed drinking at bars while on duty on 
several afternoons 
the city council initially asked for farris resignation and 
suspended fyffe for 30 days without pay but an angry crowd at a 
city council meeting the next night persuaded the council to fire 
both men 
cook said that the council knew about the mens alleged drinking 
problems before the televised reports but did nothing about them 
she then organized the recall drive against bauer and the four 
council members ousted tuesday 
shelton who was targeted in the recall started a recall effort 
of his own against martin and headly who survived tuesdays 
election 
bauer said of cooks second recall campaign she has that right 
and thats her prerogative thats twice that theyve tried it but 
i think shell have a big job on her hands to recall the entire 
council 
french had said she expected good turnout among the 4500 
registered voters but turnout was light fifteen candidates vied 
for seven seats voters decided first whether to recall the 
incumbents and then who should replace them 
in the recall election in november ballots were counted three 
times before it was determined that bauer had kept his job by one 
vote 896895 
that recall was launched after a resident was cited for shooting 
a skunk bauer opponents rallied around the resident saying the 
city had stopped paying for removal of stray animals

fine art prices are going going gonzo this 
auction season soaring through the ceiling when the gavel comes 
down but even as the art market booms some experts fear the 
picture may not stay so pretty 
a lot of people are being taken in by this sort of fever 
said george goldner a curator and top buyer at the j paul getty 
museum the nations richest the longer it goes on the more it 
resembles a bubble that one day will burst 
for now the inflation is inescapable as even goldner will 
attest he paid 325 million for a 16th century painting last 
month more than tripling the record for an old master at auction 
and all that glitters is not goldners 
records were set for more than three dozen modern postmodern 
and impressionist painters at sales in may including 479 million 
for a picasso selfportrait an 800 percent increase from its 1981 
price only one painting has done better a van gogh that drew 539 
million in 1987 
an 18 century american bookcase desk sold in may for 121 
million quadrupling the record for a piece of furniture the 
reported buyer was neither museum nor gallery but a texas 
financier robert m bass 
a catskill mountains landscape sold for 825 million tops for 
an old american painting a frederic remington bronze brought 44 
million a new height for american sculpture the birds of 
america etchings by john james audubon sold for 396 million an 
increase of 2 million in less than two years 
such prices are reflected in thousands of lesser sales rippling 
through the art world in a delicious shudder at least for sellers 
sothebys auction house the worlds biggest gaveled off 18 
billion in goods last year up by 400 million from 1987 and this 
year is far bigger 
its awesome its mindboggling said milton esterow 
publisher of artnews magazine art has become an international 
currency the market has exploded its a revolution a renaissance 
like weve never seen before 
but the glee is not universal art experts say the soaring sums 
are pricing many museums out of the market leaving them unable to 
expand or upgrade their collections some say auction hype has 
falsely inflated some prices 
its simple and easy buy something and youll get rich this 
is the message of the auction rooms said goldner its the 
wrong message and people eventually are going to get hurt by it 
there will be a day when the market will shake out and bad modern 
paintings wont be worth what people are paying for them today 
the reason for arts price explosion is simple because of 
worldwide economic good times many people have much more money as 
some of that cash migrated to art prices rose drawing finer art 
to the market and raising prices even higher and 1986 federal tax 
changes limited the benefits of donating art to museums putting 
even more works on the market 
additionally said harvey katz an art market analyst for the 
investment firm salomon brothers inc the auction houses have 
improved their marketing techniques catalogs are less intimidating 
major works are sent on tour before sales bidding is simpler and 
telephone bids are accepted 
as the auction houses have become more accessible theyve 
captured more and more business said katz one result christies 
auction house is rumored as a takeover target and sothebys is 
splitting its stock two for one 
but goldner said auction house promotions can misrepresent the 
value of some pieces particularly costly modern art and he called 
sothebys practice of lending money to buyers a dangerous trend that 
inflates the market and increases the perception of art as a 
speculative commodity 
john marion chairman of sothebys north america maintained that 
buyers still are primarily collectors drawn to certain works not 
investors seeking profit and he said marketing ultimately does 
not create sales 
what weapons do we use to get people into bidding they do 
spend real money marion said sothebys willingness to loan 
buyers some of that money he added is no different from a banks 
loan to a home buyer 
another concern is the art booms effect on public museums many 
of which are finding themselves unable to afford major purchases or 
pressed to sell some works to private buyers which removes the art 
from public view 
such was the case for the walker art center in minneapolis a 
modern art gallery that sold the 825 million catskill landscape 
by frederic edwin church to finance purchases of modern works the 
painting was on loan to the minneapolis institute of art which had 
it on display a dealer bought it 
this was an issue we wrestled with long and hard said erwin 
kelena board member of the walker and its acquisitions committee 
chairman is it our responsibility to keep a 19th century painting 
on public view even if not in our institution or to maximize 
acquisitions for our own collection 
while the latter concern prevailed kelen said the painting 
likely will outlive its new owners and be returned to a museum 
goldner however said he feared the growing concept of art as a 
commodity would work against that outcome 
the sad fact is that a lot of people who call themseves 
collectors today are investors he said and instead of giving 
their collections toward the end of their life to a museum to put on 
display they see their apotheosis as being a successful sale at 
sothebys 
marion for his part is looking forward to sothebys greatest 
sale yet an estate auction next fall that includes 44 paintings 
valued at 1 million or more each including a van gogh a picasso 
and nine monets the total take should easily exceed 100 million 
the fall he said looks to be very very strong

ten years after skylab created fear 
and fascination with its fiery plunge from orbit nasa is racing to 
retrieve another giant satellite this one as big as a bus before 
it falls to earth 
the satellite is being pushed by solar pressure and tugged by 
earths gravity toward a predicted crash through the atmosphere in 
january 
experts say as many as 100 onepound chunks of debris could 
survive the blazing reentry and reach the earth with a remote 
possibility of people getting hurt 
not many americans are in danger because the satellite ldef for 
long duration exposure facility passes over only hawaii south 
florida and the southern tip of texas nor are western europeans 
soviets or most chinese threatened 
ldefs path covers all territory between 285 degrees north and 
285 degrees south of the equator mainly water but also most of 
africa south america india southeast asia and australia 
to try to save the satellite and its cargo of experiments nasa 
plans to launch the space shuttle columbia and a crew of five dec 
18 to pull in the errant satellite with the shuttles 60foot robot 
arm stow it in the spacecrafts cargo bay and take it home 
the main reason for retrieving the satellite is not to save 
lives because officials feel the danger is slight rather they 
want the spacecraft back to find out what has happened to it and its 
experiment during nearly six years in space 
the information is of interest to engineers designing nasas 
permanent space station freedom and to scientists of the strategic 
defense intiative who envision a network of orbiting star wars 
missile defense satellites that must endure long exposure to the 
same elements that have battered ldef for years 
everything on it is of extreme interest said william h 
kinard the ldef projects chief scientist at nasas langley 
research center have the strength properties changed do the 
mechanical systems still work what about the hinges motors 
latches lubrications data systems 
we have no communications with the spacecraft we have to get 
it back he said 
if predictions are wrong or if solar flare activity increases in 
the coming months ldef could reenter the atmosphere and break up 
before the shuttle can get there 
it will be close but it looks like well be ok with a december 
launch said kinard 
if ldef does reenter it isnt expected to be the sensation that 
skylab was when it dashed through the atmosphere on july 11 1979 
raining debris into the indian ocean and on remote areas of 
australia 
skylab was much bigger at 775 tons and 118 feet long about 26 
tons survived the fierce reentry heat and thousands of pieces some 
up to two tons hit water and land along a path 3600 miles long and 
100 miles wide no one was hurt and no damage was done 
ldef is 30 feet long and 14 feet in diameter and weighs 107 tons 
skylab which had been home to three astronaut crews during six 
years in orbit received considerable attention because it flew over 
a large area of the globe including most of europe all of the 
continental united states southern canada and much of the soviet 
union and china 
for months before the space lab fell the world received daily 
predictions on when it might come down it was the largest machine 
man had ever put into space and there was great uncertainty over 
just how much would survive and how many injuries or deaths and how 
much damage the debris might cause 
computer calculations gradually narrowed the predicted reentry to 
sometime in july but the exact day was forecast only two days 
before and the exact hour just hours before 
final projections were off by several minutes and nasas 
forecast of an indian ocean landing proved wrong when residents of 
western australia watched flaming debris fall from the sky 
ldef was placed in orbit in april 1984 by the space shuttle 
challenger it was to have been retrieved 10 months later by another 
shuttle crew but delays in the launch schedule and the 1986 
challenger explosion postponed the effort for years 
planners thought they had plenty of time to get the satellite 
with some scientists forecasting it could stay aloft until 1991 but 
increased sunspot activity has caused earths atmosphere to expand 
pushing denser air to higher elevations that has resulted in more 
drag on the satellite slowing it down and pushing it closer to the 
ground where gravity has a stronger tug 
ldef has descended from its original 288milehigh orbital path 
to about 250 miles kinard said the forecast is that by midjanuary 
it will be at about 167 miles the point where it will begin to 
tumble out of control and break up 
the spacecraft carries 57 experiments intended to determine how a 
wide range of materials are affected by constant bombardment from 
micrometeoroids radiation manmade space debris and other items in 
space 
there also are 13 million tomato seeds aboard which are to be 
distributed to students around the country who are to plant them in 
tests for growing food on long space voyages

the 3 billion christian publishing business 
doesnt thrive on the good book alone 
the 350 exhibitors at mondays convention of the christian 
booksellers association offered everything from tshirts and 
videotapes to jigsaw puzzles and computerized bible programs 
one sale item was a baseball cap bearing the message repent 
theyre showing the spiritual warfare between the powers of 
satan and christianity and showing that christ is supreme but 
in novel form said bob hawkins jr vice president for marketing 
for harvest house publishers 
the 3 billion industry has grown by leaps and bounds during the 
last decade said william r anderson president of the association 
what was basically just a momandpop industry only a few years 
ago now is a serious worldwide industry 
book publishers are not limiting themselves to the standard 
religion shelf items available now from christianoriented 
publishers are cookbooks exercise manuals financial guides and 
novels all with a spiritual bent 
and exhibitor adeeb howrani said a lot of people are wearing the 
good word on their chests 
people will spend 18 or 20 for a nike tshirt he said 
its not unreasonable to ask 1295 for a tshirt that expresses a 
positive message 
howrani who was wearing a shirt reading signed sealed 
delivered im yours lord said he does not incorporate any 
secular images on his products 
theres so much in the bible its almost ridiculous to take an 
idea from somewhere else he said 
dave bordon sales manager for infinity video of tulsa okla 
said his company is offering tapes such as idol busters a 
takeoff of the ghostbusters movies to capture the teenage

state district judge allan mcguanes 
verdict is in on the basic black of the bench its boring 
after 13 years as a judge he has taken to spicing up his 
wardrobe with red and gray robes 
now hes considering green and maybe some pastels 
its just to put a little color in my life mcguane said 
monday be a little different theres a real monotony to everyone 
wearing black 
theres no rule that a judge must wear black its just a 
tradition he said and you should see what some of them wear 
underneath their robes to express their individuality 
some lawyers think they look good others think i am out of my 
gourd mcguane said 
mcguane doesnt know how judges came to wear black one story is 
that oliver wendell holmes began the tradition among american 
jurists after their british counterparts donned black as a mark of 
mourning for queen victoria 
i dont know why mcguane said she wasnt our queen 
lawyers have been trying to figure out whether there is any 
correlation between mcguanes mood and the color of his robes will 
he look kindly on their clients when he is wrapped in rosy red 
there really isnt but it keeps them busy and out of 
mischief mcguane said 
mcguane said the final arbiter of his garb is assistant 
clerkmagistrate margaret palmeri 
she wont let me go into the courtroom wearing something that 
clashes with whats shes wearing mcguane said shes the color

france is readying a display of sparkle power 
culture and whimsy for this weeks climax of the french revolution 
bicentennial 
the focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders on 
spectacular parades and fireworks and on the inauguration of a new 
opera house at the place de la bastille where a mob stormed the 
hated bastille prison on july 14 1789 to launch the revolution 
among the chiefs of state on hand will be president bush for the 
annual economic summit of the worlds seven largest industrial 
democracies by chance this year is frances turn to be host 
the result depending on the point of view is expected to be the 
city of light at its most enchanting or a securityimposed 
gridlock on a scale the developed world has never seen 
it will either be a fitting tribute to one of the founding events 
of the modern age or an exercise in selfcongratulation that 
ignores both the cruel and brutal side of the revolution and the 
plight of todays poor and oppressed 
bicentennial celebrations and commemorations have been in full 
swing all year but the big weekend gets started thursday when 
president francois mitterrand has all his outoftown guests bush 
and the other leaders of the rich countries but also the leaders of 
bangladesh mali india and egypt and other countries over for 
lunch 
later on when the economic summit gets moving the leaders of 
the poor and middleincome countries wind up relegated to a 
secondclass itinerary dinner with premier michel rocard and the 
like which reportedly has even mitterrands socialist supporters 
uneasy 
a counterbicentennial demonstration and concert last weekend 
on the theme that the commemoration should have more to do with the 
third world and less with solemn ceremonies and fancy dinners drew 
an estimated 100000 people to the place de la bastille 
apparently mitterrands original plan was to mount an encounter 
between leaders representing all continents and rich and poor 
countries but he was unable to win support for the idea from his 
summit partners 
with all the dignitaries dashing about town paris will see its 
most stringent security ever including a dirigible looking down 
from above and what are expected to be epochal traffic jams 
police say expressways and city streets will be shut without 
warning when motorcades of the 30 leaders are about to pass a chunk 
of central paris is already a noparking zone and will be offlimits 
to ordinary vehicles for three days 
thursday night bush and the other leaders get a taste of culture 
at the inaugural performance in the hightech opera house that 
mitterrand has ordered built at the bastille just across a busy 
square from where the prison once stood 
the new building at the gate of the newly upgraded eastern 
section of the city is supposed to bring opera to the people but 
news of its construction has been overshadowed by controversy over 
its program 
conductor daniel barenboim was fired in january over what the 
government said were his elitist views and high salary it took 
until may to get a new musical director and regular performances 
will not start until next year 
friday is bastille day featuring two severely contrasting 
parades on the champselysees the traditional military display 
with missiles tanks helicopters and fighter planes makes its 
deafening way down the avenue in the morning 
later that night a muchanticipated spectacle choreographed by 
the bad boy of french advertising jeanpaul goude portraying the 
ideals of the revolution through twists on national stereotypes 
they are cliches but im trying to be positive with the 
cliches goude said monday 
the images range from britons parading in artificial rain to 
russians dancing with a bear on ice to africans on live zebras to 
the florida aampm university marching band strutting backward all the 
way down the avenue 
its michael jacksons moonwalk goude said i asked them 
if they could do the moonwalk from the etoile to concorde and they 
said no problem very american theyre doing a salute to james 
brown 
the summit itself with chief items on the agenda expected to be 
the debt crisis and global environmental action begins friday under 
the new pyramid entrance to the louvre museum which is closed for 
three days to give way to the leaders of france britain italy 
canada japan west germany and the united states 
most of the meetings however will be in the justfinished 
cubeshaped arch in the la defense complex on the capitals western 
edge 
if everyone is not exhausted by saturday night they are invited 
to watch the citys annual fireworks display near the eiffel tower 
wrapping up the bicentennial celebrations with some of the flash and 
spark that started it all in july 1789

effort to become the premier of italy for a sixth time 
he received the mandate to try to form italys 49th postwar 
government from president francesco cossiga on sunday and met monday 
with caretaker premier ciriaco de mita 
andreotti was expected to begin his consultations with various 
party leaders today

the dominant christian democrats after de mita said last week that 
he could not revive the fiveparty coalition he led for 13 months 
until resigning may 19

leadership from the socialists the second largest party after the 
christian democrats in the governing coalition 
italian newspapers have reported that socialist leader bettino 
craxi who blocked de mitas effort to revive his coalition has 
pledged not to oppose andreotti 
andreotti said he would work to revive the five party coalition 
christian democrats socialists and the small republican liberal 
and social democrat parties which has governed in recent years 
he predicted the negotiations to form a new government would be 
delayed by preparations for the annual meeting of the seven major

successively in 197679

the first appearance of the ellington band in 
carnegie hall jan 23 1943 included the premiere of duke 
ellingtons 50minute black brown and beige subtitled a tone 
parallel to the history of the negro in america 
that concert was repeated monday night as the first of three 
landmark jazz concerts at carnegie hall to be recreated this 
week 
black brown and beige played by an 18piece allstar jazz 
orchestra conducted by maurice peress sounded most impressive 
because of some familiarity with it and with later extended 
symphonic compositions by ellington the 1989 audience probably 
appreciated it more than its first hearers 
black brown and beige begins with work song and come 
sunday frank wess played come sunday on a saxophone johnny 
hodges used to use words to come sunday came later the only 
singing in black brown and beige is the blues sung 
originally by betty roche and monday by the impressive melodee 
savage 
peress said ellington wrote a 30page narrative about a mythical 
character going from slavery to harlem which included the lyrics to 
the blues peress said the composer switched from his original 
intent opera to the instrumental black brown and beige 
ellingtons introduction to each of the pieces three parts was 
recorded and played to mondays audience ellington didnt fully 
explain his intentions always assuming that his audience was 
knowledgeable but his introduction was instructive 
concerts were longer in 1943 than today the first half also 
included musical portraits of three black entertainers and the 
sevenminute black and tan fantasy after that ellington surely 
introduced the saxophone trumpet and trombone soloists it wasnt 
done on monday 
the second half had a number of concertos pieces about five 
minutes long that ellington composed as solos for certain players 
accompanied by the band milt hinton played jack the bear 
written for jimmy blanton who died before the 1943 concert tenor 
saxophonist bill easley played ben websters part on cotton tail 
jon faddis made his trumpet speak in boy meets horn a piece 
thats evocative faddis was as impressive there as he was in 
numbers calling for him to be fast and flashy sir roland hanna 
played piano miss savages hard swinging of rose of the rio 
grande which ellington didnt write was so good that peress had 
her repeat it 
the series of concertos lacked a needed spark of excitement that 
ellingtons stage style undoubtedly added in the original concert 
the evening ended beautifully with hinton clarinettist jimmy 
hamilton who played in the ellington band for 26 years faddis and 
trombonist dave bargeron in front of the band blending on mood

congress now rushing to investigate 
allegations of reaganera abuses at the department of housing and 
urban development was warned repeatedly in the past decade that lax 
management left the agency ripe for graft 
we had too many fires and we just had one fire department 
rep barney frank said monday on why congress did little in response 
to the warnings 
problems at hud were outlined in dozens of reports by the 
agencys inspector general and the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress 
congressional staffs just arent big enough and members of 
congress just dont have enough time said frank dmass a 
member of two committees that oversee hud programs these people 
at hud just didnt care about the programs so we had to spend most 
of our time just trying to keep the programs from being destroyed 
many of the statements found in the reports now seem prophetic 
warning of problems now under congressional scrutiny including 
influencepeddling poorly targeted programs and millions of dollars 
in missing funds 
project selections had been based upon political consideration 
rather than merit the gaos john h luke told congress in october 
1984 at one of the few hearings held to explore problems at hud 
luke was testifying about revised loan policies for housing for the 
elderly and handicapped 
the changes he said reduced accountability and in turn limits 
the departments ability to explain and defend its decisions 
new hud secretary jack kemp last week suspended one of the 
departments elderly housing programs because 30 percent of the 
projects had resulted in foreclosures many of the projects had low 
occupancy rates which an internal audit blamed on hud for approving 
large developments despite warnings the area housing market would 
not support them 
in january 1984 three years into the reagan administration the 
gao criticized the management style of thenhud secretary samuel 
pierce in a report to congress the report said pierce delegated 
most decisionmaking and did not establish a centralized management 
process to keep track of his deputies 
congress now is investigating allegations that political 
influence played a role in major hud project awards and that 
political appointees often overruled career agency officials in 
awarding hud funds 
a high turnover rate among the agencys brass also weakened hud 
management the gao warned 
many of those now facing congressional scrutiny are former hud 
officials who became private real estate developers or consultants 
and profited in their new jobs by winning hud work 
the gao management study also said hud had trouble tracking its 
money because most of its accounting was done by hand most of the 
systems that had been automated were obsolete the report said 
huds inspector general audited private escrow agents hired by 
the agency to handle sales and acquisitions of property and found 
the agents often were late paying hud its money and in some cases 
did not pay at all the agency didnt know about most of the lapses 
because of poor accounting the audits said 
testimony to a house subcommittee investigating hud has indicated 
that many major decisions were made by pierces top aide deborah 
gore dean who had no previous experience in housing but had 
considerable contacts with influential republicans 
congress also is investigating the awarding of hud money to 
projects that while qualified were not ranked as priority programs 
we found that some applications with low project points were 
funded the gao said in a march 1985 report that reviewed the 
selection process used to award huds coveted urban development 
action grants 
another report sent to congress in april 1988 said surplus funds 
received by public housing agencies were used to pay for office 
furniture softball uniforms birthday cards holiday parties and 
exercise equipment 
one such agency gao said used 76000 to buy equipment and pay 
travel expenses for a drum and bugle corps to represent the agency 
at parades and other festivities 
the gao said the hud official in charge of the program was aware 
some of the funds were not spent on housing but opposed efforts to 
establish guidelines on how the money could be spent

a bottlenose dolphin that died after 
swimming up the east and hudson rivers was infected by a parasite 
that apparently affected its sense of direction an autopsy revealed 
the dolphin which attracted the interest of marine experts and 
the public for three weeks was an 8foot 600pound female that had 
given birth to at least 12 calves in more than 30 years in the 
atlantic ocean biologists said monday 
as far as dolphins go i think she had a pretty good life it 
was a long one anyway said samuel sadove a marine biologist who 
conducted the autopsy sadove director of the okeanos ocean 
research foundation said dolphins have been known to live 37 years 
the ultimate cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage the body 
was found sunday in the hudson 
there was no immediate indication that pollution or any toxic 
chemicals contributed to the death sadove said but he added that 
further tissue tests were planned 
the dolphin was first noticed june 20 in the east river between 
manhattan and long island it stayed in the river for about 11 days 
then headed into the hudson and upriver two weeks ago it was 
sighted as far north as kingston more than 80 miles upriver from 
new york harbor 
the dolphin had been infected two or three months ago by a worm 
ingested with infected food sadove said the parasite lodged in the 
sinuses causing a disease called nasitroma which is common in 
marine mammals he said 
the parasite invaded the brain possibly affecting the animals 
sense of direction and environment sadove said 
in addition there were signs of severe stress from being in 
fresh water but returning the animal to the sea would not have 
saved it sadove said

installing president bushs choice to head the 
government nuclear weapons program would be like putting the joker 
in charge of gotham city an environmental group says 
victor stello jr lacks commitment to improving safety at the 
decrepit weapons facilities greenpeace and other environmental 
groups said monday 
stellos selection runs counter to bushs professed desire to 
restore public confidence in the weapons complex by tightening 
environmental controls and strengthening safety rules greenpeace 
said 
stello embodies the very attitudes that have brought the 
department of energy where it is today to a crashing halt said 
stephen schwartz a greenpeace spokesman putting victor stello in 
charge of nuclear weapons production is like putting the joker in 
charge of gotham city 
greenpeace said several other citizen groups including the 
environmental policy institute and the union of concerned 
scientists are joining in a letterwriting campaign to try to block 
stellos confirmation by the senate armed services committee 
nrc spokesman joseph fouchard said stello had not seen the 
greenpeace announcement but was not commenting on things of this 
kind 
bush said last month he will nominate stello as assistant energy 
secretary for defense programs no senate hearing has yet been 
scheduled 
stello 54 is a nuclear engineer who joined the atomic energy 
commission the predecessor of both the nuclear regulatory 
commission and the energy department in 1966 he currently is the 
nrcs executive director for operations in effect the official most 
directly responsible for safety in commercial nuclear plants 
stellos critics accuse him of siding with utilities in nrc 
disputes over compliance with commission rules and say he has 
thwarted investigations by his own agency into rules violations 
greenpeace said it had requested a meeting with energy secretary 
james d watkins to discuss the stello selection watkins told a 
news conference june 27 that stello has the experience and desire to 
run the nuclear weapons program even if hes a b student to many 
people and he has some chinks in his armor 
will callicott a department spokesman said monday that stello 
still has watkins full support 
watkins meanwhile announced that george h miller of the 
lawrence livermore national laboratory will become his special 
scientific adviser on weapons watkins had said earlier he planned 
to hire an expert in weapons research and production to offset 
stellos lack of experience in military applications of atomic power 
stello would replace troy e wade ii who has held the position 
on an interim basis since august 1987 
the job of weapons chief has taken on added visibility and 
political sensitivity since the program encountered a series of 
technical and management setbacks last year that for the first 
time halted the nations production of nuclear arms materials 
stellos main responsibility would be to get the program running 
again 
lando zech who stepped down as nrc chairman june 30 vigorously 
defended stello in a farewell news conference calling him an 
outstanding public servant

record company rereleased their old hits 
the pop performers were in federal court monday as a trial began 
in their lawsuit against gusto records and gml 
the singers filed suit in us district court in december 1987 to 
determine ownership of the rights to a collection of oldies such as 
thomas raindrops keep fallin on my head the shirelles 
soldier boy and pitneys liberty valance 
the lawsuit claims that master recordings used to make the 
original records passed through several firms such as cbs and 
koala before being seized improperly by gusto

to royalties from record sales or bargained them away to other 
record companies

if so how much said carey thompson an attorney for the record 
companies 
the lawsuit charges that gusto failed to pay them royalties of 
well in excess of 10000 each

shirley owens alston doris coley jackson and beverly lee are 
represented by attorneys samuel lipshie and ira greenberg

crack cocaine highly addictive and relatively 
cheap is now available in almost every state thanks to the violent 
gangs that distribute it the drug enforcement administration says 
crack first noted in three us cities in 1981 is the fast 
food of drugs the dea reports in a new study crackcocaine 
overview 1989 
crack cocaine literally exploded on the drug scene during 1986 
and was reported available in 28 states and the district of 
columbia the report says 
it is currently available in almost every state the report 
says dea spokesman cornelius dougherty added monday i dont know 
if there are any states where crack a smokeable form of cocaine 
has not made an appearance 
the dea has stepped up enforcement seizing about 60000 
kilograms of cocaine in 1988 compared with only 200 kilograms in 
1977 
but the crack epidemic still spread partly because of extremely 
efficient and violent american and jamaican gangs that distribute 
the drug and because crack is highly addictive and relatively cheap 
the report says 
the consumer is supplied with a readytouse material that can 
be purchased quickly and for small amounts of money the report 
said this opens the consumer market to a wider spectrum of 
abusers including youth and the poor 
cocaine hydrochloride at a cost of 200 per gram on the street 
generally is 70 percent pure while crack at a cost of 10 for a 
onetenth of a gram dose is sold at purity levels of 75 percent to 
90 percent the dea says 
never before has any form of cocaine been available at such low 
cost and high potency the report said 
the crack problem has spread to rural and suburban areas 
and is now manifesting itself in all strata of society the 
report said but added crack cocaine remains a predominantly 
innercity urban phenomenon that is mainly confined to minority 
sections 
there the gangs that once fought each other over turf and gang 
colors now make big money selling crack with the los angelesbased 
crips and bloods and the jamaican posses taking the lead operating 
on a no innocent bystander theory the report said 
some of the gangs subgroups are showing signs of cooperating 
with each other in drug trafficking to promote drug sales and to set 
up funds for bail and attorneys the report said 
the more successful drug sets are becoming organized it 
said they operate in a more businesslike manner are 
profitoriented and sophisticated in tactics ie use of computers 
and standard business practices 
crack use first was noted in this country in 1981 in los angeles 
san diego and houston it was considered a localized phenomenon 
until it became a serious problem in new york city in late 1985 
during the next two years the dea detected gang involvement in 
crack trafficking resulting in the widespread surge of availability 
crack is made by converting coca leaf to cocaine base to cocaine 
hydrochloride and then back to a new cleaner cocaine base 
a person who smokes crack receives an almost instantaneous 
intense high lasting only a short period of time usually eight to 
10 minutes which is often followed by depression and manic 
episodes the report said the user is often in a situation 
where he must consume larger and larger amounts of crack to even out 
these extreme periods of crack highs and lows

solidarity activists jailed for their 
political activities just a year ago say they did not expect then 
to wind up mingling with top communist leaders at a luncheon hosted 
by president bush 
bush who hosted the lawn luncheon monday was seated between 
historian bronislaw geremek leader of the solidarity delegation in 
the national assembly and the wife of polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski 
such a meeting has never happened where the us president 
jaruzelski and the polish criminals are all present joked 
historian adam michnik a deputy in the sejm who had spent years in 
jail for political activities 
at the other end of a shady patio bushs wife barbara was next 
to jaruzelski at a table including janusz onyszkiewicz the 
solidarity national spokesman and jozef slisz the head of the 
farmers rural solidarity 
its rather strange when you think that a year ago i was in 
prison said onyszkiewicz now a sejm deputy he was arrested amid 
labor unrest in may 1988 when authorities accused him of passing 
false information to foreign journalists 
other prominent government officials and some two dozen members 
of the independent union movement chatted together with american 
guests under a large canopy on the back lawn of the residence of 
us ambassador john davis 
the friendly atmosphere contrasted sharply with bushs 1987 visit 
to poland as vice president when many of the solidarity guests were 
harassed by security forces for their political activities 
when bush met solidarity leader lech walesa at the ambassadors 
residence during that visit the union was still banned jaruzelski 
proclaimed martial law in december 1981 to suppress the movement 
that had electrified the nation when first legalized in august 1980 
walesa did not attend the lunch instead he invited bush to his 
home today in the port of gdansk where he founded solidarity in 
1980 
while others dipped into minted cantaloupe soup and tasted endive 
and watercress salad michnik couldnt resist flashing solidaritys 
v for victory 
michnik who had been imprisoned for his political activities 
also gave the us businessman sitting next to him an autographed 
copy of an underground political quarterly he edits he now also 
edits the oppositions governmentsanctioned daily newspaper 
looking east as well as west for support walesa told michniks 
daily that he would accept if soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
invited him to a meeting 
in an interview with nbc news walesa said he admires gorbachev 
and called him a great juggler of great class he added he 
has to be a great juggler to make it 
in just a year there have been two waves of labor unrest 
historic round table reform negotiations between communist 
authorities and the opposition and polands freest elections in 40 
years 
lunch for guests on the lawn was served at round tables in a 
gesture to the political agreements bush said in a toast 
the president also evoked the dramatic evolution saying so 
much has changed these are hopeful times in poland 
the guests clapped as jaruzelski raised his glass and said he was 
making his first visit ever to the red brick official us residence 
not far from his own home 
the most moving remarks came from geremek who was not scheduled 
to speak in the official program 
roughly two years ago vice president bush and mrs bush talked 
with members of solidarity right in this house and we heard words 
of hope i think none of us thought then we would meet here in such 
circumstances he said 
in the past foreign leaders often met with solidarity 
representatives but never in the company of government and party 
officials 
solidaritys stunning victory and the communist partys severe 
setback in june elections have transformed the once illegal group of 
determined activists into a power center

pregnant women who have aids will be given an 
antiaids drug for the first time in an experiment to determine if 
the drug can prevent their babies from developing the fatal disease 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
announced monday the experiment with the drug zidovudine more 
commonly known as azt will be conducted on 10 women infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
dr anthony s fauci director of the institute said the 
experiment is an effort to find a way of treating one of the fastest 
growing categories of aids patients newborn infants 
the prognosis for children infected with hiv is grim said 
fauci in a statement released by his agency he said babies born to 
women infected with aids have a 25 to 40 percent chance of 
contracting aids and the disease progresses much more rapidly in 
infants than in adults 
of those diagnosed before their first birthday half die within 
six months of diagnosis said fauci it is impossible to count 
the costs in pain and heartbreak and the social and economic burden 
of caring for these children is staggering 
since 1981 there have been 1600 cases of aids among children 
up to three times that number are thought to be infected with hiv 
the institute said little is known about how aids is transmitted 
from mother to baby but it is thought to occur either during 
development within the mother at birth through contact with the 
mothers blood or from breast milk after birth 
most aids infants are born to mothers who are intravenous drug 
users or who have been sexual partners of drug users 
all of the experiments will be on women who test positive for 
hiv but who are not showing aids symptoms 
in the first phase of the study researchers will enroll six 
women with no recent history of drug abuse after the six have 
completed their course of treatment the investigators then will 
treat four women who are intravenous drug abusers and use methadone 
an approved pharmaceutical used to wean patients from illegal drugs 
all 10 women will start the study with azt injections and then 
continue through the rest of their pregnancy by taking 200 milligram 
azt pills five times a day when the test subjects go into labor 
azt will again be injected 
following delivery the babies will be carefully monitored for 18 
months for aids and to determine if the azt treatment affected their 
development 
the experimental treatment will be directed by researchers from 
the university of miami and the ucla school of medicine in los 
angeles 
azt is the only approved antiviral drug now available for general 
prescription for treating aids the drug can have serious toxic side 
effects 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus most 
often is spread through close contact with blood blood products or 
semen from infected persons 
as of may 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 97193 americans 
of whom more than half or 56468 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is giving 
a chilly reception to a top bank regulators plan that would rival 
his own initiative for easing third world debt problems 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp says his proposal to partially protect banks from defaults by 
debtor nations complements the brady plan 
but brady told reporters monday we dont think that is 
necessary at this point in time 
after debtsparked riots in venezuela the treasury secretary 
launched an effort in march to persuade banks to reduce the crushing 
13 trillion debt borne by third world nations in latin america 
asia and africa it was a marked departure from reagan 
administration policy which emphasized new lending rather than debt 
reduction 
seidman would take the brady plan one step further by 
establishing an international debt insurer to encourage banks to 
forego repayment of part of the debt by guaranteeing repayment of a 
large part of the remaining loans 
it also would seek to start new money flowing into cashstarved 
countries by partly guaranteeing new loans to countries that enact 
economic reforms 
the new agency would be funded by premiums from the banks 
themselves depending on how much debt they held and by 
contributions from the world bank and international monetary fund 
which are supported by member governments 
brady who leaves this week for an economic summit meeting of the 
worlds seven largest industrial powers said the group has 
previously rejected the creation of an international organization to 
deal with the debt problem 
it has been thought about before and not seen to be as good a 
way as the way we are going brady said 
john haseltine of the institute for international finance which 
represents us and foreign commercial banks said it is unclear to 
what extent the banks participation will be voluntary an important 
feature if banks are to remain willing to continue lending to 
debtors 
the seidman plan would give insured debt senior status to 
other debt as a way of discouraging banks from being free 
riders thus banks that didnt go along with debt reduction would 
be the first to lose money in the event of a default 
seidman first raised his idea publicly in a march speech to the 
bretton woods committee a group of former top government officials 
who study international financial issues he plans to present the 
detailed plan at a bretton woods dinner on thursday 
seidmans outline describes the current debt reduction process as 
a stalemate but brady said he was encouraged by progress in talks 
between mexico and its creditor banks in what is seen as the first 
test of his plan 
the two sides reportedly have agreed to the major elements of a 
plan to provide mexico with 3 billion in debt relief but some 
issues remain to be settled

while pinstriped city slickers haggle 
over taxes insurance and serious issues in the legislature 
cowboylegislator john carpenter keeps a vigil for varmints who try 
to bushwack cowboys rights 
there arent too many of us left anymore carpenter said 
weve got to try and preserve our way of life 
when a bill to regulate sale and possession of assault rifles 
came up for a vote in the assembly the cow county republican rose 
in opposition 
he wasnt against banning assault rifles he was against a clause 
in the bill aimed at las vegas gangs that would have outlawed knives 
with 4inch blades 
holding his trusty old timer pocketknife aloft during floor 
debate he drawled if you passed this law as is every cowboy in 
the state would be a lawbreaker 
besides he added with a gary cooper grin there are a few 
little operations we have to perform out there on the ranch 
referring to the castration of bulls 
the bill was amended in favor of the cowboys and passed 
unanimously 
the 59yearold fallon native also lauded a bill that would fence 
off devils holes abandoned mine shafts that dot the nevada 
landscape because cowboys and their horses could fall down one of 
those holes 
carpenter first elected from elko county to the assembly in 
1985 has applied his own version of horse sense to other matters 
he suggested castration as an apt punishment for sex offenders 
when someone said sex crimes were more of a mental problem 
carpenter said then maybe we should cut off that part of their 
anatomy 
carpenters biggest showdown came over a measure about wild 
horses the bill backed by animal rights activists would have made 
it a felony to shoot a wild horse it also would have given the 
activists the upper hand over ranchers on a commission for the 
preservation of wild horses 
the bill was in response to recent shootings of more than 1000 
wild horses on nevadas northern and central ranges animal rights 
advocates often blame ranchers for such killings because ranchers 
believe the mustangs rob cows and sheep of valuable forage 
environmentalists and animal lovers rose with heartfelt speeches 
about the beauty of wild horses and their inherent right to roam the 
range 
carpenter stood in opposition and when the dust cleared he won 
two victories the penalty for shooting a wild horse was reduced to 
a gross misdemeanor and ranchers would have as much say as wild 
horse advocates on the commission 
during the peak of his ranching career carpenter said he has 
paid taxes in eight nevada counties where he ran 20000 sheep 
and 7000 cows on ranches near austin fallon ely and elko 
in the old days carpenter said they used to round up the 
wild horses keep the good ones and sell the other ones at auction 
a lot of the old ones went for dog food but it kept the population 
under control 
a year and a half ago carpenter sold the last of his livestock 
operations now he works out of his ranchers realty in elko where 
he owns a few businesses 
but hes getting tired of town life 
once youre a rancher youre always a rancher carpenter 
said you cant get it out of your blood or off your boots

a federal prosecutor says the decision by miami 
judge alcee l hastings to return 845000 in confiscated cash to a 
pair of convicted racketeers shocked him 
i was stunned by the forfeiture james deichert of the 
federal organized crime strike force in atlanta said monday at the 
start of hearings on hastings senate impeachment trial out of 
the blue he was reversing himself 
house members who are serving as prosecutors at the impeachment 
trial say the decision to return the money came just days after an 
agreement was cemented for a 150000 payoff to the federal judge 
hastings is accused of plotting with washington attorney william 
borders to get the payoff in exchange for returning the forfeited 
cash and keeping the defendants out of prison 
impeachment charges approved a year ago by the house also accuse 
hastings of lying to the jury that acquitted him at his 1983 
briberyconspiracy trial and improperly disclosing information 
obtained from a federal wiretap 
hastings attorney terence anderson of miami contends his client 
was the innocent dupe of borders an old law school classmate who 
was an influential lawyer in washington in the late 1970s 
borders was convicted in the bribery case and went to prison 
anderson called him a bigtime rainmaker who in order to get 
payoffs claimed to have influence with hastings 
alcee l hastings was is and will forever be an innocent 
man anderson said 
rep john bryant dtexas told the senate panel monday that 
hastings actions present a pattern of misconduct which cannot be 
tolerated in a united states district judge 
bryant said the senate should expel hastings from the bench even 
though he was found innocent in criminal court that acquittal was 
the product of repeated lies and the production of fabricated 
evidence at his criminal trial he said 
judge hastings cannot be prosecuted again but he can be 
removed from office bryant said 
evidence is being heard by a 12member panel because senators do 
not want to tie up the floor and slow the pace of legislation for 
weeks the proceedings are being videotaped for viewing at the

special interests that lobby the same lawmakers 
they pay for speaking engagements are undermining the debate in 
congress common cause says in its latest study of congressional 
speechmakingforhire 
defense contractors directed speaking fees last year to members 
of the armed services committees tobacco fertilizer and grocery 
interests heard from members of the agriculture committees bankers 
the securities industry and home builders listened to the banking 
committee members 
millions of dollars in special interest honoraria fees are 
undermining the integrity and credibility of congress common 
cause president fred wertheimer said monday releasing the 
congressional watchdogs study of 1988 honoraria giving 
the groups annual report takes on new urgency this year with 
clamor growing for an end to lawmakers outside income 
president bush on july 7 sent congress legislation to end the 
honoraria system by jan 1 1991 numerous lawmakers have called for 
the same thing but the price would be a politically risky 
congressional pay raise that would compensate for the loss of 
speaking fee income 
when lawmakers considered boosting their salaries by 51 percent 
earlier this year the plan was killed after a public outcry 
task forces in both houses are expected to consider the pay issue 
again along with reform of house and senate rules some members 
suggest a salary increase be phased in over several years 
common cause said 20 groups gave at least 50000 in honoraria to 
members of congress in 1988 led by the tobacco institutes spending 
of 123400 the national association of broadcasters 113500 and 
the 106550 spent by the american bankers association 
the study found the 11 leading givers among defense contractors 
paid a combined 457387 to all members of congress with 67 percent 
directed to members of the house and senate armed services 
committees and lawmakers on the defense appropriations subcommittees 
the national association of broadcasters paid 60 percent of its 
113500 in honoraria to members of committees dealing with 
communications the house energy and commerce and the senate 
commerce committees the study said 
twentynine house and senate members reported nab honoraria and 
travel reimbursement for appearances in las vegas and seven for 
appearances in hawaii 
the national venture capital association which favors a lower 
capital gains tax paid 88 percent of its 33000 in honoraria to 22 
members of the taxwriting house ways and means and senate finance 
committees according to the study 
the national cable television association gave 69 percent of its 
53700 in honoraria to committee members dealing with legislation 
affecting the cable industry including copyright bills 
a similar pattern emerged for individual lawmakers 
rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the energy and 
commerce health and the environment subcommittee received 76 
percent of his total 71750 in honoraria from commerce and 
healthrelated interests 
rep william dickinson rala ranking republican on the house 
armed services committee received 96 percent of his 32250 
honoraria from defenserelated interests 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee rep kika de la 
garza dtexas earned 29800 in total honoraria 97 percent of it 
from agriculturerelated interests 
the tobacco institute spread its speaking fees around paying 85 
house members and eight senators rjrnabisco philip morris and 
the smokeless tobacco council gave another 138000 to lawmakers 
common cause found 
house members can keep up to 26850 in outside income mainly 
honoraria and must donate the rest to charity senators can keep up 
to 35800 
members of congress can keep up to 2000 for any single 
appearance speech or article

speaker thomas s foley says hell keep the 
house focused on legislation and wont let lawmakers get dragged 
into another pay raise dispute until theres bipartisan support 
and public acceptance 
foley said monday that president bushs proposal last week to 
raise pay for judges and top executivebranch officials left the 
door open for congress to give itself a pay raise although there 
was no specific recommendation 
but foley said that while bush and former president reagan 
supported the increases they allowed republican campaign operatives 
to blame the democraticcontrolled congress that shouldnt happen 
again foley told a luncheon of associated press executives and 
reporters 
i dont want to get into something where the president says 
yes and the congressional campaign committee says no foley said 
thats unacceptable that sort of goodcop badcop routine 
foley said it was also unlikely the house would approve bushs 
proposal for 25 percent pay raises for federal judges and top 
executive branch officials without also considering a congressional 
pay raise 
foley opposes such a connection but said others are not willing 
to go along 
there will be no disconnection between judges and the 
executive branch and congress the underlying reality of that in 
my judgment is that the votes do not exist to do it he said 
a special bipartisan committee in the house is examining ethical 
questions including whether congressional pay should be increased 
in exchange for tighter restrictions on outside income such as 
speech honoraria 
foley said any pay raise would have to be of a reasonable scale 
and would have to be supported by both republicans and democrats in 
congress and in the white house 
foley blamed the news media for unprofessional hype that 
helped shoot down a 51 percent congressional pay raise in february 
and said a similar outcry would make it hard to bring up a pay 
proposal again 
if its a here they go again sort of thing beating up on 
the congress im not going to put lawmakers through that he 
said 
the speaker said the house has a full agenda of legislation on 
returning from the fourth of july holiday including the bill to 
bail out and toughen regulation of the savings and loan industry 
the 13 annual spending bills defense policy child care and the 
clean air bill 
foley repeated his position that he would prefer legislation 
short of a constitutional amendment to overcome a supreme court 
decision that allows flag burning there were fervent pleas from 
some members for such an amendment before the break

eat right and stay healthy says the 
agriculture department that includes a smidgen of chromium to keep 
things bright 
drinking a sugary soda after eating a starchy meal and then ice 
cream smothered with chocolate fudge can drain your body of 
chromium says the departments agricultural research service 
and few of us get enough of this essential element as it is 
chromium keeps insulin levels in check by making the hormone more 
efficient at regulating blood sugar levels the agency said and the 
more insulin secreted to process sugars from a meal the more 
chromium the body uses and loses 
when theres not enough chromium the body pumps out more 
insulin said richard a anderson who specializes in chromium 
research in the agency 
few foods provide more than 10 percent to 15 percent of the 
minimum suggested intake or chromium he said a handful of 
breakfast cereals provide more than 25 percent 
and beer and wine are good sources of chromium 
anderson recommends eating a variety of fresh fruits vegetables 
dairy and whole wheat products and meat some foods and beverages 
such as beer pick up chromium from equipment during processing he 
said but other foods lose natural chromium in the refining process 
but for the most part it all boils down to commonsense advice 
usda has in four new booklets designed to help americans shop for 
food fix quick meals eat out and snack 
susan welsh director of nutrition education for the departments 
human nutrition information service said monday that agency studies 
indicate consumers may be confused by and weary of seemingly 
conflicting advice on what they should and shouldnt eat 
the new effort including the booklets is intended to let people 
know they can eat healthier without changing all their eating 
habits overnight or giving up their favorite foods she said 
among the commonsense advice is to eat a variety of food 
maintain desirable weight and eat food with adequate starch and 
fiber the agency suggests avoiding eating too much food with fat 
saturated fat sugar or sodium 
the suggestions are based on the dietary guidelines for americans 
developed by usda and the department of health and human services in 
1980 the guidelines slightly revised in 1985 are being reviewed 
for further changes possibly by 1991 
booklets include 
preparing foods and planning menus using the dietary guidelines 
250 item no 172v 
making bag lunches snacks and desserts using the dietary 
guidelines 250 item no 173v 
shopping for food and making meals in minutes using the dietary 
guidelines 3 item no 174v 
eating better when eating out using the dietary guidelines 
150 item no 175v 
the booklets may be ordered from consumer information center

eastern airlines ranks high in ontime 
performance but also leads the industry in complaints from 
consumers according to a transportation department monthly report 
the departments air travel consumer report released monday 
showed eastern with 1310 complaints to the government per 100000 
passengers more than twice the rate of any other airline 
the figures do not cover complaints made directly to the airlines 
but only those received by the government 
pan american was second with 602 complaints per 100000 fliers 
followed by trans world airlines with 459 at the bottom of the 
list of 21 airlines were aloha and tower airlines with no complaints 
the report covers a wide variety of consumer complaints 
including problems with fares overbooking baggage handling 
customer service advertising and smoking on flights 
in the category for lost or mishandled baggage eastern had the 
lowest number of reports 267 per 1000 passengers in may the 
reports on baggage and the flight performance were for may and 
overall consumer complaints to the government covered june 
the report cautions that the baggage statistics are based on 
reports from the airlines and may not be comparable because carriers 
have differing methods of reporting 
the report showed america west leading in ontime performance 
with 917 percent of its flights arriving on time in may followed 
by eastern with 872 percent and alaska airlines with 87 percent 
the report noted however that the eastern statistics covered far 
fewer flights than normal because of the ongoing walkout by the 
airlines machinists union which has been joined by pilots and 
flight attendants 
eastern and alaska airlines both reported no chronically late 
flights in may leading that category was pan american with 56 
percent of its flights late more than 70 percent of the time

the air force says pilots and air crews will be 
allowed to wear soft contact lenses because they can improve 
eyesight under combat conditions 
pilots and crews in fighter attack and reconnaissance aircraft 
as well as instructor pilots and those whose duty requires the use 
of night vision goggles will be issued the lenses said a statement 
issued monday at the pentagon 
as in the past new pilots will be required to prove they have 
perfect or 2020 vision said a spokeswoman for the air force 
surgeon general 
but if a pilot or crew members vision worsens after they have 
completed their training and it can be corrected to the 2020 
level he or she will be allowed to use either spectacles or the 
soft contact lenses said spokeswoman patti turner 
now its their choice ms turner said 
the new policy is effective immediately she said 
a statement issued at the pentagon said soft lenses have been 
shown to improve the combat capability of some us air force crew 
members who require vision correcting lenses 
their use has been proven to provide an operational advantage 
over the wear of spectacles in missions which require maneuvering 
flight the use of night vision goggles the constant wear of an 
oxygen mask and the ability to quickly look to the far limits of 
lateral gaze the statement said 
ms turner said pilots and aircrews will only be allowed to use 
extendedwear lenses since those are better suited to the 
conditions crews will encounter 
however the lenses will not be allowed to be worn around the 
clock or when sleeping ms turner said nor will tinted or 
disposable types of lenses be allowed 
also those who choose to use the lenses must keep their glasses 
at hand in the event that they encounter a problem or lose one she 
added 
while only certain fliers will be issued the lenses others will 
be able to purchase them through civilian eye care specialists after 
the approval of their flight surgeon the statement said 
army spokeswoman paige eversole said helicopter and fixedwing 
pilots are still not allowed to use contact lenses although that 
matter is being studied

the hunt brothers heirs to one of the worlds 
greatest fortunes are in court defending a partnership created to 
repay debts they suffered when the silver market collapsed nine 
years ago 
once texas billionaires nelson bunker and william herbert hunt 
are contesting some 150 million in taxes the internal revenue 
service says they owe from the partnerships dissolution in 1982 
a third brother lamar is contesting 500000 in taxes in a 
nonjury trial expected to last up to a month before us tax court 
judge jules g korner iii 
in a windowless room in us tax court filled with stacks of 
heavy boxes charts and a team of lawyers on both sides the 
brothers and their wives listened monday as the irs argued the 
partnership was a taxable financial arrangement to restructure debts 
from a silverbuying binge 
the partnership was created to provide financial relief to the 
petitioners at a time when they needed it very badly irs attorney 
deborah butler said in opening arguments 
but an attorney for the hunts claimed the partnership set up in 
an atmosphere of panic to repay debts after the silver price 
collapse in march 1980 was a legitimate business and not the 
colossal sham the irs claims 
the suggestion that 10 or 12 of the largest banks in the united 
states would knowingly participate in structuring such an elaborate 
sham must be viewed as farfetched said michael henke an 
attorney for bunker and herbert hunt 
the trial covers only 1982 but government attorneys say the 
outcome could affect other irs claims against bunker and herbert 
hunt in preceding and subsequent tax years 
those claims totaling 1 billion in taxes and interest exceed 
what the brothers say their assets are worth in us bankruptcy 
court documents filed in connection with their chapter 11 
reorganization 
and because the irs is a priority creditor in bankruptcy court 
the outcome of the tax trial could determine the size of hunt 
settlements with other bankruptcy court creditors 
lamar hunt is not in bankruptcy court 
in opening arguments monday henke said the hunts formed the 
partnership with placid oil co after a new jersey company 
threatened the familys flagship business founded in 1935 by their 
father legendary texas oil wildcatter hl hunt 
the hunts silver problems came to a head at the end of march 
1980 when bunker and herbert hunt were unable to come up with 434 
million to pay engelhard corp for silver they had agreed in 
january to purchase henke said 
henke said testimony would reveal the precious metals trader and 
chemical manufacturer threatened a lawsuit to pierce the six 
trusts owning placid to collect its debts 
under the disputed partnership agreement placid contributed cash 
and notes totaling 824 million obtained through a 11 billion 
loan from a consortium of banks 
the hunts contributed silver gold stocks coal properties and 
other assets that henke said had an aggregate gross value of more 
than 1 billion and a net contribution value of approximately 408 
million 
though henke claims the hunts contributed coal properties worth 
294 million in 1980 the irs claims those properties were worth 16 
million and when the partnership was dissolved the irs claims the 
coal properties were worth 6 million compared with hunt claims the 
coal properties were worth 262 million

the central intelligence agency says a defector 
from the soviet unions kgb is free to go if he doesnt like it here 
in a rare public statement the agency on monday denied it had 
mishandled the case of victor gundarev 49 former security chief of 
the soviet embassy in athens 
the cia said it welcomes an inquiry by the intelligence 
committees in congress into its handling of gundarev 
according to an article by david wise in the sunday new york 
times gundarev defected from the kgb in february 1986 
wise who has written extensively about the cia said gundarev 
wrote him i came to the conclusion after three years in usa 
that those people who would like to defect with the help of cia 
should think twice and was seeking an interview at the state 
department with soviet officials to discuss going home 
wise compared the case to that of vitaly yurchenko head of north 
american espionage for the kgb who defected in rome in 1985 
yurchenko retreated to the soviet embassy in washington less than 
three months later and held a specatular press conference to the 
embarrassment of the cia 
gundarev wrote wise has written cia director william webster 
that he and his wife and son were promised a normal way of life as 
free citizens in a democratic country but his belongings were 
searched his telephone tapped and his letters opened 
from the beginning they treated me as a dangle a false 
defector another yurchenko specially sent wise quoted gundarev 
as saying 
the cia statement said the allegation that the cia invades the 
privacy of individuals as described in the new york times article 
is false so too is the charge of mishandling 
the agency said it and the fbi had tried hard to smooth 
gundarevs transition to us residence had resettled him in an 
undisclosed location and had paid him a substantial amount of 
money for his information 
as with all individuals residing in this country legally mr 
gundarev is free to travel to any country he chooses the cia said 
wise said gundarevs information had proved less than topnotch 
in some instances john bothwell a former cia agent and submarine 
captain was arrested in britain on the basis of gundarevs report 
that bothwell was an agent he ran but charges against bothwell 
later were dropped

harold ezell was ousted as regional 
immigration commissioner monday saying his only regret was 
attending a party for deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos 
and his wife imelda 
in hindsight theres no way i would have gone to that 
reception knowing what i know today he told a news conference on 
his last day with the federal immigration and naturalization service 
although nothing happened that was illegal or immoral i regret 
the perception it created the ins outgoing western regional 
commissioner said of the august 1988 party in honolulu at which he 
was videotaped 
at the gathering ezell led partygoers in a prayer asking for the 
marcoses safe return to the philippines which would be against 
president corazon aquinos wishes and us policy 
asked what he knows now that he didnt know then he said we 
didnt know they were going to be indicted we would not have gone 
knowing that 
the marcoses were indicted on charges they plundered billions 
from the philippines 
ezell said however that he believed the incident had nothing to 
do with the acceptance of his resignation 
ezell who has served as western region commissioner since 1983 
said last month that he expected to be replaced after ins national 
commissioner alan nelson resigned 
he had submitted his resignation in march after george bush 
became president but said as late as may that he wanted to keep the 
job until late next year 
he acknowledged monday that he would have preferred to stay until 
november 1990 the end of the second phase of the immigration 
amnesty program as commissioner ezell coordinated the ins amnesty 
program in the western region where about half of the nearly 3 
million immigrants who applied for amnesty live 
ezell 52 headed a region that encompassed california nevada 
arizona hawaii and guam 
but while he was given good marks for the smooth operation of the 
program ezell often drew fire for remarks that some considered 
tasteless 
ezell said he suffered great pain from public perceptions of 
him as antihispanic an allegation he said was untrue 
if you speak out strongly the cheapest shot they can use is to 
say a person is anti one group or another he said 
ezell said he was proud of his accomplishments with the ins 
declaring we have served our country and our people the best 
way possible 
ezell said he would return to the private sector 
acting ins commissioner james buck named robert moschorak 
associate regional commissioner for operations in the western 
region to replace ezell temporarily

contributed to a 399 percent rise in serious crime when compared to 
the first half of 1988 
adolescent crime has risen 22 percent so far this year and 
unreported crime is growing at three or four times the rate of 
recorded crime he said 
unbalanced development in the economy politics social and 
moral spheres is inevitable in the transition period bakatin 
said this in turn provokes tension shortages social injustice 
and stimulates crime 
the united states spends 100 per capita on police whereas in 
the soviet union the figure is 12 he told the lawmakers 
bakatin spoke shortly before the 542member supreme soviet voted 
to retain him as interior minister a post he has held since october 
he was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 other 
officials appearing before the new legislature which has rejected 
several candidates for the supreme court and cabinet 
many soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because of 
an increase in murders muggings and rape shortages that have 
worsened steadily under economic reforms have created a demand for 
stolen goods that spurs on robbers 
gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiated 
since coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime 
at the confirmation hearing gorbachev said he had been impressed 
by the number of police he saw during a june 1216 visit to west 
germany 
he said he was told there is one policeman for every 400 germans 
bakatin said that in the soviet union there is one for every 588 
citizens 
the soviet union once kept crime statistics secret claiming 
socialism was free of crime rampant in the west 
a theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here was 
considered officially a rudiment of social antagonism from 
exploiting societies which should die as socialism developed 
bakatin said but it didnt 
meanwhile another government candidate up for legislative 
approval health minister yevgeny i chazov told legislators the 
health system is in the most severe crisis 
chazov who was confirmed said about 63 percent of the countrys 
hospitals and 59 percent of its clinics are in substandard 
buildings some 24 percent of hospitals have no sewage facilities 
and 15 percent lack running water 
chazov also said that the soviet union spends less money than any 
developed country on health care 32 percent of the soviet gross 
national product versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the united 
states

brush fires across the west on monday but flames still kept 
hundreds of people away from homes and campgrounds

alaska where weekend rain knocked down four big fires freeing up 
personnel and supplies 
finkelstein said that as of midmonday 44 fires burned 
uncontrolled covering about 167000 acres an increase of about 
50000 acres from sunday 
after a week of temperatures in the 90s and above over much of 
the west lower temperatures lighter wind or rain gave firefighters 
a break in parts of wyoming arizona and new mexico 
the weathers been real cooperative and thats been the real 
saving factor said kathy campbell of the malheur national forest 
in oregon where clouds and lighter wind helped contain a 3dayold 
blaze sunday 
but firefighters still had to contend with dry air and wind in 
utah idaho nebraska colorado and california southwestern texas 
also had no rain but higher humidity helped slow a 150acre fire in 
big bend national park 
some 200 evacuees were not allowed to return to their homes and 
an unknown number of people were evacuated monday in the path of a 
1900acre fire near sugarloaf mountain west of denver that

anasazi indian cliff dwellings was closed while six archaeologists 
traveled with fire crews to help save artifacts from a fire that had 
burned 2350 acres

canyons the archaeologists were along as advisers to ensure that no 
archaeological sites in fire areas atop the mesa were disturbed by 
the digging of fire breaks 
that part of the state got light rain sunday 
firefighters fought raging pockets of fire in nebraskas largest 
state park and tried to prevent the flames from heading west into 
more rugged terrain 
officials estimated it at 50000 or more acres over an area 22

rubble tweety and hundreds of other characters died monday 
following a lengthy hospital stay he was 81 
the creator of such classic cartoon trademarks as bugs bunnys 
eh whats up doc porky pigs thththththats all 
ffffolks and road runners beep beep died at 230 pm 
from complications of heart disease and other ailments at 
cedarssinai medical center said hospital spokesman ron wise 
he had been suffering from cardiac problems and emphysema when 
admitted may 19 
blanc performed the voices on 850 cartoons for warner bros in a 
career spanning more than 50 years his versatility was so profound 
that few would have presumed just one actor was behind so many 
markedly different characters he also performed voices on countless 
other cartoons such as the flintstones for hannabarbera and 
commercials and radio fillers 
in an interview last november he estimated he had done 900 
voices in all 
those voices were part of him and he loved every moment of 
it said his son noel when the kids would come to the door or 
in the studio he became those characters 
blanc made a car commercial on the day he went into the hospital 
and the last thing he said on the commerical the only thing he 
said was thats all folks and thats the last thing that was 
recorded on tape his son said 
the reservoir of hollywood legends is extremely low and mel 
blancs passing is a deep personal loss said longtime friend 
mickey rooney 
working decades before the advent of hightech sound effects 
blanc was a human synthesizer and a verbal computer it has been 
estimated that more than 20 million people hear his voices daily 
blanc had a magnificently versatile voice said robert a 
daly warners chairman and chief executive officer bugs bunny 
porky pig daffy duck sylvester the cat tweety and so many more 
they were all mel blanc 
besides warner bros blanc worked for other animated film 
makers playing the part of the hyperactive yammering dino fred 
flintstones pet dinosaur within the industry he was known as the 
man of a thousand voices 
blanc said he once tried to count all the cartoon voices he did 
while recuperating in 1961 from a nearfatal car accident he said 
he fell asleep shortly after passing the 400 mark 
blancs last cartoon contribution came with 1988s popular 
animationlive action film who framed roger rabbit in which he 
did the voices of daffy tweety bugs and sylvester he wrote an 
autobiography that year thats not all folks my life in the 
golden age of cartoons and radio

television series buck rogers in the 25th century

called happy rabbit was his favorite everybody knows who i am 
doc he said in the characters voice i dont cayuh where dey 
are who dey are even in mars dey know about me 
born in san francisco on may 30 1908 and raised in portland 
ore blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school 
he began his career in show business both as a musician and a 
radio perfomer he started in 1927 when he sang and performed on a 
portland radio show called the hoot owls 
he and his wife estelle rosenbaum subsequently wrote produced 
and performed all the characters for the daily radio show cobwebs 
and nuts 
in 1928 blanc who played the bass violin and sousaphone was 
hired by the nbc radio orchestra in san francisco 
starting in 1937 he became part of warner bros cartoon studio 
which produced one short feature subject each week 
his first warner bros character was a drunken bull in the looney 
tunes short picador porky as legend has it the actor playing 
porky pig in that short actually did stutter a few months later 
blanc took over the role in porkys duck hunt stuttering 
intact and created daffy duck at the same time 
blanc introduced bugs bunny in the 1940 short a wild hare 
giving the cartoon rabbit a combination bronx and brooklyn accent 
blanc invented the voices of such wellknown cartoon figures as 
woody woodpecker speedy gonzalez pepe le pew tasmanian devil 
road runner foghorn leghorn heathcliffe the cat speed buggy and 
yosemite sam 
he also did voices for mr spacely on the jetsons and the 
frito bandito in 1987 blanc performed in the daffy duck short 
the duxorcist marking the return of looney tunes movie shorts 
after a 20year absence he also worked on the 1988 short the 
night of the living duck which kicked off the new york film 
festival 
blanc said persistence paid off in landing the warner bros job 
frequent trips to the studio seeking an audition were met with 
constant rejection by the personnel manager 
that didnt stop me blanc said in a 1980 associated press 
interview i kept going back every two weeks and always got the 
same answer 
finally the guy died the man who took his place decided to 
give me a chance 
during warner bros cartoon film short heydey which lasted well 
into the 1950s few people in the united states recognized blancs 
face but hardly anyone was unfamiliar with his voices 
from sylvesters thufferin thuccotash to tweetys i tawt 
i taw a puddy tat blancs voice characterizations became 
household tidbits of us popular culture 
blanc called bugs his favorite character although he hated the 
taste of carrots he chewed for sound effects and spit the uneaten 
remains in the trash can 
but for all his fame as the voices of cartoon characters the 
most warner bros ever paid him for his vocal skills was 20000 
and the studio retained the rights to the phrases blanc invented 
in addition to working in animation he was a regular on radios 
the jack benny show playing professor leblanc bennys violin 
teacher and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of 
anaheim azusa and kookamunga 
blanc also played carmichael the bear sy the mexican gardener 
and made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 maxwell automobile 
owned by bennys skinflint comedy character 
he reprised many of the roles when benny moved to television 
he married miss rosenbaum in 1933 their son noel was born five 
years later blanc once said the only person who can imitate his 
repertoire of cartoon voices was his son 
blanc is survived by his wife and son funeral arrangements were

just when people thought it was safe 
to go near a city parks pond word comes that two piranhas caught 
there were male and female 
there could be eggs said jared dow who along with his 
friend jason kraus both 16 hooked the second of the piranhas 
sunday night from alice keck park memorial gardens pond 
park officials though are keeping their fingers crossed that 
nothing fishy was going on between the piranhas 
chances are they hadnt been acclimated to the pond where they 
were reproducing said park superintendent jeff cope hopefully 
weve closed this chapter 
the story began earlier this month when people noticed that some 
of the shallow ponds fish and turtles had been viciously attacked 
two piranhas were spotted 
the pond in the center of the city is a popular dumping ground 
for unwanted fish 
the first piranha a female was caught friday by park officials 
fishing with liver as bait the second eluded capture officials 
tried everything including electronic shock equipment 
fishermen meanwhile lined the pond until late at night to the 
dismay of parks officials who said the fishermen were harming fish 
and other wildlife 
among the outlaw anglers were dow and kraus who hooked the 
16inch 2pound male fugitive sunday night with liver bait 
i thought it was a bass because it was jumping out of the water 
at first said dow a gas station attendant then we saw the 
teeth the teeth on this one were a quarterinch long 
dow kept the fish in an aquarium overnight and hauled it monday 
in a waterfilled ice chest to the city park department for positive 
identification since dow cooperated no citations were issued for 
illegal fishing 
they just told me not to do it again he said 
the fish was taken to a taxidermist for stuffing and will be 
mounted next to its partner in the departments offices

pollutants from burning coal could be cut by 
more than half at older power plants linked to acid rain according 
to a study 
the study was produced monday by the energy department as part of 
a 5 billion program with private industry to develop clean coal 
technologies 
a draft analysis of the environment effects of the new 
technologies concludes that they could reduce national emissions of 
sulfur dioxide from existing coal plants by as much as 45 percent by 
the year 2010 the study said nitrogen oxide emissions could be cut 
by as much as 33 percent over the same period 
both are precursors of the acids that form and fall as acid rain 
when smokestack gases are carried long distances by the wind

donated apples may contain traces of alar but 
still will be safe according to the agriculture department 
the usda announced last week it would spend up to 15 million in 
an effort to help reduce a huge surplus of apples created when 
consumers stopped buying amid fears over the use of alar the plan 
was for the usda to give the apples to schools prisons public 
assistance food programs and others 
but the usda now says growers will donate the apples to various 
groups and then be reimbursed 
the industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of 
apples from last years crop valued at between 40 million and 56 
million remain unsold with this years harvest only weeks away 
alar is used to enhance apple color ease of harvesting and life 
in storage 
the controversy began in late february when a private 
environmental advocacy group the natural resources defense council 
said eating apples treated with the chemical substantially increases 
the risk of cancer in children the environmental protection agency 
and the food and drug administration disputed the report as a major 
exaggeration of the risk

after a trip back to the drawing board the 
securities and exchange commission is again proposing a rules change 
that would make it easier for corporations to raise capital through 
the private sale of securities 
the commission voted 50 monday to seek another round of public 
comment on revisions to its controversial proposal to eliminate some 
restrictions on the resale of securities offered privately 
the rule would create what the sec terms a safe harbor from 
registration and disclosure rules for the resale of privately 
offered securities to big institutional investors 
supporters of the change say it would lower financing costs for 
companies and would attract foreign companies to raise capital in 
the united states but critics claim it would increase the power of 
large institutional investors such as banks and insurance 
companies while cutting into the business of stock exchanges

the stifling desert heat radiates from the 
sidewalk outside the tropicana hotel where the band that for years 
provided the music now walks a picket line to protest its 
replacement taped music 
inside the lavish resort singers lipsync and dancers kick their 
legs to recorded music during the popular folies bergere shows 
twicenightly performances 
musicians are locked in a fight for survival at the tropicana and 
two other strip resorts where costconscious managers also want to 
replace live music in production shows 
the musicians ultimately make the product that puts musicians 
out of work lamented mark tully massagli leader of musicians 
union local 369 think of the irony of that 
the conversion to tape now affects about 45 fulltime musicians 
but it has raised passions among many more who feel spontaneous 
entertainment is being sold out by gaming corporations 
we cant have this town which was built on live entertainment 
go the other way said singer sammy davis jr dont let them 
do this to us 
davis and a few other big name entertainers gathered recently to 
back the musicians 
if we lose live music in this town weve got serious 
problems said comedian jerry lewis 
lewis and davis were appearing together at ballys which plans 
to replace the 19 musicians backing its jubilee production show with 
taped music but keep live musicians in its main showroom 
hotel officials say musicians are an expensive luxury not found 
in atlantic city nj hotels which allow taped music and 
synthesizers in place of live performances 
were not doing away with musicians in the celebrity room 
said robert ostrovsky a ballys executive but we feel taped 
music is appropriate for productiontype showrooms 
the 14 union musicians who backed the folies bergere show at the 
tropicana walked off their jobs june 3 upset over the hotels 
unwillingness to budge on the issue the show was closed while a 
tape was prepared and reopened june 25 to what hotel officials say 
are increasingly full audiences 
were doing very well with it said hotel spokesman ira david 
sternberg 
musicians at ballys and the flamingo hilton meanwhile have 
stayed on the job despite the refusal of the hotels to increase 
their offer of two to four musicians at each hotel on the payroll 
and severance pay to the others 
officials at the three resorts sent letters to the musicians last 
week informing them they would not be needed further when they 
implement their final offer on july 26 and go to taped music 
perhaps more ominous however to the estimated 250 musicians who 
make a living in the hotels is a plan by the resorts to pay 
musicians only for the shows they actually perform 
many entertainers bring their own bands to las vegas limiting 
work for the las vegas musicians 
under the contract that expired june 1 musicians were guaranteed 
their 65471 a week salary for at least 38 weeks a year 
the pickets have tried to rally support by warning that musicians 
who fill the citys symphony and small jazz bands may be forced to 
leave town to find work leaving a cultural void in the city 
they also took out a 12000 ad in the los angeles times warning 
tourists of the strike 
and the union has won a few victories in negotiations massagli 
said the stardust hotel has agreed to a contract keeping musicians 
at its longrunning lido de paris show and the union plaza has 
agreed to live music at its smaller production show 
but the major strip resorts usually set the trend and that is 
where the musicians believe may be their last stand 
our entire future is at stake here massagli said this is 
for our very survival

nuon chea who for years held the no 2 
spot in the khmer rouge power hierarchy in cambodia has asked to 
retire a radio report said 
the clandestine khmer rouge radio on sunday quoted a letter from 
nuon chea to khmer rouge leader khieu samphan saying he wished to 
retire once vietnamese troops pull out of cambodia a transcript of 
the report was seen today 
nuon chea 63 was among the small circle of communist 
revolutionaries who brutalized cambodia during their 197578 rule 
when hundreds of thousands of people died from khmer rouge 
executions famine and civil unrest 
a vietnamese invasion ousted the khmer rouge from power and the 
movement has since waged guerrilla war from bases along the 
thaicambodian border 
in june khmer rouge leader pol pot asked to resign from his last 
official post but western analysts were skeptical that he had really 
called it quits 
negotiations on a cambodian peace settlement have focused on the 
need to remove pol pot and other of its top leaders before allowing 
the khmer rouge it to share power with the vietnameseinstalled 
government in phnom penh and the noncommunist groups with whom it 
has forged a loose resistance coalition 
nuon chea formally held the no 2 position after pol pot and 
briefly replaced the latter as prime minister in 1976 
others in this inner circle which continues to dominate the 
khmer rouge were ieng sary son sen ta mok khieu samphan and the 
wives of pol pot ieng sary and son sen 
nuon chea reportedly continued to have a key role after the khmer 
rouge ouster from phnom penh although little is known about the 
inner workings of the secretive leadership

retirement age of 60 in 1986 but had continued to take part in the 
resistance struggle to fight the hanoi vietnamese for national 
liberation

the weber family managed to carry a few 
armloads of possessions to three waiting cars before turning to 
watch their boulder canyon home go up in flames 
the fire was so intense it just engulfed the house said 
brian weber 18 
weber had tried to protect the house by clearing a 60foot swathe 
around it with a chainsaw 
he tried spraying the house with a garden hose and draping it 
with wet blankets 
nothing worked 
we got the tv and the computer the expensive stuff said his 
mother laurette weber 45 what we got out the door in about 10 
minutes is all 
we didnt get any pictures heirlooms or anything like that 
we got the clothes on our back 
the webers interviewed monday in the lobby of a shelter at 
fairview high school were among more than 40 families displaced by 
the massive fire near sugarloaf mountain about 10 miles west of 
boulder in northcentral colorado 
alexia sokolov said she barely got out of her home alive 
first i smelled smoke and then i saw the flames she said 
still coughing 
i was thinking i had more time than i did she said its 
really strange to think very quickly what you want out of 35 years 
of your life 
in addition to their home the webers lost eight sheep eight 
goats and a pickup truck they are unsure if their chickens survived 
the fire they did save their two dogs and at least two of their

volunteer fire department jacket laurette weber said she her 
husband and their two sons will rebuild their home which was 
uninsured 
if the foundations good well start there she said if

spared so far but it could go 
she added i told my husband i never did like the style of that 
kitchen it gives me a chance to redo it

the prosecution was given more time to prepare to 
crossexamine edwin meese iii after the former us attorney general 
testified that longtime friend e robert wallach never sought favors 
for the wedtech corp 
meese took the stand at wallachs racketeering trial in federal 
court monday 
meese who resigned as attorney general in july 1988 was faulted 
in an internal justice department report released in january for his 
efforts to help wallach in an illfated mideast oil pipeline 
proposal and to assist him with wedtech 
the departments office of professional responsibility found 
meese had violated internal departmental standards of conduct and an 
executive order on ethics 
meese has never been charged with any crimes in connection with 
the wedtech case 
assistant us attorney baruch weisss crossexamination of meese 
was put off until thursday after weiss complained to us district 
judge richard owen that he didnt know about meeses appearance 
until 1030 pm sunday and needed more 
during his hourlong testimony meese appeared relaxed 
did mr wallach ask you to intervene in any way shape or form 
in the wedtech investigation asked wallachs attorney gary 
neftalis 
no absolutely not meese said 
did you intervene in any way in the wedtech investigation 
neftalis asked 
no i did not in any way he replied 
wedtech now defunct was a small south bronx machine shop that 
grew into a 100 million defense contractor through a small business 
administration program that set aside contracts without competitive 
bidding for minoritycontrolled companies 
evidence at earlier trials has shown that wedtech continued to 
receive the nobid contracts through bribes even after it ceased to 
be minorityowned 
wallach w franklyn chinn 47 a former wedtech board member and 
onetime meese financial adviser and a business associate of theirs 
r kent london are charged in a 21count racketeering indictment 
with extracting almost 2 million in illegal payoffs and payments 
from wedtech including some 525000 in alleged bribes to wallach 
to influence meese and other government officials 
meese said wallach 55 told him in 1981 when meese was a 
highranking adviser to president reagan that wedtech would be a 
good company for the administration to spotlight in its proposals 
for urban enterprise zones 
wallach also told him about the companys efforts in 1981 to 
secure an army contract to build small engines meese said wallach 
said company officials felt they were not being treated fairly by 
the army 
meese said he passed on the problem of the army contract to his 
staff who referred the matter to the office of cabinet affairs at 
the white house he said he had received probably dozens of 
similar complaints during his time at the white house he said he 
did nothing further

more than 9000 dockworkers went on strike 
nationwide today and half a million municipal employees began a 
twoday walkout the latest in a sudden burst of british labor 
unrest 
subway and railroad workers meanwhile threatened to hold 
another oneday strike on wednesday it would be the fourth such 
walkout in four weeks 
but rail workers also agreed monday to hold their first direct 
negotiations since may raising hopes of a possible settlement in 
the chronic transit dispute that has periodically forced millions to 
seek alternate transportation 
about 9400 dockworkers at 60 ports went on strike at midnight 
monday to protest the decision by prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government to scrap a 1947 law guaranteeing dockworkers 
jobs for life 
the law was enacted because of widespread labor abuses at the 
docks during that time mrs thatchers government which has curbed 
many union powers in the 10 years she has been in power argued that 
such a guarantee is outdated 
the national association of port employers predicted the strike 
would fail the 60 ports affected handle just 43 percent of shipping 
traffic with the rest going through britains other 102 ports many 
of the 102 have been developed since 1947 and were never covered by 
the lifetime job guarantee 
many shippers have arranged for cargoes to be transferred from 
the 60 ports affected by the strike to other ports 
but ron todd general secretary of the 13 millionmember 
transport and general workers union to which the striking dockers 
belong said lets see what they the port employers say at the 
end of the first month or the second month or the third month of the 
strike 
the 48hour strike by more than 500000 members of the national 
association of local government officers is part of a series of 
protest strikes this year to demand higher wages the walkouts have 
disrupted municipal services ranging from library services to 
garbage collection 
unions say a major cause of this summers labor unrest is 
inflation eating into wages britains annual rate of inflation now 
stands at 83 percent the highest it has been in seven years 
in other labor disputes this summer strikes have regularly 
closed passport offices halted london bus services and caused 
cancellation of news and current affairs programs on british 
broadcasting corp television and radio 
railroad and subway workers both planned oneday walkouts 
wednesday to demand higher wages 
but hopes for an end to the rail dispute surfaced on monday when 
rail unions oficials agreed to meet today with british rail the 
board that runs the stateowned network it would be the first 
direct talks since early may 
the series of 24hour strikes called by the 117000member 
national union of railwaymen have completely shut down the network 
each wednesday since june 14 
on monday in a separate move the 17500 train drivers of 
another union the associated society of locomotive engineers and 
firemen began an indefinite overtime ban severely disrupting 
services on a daytoday basis

not specifically refer to mondays episodes 
too often miners have been the recipients of violence he 
said

at a barren desert highway intersection 
an informal gathering of aviation buffs celebrated the b2 stealth 
bombers first power tests with foaming beer and a rally round the 
american flag 
for weeks an assortment of people fascinated with the allwing 
radarevading bomber from northrop corp have been turning up around 
sunrise waiting in expectation of a glimpse of the costliest 
warplane in history 
monday they were satisfied when the approximately 500 
millionacopy b2 rolled ponderously from its secure hangar and 
taxied down the air force plant 42 runway at about 100 mph 
it was an awesome sight to see said hot dog vendor norm 
masten as he offered up a breakfast frank and sauerkraut to a b2 
watcher if i were an enemy of this country and i saw that i would 
be shaking in my boots 
the sleek mantashaped strategic bomber successfully conducted 
taxi and engine tests for the first time and in public view 
stopping traffic on sierra highway the main desert thoroughfare 
alongside air force plant 42 
air force officials say more ground tests will be conducted this 
week and first flight within the next two weeks 
people at the intersection drank beer sipped soft drinks and 
munched brooklyn hot dogs with coney island onion sauce ladled out 
by vendor masten from his little new yorker hot dog franchise a 
large american flag whipped in the breeze from above the trailer as 
masten fixed franks and dug deep for mustard sauerkraut and pickles 
masten was doing a landoffice business at the corner of sierra 
highway and avenue n an hour after the test motorists were still 
stopping to investigate the commotion where rarely anyone stirs 
among the spiny joshua trees and desert sagebrush 
hundreds gathered at various times wheeling in with motor homes 
sports cars and harleydavidson motorcycles 
chief among the watchers was retired marine john macwhirter who 
had been out on the highway before dawn each morning for two weeks 
for a glimpse of the stealth from his yellow stepvan which was 
decorated with patriotic slogans peppered with salty observations 
about actress jane fonda and iran 
it looked like a volkswagen with wings macwhirter declared 
happily adjusting his red usmc baseball cap it looks like buck 
rogers it looks like flash gordon i wouldnt have any anxiety at 
all about it flying tomorrow 
cars stopped for about a mile along the highway so people could 
gawk at the strange sight of the bomber in the bright desert 
sunshine 
jake brown a rangy navy boatswains mate formerly assigned to the 
battleship uss new jersey said that when he heard the stealth was 
emerging from its hangar he telephoned work to say hed be late 
i called my boss and boogied said brown who arrived at the 
areas favorite aircraftwatching corner just in time to see the 
vshaped bomber enter the taxi way and get up to speed 
were into airplanes out here brown declared as he gazed at 
familiar skies where planes such as the b1 the u2 and the sr71 
blackbird often conduct tests 
the stealth is the nations most expensive and controversial 
coming into the pentagon arsenal during a period of increasing 
budget cuts 
although many congressional critics have argued that the plane is 
either unnecessary or too expensive at a 70 billion program cost 
secretary of defense dick cheney has declared the stealth bomber a 
linchpin of americas strategic defense policy

president bush in a dramatic windup to his 
trip to poland flew to the birthplace of solidarity today for talks 
with lech walesa and his independent trade union allies who sparked 
a political upheaval in this communist nation 
bush and his wife barbara arrived from warsaw where the 
president unveiled a modest aid program for poland on monday the 
first day of a 10day european tour that will include an economic 
summit of seven industrial democracies in paris later this week 
bush may come under pressure from walesa for a 10 billion 
package of western credits and investment guarantees for the 
beleaguered country 
bush has ruled out anything that large and secretary of state 
james a baker iii said monday no one really expected the president 
to show up here with a big wheelbarrow full of dollars 
after a day of talks monday largely with government leaders in 
warsaw bush was meeting walesa in the baltic sea city of gdansk 
from there bush was traveling to budapest hungary for another 
twoday stay 
bush has been a longtime backer of solidarity and if he was to 
attract big crowds anywhere in poland gdansk was the place 
after a luncheon at the house walesa shares with his wife danuta 
and their eight children at 54 polanki street bush was accompanying 
the union leader to the towering solidarity workers monument outside 
the lenin shipyards 
walesa in an interview monday said poland is making progress 
with its political freedoms faster than it is tackling its economic 
problems 
he said he wants bush to help us make this correction so that 
financial matters are addressed with the same emphasis as political 
affairs 
crowned by three crosses topped with anchors the solidarity 
monument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed by 
government security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices that 
left 45 dead and 2000 injured 
to drum up a big audience solidarity workers distributed 
leaflets about bushs visit and his speech at the monument 
in warsaw bush drew crowds that were relatively small numbering 
no more than 3000 people at any site 
even so baker said bush was not disappointed its not some 
election campaign where weve gone out here and tried to turn out 
crowds he said 
the president spent more than two hours in talks monday with 
communist party leader wojciech jaruzelski and then met with him 
again over lunch and again at a state dinner 
solidarity representatives also attended the luncheon and one of 
them bronislaw geremek the union leader in the house got the seat 
of honor at the head table next to bush jaruzelski sat at a 
separate table with the presidents wife barbara 
as the presidents motorcade arrived at radziwill palace for the 
dinner demonstrators among 1000 people outside could be heard 
shouting down with communism and jaruzelski must go 
there was no indication whether bush could hear the protests 
which appeared to have been staged by splinter opposition groups 
in a toast to bush jaruzelski said may our relations always 
feature mutual respect confidence and friendly feelings 
interviewed later on abc news jaruzelski said he spoke with 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev about the meeting and added that 
bushs visit was positive for future relations 
i really am heartened that the leaders of the two big powers 
are guided by the same intentions and i feel that this bodes well 
for the future jaruzelski said 
the general who imposed martial law in 1981 to crush solidarity 
and imprison its leaders said union representatives now share 
responsibility with the government for polands destiny its 
wellbeing its position in europe and in the world 
solidarity representatives won nearly half the seats in recent 
parliamentary elections and walesa has not ruled out the 
possibility of running for the new powerful post of president 
in his toast bush repeated the theme of encouraging political 
and economic reforms while cautioning that poles face a period of 
economic belttightening 
reform is a difficult process as you well know bush said at 
the dinner there are neither easy answers nor costfree 
solutions but there is a sound basis for hope 
and today you have the goodwill of an expectant and hopeful 
world he said 
in an address to parliament bush said he would ask congress to 
create a 100 million fund to help encourage development of the 
private sector in poland he also said he would ask for 15 million 
to fight pollution in the city of krakow 
bush said he will ask leaders of six other industrialized nations 
attending a summit with him in paris late this week to support 
rescheduling up to 5 billion of polands 39 billion international 
debt

a judge dismissed child molestation 
charges against a man whose conviction in the case was overturned by 
the us supreme court because he was not allowed to face his 
accusers in court 
judge ch pelton on monday dismissed charges against jon avery 
coy 38 on the recommendation of a prosecutor who cited the 
reluctance of two girls to testify and the weakening of physical 
evidence the new trial was to have begun monday 
coy was convicted in 1985 of two counts of lascivious acts with a 
child for allegedly entering a makeshift tent where two 13yearold 
girls were camping and forcing them to perform sexual acts with him 
coys attorney john j wolfe appealed on the grounds coy was 
denied his constitutional right to confront his accusers 
when the case was first tried a oneway screen was used to keep 
the girls from seeing coy while they testified 
the us supreme court voted 62 in 1988 to overturn the 
conviction agreeing that coy had been denied the right to confront 
his accusers the court returned the case for a new trial 
following the dismissal coy said i still maintain that i was 
not the man they were looking for 
he has been living in pennsylvania since his release 
im glad its over coy said its caused me a lot of 
heartache 
clinton county attorney larry schultz who entered the motion to 
dismiss the case said although his office had worked with the girls 
for several months they were reluctant to testify 
the victims believe that their identities are generally unknown 
at this time and that they will if the trial proceeds become the 
subject of some curiosity and have their lives become the subject of 
some public scrutiny schultz said 
the victims are now 17 years old they have spent the past four 
years attempting to put the tragedy of august 1985 behind them 
schultz said 
he said the request for expanded media coverage made by two 
television stations added to the states decision the request would 
have allowed cameras to film part of the trial although not the 
girls testimony 
the death of clinton police sgt lyle smith made the states job 
more difficult prosecutors said the motion said smiths testimony 
was critical in establishing the location of certain physical 
evidence against coy 
the state also discovered that hair specimens located at the 
scene have disappeared since the trial 
in the trial the girls testified they could not see the face of 
their attacker because he wore a mask and shined a flashlight in 
their eyes 
according to testimony coys fingerprints were found on the 
flashlight

secretary of housing and urban development jack 
f kemp has asked congress to repeal a new law that protects the 
families of drug dealers against eviction from public housing the 
new york times reported today 
the law jeopardizes huds efforts to simplify evicting the actual 
drug dealers by making it harder for a housing authority to evict 
a tenant for drugrelated criminal activity than for nonpayment of 
rent or other violations of the tenant lease kemp wrote to 
members of the house and senate appropriations committees 
the law poses a significant setback to our efforts to establish 
drugfree public housing the letter said 
the law was attached to a spending bill that was passed hurriedly 
last month in time for the independence day holiday it took effect 
june 30 when president bush signed the spending bill 
congressional leaders said most members did not even realize they 
had voted to require housing authorities to make sure that evictions 
of drug dealers did not affect innocent members of the same 
household the times said 
the chances for reversal are excellent said rep bob 
traxler dmich chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee 
on hud and independent agencies 
the eviction provision apparently was agreed to in negotiations 
between rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house 
banking committee and sen harry reid dnev a member of the 
senate appropriations committee the times said 
the newspaper quoted unidentified congressional aides as saying 
gonzalez had been concerned that the streamlined eviction process 
for drug dealers might penalize innocent people

romania is making military threats 
against hungary and soon could become a threat to the security of 
its soviet bloc neighbor hungarys foreign minister says 
the allegation was the latest sign of worsening relations between 
the countries whose leaders met informally saturday to discuss 
their differences but apparently only worsened the huge rift between 
them 
foreign minister gyula horn speaking at a news conference in 
advance of president bushs visit today to hungary said romanian 
media had carried certain military types of threats against 
hungary 
horn refused to be more specific romanian military publications 
have reportedly devoted considerable space recently to deteriorating 
romanianhungarian relations 
horn also implied that romania might one day threaten nuclear 
action 
he said that if a nations leaders claim they are capable of 
producing nuclear weapons and that in the nottoodistant future 
they will start on the manufacture of mediumrange missiles this 
will have an impact on the neighboring nation in this case 
hungary 
in april president nicolae ceausescu of romania said his country 
has the potential to make nuclear weapons 
ceausescu and rezso nyers chairman of the hungarian communist 
party were involved in a very sharp round of talks on saturday 
in bucharest where the leaders had gathered to attend a warsaw pact 
summit horn said 
horn had said saturday after he attended that meeting that 
relations between the two nations were now at a bottom point 
we took stock of all problems affecting our relations and the 
only area where agreement was reached was that we are neighbors and 
better relations are in our mutual interest horn had said after 
the meeting 
horn was quoted saturday by the staterun hungarian news agency 
mti as saying that the emergence of certain military threats in 
recent months also affect heavily our relations we see such 
manifestations as if the romanians were deliberately attempting to 
incite hostility 
however on monday horn said we do not want to overdramatize 
this but we cannot let it pass either 
the nations have been engaged in an escalating war of words over 
hungarys allegations that romania is mistreating its 17 
millionmember ethnic hungarian minority 
hungary also is strongly opposed to a romanian rural resettlement 
plan that it says could destroy ethnic culture and tradition by 
moving hungarians out of their native villages thousands of which 
are being razed 
relations have been further worsened by hungarys decision more 
than one year ago to accept refugees from romania about 30000 
people have since fled to hungary most of them ethnic hungarians 
romanian media have increasingly charged that hungary is seeking 
to reverse the borders established by the 1920 treaty of trianon 
which granted romania the territory of transylvania 
most of the ethnic hungarians live there for centuries the area 
was ruled by hungary 
however horn quoted an unidentified romanian general as having 
described the trianon treaty as unjust because hungary still retains 
territories inhabited by romanians about 20000 ethnic romanians 
live in hungary mostly in its southeast 
horn also said monday that ceausescu had ruled out a factfinding 
mission to romania by an impartial international delegation but 
confirmed that a lowlevel hungarian delegation could visit romania 
he said the hungarian side at the talks asked that the delegation 
be allowed to study the villagerazing scheme but that ceausescu 
said the romanians would determine the delegations itinerary 
horn also said hungary was prepared to hold a meeting of the two 
premiers but only if we can discuss all of the problems and 
achieve some kind of agreement on their solutions 
the hungarian foreign minister told reporters that no third 
country including the soviet union had been asked to help improve 
relations between the countries 
referring to bushs visit horn said officials hope to give the 
president a realistic picture of our countrys politics and 
economy 
hungary has embraced political and economic reform and closer 
ties to the west while romania has maintained hardline adherence 
to communism

a car thief probably didnt envision he would 
become a good samaritan by stealing a dilapidated convertible then 
fixing it up and painting it 
the owners of the classic 1976 volkswagen recovered it more than 
three months after it was stolen from a parking lot outside their 
north dallas apartment but charlie and sharon reed hardly 
recognized their beloved bugaloo 
the banana yellow vw had undergone about 1200 worth of repairs 
including new bumpers and fenders and other improvements police in 
corsicana 45 miles southeast of dallas called the reeds on 
saturday after the car was found at a used car lot there 
i think they aligned the front end too reed said of the 
thieves 
it used to shimmy real bad the only thing they didnt replace 
is this rubber strip on the back bumper shouldnt be 10 15 
dollars 
the 25yearold reed who sells rebuilt auto engines said the 
only item missing was a toolbox his motherinlaw had given him at 
christmas 
its unbelievable said sharon reed a 23yearold 
receptionist at a dallas bank who added she thought the convertible 
had been lost forever 
mark i barnes owner of bampd motors in corsicana said he had no 
idea the bug was hot when he bought it for 2000 he said he 
installed a 100 windshield but did not repair the bumpers or 
fenders or repaint the car 
he was asking for 3200 for the car 
police are seeking the man who sold the car to barnes

a federal appeals court reinstated damage 
suits accusing former dictator ferdinand marcos of ordering the 
imprisonment and torture of numerous philippine citizens 
the suits had been dismissed by federal judges in hawaii and 
california on the grounds that marcos actions were acts of 
state immune from lawsuit under a doctrine that courts in one 
nation cannot judge the sovereign acts of another 
but the 9th us court of appeals ruled last year that the act 
of state doctrine did not protect a deposed ruler like marcos 
because the doctrines main purpose is to avoid entangling the 
courts in delicate foreign policy questions 
that ruling revived a suit by the current philippine government 
headed by president corazon aquino which accuses marcos of looting 
the philippines during his 20year rule and hiding his wealth abroad 
on monday the court cited the same ruling in ordering the 
private damage suits reinstated 
the issues raised although extraordinarily complex are within 
the capacity of the courts to resolve the threejudge panel said 
marcos who fled a popular uprising in the philippines in 
february 1986 lives in hawaii and has been hospitalized with a 
grave illness since january 
mondays ruling involved five lawsuits three in honolulu and two 
in san francisco that included accusations of illegal arrest 
torture and other abuse

a taiwanese journalist freed and deported from 
china today after being held eight days said chinese authorities 
told him they arrested a key student leader from the crushed 
prodemocracy movement 
the whereabouts of the student leader wang dan have been 
unknown since he met with the journalist huang tehpei in beijing 
on july 2 there had been unconfirmed reports of his arrest 
huang a reporter for taiwans independence evening post told 
reporters in hong kong that officials of the beijing municipal state 
security bureau informed him of wangs arrest after huang himself 
was detained on july 3 
they told me tell the truth because everyone else has been 
caught your friend wang dan and your driver huang said 
huang said he had met wang to discuss the dissidents options for 
fleeing china but the two split up when they realized they were 
being followed by security agentshuangs driver and wang stayed 
together and were chased by the agents he said 
huang also said interrogators confronted him with information 
only he and his driver would know leading him to believe that wang 
had been arrested 
its very possible its because of me that the student leader 
was caught he said 
huang was freed on account of his good attitude in admitting 
his guilt chinas official xinhua news agency quoted a spokesman 
for the municipal state security bureau as saying 
xinhua said chinese authorities also considered the overall 
interest of the relations between the two sides of the taiwan 
strait 
huang was charged with violating martial law regulations that ban 
foreign hong kong and taiwanese journalists from reporting on the 
political turmoil in beijing 
xinhua said he concocted rumors filed news stories designed to 
instigate turmoil and counterrevolutionary revolt and drew maps of 
the deployment of martial law enforcement troops 
xinhua also said huang who arrived in beijing in june with a 
tourist visa made secret contacts july 2 with a leader of the 
illegal autonomous student union of beijing universities and planned 
to assist the student in fleeing the mainland it did not name the 
student who was presumed to be wang 
since the government crackdown began last month some leaders of 
the prodemocracy movement have escaped to the west to avoid arrest 
others have been arrested and still others are in hiding 
huang said that throughout his captivity interrogators demanded 
that he confess to breaking the law he said he acknowledged most 
allegations but refused to comply when authorities wanted me to 
say i was a spy 
he said he was handcuffed and forced into a car but added 
there was no corporal punishment they did not hit me 
huang said he would remain in hong kong until another reporter 
from his newspaper hsu lu left beijing taiwan radio said chinese 
security informed miss hsu early today to leave the country within 
48 hours 
the rival nationalist government on taiwan bans all official 
contacts with the mainland but in the past two years has relaxed 
restrictions on travel and visits by sports delegations and other 
nongovernmental groups 
lee chinghua secretary general of taiwans olympic committee 
said monday he had received a cable from his counterpart in china 
promising an early release for huang because we cherish the easing 
of tension across the taiwan straits and have fully considered the 
wishes of taiwans leaders 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed june 34 when troops 
ran protesters out of central beijing crushing the studentled 
prodemocracy movement

a government spokesman today said ousted communist 
party chief zhao ziyang is still under investigation for allegedly 
supporting the prodemocracy movement and refused to rule out that 
he might be put on trial 
yuan mu the only highranking government official who has met 
with reporters since the army crushed the movement june 34 told a 
news conference that at this stage zhao only was accused of 
making mistakes that could be dealt with within the party 
however the problem is still under investigation yuan said 
how the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided 
according to the findings of the investigation 
in other developments an american reporter and a taiwanese 
journalist left china after being ordered out and authorities gave 
a second taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave all were accused of 
violating restrictions on reporting 
the new party chief jiang zemin met with a group of hong kong 
leaders this afternoon but both sides refused comment on the 
discussions 
jiang was expected to try to reassure hong kong residents 
frightened by the mainland crackdown that china would preserve their 
capitalist system for 50 years after britain returns the colony in 
1997 however china also has called on hong kong to stop supporting 
fugitive prodemocracy activists 
when the party central committee ousted zhao on june 24 from the 
post he held for more than two years it accused him of splitting 
the party and supporting the studentled protests for a freer 
society 
however beijing mayor chen xitong charged in a recently 
disclosed major speech that zhao connived at and facilitated the 
gradual escalation of the protests from april to june and that his 
aides collaborated with the students in efforts to overthrow the 
government 
the report stopped just short of accusing zhao of taking part in 
the alleged coup conspiracy by those under him such a charge would 
have to be followed by a trial which might force party leaders to 
reveal details of toplevel decisionmaking and might arouse new 
antiparty sentiment 
although zhao did not enjoy wide personal popularity he has 
become a symbol of the crushed reformist camp 
only senior leader deng xiaoping who once sponsored zhaos rise 
to power could make the crucial decision of putting him on trial 
the last time a top official was accused of plotting a coup in 
china was in 1976 when moderates and generals arrested the radical 
gang of four that led the cultural revolution they were put on 
public trial in 1980 and are serving life sentences 
recent official media reports also have accused zhao of serious 
ideological mistakes including deemphasizing the role of the 
proletariat and neglecting party building 
at his news conference yuan blamed zhao for the endemic 
corruption within party ranks saying that under his leadership the 
fight against corruption was relaxed 
yuan said martial law imposed in central beijing on may 20 
could not be lifted yet because the struggle has not ended some 
guns still remain in society and that will be a cause of further 
unrest 
he insisted however that foreign tourists and businessmen could 
consider beijing secure and said it would be unwise to make lifting 
of martial law a condition for returning to the city 
thousands of chinesebased foreign businessmen and their families 
fled beijing in the week after the army cleared central beijing of 
protesters killing hundreds most have yet to return 
many joint venture companies which provide capital and 
technology china needs badly to modernize remain virtually shut 
down or operate at much reduced levels 
of course there will be a time limit for martial law but even 
i cant say exactly when that will be yuan said he said it would 
be lifted when things have completely returned to normal and when 
we feel that all the problems of the rebellion that need to be 
resolved have been 
he said sanctions imposed by some western countries to protest 
the crackdown will cause some temporary trouble for chinas 
ailing economy among the problems are inflation that yuan said was 
running at 255 percent in the first half of the year and growing 
budget and trade deficits 
but the chinese people will not yield to these pressures 
because of these troubles he said on the contrary it will 
inspire a spirit of plain living and hard struggle and relying on 
our own efforts so in the long run it will do our country good 
yuan refused to disclose figures for the number of people 
arrested since the crackdown began the associated press has counted 
more than 2000 arrests nationwide according to official media 
reports but chinese sources said that many were believed to have 
been arrested in the capital alone 
china today expelled a taiwanese reporter who was arrested a week 
ago after he reported meeting with a key fugitive student leader 
huang tehpei of the independence evening post said after 
arriving in hong kong that authorities told him they had arrested 
the student wang dan 
the ministry of state security ordered a second independence 
evening post reporter hsu lu to leave within 48 hours the 
peoples broadcasting station said it said she was accused of 
violating martial law conducting illegal interviews and filing 
distorted reports 
a reporter for the usrun voice of america mark hopkins also 
flew to hong kong today after being accused of violating martial 
law he was the second voa reporter and the seventh western reporter 
ordered out since the crackdown

the defense rested its case in the night 
stalker mass murder trial after presenting a photograph of 
defendant richard ramirez that they say proves he couldnt have 
committed two of the attacks 
the string of slayings terrorized southern california four years 
ago 
ramirezs lawyers entered into evidence monday a blownup color 
photograph of ramirez they say is evidence he was in texas at the 
time of two of the attacks 
the lawyers contend the photo of ramirez with his parents and a 
niece was taken on may 25 1985 the day of his nieces first 
communion in el paso texas 
the suspects father julian ramirez tapia testified earlier 
that his son arrived two days before the event and stayed for eight 
days placing him out of town when the attacks occurred 
earlier prosecution testimony had linked ramirez to the murder of 
mabel bell and the attempted murder of her roommate between may 29 
and june 1 1985 and the rape of another woman on may 30 1985 
ramirezs sisterinlaw maria torres testified monday that she 
saw ramirez in el paso on may 25 and may 29 1985 she said she 
remembered because may 29 was the onemonth anniversary after i 
separated from my husband 
raymundo pantoja a friend of ramirezs father also testified 
that he saw ramirez on may 25 1985 
the defenses contention that ramirez was a victim of mistaken 
identity was challenged during the trial by prosecution witnesses 
including a local dentist who said he treated ramirez on may 30 
1985 
ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies in 
connection with the noctural attacks 
the 29yearold drifter and selfdescribed devil worshipper was 
arrested aug 31 1985 after a crowd of east los angeles residents 
recognized him from news photographs and captured him as he 
allegedly tried to steal a car

prime minister yitzhak shamir may try to keep 
his governing coalition from collapsing by proposing a new cabinet 
vote on israels plan for seeking peace with the palestinians his 
spokesman said today 
the labor party partner of shamirs rightwing likud bloc in the 
coalition has threatened to quit the cabinet and force new national 
elections 
in a resolution passed monday by its 120member leadership 
bureau labor accused likud of torpedoing chances of starting peace 
talks and added there is no room under these circumstances for the 
continuation of the government 
labors decision came in response to the tough new conditions 
adopted by likud on the proposal for elections in the occupied 
territories 
a labor pullout would require ratification by its decisionmaking 
central committee which was expected to meet within three weeks 
shamirs peace plan proposes that 17 million palestinians in the 
occupied territories elect representatives to talks with israel 
about an interim period of limited selfrule in these areas the 
final status of the territories would be decided in later talks 
likud hardliners subsquently toughened the plan with more 
conditions including a demand that elections be delayed pending an 
end to the 19month palestinian uprising in the disputed lands and 
that arabs in east jerusalem be barred from voting 
likud also called for the continued construction of jewish 
settlements in the west bank and gaza strip and said it would never 
agree to palestinian statehood in these areas 
despite the tensions that likuds program has generated some 
israeli analysts have predicted the dispute could be resolved before 
labor convenes its central committee 
the time lapse can give shamir and his allies breathing space 
to erase the results of likuds meeting political commentator 
akiva eldar wrote in the haaretz daily 
shamir was making efforts to placate labor and was considering a 
new vote on the peace plan which could remove the partys rationale 
for leaving the government haaretz and four other newspapers said 
in frontpage stories 
the news reports said the vote would likely be on a proposal put 
forward by industry minister ariel sharon calling for adding to the 
peace initiative the hardline conditions that likud adopted as 
party policy 
the cabinet would likely defeat the proposals reinforcing the 
peace plan without condtions the israeli newspapers said the 
cabinet first passed the plan by a 206 vote in may 
ahimeir shamirs spokesman confirmed in a telephone interview 
that sharons proposals for a cabinet vote were on the premiers 
desk 
you could say that the prime ministers office should be 
interested in holding such a vote ahimeir said 
secretary of state james a baker iii referred to the likud 
principles as not helpful last week and said monday he wanted 
assurances about israels intentions 
likud and labor formed their governing coalition in december

more than 25000 people many fearful of life in 
this british colony when it reverts to chinese rule flocked today 
to take advantage of a new policy in singapore relaxing immigration 
requirements 
thousands more were turned away because of the huge crush of 
people 
communist chinas suppression of its studentled movement for 
democracy has sparked fears among many of hong kongs 57 million 
people of their fate when britain returns the colony to chinese rule 
in 1997 
more than 45000 people emigrated from the colony last year and 
this year even more are expected to leave 
a line of about 10000 people standing five abreast stretched 
for blocks in downtown hong kong when officials at singapore 
management corp decided to stop handing out applications for 
permanent residence in singapore 
the governmentowned company set up several years ago to entice 
welleducated and rich hong kong residents to singapore said that 
from now on it only would accept applications by mail 
the crush at the company came one day after singapore announced 
it was relaxing requirements for hong kong residents to become 
permanent residents in the republic 
britain has said repeatedly that it will not give hong kongs 
people the right to live in britain causing many to look elsewhere 
for a haven 
michael lim general manager of the singapore company said an 
overwelming demand for application forms forced the company to 
close its offices 
in the interest of public safety we have decided to close the 
booth and ask applicants to apply by post lim said 
another spokesman for the company said today that 15000 
application forms for permanent residency had been handed out before 
the offices were shut down police said about 10000 people were 
turned away and that there were no incidents of violence 
singapores new permanent residence plan lowers educational and 
monetary prerequisites 
the previous plan was limited to those with a university degree 
or the professional equivalent and enterpreneurs willing to invest 
512000 in singapore 
now any workers with at least five years of employment will be 
allowed to apply as well businessmen who invest less than 500000 
provided their businesses are approved by the economic development 
board 
singapore has decided to liberalize its rules to compete with 
developed countries in recruiting skilled workers technicians and 
professionals 
singapores growing economy requires more such people than are 
being produced domestically said a statement from the singapore 
government this liberalization applies to immigrants from all 
sources whatever their ethnic background so long as they can be 
integrated into singapore society without upsetting the present 
balance in its multiracial character 
still it is significant that most of the applicants were 
expected to be ethnic chinese 
of singapores 26 million people 76 percent are chinese 15 
percent malays 6 percent indians and the rest eurasians and 
europeans

troops have arrested 1000 suspected 
sinhalese extremists during raids on insurgent hideouts in the 
capital and three central districts the government said today 
the troops recovered land mines guns ammunition and military 
uniforms during the raids on sunday and monday an information 
department statement said 
a shortwave band radio transmitter also was confiscated in the 
southern hungama town 85 miles south of colombo the statement said 
besides colombo the operations were carried out in the districts 
of badulla kandy and moneragala it said the suspects were 
detained for questioning it said no further details were given 
the raids were part of a government crackdown on members of the 
leftwing peoples liberation front who have been fighting to 
topple president ranasinghe premadasas government 
the sinhalese extremists began their antigovernment campaign two 
years ago to protest peace overtures made to tamil rebels the 
sinhalese militants said too many concessions to the minority tamils 
were made in an indiansri lankan peace accord that tried to end the 
tamil rebellion 
the sinhalese front is also believed to have sponsored a 
crippling onemonth transport workers strike 
transport minister wijepala mendis said monday the strike by the 
40000 workers of the stateowned public transport company had been 
broken he said a fair percentage of workers reported for duty 
after the government announced that strikers would be arrested 
in an attempt to crush civil unrest premadasa imposed a 
nationwide state of emergency june 20 giving security forces wide 
powers to arrest and detain without legal obligations 
on thursday the government said it ordered troops and police to 
shoot saboteurs and those putting up antigovernment posters a 
censorship campaign was also imposed the same day 
the sinhalese extremists also have protested the presence of 
indian troops invited to maintain the indiansri lankan accord and 
break the tamil rebellion saying it compromised the countrys 
independence 
premadasas request to india to withdraw the troops has failed to 
appease the sinhalese radicals 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalese who 
constitute 75 percent of the population and control the government 
and the military

here are excerpts from solidarity leader 
lech walesas remarks introducing president bush at the solidarity 
workers monument tuesday walesa spoke in polish 
ladies and gentleman i have lived for 25 years in gdansk and i 
have never seen anything like this on behalf of all of you 
tired with waiting i would like to welcome mr president of the 
united states his wife and all of the guests present here 
mr president we are here today standing at the place which for 
poles is a special one we are grateful to you mr president we 
are grateful to mrs bush and all the american officials who have 
come here to the monument of fallen shipyard workers those who fell 
for bread and freedom 
a dramatic challenge of fate has caused that this place where one 
man shot another where when men shot men is the place where 
solidarity was born 
you are aware mr president of our tangled and difficult route 
which hasnt run its course yet for we continually keep facing very 
difficult tasks 
if the bends in that road have not discouraged us from 
action this happened to a large extent thanks to our conviction 
that we were not alone that we can count on our friends and their 
solidarity with us 
we have found ourselves today in a situation in which political 
reform was necessary because a slave never makes a good worker 
and also for another reason because todays progress of 
civilization cannot develop in an atmosphere of restraining monopoly 
so were shaking off that ugly hump of totalitarian stalinism 
and were trying to catch up with the rest of europe and the whole 
developed world which is getting farther and farther away from us 
we are heading towards democracy and pluralism but all this 
makes it necessary for us to keep in mind the proportions that must 
exist between the reforms in the economic sphere and those in the 
political sphere 
changes must occur at the same time in both of these fields at 
the same time and equally the experience of china has taught us a 
lesson if the proportions are not respected we will not be able to 
succeed 
if we want our square the square of solidarity where we are now 
to be kept in the memory of generations forever as a place of hope 
we must all work together to make sure that economic changes follow 
closely those in the political field 
the people who are standing around the monument today are good 
workers just as the millions of poles polish men and women in the 
united states as well as the whole of europe are trying to help and 
have an influence through their economic policy the course of our 
reforms 
it can have millions of hands removed from useless work to hve 
solid sane healthy economically healthy cooperation to proceed 
and competition between our enterprises and finally it can help 
the lack of an effective economic reform it can prevent it from 
destabilizing this part of the world 
this would be a threat to poland as well as to other countries 
it would be a failure of democracy 
i attempted to present this point of view orally and in writing 
to you mr president im expressing my hope and the hope of 
millions of poles that you will leave poland convinced that our 
country is worthy of your help and should be helped 
i truly believe that the links between our nations will gain a 
new stimulus and that more than ever before solidarity will become 
a challenge to poles and americans god bless america and god bless 
our homeland

guerrillas ambushed an israeli army 
patrol in south lebanon early today and two soldiers were wounded in 
a firefight that was followed by an israeli artillery barrage army 
and security sources said 
israel later bolstered its forces in south lebanon with about 150 
soldiers in a mechanized force armed with tanks and armored cars 
howitzers and surfacetoair missiles the sources said troops also 
sealed all four gateways linking israels buffer zone in south 
lebanon to the rest of the nation they said 
the patrol came under fire in the hasbaya region on the northern 
edge of israels selfdeclared security zone said one security 
source on condition of anonymity 
the two wounded soldiers were evacuted by an israeli helicopter 
under the cover of heavy artillery barrage the source said 
an army spokesman in jerusalem said one soldier was wounded 
slightly the other moderately no casualties were reported among 
the guerrillas whom the source would not identify 
the army fired more than 400 rounds of artillery into areas north 
of the zone the heaviest barrage in years security sources said 
the barrage was aimed at areas around the towns of hasbaya and 
maidoun they said 
the army spokesman in jerusalem said the fighting occurred north 
of the security zone and came during the armys second thrust 
outside of the zone in two days 
sources in south lebanon said however that the fight apparently 
broke out as the army withdrew from the first operation a raid 
against hezbollah a lebanese shiite moslem militia backed by iran 
israeli troops and their allies in the south lebanon army militia 
had raided guerrilla hideouts around the village of dellaya three 
miles north of the buffer zone killing three guerrillas 
the threehour raid was triggered by an attack on the zone 
earlier in the day by palestinian and leftist lebanese guerrillas 
the lebanese reports said the attacking guerrillas were from two 
palestinian factions the popular struggle front and the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine and the syrian socialist 
nationalist party a leftist lebanese militia 
israel retained control over the 6to10miledeep buffer zone in 
1985 as it withdrew from lebanon to protect its northern border 
from guerrilla attacks

outside a rehabilitation center room for miriam stoltzgurney to say 
who killed her friend shot her in the head and left her to die in 
the woods 
last week she remembered and pointed the finger at her 
exhusband 
police arrested george gurney 52 and charged him with 
firstdegree murder kidnapping and attempted murder he is accused 
of killing roger whittemore 52 of swampscott mass and taking 
his exwife prisoner on feb 16 
state attorney general john arnold said gurney of newburyport 
mass had been a suspect from the outset 
gurney denies the shootings and is fighting extradition from 
massachusetts but new hampshire authorities are confident hell be 
in their custody soon 
at a district court hearing friday in lawrence mass gurney 
pleaded innocent to being a fugitive from the new hampshire charges 
assistant attorney general michael ramsdell credits 
stoltzgurneys willpower for her recovery from near death 
her recovery has been incredible he said after being in a 
coma for one week she has steadily progressed to the point where 
she was able to talk about the incidents that led to the shootings 
gurney said he was at home ill with a sinus condition the night 
stoltzgurney claims he burst into her bedroom wearing camouflage 
fatigues and leather boots he also denies owning camouflage 
clothing 
everybody believes her story because shes the heroine 
gurney said in a jailhouse interview with the lawrence mass 
eagletribune where he worked as an advertising salesman until his 
arrest thursday im glad for her that shes doing so well but i 
just dont know why shes saying it was me it was not me 
during her treatment at a salem rehabilitation center police 
posted a 24hour guard and kept her whereabouts secret while they 
waited for the 48yearold windham resident to slowly recover her 
memory 
on july 2 she told police gurney shot the couple 
friends said stoltzgurney and whittemore had planned on going 
out to dinner but stayed in because of bad weather 
according to court records stoltzgurney said gurney confronted 
them in her bedroom at 1130 pm on feb 15 but instead of using a 
rifle he had brought with him he grabbed her 22caliber handgun 
from a bedstand 
she said he covered whittemores head with a pillowcase tied his 
hands and forced them downstairs into the living room she said 
gurney beat whittemore with fireplace tongs before shooting him 
whittemores partly clothed body was found two days later in her 
back yard

at gunpoint into her car they drove to the woods where the last 
thing she remembers was another gunshot 
a man jogging with his dog found her lying in a pool of blood 
that afternoon 
an art teacher in the haverhill mass school system she 
married gurney in 1980 the couple divorced six years later friends 
said she met whittemore about eight years ago when she bought a car 
from him 
mona spaulding gurneys landlord said gurney and stoltzgurney 
behaved as though they were still married when stoltzgurney visited 
i know george was very much in love with her she said it 
would energize him every time he knew she would be visiting hed 
prepare the porch area for a romantic candlelight dinner 
they exchanged valentines day cards just before the shooting 
ms spaulding said 
i had no idea until recently that the two were divorced she 
said he said they loved each other but couldnt live together 
but gurney characterized the relationship as platonic 
theyre talking like this was some kind of fatal attraction 
he said she confided in me and about the men in her life she 
came to me for advice about them im not denying there was 
jealousy when the breakup first happened but its been watered down 
over the years 
gurney said he doesnt doubt parts of her story 
but shes got the wrong guy he added

here is the transcript of president bushs 
speech tuesday at the solidarity workers monument outside the lenin 
shipyard 
hello lech walesa hello to solidarnosc hello polska and 
congratulations on what youve done since i last visited the first 
free elections in modern polska 
poland has a special place in the american heart and in my heart 
and when you hurt we feel pain and when you dream we feel hope and 
when you succeed we feel joy it goes far beyond diplomatic 
relations its more like family relations and coming to poland is 
like coming home 
this special kinship is the kinship of an ancient dream a 
recurring dream the dream of freedom 
they are accustomed to liberty wrote a byzantine historian 
about the slavic people more than 1000 years ago and the spirit of 
the poles has been conveyed across the centuries and across the 
ocean a dream that would not die 
that dream was severely tested here in gdansk 50 years ago this 
summer the predawn quiet of this peaceful baltic harbor was 
shattered by the thunder from the 15inch guns of nazi warship 
schleswig holstein within the hour iron panzers rolled across the 
polish frontier and europe was plunged into darkness that would 
engulf the world 
for poland the choices were few surrender to tyranny or resist 
against impossible odds and in the brutal fighting that followed 
you set a standard for courage that will never be forgotten 
in world war ii poland lost everything except her honor except 
her dreams before poland fell you gave the allies enigma the 
nazis secret coding machine breaking the unbreakable axis code 
saved tens of thousands of allied lives of american lives and for 
this you have the enduring gratitude of the american people and 
ultimately enigma and freedom fighters played a major role in 
winning the second world war 
but for you the wars end did not end the darkness the cold war 
brought a long and chilly night of sorrow and hardship and the dream 
was again denied and yet there were glimmers of the long awaited 
dawn 
in the summer of 1980 you occupied the shipyards where we stand 
and a patriotic electrician clambered over these iron gates and 
emerged as one of the heroes of our times lech walesa 
and above your streets a graceful momument rose in the tradition 
of our own statue of liberty to become a symbol recognized around 
the world as a beacon of hope 
but the hope like the dawn proved fleeting for under cover of 
darkness the electrician was arrested and your movement outlawed 
and in the icy cold of a savage winter a modern nation was sealed 
off from the outside world 
but still the dream would not die 
in the wintry darkness candles appeared in silent protest 
lighting the windows of your villages of your cities and as the 
years unfolded and as the world watched in wonder you the polish 
people and your leaders turned despair into hope turned darkness 
into dreams 
hope and hard work were the foundations of polands resurrection 
as a state in 1918 against enormous odds confidence and 
determination made that dream a reality and these same qualities 
have brought you to this new crossroads in history 
your time has come it is polands time of possibilities its 
time of responsibilities 
it is polands time of destiny a time when dreams can live again 
solidarity reborn productive negotiations between the government 
of poland and the polish people and the first fruits of democracy 
elections 
at another time in another city where the human spirit was 
being tested a great american president spoke eloquently about the 
struggle for liberty 
today the world watches the inevitable outcome of that struggle 
today to those who think that hope can be forever suppressed i 
say let them look at poland 
to those who think that freedom can be forever denied i say let 
them look at poland 
and to those who think that dreams can be forever repressed i 
say let them look at poland for here in poland the dream is alive

hard way he had fun for awhile

a beacon of hope a symbol of that dream and the brave workers of 
gdansk know poland is not alone america stands with you 
because americans are so free to dream we feel a special kinship 
with those who dream of a better future 
here in poland the united states supports the roundtable accords 
and applauds the wisdom tenacity and patience of one of polands 
great leaders lech walesa 
and we share a movement that has touched the imagination of the 
world that movement is solidarnosc and we applaud those who have 
made this progress possible the polish people 
we recognize too that the polish government has shown wisdom 
and creativity and courage in proceeding with these historic steps 
poles and americans share a commitment to overcome the division 
of europe and to redeem the promise that is the birthright of men 
and women throughout the world poles and americans want europe to 
be whole and free 
a more democratic poland can be a more prosperous poland the 
roundtable provisions as they continue to be carried out can 
liberate the energy of a dynamic people to work together to build a 
better life 
we understand the legacy of distrust and shattered dreams as 
poles of all political complexions travel together down the path of 
negotiation and compromise your challenge is to rise above distrust 
and bring the polish people together toward a common purpose 
speaking before the new parliament and the senate your freely 
elected senate i outlined steps that america is prepared to take to 
assist poland as you move forward on the path of reform 
it will not be easy sacrifice and economic hardship have already 
been the lot of the polish people and hard times are not yet at an 
end 
economic reform requires hard work and restraint before the 
benefits are realized and it requires patience and determination 
but the polish people are no strangers to hard work and have 
taught the world about determination 
so i say follow your dream of a better life for you and your 
children you can see a new and prosperous poland not overnight 
not in a year but yes a new and prosperous poland in your lifetime 
its been done by polish people before hopeful immigrants came 
to that magical place called america and built a new life for 
themselves in a single generation and it can be done by polish 
people again but this time it will be done in poland 
just before i left a few days ago i was asked in my beautiful 
oval office in the white house by one of your journalists if i 
would leave poland and go to america were i a young pole 
and i answered that in this time of bright promise of historic 
transition of unique opportunity i would want to stay in poland 
and be a part of it help make the dream come true for all the 
polish people 
the crowd chanted stay with us 
the magic of america is not found in the majesty of her land 
and yes our country has been blessed but poland too is a land of 
natural beauty ample timber and ore and water and coal abundant 
agriculture potential and a talented creative people that is 
determined to succeed 
no the magic of america is in an idea i described it in my 
first moments as president of the united states 
we know what works freedom works we know whats right freedom 
is right 
we know how to secure a more just and prosperous land for man on 
earth and today you can rediscover a new land a land of your 
dreams a land of your own making a poland strong and proud 
poland is where world war ii began and poland is where and why 
the cold war got started and it is here in poland where we can 
work to end the division of europe 
it is in your power to help end the division of europe i can 
think of no finer or more capable people with whom to entrust this 
mission 
and just as the son of poland has shown the world the heights of 
spiritual leadership in the vatican so the people of poland can 
show the world what a free people with commitment and energy can 
accomplish 
a new century is almost upon us it is alive with possibilities 
and in your quest for a better future for yourselves and for those 
wonderful children that i saw coming in from the airport in that 
quest america stands shoulder to shoulder with the polish people in 
solidarity 
americans and poles both know that nothing can stop an idea whose 
time has come the dream is a poland reborn and the dream is alive

the soviet union is willing to consider a us 
proposal for trial inspections of strategic nuclear weapons a 
government official said today 
lt gen konstantin f mikhailov first deputy chief of the 
foreign ministrys arms limitation and disarmament administration 
told reporters the suggestion was in line with soviet policy on 
other issues 
a similar proposal was proposed by us for monitoring heavy 
bombers hardware and if you have in mind the experiment for 
monitoring strategic nuclear weapons we are prepared to discuss 
this question mikhailov told a regular foreign ministry news 
briefing 
mikhailov commented in response to a question about deputy 
foreign minister viktor p karpovs remarks in a washington post 
interview that moscow could accept us proposals for trial 
inspections of nuclear weapons systems as long as more weapons are 
covered 
karpov who was a chief negotiator at geneva arms control talks 
also was quoted as saying the soviets would consider limits on 
multiwarhead mobile missiles 
karpov in a moscow interview reported in todays editions of the 
washington newspaper said such inspections should not prevent the 
normal development of negotiations in geneva or be a precondition 
for work on the draft text and protocols they should go hand in 
hand 
but karpov said the soviets want to include more weapons systems 
than were envisioned in the us proposal put forward in the 
strategic arms reduction talks in geneva last month for monitoring 
experiments while the negotiations are under way 
us officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experiments 
to silobased missiles and mobile strategic missiles karpov 
however was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber bases 
should be included 
the first monitoring should be of sealaunched cruise missiles 
one of the areas where the most difficult verification problems 
arise he said he also suggested inspectors might visit each 
others cruise missile factories 
although the united states proposed continuous monitoring of 
entrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles 
it has no such plants of its own 
however the bush administration has proposed putting the 
10warhead mx missile on rail cars and the proposed singlewarhead 
midgetman on mobile land transporters 
karpov said if we can have inspectors at production plants for 
the mx or the midgetman then we would be ready to have such a team 
at our plant producing the multiwarhead ss24 a mobile missile 
asked if the soviets would consider banning or sharply limiting 
such missiles karpov said i think that can be considered 
he said the soviet union might also accept a ban on nuclear 
cruise missiles of any range instead of numerical limits on the 
longrange strategic variety it has put forward if we can find 
efficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclear 
weapons in a way that wont harm us and soviet security 
interests

down by its hunters and its tongue sticks to the ice

a christian warplane flew over 
syrianpoliced west beirut today a day after aides said christian 
army commander gen michel aoun would use air strikes against syrian 
gunboats blockading christian ports 
police said the aging hawker hunter flew at a very low altitude 
over west beiruts waterfront where the syrians maintain howitzer 
batteries that have been shelling the christian coastline for more 
than four months 
it came very low over the sea from the north flew low over the 
boulevard and then turned west and north again said an 
eyewitness who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said syrian gunners manning dozens of multibarreled 
antiaircraft guns in west beirut did not open up on the jet fighter 
it seems their radars did not detect the hawker hunter because 
it flew very low the spokesman said 
a source at aouns air force speaking on condition of anonymity 
described the midday overflight as a drill he would not say more 
the flight was the first by one of aouns three operational 
hawker hunters since the outbreak of the confrontation with the 
syrians and allied forces in march 
aides to aoun said monday the 54yearold maronite general was 
planning air strikes against syrian gunboats blockading the 
coastline of the 310squaremile christian region north of beirut to 
block iraqisupplied war materiel 
in addition to the britishmade hawker hunters aoun has eight 
frenchdesigned gazelle helicopter gunships 
aouns aides say the syrians have six gunboats patrolling the 
christiancontrolled 28mile stretch of lebanons 130mile 
mediterranean coast 
on monday syrian shelling sank a greekowned oil tanker that 
unloaded its cargo at a christian port syrian gunboats this week 
intercepted at least three cargo ships carrying food supplies and a 
fuel tanker headed for the christian enclave 
the independent daily paper annahar said international 
reinsurance companies have doubled the premium for ships sailing to 
lebanon because of the new risks involved 
arab league efforts to halt the 17week confrontation appear to 
be making little headway by police count the latest round of 
violence has killed 405 people and wounded 1581 people 
aoun addressing a news conference monday said he rejected a 
syrian demand that ships heading for the christian enclave be 
searched by arab observers for weapons 
asked whether his forces did receive sovietdesigned frog7 
missiles from iraq aoun said im not going to say yes or no let 
the syrians find out the hard way 
the syrians who have an estimated 40000 troops in lebanon under 
a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate tightened their blockade 
after demanding removal of the missiles which are capable of 
striking damascus 
the beirut daily paper ashsharq which is close to syria quoted 
unidentified foreign intelligence officials as saying iran 
pledged to provide lebanese moslem and leftist factions with 
missiles to match aouns frog7s 
the latest round of violence broke out march 8 after aoun imposed 
a blockade on moslemrun ports that he said were depriving his 
government of 100 million a year in tax revenue 
the syrians who back a rival moslem government retaliated by 
besieging the christian enclave and aoun pledged to drive the 
syrians out of the country

mel blanc the man of a thousand voices 
including the legions of looney tune stars such as porky pig daffy 
duck tweety pie and that mischievously silly wabbit bugs bunny has 
died he was 81 
the originator of such lines as bugs eh whats up doc 
sylvester the cats thufferin thuccotash and porkys 
ththththats all folks died monday from complications from 
heart disease and other ailments 
by his own count blanc estimated he had mastered at least 900 
different accents and dialects during a career spanning more than 50 
years 
working in an age without hightech sound effects blanc was a 
human synthesizer a verbal computer it has been estimated that 
more than 20 million people hear his voices daily 
he invented the voices of such characters as woody woodpecker 
speedy gonzalez pepe le pew tasmanian devil road runner foghorn 
leghorn heathcliffe the cat speed buggy yosemite sam and that 
oscarwinning rabbit bugs bunny 
he also did voices for the roadrunner and numerous other 
characters on 850 cartoons for warner bros looney tunes and merrie 
melodies 
he was the babbling barney rubble and the hyperactive yammering 
dino fred flintstones pet dinosaur on the popular hannabarbera 
series mr spacely on the jetsons and the frito bandito 
those voices were part of him and he loved every moment of 
it said blancs son noel when the kids would come to the door 
or in the studio he became those characters 
his final cartoon contribution came with 1988s popular 
animationlive action film who framed roger rabbit in which he 
did the voices of daffy tweety bugs and sylvester 
the films director robert zemeckis called blanc a man whose 
talent transcended all ages and broke through to the child in all of 
us 
longtime friend mickey rooney said the reservoir of hollywood 
legends is extremely low and mel blancs passing is a deep personal 
loss 
born in san francisco on may 30 1908 and raised in portland 
ore blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school 
he started his career in 1927 as a musician and radio perfomer 
in 1928 blanc who played the bass violin and sousaphone was 
hired by the nbc radio orchestra in san francisco 
in 1937 he joined warner bros cartoon studio which produced 
one short feature subject each week 
his first warner character was a drunken bull in the looney tunes 
short picador porky as legend has it the actor playing porky 
in that short did stutter a few months later blanc took over in 
porkys duck hunt stuttering intact and created daffy duck 
blanc introduced bugs in the 1940 short a wild hare giving 
the character a combination bronx and brooklyn accent bugs won an 
oscar in 1958 for nighty night bugs 
elmer fudd the frustrated hunter who could neither catch bugs 
bunny nor pronounce his rs was one of the few warner bros 
cartoon voices that wasnt created by blanc it was first done by 
arthur o bryan but blanc took over the voice in 1959 when bryan 
died 
blanc eventually became known as the man of a thousand 
voices but the most warner ever paid him was 20000 and the 
studio retained rights to the phrases blanc invented 
in addition to working in animation he was a regular on radios 
the jack benny show playing professor leblanc bennys violin 
teacher and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of 
anaheim azusa and kookamunga 
blanc also made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 maxwell 
automobile owned by bennys skinflint comedy character 
he reprised many of the roles when benny moved to television 
while recuperating in 1961 from a nearfatal car accident blanc 
once recalled he tried to count all his cartoon voices he said he 
fell asleep shortly after 400 
he said when he came to his first words to a physician were 
whats up doc 
in an interview last year blanc said bugs originally called 
happy rabbit was his favorite everybody knows who i am doc 
he said in the characters voice i dont cayuh where dey are or 
who dey are even in mars dey know about me 
blanc made his last recording a car commercial on may 19 the 
day he entered cedarssinai medical center 
the only thing he said was thats all folks and thats the 
last thing that was recorded on tape said blancs son who 
according to the elder blanc is the only person who can imitate his 
myriad voices 
but mel blanc always will be remembered 
as long as these cartoons are seen and enjoyed mel blancs 
genius will be there for everyone said robert a daly warner 
bros chairman and chief executive officer 
in addition to blancs son survivors include his wife the 
former estelle rosenbaum funeral services were pending

sen bob graham said today former colleague 
chic hecht does not deserve to be us ambassador to the bahamas 
because he lacks the qualities needed to work with the island nation 
to combat drug trafficking 
but other senators said hechts record has been distorted and 
that he is fully qualified by his senate service and a banking and 
retail career to serve as a us ambassador 
it is difficult to speak in opposition to the confirmation of a 
former colleague graham dfla said at the outset of debate on 
confirmation of the former nevada senator to the ambassadorial post 
but graham said members of the senate stand in a unique 
position to evaluate whether he has the requisite qualities for 
the ambassadorship which involves coordinating the us antidrug 
effort with bahamian leaders 
i regretfully come to the conclusion that this individual does 
not meet the standards that i believe our nation should set that he 
does not send to the world the statement of our commitment to 
victory in the war on drugs graham said he does not 
deserve nor does our nation deserve to be represented by him in 
the bahamas 
disagreeing sen harry reid dnev said his former homestate 
colleague was jesting when he said he looked forward to service in 
the bahamas because of the pleasant lifestyle golf gambling and 
fishing 
sen jesse helms rnc said hecht had merely been attempting 
to say that both the bahamas and las vegas nev have 
multimilliondollar tourist industries of great importance to their 
economies 
it is not something to be twisted and misrepresented and 
heehawed by journalistic pygmies in the news media helms said 
declaring that hecht has been attacked only because of his record as 
a conservative 
chic is a remarkable man helms said he is probably the 
brightest man to serve in the senate 
reid helms and sen steve symms ridaho all said that hechts 
experience as the owner of a nevada bank will serve him well in 
dealing with a situation in the bahamas in which drug traffickers 
are said to use local banks to launder their illicit profits 
graham is leading the fight against confirmation of hecht known 
for his malapropisms while serving in congress hecht is opposed by 
some former colleagues who say they are worried that he would be 
more interested in golf than in waging war on drugs 
opponents are defying a tradition that the senate almost never 
turns on a former colleague named to a post requiring confirmation 
that tradition was severely dented earlier this year when the senate 
rejected the nomination of former sen john tower rtexas to be 
secretary of defense 
but even the semblance of opposition is unusual graham contended 
in advance of todays debate that hecht whom he called a barrel 
of gaffes deserved opposition because he is known more for 
misstatements than diplomatic and law enforcement expertise 
graham has said that the next us ambassador to the bahamas must 
play a vital operational role in ending the island nations 
role as a transit point for narcotics destined for american streets 
in his floor speech today graham said the american ambassador to 
the bahamas must spend considerable time in coordinating drug 
enforcement activities 
we need to have in that critical position not only someone 
who has the requisite background in diplomatic and foreign policy 
but we also need someone who can give to the citizens of the bahamas 
confidence in his or her ability to lead an effective effort in 
the war against drugs he said 
at confirmation hearings before the senate foreign relations 
committee earlier this year hecht drew criticism for his 
lighthearted approach to his appointment 
i am sure i will feel at home in the bahamas hecht said 
ive been involved in gambling in nevada and ive been involved 
in banking for 25 years 
also i understand it is a nice lifestyle he said i love 
golf and they have a lot of nice golf courses and good fishing 
hecht 60 who spent most of his working life in the womens 
apparel industry was defeated last year in his bid for a second 
sixyear senate term 
during the campaign he was quoted as saying he would oppose any 
nuclear suppository that could prove risky to his state

the district of columbia council today dropped 
plans to vote on a bill that would make gun manufacturers 
financially liable for injuries and deaths caused in shootings amid 
concern that the legislation might interfere with existing laws 
wilhelmina rolark chairwoman of the councils judiciary 
committee withdrew the bill to allow for further study of any 
potential conflict todays session was the last before the council 
goes into summer recess which means the matter cannot be 
reconsidered until september 
the intention of this legislation is to complement and not to 
interfere with efforts in judicial forums mrs rolark said in 
order that the council staff can do some further work on existing 
strict liability and tort laws i am withdrawing the bill 
the bill the first of its kind in the nation faced an uncertain 
reception in congress which reviews all laws passed by the council 
rep stan parris rva a frequent critic of the district 
government has likened the bill to an attempt to hold black and 
decker responsible for the texas chainsaw massacre 
walter fauntroy the districts nonvoting delegate to congress 
warned the council in a letter monday that the bill would stir up 
too much trouble in congress 
the council gave the measure preliminary approval by an 84 vote 
two weeks ago the measure was created in an attempt to slow the 
citys drugdriven record murder rate 
richard gardner state and local affairs director of the national 
rifle association said the bill is unconstitutional because it 
places an extreme limitation on interstate commerce and the federal 
government is the only body that can regulate interstate commerce 
city corporation counsel frederick d cooke also raised concerns 
about the interstate commerce restrictions during city council 
hearings last month on the measure 
council chairman david a clarke one of the bills sponsors 
said the districts handgun liability bill resembles restrictions on 
other products in other states 
historically other states have regulated things like alcohol 
and the closest thing is that some have restricted dynamite 
clarke said the only thing different about this bill is that it 
is handguns 
the liability bill is just one of several proposals made as 
drugrelated crime has increased in the nations capital 
city officials hope to hire 1200 new police officers by 1991 
more than half of them funded by the federal government 
through monday 228 persons had been killed in washington in 
1989 compared with 159 by the same time last year in 1988 a 
record 372 persons were killed 
police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs

prime minister sousuke uno today scolded two cabinet 
ministers for harming public trust in politics after one called 
women useless in politics and the other kindled fears of higher 
taxes officials said

admonished hisao horinouchi minister of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries and shigenobu sakano the home affairs minister 
shiokawa told the 21member cabinet at a meeting today some 
cabinet members lacked discretion in remarks they made recently that 
were contrary to cabinet policy any remark that may be taken to 
impair trust in national politics should be strictly avoided 
uno asked each cabinet member to behave always with a sense of 
caution defense agency chief taku yamasaki told reporters at a 
briefing after the meeting 
in a campaign speech on friday for fellow liberal democratic 
party members running in upper house elections july 23 horinouchi 
said women are useless in the world of politics 
horinouchi retracted the remark and apologized in a nationally 
televised news conference the next day but on monday the communist 
party demanded his dismissal and six women from the main opposition 
socialist party called the prime ministers office to lodge their 
protest 
sakano was quoted in news reports as saying sunday that the new 3 
percent sales tax which took effect april 1 required handling a 
lot of small change and there will be fewer coins if the 
percentage is an even number of 4 
but the reports said he added later he was not advocating an 
increase in the unpopular tax he apologized for causing 
misunderstanding 
kyodo news service said both horinouchi and sakano offered to 
resign but shiokawa persuaded them to stay uno and his cabinet have 
been in office only a month following the resignation of former 
prime minister noboru takeshita to take responsibility for a 
widespread influencepeddling scandal 
the admonitions came as the governing liberal democratic party 
was trying to woo voters in the face of predictions that it will 
lose its majority in the upper house in the july 23 elections 
it suffered losses in the july 2 tokyo metropolitan assembly 
elections that political analysts attributed to the sales tax the 
influencepeddling scandal and allegations that uno had kept paid

immoral but horinouchis remark brought even more denunciations 
from womens organizations

nurses went on strike today against 
californias largest pediatrics hospital and ambulances lined up to 
take dozens of critically ill children to other hospitals 
officials of childrens hospital were forced to search as far 
away as los angeles for beds for children with special medical needs 
after the strike vote monday night the transfer of patients was 
expected to continue until tonight 
nurses havent been getting anything in the way of raises over 
the last couple of years said mary lesander 21 who arrived to 
pick up her nurse mother and stayed to walk the line my moms got 
to support a family she cant work for next to nothing 
were in the third year of an escalating nursing shortage 
thats preventing us from giving good care said karen cooper a 
pediatrics nurse in the intensive care unit and a union spokeswoman 
were taking a painful step today to avert an even worse crisis in 
the 1990s 
more than 80 percent of the 700 childrens hospital nurses 
belonging to the california nurses association turned out for the 
vote cooper said 
although the exact tally hadnt been completed cooper said a 
large majority voted to reject an 18 percent pay raise over two 
years offered by the hospital 
the nurses who earn from 32000 to 39000 per year are 
seeking a 26 percent increase over two years 
hospital officials planned to transfer about half of the 139 
patients in the 194bed facility to other hospitals hospital 
spokesman steve tiger said 
were sad that its come to this and we feel that the wage 
demands of the nursing union are unrealistic tiger said there 
arent any real staffing shortages at this hospital 
at 6 percent childrens has the lowest vacancy rate among nurses 
in california tiger said 
many of the striking nurses planned to sign up with nursing 
registries in the area hoping to get placed temporarily at the 
hospitals where their patients are transferred cooper said 
we are worried about our patients especially since the 
hospital has been so irresponsible cooper said but were more 
worried about what will happen to the patients in a couple of years 
if we dont reverse the nursing shortage 
childrens closed its pediatrics trauma center at midnight tiger 
said 
by transferring these kids theres going to be a ripple effect 
because weve just about filled up all the pediatric beds in the bay 
area he said we normally have 30 to 40 admissions a day its 
anybodys guess where any of those kids will go 
the hospital also began postponing elective surgery and planned 
to stop admitting patients from the emergency room walkin 
emergency care would still be offered and general admissions would 
be done on a casebycase basis tiger said 
the hospital plans to continue running its pediatric intensive 
care unit despite the strike and will keep as many patients as it 
can handle with nonstaff registry nurses and nurses who cross 
picket lines

the solidarity movement welcomed george 
bush to its birthplace today as the president acknowledged the 
decades of workers courage and bloodshed that helped bring about 
polands dramatic move toward democracy 
solidarity greets the president of the usa read a huge 
redandwhite banner hung near solidarity square outside the lenin 
shipyard where the soviet blocs first independent trade union was 
founded in 1980 
twentyfive thousand poles including solidarity members from 
chapters across the country gathered at the towering workers 
monument at the yards gate to hear bush speak 
they chanted long live bush and when the president suggested 
young poles stay in their homeland instead of emigrating they 
chorused stay with us 
if only poland could have such a president said jan panchek 
91 a retired farmer who arrived hours early to glimpse bush 
now bankrupt and awaiting a possible bailout by polishamerican 
businesswoman barbara piasecka johnson the shipyard is the spirtual 
home of solidarity as recently as last august it was the scene of 
strikes that galvanized the nation 
by visiting the yard and lunching at the home of solidarity 
chief lech walesa bush planned a symbolic gesture to the workers 
whose battles with communist authorities in 1970 1980 and 1988 kept 
alive the nations aspirations for greater freedom and a better life 
the shipyard dating to the 19th century was rebuilt after world 
war ii as an industrial showcase of the newly created polish 
peoples state it turned out dozens of ships a year mainly for the 
soviet union 
workers from around the country usually from peasant 
backgrounds were attracted by its relatively high wages and promise 
of technical training one such worker in the late 1960s was a young 
man from the village of popowo lech walesa 
dingy cramped housing and hazardous working conditions soon 
created tensions among this new elite and a round of sharp price 
increases just before christmas 1970 set off strikes all along the 
baltic coast 
outside the gates of the yard security forces opened fire on 
marching workers killing several hundreds are believed to have 
died in the strikes an event that remains etched on the national 
consciousness the official death count was 45 
when solidarity arose in 1980 one of its first demands was to 
erect a monument to the victims of 1970 the 42meter sculpture of 
three crosses and anchors was designed and built by the shipyard 
workers themselves 
it remained an embarrassing reminder to the government during the 
years after the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown when solidarity 
was banned but struggled on as an illegal organization 
authorities claimed solidarity was dead except for a few thousand 
diehards but the union kept up a vibrant underground structure 
waves of strikes in may and august 1988 demonstrated solidarity 
was still very much alive in exchange for ending the august unrest 
authorities resumed negotiations with walesa 
that led to the legalization of solidarity and to last months 
elections in which unionbacked candidates won all but one of the 
261 seats they were allowed to contest 
union organizing took second place to the election campaign and 
leaders concede they have signed up only a fraction of their former 
strength of 10 million between 1 million and 2 million members 
solidarity now must contend with a number of painful new 
challenges 
polands need to reform the crisisridden economy into a 
competitive marketoriented structure could require closing 
outmoded and inefficient factories where solidarity members work 
and eliminating state subsidies for meat milk and other staples 
will bring steep price increases

two bombs exploded in mecca as thousands 
of people took part in the annual pilgrimage to islams most sacred 
city killing one person and injuring 16 the official saudi press 
said today 
two of the injured are in critical condition the saudi news 
agency said quoting an unnamed saudi interior ministry security 
official 
no one claimed responsibility for the blasts which occurred at 
10 pm monday while hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were praying 
and walking around the kaaba islams holiest shrine inside the 
grand mosque 
iran which has boycotted the pilgrimage this year in a feud with 
saudi arabia accused the saudis of planting the bombs to discredit 
tehran 
irans prime minister hussein musavi said the two bomb blasts 
late monday were an effort by the saudi regime to create a climate 
of suppression and repression the official islamic republic news 
agency reported tuesday 
a iranian foreign ministry statement urged pilgrims in mecca to 
protest the bombings which it said were carried out by the united 
states and its agents in the region a reference to prowestern 
saudi arabia 
security sources in riyadh said a number of suspects have been 
arrested and are being interrogated 
they said the injured include pakistanis indians egyptians and 
two saudis the identity of the dead person has not been released 
the explosions occurred on the main road leading to the grand 
mosque and a nearby overpass 
one of the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
explosives were bombs of the type that makes a loud bang has 
quick impact but causes little damage 
diplomatic sources said investigators believe they were crude 
timed devices or they would have injured more people 
an estimated 18 million moslems from more than 80 countries are 
in mecca on the annual pilgrimage to the city birthplace of the 
prophet mohammed during the pilgrimage known as hajj moslems also 
travel to medina to visit the tomb of the 7th century founder of 
islam 
a pilgrimage is one of the five basic duties of all moslems 
iran is boycotting the hajj because of limits on the number of 
pilgrims who can take part and has called on moslems to disrupt the 
ceremonies last year saudi arabia began limiting the number of 
pilgrims to mecca and medina based on a countrys population 
security sources refused to link mondays explosions to the 
iranians saying the investigations were incomplete 
only a small number of iranians came on their own and these 
were mainly from europe said one security source 
the pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since 
irans islamic revolution in 1979 in that year religious 
extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca and held it for two 
weeks before saudi forces stormed it 
more than 250 people were killed saudi authorities later 
beheaded 63 more 
the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary guards posing 
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives 
the next year 402 pilgrims mostly iranians were killed in 
riots in mecca that the saudis say were instigated by 
fundamentalists 
saudi arabia cut ties with iran in april 1988 tehran since has 
campaigned to strip king fahd of his title as custodian of the two 
holy shrines and place mecca and medina under international 
supervision

buildings to have as many toilets for women as they do for men the 
measure subject of sometimes silly debate passed the legislature

and built after june 1 1990 the number of toilets in a womens 
room would have to equal the number of urinals and toilet stalls in 
mens rooms 
two other states have similar laws according to assembly sponsor

moviegoers are too sloppy so the 
city will ban all eating and drinking in cinemas the mayor said 
tuesday 
mayor elyas omar said the move was to ensure the cleanliness of 
the theaters which often are dirty because of empty food packets 
and drink containers being left behind by patrons 
the cinemas should be clean places that provide comfort to 
patrons not places for eating and drinking if one wants to eat or 
drink the place to do it is a stall or a restaurant elyas said 
at a meeting with three officials of borneo film organization ltd 
he suggested the theaters have a stand outside to sell food and 
drinks and for patrons to consume it there 
elyas did not say what would be done to those ignoring the 
warning but other officials said the law forbidding littering in 
public places could be applied to the movie houses under this law 
people face fines of up to 185 even for flicking cigarette ashes

lawyers have selected a federal court jury of 
eight people to hear a trial on behalf of 8000 farmers in 10 states 
who sued a company that allegedly oversold 1988 drought insurance 
policies 
the trial was scheduled to begin wednesday before us district 
judge carl b rubin 
us magistrate robert steinberg presided over mondays jury 
selection rubin was to decide later which of the eight jury members 
will be alternates since a civil jury usually has six members the 
trial could last two weeks lawyers said 
in the lawsuit the farmers are asking for damages of at least 
20 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages against good 
weather international corp of syosset ny said stanley m 
chesley a cincinnati lawyer representing the farmers 
his clients allege that good weather sold them drought insurance 
policies backed by chubb corp of warren nj 
chubb later canceled the farmers drought insurance coverage 
after learning good weather had sold more than the available number 
of such policies 
chubb has joined the farmers from ohio illinois iowa kentucky 
indiana tennessee minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin as 
plaintiffs in the suit 
chesley said the farmers and chubb have an agreement in which the 
farmers would receive twothirds of any winnings from the lawsuit 
and chubb would get onethird 
chubb and its insurance subsidiaries agreed last november to a 
settlement in which they set aside a fund of 481 million to settle 
the farmers claims lawrence kane jr a cincinnati lawyer named by 
rubin to distribute the money to the farmers began doing so in 
march 
chubb said good weather violated its contract with the company by 
selling too many crop insurance policies chubb said good weather 
owes it at least 75 million because of the overselling and also 
wants good weather to pay the fees of lawyers chubb hired 
the farmers said they suffered emotional distress because they 
were denied drought insurance in addition to losses stemming from 
interest payments they would have received had they been issued 
policies 
good weather denies all of the claims by the farmers and chubb

hungarys leaders are hoping the first 
visit by an american president will cast a favorable light on their 
moves toward democracy and help attract more western investment 
unlike their polish counterparts the hungarians were not 
expecting any direct aid from president bush to alleviate their 
stiff foreign debt 
but like the poles the hungarians have a heavy load to carry 
hungarys nearly 18 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita 
in eastern europe 
hungary has been at the forefront of economic reforms in the 
communist bloc since the 1960s encouraging private entrepreneurs 
and even a small but energetic stock market 
it is also the land where soviet tanks and troops crushed a 
revolt against communist rulers in 1956 
today government officials and ordinary folk alike share the 
hope that the bush visit will help mend hungarys economic woes and 
further democratic reforms 
its a great honor for a small country such as ours for the no 
1 political leader of a huge country to visit it premier miklos 
nemeth told the government daily magyar hirlap 
the most important thing as far as i am concerned is to 
eliminate the doubts which still exist in the united states and in 
other western countries about a rollback in hungary and the 
security of capital investments nemeth said 
ferenc pityo who sells flowers on budapests lively main 
shopping mall vaci utca said the bush visit might do some good 
for the country as a whole 
but what would do me a lot of good is if they gave me a 
permanent and not a temporary permit to sell my flowers added the 
woman who said she has four children 
hungarys englishlanguage daily and other staterun media ran 
supplements to mark the historic visit 
im happy that the relationship is unfolding the way it is 
said zoltan benedikt a university student but im afraid that if 
bush is bringing any capital its going to be given to the company 
managers who have already shown their incompetence in handling these 
funds 
any retreat from current efforts to build a marketoriented 
economy and a multiparty democracy in hungary would be a national 
tragedy for our people nemeth said 
the premier 41 an economist who once spent a semester at 
harvard university is one of four men currently running hungary at 
the head of its communist party until a party congress selects new 
leaders this fall 
the fourman leadership took control june 24 in what was widely 
seen as a compromise between the strengthening reformist wing and 
more orthodox communists who oppose what they regard as a return to 
capitalism and the bourgeois democracy that ruled before the 
communist takeover in 1948 
party general secretary karoly grosz who previously headed the 
party alone was forced to share power with nemeth radical reformer 
imre pozsgay and rezso nyers who pioneered the economic reforms of 
the 1960s nyers fell from grace in 1973 but now has been made party 
chairman 
bush meets each of the four wednesday later he sees leaders of 
emerging democratic opposition groups negotiating with the 
communists on the framework and timetable for multiparty elections 
next year 
nemeth stressed that political and economic reforms must move 
together to avoid a political explosion that would wreck any 
changes 
western assistance is needed to transform the largely staterun 
economy he said providing new jobs for hungarians whose outmoded 
factories are threatened with closure under government austerity 
policies 
us and hungarian officials will sign four agreements wednesday 
senior foreign ministry official jenoe alfoeldi told the 
associated press that one of them involves a trade and development 
program for bozsod county in hungarys northeast a heavily 
industrialized area where large steel mills and other industries are 
running at a heavy loss 
the other agreements concern tourism air traffic and 
agriculture alfoeldi said 
while bushs visit signals western recognition of hungarys 
reforms officials emphasize budapest is not pulling too far away 
from moscow or other communist allies 
withdrawal from the warsaw pact would be quite inappropriate 
right now nemeth told magyar hirlap 
it is very important for us to preserve and develop the 
relationship with the soviet union foreign minister gyula horn 
told reporters monday

the halfcentury hollywood career of laurence 
olivier generally acclaimed the greatest englishspeaking actor 
ranged from abject failure to absolute triumph 
he was an amazingly daring actor the best of our time as 
an actor he dared to go where few others venture his close friend 
charlton heston said today after learning of oliviers death in 
london at age 82 
from the 1931 friends and lovers to the jazz singer with 
neil diamond in 1980 olivier appeared in a wide variety of american 
films but his greatest triumph on screen came with his 
selfdirected henry v and hamlet both made in england 
the highest achievement of his hollywood career came 50 years ago 
with wuthering heights it was a miserable period for the actor 
who was deeply in love with vivian leigh though both were married 
to others he had wanted miss leigh to play catherine instead of 
merle oberon 
i was blind with misery at being parted from vivian who would 
have been the perfect cathy olivier wrote in his memoirs and i 
was sure merle was lacking in the essential passionate qualities 
oberon and olivier loathed each other while playing worldclass 
lovers at first oliviers performance was so hammy that 
producer samuel goldwyn threatened to shut down the picture will 
you look at that actors ugly face hes dirty his performance is 
rotten its stagey its just nothing 
director william wyler persuaded olivier to act more subtly and 
heathcliff and catherine became classic lovers of the screen 
olivier won the first of his eight academy award nominations for 
best actor in 1939 but he was overshadowed that year by the triumph 
of his future wife miss leigh in gone with the wind 
in a 1959 interview when he arrived here for spartacus 
olivier recalled his hollywood beginnings i first came here for a 
contract at rko in 1931 with his thenwife jill esmond the film 
business was in terrible shape and we had several changes in 
management 
then david selznick became head of the studio he made some 
fine pictures he also made some fine pay cuts i refused to take 
one and was summarily dropped 
the actor returned to hollywood in 1933 to star opposite greta 
garbo in queen christina he was abruptly replaced with john 
gilbert reportedly because garbo wanted a comeback for her old 
flame gilbert 
the truth is she fired me olivier said and i must say 
that she was absolutely right i was 23 or 24 actually 26 at the 
time and i simply wasnt up to it i went back to england again 
olivier returned over the years for such triumphs as rebecca 
in 1940 carrie in 1952 and marathon man in 1976 in his 
later years he was earning 1 million per picture and was less 
selective appearing in such films as clash of the titans 
inchon and the bounty 
the hollywood film community remained in awe of the great olivier 
and in 1979 he was awarded an honorary oscar said presenter cary 
grant he represents the ultimate in acting 
oliviers acceptance speech sounded so eloquent in his well 
modulated tones that jon voight was reduced to tears later olivier 
admitted that he had forgotten his speech and adlibbed a series of 
glowing phrases that read like gibberish 
only laurence olivier could have managed such a performance

laurence olivier spoke of his life his work and 
his fellow actors in books and interviews throughout his career 
some of his comments 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the craft of acting in general 
i think there is much that the public doesnt understand 
about acting i think they understand baseball cricket or football 
a great deal better 
they say we are mere shadows i like to think of the true 
actor as a skeleton bone just bone on to which he places and 
molds the flesh rather like a sculptor but he has an advantage 
over the sculptor because his creation is animated 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on his own acting 
i am a character actor not the leading man who seeks 
applause on his first entrance 
if the new generation were required to do what i do now they 
would have extreme difficulty because it took a long time to arrive 
at where i am but i feel that if they were to teach me their job 
they would find that i could grasp it quite quickly because im 
well versed in my work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on critics 
i suppose critics are a grim necessity there are good ones 
and bad ones and ones who simply masquerade as critics but are mere 
purveyors of columns of gossip tittletattle signifying nothing 
poor creatures who are pushed by their pens and not their 
intellects

on michael caine his costar in the movie sleuth

outspokenness i could never aspire to hepburns star quality 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on king lear 
when youve the strength for it youre too young when

straightforward 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on luck 
i have often been fortunate to have been in the right place 
at the right time blessed in that way a sense of timing almost an 
instinct but then timing is made by the man i think and therefore 
man creates his own destiny take it or leave it my timing was 
right and i accept that with gratitude whether it was manmade or 
godmade

defense secretary dick cheney acknowledging he 
has no quick fix for streamlining the pentagon today put 
forward a complex plan to overhaul the military bureaucracy and 
tighten controls over weapons purchases 
he predicted that some 30 billion in total savings could be 
achieved by the 1993 fiscal year if his simplified and more 
efficient weapons acquisition system is put in place 
procurement accounts for more than 60 billion of this years 
305 billion defense budget and involves more than a halfmillion 
civilian and uniformed employees of the defense department 
at a news conference cheney said the evertightening defense 
budget as well as the amount of distrust in congress and among the 
public about the way the pentagon does business requires that 
something be done 
theres no silver bullet here we have a blueprint that we 
plan to pursue to try to significantly improve the way we do 
business he said 
but cheney a former member of the republican leadership in the 
house acknowledged that he wont be able to achieve changes on his 
own if were going to be successful it will be because we got 
congress to cooperate he said 
president bush requested the management report five months ago as 
part of a major review spurred on by a series of weapons procurement 
scandals defense industry employees and consultants and pentagon 
workers have been accused of improperly using confidential 
information to funnel lucrative contracts to certain manufacturers 
the elements of the package have been circulating in washington 
for some time the report already has stirred some opposition on 
capitol hill where it has been snubbed as not going far enough to 
outline details for revising the pentagons procurement practices 
the report seeks some relief from congressional oversight 
requests complaining about the staggering number of reports 
congress requires from the defense department each day 
some sections of the plan require congressional approval for 
instance the study asks that congress implement fully a biennial 
rather than annual defense budget and establish select committees 
in both houses to review and rewrite the maze of federal 
procurement laws 
many of the ideas included in the reform package were first 
proposed in the 1986 blue ribbon commission on defense management 
also known as the packard commission 
in a summary released with the report cheney said that because 
of competing national priorities the real resources available for 
defense in the early 1990s are likely to decline 
if we are to protect our global interests met our 
responsibilities and minimize the risks to our security we must 
preserve essential military capabilities through ever more skillful 
use of the resources at our disposal he said 
cheney called for better teamwork to put his initiatives into 
reality 
none represents a quick fix only an unreserved and sustained 
commitment on the part of the administration congress and industry 
will bring about real change he said 
the secretarys goal is to make clear the lines of authority in 
the procurement process not only to make it more responsive but 
also more responsible said one pentagon official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the proposals include 
the establishment of an executive panel to make all the major 
decisions at the defense department 
the board would be composed of the secretary the deputy 
secretary undersecretary the deputies for procurement and 
acquisitions the heads of the various services and chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff the panel would be smaller than the current 
defense resources board which advises cheney on major weapons and 
budgetary decisions 
allowing the deputy secretary of defense to oversee the 
pentagons system for planning programming and devising its budget 
the deputy secretary would oversee the defense planning and 
resources board which also will be asked to come up with a coherent 
national defense strategy as well as a 20year road map on the 
longterm needs and investment plans for the department 
enhancing the powers of the undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition dubbed the acquisition czar the undersecretary 
would have full authority for major acquisition programs which 
would trim some of the services powers 
paring down and consolidate overlapping structures in the 
acquisition system the proposal under which cheney predicts will 
eliminate layers and functions that have no value and primarily 
through payroll cuts achieve the 30 billion in savings over the 
next four budget years 
the report notes that some 580000 civilian and military 
personnel around the world are involved in the procurement process 
the report suggests trimming the organizations on a phased basis 
by at least 15 percent by 1993 
the establishment of a defense contract managment agency to 
consolidate its contract administration activities and ride herd on 
the contracts after they have been awarded 
streamlining the defense acquisitions board which would study 
the cost and performance of weapons programs at each stage of 
development 
establishing a dedicated corps of military procurement 
specialists in each service who would be career acquisition 
specialists congress will also be asked to approve legislation to 
upgrade the salaries and training of civilian acquisition officials 
setting up an ethics council composed of the acquisitions chief 
and the various service secretaries 
bush who was in warsaw on monday issued a statement supporting 
cheneys program the presidents letter accompanied the report to 
congressional leaders 
this report provides a basis for significant additional 
improvements in the management of the department of defense and in 
the defense acquisition process bush wrote he added the 
proposals would eliminate unnecessary management layers and 
activities a reform that will yield significant savings which can 
be applied to essential defense programs

thousands of sudanese demonstrated support 
for the nations new military ruler tuesday cheering wildly as he 
pledged no return to the multiparty democracy he overthrew last 
month 
exterminate exterminate government by masters the crowd 
chanted referring to the multiparty system under which ousted 
civilian prime minister sadek elmahdi had ruled since he won 1986 
elections 
yes yes government by masters will be exterminated the 
coup leader lt gen omar hassan ahmed elbashir responded in a 
15minute speech 
earlier tuesday elbashir set up four military tribunals one a 
court of appeals to try elmahdi and about 45 other ousted 
officials and politicians charged with corruption or mismanagement 
state radio reported 
heading a 15member junta elbashir 45 toppled elmahdi in an 
apparently bloodless coup june 30 
he immediately dissolved parliament disbanded political parties 
and unions and declared a nationwide state of emergency on monday 
he declared himself prime minister and defense minister 
despite temperatures well into the 100s tuesdays demonstration 
brought 20000 to 30000 people mostly workers to the presidential 
palace along the nile 
one army one nation they shouted frequently cheering and 
applauding elbashir we shall protect the revolution by hard 
work 
the crowd burned an effigy marked sectarianism in the shape 
of a bearded man wearing the kind of robe used by followers of 
elmahdis ansar sect ansar and khatmiya are the principal moslem 
sects in sudan 
khatmiya leader mohammed osman elmirghany patron of the 
democratic unionist party is among those under arrest the 
unionists and elmahdis umma were the main partners in the ousted 
coalition cabinet 
tuesdays demonstration was sanctioned by elbashirs ruling 
council but elbashir told supporters there will be no more street 
demonstrations this is the first and the last he said 
elmahdis government was rocked by street protests this year as 
citizens wearied of a 1 millionaday southern civil war that has 
fueled food shortages displaced hundreds of thousands and induced 
famine that killed perhaps a quarter million people last year 
elbashir has cited elmahdis inability to end the war as one 
reason for the coup 
on tuesday a sudanese delegation arrived in addis ababa and 
asked the ethiopian government to help settle the southern rebellion 
ethiopian state radio quoted delegation chief lt col mohammed 
elamin khalifa as saying sudans new military government wants 
ethiopia to mediate with the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
which the addis ababa government supports 
khalifas fiveman delegation was to meet president mengistu 
haile mariam and other ethiopian leaders the radio said 
it also quoted khalifa as saying he would meet with sudanese 
rebels if the situation is favorable 
elbashir says he is committed to peace but he scrapped a 
tentative accord approved by elmahdis government which included 
meeting rebel preconditions for talks by suspending sudans harsh 
islamic laws and abrogating defense pacts with libya and egypt 
the new leader says he seeks an eventual union with egypt and 
libya 
northern sudan is largely moslem and leans toward the arab world 
the rebels have been fighting for greater autonomy for the minority 
christians and animists of the south who look to black subsaharan 
africa

laurence olivier the foremost actor of his 
generation and leader of the giants of the englishspeaking theater 
died today he was 82 
he died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by friends and 
relatives at his home south of london said his agent laurence 
evans the cause of death was not given 
his last few days were very peaceful said richard olivier 
the actors 27yearold son he died in his sleep at noon 
the son spoke from the family home near the village of ashurst 
50 miles south of london he said a private funeral was planned 
followed by a public memorial service in london 
its hard to think of a world without laurence olivier and now 
its happened and its hard to believe said rosemary harris who 
appeared with olivier in the national theater production of hamlet 
in 1963 and in the film the boys from brazil 
he was the greatest actor of this century said actor anthony 
hopkins who worked with olivier in two films a bridge too far 
and the bounty 
he would hurl himself into the role and that can be quite 
dangerous to limb and body he had tremendous athletic daring 
said hopkins 
charlton heston a friend of olivier who worked with him in the 
1966 film khartoum said from his los angeles home that olivier 
dared to go where few others venture 
flags at the national theater were lowered to halfstaff but no 
shows were canceled that would have been the last thing he would 
have wanted said theater spokesman stephen wood 
oliviers last professional appearance was in the 1988 movie 
war requiem based on the oratorio by composer benjamin britten 
knighted ennobled and revered by the film and theater world he 
was lord olivier when he died one of the very few britons to be 
given a seat in the house of lords for his acting prowess

acclaimed as well as at age 76 his performance for television of 
king lear he was a tragic film hero in wuthering heights and

on television 
at the same time with ferocious will he fought cancer pleurisy 
and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony he endured two 
miserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright 
contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages guilts 
and drinking 
on his 80th birthday tributes flowed during a ceremony at the 
national theater which he founded in 1963 
awe and wonder you gave us awe and wonder actress dame 
peggy ashcroft told him at the time director peter hall called him 
the genius performer 
for olivier life and acting were inseparable i have to act to 
breathe he said 
by turns he loved and hated his craft but never would 
contemplate retiring from it acting simply consumed him 
he was forever searching for new ways to broaden his range and 
reach the hearts of his audience for instance seeking to conjure 
up oedipus abject cry of despair he would imagine the cry of the 
arctic ermine when it licks the salt laid down by its hunters and 
its tongue sticks to the ice 
whatever sex drive he had olivier wrote in his 1982 
autobiography confessions of an actor went into his acting 
you cant be more than one kind of athlete at a time a sexual 
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another

two air force security policemen were 
arrested in the theft of three f16 jet fighter engines after an 
undercover sting identified dozens of people suspected of stealing 
military goods the fbi said today 
indictments have been returned against 12 other people but the 
documents remained sealed in us district court and the fbi refused 
to name them 
the twoyear investigation was aimed at the theft of military 
goods a very lucrative activity in the united states and to some 
extent in utah said robert bryant special agent in charge of 
the agencys utah office 
thefts of military equipment turned up by the investigation 
included sleeping bags helmets canteens munitions and firearms 
as well as the jet engines stolen july 3 from hill air force base 
said us attorney dee benson 
none of the items included military systems or strategic weapons 
he said 
the thefts at hill appear to be part of a larger problem 
involving other states and other military establishments 
unfortunately many of the participants are military policemen and 
we find that especially disturbing benson said 
there was no evidence that the suspects believed they were 
selling the jet engines to a foreign power benson said 
it was just good oldfashioned greed bryant said 
benson identified the men arrested at a restaurant monday night 
as airman 1st class brian roth of ohio and senior airman danny joe 
stroud of kansas no hometowns or ages were immediately available 
benson said he expected many more arrests in coming weeks 
operation punchout a joint effort of the fbi the department 
of defense and the air force targeted hill and other unidentified 
military installations in the salt lake valley bryant said 
the fbi established a storefront operation called military 
surplus brokers in roy near the northern utah base which bought 
thousands of items stolen from all branches of the military bryant 
said 
he said the purchases resulted in the identification of more 
than 100 suspects throughout the united states who are involved in 
the theft and sale of stolen government property 
he said the government spent about 80000 to purchase equipment 
worth about 600000 bryant said the two suspects had been given a 
down payment of 10000 toward a purchase price of 300000 for the 
three pratt amp whitney engines valued at 2 million each 
the engines were reported missing last wednesday by maintenance 
personnel returning from the independence day holiday base 
officials said 
the engines and a towing vehicle were returned to the air force 
on monday from a secret fbi storage facility in salt lake city after 
being processed as evidence fbi agent tim screen said

the lenin shipyard has become a symbol of 
polands difficult fortunes in the postwar era 
rebuilt after world war ii as a model of socialist polands 
possibilities it became famous in 1980 as the birthplace of 
solidarity but was declared inefficient last fall in the nations 
drive for economic reform 
the sprawling yard which president bush visited tuesday has 
been in decline since the late 1970s when it produced a high of 27 
ships yearly and had 15000 employees 
hazardous work and poor living conditions have long made the 
shipyard a hotbed of political and union activity in 1970 security 
police opened fire on workers protesting food price rises killing 
45 according to the official death toll 
ten years later during a strike sparked by the firing of a 
popular crane operator lech walesa scaled a shipyard fence to lead 
what became the first independent trade union in the soviet bloc 
last oct 31 the government said the yard would be closed dec 
1 1989 because it was unprofitable the shipyard employed about 
10000 when the closing was announced 
the shipyard was the first major enterprise to be singled out for 
dismantling by the then monthold government of prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski who had said he would move swiftly to close 
inefficient factories that drain off huge state subsidies 
walesa called the move a personal provocation against the 
birthplace of solidarity 
in the intervening months the communist government increasingly 
aware that it could not control the economy or social unrest without 
solidarity held reform talks with the union and agreed to restore 
its legal status 
on june 4 as poles voted in their freest elections under 
communist rule a polishamerican businesswoman from new jersey 
joined with walesa to announce a plan to save the shipyard 
barbara piasecka johnson heir to the johnson amp johnson 
pharmaceutical fortune pledged up to 100 million to save the 
shipyard 
under the plan not yet finalized mrs johnson and her advisers 
would own 55 percent of the prospective joint venture and the 
management of the staterun enterprise would own 45 percent

minnesota teachers will soon get more of a 
say over who gets to teach with a new law that will put them at the 
head of the class nationally in terms of selfregulation 
a state law effective aug 1 gives teachers a majority of seats 
on the board of teaching which operates independently of the 
department of education 
the board grants licenses sets standards approves college 
programs for teachers and monitors professional conduct 
its not just rearranging the chairs on the titanic said 
bella rosenberg assistant to president albert shanker of the 
american federation of teachers in washington this has gone 
farther than any other legislation weve seen 
she and other advocates of education reform say they hope the law 
will lead to better preparation of new teachers and greater 
accountability for the profession 
a bill signed may 25 by gov rudy perpich reduces the board 
created in 1973 from 15 to 11 members by attrition over the next few 
years while keeping the six members who are teachers 
the rest of the board will be made up of a higher education 
faculty member a school administrator two current or former school 
board members and one person with no connection to education 
the governor appoints all board members bills that failed 
recently in other states gave teacher unions the right to appoint 
board members 
youll be a lighthouse of a new generation said ann mclaren 
program manager of the national education associations instruction 
and professional development division 
the 20000member minnesota federation of teachers and some board 
of teaching members wonder why it took so long to give teachers the 
kind of control over their field that other professions enjoy 
thats been our argument that all other professional boards 
hairdressers and barbers have a majority said jean carlstrom 
vice chairman of the board of teaching and a specialeducation 
teacher because everyones been to school they think theyre an 
authority on education 
the minnesota school boards association opposed the original bill 
but supported the final version because of an amendment giving the 
legislature final say over the creation of any new licensing 
categories 
we thought the public would be well served to keep control of 
that ability to remove licenses and grant licenses for teachers 
said bob meeks the associations associate director for legislative 
services 
unlike doctors and lawyers who regulate their professions 
teachers have a captive audience he said 
the board of teaching already is working on rules to require 
colleges to better prepare teachers to recognize which students need 
special attention carlstrom said it also is considering increasing 
the student teaching requirement to one year from one quarter she 
said 
if this board succeeds in setting high standards and sticking 
to them and helping to rethink the way teachers are prepared it 
will accomplish an enormous amount but thats a very tall order 
rosenberg said 
but she added im optimistic

president bush today made a dramatic 
pilgrimage to the birthplace of the solidarity labor movement and 
told cheering thousands their struggle had produced a time when 
dreams can live again in the democratic transformation of poland 
for those who say that freedom can forever be denied i say let 
them look at poland the president said in the emotional climax of 
a twoday visit 
poland is not alone america stands with you he said 
renewing his pledge to help the poles redeem their shattered economy 
and seek greater political freedoms america stands shoulder to 
shoulder with the polish people in solidarity 
long live bush came back the reply from the crowd of 25000 
people another 25000 lined the streets of this seaport to cheer 
bushs motorcade and some threw flower petals at his limousine 
the president was introduced to the chanting flagwaving 
audience by solidarity leader lech walesa who said he hoped the 
visiting american realized our country should and deserves to be 
helped god bless america may god bless our homeland walesa 
said 
the speech concluded bush and walesa stood together to accept 
the cheers of the crowd then turned to the monument to slain 
workers and held up their hands in a vforvictory sign favored by 
the union movement 
later bush flew to hungary another communist country in the 
throes of extraordinary political and economic reform he travels to 
paris on thursday for the economic summit followed by a trip next 
week to the netherlands 
scrapping his prepared text in budapest bush told the crowd that 
waited in the rain in kossuth square to greet him i salute the 
leaders oif hungary i salute the reforms and change that is taking 
place in this wonderful country 
we want to work with hungary to continue the changes and 
reforms said bush 
after the shipyard speech bush joined communist party leader 
wojciech jaruzelski and laid a wreath at the westerplatte monument 
commemorating where the first shots of world war ii were fired 
at the airport jaruzelski hailed the departing president as an 
experienced and farsighted statesman who attracts warm feelings 
and thanked him for the sincere and partnerlike character of the 
talks we held we have sown new seeds 
bush made the trip to the solidarity workers monument outside the 
main gate to the lenin shipyard after a private lunch at walesas 
home 
the president said walesa had asked for private investment 
assistance in their talks i can give strong support for that 
standing right here in his yard bush said 
later introducing bush at the solidarity monument walesa said 
poland needs help to keep its economic reforms from failing if that 
happened he said it would be a failure of democracy and would 
have a destabilizing effect throughout eastern europe 
on monday bush had outlined a program of 115 million in us 
aid and proposed easier repayment terms for polands 39 billion 
international debt 
he said he would take walesas call for private investment to the 
economic summit starting friday in paris and well see where we 
come out 
shouts of welcome president bush rang out and handheld 
american flags fluttered in the air as the president arrived at the 
monument to polish workers killed in an uprising in 1970 during the 
birth of the labor movement thousands lined the route of his 
motorcade then massed at the monument to hear bushs pledge to 
stand with poland 
bush stressed that hard work and sacrifice are still ahead for 
poles as they try to rebuild their economy 
but his main message was one of help and hope that their 40year 
struggle first against the nazis then against communist 
suppression will realize the ancient dream of freedom and he 
did so by referring to president kennedys dramatic speech at the 
berlin wall 26 years ago 
in grimmer times kennedy had stood outside the barrier between 
east and west and said that if anyone thought communism was the wave 
of the future let them come to berlin 
bush put it this way 
today to those who think that hopes can be forever suppressed 
i say let them look at poland to those who think that freedom can 
be forever denied i say let them look at poland and to those who 
think that dreams can be forever repressed i say let them look at 
poland for here in poland the dream is alive 
it is here in poland where we can work to end the division of 
europe it is in your power to help end the division of europe 
bush said the people of poland can show the world what a free 
people with commitment and energy can accomplish 
walesa and the crowd seemed reluctant to let the president go 
bush urged poles to stay in their country and help with 
rebuilding rather then emigrate as so many thousands have done over 
the years stay with us stay with us they asked him 
standing in walesas backyard after lunch bush said i clearly 
salute his accomplishments toward democratic reforms and want to 
work with him and poland to achieve economic reforms 
walesa who wore a silver solidarity pin on his black tie told 
reporters were not after any loans were after cooperation 
he said that if western banks could open branches in poland with 
10 billion and could strike a good deal in poland that would fix 
our economic problem 
this is what i asked mr president about that was my primary 
appeal and request walesa said 
earlier walesa said in an abctv interview that bushs 115 
million aid proposals dont really help the solidarity leader 
said its just a sort of a drop in the bucket we need shock 
treatment 
the crowd at the solidarity monument which included miners in 
black uniforms with tall feathertopped black hats chanted lech 
walesa lech walesa and solidarity solidarity 
crowned by three crosses topped with anchors the solidarity 
monument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed by 
government security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices in 
which hundreds are believed to have died officially the death toll 
was 45 
earlier during a brief visit to the 14th century oliva cathedral 
in suburban gdansk bush was greeted by several thousand flagwaving 
poles who sang may you live 100 years and tossed red and white 
roses and carnations at his motorcade 
when he left the cathedral for the ride to walesas home the 
president stood on his limousines running board and waved to crowds 
chanting solidarity solidarity

ford says in the august issue of redbook weve escaped from the 
pack from the daily grind the public appoints us to be symbols of 
success 
im very uncomfortable when people stare at me but i think 
ive learned how to deal with that i try to think of those people 
as satisfied customers and thats why theyre approaching me he 
said

tv series as gunsmoke ironside and the virginian and a 
role in the 1970 flop zabriskie point he became a carpenter

didnt hang up his carpenters tools until the 1976 blockbuster

the government asked un forces to 
block a radical south korean student who plans to cross the border 
from north korea as a symbol of national unification news reports 
said tuesday 
the head of south koreas governing party said there will be 
trouble if north korea permits im sukyong to walk through the truce 
village of panmunjom in the demilitarized zone 
park jyunkyu chairman of the governing democratic justice 
party said the action will raise havoc on the present military 
status quo at the military demarcation line that separates the 
two koreas but he did not elaborate 
miss im who in defiance of her government traveled to north 
korea via europe to attend a youth festival said she would enter 
panmunjom on july 27 anniversary of the ceasefire that ended the 
korean war 
the government has said it will arrest miss im 20 on charges of 
national security violations for an illegal trip to north korea but 
newspapers said officials believed the arrest should not take place 
at the border because it could increase political tension 
seoul says dialogue with the communist government in pyongyang 
must be conducted only through government or authorized channels 
the semiofficial south korean news agency yonhap said the 
government has asked the united nations command guarding the border 
to stop miss im at panmunjom where some of the 43000 us troops 
in south korea are garrisoned 
the command highly sensitive to any issue involving politics 
between the nations refused comment on the reports 
under the armistice no one can cross the dmz without prior 
agreement from both sides but if allowed access to the area it 
would be simple to walk from one nation to the other at panmunjom 
because there are few barriers it was not clear how the command was 
expected to stop miss im 
the peninsula was divided into north korea and south korea in 
1945 and the nations fought the 195053 korean war and have 
remained archrivals despite their talks in the past 18 years for 
reconciliation 
park in tokyo on his way back to seoul from a visit to canada 
said he believes the student will return home via other routes 
adding it is north korea who is afraid of breaking the demarcation 
line 
some south korean dissidents and radical students claim seoul is 
insincere in its attempt to seek unification they also demand the 
overthrow of the government of president roh taewoo and withdrawal 
of us troops from south korea saying they hinder unification 
talks 
the only mutually acceptable crossings in the last 36 years have 
been delegates to talks by the two nations and about 150 people from 
each side who took part in a 1985 home visitation program allowing 
koreans on either side to visit relatives

former defense secretary frank c carlucci 
cautioned tuesday against strict protectionist legislation to help 
the declining us defense industry saying the country cant go 
it alone technologically 
if we protect us industries from foreign competition we 
reduce the incentive to invest in modern facilities and advanced 
technologies and we deprive ourselves of access to advances in 
technology being achieved in foreign countries carlucci told the 
senate banking housing and urban affairs committee 
congress is weighing renewal of the defense production act which 
expires sept 30 the 39yearold act gives the federal government 
authority to subsidize industries including those that produce 
goods for the pentagon it also gives the president the power to 
limit or prohibit the acquisition of foreign products 
in the house rep mary rose oakar dohio has introduced an 
amendment that would limit participation of foreign comapanies in 
defense manufacturing and provide financial assistance to 
mediumsize and small defense companies 
recent studies have shown a decline in domestic sources of 
defense production specifically the center for strategic and 
international studies found that from 1987 to 1982 the number of 
companies suppling goods to the defense department dropped from 
118000 to 38000 
adm bobby inman former deputy director of the cia told the 
senate panel that immediate action is necessary because of the 
erosion of the defense industrial base 
i should have put my money into tbills instead of defense 
production activities inman said 
but the former cia official said the house legislation is an 
unwise approach and suggested limiting the use of domesticonly 
suppliers on specific items 
robert b costello former undersecretary for defense 
acquisition told the senate committee that since the us defense 
industry uses foreign parts and technology the pentagon cannot 
arbitrarily ban the use of any foreign supplied material 
carlucci said a move toward protectionism invites retaliation 
it could be disastrous to our national security if we assume we can 
go it alone technologically 
asked by sen john heinz rpa if an presidential advisory 
committee was needed carlucci said such a panel would not solve the 
problem 
the government should take a more active role in encouraging 
adoption of improved manufacturing processess throughout our 
industrial base not just among defense contractors carlucci said 
he also suggested favorable tax policies and longterm investment 
in defense programs

czechoslovak authorities confiscated the 
passports of more than 20 activists including a former foreign 
minister who said on a scandinavian visit that reform in his country 
was too slow emigre sources said tuesday 
the sources in the austrian capital speaking on condition of 
anonymity said czechoslovak officials on july 4 revoked the 
passport of jiri hajek who served as foreign minister during the 
1968 prague spring reform period that was crushed by soviet 
troops 
more than 20 independent activists had their passports 
confiscated last month the sources said 
the norwegian newspaper aftenposten quoted hajek who is also a 
member of the charter 77 human rights group as saying he was told 
the passport was revoked because it wasnt in the interest of the 
state for me to have travel documents and be able to travel abroad 
now 
the emigre sources said hajek appealed the decision 
hajek was told the measure was taken due to interviews granted to 
western media while he was abroad and his attendance at a meeting of 
the socialist international in stockholm june 2022 the sources 
said 
hajek gave a series of interviews to swedish media and held a 
news conference at the airport when he arrived in norway may 11 at 
which he criticized the czechoslovak regime for being slow to 
implement reforms 
he also visited his son who is studying in oslo and is not 
permitted to travel to czechoslovakia 
rut sormova a signatory of the charter 77 human rights manifesto 
and a member of the independent peace association also had her 
passport revoked before a planned visit to spain to attend a 
congress of european peace movements she was then to travel on to 
budapest hungary for an eastwest dialogue the sources said 
two weeks ago authorities seized the passport of the wife of 
dissident playwright vaclav havel she had been planning to visit 
friends in vienna

president bush arrived in hungary today 
to a rainstorm that led him to tear up his opening remarks and tell 
wellwishers i feel the warmth of this welcome and the rain 
doesnt make a darn bit of difference 
bush the first us president ever to visit hungary told the 
crowd in kossuth square we have in our country a special 
affection and feeling for the people of hungary 
in his meetings with hungarian leaders bush said i will be 
bringing them the warm greetings from the american people and the 
convictions of the people of the united states that we must work 
with hungary we want to work with hungary to continue the changes 
and the reforms going forward in your great country 
bush said he scrapped his opening speech and decided to speak 
from the heart because the crowd had been out in the rain too 
long 
youll have to listen to me tomorrow im sure at some drier 
time and some drier place he said adding 
long after this rain is gone i am going to remember the warmth 
of the welcome from the people of hungary 
on kossuth square workers had to hastily repair wind damage 
caused by a fierce thunderstorm that turned the sky pitch black 75 
minutes before air force one landed at ferihegy airport 
one bannr hoisted in the square by an antigovernment group said 
dont give money to communists 
as president bruno f straub greeted bush at some length the 
us president drew warm applause for helping wife barbara into a 
raincoat 
straub told bush hungary is convinced that his visit means his 
countrys current reforms have the sympathy and support of the 
american people and noted that international relations had 
improved since bushs visit as vice president in 1983 
then straub said eastwest relations were characterized by an 
almost total lack of eastwest dialogue 
now he noted hungary is getting similar words of 
encouragement from east and west alike and we do need these very 
much 
the welcoming ceremony took place on a large square near the 
danube river named after lajos kossuth the hero of hungarys failed 
1848 revolt against its then austrian rulers 
kossuth is a symbol both of the nations long fight for freedom 
and its affection for the united states where kossuth was hailed as 
a hero during an 185152 visit kossuth was an orator of reknown 
and abraham lincoln reportedly borrowed some of his words for the 
gettysburg address 
bush journeyed here from poland his next stop on thursday is 
paris for the economic summit followed by a visit to the 
netherlands monday and tuesday before returning to washington

corporate raider t boone pickens jr told 
congress tuesday the japanese are resisting his foray into corporate 
ownership there to prevent him from exposing a closed monopolistic 
economy 
the millionaire texas oilman known for his often hostile raids 
on us companies purchased a 202 percent stake in koito 
manufacturing co an automobile lighting company for 800 million 
but he was rebuffed two weeks ago at a shareholders meeting in 
tokyo when he sought three seats on koitos 20member board 
pickens said he poses no threat to the companys management 
because the web of interconnected stockholders including koitos 
customers can easily outvote him 
they must want to exclude me so that an american wont see how 
their cartel works they dont want their system exposed for what it 
is pickens told the senate committee on commerce science and 
transportation 
in fact he said the japanese may be exporting their system of 
close links between companies and suppliers when they build 
factories in the united states 
american suppliers are already complaining that they cannot get 
a piece of the action he said 
sen ernest f hollings dsc chairman of the panel and a 
strong advocate of an aggressive trade policy praised pickens for 
having given the committee a wonderful understanding of the 
barriers japan erects to outside investment 
this is a matter of policy they try to finesse it with the 
word culture theyve got the same culture you and ive got 
money talks hollings said 
pickens testimony came as the committee considered a bill 
sponsored by sen tom harkin diowa and rep john bryant 
dtexas it would require foreign investors to register with the 
department of commerce when they purchase more than a 5 percent 
stake in a us company or real estate valued at more than 5 
million 
according to a report issued by the commerce department in june 
foreign holdings in the united states have tripled since 1980 to 
179 trillion 533 billion more than americans own abroad making 
the united states the worlds largest debtor 
great britain held the largest stake in the united states 
followed by japan and the netherlands 
harkin said under the current system of tracking foreign 
investment it is often impossible to determine the true ownership of 
individual companies and properties ownership is often cloaked 
through shell corporations under the current system of tracking and 
harkin said he fears some of the investment represents recycled drug 
profits 
he also said the government needs better information to determine 
whether or not foreigners are acquiring too much control over 
strategic industries such as oil and chemicals 
commerce undersecretary michael r darby said the harkinbryant 
bill would compromise the anonymity of foreign firms reporting 
information to the us government and discourage foreign 
investment which the administration welcomes because it helps 
modernize us industry 
enactment of this proposal would ultimately increase the cost 
of capital in the us and result in slower economic growth weaker 
productivity performance lower rates of employment and american 
products which are less competitive in world markets he said 
darby said the administration prefers with some adjustments a 
bill sponsored by sen frank h murkowski ralaska which imposes 
no new reporting requirements but provides for more sharing among 
government agencies of currently collected data 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the influential national 
association of manufacturers said his lobby group also opposes the 
harkinbryant measure he said he did not believe it would give us 
negotiators any leverage to lower japanese barriers 
pickens supported the bill saying he was required to file an 
extensive report with the japanese government before he purchased 
his share of koito

britain mourned laurence olivier with tributes and 
fond memories tuesday and theaters from londons west end to the 
birthplace of shakespeare lowered their flags and ordered their 
lights doused for an hour 
queen elizabeth ii sent condolences to oliviers family who were 
at the actors bedside when he died peacefully at the age of 82 at 
his home in the village of ashurst 
prime minister margaret thatcher praised his extraordinary 
talents and remembered her favorite olivier roles in hamlet 
henry v and richard iii 
we are taking out all display lights in our theaters from 9 
pm to 10 pm as a measure of respect for the death of a national 
institution said louis benjamin head of a 12theater group in 
the west end londons equivalent of broadway 
the national theater of which olivier was a founding father 
lowered its flags removed its normal playbill from its electronic 
billboard overlooking the river thames and replaced it with 
laurence olivier 19071989 
no shows were canceled however that would have been the last 
thing he would have wanted said theater spokesman stephen wood 
flags also were lowered at theaters in stratford birthplace of 
shakespeare whose works olivier defined for modern mass audiences 
it isnt too much to say that olivier was perhaps the greatest 
man of the theater ever said sir peter hall who succeeded 
olivier as head of the national theater in 1973 larry oliviers 
genius shaped the last 50 years 
actor sir richard attenborough said he was above the crowd he 
was a lion of a man 
rosemary harris who had several stage and screen roles opposite 
olivier said its hard to think of a world without laurence 
olivier 
some remarked on his physical courage actor anthony hopkins 
remembered his capacity to electrify people he would hurl himself 
into the role and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body he 
had tremendous athletic daring 
hopkins also praised oliviers openness to new young talents 
i remember him telling me never be afraid to be outrageous 
he said you will always be shot down in flames because people 
are going to dislike you whatever you do it is your fear of being 
criticized that stops you being outrageous 
denis quilley who acted with olivier in the 1971 production of 
eugene oneills long days journey into night recalled how 
night after night audiences would gasp in shock as olivier already 
64 threw himself backward off a table 
british tv personality melvyn bragg one of the last to interview 
olivier extensively said he was as english as his own vicarage 
family a man of a thousand faces a powerful dangerous and sexy 
presence on every stage and in some memorable films 
olivier dies cried the newsbills and evening newspapers sold 
fast when rushhour commuters saw the headline 
he was a very great actor of extraordinary power said 
michael denton a physician whenever i thought of him or heard 
his name i saw his stooped figure in black as richard iii 
pat fairbairn a civil servant standing in line for a bus said 
olivier summed up the english theater he had that lovely 
dignified voice 
what impressed me was that his professional colleagues always 
spoke of him with such great respect and admiration fairbairn 
said when they played shakespeare it always seemed to me that 
they were tying to live up to olivier 
joanne james a young london actress looked crushed when she 
heard the news im sad she said hes been a symbol to 
everybody with the energy and dedication he has put into the 
theater ive grown up with him

housing secretary jack kemp today pledged 
zero tolerance for thievery and influence peddling at the 
scandalridden department of housing and urban development that he 
inherited this year 
what i could not anticipate three months ago was the extent to 
which i had inherited a legacy of abuse and mismanagement fraud and 
favoritism in certain hud programs kemp said in testimony before 
a congressional panel 
kemp was warmly received by his former colleagues in the house 
unlike all the other witnesses who have appeared before the panel in 
its hud investigation he was not asked to testify under oath 
kemp denounced the practice that prevailed during the reagan 
administration when developers hired wellknown republicans to act 
as consultants to help secure hud funds to fix up housing for 
the poor he said that practice helped inflate the cost of the 
projects 
that extra money goes for excess profits for the developer and 
clearly to cover consultant fees he said 
developers and consultants testifying before congress all have 
denied that taxpayers money was used to pay their fees sometimes 
in six figures 
the department of housing and urban development will maintain a 
policy of zero tolerance for violations of our standards of 
conduct kemp told the house government operations subcommittee on 
housing and employment 
in addition to influence peddling federal investigators are 
looking into the possible theft of as much as 20 million by a dozen 
private closing agents around the country who failed to hand over 
money to the government they collected for the sale of foreclosed 
properties 
one such agent marilyn harrell of maryland has publicly 
confessed taking more than 5 million but said she gave some of it 
to the poor earning her the nickname robin hud 
people who steal from this program are not robin hood type 
heroes as some have protrayed them and they arent robbing the 
rich kemp said they are stealing from the taxpayer and 
depriving low and moderate income people of the opportunity to 
realize the american dream of home ownership 
hud meanwhile has reassigned four employees of its washington 
field office pending investigations of their role in apparent 
mismanagement that officials believe cost the government about 10 
million 
that investigation is part of a kempordered review of virtually 
all major hud programs 
kemp has suspended three hud programs and said last week there 
may be more suspensions as he examines the agencys operations 
he has promised he will not use huds problems to curtail the 
federal governments role in housing 
i think kemp is going to do the right thing by and large 
said rep barney frank dmass the big thing is that we have 
somebody in there who cares about the programs instead of waging an 
allout war on the programs 
the congressional investigation of hud may expand to the senate 
where the banking committee plans a thursday vote on whether to 
launch its own inquiry 
the four washington field office workers who were reassigned 
including the offices former director will be placed for up to 90 
days in nonmanagement positions at four separate offices at hud 
headquarters agency spokesman robert nipp said monday 
the four were placed on 30day administrative leave at the start 
of the investigation last month that period expired monday and hud 
officials decided to give the four 90day temporary assignments as 
the investigation continues 
an audit of the washington field office uncovered lax financial 
and management controls that allowed private closing agents hired by 
hud to handle singlefamily property to delay payments to the 
government and in some cases not make them at all 
the four workers are i margaret white who had headed the 
district field office for five years robert b warner its director 
of housing management charles w womble a loan specialist in the 
singlefamily home divisions and everett rothschild who headed the 
field offices property disposition division 
the field office oversees hud properties in the district of 
columbia and parts of maryland and virginia

oil inside the hull of the crippled tanker exxon 
valdez washed away by the sea was the likely source of a 10mile 
oil sheen off the southern california coast a coast guard official 
said today 
concern about the offshore oil slick and the discovery of five 
flaps of steel hanging from the bottom of the tanker will delay the 
disabled tankers entry into san diego bay at least several days 
preliminary results of test samples taken from the oil slick have 
not yet confirmed that the oil came from the tanker said us coast 
guard cmdr jack scarborough captain of the port of san diego 
however scarborough said exxon officials agreed that the exxon 
valdez was the likely source 
although exxon officials had maintained the inside of the tanker 
was thoroughly cleaned before it began the journey from valdez 
scarborough said they were wrong the ship is not squeaky clean 
thats a discrepancy i cant explain 
the oil slick today was about 10 miles long and 25 yards wide 
scarborough said smaller than the 18milelong sheen visible from 
the air monday 
because oil floats officials planned to flood the tankers cargo 
tanks with seawater pushing the residual oil up inside the vessel 
scarborough said 
once the leaking oil problem has been resolved the tanker can be 
brought in to calm waters so divers can repair the flaps of steel 
hanging as much as 40 feet beneath the tanker 
the ship that spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil off alaska 
was about 50 miles southwest of point loma today scarborough said 
the tanker moved slowly under its own power while coast guard 
officials reviewed test results of samples taken from the oil in the 
ocean coast guard lt larry solberg said 
shes not going anywhere solberg said of the tanker weve 
told them they cant come any closer 
exxon shipping co spokeswoman carrie chassin said she was not 
sure when the valdez would be cleared to dock 
the 987foot ship damaged march 24 when it smashed into a reef 
in alaskas prince william sound is to be repaired at national 
steel and shipbuilding co where it was built in 1986 
the tanker under tow since leaving alaska on june 23 had an 
uneventful trip until the final leg of its 2500mile journey 
during the coast guards inspection an underwater camera showed 
that five metal plates had peeled away from the hull and were 
hanging from the frame 
the loose steel increased the vessels draft to as much as 65 
feet making it impossible for it to travel through a san diego bay 
channel averaging 40 feet in depth solberg said 
this all happened in transit he said it wasnt this way 
when they left there are pieces of the steel shell plating the 
hull itself that have basically been torn away due to the wave 
action 
also monday officials downgraded the amount of oil spilled when 
a greek tanker ran aground june 23 off newport ri to onefifth 
the original estimate of 16 million gallons 
in boston gary ott of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said less than 300000 gallons of no 2 heating oil 
spilled from the world prodigy off rhode island 
officials said the initial estimates were wrong because the 
remaining oil from the tanker was mixed with water when it was 
removed 
in philadelphia the captain and eight crew members of a 
uruguayan tanker that spilled more than 300000 of heavy heating oil 
into the delaware river on june 24 tested negative for drugs their 
lawyer raymond letulle said monday the urine tests were taken the 
day after the spill he said 
the coast guard boarded the presidente rivera right after the 
accident and saw no evidence that there was any problem with 
alcohol letulle said

the state department accused the nicaraguan 
government of harassing reporters opposition figures and observers 
and called for a halt so elections set for next year can be 
credible a department spokesman said tuesday 
spokesman richard boucher said the united states is very 
concerned about the way things are going in nicaragua where 
elections are scheduled for february 
sandinista harassment of the press the opposition and 
observers whether done through brute force or through the use of 
transparent legalisms must cease if the elections scheduled for 
february 1990 are to command respect both within nicaragua and 
internationally boucher said at a regular briefing 
we urge the sandinistas to reconsider their current course of 
action he said 
nicaragua and other central american nations signed a peace 
accord calling for the elections last february under the agreement 
the usbacked contra rebels opposed to the sandinistas are to be 
abolished 
boucher cited three recent instances in nicaragua that he said 
were inconsistent with the sandinistas professed commitment to 
a pluralistic society 
first he said a sandinista mob attacked two correspondents from 
la prensa with rocks and rotten eggs on june 20 in the city of leon 
on july 7 the sandinistas expelled nicaraguanborn antonio 
ibarra rojas a sociology professor at dubuque university in iowa 
who had come to managua as an electoral observer on behalf of 
freedom house a human rights group 
finally boucher said the sandinistas denied permission to the 
united nicaraguan opposition to hold a march in the city of ocotal 
on the grounds that uno is not a political party 
the united nicaraguan opposition of course is the umbrella 
organization of democratic parties from right to left which oppose 
sandinista repression boucher said 
he refused to say whether the sandinistas recent actions could 
jeopardize an agreement on aid to the contras forged this spring 
between congress and the white house the issue is likely to surface 
this fall in congress he said 
the bush admninistration in a break with the previous 
administration worked out a compromise with congress to give the 
contras 498 million in nonmilitary aid 
while forgoing military assistance to the rebels president bush 
put the ball in the sandinistas court saying that regime must 
honestly comply with promises to encourage democracy and freedom 
last month nicaraguas foreign minister miguel descoto 
accused the united states of spreading systematic lies to 
discredit nicaragua and its preparations for free elections in 1990

well as blacks and other minorities are newly threatened young said 
we now face a situation where the supreme court is attempting 
to reverse affirmative action the mayor said i think we need a 
mighty coalition of protest in america 
quoting benjamin franklins statement at the signing of the

a group of azerbaijanis were ambushed tuesday 
apparently by armenians and two were shot and killed as ethnic 
rioting flared anew in the troubled southern region of 
nagornokarabakh tass said 
in a separate incident soldiers trying to clear roads around 
stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh were pelted by 
stones and shot at with hunting rifles and 19 suffered injuries 
tass said 
nagornokarabakh is predominantly armenian and christian 
although it is located within the predominantly moslem republic of 
azerbaijan 
in the ambush near the village of kirkidzhan on the outskirts of 
stepanakert two azerbaijanis wer shot to death and a third was 
seriously wounded tass said although tass did not identify the 
attackers the ambush apparently was the work of armenians 
the report said tension was continuing to rise in the caucasian 
mountain enclave which for nearly two years has been the scene of 
sharp conflict between the armenian majority and azerbaijanis 
interior ministry troops and police were on alert in the region 
with troops patrolling in cars and helicopters tass said 
on monday unidentified people had tried to block roads in the 
region and that clashes of large groups of population with the 
use of firearms and bottles filled with incendiary liquid became 
more frequent tass said 
on tuesday in stepanakert armenians blockaded streets with iron 
plates and telegraph poles and in the village of khodzhali 
azerbaijanis built barricades of cars it said 
interior ministry soldiers trying to clear roads in the area 
around stepanakert were pelted by stones from the crowd and fired 
upon with hunting rifles and 19 were injured 
azerbaijanis near the regional administrative center of askeran 
stopped a police car and tried to seize the officers weapons the 
news agency said one of the officers was injured in the struggle 
before another police detail restored order it said 
the strife in nagornokarabakh began when the armenian population 
there and in neighboring republic of armenia began protesting 
because the largely moslem republic of azerbaijan administered the 
enclave 
officials in moscow sought to defuse the tension by creating a 
commission to exercise administative control of nagornokarabakh in 
january but the troubles have continued 
a commission on nagornokarabakh established by the new congress 
of peoples deputies will review seven proposed solutions for the 
ethnic conflict government officials have said 
on may 9 authorities took further steps to curb the unrest by 
lengthening the curfew there

the world jewish congress which opened 
its first office in a communist country this week could open one in 
the soviet union within two years said the groups president said 
tuesday 
edgar m bronfman also said his talks with hungarian leaders 
convinced him they are committed to transforming the country into a 
democracy 
the new office opened monday in the hungarian capital with a 
staff of five is designed to work with hungarys 80000 jews and 
with the small jewish populations in other east european countries 
outside the soviet union 
my guess is that the wjc will have an office in the soviet 
union within the next two years bronfman told reporters we 
would like to open up an office in the soviet union because there 
are so many jews there 
bronfman said the soviet jews estimated to number anywhere from 
18 million to 3 million would first have to become more organized 
and join the world jewish congress to clear the way for the office 
in moscow 
he also said that while an office had been agreed upon in 
principle with the kremlin the timing still was not certain 
the situation in the soviet union has improved enormously as 
far as the jewish population is concerned both in terms of cultural 
and religious freedom and in terms of emigration bronfman said 
after years of thwarting such emigration the soviet union has 
begun allowing thousands of jews to leave each year 
bronfman met with various hungarian leaders including premier 
miklos nemeth and minister of state imre pozsgay during his 
threeday visit to budapest 
its clear that they want this country to become a democracy 
bronfman said speaking just hours before the scheduled arrival of 
president bush 
bronfman continued they are very anxious to have a lot of 
capital investment they dont expect any debt forgiveness 
hungary with a population of 105 million people has a nearly 
crushing foreign debt of 17 billion 
earlier tuesday bronfman received a government award in 
recognition of his efforts to promote hungarianamerican relations

two air force policemen were charged with 
stealing three f16 engines and 12 other people were indicted in a 
sting in which fbi agents ran a military surplus store dealing in 
stolen property authorities said tuesday 
agents have identified up to 100 suspects some military 
policemen at hill air force base other utah installations and 15 
other communities in the west and southwest said robert bryant 
agent in charge of the fbis utah office 
the indictments remained sealed in federal court and the names of 
the people were not released 
the thefts at hill appear to be part of a larger problem 
involving other states and other military establishments said 
us attorney dee benson 
unfortunately many of the participants are military policemen 
and we find that especially disturbing 
benson identified the two men arrested at a bountiful restaurant 
monday night as airman 1st class brian roth of chesterland ohio 
and senior airman danny joe stroud of newton kan their ages were 
not released 
benson said he expected many more arrests in coming weeks 
operation punchout a joint effort of the fbi the department of 
the defense and the air force began in 1986 when stolen military 
goods became increasingly available in the salt lake valley bryant 
said 
it targeted military and civilian personnel as well as 
unscrupulous wholesalers of stolen goods he said 
the fbi established a storefront in roy near the base called 
military surplus brokers which spent about 80000 to buy thousands 
of items worth about 600000 stolen from all branches of the 
military bryant said 
benson said the stolen military equipment included sleeping bags 
helmets canteens munitions and firearms as well as the jet 
engines although no military systems or strategic weapons were 
involved 
he said the purchases resulted in the identification of more 
than 100 suspects throughout the united states who are involved in 
the theft and sale of stolen government property 
he said roth and stroud had approached undercover officers with 
an offer to sell the jet fighter engines the two were given a down 
payment of 10000 toward a purchase price of 300000 for the three 
engines valued at 2 million each he said 
the two men brought the engines to the fbi agents by trailer 
both were charged with theft of government property and 
conspiracy they were jailed without bail 
the pratt amp whitney f100pw200 engines were reported missing 
last wednesday by maintenance personnel returning from the 
independence day holiday 
bryant said between 25 percent and 30 percent of those believed 
involved are active military personnel but none of them was a 
highranking officer 
he said there was no evidence the suspects believed they were 
selling the jet engines to a foreign power nor that they were 
linked to thefts at other bases 
it was just good oldfashioned greed bryant said 
wayne hufnagel commander of the office of special investigations 
at lowry air force base in colorado said the operation was known to 
several base commanders and that military equipment was permitted to 
be taken off the installations in order not to compromise the 
investigaion 
the jet engines each are about 17 feet long and weigh 3200 
pounds

a house subcommittee drafting a foreign aid 
bill broke up in bitter partisan dispute tuesday after its 
democratic chairman complained republicans were not going along with 
a compromise worked out with the bush administration 
rep david obey dwis had proposed a compromise to the 143 
billion money bill for the fiscal year that begins this oct 1 
shifting 166 million into categories the administration wants 
primarily military aid to friendly countries 
but as the meeting of the appropriations committees foreign 
operations panel began rep jerry lewis rcalif asked to be 
allowed to offer an amendment that would cut development aid to 
china through the international development association 
obey seeing the move as an effort to score political points at 
the expense of democrats reacted angrily unless we have 
bipartisan agreement we dont have any intention of supporting the 
agreement worked out with the administration its just that 
simple 
ranking gop subcommittee member mickey edwards of oklahoma his 
voice rising said obey was asking for too much there would be no 
gag rule he declared you can play games all you want 
responded obey if i buy this amendment i want to know what it 
gets us obey later adjourned the meeting indefinitely and told 
reporters he was tired of taking the heat for pushing an unpopular 
bill which the white house wants far more than does congress 
the bill in dispute appropriates money for the full range of us 
foreign aid programs for the coming year from subsidies for 
military equipment purchases to aid for health and development in 
the third world 
at the same time the senate foreign relations committee failed 
for the fifth time to muster a quorum needed to take action on its 
own foreign aid bill which would set the policies under which the 
aid money would be spent 
committee chairman claiborne pell dri said he would try 
again wednesday to get enough senators together so the measure could 
be sent to the full senate

the legislature voted tuesday to allow students 
drafted into the red army to be discharged before they complete 
their twoyear service tass reported 
the move was seen as another step to scale back the soviet 
military 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov proposed the measure and it was met 
by a storm of applause unprecedented in the new soviet 
parliament the official news agency said 
the supreme soviet decreed that 175000 students will be relieved 
of military service in the next two months 
the step had been suggested by legislators speaking to the 
supreme soviets parent body the congress of peoples deputies 
which met may 25 to june 9 
it was an expansion on plans tass announced april 11 for students 
to serve only one year in the military instead of 18 months in the 
army and air force or two years in the navy 
the defense ministry had announced in march that students could 
defer military service until after graduation 
previously all soviet men between the ages of 18 and 25 were 
eligible for the draft and there were no exemptions for students 
tass did not give a vote for the supreme soviets approval of the 
discharge it was the first lawmaking action the new body has taken 
since it went into session june 10 the supreme soviet had been 
focusing on reviewing the candidates ryzhkov nominated for his 
cabinet 
president mikhail s gorbachev has taken several steps since 
coming to power in 1985 to decrease military spending and reduce the 
soviet arsenal in december he announced that soviet troops would 
be cut by 500000 and military spending would be reduced by 14 
percent 
gorbachevs reductions would cut the soviet armed forces to 
3760000 the united states has about 213 million men and women in 
active duty

the house on tuesday urged president bush to 
pressure private us and foreign banks to negotiate larger debt 
forgiveness agreements with mexico 
the action on a 33177 vote was a reaffirmation of a plan 
introduced earlier this year by treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
the reduction should be big enough to allow mexico to achieve a 
sufficiently positive rate of economic growth to ensure the 
maintenance of social and economic stability according to the 
nonbinding resolution 
the house action also urged us banking regulators the federal 
reserve board and the comptroller of the currency to make banks 
set aside more reserves for covering impaired foreign debt 
mexico and its 15 main creditor private banks said over the 
weekend that they are close to reaching an agreement in principle on 
a package that could reduce mexicos debt service costs by 3 
billion a year 
mexico asked for a 55 percent reduction in the 54 billion it 
owes private lenders about 15 billion of it to us banks after 
brady unveiled his third world debt relief plan in march 
the banks led by citicorp manufacturers hanover and chemical 
bank in new york and bank of america in san francisco have offered 
a 35 percent reduction if the world bank and international monetary 
fund guarantee interest payments on the remaining balance 
bradys plan offers private banks governmentbacked guarantees 
they will be paid interest on the remaining balance if they 
voluntarily reduce the debt third world countries owe them 
the mexican deal is going to be the model for implementation of 
the brady plan said rep john lafalce dny

cuban leaders apparently are standing firm in 
their decision to send a war hero and three other former army 
officers to the firing squad for drug trafficking despite 
international pleas for clemency 
cubas traditional enemies would also criticize us if we dont 
shoot them saying we dont make an example of those involved in 
international drug trade said carlos rafael rodriguez vice 
president of the council of state 
the official cuban news agency prensa latina which carried his 
comments also said the cuban masses support sundays vote by 
president fidel castro and the 28 other members of the council to 
uphold the death penalty for former gen arnaldo ochoa 
it was very painful but it is a very traitorous crime that 
must be punished with the maximum penalty the news agency quoted 
vilma espin president of the federation of cuban women as saying 
the news agency has not yet said when the sentences would be 
carried out or whether castro who for years angrily denied us 
charges that cuba was a way station for drugs could grant a 
reprieve 
pope john paul ii asked cuban authorities for clemency for ochoa 
and the three others the vatican said tuesday 
ochoa col antonio de la guardia maj armando padron and capt 
jorge martinez were convicted by a courtmartial last week of 
helping smuggle tons of cocaine and shiploads of marijuana into the 
united states 
ten other officers were convicted in the case which also 
involved smuggling of diamonds ivory and dollars and sentenced to 
terms ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison 
defense minister raul castro called drugs a capitalist plague and 
said cuba must purge itself of corrosive conduct 
it be would better for our beloved and beautiful island to sink 
into the sea like the legendary atlantis rather than succumb again 
to capitalisms corruptions the presidents brother said 
failing to apply the maximum punishment to ochoa and his 
collaborators would be setting an ominous precedent of impunity 
he said 
the arrests and trial constituted the biggest scandal to hit cuba 
since fidel castro came to power jan 1 1959 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the united states is still assessing the dramatic developments 
that have taken place in cuba over the last three weeks involving 
the drug scandal 
if the cuban government is indeed serious about efforts to 
combat narcotics we welcome its contribution if on the other 
hand traffic continues unimpeded in the wake of the trial of ochoa 
and others then we would question the cuban governments commitment 
to the antidrug struggle 
were adopting a waitandsee attitude to see if the cuban 
governments deeds match its words he said 
raul castro said he had given ochoa broad powers as commander of 
cuban troops in angola in 1987 and 1988 and recalled how ochoa had 
invoked those powers to sentence three cuban soldiers to death for 
murdering some angolans 
ochoa 57 fought alongside the castro brothers in cubas rugged 
mountains during the revolution that overthrew dictator fulgencio 
batista he went on to become a trusted aide who carried out 
confidential missions for the president 
he was named a hero of the republic one of only five cuban 
officers ever so honored for his field service in angola and 
ethiopia 
all 14 defendants in the case were officers of the cuban armed 
forces or held high positions in the security staff of the interior 
ministry they were stripped of all rank and decorations last month 
and dishonorably discharged

more than 50000 people gave president bush 
a heros welcome tuesday at the workers monument where solidarity 
was born in a wave of labor upheaval america stands with you 
bush said 
they chanted stay with us and long live bush during an 
emotional rally just outside the lenin shipyard after solidarity 
leader lech walesa asked bush to amplify a 115 million us aid 
plan with his support for a 10 billion privateinvestment rescue 
package 
about 25000 people were packed in around the monument while at 
least an equal number lined the 25 miles of streets as bushs 
motorcade drove from a lunch at the home of walesa to the yard 
an interpreter for mrs bush quoted walesa as telling the crowd 
there have been many demonstrations in this place and i have 
never in my whole life seen anything like this 
bush paid homage to polish workers who have struggled since 1970 
for freedom and a better life contributing to the dramatic 
democratic reforms now taking place in the country 
walesa hosted a homestyle private lunch for the president and 
raised the possibility of even more aid to poland by western nations 
than the 115 million announced by bush on monday 
solidarity argues that the help is needed to ensure that public 
unrest does not upset the delicate progress toward democracy but it 
agrees any aid should have tight controls on it so it is not wasted 
as it was in the past 
after bushs departure for budapest walesas spokesman issued a 
statement quoting walesa as saying the six points the president 
presented in parliament were an important idea but adding 
we hope that these will not be the only sums and projects we 
especially count on this after the paris summit referring to the 
economic summit of seven industrial nations that begins friday 
in his speech at the workers monument outside the shipyard 
three soaring steelplated crosses topped by anchors bush invoked 
the spirit of president john f kennedys 1963 speech at the berlin 
wall 
to those who think that freedom can be forever denied i say 
let them look at poland bush said 
to those who think that dreams can be forever repressed i say 
let them look at poland 
today the brave workers of gdansk stand beside this monument as 
a beacon of hope a symbol of that dream and the brave workers of 
gdansk know poland is not alone america stands with you 
the phrase brought a roar of applause and renewed chants of 
long live bush 
the president repeated throughout the visit that the united 
states was willing to help poland but that poles themselves must 
accept further sacrifice 
bush sought to inspire his listeners telling them that poles who 
came to american built a better life in one generation and they 
could do the same too this time at home in poland 
if he was a young pole he added he would remain at home and not 
emigrate 
stay with us stay with us the crowd chanted back to bush 
amid laughter 
before taking leave of the workers bush and walesa together 
faced the monument and raised their arms in a v for victory a 
sign used by solidarity 
the president rounded out his visit to poland with one last 
meeting and farewell from polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
we have sown new seeds jaruzelski told bush i am 
convinced this visit will contribute to the development of 
comprehensive bilateral cooperation 
an official commentary issued by the pap news agency declared the 
visit a success of both sides sealing the return of normal 
uspolish relations after the breakdown of the martiallaw years 
in the early 1980s

about 4000 evangelical christians 
opened a conference tuesday to forge new strategies for spreading 
the faith in a rapidly changing world 
the goal is to preach to everyone in the world by the end of this 
century and try to take advantage of political changes such as 
liberalization in the soviet union and the growth of the faith in 
developing countries 
delegates to the 10day convention dubbed lausanne ii after 
a similar gathering in lausanne switzerland in 1974 represented 
191 countries making it one of the largest gatherings of its kind 
organizers said 
in a keynote address the rev leighton ford chairman of the 
lausanne committee that is sponsoring the conference said the 
evangelical movement was facing new opportunities 
now we wait expectantly to see what the new openness and 
longing for freedom in our world as shown in the spirit of 
glasnost and the events in china will mean for the future of the 
gospel said ford a canadian 
ford said he welcomed delegates from the soviet union poland 
czechoslovakia hungary east germany romania cuba mozambique and 
other communist countries to the convention 
but another official said the soviet delegation had not arrived 
and that the list of those who are in manila has not been finalized 
ford also noted an increase in interest in evangelism among major 
christian denominations 
now we do not hear the word moratorium and many of these 
same historic churches are rethinking the need for agressive 
missionary outreach and some have called for the 90s to be a decade 
of evangelism said ford a brotherinlaw of the american 
evangelist the rev billy graham 
graham was set to speak at the manila conference but commitments 
in london prevented him from coming organizers said 
ford said that by the year 2000 world evangelicals should be 
able to reach 25 billion people who have not heard the gospel 
he also cited the increase in the number of missionaries from 
developing countries and the need to face economic and social issues 
in spreading the faith 
then our world was not quite so clearly aware of the 
troubles in northern ireland or of apartheid in south africa 
where the gospel has been wrapped in the sectarian robes of race and 
power ford said now we are aware and we stand with our 
brothers and sisters in those areas where they seek to faithfully 
live and speak for chirst 
he told the delegates they must find ways to make the faith 
attractive to people in widely differing parts of the world 
indians see christs peace in a way that englishmen dont 
brazilians see it in a way that nigerians dont pacific islanders 
see it in a way that germans dont ford said but as we focus 
on these next 10 days on christ we may learn to procalim his peace 
as he did 
earlier thomas wang lausanne ii international director said 
continued suffering has helped in the steady growth of christian 
churches in china since the worlds most populous country fell under 
communist rule in 1949 
suffering is one of the important reasons for churches to 
grow said wang and american i believe that has been the main 
reason for the chinese churches to grow from 800000 members in 1949 
to 50 million today 
china forced a halt to religious activity during the 196676 
cultural revolution but since has allowed churches to reopen 
wang said some 300 chinese church representatives had been 
expected to attend the manila conference but chinas crackdown on 
the democracy movement has made it virtually impossible for chinese 
to obtain exit visas 
wang said he expected seven chinese church leaders who already 
were outside china when the crackdown began to attend

the thunderstorm that soaked crowds 
waiting to see president bush left some hungarians with no glimpse 
of him at all including a military honor guard that had stood at 
attention through a driving rain but was bypassed by the 
presidential entourage 
nobody told us a damned thing fumed a militarty officer who 
asked not to be named 
for at least 10 minutes of driving rain the guard had waited in 
front of a redcarpeted reviewing stand for bush to review the 
troops after speaking in lajos kossuth square 
but bush discarded his planned speech spoke briefly to thank the 
thousands of hungarians for braving the hurricanelike winds that 
preceded his arrival and then was whisked to his limousine for a 
ride of a few hundred yards to a side entrance of the nearby 
parliament building for a state dinner 
others who had braved the rains shared the honor guards 
frustration as bush abandoned the second half of the planned 
welcoming ceremonies 
indeed thousands of wellwishers had positioned themselves for 
the military review the playing of the us and hungarian anthems 
and the formal presentation of flowers 
after bushs limousine whisked by many in the crowd rushed to 
the front entrance of parliament in a futile effort to catch a 
glimpse of the president who was already inside 
hungarian military officials scurried around trying to find out 
whether the program had been changed and finally one agitated 
officer ordered the honor guard to march away 
despite the abrupt change in plans hungarians were still 
delighted that bush had come 
it was well worth waiting in the rain said agnes varnai a 
young budapest advertising worker this was a good thing it will 
take a few days for it to sink in

there are karate shoes and volleyball shoes 
skateboarding shoes and cheerleading shoes now syringes washing 
onto beaches are boosting sales of the latest entry in the athletic 
footwear market the water shoe 
the 25to60 anklehigh mesh and rubber booties are light 
enough for swimming but have tough soles to protect against hot 
sand barnacles shells coral or the occasional jagged test 
tube encrusted with blood 
despite their price two to six times the cost of ordinary 
flipflops the shoes are reported by retailers and mailorder 
houses to be selling fast especially in florida texas southern 
california and new england 
theyve caught on really fast said kristi pike a floor 
supervisor for eastern mountain sports in boston people see other 
people wearing them on the beach and come in to ask for them 
nike originally developed its aqua sock as a superlight running 
shoe but what bombed among runners scored an immediate hit among 
windsurfers when it reemerged two years ago in a modified shape and 
neon colors 
we really thought there was going to be a narrow market for 
it said liz g dolan a spokeswoman for the beaverton ore 
company now were in a situation where we really cannot make them 
fast enough 
plenty of industry analysts believe the water shoe could outrun 
the football shoe which is projected to generate 50 million in 
sales this year and perhaps climb as high as the hiking boot with 
116 million in sales 
so far the main entrants in the water shoe market are 
stoughtonbased reebok international ltd nike and omega corp a 
privatelyheld boat shoe manufacturer in boston 
citing the intense competition all three companies declined to 
release sales figures 
after the water shoe whats next 
i dont know said stephen encarnacao head of marketing and 
research for converse inc of north reading its good for people 
to take their sport seriously and to immerse themselves in it but 
you can take this thing too far i wouldnt want us to take 
ourselves so seriously that we really believe you need a croquet

retired adm james b busey iv planted a bright 
orange flag on a federal aviation administration stage tuesday and 
took the oath as administrator of the 50000employee agency 
youve got to plant your own flag now in the navy you used to 
have people do it for you transportation secretary samuel skinner 
told busey before swearing him in on a stage decorated with the 
bright faa banner 
skinner said busey was taking on a harder job than his own the 
former commander of us navy forces in europe succeeds allan 
mcartor who resigned as faa administrator in february 
the faa oversees nonmilitary aviation and includes air traffic 
control operations that monitor and guide aircraft through us 
skies it also is responsible for the safety of all types of 
aircraft 
among challenges busey faces are the need to modernize and expand 
the air traffic control system protect the safety of the nations 
aging airliner fleet and meet what he said is the threat of 
statesponsored terrorism 
skinner who has kept a high profile on aviation issues during 
the four months the agency was without a permanent head said he did 
not know busey before beginning the process of searching for a new 
administrator but he said he was convinced busey is the 
mostqualified man for the job 
congress had to pass special legislation to allow busey to serve 
at the top of the civilian agency while retaining his navy 
retirement status the law creating the faa says its administrator 
must be a civilian although similar legislated exceptions have been 
made in the past 
the admiral received no opposition during confirmation hearings 
busey who rose from an enlisted man to fourstar admiral during 
37 years of navy service has no civilian aviation experience he is 
a pilot however and had been commander of the naval air systems 
command 
busey in brief remarks gave no indication of policies he would 
pursue but said he would work to keep the skies safe and planned to 
travel extensively to faa facilities where the rubber meets the 
road 
the swearingin ceremonies broadcast by satellite to 33 faa 
facilities featured an original song by an faa choral group a 
prayer by a minister and the singing of an expanded version of the 
star spangled banner by a soprano both the minister harold pratt 
and the singer sandra buchanan are also faa employees

the district of columbia council on tuesday 
canceled a vote on legislation aimed at holding handgun 
manufacturers financially liable for injuries and deaths caused in 
shootings 
the bill apparently the first of its kind in the nation had 
faced an unfriendly reception in congress which has the power to 
review and reject any law passed by the council 
councilmember wilhelmina rolark said she was withdrawing the bill 
because court cases in which plaintiffs are suing handgun 
manufacturers have not yet been resolved 
rep stan parris rva a frequent critic of the district 
government had threatened to block the legislation he likened the 
bill to an attempt to hold black and decker responsible for the 
texas chainsaw massacre 
del walter fauntroy ddc told the council in a letter 
delivered on monday that the bill was likely to be rejected by the 
house 
there were simply not the votes to support the bill said 
councilmember charlene drewjarvis it could cause problems on 
the hill 
the councils action shows enlightened foresight parris said 
in a statement released after the bill was pulled back 
richard gardner state and local affairs director of the national 
rifle association had contended the bill was unconstitutional he 
said it would limit interstate commerce a regulatory right reserved 
for the federal government 
the bill given preliminary approval by an 84 vote two weeks 
ago was created in an attempt to stem a drugrelated wave of 
murders and other violent crime 
through tuesday 229 persons had been killed in washington in 
1989 compared with 159 by the same time last year in 1988 a 
record 372 persons were killed

garfield park is surrounded by some of the citys 
meanest streets and sending four unofficial rangers to patrol the 
ganginfested area on expensive bicycles is what some are calling a 
tragedy waiting to happen 
theres less crime in the park than in the neighborhoods around 
it thats the good news said police sgt john rooney a member 
of the violent crimes unit the bad news is that i wouldnt advise 
anybody ranger or not to ride through garfield park on a 700 
bicycle the idea doesnt exactly strike me as a brainstorm 
the rangers in the parks program as conceived by city parks 
officials was to be a network of hundreds of volunteers and 
offduty police officers on horseback and allterrain vehicles 
crisscrossing the citys parks goodwill ambassadors backed by 
police powers and a 90000 budget 
what it became after budget cuts was a 12000 pilot program in 
garfield park 
we first envisioned this with rangers in 12 parks guides for 
tourists in the lakefront parks promoting our programs and 
teaching appreciation for the history and beauty of the parks at 
one point even an eyesandearsofthepolice kind of thing said 
jim albritton the park district supervisor in charge of the program 
the first element cut from the rangers program was any kind of 
lawenforcement role 
though they carry twoway radios and are in touch with park 
district supervisors who in turn can call police the rangers 
will have very limited roles as peacekeepers albritton said 
the idea is build goodwill in the park not break up fights to 
make friends with the kids report equipment that needs fixing 
nudge people to clean up after themselves keep an eye peeled for 
emergencies 
but whether they should call in if they see a drug buy for 
instance thats a very touchy question albritton said were 
still working on those questions 
rooney said park district officials had better come up with the 
answers quickly 
there are a few gangs and lots of dope being sold in some parts 
of the park he said theres potential for trouble if they get 
mixed up in that 
freda collins a former speech pathologist and construction 
worker who is the lone woman on the crew said she believes her job 
is to be visible to encourage people to bring their kids and 
their picnic baskets back to the park 
each ranger receives an 18speed trail bike a uniform and three 
days of training they work eight hours each day from june until 
early september earning 6 an hour 
collins colleagues are fourthgrade teacher isaac battle former 
military policeman donnell daniel and former marketing executive 
randis clark 
were not so much worried about the danger we all live in the 
area and know what goes down she said thats what the police 
are for

the air force hoping to stem congressional 
opposition to the b2 bomber said tuesday that the radarevading 
aircraft outpaces 20 years of improvements in the soviet air defense 
and is key to the united states strategic force 
the estimate is the soviets have invested the equivalent of 
over 350 billion n those defenses over the 20year period and 
that investment continues the air force said in an 18page report 
released by the ranking members of the senate armed services 
committee 
that very expensive array of defenses is largely ineffective 
against an aircraft with b2 capabilities the report said 
in a closed session air force secretary donald rice and air 
force chief of staff larry welch briefed members of the senate armed 
services committee on the b2 detailing the aircrafts importance 
to the strategic forces its conventional capability and its role if 
a start agreement is reached with the soviet union 
sens sam nunn dga chairman of the panel and john warner of 
virginia ranking republican released the report 
we asked the air force to address the key issues of cost 
flight testing and the comparable worth of the b2 as the congress 
debates the defense program nunn and warner said in a onepage 
statement accompanying the report 
opposition in congress is based on the bombers pricetag 
estimated at between 500 million and 750 million a copy and the 
delay in its first flight 
the bomber moved under its own power monday when it taxied along 
a mojave desert runway it is scheduled to make its maiden flight in 
the next few weeks 18 months behind schedule 
i have serious concerns about the aircraft said senate armed 
services member john mccain rariz who attended the air force 
briefing the service must prove this aircraft before fullscale 
production 
another member of the senate panel democrat john glenn of ohio 
last month urged defense secretary dick cheney to push back 
procurement of the aircraft questioning the wisdom of buy before 
you fly 
in another step the house armed services committee slashed about 
500 million from the aircrafts procurement budget in fiscal 1990 
the pentagon has proposed spending a total of about 47 billion for 
the bomber 
one day after the runway test the air force presented its 
argument to the senate armed services panel which is in the midst 
of voting on the fiscal 1990 defense budget 
the b2 can fly through virtually unchallenged by air defense 
weapons and has the resilience to cope with the longer term 
improvements in air defenses the soviets may choose to make the 
service said 
the air force also argued that the bomber can make a powerful 
contribution with its conventional capability specifically the 
b2 can cover all the worlds land areas from three locations 
whiteman air force base in missouri diego garcia in the indian 
ocean and guam in the pacific with a single air refueling 
the air force said the b2 program is both affordable and 
essential consuming a smaller portion of the total military 
budget than either of the last two large bomber programs

defense secretary dick cheney predicting he 
can save taxpayers 30 billion by fiscal year 1993 outlined a 
complex plan tuesday to overhaul the pentagons bureaucracy and 
tighten control over its massive armspurchasing systems 
his proposals include paring the number of people involved in 
purchasing decisions by thousands and giving more authority to the 
undersecretary of defense in that area thereby trimming some powers 
of the individual military services 
cheney was quick to say he had no magic solution for ridding the 
pentagon and the defense establishment of fraud and abuse or making 
it more efficient nor will he be able to make his program work on 
his own he said 
theres no silver bullet here we have a blueprint that we 
plan to pursue to try to significantly improve the way we do 
business cheney said of his plan said at a pentagon press 
conference 
if were going to be successful it will be because we got 
congress to cooperate he said 
his report was requested by president bush five months ago as 
part of a major review spurred by the weaponsprocurement scandals 
that rocked the defense establishment 
weapons purchases account for more than 60 billion of this 
years 305 billion military budget and involve more than a 
halfmillion civilian and uniformed employees of the defense 
department 
cheney acted tuesday to put some of the changes in place in 
particular the realignment of his toplevel pentagon management 
team other steps require congressional approval while others will 
need work throughout my tenure at the department the secretary 
said 
even before its official release the package stirred opposition 
on capitol hill where some said it doesnt go into enough detail 
however one democratic member of the senate armed services 
committee jeff bingaman of new mexico said tuesday that cheneys 
report is a good start toward acquisition reform and i look 
forward to working with him on his legislative proposals 
sen john mccain rariz also a member of the armed services 
panel said the present system is absolutely inefficient 
sometimes worse and cheneys proposal deserves strong support 
cheney also seeks relief from some congressional oversight 
requests complaining that congress requires a staggering amount 
of reports inquiries and testimony from the military 
to emphasize that point cheney and his deputy donald atwood 
stood beside two fivefoot high stacks of reports that congress had 
requested from the pentagon during the past year one of the reports 
cost 19 million to produce the secretary said 
im convinced nobody ever reads these reports cheney 
quipped evoking laughter from his audience its makework 
before taking the top pentagon job this year cheney was a 
republican leader in the house 
cheney also is suggesting that congress implement fully a 
twoyear defense budget process and establish select committees in 
both houses to review and rewrite the maze of federal procurement 
laws 
asked how many jobs would be cut due to the paring down of the 
system neither cheney nor atwood provided a specific answer 
cheney said that while more than 580000 military and civilians 
are involved in the acquisition process much work is being done 
because of the oversight requirements imposed by congress and 
savings will depend a lot upon the kind of support and cooperation 
we get on capitol hill 
queried about possible resistance to the reforms on the part of 
the military officers who may lose some clout over weapons programs 
cheney said that hed taken care to bring the military service heads 
into planning his report and that he believed most people in the 
department will in fact support it 
many of the ideas included in the reform package were first 
proposed in the 1986 blue ribbon commission on defense management 
also known as the packard commission 
the secretarys goal is to eliminate some layers in the 
militarys top management and establish a clear chain of command 
in the arms procurement process said one defense department 
official familiar with cheneys thinking 
the proposals include 
establishing an executive panel to make all the major decisions 
for the department 
the board would be composed of the secretary the deputy 
secretary undersecretary the deputies for procurement and 
acquisitions the heads of the various services and the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff 
the panel would be smaller than the current defense resources 
board which advises cheney on major weapons and budgetary decisions 
allowing the deputy secretary of defense to oversee the 
pentagons system for planning programming and devising its budget 
he would oversee the defense planning and resources board which 
also will be asked to come up with a 20year road map on the 
longterm needs and investment plans for the department 
enhancing the powers of the undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition dubbed the acquisition czar the undersecretary 
would have full authority for major acquisition programs which 
would trim some of the services powers 
paring down and consolidating overlapping structures in the 
acquisition system eliminating layers and functions that have no 
value 
the report notes that some 580000 civilian and military 
personnel around the world are involved in the procurement process 
the report suggests trimming the organizations on a phased basis 
by at least 15 percent by 1993 
establishing a defense contract management agency to consolidate 
contract administration activities and ride herd on the contracts 
after they have been awarded

hundreds of nurses demanding higher pay to 
ease a nursing shortage went on strike at northern californias 
biggest pediatric hospital tuesday forcing the transfer of nearly 
100 critically ill youngsters 
were special people with special skills and we need special 
pay said a 34yearold registered nurse who identified herself 
only as jean 
she joined the line outside childrens hospital when the night 
shift ended and the strike began at 7 am some 200 nurses picketed 
a line of ambulances began moving the young patients some of 
northern california and northern nevadas most critically ill 
children shortly after midnight an operation officials didnt 
expect to end until wednesday 
doctors and management took up some nursing duties said hospital 
spokesman steve tiger 
patients were sent mostly to other san francisco bay area 
hospitals but tiger said many might go to hospitals as far away as 
los angeles and seattle 
the strike came after the california nurses association 
representing 700 nurses at childrens rejected a wage offer of 18 
percent over two years by a 41 margin monday night the nurses 
previous contract expired june 30 
the nurses are demanding a twoyear 26 percent raise 
if we dont do enough to attract people we wont have the best 
and the brightest nurses around for these children said intensive 
care nurse karen cooper 
she called the strike a painful step to avert an even worse 
labor crunch in the 1990s a nursing shortage has hobbled hospital 
throughout the country 
no new talks were scheduled hospital administrator tony paap 
said the hospital will not improve its offer and he predicted a 
long strike 
we feel like the nursing union is disrupting the childrens 
care in the misguided hope of ending a nationwide nursing 
shortage said tiger 
tiger denied there were real staffing shortages at this 
hospital at 6 percent childrens has the lowest vacancy rate 
among nurses in california he said 
approximately 90 of about 140 patients were to be transferred and 
about 10 others were to be discharged leaving only some of the most 
severely ill 
many of the youngsters at the hospital which is one of only 14 
in the nation with a pediatric trauma center are premature have 
lung or heart ailments or are burn patients said nursing supervisor 
dorothy holmes 
the hospital postponed elective surgery and stopped admitting 
patients from the emergency room walkin emergency care will be 
offered and general admissions will be done on a casebycase 
basis tiger said 
childrens nurses now make between 32000 and 39000 which has 
made them among the highest paid in the nation but because of 
recent wage increases at other facilities cna officials fear nurses 
will leave childrens 
the union is seeking salaries that would range between 39400 
and 49100

a justice department official said tuesday that 
a senate proposal to enhance puerto ricos commonwealth status 
would render the island virtually independent of us authority in 
many areas 
the governor of puerto rico would be granted an unprecedented 
and truly extraordinary power to certify that a federal law or a 
federal regulation is inapplicable to puerto rico edward sg 
dennis told a hearing of the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
dennis acting deputy attorney general said the proposal for the 
enhancement of commonwealth also would grant puerto rico much 
greater advantages than any other area under us sovereignty that 
is not a state 
so long as puerto rico remains under the sovereignty of the 
united states it is essential that this fact be made clear 
dennis told the committee 
he advised the committee to make clear that any autonomy 
provided the commonwealth be limited to internal affairs 
congress retains the authority to legislate with respect to 
puerto rico he added federal law may not be preempted or 
nullified by the local government 
dennis told the committee the proposal for statehood is the 
least problematic and said most people understand what statehood 
means but he advised the committee to make sure that any vote for 
independence would be a vote for full independence 
sen j bennett johnston dla chairman of the committee told 
the administration spokesman he believes the commonwealth should 
have as much autonomy as is possible and also urged full 
citizenship be allowed for the first generation should the voters of 
puerto rico choose independence in a plebiscite scheduled for 1991 
johnston said he said he would favor the right of those puerto 
ricans wishing to retain us citizenship to do so but does not 
believe it should extend to their children 
during the morning session in a threeday round of hearings on 
puerto ricos status the chairman needled bush for declaring his 
personal preference for statehood and expressed hopes the 
administration would be evenhanded in its treatment of the 
upcoming plebiscite

the grateful dead trading guitars for 
briefcases came to congress tuesday to draw attention to the 
malaysian rain forests an issue they say is new to most of their 
dead head fans 
jerry garcia bob weir and mickey hart members of the band that 
has attracted devotion from fans for about two decades said they 
hoped to focus public awareness on the drive to stop destruction of 
the rain forests 
while the three said they were eager to promote the cause among 
their fans garcia seemed to enjoy sparring with rep claudine 
schneider rri who suggested the band encourage dead heads 
i would guess that about 90 percent of the dead heads dont 
vote schneider said at the hearing sponsored by the congressional 
human rights caucus 
thats about right responded garcia who said many people 
need a specific positive reason to vote 
when schneider told garcia she entered politics because she 
wanted to change the world the guitarist said she need not 
worry were on the team he said 
then garcia asked the congressional panel where are the rest 
of the people on the human rights caucus 
only six members of the 185member caucus attended the hearing 
garcia wearing his gray hair in a ponytail and smoking 
cigarettes in a nosmoking room said hed never been to malaysia 
but was captivated by the rain forest issue because im an 
earthling on this planet 
deforestation has become a top priority of environmentalists 
around the world who say that denuding the land destroys species of 
plants and animals creates water pollution encourages the 
spreading of the desert and leads frequently to flooding and 
mudslides 
rep benjamin gilman rny cochairman of the caucus 
discussed how the tropical forests in malaysia specifically in the 
sarawak region of borneo are being destroyed at a rapid rate at 
the same time the inhabitants of the rain forests are being 
resettled and some have been jailed for attempting a blockade to 
stop logging on their ancestral lands 
gilman has introduced legislation to protect such peoples 
throughout the world 
other legislation pending in congress authorizes suspension of 
dutyfree treatment to wood products unless the affected countries 
implement reforestation programs 
weir a guitarist with the grateful dead said that some 
estimates are that tropical rain forests around the world might be 
destroyed in 50 years unless efforts are made to stop logging 
in malaysia much of the logging is done by japanese cartels that 
use the wood for disposable chopsticks 
several representatives of the malaysian embassy attended the 
hearing but were not impressed with the testimony or a film that 
showed the plight of the people on sarawak 
an embassy official called the film sensationalist and said many 
people were not informed about the malaysian reforestation efforts 
as for the grateful dead the counselor said i dont know of 
this band

hud secretary jack kemp said tuesday that 
housing scandals at his department could cost the government 2 
billion but also said we have stopped the hemorrhaging 
its a ballpark figure said kemp who has suspended three 
programs as part of his investigation into allegations of 
mismanagement and fraud at the department of housing and urban 
development during the reagan administration 
responding to questioning by a congressional panel he said of 
estimates of potential losses i think 6 billion would be too 
high 1 billion would be too low 
rep charles schumer dny came up with the 2 billion figure 
and asked kemp his opinion of it 
while saying his department has not come up with its own 
estimate kemp said he did not disagree with schumers figure he 
also said he believed recent efforts to cut the governments losses 
have been successful 
earlier kemp denounced a system under which highly paid 
consultants helped developers try to win federal housing contracts 
but he said he would not wage war on effective programs in his 
department 
i do not want to wage war on programs i am not trying to 
wage war on the goals that have been set for these programs to help 
needy people and low income people said the secretary 
he also told a congressional panel he was taking steps to correct 
fundamental flaws and lax accounting and management 
procedures at his department 
kemp who took over the department of housing and urban 
development six months ago said he had told agency employees in a 
memo that their jobs would depend on putting an end to favoritism 
and he said outsiders discovered to be abusing department 
programs will be barred from doing business with hud and all other 
federal agencies 
kemps comments came in remarks to the house employment and 
housing subcommittee which is looking into allegations of fraud and 
mismanagement at the agency 
some of our most serious problems have come in programs where 
substantial subsidies are given to developers kemp said 
that extra money goes for excess profits for the developer and 
clearly to cover consultant fees he said we give the 
developer a reason to hire a consultant and we give the successful 
bidder the money to pay consultants fees 
the departments moderaterehabilitation program was criticized 
in an april audit by the hud inspector general who alleged influence 
peddling and favoritism in contract awards to developers who hired 
former hud and other government employees as consultants 
the audit estimated hud could lose as much as 413 million in 
excess subsidies over the life of the contracts 
several reagan administration insiders including former interior 
secretary james watt have been questioned at house hearings into 
what they did for their consulting fees and what the feepayers 
expected in return 
kemp said tuesday hud programs shall operate without 
favoritism and awards will be made on the basis of need and merit 
the housing secretary said that in a memo to hud employees last 
month he warned performance evaluations and job security will 
depend on how these reforms are promptly implemented and enforced 
the department of housing and urban development will maintain a 
policy of zero tolerance for violations of our standards of 
conduct said kemp pledging the highest ethical standards at 
the department 
kemp has testified several times before congress in recent 
months a sharp contrast to his predecessor samuel pierce who 
members of congress say was generally unavailable during his 
eightyear tenure during the reagan administration 
since taking office kemp has suspended revised or restricted 
three troubled programs moderate rehabilitation mortgage 
coinsurance and title x land development mortgage insurance which 
provide subsidized housing to low and moderateincome families 
last week he curtailed an elderlyhousing program in which 30 
percent of the projects had resulted in foreclosure 
however he has promised he will not use huds problems to 
curtail the federal governments role in housing 
the subcommittee later this week is scheduled to hear from two 
former hud officials involved in a project that was pushed by a 
former law partner of thenhud secretary pierce 
one of the former officials shirley mcvay wiseman has said that 
she quit hud because pierce ordered her to finance the north 
carolina project despite objections by career agency officials the 
second janet hale was named by pierce to replace ms wiseman and 
then approved the funding ms hale is now a budget analyst at the 
office of management and budget but is steering clear of most 
hudrelated matters while the subject is being investigated 
the subcommittee also is to recall pierce who said in an earlier 
appearance that he had no direct role in funding decisions 
newsday reported tuesday that pierce while hud secretary was 
one of 2862 partners in an investment partnership that bought a 
kansas city apartment building through a hudinsured construction 
loan pierce listed the 20000 investment in mlh properties ltd 
partnership ii on his financial disclosure forms but said the 
venture had no hud involvement newsday reported 
pierce said he never personally checked whether the partnership 
had any hudrelated dealings look thats peanuts pierce was 
quoted as telling the newspaper theres no money its not enough 
to worry about

a judge ordered a man who fathered six 
illegitimate children to refrain from having more kids with anyone 
except his wife 
derone suber in court to plead guilty to stealing a city 
sanitation truck got a lecture from judge frank eppes on the need 
to own up to responsibility 
suber 26 has six children from several women he fathered his 
first child when he was 13 
the states got to pay for him and his children said eppes 
this is one of the most tragic things ive seen in court in a long 
time 
at first eppes wanted to make suber visit schools or churches 
but suber who uses a walker because of injuries suffered when he 
crashed the struck in 1986 would have difficulty meeting that 
sentence said his lawyer w barry bland 
eppes then placed suber on five years probation with the 
condition that suber not have children with anyone but his wife 
civil libertarians questioned the appropriateness of the sentence 
but a criminal law scholar said it probably did not violate subers 
rights 
bill mcaninch a professor at the university of south carolina 
law school said cited state laws prohibiting fornication and 
adultery and said that defendants on probation are required to obey 
all state laws 
i guess what hes doing is just singling out one part of the 
law said mcaninch who specializes in criminal and constitutional 
law 
the matter probably would not become an issue unless suber 
violated the terms of his sentence and eppes decided to enforce it 
said steven bates executive director of the american civil 
liberties union of south carolina 
bland said he may appeal the sentence 
in april the 66yearold judge came under fire for springing 
soul music legend james brown from prison for a day to sign 
autographs

minnesota asked permission from congress 
tuesday for an experimental program to encourage poor people to go 
to work by allowing them to retain some of their welfare benefits 
the minnesota plan would reward work working would always be 
more profitable than not working said john petraborg assistant 
commissioner for the minnesota department of human services 
minnesota officials asked a house agriculture subcommittee 
tuesday to approve a waiver from federal regulations necessary to 
try the program with fewer than 6000 welfare recipients in rural 
and urban areas of the state starting in 1992 
the panel which oversees the food stamp program is one of six 
in the house and senate that must agree to the change because of the 
variety of welfare plans it covers 
in addition to encouraging poor people to find jobs the program 
also would simplfy government assistance programs petraborg said 
the waiver would allow the state to combine benefits from federal 
welfare programs including aid to families with dependent children 
and food stamps into a single cash payment that families could use 
as they chose 
a poor woman with one child could make as much as 615 an hour 
and still retain some of her monthly payment under the minnesota 
plan he said 
under federal regulations the woman is discouraged from looking 
for a job because she would lose her benefits if she made as little 
as 315 an hour he said 
seven percent of the families receiving afdc payments in 
minnesota those who remain on the rolls for seven years or more 
account for 40 percent of the cost of the program in that state he 
said 
the minnesota plan is bound to cost more money but the state 
legislature has agreed to absorb the extra cost petraborg said the 
additional cost of the program has not been determined he said 
rep charles hatcher dga the subcommittee chairman called 
the program a challenging concept with potential for real 
rewards for recipients and society 
rep bill emerson rmo said he liked the idea of onestop 
shopping for welfare recipients provided by combining the benefits 
into a cash payment 
i believe that our public assistance programs are so complex 
and confusing that it is no wonder that participants and 
administrators alike have difficulty with them he said 
a representative of the food research and action center an 
organization that tried to strengthen federal food programs for the 
poor raised concerns that the minnesota program could force mothers 
to go to work instead of staying home with small children 
robert fersh executive director of the organization also said 
that eliminating food coupons in lieu of cash payments could 
encourage landlords to raise rents to get the extra money

because of lateness dropping a ball or missing a tackle is illegal

its another attempt by the government to mandate everything

moslem guerrillas bombarded the capital 
with rockets tuesday killing four people shortly after the 
sovietbacked government announced a unilateral ceasefire to mark a 
moslem holiday 
after the attack afghan foreign ministry spokesman mohammad 
nabi amani warned of growing public anger against pakistan for its 
support of the guerrillas and warned that afghanistan would strike 
back 
meanwhile hundreds of afghans marched through kabul urging the 
government to take military action against pakistan where most of 
the insurgents are based 
the moslem guerrillas supported by the united states have 
fought an 11year war against the sovietbacked government 
on tuesday at least six rockets slammed into kabul after a week 
of intensified guerrilla attacks on the capital 
on monday at least 55 rockets hit the city of 225 million 
people killing 18 civilians and two soldiers and wounding 51 
people the government said hospital sources said that at least 165 
people including 22 children were hurt in the bombing which also 
destroyed a weapons depot near the airport 
but in a statement issued by the governmentinexile in 
islamabad the guerrillas denied firing rockets at civilian targets 
mujahedeen commanders around kabul and other cities have strict 
instructions to aim only at the enemys military installations and 
to be careful not to miss their targets the statement said 
the guerrillacontrolled afghan news agency charged that 
government troops fire rockets at civilian targets to discredit the 
mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the rocket attacks came despite the ceasefire announced by 
president najib to celebrate the threeday eid alazha or feast of 
sacrifice which begins thursday 
najibs spokesman sarwar yourish told reporters that government 
troops would lay down their weapons from midnight tuesday until 
midnight saturday to observe the festival eid aladha is the 
threeday holiday marking the end of the annual moslem hajj or 
pilgrimage to the holy cities of mecca and medina 
hundreds of people marched in at least three rallies staged by 
the governing peoples democratic party of afghanistan calling for 
military action against pakistan 
najibs government has frequently accused pakistan of direct 
involvement in rocket attacks on kabul a charge that the government 
in islamabad denies 
there is a growing resentment and anger among the afghan people 
against pakistan which is directly involved in the war against us 
amanis said the people of afghanistan want the government to take 
serious measures against pakistan 
he did not specify what measures might be taken but diplomatic 
sources said the government was seeking the backing of public 
opinion for a possible strike on rebel bases inside pakistan 
afghanistan and the soviet union have alleged that the 
guerrillas along with pakistani military advisers are planning an 
offensive on kabul up until last week guerrrilla efforts were 
concentrated on the city of jalalabad 
the soviet union withdrew the last of its 115000 troops on feb 
15 under a unmediated accord ending nine years of military 
involvement in afghanistan moscow however has continued to supply 
arms to the kabul government 
in moscow the official soviet news agency tass said that 
decisive retaliatory measures will be taken by afghanistan in 
response to pakistani support for the guerrillas 
in this case responsibility for the consequences will rest on 
the pakistan military tass said

president bush sat down for lunch with 
solidarity leader lech walesa at his home tuesday to a menu of 
turkey roast beef pork and plenty of politics 
commenting on the huge banquet bush said my mother taught me 
to eat whats before you in this house i would weigh 300 pounds 
accompanied by his wife barbara bush went to walesas home in 
this seaport city in a gesture of respect for the trade union leader 
who helped spark a political revolution in poland 
walesa the father of eight children told bush im trying to 
keep my kids out of politics 
bush replied its hard to do how about your wife can you 
keep her out of politics 
its different with wives walesa replied sitting alongside 
his wife danuta in their small dining room walesa who is toying 
with the idea of running for the new but powerful post of president 
of poland did not elaborate about wives 
later walesa said that my primary appeal and request to bush 
was for a 10 billion package of assistance for poland bush called 
the proposal interesting and emphasized that walesa was not asking 
for outright cash but for investment assistance 
walesas twostory brick and stucco home at 54 polanki street is 
not a typical polish residence which frequently is nothing more 
than a cramped apartment 
walesas home is located on a big plot of land surrounded by a 
chainlink fence topped with barbed wire and boasts a small pond 
an orchard of pear and apple trees and a carefully tended flower 
garden 
the twocar garage behind the house is topped by a large 
satellite dish for receiving television programs 
a huge pile of sand and lumber in the rear gave a hint of 
walesas plans for home improvements 
the house is fairly old and it needs to be remodeled almost as 
much as poland does walesa said i really am trying to get to 
work on fixing it up and i hope ill be just as successful with 
poland 
bush replied you must have very cold winters up here right 
walesa acknowledged that he lives a privileged lify 
if i were an ordinary pole walesa said i wouldnt be able 
to afford it 
explaining his ability to afford such a comfortable home walesa 
said i used to live in an ordinary apartment but its because i 
make some money out of solidarity 
he did not explain but previously has said that he purchased the 
home a year ago with earnings from his autobiography a way of 
hope 
the walesas dining room was adorned with a woven wall hanging of 
the polish black madonna and child a common religious symbol in 
this country walesa offered bush beer but he declined the two men 
and their wives each lifted a glass of vodka to salute each other at 
the remarkable occasion 
the menu prepared by family friends was this smoked eel and 
salmon with lemon slices a traditional cold vegetable soup called 
choldnik roast beef turkey schnitzel and pork loin with mushrooms 
garnished with pineapple grapes peaches orange slices radishes 
and new potatotes 
desert was mixed jello with nut topping

we need legislation to protect public health when a temporary 
drop in the price of lead discourages recycling and car batteries 
are buried or burned thus threatening the water we drink and the 
air we breathe said hochbrueckner 
when lead prices are high lead fabricators willingly buy the 
batteries from recycling firms for the 20 pounds of lead in each 
about 90 percent of all used batteries were recycled in 1980 
according to rep george hochbrueckner dny but when prices 
decline so does recycling to 66 percent in 1985 the most recent 
year for which figures are available 
us bureau of mines figures show us lead prices at almost 53 
cents per pound in 1979 43 cents in 1980 and 19 cents in 1985 
since then prices recovered to 37 cents last year peaking at 42 
cents in december before falling back to 35 cents for 1989 so far 
hochbrueckners bill would require consumers to return used car 
batteries to retailers who would be legally bound to take them the 
retailers would then have to turn the batteries over to the 
manufacturers or to recyclers 
failure to comply would be a misdemeanor with violators facing a 
maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a 5000 fine 
a car or truck goes through several batteries in its lifetime 
often getting a new one every two or three years so the number of 
batteries discarded every year is much greater than the number of 
vehicles being junked about 70 million batteries per year 
currently 
the legislation would also require a report by the environmental 
protection agency on discarded household drycell batteries which 
can contain toxic mercury cadmium lead nickel and manganese and 
the prospects for recycling them 
under epa regulations any business that discards eight or more 
vehicle batteries per month must send them to a federally licensed 
landfill or other disposal facility if they do not recycle them 
said epa spokeswoman robin woods 
violators face civil penalties of a 25000 fine per day per 
violation and criminal sanctions of up to 50000 per day per 
violation plus a jail term of up to five years she said 
hochbrueckner said state deposit laws encouraging the recycling 
of batteries are in effect in california florida minnesota 
pennsylvania rhode island wyoming and suffolk county ny his 
bill would permit such laws to remain in effect

president bush doffed his raincoat 
during a downpour tuesday and presented it to an elderly woman who 
wildly applauded his speech in kossuth square 
the impromptu move startled secret service agents but bush 
seemed pleased with what he had done 
asked hours later after a dinner in the parliament with communist 
party chairman rezso nyers what he would use in its place bush 
said its not going to rain anymore its not going to rain on my 
parade 
the elderly woman had waited for about an hour to hear bushs 
speech she stood behind a rope without shelter from the rain but 
seemed not to mind most of the people around her were older and 
shielded from the downpour so evidently she caught the presidents 
eye 
the tumult that followed the presidents gesture prevented 
reporters from getting close

a visa after he was invited to the united states to speak according 
to the lawsuit filed in us district court 
kanharith a journalist is a member of the national assembly in 
cambodia 
the communist government was installed during the 1978 vietnamese 
occupation of cambodia and is engaged in negotiations with a 
political faction led by ussupported prince norodon sihanouk 
the state department said kanharith was ineligible for a visa 
because there is reason to believe he would engage in activities 
prejudicial to the public interest or would endanger us security 
us rep chester atkins dmass and the american society of 
newspaper editors filed the suit against secretary of state james 
baker iii and attorney general dick thornburgh 
the refusal to grant a visa based on political associations or 
anticipated political speech violates federal law and violates the 
first amendment rights of the plaintiffs to exchange ideas on 
matters of vital national interest said the suit 
the foreign relations authorization act says no alien may be 
denied a visa because of beliefs that if engaged in by a us 
citizen would be protected by the constitution 
the suit seeks a court order that kanharith be issued a visa 
atkins wants kanhariths views on the current political situation 
in cambodia and us policy options there asne wants kanharith to 
meet with its members to discuss events in cambodia 
the american civil liberties union is representing the 
plaintiffs who include the american friends service committee and

laurence kerr olivier baron of brighton was 
considered the foremost actor of his generation his toughest role 
was always larry olivier 
with ferocious will he fought cancer pleurisy and a muscle 
disease that made even handshakes agony he endured two miserable 
marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright contemplated murder 
and suicide and battled his own rages guilts and drinking 
yet in more than six decades on stage and screen he was in the 
words of the times of london actings supreme technician and 
master craftsman 
in recognition of his illustrious career he was knighted and 
later elevated to peerage with the title baron 
he gave the world its definitive hamlet henry v and richard iii 
as well as at age 76 a matchless king lear for television he set 
a new standard for film hero in wuthering heights and was the 
embodiment of ungraceful age in the entertainer on stage and a 
voyage round my father and brideshead revisited on television 
two years ago on his 80th birthday tributes flowed during a 
ceremony at the national theater which he founded in 1963 
awe and wonder you gave us awe and wonder actress dame 
peggy ashcroft told him at the time director peter hall called him 
the genius performer 
for olivier life and acting were inseparable i have to act to 
breathe he said 
by turns he loved and hated his craft but never would 
contemplate retiring from it acting simply consumed him 
playing othello he spent months training his voice to a low 
growl and bending his frame to a lope each night he spent two 
hours applying shining black body makeup 
two things drove him he said in his 1982 autobiography 
confessions of an actor lust and guilt 
whatever sex drive he had olivier wrote went into his acting 
you cant be more than one kind of athlete at a time a sexual 
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another 
athletic kind 
the guilt came from his religious upbringing he said 
born may 22 1907 in the town of dorking southwest of london 
laurence kerr olivier was the third child of an anglican clergyman 
who encouraged him early on to try acting 
it was olivier said the family business those preachers knew 
when to drop the voice when to bellow about the perils of hellfire 
when to slip in a gag he recalled 
his first stage was at home with footlights made of cocoa cans 
at 10 he was brutus in a school performance at 15 he donned 
womens clothes to play katherine in a stratford festival boys 
production of the taming of the shrew 
at 17 he went to birmingham to study acting peggy ashcroft who 
knew him there remembered him as a bit uncouth his hair stood on 
end his sleeves were short and he was extremely physical 
oliviers first professional role was in 1922 in a sketch in a 
small touring company in his first london role in alice laws 1924 
byron he tripped over a doorsill and fell on his face 
the early years were tough but fruitful he spent three years in 
birmingham repertory returned to london in 1928 played in beau 
geste and journeys end and went to new york to appear in a 
murder mystery 
in 1930 at age 23 he married actress jill esmond even though 
she told him she didnt love him 
the marriage was a debacle but they had a son and kept the 
marriage going for 10 years out of a pathetic mixture of religious 
and animal promptings olivier said 
but if his private life was a shambles his career was soaring 
he piled success noel cowards private lives in london and 
new york upon success shakespeares romeo and juliet in 
which he and john gielgud a friend from his birmingham days 
alternated playing romeo and mercutio 
said gielgud i had the voice larry had the legs 
in 1937 as war clouds gathered in europe olivier joined gielgud 
at the old vic company and along with ralph richardson formed a 
partnership that remade english theater 
olivier played a dazzling succession of shakespearean heroes 
hamlet henry v macbeth triumphing in each olivier gielgud and 
richardson all were knighted after the war 
the step that sealed oliviers stardom was his move to hollywood 
in 1939 to make wuthering heights it was a towering success 
but also olivier recalled an invaluable lesson in acting 
he strutted around the set indulging in appalling overacting 
until director william wyler shouted what do you think you are 
doing you think you are in the opera house 
i suppose this anemic little medium cant take great acting 
olivier replied huffily the set was engulfed in laughter 
i was a stupid conceited pompous little bastard if it had 
not been for the cinema i suppose i would have gone on hamming away 
all my life

in that same year olivier appeared with vivien leigh in a new 
york production of romeo and juliet after nearly two years of 
clandestine love he obtained a divorce and the two were wed 
that marriage too was disastrous though in the early years 
they were a glamorous couple in public vivien soon fell out of 
love had a muchpublicized affair with actor peter finch and a 
series of others and eventually told olivier according to his 
memoirs that she loved him only like a brother 
the marriage continued for another decade with occasional acts 
of incest as she descended into manic depression her mental 
illness tortured olivier he had crippling bouts of stage fright he 
contemplated suicide once he threw her against a wall cut her 
head open and by his own account nearly killed her 
but he blamed himself 
somehow the cause of viviens disturbances were due to some 
fault in me 
they finally were divorced in 1961 and olivier wed actress joan 
plowright with whom he finally found happiness they had a son 
richard and two daughters tamsin and juliekate all three are 
either studying or working in the theater 
miss leigh died of tuberculosis in 1967 
olivier was appointed codirector of the old vic in 1944 after a 
spell in the wartime naval reserve 
in 1947 olivier was knighted but he attained special status 
among actor knights in 1970 when queen elizabeth ii elevated him to 
the peerage with the title baron olivier of brighton the title gave 
him a seat in the house of the lords the upper chamber of 
parliament 
in 1981 olivier was awarded the order of merit which is limited 
to 24 living members he was the only actor to hold it 
while with the old vic olivier also turned his hand to the three 
films that were to make his reputation as the finest shakespearean 
actor in film henry v hamlet for which he won a 
bestactor oscar in 1949 and richard iii in 1979 he received a 
special academy award for his film work 
but olivier was proudest of his work founding britains national 
theater only a man of his titanic standing and relentless energy 
could have brought the project to fruition wrote alan hamilton in 
the times 
olivier was its director from 1963 to 1972 one of the reasons he 
was made a peer baron olivier of brighton in 1970 sir peter 
hall succeeded him in 1973 
over the years he had scores of memorable roles from the fading 
comic archie rice in john osbornes the entertainer to astrov in 
chekhovs uncle vanya to the nazi who tortures dustin hoffman in 
the film marathon man 
to appear truly disheveled in that films famous dentistchair 
scene hoffman kept himself awake for two days straight dear 
boy olivier said to him why dont you try acting its so much 
easier 
in his declining years as he fought off cancer i said to 
myself i will beat you you bastard pleurisy pneumonia 
appendicitis muscular and kidney disorders he kept at his craft in 
smaller roles including most recently a oneday cameo in derek 
jarmans movie war requiem 
he defended his right to accept roles in more dubious projects 
films like the betsy and inchon or dave clarks stage 
musical time in which his image was projected on to a plaster 
model of his head 
vital to me these cameos spiritually and financially he 
wrote in his book on acting ive always managed to give them 
all the animation they need 
his later television work was more rewarding particularly his 
performances as sir arthur opposite katharine hepburn in love 
among the ruins and as the fallen and foolish monarch lear in 
shakespeares great tragedy 
the greatest actor in the greatest play nancy bankssmith 
said of oliviers lear in the guardian newspaper 
i am lear he told his director michael elliott 
in a sense olivier was all his roles 
in his biography he said people often asked his wife joan how 
she knew when he was acting and when he was being himself 
larry he quotes her as saying oh hes acting all the 
time

a reputed associate of florida underworld 
figures told senators at a closeddoor hearing tuesday how he helped 
federal investigators stalk federal judge alcee l hastings in a 
bribery conspiracy case 
we think his testimony went well in terms of presentation of 
how the investigation got under way rep john bryant dtexas 
told reporters after william dredge finished testifying at hastings 
impeachment trial 
hastings a us district judge from miami is accused of 
plotting to get a 150000 payoff of lying about it to a jury that 
acquitted him in 1983 and of improperly disclosing information 
obtained through a federal wiretap 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida history was 
impeached by the house a year ago and is now on trial in the senate 
which could remove him from the bench and take away his 89500 
annual salary 
a committee of senators is hearing the impeachment charges voted 
by the house eventually the full senate will have to vote on the 
charges 
hastings lost a bid tuesday in the us supreme court to halt the 
impeachment trial 
justice byron r white without comment denied hastings request 
to block the proceedings on grounds that the constitution will 
suffer irreparable harm if the impeachment trial is allowed to 
proceed 
hastings had sought a temporary order pending a decision from the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia on his 
efforts to block the senate proceedings 
senators cleared the hearing room and put in effect a television 
blackout as dredge was brought in through a rear entrance lawmakers 
said he apparently is in fear of mob retaliation because of his 
testimony for the government in a racketeering trial involving the 
late florida mob boss santo trafficante 
bryant said that dredge was not part of the governments witness 
protection prorgram but that he is an elusive figure who can only 
be located through the fbi 
on cross examination i think i showed up the slippery little 
worm hastings attorney terence anderson told reporters after 
dredge had been escorted out a rear exit and the hearing reopened to 
the public 
anderson that both he and a number of senators hearing the 
evidence struck at dredges credibility by dwelling on his criminal 
associations 
everyone involved in this knew that dredge had a lengthy 
criminal record spanning his entire adult life bryant told 
reporters he said efforts to remove hastings from the bench do not 
hinge on the credibility of dredges testimony and that all of the 
key points are corroborated by other witnesses 
the purpose of the testimony was to show the senators that there 
was nothing out of the ordinary about the genesis of the hastings 
investigation 
prosecutors say dredge was used as a gobetween by washington 
attorney william borders to solicit a 150000 payoff in exchange 
for hastings keeping two brothers frank and thomas romano out of 
prison they had been sentenced by hastings to three years each 
following a racketeering conviction involving a loan from a 
teamsters union pension fund 
the romano brothers expressed no interest in the alleged scheme 
dredge at the time under indictment on charges of conspiracy to 
distribute quaalude tablets became an informant against borders 
who eventually went to prison 
attorneys and lawmakers said that in his five hours of senate 
testimony dredge essentially retold the story in detail 
hastings emerged from the hearing room for the noon recess and 
told reporters that dredge was an incredible liar 
quite frankly i dont like him hastings said never did 
never will 
he said dredges testimony has been carefully rehearsed and 
gone over repeatedly 
in other action house members acting as prosecutors failed in 
efforts to ask miami criminal lawyer neal sonnett about a telephone 
call between the romano brothers and an associate phillip moscato 
prosecutors say he met with dredge in a garage to discuss the legal 
problems of the romanos 
sonnett told reporters frank romano said that moscato met with 
dredge and reported back that a washington big shot could 
intervene in the case but the romanos said they had no interest in 
such a deal sonnett said 
he said he informed the government of the conversation when the 
chief of the justice departments strike force telephoned him hours 
after borders arrest to warn him that reporters might be calling 
him to task about the case 
the senate panels chairman sen jeff bingaman dnm ruled 
out sonnetts testimony concerning the telephone conversation after 
anderson objected that it was hearsay evidence passed through 
individuals who are either dead or too disabled to testify and 
every one of whom except mr sonnett is a member of one organized 
crime family or another 
justice byron r white without comment denied hastings request 
to block the proceedings on grounds that the constitution will 
suffer irreparable harm if the impeachment trial is allowed to 
proceed 
hastings had sought a temporary order pending a decision from the 
us court of appeals here on his efforts to block the senate 
proceedings

a biologist charged with plagiarism said 
through an attorney tuesday that he will fight his exclusion from 
government research grants and will defend himself before a 
university committee investigating the charges 
c david bridges a former eye researcher at the baylor college 
of medicine in houston and now on the faculty of purdue university 
is charged in an investigation by the national institutes of health 
with using research data from a team of harvard scientists to 
prepare a research report that he published under his own name 
a report on the nih investigation obtained tuesday by the 
associated press through a freedom of information request charges 
that bridges made unauthortized and uncredited use of information 
from a harvard university manuscript that had been sent to him for 
peer review 
the report recommends that bridges be blocked from receiving 
federal grants and excluded from peer review programs for 10 years 
bridges attorney george bishop of houston denied the charges 
and said the researcher will appeal the nih action to the the 
department of health and human services bridges also plans to fight 
an investigation now underway at purdue 
the nih report said bridges used harvard experiment data which 
he saw in the manuscript to conduct his own experiments and then 
published an article in the journal science without acknowledging 
the harvard source the nih said 
plagiarism the unauthorized use of another persons 
experimental protocol in this case is a serious misconduct of 
science in that it undermines the entire peerreview process upon 
which the scientific enterprise is dependent the nih 
investigation report said 
an nih committee that reviewed the investigation said it was 
clearly dismayed by bridges behavior and said that using 
information obtained from unpublished manuscripts sent for peer 
review is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated by scientists or 
the public 
in addition to barring bridges from federal grants and from peer 
review programs the nih report also recommended that all current 
nih grants to bridges be terminated and that the journal science be 
notified of the investigation report 
in what it called a notification to readers the journal 
science will announce the result of the nih investigation in an 
issue to be released friday 
carol rogers a spokeswoman for the american association for 
advancement of science publisher of science said the association 
also will notify science libraries so that the notificiation will be 
crossreferenced in computer files of scientific research 
bishop the houston attorney representing bridges said the nih 
ruling was unfair because bridges was never given a chance to 
confront his accusers or to know precisely the charges 
the charges were reviewed in secret said bishop we think 
if the facts are heard bridges will be vindicated 
bishop said the nih action keeps bridges from making a living and 
could threaten his position at purdue 
those grants are important to keep his livelihood going said 
bishop and loss of the grants probably will have some effect on 
bridges tenured position at purdue 
these colleges and universities particularly in biological 
sciences depend a great deal on grants to keep going said bishop 
the lawyer said that an nih grant given to bridges already has 
been cancelled and that two research assistants have been laid off 
a woman who would identify herself only as an administrative 
assistant at bridges purdue office in west layfayette ind said 
the researcher was not accepting telephone calls and was referring 
all calls to bishop 
joe bennett a spokesman for purdue said that a committee of 
faculty members has been named to investigate the charges against 
bridges he said the committee may review the entire case before 
taking any action 
the matter is not really a purdue issue said bennett since 
the alleged plagarism took place before bridges joined the purdue 
faculty in may 1987 but bennett said purdue could take action if 
it appears the university would be affected 
according to the nih report bridges a professor in the 
department of ophthalmology at baylor college in medicine at the 
time researching the biochemistry of vision was sent a harvard 
university manuscript to review for a national academy of sciences 
publication in the summer of 1986 
science research manuscripts are usually reviewed by experts 
before they are published in learned journals the nih investigation 
said bridges declined to review the manuscript and returned it to 
the academy in september 1986 
the harvard research described in the manuscript had to do with a 
identifying an enzyme called isomerase which plays a role in vision 
in november 1986 bridges submitted a manuscript on isomerase to 
the british journal nature but the article was turned down in 
january 1987 bridges revised the article and then submitted it to 
science which published it in june 1987 
prior to the publication harvard researcher robert r rando 
learned of bridges reports and discovered that bridges had received 
an advance copy of the harvard study rando also noticed the 
similarities of the two studies 
another researcher arranged a meeting between bridges and rando 
and bridges agreed to credit the harvard research in his science 
article this was not done however 
bridges resigned from baylor in august 1987 and went to purdue 
in october the month before he left a baylor committee prompted 
by rando began investigating the science article the committee 
concluded that bridges did misuse the harvard information 
since a federal grant was involved baylor notified the nih which

prime minister yitzhak shamir may call a new 
cabinet vote on his proposal for palestinian elections in a bid to 
save his coalition government from collapse his spokesman said 
tuesday 
spokesman yossi ahimeir confirmed newspaper reports shamir is 
considering a vote to head off moves by the centerleft labor party 
to quit shamirs coalition cabinet and force national elections 
you could say that the prime ministers office should be 
interested in holding such a vote said ahimeir 
a vote could be called within the next three weeks before 
labors central committee meets to make a final decision on mondays 
recommendation by its 120member leadership bureau that the party 
quit the government labor is the junior partner in the coalition 
dominated by shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
renewed cabinet backing for shamirs peace initiative would aim 
at assuaging labor and washington which both object to hardline 
conditions the likud bloc has set for the proposal israeli dailies 
reported 
the peace plan has split shamirs bloc with likud hawks forcing 
the condition that the government first crush the 19month uprising 
against israeli occupation of the occupied gaza strip and west bank 
in the gaza strip on tuesday two men masked with arab kaffiyeh 
scarves shot and killed 28yearold palestinian faqar mohammad 
hassan on a downtown gaza city street 
the army said it believes the slaying was carried out by fellow 
palestinians hassans death comes as attacks are increasing on 
fellow arabs accused of collaborating with israel 
also in gaza three palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes 
with israeli troops arab reports said the army said it was 
investigating 
on the west bank leaders of the revolt called a general strike 
in ramallah and elbireh to protest mondays shootings of three arab 
youths by israeli soldiers and security agents arab reports said 
the army confirmed two of the deaths and said it is investigating 
the third 
killing our people will not stop the intefadeh slogans 
painted on walls in the towns north of jerusalem declared using the 
arabic term for the rebellion 
the deaths around ramallah would bring to 558 the number of 
palestinians killed in the uprising thirtythree israelis also have 
been killed 
in the west bank town of nablus the fundamentalist islamic jihad 
movement praised a palestinians attack last week on an israeli bus 
and urged the use of bullets and grenades in their fight against 
israel 
we praise the mujahed holy warrior who destroyed the zionist 
bus said a jihad leaflet the first issued in the occupied 
territories by the organization fourteen civilians died including 
two canadians when the palestinian refugee wrenched the wheel and 
forced the bus down a ravine 
if shamir calls a vote he would urge cabinet ministers to reject 
amendments to the election plan such as those he accepted as likud 
policy to quell a revolt in his rightwing bloc the daily haaretz 
reported 
the cabinet which first approved the plan by a vote of 206 in 
may probably would defeat the amendments israeli papers said 
shamirs original proposal calls for palestinians in the occupied 
territories to elect representatives to negotiate with israel for 
autonomy the final status of the territories would be decided later 
the proposal is vaguely worded to try to win palestinian approval 
but likud hardliners led by industry minister ariel sharon 
voted for tough conditions including demanding more jewish 
settlements in the occupied lands and that israel refuse to give up 
land seized in the 1967 middle east war 
us middle east policy calls for israel trading land for peace 
and an end to jewish settlements 
shamir insists the likud conditions do not affect the formal 
government peace proposal 
on monday secretary of state james a baker iii said he is 
sending envoys to jerusalem to determine if israel is serious about 
its peace initiative which us diplomats are trying to sell to the 
palestine liberation organization

a state department spokesman on tuesday called 
last weeks attack on an israeli bus a terrorist act 
weve seen reports that the islamic jihad of palestine has 
publicly claimed responsibility richard boucher told reporters 
there are also other reports concerning the motivation of the 
individual it just seems clear that it was a terrorist attack based 
on the information we have now 
the israeli government had complained that the us government 
did not come out strongly on the incident it occurred friday when 
an arab seized the wheel of a bus between tel aviv and jerusalem and 
forced it to plunge into a ravine there were 14 killed including 
two canadians 
boucher said he did not know who was responsible pointing out 
that the palestine liberation organization plo had called it a 
tragedy he added that he did not have a single definition of a 
terrorist act that would cover all possible events 
boucher commented as the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
released a letter to secretary of state james baker complaining that 
the department had not condemned the bus attack but merely 
expressed sorrow

president bush sped on his way by 
thousands of cheering poles on tuesday hailed the democratic 
reforms and changes taking root in hungary as he pursued an 
extraordinary journey to nourish freedom in communist lands 
we want to work with hungary to continue the changes and 
reforms you are going forward with in your great country the 
president told several thousand people who braved the rain to hear 
his arrival remarks more thousands lined the streets as bushs 
motorcade made its way into the city just minutes after a storm 
with hurricaneforce winds blew through 
later at an extraordinary exchange of dinner toasts with a very 
liberalminded communist leader bush said that in this soviet bloc 
state the key to economic success is letting the market do its 
work 
his host rezso nyers effectively put in charge of the 
government nearly three weeks ago assured bush we are convinced 
that the reform of our economy and the steps we have taken to build 
a market economy offer favorable terms for american enterprise 
there was no hesitation in this communist leaders assertion that 
his country seeking to recover from hard times intends to create 
modern competitive structures and wants the united states to play 
an increasing role in its economic affairs 
on wednesday in a speech at karl marx university bush is 
expected to translate into concrete terms the kind of help the 
united states will extend to hungary including better trade terms 
air force one brought bush and the presidential party to hungary 
where soviet troops once brutally crushed democratic yearnings 
after a tumultuous scene in gdansk poland at the birthplace of the 
solidarity trade union movement 
for those who say that freedom can forever be denied i say let 
them look at poland he told a cheering crowd estimated at 25000 
at a solidarity monument outside the giant lenin shipyards 
he said the struggles by poles against the nazis four decades ago 
and more recently against suppression of solidarity had produced a 
time when dreams can live again 
we have sown new seeds polish leader wojciech jaruzelski 
told bush before the president left on his 90minute flight from one 
iron curtain country to another 
for bush it was an altogether remarkable day and one that took 
him from one eastern bloc country where recent elections placed 
hundreds of opposition members in the parliament to a second where 
reformers and hardline communists now share power bushs trip 
served as a counterpoint to soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs recent 
visits to west germany and france 
like gorbachev bush looked ahead to an opportunity to surmount 
the 45year cold war and end the division in europe 
in budapest bush noted the torrential rains that had eased just 
minutes before his arrival and told the thousands in lajos kossuth 
square he was scrapping his planned speech to speak briefly from 
the heart 
referring to the address he will deliver wednesday at karl marx 
university bush told the audience youll have to listen to me 
tomorrow im sure at some drier time and some drier place 
he added to cheers that long after this rain is gone i am 
going to remember the warmth of the welcome from the people of 
hungary 
at one point bush took off his raincoat during the downpour and 
gave it to an elderly hungarian woman at kossuth square which 
starled secret service agents asked later about what he would have 
used if it had continued to rain bush responded its not going 
to rain anymore its not going to rain on my parade 
later at a state dinner bush toasted his hungarian hosts and 
told them your nation is involved in an unprecedented experiment 
a communist system seeking to evolve towards a more open economy 
towards a more open and pluralistic political system 
in turn nyers the chairman of the communist party told bush 
that the process of democratization has started we want to 
make use of all of the experience gained in the building of the 
american democracy 
the thrust of bushs twoday visit to hungary was largely similar 
to that of his trip to poland showcasing american support for the 
economic and political change sweeping a nation where soviets troops 
once brutally suppressed democratic yearnings proposing improved 
trade opportunities with the united states and strengthening 
cultural and business ties 
in hungary as in poland bushs goal was to nudge a soviet bloc 
country toward private enterprise and the target of his attention 
was a willing pupil 
hungary already encourages private entrepreneurs has a small but 
energetic stock market and permits the sort of free speech that the 
bush administration sees as going handinglove with capitalism 
also like poland the hungarians have soviet troops stationed on 
their territory and like poland the president would like to see 
the forces removed but has not made a big point of it 
bush goes to paris on thursday for an economic summit meeting 
then to the netherlands on monday and tuesday before returning to 
the united states 
in his final hours in poland bush made a pilgrimage to the 
birthplace of the solidarity union movement in gdansk where he was 
cheered by thousands 
today to those who think that hopes can be forever suppressed 
i say let them look at poland to those who think that freedom can 
be forever denied i say let them look at poland and to those who 
think that dreams can be forever repressed i say let them look at 
poland for here in poland the dream is alive he said 
poland is not alone america stands with you he said 
renewing his pledge to help the poles redeem their shattered economy 
and seek greater political freedoms america stands shoulder to 
shoulder with the polish people in solidarity 
long live bush responded the crowd of 25000 people another 
25000 lined the streets of gdansk to cheer bushs motorcade and 
some threw flower petals at his limousine 
it is here in poland where we can work to end the division of 
europe he said it is in your power to help end the division of 
europe 
after the shipyard speech bush joined jaruzelski and laid a 
wreath at the westerplatte monument commemorating where the first 
shots of world war ii were fired 
at the airport jaruzelski hailed the departing president as an 
experienced and farsighted statesman who attracts warm feelings 
he thanked him for the sincere and partnerlike character of the 
talks we held we have sown new seeds 
earlier bush and his wife barbara had lunch at the home of 
solidarity leader lech walesa and his wife danuta 
standing outside in walesas yard afterwards the president 
pledged to ask the nations attending the economic summit meeting in 
paris beginning friday to bolster polands economy with private 
investment assistance 
bush said walesa had asked for 10 billion in private economic 
investment to aid poland not government aid i can give strong 
support for that standing right here in his yard he said of the 
concept 
bush outlined a 115 million program of us aid on monday and 
proposed easier terms of repayment for polands overwhelming 39 
billion foreign debt

britain mourned laurence olivier with tributes and 
fond memories tuesday and theaters from london to the birthplace of 
shakespeare lowered their flags and dimmed their lights 
queen elizabeth ii sent condolences to oliviers family who were 
at the actors bedside when he died peacefully at the age of 82 at 
his home in the village of ashurst 
prime minister margaret thatcher praised his extraordinary 
talents and remembered her favorite olivier roles in hamlet 
henry v and richard iii 
theaters in the west end londons equivalent of broadway dimmed 
their exterior lights for an hour 
the national theater of which olivier was a founder lowered its 
flags removed its normal playbill from its electronic billboard 
overlooking the river thames and replaced it with laurence 
olivier 19071989 
no shows were canceled however that would have been the last 
thing he would have wanted said theater spokesman stephen wood 
in two of the theaters three auditoriums leading actors from 
current productions asked the audience to stand for a moment of 
silence 
the quality of work we do here is mostly due to him veteran 
actor michael bryant told the sellout house in the nationals 
cottesloe theater following a performance of the voysey 
inheritance 
flags also were lowered at theaters in stratford birthplace of 
shakespeare whose works olivier defined for modern mass audiences 
it isnt too much to say that olivier was perhaps the greatest 
man of the theater ever said sir peter hall who followed olivier 
as artistic director of the national theater from 1973 to 1988 
larry oliviers genius shaped the last 50 years 
his genius was also recalled by three of britains famous 
actorknights interviewed by british broadcasting corp television 
sir john gielgud said in an interview from the italian city of 
siena we became in some ways kind of rivals rather than 
colleagues which i was sorry about 
but i wouldnt dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in 
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of 
classical ability and comedy he was a great comedian and a very 
fine tragic actor 
sir alec guinness said he was a giant among actors 
sir john mills said he had more magic on the stage than any 
actor i have ever seen he was extraordinary he was 
irreplaceable 
rosemary harris who had several stage and screen roles opposite 
olivier said its hard to think of a world without laurence 
olivier 
some remarked on his physical courage actor anthony hopkins 
remembered his capacity to electrify people he would hurl himself 
into the role and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body he 
had tremendous athletic daring 
hopkins also praised oliviers openness to new young talents 
i remember him telling me never be afraid to be outrageous 
he said you will always be shot down in flames because people 
are going to dislike you whatever you do it is your fear of being 
criticized that stops you being outrageous 
denis quilley who acted with olivier in the 1971 production of 
eugene oneills long days journey into night recalled how 
night after night audiences would gasp in shock as olivier already 
64 threw himself backward off a table 
mickey rooney whom olivier had called the finest american actor 
said through his publicist the theater and screen will never 
again see the vision of the greatest actor who ever lived 
former president reagan said sir laurence olivier delighted 
millions with his unmatched excellence on the stage and screen 
some of the greatest moments in the history of the performing arts 
came as a result of sir laurences brilliance 
charlton heston a close friend of olivier who worked with him in 
the 1966 film khartoum said naturally im saddened but 
this represents more a resting for larry 
he was an amazingly daring actor the best of our time 
heston said from his home in los angeles i had the privilege of 
working with him on both stage and screen and his advise to me has 
proven an inestimable value 
british tv personality melvyn bragg one of the last to interview 
olivier extensively said he was as english as his own vicarage 
family a man of a thousand faces a powerful dangerous and sexy 
presence on every stage and in some memorable films 
olivier dies cried the newsbills and evening newspapers sold 
fast when rushhour commuters saw the headline 
he was a very great actor of extraordinary power said 
michael denton a physician whenever i thought of him or heard 
his name i saw his stooped figure in black as richard iii 
pat fairbairn a civil servant standing in line for a bus said 
olivier summed up the english theater he had that lovely 
dignified voice 
what impressed me was that his professional colleagues always 
spoke of him with such great respect and admiration fairbairn 
said when they played shakespeare it always seemed to me that 
they were tying to live up to olivier 
joanne james a young london actress looked crushed when she 
heard the news im sad she said hes been a symbol to 
everybody with the energy and dedication he has put into the 
theater ive grown up with him

the senate voted 970 tuesday to extend for as 
long as two years president bushs delayed departure program for 
chinese scholars and students to guarantee safe haven for those 
truly in danger 
the amendment sponsored by the senates democratic and 
republican leaders would write into law the presidents order 
permitting chinese students to remain at least until june 5 1990 
the first anniversary of the crushing of prodemocracy demonstrators 
in beijings tiananmen square 
but it also would expand that order permitting the 40000 
chinese students and scholars now in the united states to remain 
through june 5 1992 unless the president certified that conditions 
had changed permitting them to return in safety before then 
the extension would apply even if the students visas had expired 
the amendment also would waive the present requirement that 
someone in the united states on a nonimmigrant visa the situation 
in which most of the chinese academic community here find themselves 
return to their homeland for two years before seeking to change 
their status to that of potential immigrant 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine said the 
amendment makes other changes intended to meet the concern of 
chinese students that the bush plan forced them to indicate publicly 
an unwillingness to return to chinese now 
according to the students such a statement brands them as 
traitors in the eyes of their government and provides a means for 
chinese officials to track down and pressure students who do not 
choose to return to china at this time mitchell said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the amendment 
reaffirms bushs basic position on the issue that we should not 
arbitrarily send home to a very uncertain fate the thousands of 
chinese students now studying in the united states 
dole said also that the amendment does not do violence to the 
underlying us immigration laws and does not open the gates to 
automatic citizenship for anyone 
but he said it does reflect the best of americas tradition of 
providing safe haven for those truly in danger 
the legislation does not address what might happen if it was 
clear that returning to china might endanger students and scholars 
after the june 5 1992 expiration date 
the amendment was attached to a pending bill making changes in 
us immigration law the entire package will later be considered by 
the house

group and a house subcommittee said it would investigate strikes 
that slashed us coal production 35 percent 
state police were mobilized in southern west virginia where 
vehicles were stoned and shots were fired at nonunion mines 
umw president richard trumka said he was accepting virginia gov 
gerald baliles request that the union and pittston resume 
negotiations under the supervision of a federal mediator with 
trumka and pittston co chairman paul douglas heading the 
negotiating teams pittston coal group president michael odom said 
the company had no comment on the proposal 
at the appropriate time well make a response odom said 
pittston has rejected other requests that the two sides resume talks 
or that douglas become personally involved in the negotiations 
in washington us rep william clay dmo said the house 
subcommittee on labor management relations would begin an 
investigation into the pittston strike 
given the length of the strike the number of workers involved 
the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts and 
the potential effect of the strike on the economy i believe it is 
time for a congressional investigation of the matter clay said 
more than 30000 umw members have been on wildcat strikes 
throughout appalachia and the midwest in support of 1900 union 
members on strike against pittston in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky 
the us energy information agency reported that us coal 
production fell 35 percent in eastern coal fields during the week 
ending july 1 with production in west virginia down 37 percent from 
prestrike levels from 3 million tons in june before the wildcat 
strikes began to 19 million

into the southern part of the state because of violence there but 
would not say how many were being sent 
trumka last week invoked a threeday memorial period and 
tuesday was the midpoint under the national coal contract trumka 
asked union miners east of the mississippi to stay off the job 
through wednesday 
in another development us district judge william beatty in 
alton ill delayed until friday a decision on a national labor 
relations board request that he order most of illinois striking 
coal miners back to work 
i am going to give you the opportunity to demonstrate to me 
your good faith beatty told umw representatives in a courtroom 
packed with miners many in camouflage gear 
but he added if the law is such i will not hesitate to issue 
that temporary restraining order sought by the nlrb which 
contends the wildcat strike represents an illegal secondary boycott 
steve yokich an attorney representing a umw district and locals 
in illinois told beatty some recent developments may lead to the 
conclusion that at the end of a coolingoff period we might not 
have a dispute to deal with

laurence olivier the foremost actor of a 
distinguished generation and the man whose hamlet and henry v 
defined shakespeare for modern mass audiences died tuesday at 82 
a rare fusion of superb classical and extraordinary contemporary 
actor olivier was at home in the plays of shakespeare shaw and 
chekhov as well as movies made from classics such as wuthering 
heights or the thriller marathon man 
knighted and ennobled he was lord olivier when he died but still 
plain laurence olivier on his stage and screen credits he also led 
a distinguished roll call of actorknights and dames who made 
british stage and screen history 
the founding father of britains national theater and twotime 
academy award winner was mourned throughout the acting world as the 
greatest of his time 
it isnt too much to say that olivier was perhaps the greatest 
man of the theater ever said sir peter hall who succeeded him as 
artistic director of the national theater 
olivier was a giant among actors actorknight sir alect 
guinness said in an interview with british broadcasting corp 
television 
he had more magic on the stage than any actor i have ever 
seen sir john mills told the bbc he was extraordinary he was 
irreplaceable 
flags were lowered to halfstaff outside the national theater 
and theaters from londons west end to stratford the birthplace of 
shakespeare dimmed their exterior lights for an hour tuesday night 
in respect 
queen elizabeth ii sent condolences and tributes came from prime 
minister margaret thatcher and former president reagan 
his last few days were very peaceful he died in his sleep at 
noon all the family were at his side said richard olivier the 
27yearold son of his third marriage to joan plowright 
death came at his home near ashurst a village near steyning in 
west sussex about 50 miles south of london 
a private funeral is planned with a public memorial service in 
london later 
olivier was the hero of his own life fighting cancer pleurisy 
and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony he endured two 
miserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright 
contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages guilt and 
drinking 
he was renowned for his daring however many times youd seen 
him it was probably the most dangerously thrilling moment youd 
seen on any stage actor jeremy brett said tuesday 
in eugene oneills long days journey into night olivier 
brought nightly gasps of alarm from the audience by leaping backward 
off a table and crashing to the floor he was then 64 
he was a tragic film hero in wuthering heights and portrayed 
the painful experience of aging in the entertainer on stage and 
a voyage round my father on television 
his genius owed much to a sweeping imagination and attention to 
detail to conjure up king oedipuss unearthly cry of anguish 
olivier said he imagined the sound ermines make when they lick salt 
laid out by their hunters and their tongues stick to the ice 
whatever sex drive he had olivier wrote in his 1982 
autobiography confessions of an actor went into his acting 
you cant be more than one kind of athlete at a time a sexual 
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another 
athletic kind 
his career was highlighted by a triumphant procession of 
shakespearean roles from romeo and juliet in 1935 and 
hamlet in 1937 on stage to a tv production of king lear in 
1983 
he reached mass audiences with title roles and directors credits 
in henry v in 1944 hamlet in 1948 for which he won the 
academy award as best actor and richard iii in 1955 he brought 
othello to the screen in 1965 a year after playing the jealous 
moor on the london stage 
his preparation involved spending months lowering his tenor voice 
by an octave and developing a pantherlike lope he would spend two 
hours a night applying black body makeup 
i had the good fortune to be something of a movie star so 
whatever i did was looked upon with curiosity he wrote somehow 
it worked and i think it had much to do with the way i adapted the 
sound of the lines to the modern ear the filmgoing public many of 
whom had never been in a theater in their lives understood enjoyed 
and were entertained

born may 22 1907 in dorking southwest of london laurence kerr 
olivier was the third child of an anglican clergyman 
his first stage was at home with footlights made of tin cans at 
10 he was brutus in a school performance he donned womens clothes 
at 15 to play katherine in a stratford festival boys production of 
the taming of the shrew 
at 17 he went to birmingham to study acting a bit uncouth 
dame peggy ashcroft remembered him his hair stood on end his 
sleeves were short and he was extremely physical 
his marriage in 1930 to actress jill esmond was a disaster but 
his career took off with roles in noel cowards private lives 
and romeo and juliet where he alternated the roles of romeo and 
mercutio with john gielgud 
i had the voice larry had the legs gielgud recalled years 
later 
in 1937 olivier joined gielgud at the old vic and with ralph 
richardson formed a partnership that remade english theater all 
three were knighted after world war ii 
we became in some ways kind of rivals rather than colleagues 
which i was sorry about gielgud told the bbc on tuesday 
but i wouldnt dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in 
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of 
classical ability and comedy he was a great comedian and a very 
fine tragic actor 
other actorknights of oliviers generation included guinness 
mills sir rex harrison and the equivalent among the great women of 
the stage dame ashcroft dame wendy hiller and dame judi dench 
but olivier was the only one to be elevated to the peerage 
becoming baron olivier of brighton in 1970 the title gave him a 
seat in the house of the lords the upper chamber of parliament the 
only other theatrical peer is actor and theater founder bernard 
miles 
in 1981 the queen awarded olivier the order of merit which is 
limited to 24 living members he was the only actor to hold it 
other holders include violinist sir yehudi menuhin novelist graham 
greene atomic scientist lord penney and jet engine inventor sir 
frank whittle 
oliviers stardom was assured by his move to hollywood in 1939 to 
make wuthering heights it was a towering success but also an 
invaluable lesson in acting 
he strutted around the set indulging in appalling overacting 
until director william wyler shouted what do you think you are 
doing you think you are in the opera house 
i suppose this anemic little medium cant take great acting 
olivier replied huffily the set was engulfed in laughter 
four decades later working on marathon man olivier was 
astonished that dustin hoffman had gone sleepless for two nights to 
look properly disheveled dear boy said olivier why dont 
you try acting its so much easier 
in 1939 olivier appeared with vivien leigh in a new york 
production of romeo and juliet they were married two years 
later after he divorced his first wife 
again the marriage was a debacle olivier said he once battered 
her against a wall cutting her head and nearly killing her he said 
he also considered suicide 
they were divorced in 1961 and olivier wed actress joan 
plowright with whom he finally found happiness they had a son 
richard and two daughters tamsin and juliekate all three study 
or work in the theater 
in the 1960s and 1970s olivier had scores of memorable roles 
from the fading comic archie rice in john osbornes the 
entertainer to astrov in chekhovs uncle vanya to the nazi 
who tortures dustin hoffman in marathon man 
he offended some devotees by taking cameo parts in hollywood 
potboilers but explained he needed the money 
charlton heston a close friend of olivier who worked with him in 
the 1966 film khartoum said tuesday from his home in los 
angeles that olivier was an amazingly daring actor the best of 
our time i had the privilege of working with him on both stage and 
screen and his advise to me has proven an inestimable value 
oliviers last film appearance was as an aged wheelchairbound 
war veteran in the 1988 war requiem based on the oratorio by 
composr benjamin britten 
his voice was heard publicly for the last time in a taperecorded 
contribution to save the rose theater the remnants of a theater 
where shakespeare is believed to have acted 
borrowing from the famous line he delivered in his film of 
henry v olivier said cry god for harry england and the 
rose

iran accused saudi arabia on tuesday 
of planting the bombs that killed one person and wounded 16 near 
islams holiest shrine during the annual pilgrimage to mecca 
moslems condemned the bombings monday near the grand mosque but 
no arab nation openly accused iran of involvement 
a previously unknown group calling itself the angry arab 
generation claimed responsibility and said in statement delivered 
to a western news agency office in beirut lebanon we 
consider that this is merely a warning to the pigs rulers of the 
arab peninsula 
our action comes within the framework of a final warning for 
the treacherous saud royal family in case they persist in their 
treachery we shall settle our accounts with them directly by 
killing them said the statement typewritten in arabic 
the group also claimed responsibility for an explosion in nearby 
jiddah saudi media had not reported an explosion in that city 
tehran earlier said the explosions in mecca were intended to 
discredit iran which is boycotting the pilgrimage or hajj because 
of a feud with saudi arabia 
saudi arabia target of an almost daily barrage of propaganda by 
irans leaders and media in recent weeks limited its reaction to 
saying this criminal perpetration at a sacred spot is 
regrettable 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the united states was appalled by the bombings 
the saudis have repeatedly accused iranian zealots of causing 
trouble during the hajj and broke relations with iran in april 1988 
citing subversion and terrorism 
the dead man was identified as taleb khan gamallah of pakistan 
the injured were four saudis three pakistanis five bangladeshis 
two egyptians a turk and a british citizen of bangladeshi origin 
saudi security officials said the casualties were mostly pilgrims 
and that two were in critical condition they said several suspects 
were being interrogated 
hussein musavi prime minister of iran described the two 
explosions at 10 pm monday as an effort by the saudi regime to 
create a climate of suppression and repression said tehrans 
official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
a statement from the iranian foreign ministry urged pilgrims in 
mecca to protest the bombings which it blamed on the united 
states and its agents in the region a reference to prowestern 
saudi arabia 
when the bombs went off hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were 
praying and walking in the grounds of grand mosque around the kaaba 
a square building draped in cloth that is islams holiest shrine 
the saudi statement said they exploded on the main road to the 
grand mosque and on an overpass near the mosque 
diplomats said the bombs were believed to be crude devices with 
timing mechanisms the saudi security sources said the explosives 
used were of the type that makes a loud bang but causes little 
damage 
officials set up checkpoints and changed pilgrims routes but 
allowed the traditional hajj rites to continue 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of irans parliament said maybe 
the saudis themselves did it to free themselves of the pressure from 
true moslems for depriving iran from participating in the hajj 
president ali khamenei said the agents of the usa and 
israel again violated the sanctity of divine sanctuary by 
exploding two bombs in the holy city of mecca tehran radio 
reported 
no doubt this crime has been committed by the house of 
alsaud khamenei said referring to the saudi royal family 
iran has demanded the saudi royal family be stripped of 
custodianship of the holy shrines at mecca and medina 
in protest of saudi limits on the number of pilgrims for a second 
year it also called on moslems earlier to disrupt the annual 
rituals attended by 18 million pilgrims from 80 countries 
the iranian news agency said the purpose of the bombs was 
distracting world opinion from the second anniversary of the 
deaths of more than 400 pilgrims in mecca july 31 1987 
most were iranian zealots killed when saudi security forces 
opened fire on rioters saudi arabia said iranians started the 
riots but iran claims the pilgrims were massacred 
riyadh thinks it can overshadow its previous crime by 
committing a new one said kayhan a masscirculation newspaper in 
tehran 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq based in iraq 
blamed the explosions on iran specifically on fanatical followers 
of fundamantalist patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died 
june 3 
in abu dhabi foreign undersecretary sheik hamdan bin zayed al 
nahyan said the united arab emirates was shocked at the news of 
the bombs and condemned the terrorist act which contravenes 
islamic teachings and all humanitarian rules 
a foreign ministry official in qatar condemned the bombings and 
called on all moslem nations to confront these terrorist acts 
which are directed against the security of pilgrims in holy lands 
the hajj has been turbulent turbulent since khomeini gained power 
in iran in february 1979 
religious extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca that year 
and held it for two weeks 
saudi forces stormed the mosque and more than 250 people were 
killed including 100 extremists saudi authorities later beheaded 
63 more 
in 1986 the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary 
guards who posed as pilgrims and tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives

judges here have begun basing sentences for 
people convicted of dealing crack cocaine on the suggestions of 
neighbors and other community members 
were getting longer and more creative sentences and the 
letters are strengthening our resolve in these cases also said 
hennepin county attorney tom johnson 
johnson cited the sentence of a 20yearold drug defendant to 
nearly two years in prison rather than the probation called for by 
state sentencing guidelines after the judge received three letters 
from concerned citizens 
in another case in addition to 90 days in jail on a drug charge 
minneapolis resident eli acevedo was ordered to have no more than 
six visitors per day at his home and none at night for five years 
judge ann montgomery devised that sentence after receiving a 
letter from a neighborhood group which described allday and 
allnight disruption caused by a stream of visitors to acevedos 
house 
the county policy mirrors a yearold state law that requires that 
before sentencing probation officers assess the community impact of 
narcotics in drugdealing cases 
montgomery said she does not always follow victims 
recommendations but she likes to know what the community is 
thinking before issuing a sentence 
in another sentence based on a letter to a judge jerome gregory 
got 90 days in a workhouse and was ordered not to return to the 
neighborhood where he was caught with crack for three years 
dave murrin a senior attorney in the county public defenders 
office said he does not believe public opinion should be used to 
sway a sentence 
it is like the peoples court for minor crimes in russia 
murrin said our system of justice is not designed for individual 
retribution we are supposed to establish uniformity

china on tuesday refused to rule out a trial and 
further punishment for zhao ziyang who was ousted as communist 
party chief for opposing the military crackdown that crushed 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
his problem is still being investigated government spokesman 
yuan mu said at the first news conference by a highranking official 
since troops on june 34 marched on tiananmen square and attacked 
unarmed demonstrators 
on wednesday china urged the rival government on taiwan not to 
let chinas harsh suppression of dissent stand in the way of 
improving ties between the two nations the appeal in a frontpage 
commentary in the communist party peoples daily came one day after 
the government expelled a taiwanese reporter 
when the party central committee ousted zhao as secretarygeneral 
on june 24 it accused him of supporting the protesters and 
splitting the party and said his case would be dealt with 
internally since then however official criticism has escalated 
fueling speculation zhao may stand trial 
one major government report last week accused zhaos aides of 
collaborating with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow 
the government it stopped short of also accusing zhao of plotting a 
coup 
yuan stressed the party charges and decision to treat zhaos case 
as an internal disciplinary matter are not final 
how the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided 
according to the findings of the investigation he told more than 
100 chinese and foreign reporters 
premier li peng a key force behind the crackdown was quoted 
last week as saying zhao remained at his home putting him on trial 
would be an extreme measure taken only if zhao and his supporters 
are considered a continuing threat 
a trial may force the disclosure of details about the power 
struggle that preceded the army attack and could turn zhao into a 
popular hero the government says hundreds of people were killed 
mostly soldiers chinese students and western diplomats say 
thousands of unarmed civilians were slain 
in an interview with cbs television tuesday student leader wuer 
kaixi said optimistically it would be two to three years before 
there was another chance to push for democratic reform in china 
conservatively it would be seven to eight years he said from 
hiding in paris 
also tuesday authorities deported two reporters one american 
and one taiwanese and gave a second taiwanese reporter 48 hours to 
leave all are accused of violating martial law bans on reporting 
activity 
they bring to nine the number of reporters ordered to leave china 
since june 4 all but two were in china on tourist visas 
the two taiwanese huang tehpei and hsu lu of the independence 
evening post also are accused of trying to help a student protest 
leader escape china authorities put huang on a plane to hong kong 
tuesday morning eight days after arresting him ms hsu said she 
would leave wednesday 
huang reported meeting with the student wang dan on july 2 he 
said in hong kong that security officials told him they had arrested 
wang however authorities refused to comment on wangs status 
mark hopkins a reporter for the us governmentrun voice of 
america also flew to hong kong he is the second voa reporter 
expelled since the crackdown 
zhaos successor as party chief jiang zemin tried tuesday to 
reassure hong kong residents frightened by what the use of harsh 
military tactics may portend for the british colony that reverts to 
chinese rule in 1997 many are trying to emigrate 
we practice our socialism and you may practice your 
capitalism the official xinhua news agency quoted jiang as 
telling three members of committees drafting hong kongs post1997 
constitution 
but he warned you should not transplant capitalism onto the 
countrys mainland hundreds of thousands of hong kong residents 
have marched and signed petitions to protest the military attack 
many donated funds to the students and helped fugitives escape 
at his news conference yuan said martial law imposed may 20 in 
central beijing cannot be lifted yet because the struggle has not 
ended he said some people stole guns from army trucks during the 
june 34 attack and may cause further unrest 
there have been unconfirmed reports of attacks on troops since 
army guns silenced protesters one westerner recently reported 
seeing a naked body possibly of a soldier floating in a canal near 
his home 
but yuan said foreigners should feel secure in beijing and said 
it would be unwise to wait until martial law is lifted to return 
thousands of chinabased foreign businessmen and their families fled 
beijing in the week after the army attack most tourists have stayed 
away 
of course there will be a time limit for martial law but even 
i cant say exactly when that will be yuan said the government 
still has not lifted martial law in tibets capital lhasa imposed 
after antichinese protests there march 5

the city council passed legislation tuesday 
limiting outside income for top city officials but not before some 
council members slammed the bill as a thinly veiled attempt to 
discourage jesse jackson from running for mayor 
the bill proposed by mayoral hopeful john ray a member of the 
council limits the outside income for the mayor and council members 
to 10000 per year 
another candidate for mayor council chairman david clarke 
succeeded in attaching an amendment that sets a 10000 annual limit 
for royalty earnings by the mayor and council chairman 
jackson whose advisors have said he is strongly considering 
running for mayor in 1990 was traveling in egypt and could not be 
reached for comment 
the mayors job pays 82500 a year 
one council member called the bill a cheap shot at jackson 
who earns most of his 200000 annual income from giving speeches 
i think it looks like a cheap shot and we always look foolish 
when it looks like were trying to keep someone from running said 
frank smith it usually turns out to be a shortsighted mistake 
ray said the bill is intended to prevent conflicts of interest 
he has said he began work on the bill last year after residents 
residents criticized the council for voting itself a pay raise but 
he did not introduce it until jackson began to be mentioned as a 
possible candidate 
the bill passed on tuesday by voice vote without debate

house and senate negotiators trying to 
reconcile differences in a 157 billion taxpayer bailout of savings 
and loan losses agreed tuesday to provide civil fines of up to 1 
million a day for bank and sampl fraud 
the negotiators aiming at having a bill ready for president 
bushs signature before congress recesses in early august also 
eliminated a 2500 per day cap on civil fines for minor violations 
that was in the senate version of the legislation as approved in 
april 
under the current law the maximum civil fine for bank or sampl 
fraud is generally 1000 
as approved tuesday by the housesenate conferees maximum fines 
for minor violations of federal banking and sampl laws would be raised 
to 5000 with provisions for penalties up to 25000 a day if the 
violations resulted in substantial losses 
the bill also raises maximum criminal penalties from one year in 
jail and a 5000 fine to five years and fines of up to 1 million 
for each violation 
fraud in making loans with federally insured deposits has been 
cited by the general accounting office as the single biggest 
contributor to the sampl crisis and the failure of more than 500 
thrift institutions in recent years 
over the objections of attorney general dick thornburgh the 
negotiators also agreed to mandate that the justice department 
maintain a special fraud task force in texas where most of the past 
abuses occurred 
a call by the house for a second task force in los angeles was 
deleted while senate members of the conference committee accepted a 
house provision increasing to 75 million bushs initial proposal of 
50 million in new appropriations to prosecute sampl fraud 
the negotiators put off the two most controversial issues until 
thursday how to finance the bailout and how much of their own money 
sampl owners should have to at risk to continue qualifying for federal 
insurance of their depositors funds 
sen donald riegle dmich the chairman of both the conference 
and the senate banking committee tried tuesday to tackle a third 
major dispute socalled special interest provisions inserted into 
the two versions of the bill by various lawmakers over the past four 
months 
its decision time time to get some of these tough issues out 
in the open and see where we are he said 
however decisions on them also were postponed when it became 
clear there were major differences in interpretations of what 
constituted a special interest 
one mans special interest is another mans scam said rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee 
but sen alan cranston dcalif said many of the provisions 
labeled special interest are actually in the publics interest 
because they would allow some institutions to remain open and avoid 
further depletion of federal deposit insurance funds 
just before passing its version of the bill last month the house 
struck from the bill more than half a dozen provisions aimed 
specifically at helping companies such as sears citicorp chemical 
bank first interstate bank of los angeles 
however the instigator of that move rep jim leach riowa 
said wednesday he saw some mischief in separate lists of 17 to 
20 special interest provisions prepared by senate and house staffs 
included on the lists were exemptions still in the house bill for 
sampls acquired by ford motor co and savings banks in new york and 
new england 
there also is a host of the provisions in the senate bill aimed 
at helping american express sears the john hancock insurance co 
ford citicorp first interstate merrill lynch paine webber and 
individual sampls in florida tennessee california and texas

the district of columbia city council on 
tuesday canceled a vote on landmark legislation that would have held 
handgun manufacturers financially liable for injuries and deaths 
caused in shootings 
judiciary committee chairman wilhelmina rolark said she withdrew 
the bill because court cases in which plaintiffs are suing handgun 
manufacturers have not yet been resolved 
but the bill the first of its kind in the nation faced an 
unfriendly reception in congress which has the power to review and 
reject any law passed by the council 
the vote postponement came in the councils last legislative 
session before the summer recess which means the matter cannot be 
reconsidered until the council reconvenes in september 
the liability bill given preliminary approval by an 84 vote two 
weeks ago grew out of frustration over the drugrelated crime wave 
that has surged through the nations capital 
through tuesday 229 people had been killed in washington this 
year compared with 159 by the same time last year in 1988 a record 
372 persons were killed 
police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs

the exxon valdez was kept offshore tuesday 
because of an 18milelong oil slick that apparently leaked from the 
tanker despite exxons assurances that the ship was cleaned before 
leaving alaska 
they were wrong the ship is not squeaky clean said coast 
guard cmdr jack scarborough captain of the port of san diego 
thats a discrepancy i cant explain 
exxon officials agreed that the exxon valdez the source of the 
nations worst oil spill was probably the source of the oil slick 
off san diego scarborough said the oil was likely washed out of 
the ships damaged hull by seawater he said 
the tanker was kept 50 miles offshore while officials worked to 
clean its cargo tanks of oil before the oil slick was discovered 
monday the ship had been scheduled to enter san diego bay on 
tuesday 
shes not going anywhere said coast guard lt larry solberg 
weve told them they cant come any closer 
the exxon valdez was steaming at about 1 knot as coast guard 
officials reviewed test results of samples taken from the oil in the 
ocean solberg said 
the slick and five steel flaps discovered hanging from the 
tankers bottom monday were expected to delay the ships entry into 
the bay by at least several days 
underwater video also showed at least three rocks embedded in the 
tankers hull said coast guard petty officer dennis hall 
one is the size of a volkswagen he said officials believe 
the rocks were from the reef in prince william sound alaska that 
the tanker ran into march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil 
the oily sheen estimated at 18 miles long on monday had shrunk 
to 10 miles and 50 yards wide by tuesday and extended behind the 
tanker 
the environmental impact on fish and wildlife was expected to be 
negligible officials said 
im not going to say it isnt harming the environmentsaid 
reed smith of the california department of fish and game but we 
havent seen oiled birds or any other evidence of damaged wildlife 
officials planned to flood the cargo tanks with seawater pushing 
oil up inside the vessel scarborough said 
once the oil problem is solved the tanker can be brought into 
calm waters so divers can repair the steel flaps hanging as much as 
40 feet beneath the tanker too low to travel through the san diego 
bay channel 
the 987foot ship is to be repaired at national steel and 
shipbuilding co where it was built in 1986 
exxon spokeswoman carrie chassin said she was not sure when it 
would be cleared to dock the tanker under tow since leaving alaska 
on june 23 had an uneventful trip until the final leg of its 
2500mile journey

federal regulators said tuesday that the energy 
department may be giving too little attention to issues that could 
disqualify nevadas yucca mountain as the site for the nations 
first highlevel nuclear waste dump 
nuclear regulatory commission staff members said they were 
generally pleased with the departments plan for determining the 
suitability of the site as a permanent graveyard for radioactive 
waste from commercial and defense nuclear reactors 
but they raised two crucial objections to the plan and cited 
several less urgent concerns 
commissioner kenneth rogers said he was especially worried that 
the energy department was not ensuring that the most critical issues 
get settled early 
among what rogers described as killer issues is whether there 
are active geologic faults or potentially destabilizing volcanic 
activity in the area that would disqualify yucca mountain about 100 
miles northwest of las vegas 
another is how quickly moisture might dissolve waste and carry 
radioactive atoms into groundwater supplies 
rogers said he was concerned that once construction gained a 
certain momentum a really fundamental question somehow gets lost 
in the dust 
initial construction work is scheduled to start in november and 
the energy department is to decide by 1994 whether the site is 
suitable if the nrc granted a license wastes would start moving 
into the site in 2003 
robert bernero commission director of nuclear materials safety 
and safeguards said in an interview that energy secretary james d 
watkins was reconsidering that timetable as part of a fresh look 
at the entire program 
the nevada government is strongly opposed to the program gov 
bob miller recently signed a bill making it illegal for any 
government body to store highlevel radioactive waste in the state 
bernero said the nrc had concluded that the energy department had 
produced a fundamentally useable plan for collecting and 
analyzing the data necessary to decide whether yucca mountain was a 
suitable site 
he said the staff had two key objections to the plan it didnt 
include an adequate means of assuring the quality of the data 
collected and there may be flaws in the design of an experimental 
shaft to be drilled on the site 
in a related development the energy department ordered sandia 
national laboratories one of the major contractors on the project 
to stop work until it corrected a technical flaw in its 
qualitycontrol program 
meanwhile sen john glenn dohio introduced legislation to 
give states authority over cleanup of hazardous wastes from the 
departments nuclear weapons plants without going to court the bill 
would demand a concrete cleanup schedule whenever government weapons 
plants are closed 
the bill was aimed at ohios fernald uraniumprocessing plant and 
radioactive wastes at the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant 
glenn also proposed increasing the power of the defense nuclear 
safety board protecting the energy departments office of 
environmental safety and health from future administrative 
reorganizations and repealing a provision preventing the energy 
department from paying environmental penalties

a grand jury returned a murder 
indictment tuesday against a woman whose two infant daughters were 
killed three years apart under nearly identical circumstances a 
prosecutor said 
in both cases paula sims 29 had told police the babies were 
abducted by a masked gunman while their father was away at work 
the madison county grand jury charged mrs sims with two counts 
of firstdegree murder in the suffocation death last spring of 
6weekold heather sims said states attorney william haine 
multiple murder counts in a single death are not unusual in illinois 
heathers body was found may 3 in a trash can near west alton 
mo about 10 miles north of st louis 
mrs sims was arrested at her parents home shortly after the 
indictments were returned said county sheriffs sgt don wein 
she had been free on 250000 bond after being charged earlier 
with concealing heathers death she also was out on 100000 bond 
after being charged in neighboring jersey county with concealing the 
death of her first daughter loralei who disappeared 13 days after 
her birth in 1986 
circuit judge edward ferguson granted a prosecution request that 
mrs sims be held without bond haine said 
the first count in heathers case alleges that mrs sims intended 
to kill the girl said assistant states attorney don weber the 
second count alleges that mrs sims committed an act she knew had 
the strong probability of ending in death or great bodily harm 
weber said the second charge is a backup in case the defense 
contends there was an accidental element in heathers death he said 
the grand jury is still investigating heathers death and the 
involvement of her father robert 37 the prosecutor said 
police have said sims told them he believes his wife may have 
killed their daughters accidentally witnesses have said mrs sims 
wanted to give birth to sons and was unhappy about the girls 
heather was suffocated by someone who placed a hand over her 
face the pathologist who performed an autopsy on the infant has 
concluded 
in june 1986 the simses told police that a masked gunman broke 
into their home and abducted loralei the decomposed remains of a 
baby believed to be loralei were found several days later near the 
couples home in brighton a rural jersey county community 
earlier tuesday mrs sims mother nylene blew was ordered for 
the second time to testify before the grand jury after being granted 
immunity from prosecution 
she spent about two hours behind closed doors in the grand jury 
room but it was not clear whether she testified 
mrs blew refused to testify monday citing her constitutional 
right against selfincrimination

said whether it be moisture or residue from plants that burn it 
will transmit electricity 
elsewhere in utah nearly 400 firefighters finished a fire line

over gov kay orr said at chadron about 22 miles east of

stellos selection runs counter to bushs professed desire to

with its guiltfree programming of 
documentaries travelogues literary adaptations and news the 
discovery channel has become the fastestgrowing cable channel in 
the nation in the past two years 
unlike network television which relies on ratings to attract 
advertisers the discovery channel is partially underwritten by 
cable operators 
we have a very discriminating audience and we want to get as 
many people into that discriminating audience as possible but were 
not willing to sacrifice the word discriminating said greg 
moyer senior vice president in charge of programming for the 
marylandbased channel 
people have written us who say at last i can watch tv all 
night long and not feel guilty said john hendricks the 
channels founder 
the discovery channel which broadcasts 18 hours of mostly 
foreignproduced programs daily went on the air in 1985 with a 
viewer base of 156000 homes 
now it is available in 406 million us homes according to 
figures from the ac nielsen co the channel is available in 78 
percent of cable homes and 45 percent of all homes it has 
maintained the fastest growth rate of any cable channel for two 
straight years according to nielsen 
the discovery channel is a boon to cable operators looking to 
bring in new viewers because says hendricks tdc programming tends 
to appeal to viewers who arent particularly avid television 
watchers the channel is promoted in print through tdc a monthly 
magazine that features background articles relating to discovery 
channel programs 
hendricks a former university fundraiser conceived the idea 
for the channel while researching a fundraising project and 
discovering the wealth of documentaries available to programmers 
among the programs viewers may see on any given day are 
documentaries focusing on travel adventure and nature hendricks 
said programs on animals known to eat people such as sharks and 
bears have been among the most popular the channels shark 
week of programming proved sucessful enough to merit a repeat this 
month 
the channels answer to the nightly news world monitor 
produced by the christian science monitor takes a global approach 
to current events and has received critical acclaim 
the channel became the first us television outlet to present 
the soviet news program vremya nightly for a week during the 
gorbachevreagan summit the channel has also presented a critically 
praised sevenpart historical look at the bible and given viewers a 
live look at a coral reef in the red sea 
weve defined the whole niche of documentary television 
hendricks said 
when i first put together a proposal there were some people 
exploring a travel channel a science channel and others those were 
all subniches what weve done is define an entire niche especially 
with the word discovery 
the discovery channel is very good television although i think 
its somewhat limited in scope said art chapman television 
critic for the fort worth texas startelegram and president of the 
television critics association 
i would not want my television dial welded to the discovery 
channel but if youre saying you can rely on it for good 
dependable quality programming yes in that way it is guiltfree 
television 
hendricks and moyer both said they take a freewheeling approach 
to programming a live shot from an african watering hole where 
viewers would pop in from time to time to see what is happening is 
planned for september 
i think there is something magic about live tv hendricks 
said i remember the first moment when there were live 
coasttocoast shots side by side i think its something to be able 
to sit in your living room and be on the plains of the serengeti

civil rights battles no longer are being 
fought in the streets of birmingham where snarling police dogs and 
fire hoses trained on black demonstrators made the city a symbol of 
segregationism in the 1960s 
today the battlefield is the courtroom and civil rights leaders 
view with alarm us supreme court decisions threatening 
affirmativeaction and minority business setaside plans and 
limiting challenges to racial harassment 
the high court ruled 54 in june that white birmingham 
firefighters have the right to go to court to challenge as reverse 
discrimination an affirmative action plan that helped increase the 
number of black firefighters and officers 
the ruling is part of a carefully designed plan to turn the 
clock back on affirmative action period everywhere says richard 
arrington birminghams first black mayor its going to be a 
long hot summer 
the city also will be among those affected by a supreme court 
ruling that a richmond va setaside program was reverse 
discrimination in a third ruling that worried civil rights leaders 
the court prohibited in a north carolina case the use of an 
antidiscrimination law by victims of racial harassment 
the legal battle over birminghams affirmativeaction plan could 
last 10 to 15 years said arrington who wants congress to let 
cities continue affirmative action and put behind us this old 
bitter fight about race 
birmingham a city of 276000 55 percent black began its 
program eight years ago now 118 of 497 firefighters are black as 
are 38 of 151 officers 
the city contended it has acted under a courtordered consent 
decree and that whites had a chance to complain when the plan was 
being considered but did not white firefighters say they werent 
party to the lawsuit that led to the plan and the supreme court 
ruling allows them to challenge it in court 
we were happy with it said lt charlie brush president of 
the birmingham firefighters association local a number of those who 
originally challenged affirmative action are still in the department 
and many havent been promoted others left because they were passed 
over in favor of blacks 
we know this doesnt end the case necessarily brush said 
jackie barton a black captain withdrew from the union when it 
hired attorneys for the white firefighters i realize union 
members arent going to agree with everything the union does but i 
didnt want to pay dues to help keep myself down 
barton who was hired in 1977 said that without affirmative 
action he probably wouldnt have been promoted to captain since he 
was 39th on a test for applicants he called the ruling a 
wrongdoing to all city employees 
basing promotions only on seniority would be unfair to blacks 
barton said because the city did not start largescale minority 
hiring until the 1970s 
firefighters can miss more questions on qualifying tests if 
they have more seniority he said when i received my first 
promotion candidates received one point for each year of seniority 
blacks havent had the opportunity to be on the job as long as some 
firefighters 
union attorney ray fitzpatrick said the ruling was a step toward 
ending racebased quota promotions that discriminate against 
whites the union has not developed an alternate hiring plan he 
said birmingham has never been willing to engage in any 
meaningful discussions with the white employees 
the firefighters case is expected to go to us district court 
here for trial but no date has been set fitzpatrick said the white 
firefighters would like to work with the city to settle the case and 
avoid a trial perhaps now that they have this additional guidance 
from the court they will be willing 
any settlement would have to include back pay seniority and 
promotions for those who have been passed over he said people 
are being denied advancement in their jobs solely on the basis of 
race and thats wrong 
birmingham also is trying to settle issues raised by the supreme 
courts ruling in the richmond case 
a contractors group associated general contractors has been 
fighting a program that sets aside 35 percent of city work for 
minority companies agc won a state court ruling overturning the 
program but the state supreme court halted implementation of the 
lowercourt order pending a city appeal the sides are talking to a 
mediator in an effort to settle the matter 
the city has considered changing from voluntary goals to a 
program that would set aside a fixed percentage of contracts for 
disadvantaged firms instead of just blackowned firms the idea is 
that this would survive legal challenges since it would give no 
preferences based on race 
agc claims the city has coerced white contractors into using 
blackowned businesses as subcontractors on city projects city 
officials deny this claiming the city is trying to correct decades 
of discrimination 
during the state court hearing agc attorney jim starnes said his 
clients were at a disadvantage because almighty big brother 
government over here can do anything it wants to do 
arrington said it was important to try to help its black 
businesses the need is not only tied to the issue of fairness and 
justice he said the need is also tied to the citys need for 
economic development 
birmingham discriminated against blacks in the 1960s and before 
in housing business employment and voting arrington said 
citing the tests once given to discourage blacks from registering 
to vote he added i grew up watching my mother and father and a 
number of adults study a long list of questions they hoped theyd 
know the answers to when they got to the board of registrars

in some ways economic slowdowns get a bad rap 
ask your nextdoor neighbors who probably are thanking their stars 
that the slowdown has brought down interest rates 
like millions of others these neighbors probably have an 
interestsensitive home mortgage that was beginning to scare the 
wits out of them over the past couple of years it has been rising 
along with their fears 
with good reason many homeowners have mortgages that at the 
upper rate limits are capable of consuming half their takehome 
pay that say most financial advisers leaves an insufficient 
amount for other necessities 
it didnt begin that way when they obtained the mortgage it was 
at a rate that probably took no more than 28 percent of their 
takehome pay but even at that rate they knew it would be a 
struggle because they had other bills 
as recently as last spring some forecasters were talking about 
even higher rates spreading terror among homeowners in some 
instances higher rates would mean negative amortization instead 
of being reduced the loan would enlarge 
a survey in april for the international association of financial 
planning showed that fears of inability to pay the home mortgage 
became the chief financial concern of american households 
asked to name their two or three biggest financial concerns the 
households interviewed put payments on the house first a year 
earlier it had ranked behind monthly bills medical bills and 
inflation 
among households with incomes of 50000 and up mortgage fears 
more than tripled according to the survey which was conducted for 
the iafp by the gallup organization 
while the survey didnt say so many of these home loans were 
obtained at firstyear rates or rates that would be suddenly 
adjusted upwards for subsequent years 
many borrowers didnt mind that they would have a year to 
prepare and in that time they looked forward to the value of their 
property soaring that was a soothing thought its the way people 
think when times are good 
the real estate market changed in the meantime housing prices 
have actually fallen in some areas especially where prices are high 
and incomes have failed to keep pace and interest rates are sharply 
higher 
in the three years the iafp survey has been conducted payments 
on the house has always ranked among the top sources of anxiety 
it was listed first by 19 percent of respondents but by 21 percent 
of the higherincome segment 
that survey showed a great deal of other financial stress in the 
lives of americans 
fortythree percent for example said they were concerned with 
outliving their retirement money when asked what plans they had for 
retirement 25 percent of the respondents said they didnt know and 
a third of them said they expected someone in their families to need 
longterm medical care 
in such a stressful environment an economic retrenchment that 
brings down the monthly mortgage payment cant be all bad

at least twice a week for 12 years 
baritone stephen bardsley has made the 50mile drive to temple 
square the crossroads of the west that is home to the venerable 
mormon tabernacle choir 
he is paid no money but as a member of the worlds largest and 
bestknown choir bardsley has sung at presidential inaugurations 
and the olympic games and in tours all over the world 
the commuting might be tiresome but never the singing 
once you sit in that seat you just get away from the whole 
world and you get your soul into singing for the whole world 
said bardsley 48 a customer service manager at a computer company 
in provo 
the choir has been singing for the world for a long time 
sunday is the 325voice choirs 60th anniversary broadcast of 
music and the spoken word which with 3126 live sunday 
performances is the longestrunning program in the history of 
american radio 
president bush and former president reagan whose inaugurations 
featured the choir will deliver videotaped tributes 
the broadcasts are heard by millions on about 400 domestic 
stations as well as in europe on armed forces radio network and in a 
dozen nations with englishspeaking programs the choir also is seen 
on scores of syndicated telecasts 
nbc carried the program from 1929 to 1932 when utahs ksl radio 
switched to cbs radio since then cbs has provided the program to 
its affiliates as a public service for a broad range of listeners 
its very wellreceived said john burrows a radio network 
vice president 
the choir had its genesis in 1847 in the arid salt lake valley 
where brigham young led his mormon pioneers many of them immigrants 
who brought along the rich musical traditions of the british isles 
indeed when young sent bands of farmers out to colonize the 
surrounding territory he insisted each group should include a 
metalworker and a woodworker and there must be someone who can 
handle music so that people can sing said jerold ottley 55 a 
whitehaired tenor and the choirs conductor since 1975 
but ottley said the choirs identity was sealed in 1867 on 
completion of the domed tabernacle a 250footlong 150footwide 
auditorium with acoustics so refined that the curved walls will 
carry a whisper from end to end 
as always the choirs members must be active in the 67 
millionmember church of jesus christ of latterday saints as with 
the faiths lay clergy choir service is considered a calling 
second alto jeanette watkins 54 is a salt lake tax attorney 
mother of four and a nineyear veteran who shares the devotion of 
her fellow singers she recalls 1988s grueling threeweek tour of 
the south pacific and a march sojourn to disneyworld at the peak of 
the tax season 
i thought if the lord wants me to go to florida ill just get 
my work done she said 
the choir itself is a nonprofit organization financed by 
donations and proceeds from tours and more than 116 record albums 
the selections range from frontier mormon hymns and patriotic songs 
to handels messiah and operatic overtures 
five records are millionsellers including the disc with the 
choirs signature piece the battle hymn of the republic which 
won a grammy award 
a staff of 24 handles logistics and business matters the 
production company is bonneville international the churchs 
communications arm and owner of ksl 
ottley a fulbright scholar with a doctorate in music pedagogy 
took the podium shortly after the resignation of the choirs 
conductor of 17 years richard p condie 
where condie concentrated on rich tonal qualities ottley has 
emphasized discipline and precision no easy task with an average 
of 290 voices singing 350 pieces in 145 rehearsals and performances 
a year 
he also implemented rigorous auditions to test a candidates 
ability to meet demands on time and energy as well as musical 
skills specifically the ability to read and quickly assimilate a 
part 
by decree of church leadership volunteers must be at least 30 
old enough to have established families and careers they can serve 
20 years or until age 60 
older singers possess both the discipline and mature voices 
necessary for a choir that has no doubts about its place in music 
the choir has become a part of the fabric of the nation 
culturally and a great deal is expected of it because its been 
around so long ottley said we are an amateur organization 
participating in a professional arena 
we also are a representative of the church an ambassador he 
said we have to represent the church in a dignified 
approachable yet appropriate way and that requires excellence 
backing the choir when it is at home is the tabernacles familiar 
206rank fivekeyboard aeolianskinner organ with its more than 
11600 gleaming pipes 
by no means the largest or oldest such instrument the organ 
nevertheless possesses dynamic levels contrasts subtlety of 
tonal shadings from the softest whisper to the most dramatic 
fanfares said john longhurst one of three choir organists 
for 40 years richard l evans delivered the nondenominational 
sermons that punctuate the halfhour radio program he was succeeded 
in 1972 by ksls corporate news director j spencer kinard 
for bardsley the baritone from provo membership in the choir is 
a privileged extension of the mormon traditions of spirituality and 
patriotism 
in the mormon faith we have a way of bearing our testimony 
about the things that we feel and we can do that through music 
he said its just a way of talking to people of communicating

he says there is only limited desire to use the j7 permanently 
dr devries is still approved by the fda to do three more 
permanent implants and hasnt done a case in more than three 
years jarvik says he seems to have little further interest in 
doing it 
jarvik is now in new york working on a new permanently 
implantable artificial heart the jarvik2000 
the national institutes of health under political pressure 
announced last july that it was reversing its planned suspension of 
a 20 million program to develop a selfpowered permanent 
artificial heart 
unlike the current devices they would not require bulky external 
drive units and infectioninducing external lines they would be 
powered by transducer belts or vests and would allow the user to 
move around 
but such heart pumps are not expected to be ready for 
experimental use for at least a few years thats what prompted 
copeland to call for interim measures 
permanent implants would be a reasonable response to dealing with 
the growing number of endstage heart patients too sick or too old 
to qualify for transplants copeland says 
admittedly they wouldnt play tennis go swimming be too 
active theyd be tethered but theyd be alive the surgeon says 
copeland also says numerous questions such as whether infection 
necessarily develops inside a permanent artificial heart need 
answering before development of a newgeneration device 
copeland says the public views permanent artificial hearts as 
science fiction if another round of permanent implants began he 
says it would draw the kind of media attention focused on devries 
and the first modern artificial implant patients barney clark in 
december 1982 and william schroeder in november 1984 
as of midmay 106 of 146 artificial heart bridgetotransplant 
patients went on to receive transplants seventythree of them 
survived says gary cole executive vice president of salt lake 
citybased symbion inc an additional 35 patients did not survive to 
have subsequent surgery and the others were awaiting transplants 
in march 1985 copeland implanted an unauthorized device known as 
the phoenix heart in a patient who had rejected a transplant the 
man lived on the device for 11 hours before receiving a second donor 
heart but died about 36 hours later of complications unrelated to 
the device 
on aug 29 1985 copeland implanted the first jarvik7 to be 
used as a temporary bridge and nine days later patient michael 
drummond received a transplant drummond works in a grocery store 
today 
copeland says surgical teams have learned a great deal about 
heart bridging from their limited experience 
copelands team has a 34yearold patient who on feb 28 received 
a j770 intended as a bridge but no suitable donor heart was found 
until june 20 the man has been making a slow recovery 
a transplant optimally should be performed within three weeks 
after the artificial heart is implanted because of the rapid growth 
of scar tissue around it which must be cut through and bleeds 
profusely during transplantation copeland says 
he speculated that such adhesions probably would be good in the 
long term for a permanent implant because they bring blood around 
the artificial heart and police it from a microbiologic point of 
view 
each of devries permanent implant patients bled massively 
suffered the destruction of red blood cells that led to kidney 
failure or developed infections that led to endocarditis or 
inflammation of the hearts lining membrane copeland says 
but he says bernadette chayrez his patient who survived for 244 
days in 1986 on a second jarvik770 after her body rejected a 
tranplant following an initial jarvik implantation suffered neither 
endocarditis nor severe stroke 
she did sustain a localized stroke 218 days after the second 
implant and developed a chest infection a week later neither of 
which proved fatal copeland says in the autopsy the jarvik7 
showed no sign of infection he says 
there are ways to prevent infections and were going to try 
some of those ways im not sure that weve got the answers right 
here to hand out but i think that we need to try this he says 
i dont think theres any reason for not doing it 
jarvik says the question is whether more research energy and 
money should be invested in compressed airdriven hearts 
while there is good evidence that many people would live for 
years jarvik says the emphasis should be put on making something 
thats really practical available and i dont think that thats 
going to be accomplished with compressed airdriven hearts 
i do think dr copeland is terrific and hes done really 
excellent work and i understand his point but id like to see that 
energy and urgency that he suggests because of the lack of donors 
directed into electric artificial heart research jarvik adds i 
think it would do more good in the long run

paul leenheer took part in a 
violent antiamerican demonstration outside the us consulate in 
1982 raging at what he thought was us culpability in the shooting 
deaths of four dutch journalists covering a firefight in el salvador 
nowadays the 31yearold dutch lawyer is legal adviser to the 
netherlands branch of a large american company 
if anyone would have told me that back in 1982 i would have 
thrown him out of the house leenheer said prior to president 
bushs 24hour visit to the netherlands on monday 
leenheers radical aboutface mirrors the dutch publics often 
simultaneous adulation and condemnation of the united states this 
nations most important ally a major trading partner and its 
cultural idol 
either we tend to see the united states as the font of all 
evil or we think in patronizing terms of endearment in the sense 
of oh well those americans said johan lammers a 
professor of modern american history at leiden university 
were apparently unable to perceive of the unites states as 
just a nation albeit a powerful nation 
in three decades dutch public opinion has been drenched by just 
as many waves of antiamerican sentiment although lammers observed 
that those feelings have always been superficial throughout 
those public mood swings the various dutch governments have stayed 
a staunch friend and ally of the united states if not an advocate 
of all its foreign policy positions 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s dutch police fought pitched 
battles with students protesting us involvement in the vietnam 
war in 1968 several demonstrators were sentenced to twoweek jail 
terms for calling president johnson a murderer insulting the 
head of a friendly state was a criminal offense in the netherlands 
at the time 
later in the 1970s critics of the united states backed the 
influential peace movement here which spearheaded eight tumultuous 
years of opposition to deployment of usbuilt mediumrange 
nuclear missiles 
now the peace movement has all but withered away because of the 
1987 superpower pact banning all mediumrange missiles from europe 
the latest outbreak of antiamerican sentiment has focused on the 
widely held perception among the dutch intelligentsia that the us 
government is meddling in central american affairs especially the 
reagan administrations attempts to undermine nicaraguas sandinista 
government 
but lammers noted that the dutch government has not at any time 
been antiamerican on the contrary the netherlands has always been 
one of the united states most faithful allies 
the relations with the united states are the at the root of our 
security policy and those ties will not be severed said relus 
ter beek a prominent parliamentarian for the labor party which is 
primed for power after more than 10 years in opposition 
premier ruud lubbers centerright government resigned in may 
because of internal differences over how to finance an environmental 
cleanup and a centerleft coalition of lubbers christian 
democrats and labor is widely expected after elections scheduled for 
sept 6 
in the dispute over whether to deploy natos mediumrange cruise 
missiles on dutch soil labor led the parliamentary battle against 
deployment 
but ter beek said the cruise missile episode was a mere ripple 
in a good friendship such things hardly matter 
the usdutch friendship dates back more than two centuries 
when the dutch were among the first to establish diplomatic ties 
with the fledgling american republic and loaned money to it to fight 
the british 
the financial links are still strong with the netherlands the 
secondlargest investor in the united states 
and the cultural ties are described by historian lammers as the 
americanization of daily life here the public is bombarded with 
american movies television soap operas and fashions while 
television and radio commercials increasingly use heavily accented 
american english to get their messages across 
weve always reproached the americans for their superficiality 
their vulgarity the mcdonalds culture lammers said 
but it has been enthusiastically embraced by the younger 
generation which likes the jeans the chewing gum the relaxed life 
style as opposed to the rigidity of the old dutch class system he 
said 
but the lovehate attitude of the dutch intelligentsia is most 
acute in the field of us foreign policy 
im seething when american soldiers are flown to panama if that 
countrys leaders arent sufficiently servile and i think the 
usa should be thrown out of nato dutch columnist maaike helder 
recently wrote in the leftleaning amsterdam newspaper de volkskrant 
but no what would i be without the books of faulkner twain 
roth salinger bellow where would i be without billie holiday 
louis armstrong and prince he added 
american culture is more important to me than dutch culture

president bushs plan to combat cocaine at the 
south american source is all but dead just months after its 
inception according to officials who cite turf battles among us 
agencies poor planning and a lack of coordination 
the plan to eradicate and intercept cocaine in peru and bolivia 
the worlds main coca plant producers also suffered serious 
setbacks because the two andean nations are rife with corruption 
lack resources and face enormous economic and political problems 
the officials say in peru the largest coca leaf grower an 
ambitious us program has been halted because increasing guerrilla 
activity threatened american personnel 
south america was to be the battleground for stopping the cocaine 
flow into the united states bush in his presidential campaign 
called for an international strike force to hit back quick and 
hard and often at foreign drug operations to stop narcotics 
production at the source 
most of the worlds coca leaves the source of cocaine grow in 
perus upper huallaga valley a lush region at the foothills of the 
andes known as the cocaine cradle the sprawling region is a 
stronghold of leftist guerrillas known as sendero luminoso or 
shining path 
us efforts to operate in the region and set up bushs strike 
force were halted because of the security threat said a spokeswoman 
for the state departments bureau of international narcotics 
matters she spoke on condition she not be identified 
groundlevel eradication already inefficient because it is done 
by hand was slowed further aerial spraying which would 
effectively stop the plants four harvests a year is banned by 
bolivian law and repeatedly put off in peru 
attempts by about a dozen agents of the drug enforcement 
administration to locate and destroy makeshift cocaine laboratories 
and clandestine airstrips have been curtailed by the guerrilla 
activity forcing agents to move out of the region and ferry in by 
helicopter for daytrips 
with the strikeforce approach stalled dea agents are falling 
back on longstanding programs of advising local authorities they 
continue to train peruvian police while work goes on in the upper 
huallaga valley to shore up a helicopter base to offer enough 
security against the guerrillas for american personnel to operate 
fulltime in the region 
the work according to a state department official includes 
everything from lighting and wires to clearing the area outside 
the fence so you can see whos coming in 
at the same time dea agents will be undergoing a course tailored 
for them by the us army later this month at fort benning ga 
charles j gutensohn chief of cocaine investigations for the dea 
said in an interview that the training is primarily to teach the 
agents to deal with perus jungle environment and the maoist 
guerrillas operating there 
us officials still disagree on where prime responsibility for 
the south american drug mission should lie with options ranging 
from the dea whose primary role is law enforcement to the us 
armed forces which would go after the traffickers and growers using 
counterinsurgency tactics 
the cia noting the lack of definition set up a counter 
narcotics center in april to combine operational and analytical 
support to our countrys fight against international drug 
trafficking says spokesman bill devine he said the plan is to 
unite the intelligence community the federal bureau of 
investigation the defense intelligence agency the national 
security agency the customs service and the dea 
declining to elaborate on the mechanics of the cia center devine 
added the whole idea is to prevent overlap for everyone to read 
from the same book 
some officials say the cia center is yet another layer of 
bureaucracy and a senate aide who has traveled to the druggrowing 
region says the cia center could prove unworkable because the agency 
routinely refuses to cooperate with other agencies because it 
doesnt give up its sources doesnt want to see them in court 
bushs drug czar william bennett is to issue a report in 
september to define the strategies for overseas and at home a 
national security council report on who does what is under way 
bennett spokesman don hamilton said 
some countries have approached us and asked for military and 
economic assistance hamilton added declining to name the 
nations such requests are indeed under consideration 
an administration official who works closely with drug issues 
said peru expressed an interest in military training and upgrading 
its equipment mostly aged soviet weaponry but the official who 
refused to be further identified said direct us military 
involvement of the kind reportedly being considered by the national 
security council is effectively a dead issue because none of the 
cocaineproducing countries will invite american troops 
the idea of increased us involvement or sending soldiers to 
south america has generated strong opinions with opponents citing 
the possible loss of american lives and proponents arguing that a 
direct role increases the chance of success 
gutensohn the deas chief of cocaine investigations opposes a 
military role but endorses his agencys overseas involvement 
the tactics are paramilitary the mission is law enforcement 
when we get issued the badge you know it could happen he said 
referring to the chances of being killed as a dea agent upstairs 
there are 35 badges of dead agents hanging on the wall 
but arnold trebach president of the drug policy foundation a 
liberal think tank sees us involvement in south america as futile 
if we cant control marijuana growing in our own country what 
person would dare suggest we could control it in peru bolivia he 
asked

the government has decided that britains biggest 
brewers wont have to sell off 22000 pubs as had been recommended 
as a way of fostering competition in the nations mostly 
brewerowned taverns 
trade secretary lord young announced measures monday to encourage 
competition in the supply of beer and other drinks but they were 
not as drastic as those recommended this year by the monopolies and 
mergers commission 
britains brewers are allowed to own pubs and to require that 
their tenants only buy beer and other drinks from the owner 
industry critics have called on the government to force competition 
which would bring cheaper prices and wider choices for consumers 
lord young said brewers would be allowed to own more than 2000 
pubs each but that they would have to keep at least half of those 
above that limit as free houses which can sell beer of their 
choice 
the commission recommended in march that no brewer should be 
allowed to own more than 2000 pubs this would have meant that 
alliedlyons plc bass plc elders ixl grand metropolitan plc 
scottish and newcastle plc and whitbread plc would have had to sell 
off 22000 of their tied houses 
britain has 82000 pubs a majority of which are tied tied 
houses are either tenanted houses owned by brewers but rented to 
tenants or are managed houses which are owned and operated by the 
brewers 
young had said when the report was published that he was inclined 
to accept the commissions recommendations on thursday he met the 
brewers to discuss the report 
young speaking monday in the house of lords said his decision 
would add 11030 free houses to the existing 15000 
these proposals should enable a major freeing of the market 
without the compulsory divestment originally recommended by the 
mmc he said 
lawmaker bryan gould the opposition labor partys spokesman on 
trade matters condemned the measures as craven and complete 
capitulation of government to the big brewers 
the national consumers association said it was disappointed the 
trade secretary didnt break up the big brewers stranglehold over 
the supply of beer his compromise decision wont benefit 
drinkers it said 
the brewers society which represents britains brewing 
industry said it was studying the decision 
the tenants of the national brewers also are to be free to buy 
ciders wines and spirits as well soft drinks and low alcohol and 
nonalcoholic beer from any source young said 
young has said the commissions recommendation that tenants 
should be allowed to offer a guest beer should only apply to the 
national brewers 
the trade department said the new rules would be put in place 
following a 42day consultation period during which details of the 
regulations would be finalized 
young doesnt plan to meet with brewing industry leaders again 
the department said 
the brewers are to be given two years to implement the changes 
one year after that the director general of fair trading is to

economic and finance ministers from the 
12 common market nations have set a timetable for preparatory work 
on the first stage of european monetary union 
the officials also ruled out for the time being a realignment of 
currencies within the european monetary system as a way to address 
trade imbalances among the 12 nations 
according to french finance minister pierre beregovoy the 12 
ministers agreed monday that preparatory work for the first stage of 
common market monetary union should be completed by december 
that would give member states six months to make the necessary 
adjustments before the july 1 1990 deadline for the beginning of 
stage one of monetary union 
that phase as agreed to by common market heads of state and 
government in madrid last month will include the removal of 
exchange controls closer coordination of economic and monetary 
policies and the eventual adherence of all common market currencies 
to the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system 
currently italy france and spain still have exchange controls 
britain portugal and greece do not participate in the exchange 
rate mechanism which limits fluctuations of common market 
currencies against one another 
in a session restricted to ministers and one aide each the 
officials also discussed a quarterly report by the european economic 
communitys executive commission on members economies and agreed 
that inflation was the most prominent threat to those economies 
according to the report prices in the 12nation trade bloc rose 
54 percent in the 12 months leading up to april compared with a 
32 percent increase in the 12 months to april 1988 
the ministers however did not make any decisions on how to 
address the issue 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said after the 
meeting that a communitywide stance on inflation was not necessary 
the 12 nations are all pursuing very much the same policies to 
curb inflation so joint action is already being taken he said 
the policies center on a tighter money supply lawson added

xerox corp said its board had approved a 
leveraged employee stock ownership plan for salaried employees and 
the repurchase of roughly 11 percent of the companys common stock 
xerox said monday the employee stock ownership plan for 57000 
salaried employees would be financed in part by forfeited merit 
raises and the loss of company contributions to a 401k retirement 
plan 
the company said it will implement the plan by issuing 785 
million worth of new series b convertible preferred stock and using 
the proceeds to repurchase 11 million of its 103 million outstanding 
common shares 
the repurchase of common stock was to be accomplished through a 
tender offer details of which the company said it would reveal 
tuesday 
david t kearns said the repurchase and the esop plan would 
provide greater value for shareholders 
by giving our employees a major stake in the company through 
the esop we are creating value by more closely aligning employee 
objectives with shareholder objectives kearns said 
the initial esop funding will come from bank loans which will be 
repaid over 15 years using three sources xerox said 
the first source will be dividends on the preferred shares held 
by the esop the second will result from the elimination as of jan 
1 1990 of company contributions to a 401k plan for salaried 
employees the final segment will require use of a portion of the 
1990 merit increase budget for us employees 
company spokesman thomas c abbott said most of the money for 
repaying the loans will come from the preferred share dividends but 
he said he didnt have a detailed breakdown of how much each segment 
would contribute to repayment of the loans 
the plan affects the salaried employees of xerox business 
products and systems operations crumm and forster inc xerox 
credit corp and the headquarters staff of the corporation and 
xerox financial services 
the employees wont have to use any of their own money from their 
current salaries to finance the esop 
the company also said it was willing to negotiate an esop for its 
6000 hourly workers represented by the amalgamated clothing and 
textile workers union abbott said the union raised the issue of an 
esop during contract negotiations that were completed earlier this 
year 
the company also said it would negotiate an esop with other 
unions representing another several hundred hourly workers

cvn companies inc has agreed to be 
acquired by the smaller qvc network inc in a deal officials hope 
will make the companies more competitive against home shopping 
network inc in the video shopping industry 
the agreement valued at more than 400 million in cash and 
stock is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies as 
well as federal regulatory approval the companies said monday 
the combination of qvc and cvn will allow for more effective 
direct marketing efforts which will result in increased subscriber 
acceptance and satisfaction cvn chairman theodore deikel said in 
a statement the combination will also enhance the opportunities 
for longterm growth 
joseph m segal qvcs chairman said his company would still 
reach fewer homes with its cvn and qvc shopping programs than home 
shopping network does 
but he said qvc would be able to compete more effectively and 
reach a sales level comparable to hsns if the deal goes through 
because the company would be able to offer consumers more 
diversified shopping programs and merchandise choices 
telecommunications inc of englewood colo cvns largest 
shareholder made its own offer for cvn in november but withdrew the 
bid in january 
the video retailing industry generated an estimated 14 billion 
in revenue last year 
the merger agreement calls for qvc of west chester pa to 
purchase all cvn common stock for 19 a share in cash plus 
oneeighth of a share in qvc common stock 
cvn which operates the cable value network the fashion channel 
and americas shopping channel had about 183 million shares of 
stock outstanding making that cash portion of the deal worth about 
350 million 
the stock portion of the deal would add about 40 million to the 
price of the transaction at recent prices 
in national overthecounter trading cvn rose 75 cents a share 
to 1925 on monday while qvc fell 62 cents a share to 1725 
cvn also has warrants and options outstanding that would add 25 
million to the value of the deal the companies indicated 
qvc which operates the qvc cable network has arranged for a 
financing commitment of 435 million from the bank of new york it 
has also received a commitment from comcast corp to buy 30 million 
of convertible subordinated debentures 
qvc had net sales of 213 million in the year ended may 31 
substantially smaller than cvns 6378 million in the same period 
however qvc has an exclusive tv agreement to sell sears roebuck 
merchandise 
cvn reported serving some 233 million cable subscribers to 141 
million for qvc 
home shopping which operates two shop from home networks had 
7301 million in sales in its latest fiscal year ended aug 31 
1988 
the research firm paul kagan associates inc of carmel calif 
estimated that home shoppings two channels combine for 5579 
million fulltimeequivalent subscribers a figure adjusted to 
account for the fact that not all cable operators use the service 24 
hours a day 
on the same basis kagan estimates that cvn is second in the 
industry with 2104 million fulltimeequivalent subscribers and 
qvc third with 1095 million 
cvn said its board decided that the qvc offer would benefit 
shareholders more than cvns previously announced plan to issue a 
special 10 a share dividend if cvn shareholders approve the 
merger the dividend will be canceled 
after the merger qvc said it intends to continue both companies 
television shopping programs 
qvc said it does not intend to make any substantial changes in 
cvn operations before the end of the year to allow time for teams 
from both companies to evaluate ways to enhance productivity

mccaw cellular communications inc has 
lowered its bid for lin broadcasting corp by about 400 million 
citing a new york court decision that was unfavorable to lin 
the new offer announced monday reduces to about 536 billion 
from 585 billion the total value of mccaws bid for the 90 
percent of lin shares it does not own 
a spokesman for the new yorkbased lin broadcasting wehich has 
rejected the original bid as inadequate said we regard the mccaw 
move as a cynical tactical manuever 
we continue to be excited by the prospects for lin and will do 
everything possible to protect the shareholders from the threat of 
an abusive takeover the lin statement said 
in lateafternooon trading in the overthecounter market lin 
was down 325 a share at 112 while mccaw was unchanged at 3775 a 
share 
if successful mccaws takeover attempt would result in the 
largest cellular telephone market in the country the regional 
supersystem that mccaw has been seeking would be more than twice 
the market size of mccaws closest competitors 
mccaw said its new 110 per share offer will expire at midnight 
new york time on july 21 the offer could be extended beyond that 
date mccaw said all other terms and conditions of the offer remain 
the same it said 
the two companies held discussions over the weekend about the 
status of the previous 120 per share offer for all outstanding 
shares of lin common stock the discussions did not result in any 
agreement or understanding mccaw said 
to date only a nominal number of shares have been tendered in 
the offer mccaw said 
the new york court of appeals late last month denied lins claims 
to certain cellular interests of metromedia co in the new york city 
and philadelphia markets 
some analysts had estimated that if lin had won the case the 
addition of the cellular interests could have added 40 a share to 
lins stock price 
in its statement lin confirmed that it had met with mccaw 
officials last weekend at mccaws request but that the talks were 
inconclusive 
although nothing came of the discussions it was clear from our 
meeting that they valued lin at higher than 120 per share mccaw 
has now had a more than ample opportunity to express itself and we 
can focus on other opportunities lin said in its statement 
mccaw first announced its bid to acquire lin in early june

a wall street brokerage convicted in the first 
insider trading case involving an investment firm plans to ask a 
federal judge to throw out the verdict because of an illogical 
split by a jury 
marcus schloss amp co was convicted monday in us district court 
in manhattan of conspiracy and securities fraud but the jury 
acquitted the firm of other charges and entirely cleared its chief 
arbitrager 
the conviction was the first against a new york stock exchange 
member firm in the governments threeyear wall street insider 
trading crackdown none of the charges involved trading on the big 
board 
marcus schloss was convicted of conspiracy in stock transactions 
involving five companies in 1985 and 1986 and of securities fraud 
for trading in the stock of american brands inc in march 1986 using 
illegally obtained inside information 
the firm faces a total fine of 1 million sentencing was set for 
september on a date to be set later 
but after a sixweek trial and two weeks of deliberations the 
jury acquitted the firm of five other counts and acquitted d ronald 
yagoda its head of arbitrage trading on a total of nine counts 
marcus schloss issued a statement saying it planned to ask the 
district court to set aside the guilty verdict 
to convict the firm on two of the seven counts against it at 
the same time mr yagoda is acquitted is illogical in the 
extreme the statement read 
marcus schloss and yagoda were acquitted of securities fraud in 
connection with purchases of stock in allegheny international inc 
union carbide corp and avondale mills and of fraud in connection 
with tender offers for the stocks of union carbide and avondale 
mills 
yagoda also was acquitted of fraud stemming from purchases of 
american brands stock and of charges of perjury and obstruction of 
justice in connection with the securities and exchange commissions 
investigation of the case 
the conspiracy conviction against marcus schloss also included 
charges of illegal stock trades in american can corp 
assistant us attorney carl h loewenson jr declined to comment 
on the acquittals stating that the jury convicted an important 
stock trading firm of insider trading for the first time 
yagodas attorney stanley arkin said he was delighted by 
the acquittal i think the government never should have brought 
the case against him he said they had no credible evidence 
the trial was an outgrowth of the yuppie five insider trading 
case that began in 1986 in that case four young investment 
professionals and a client of one of them confessed to stealing 
secret information about takeovers and using it to profit in the 
stock market 
marcus schloss yagoda another small brokerage and two other 
individuals were indicted last november on the insidertrading 
related charges for alleged deals between july 1985 and march 1986 
the indictment accused the defendants of participating in an 
insider trading ring with the yuppie five and an unidentified trader 
at the nowdefunct firm of jailed inside trader ivan boesky the 
ring included a former marcus schloss securities analyst andrew 
solomon who pleaded guilty in 1986 to insider trading and 
cooperated with the government 
the defendants allegedly used nonpublic information to trade 
profitabily in the stocks of the companies 
us district judge charles s haight jr earlier this year 
separated the trials of the other defendants victor teicher his 
firm victor teicher amp co and ross s frankel a former head of 
arbitrage research at drexel burnham lambert inc they are scheduled 
for trial in january 1990 
yagoda also faces a separate civil trial in us district court 
in manhattan on charges involving the same four stocks he was 
accused of illegally trading marcus schloss last year agreed to pay

new technologies being developed to burn coal 
more cleanly could reduce pollutants from old power plants linked to 
acid rain by nearly onehalf the energy department said 
the department is in the early stages of a projected 5 billion 
program with private industry to develop those clean coal 
technologies 
the technologies are not expected to be ready for commercial use 
before the turn of the century 
the department said monday that a draft analysis of the 
environment effects of the new technologies concludes that they 
could reduce national emissions of sulfur dioxide from existing coal 
plants by as much as 45 percent by the year 2010 
nitrogen oxide emissions could be cut by as much as 33 percent 
over the same period it said 
both pollutants are precursors of the acids that form and fall as 
acid rain when smokestack gases are carried long distances by the 
wind 
the analysis said clean coal technologies could result in a 5 
percent to 12 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions when 
used to refurbish older conventional power stations carbon dioxide 
an inevitable combustion product from any carbonbased fuel is the 
major gas responsible for the predicted greenhouse effect 
trapping of heat in the atmosphere and warming of the earth 
while the air pollutants could be reduced the energy department 
study said the effects on solid waste were less clear it said the 
amount of solid waste generated could range from a 22 percent 
reduction to a 23 percent increase 
it did not explain the disparity in projected solid waste 
generation but said these wastes would be in a dry form that is 
more easily handled than the wet sludge generated by the scrubbers 
used to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestack gases of newer 
coalburning power plants 
the commercialization of clean coal technologies would have a 
substantial beneficial effect on air quality in the year 2010 
compared to the noaction alternative the study said

a mysterious 18milelong oil slick sighted 
near the exxon valdez and the discovery of huge slabs of steel 
hanging from the crippled tanker will delay its entry into san diego 
bay the coast guard said monday 
things have gotten complicated said coast guard cmdr jack 
scarborough 
in other developments tests showed no traces of drugs in the 
captain and crew of a uruguayan tanker that spilled more than 
300000 gallons of oil in the delaware river two weeks ago their 
lawyer said in philadelphia in providence ri officials 
downgraded their estimate of the amount of oil spilled when a tanker 
ran aground off newport 
a coast guard inspection monday revealed potential navigational 
problems from pieces of steel partially torn loose during the 
vessels voyage from alaska where the valdez was involved in the 
nations worst oil spill 
the steel pieces were hanging 20 feet to 30 feet below the ships 
bottom and could drag in harbor shallows scarborough said 
the valdez arrived off san diego late sunday but must be 
certified by the coast guard as environmentally safe before its 
allowed into san diego bay 
the ship which had been scheduled to enter the bay tuesday is 
to be repaired at national steel and shipbuilding co where the 
vessel was built in 1986 
we have a couple of things to do scarborough said we have 
to make sure shes not leaking and we have to get this excess 
baggage removed 
an aircraft spotted an oil slick near the valdez which is about 
30 miles off san diego but coast guard officials who boarded the 
vessel monday morning to inspect it found no signs of leakage from 
the tanker scarborough said 
one of the things were looking for is to make sure theres no 
oil coming from the valdez he said the oil slick was close 
enough to the ship where it could be the source 
the slick is a sheen 18 miles long and about a mile wide 
scarborough said it sounds like a huge amount of oil but it 
really isnt certainly its enough to worry about he said 
the california fish and game department also was trying to 
determine whether the valdez was the source of the slick coast 
guard officials said 
exxon shipping co spokeswoman carrie chassin speaking from 
thousand oaks calif said she was not sure when the valdez would 
be cleared to enter the harbor 
the valdez smashed into a reef in alaskas prince william sound 
on march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude hundreds 
of miles of coastline were stained and thousands of animals died in 
the spill and the cleanup is continuing 
in philadelphia attorney raymond letulle said monday the coast 
guard received the negative drug test results by phone last week 
the tests were performed june 25 the day after the tanker 
accidently dropped anchor causing it to run aground in the river 
letulle said 
in providence officials downgraded the amount of oil spilled 
when a greek tanker ran aground off newport to onefifth the 
original estimate of 16 million gallons 
less than 300000 gallons of no 2 heating oil spilled from the 
world prodigy when it struck a reef off benton point on june 23 
said gary ott a national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
official assigned to the coast guard in boston 
the exxon valdez towed by two tug boats and accompanied by a 
third tug and salavage ship left alaska on june 23 for the 
2500mile journey to san diego 
about 42 million gallons of crude oil that remained on board 
after the accident was transferred to other tankers 
before departing the ships crude oil tanks were washed to 
eliminate residual cargo the valdez however is carrying fuel oil 
which will be needed when the ship comes into san diego bay on its 
own power 
the repairs are expected to cost 25 million and take nine months

princetonnewport partners lp engaged in a series 
of securities trades in 1984 and 1985 to generate shortterm capital 
losses for tax purposes but the deals were legal the defunct 
firms chief partner says 
testifying in his own defense princetonnewport former managing 
partner james sutton regan also said he was unaware of a separate 
stock deal involving drexel burnham lambert inc that the government 
has included in the securities fraud and racketeering case 
i did not commit a crime i did not cheat on my taxes i did 
not engage in a conspiracy i am totally 100 percent innocent 
regan said monday under questioning from his attorney theodore 
wells 
the government was expected to crossexamine regan today 
regan one of six defendants in the case testified that 
princetonnewport engaged in a series of tax trades in 1984 and 
1985 to generate shortterm capital losses it could claim as tax 
deductions he said the trades were necessitated in part by changes 
in federal laws 
it was my belief that the transactions were entirely legal 100 
percent legal he said 
regan 47 speaking calmly and evenly as he explained various 
complex tax arrangements described deals in which princetonnewport 
sold blocks of securities to other investment firms temporarily to 
claim losses for tax purposes 
the government alleges the deals were engineered to create false 
longterm capital gains and shortterm capital losses for 
princetonnewport in violation of federal tax laws the indictment 
last year alleged millions of dollars in bogus tax losses 
but regan testified that he was aware of federal laws when he 
ordered the firm to conduct socalled day trades in 1984 in 
which it sold blocks of stock and bought them back the same day he 
said all the trades were recorded in the companys books 
he said the transactions were subject to market fluctuation and 
no prearranged buyback price had been set 
the government alleges the trades were parking arrangements 
in which securities owned by one party are sold to another with an 
agreement to repurchase usually at a preset time and price the 
government maintains that such deals are illegal if designed to 
skirt federal tax or disclosure laws 
he said he told princetonnewport general partner paul a berkman 
to conduct other trades in early 1985 through merrill lynch amp co 
and drexel burnham lambert inc 
some of those trades involved asking merrill and drexel to hold 
stock in various companies for at least 31 days before 
princetonnewport could repurchase it in accordance with federal 
laws he said 
this kind of tax planning was common all the time he said 
people would do anything possible to avoid longterm losses 
anything legally possible 
regan denied any involvement in a deal cited in the indictment 
that former drexel trader bruce lee newberg told princetonnewport 
to sell blocks of stock in comb co to try to manipulate its 
share price downward in 1985 
i had no knowledge of that transaction whatsoever he said 
in addition to regan berkman and newberg on trial are 
princetonnewport general partners charles zarzecki and jack z 
rabinowitz and the firms controller steven b smotrich 
princetonnewport a small securities firm with offices in 
princeton nj and newport beach calif went out of business 
after the indictment was brought last august

hes ranked as the richest man in the 
nation by a leading business magazine but to folks in bentonville 
a town of about 8700 people sam walton is just another neighbor 
hes just a part of the community said curt loyd executive 
director of the bentonville chamber of commerce hes a neat 
person he calls bentonville home and that is special to us 
walton who prefers birdhunting tennis and opening new walmart 
stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings is again 
shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the 
worlds top billionaires according to forbes magazines july 24 
edition the walton familys estimated worth is 87 billion up 
from its 1988 estimate of 65 billion 
he is unavailable said walmart spokesman don shinkle of the 
silverhaired founder of the nations thirdlargest retail chain 
based in bentonville about 150 miles northwest of little rock 
shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters monday 
morning when the forbes list appeared in newspapers shinkle said 
news coverage about walton usually sets off a press frenzy for 
comments from him but the 71yearold businessman declined to 
comment 
he feels any attention to sam walton is to the individual and 
he prefers attention to sam walton the founder of the company 
shinkle said 
he very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings it just 
puts him in a position he doesnt want to be 
but walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal 
modesty just after the 1987 stock market crash in which waltons 
familyowned chunk of walmart stock lost millions in value he 
quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another 
topic that it was only paper walton then changed the subject 
walton was first listed by forbes as the nations richest man in 
october 1985 three years ago forbes also began listing the worlds 
wealthiest people walton made that listing as the richest american 
every year since this year he ranks third behind two japanese 
businessmen 
shinkle said walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 
1400 stores operated by the company he started as a single 
fiveanddime at rogers more than two decades ago he is out of the 
office up to four days a week the spokesman said 
he spends most of his time talking to associates and 
customers shinkle said and he always comes back with many 
ideas from them 
walmart calls its sales help associates instead of employees 
when walton first made the forbes list of richest americans 
recalled little rock investment banker warren simpson calls came in 
from all over about the billionaire from the ozarks

the release friday of the us wholesale price index ikeda added 
expectations that the united states will make a further move to 
relax its monetary policy no longer are affecting the tokyo market

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is shying 
away from his threat to recommend that a savings and loan bill be 
vetoed if it includes a democratic plan adding 44 billion to the 
budget deficit 
at a packed news conference on the eve of todays negotiations on 
separate house and senate sampl bills brady reiterated his strong 
opposition to the democrats plan 
however he ducked attempts to prod him into repeating a veto 
threat he issued when congress first began debating president bushs 
proposal to fund sampl rescues and he said he has not yet discussed 
the possibility of a veto with bush 
i dont expect to get to that point when people concentrate on 
this that plan will wind up where the bush position has 
suggested that it be he said 
meanwhile brady said the treasury department has refined its 
proposal on the resolution trust corp the new agency that will 
close or rescue more than 500 failed sampls and dispose of an 
estimated 300 billion in bad loans and repossessed real estate 
a treasury department outline obtained by the associated press 
shows that the administration has agreed to broaden the power and 
authority of the federal deposit insurance corp 
fdic chairman l william seidman who has sought even more 
independence for his agency than treasury is proposing said the 
fdic was reviewing the treasury outline 
at this point were not expressing concern he said 
the treasury proposal makes it clear that the fdic will have 
daytoday authority over sampl rescue operations with the rtc 
playing only an oversight role to ensure that taxpayers money is 
not wasted 
however the treasury is declining to compromise with seidman on 
two key points it insists that the rtc employ an independent 
oversight and auditing staff of 50 to 100 people and it has 
resisted seidmans request for a seat on the rtc board 
the sampl bailout funding question has emerged as the biggest 
difference that house and senate negotiators must resolve over the 
next several weeks the senate in april adopted the administrations 
plan while the house last month approved the democratic version 
both plans evade the automatic budget cuts required by the 
grammrudman deficit law but democrats contend theirs is more 
honest because the deficit figure announced each year would include 
sampl spending 
the democrats plan would swell the deficit by 44 billion over 
three years but they say their method is cheaper for taxpayers 
because the money would be borrowed through treasury at a lower 
interest rate 
the administration plan keeps sampl spending out of the deficit by 
borrowing it through a special quasiprivate agency but at a higher 
interest rate 
the administration argues its method would preserve budget 
discipline because it is harder to duplicate for other spending 
programs thus it would keep interest rates lower throughout the 
economy it argues 
senate rules require either plan to pass by 60 votes and sen 
phil gramm rtexas has said he has been pledged 41 gop votes 
enough to block the democratic plan 
the house and senate versions also disagree on how to handle m 
danny wall the nations top sampl regulator walls agency the 
federal home loan bank board would be wrapped into the treasury 
department 
house banking committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
believes wall was responsible for hiding the true magnitude of the 
crisis from congress last year and wants to force wall to undergo 
another confirmation by the senate 
however the senate prodded by walls longtime boss sen jake 
garn rutah would permit wall to serve the two years left in his 
term

president bushs treasury secretary says the 
president will not offer any broad new initiatives to shore up 
international economic coordination at the economic summit this week 
in paris 
what we ought to take out of this summit is that the world 
economy is doing well and the economic policy coordination process 
is one that works said treasury secretary nicholas brady 
i dont think there needs to be too much added to the process 
at this point in time he said monday 
bush along with the leaders of britain france japan west 
germany italy and canada will attend the economic summit of the 
worlds largest industrial democracies from friday through sunday 
brady meeting with reporters before his own departure for the 
summit disputed contentions that the economic coordination process 
had stalled 
many economists are worried the surge in the value of the dollar 
that began in the spring will send americas trade deficit soaring 
again as us goods are priced out of overseas markets 
but brady said the dollar is now back where it stood when he last 
met with finance ministers from the other summit countries in april 
and the group expressed a desire to stabilize the us currencys 
value 
to those who contend the coordination process is not working 
brady pointed to the improvement in americas trade deficit which 
declined by 27 percent last year and has shown further improvement 
this year 
brady said the administration hopes to get a commitment from the 
other summit nations to support moves toward democracy in communist 
eastern europe 
bush on monday pledged in a speech to the polish parliament that 
the united states would provide 100 million in assistance to that 
country and would push for aid from other western nations at the 
paris summit 
the polish trade union solidarity has said 10 billion in aid was 
needed to rescue the polish economy but brady said that much 
assistance would not be forthcoming 
countries always ask for an amount of money that would solve 
their problems and the donor nations try to do the best they can 
he said

an attorney for depositors in a greek bank raided 
by federal authorities last month filed a lawsuit alleging the bank 
bilked immigrant greeks out of hundreds of millions of dollars 
the classaction lawsuit filed monday in us district court 
seeks 15 billion in damages and restitution for thousands of greek 
depositors in the national mortgage bank of greece 
attorney constantine kangles said the bank which advertised in 
greeklanguage newspapers in the united states promised customers 
interest rates as high as 18 percent that would be paid in greek 
drachmas and would not be disclosed to us authorities 
he said about 300 people are behind the lawsuit but their ranks 
could swell to as many as 3000 the 15 billion represents treble 
damages based on an estimate of about 500 million in deposits he 
said 
barry slotnick a new york attorney representing the bank did 
not comment on the lawsuit in a statement issued through a spokesman 
monday 
slotnick instead urged depositors in the bank not to panic he 
said in the statement all us representative offices of the bank 
were being staffed and american depositors would have access to 
their funds next week 
the civil lawsuit against the bank and 14 of its officers came 
less than a month after federal authorities raided seven bank 
branches in illinois massachusetts new york and pennsylvania 
seizing documents and arresting the officers 
the bank is charged with illegally accepting more than 700 
million in deposits from customers in the united states and sending 
the money overseas to avoid taxes according to a complaint filed in 
us district court in new york 
the national mortgage bank of greece is a separate entity from 
the national bank of greece which also operates in the united 
states the national bank of greece owns about 47 percent of the 
mortgage bank according to federal authorities 
the mortgage banks branches were not legally authorized to 
accept money from customers in the united states authorities say 
rather the us branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of 
encouraging investment in greece

after a trip back to the drawing board the 
securities and exchange commission is again proposing a change in 
rules that would make it easier for corporations to raise capital 
through the private sale of securities 
the commission voted unanimously 50 monday to seek another round 
of public comment on revisions to its controversial proposed rule 
144a which eliminates some restrictions on the resale of securities 
offered privately 
the secs proposed rule would create what it terms a safe 
harbor from registration and disclosure rules for the resale of 
privately offered securities to big institutional investors 
supporters of the proposed change said it would lower financing 
costs for companies and would attract foreign companies to raise 
capital in the united states 
but critics claimed the rule change would increase the power of 
large institutional investors such as banks and insurance 
companies while cutting into the business of stock exchanges 
privately sold or placed securities usually debt or equity 
securities such as corporate bonds are exempt from the secs public 
disclosure requirements 
corporations now may offer their securities in private placements 
to large investors without going through the timeconsuming 
disclosure and approval proceedings required for public offerings 
but investors who buy those disclosureexempt privately purchased 
securities must retain ownership for at least two years before they 
can be resold 
that requirement has made privately placed securities 
unattractive to many large investors 
rule 144a first proposed by the sec last october would have 
allowed the resale of such exempted or restricted securities 
providing the investors were large institutional investors with 
total assets of 100 million or more 
in response to some of the 89 letters commenting on the proposal 
as well as a roundtable discussion in march with top officials from 
major corporations and investment institutions the sec staff 
recommended changes in the original proposal 
those changes included shifting requirements on investor size 
from 100 million in total assets to 100 million in invested 
securities as a better indication of sophistication as an 
investor said linda quinn head of the secs division of 
corporation finance in a prepared statement to the five commission 
members 
one hundred million dollars in total assets is a small bank 
she said adding thats quite a small bank 
her division also recommended that the sec implement rule 144a 
in stages starting with sales to qualified institutional 
buyers with 100 million invested in securities 
also the division recommended that sellers of disclosureexempt 
privately placed securities provide the buyer upon request basic 
information concerning the issuer 
the division said it expected to return to the commission members 
with its final recommendation after more public comment early in 
the fall 
in other action the sec also proposed a rule change that would 
allow some canadian companies issuing securities to use canadian 
disclosure documents when registering in this country 
that proposal was developed in cooperation with the ontario 
securities commission and the commission des valeurs mobilieres du 
quebec 
of the 516 foreign issuers filing periodic reports with the sec 
more than half are canadian 
as of june 19 there were 21 canadian issuers listed on the new 
york stock exchange 38 on the american stock exchange and 146 
quoted on the national association of securities dealers automated 
quotations system according to the sec

the ongoing legal battle between 
donald trump and the pratt hotel corp over rights to develop the 
abandoned penthouse casino site is again focusing on whether the 
billionaire developer owns too much property here 
the latest chapter in the courtroom fight occurred monday before 
superior court judge l anthony gibson who heard arguments on 
whether his court or state gaming regulators should hear antitrust 
complaints filed against trump 
in 1988 the dallasbased pratt hotel corp announced plans to 
build the sands hollywood casino at the boardwalk site of the 
defunct penthouse casino project but when pratts development 
agreement expired in december trump stepped in and bought the site 
for a luxury noncasino hotel 
in april pratt sued trump in superior court asking the court to 
void trumps contract with penthouse publisher robert c guccione 
among the complaints trump guccione and their corporate entitities 
were charged with civil conspiracy antitrust fraud and engaging in 
a pattern of racketeering activity 
mondays hearing focused on whether four counts in pratts 
complaint against trump which charge him with violating the new 
jersey antitrust act should be heard by the court or the state 
casino control commission 
gibson extended the hearing until july 18 but in 1 hours he 
heard arguments from attorneys for trump pratt and penthouse 
penthouse attorney paul a rowe argued that the casino control 
commission in approving trumps recent purchase of elsinores 
atlantic casino hotel found that trump has not created a monopoly 
in atlantic city 
because the casino commission has already explored the subject of 
economic concentration gibson would only be duplicating efforts 
rowe said 
but pratt attorney arnold calmann said trump and penthouse are 
arguing to the court that the casino control act divests and 
eliminates the jurisdiction of a new jersey court to hear antitrust 
claims brought under the new jersey antitrust act there is no law 
to support that 
in 1978 penthouse bought the holiday inn on the boardwalk and 
the four seasons motel on pacific avenue and announced plans to link 
the two to create a casino hotel 
a steel superstructure was put in place to join the two 
buildings but construction stopped when guccione ran out of money 
trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework but 
refurbish the holiday inn site into a noncasino hotel connected to 
trump plaza the back section of the boardwalk property would become 
parking space for now he said but a luxury hotel would eventually 
be built on the site

a steady decline in interest rates should prompt 
most major banks to follow chase manhattan banks lead in lowering 
the prime rate again economists predicted 
chase stood alone monday in trimming its key lending rate a half 
percentage point to 105 percent 
im a little surprised that the other banks did not come in 
with a similar decision said robert a brusca chief financial 
economist for nikko securities co international i suspect some 
key people who probably make these decisions are probably on 
vacation 
but brusca predicted others would soon follow suit this week 
even as early as today 
the prime which usually lags behind other interest rates is the 
rate banks charge customers with the best credit ratings it also is 
the benchmark rate used to set interest on a variety of consumer and 
business credit including homeequity lines of credit 
it stood at 105 percent at the start of 1989 banks raised it 
twice in february to 115 percent then lowered a half percentage 
point on june 5 those movements reflected changing concerns about 
economic growth and inflation 
economists have been predicting another primerate drop as the 
federal reserve board shows more signs of loosening its credit 
policies in response to a slowdown in economic growth and easing of 
inflation 
last week the federal funds rates the market rate of which the 
fed has direct control dipped as low as 8 percent after hovering 
at around 9 percent the federal funds rate is what banks charge 
each other for overnight loans 
other credit market rates also have been falling steadily in 
recent weeks the treasurys bellwether 30year bond for instance 
has tumbled to about 8 percent its lowest level in more than two 
years and 30year fixed mortgage rates also have fallen dropping 
last week to an average 1017 percent a 14month low according to 
hsh associates a butler njbased mortgage reserach firm 
saving rates also have slipped with the average yield on the 
sixmonth certificate of deposit down to 879 percent last week from 
from 884 percent the previous week 
bond and stock prices rose moderatly following chases 
announcement monday while the dollar was little changed to slightly 
lower 
chase said it lowered its prime rate because its cost of 
borrowing money including interest it pays on savings accounts or 
cds had declined 
last week one small bank southwest bank in st louis cut its 
prime rate to 105 percent from 11 percent but since then no major 
bank but chase has taken similar action 
although its not unusual for one or two banks to adjust their 
prime rates without others immediately following major banks have 
essentially worked in harmony in recent years 
for example citibank and chase raised their prime to 775 
percent from 75 percent on march 31 1987 a day before other major 
banks started following suit 
the last time chase went solo was on dec 28 1983 when it 
lowered the prime to 11 percent from 115 percent other banks took 
similar action two weeks later 
we made an independent judgement chase spokesman fraser 
seitel said of mondays move what we base our decisions on as 
much as anything else is the level of the cost of funds and market 
rates and at this particular level 105 percent is clearly the 
appropriate rate 
while most economists predicted that interest rates would 
continue to decline through early next year some said the lower 
rates would do little to spur the economy other than give the 
sagging housing market a lift 
i see it as more of a way of preventing a recession than 
boosting economic growth said carol a stone a senior economist 
nomura securities inc weve just been on a threetofour year 
buying surge and i think a lot of peole are saying i have my vcr 
and my camcorder and other durable goods theres not a lot of pent 
up demand here

attorneys asked a delaware judge today to 
block time incs attempt to acquire warner communications inc and 
allow time shareholders to vote on a takeover bid by hostile suitor 
paramount communications inc 
in a hearing considered pivotal in the 5weekold battle for 
time attorneys for paramount maintained the media giant put itself 
up for sale when it agreed to a friendly merger with warner earlier 
this year and as such should be forced to consider paramounts 
hostile 122 billion bid 
paramount attorney melvyn l cantor told chancery court judge 
william t allen that times board knew in march when it agreed to 
merge with warner in a stock swap that the deal could put time on 
the auction block 
time subsequently changed the to a 14 billion tender offer for 
warners stock and the companies exchanged stock in each other to 
seal the deal 
cantor pointed to the exchange of stock as proof the companies 
knew they were opening themselves up to possible thirdparty bids 
michael r klein an attorney representing investor robert m 
bass and other major time shareholders made the same point 
klein said the stock exchange was done to defend the 
transactionit was understood that the market reaction might be to 
perceive that both time and warner were up for grabs 
both attorneys asked that time shareholders be allowed to vote on 
the 200 a share paramount offer time has proposed to complete the 
offer for warner without a shareholder vote 
times attorneys scheduled to present their case after a lunch 
break were expected to argue that its board never contemplated 
selling the company and that the agreement with warner stemmed from 
the ordinary conduct of times business 
nearly 200 people crowded into the chancery court for the hearing 
before judge william t allen absent were most top executives from 
the companies 
allens ruling which is not expected until later this week 
could affect more than just these three companies since many of the 
biggest us corporations are incorporated in delaware and subject 
to its laws and court rulings 
on the eve of the hearing time stock rose 112 to close at 
15262 a share monday on the new york stock exchange warner stock 
rose 25 cents to 62 a share and paramount dipped 25 cents to 5675 
a share 
time fell 262 a share to 150 in earlyafternoon trading 
today while warner lost 25 cents to 6175 and paramount rose 50 
cents to 5750 
also monday paramount said it had amended its 200pershare 
offer for time to add interest under certain conditions 
paramount said it would add interest at a rate of 9 percent a 
year if the deal were not completed within 60 days after time either 
agrees to the deal or is ordered to refrain from interfering with 
paramounts efforts to obtain government approval to transfer times 
cable television licenses 
our willingness to pay interest if the company cannot close its 
deal within 60 days underscores our confidence that regulatory 
approvals can be obtained within that period if times 
obstructionist tactics are stopped said donald oresman 
paramounts general counsel 
time offered no comment on the new terms but a source close to 
time speaking on condition he not be identified said paramounts 
interest offer represents a belated admission that it will take 
paramount a substantial period of time to obtain the necessary 
regulatory approvals 
time has rejected paramounts bid as inadequate and highly 
conditional saying it could take a year or more for paramount to 
secure the needed regulatory approvals for cable license transfers 
paramount has said it could win the necessary approvals within a 
few months but has complained that time has been drumming up 
opposition among local cable regulators to paramounts efforts 
the issue in todays court hearing according to duke university 
law school professor james d cox is whether entering into 
negotiations with warner triggers the auctioneer role for the 
time directors or can their conduct merely be judged by the 
business judgment rule 
the business judgment rule a widelyfollowed legal concept 
allows decisions made by directors in the normal course of business 
to stand courts generally are reluctant to disturb such decisions 
time chairman j richard munro hinted that the company was 
considering a merger when he told securities analysts last november 
that time intended to be among the growing ranks of global media 
conglomerates 
paramount chairman martin s davis has indicated he raised the 
possibility of a merger between paramount and time on several 
occasions during the past several years 
that raises the question of whether time entered into the merger 
agreement as a defensive step if that were the case time would be 
forced to consider buyout offers

stock prices soared tuesday following an unexpected 
21 billion takeover bid for the conglomerate bat industries plc 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index ended 557 
points or 25 percent higher at 22509 
earlier in the afternoon the closely watched index hit a 
postcrash high of 22608 at its lowest prior to the bid for bat 
the index was down 75 points at 21877 
volume totaled 6393 million shares up sharply from 4176 
million monday 
the bid by an investor group including anglofrench financier sir 
james goldsmith british financier jacob rothschild and australias 
kerry packer was quickly rejected by bat which said it was of 
dubious value 
nonetheless it inspired the market 
the bat bid was very important said kenneth inglis equity 
strategist at ubs phillips and drew were likely to see similar 
takeover attempts in the near future 
the markets leap forward prompted many equity analysts at london 
brokerages to forecast further robust gains in the market during the 
third quarter continuing takeover speculation high institutional 
liquidity and a lack of selling pressure are seen leading the 
market higher in the near term 
the market received additional upward impetus from a robust 
showing on wall street at the london close the dow jones 
industrial average was up 1764 points at 252030 points 
todays bid now suggests that no uk company is immune from a 
potential takeover one equity trader noted 
if successful a bat takeover would put british takeovers into 
the big league nearing last years 25 billion buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the largest company

latest sixto10day outlook which predicted normal rainfall and 
subnormal temperatures in the midwestern corn belt from sunday 
through thursday july 20 
the condition of the us corn and soybean crops deteriorated 
slightly in the past week due to lack of moisture according to the

stock prices moved higher today as the market 
extended its advance for a sixth straight session 
optimism about the outlook for further interest rate declines has 
set a positive tone on wall street while interest in buying stocks 
considered takeover candidates also has contributed to bullish 
sentiment 
hugh johnson chief investment officer at first albany corp 
said activity in the bond market appeared to have a direct impact on 
stocks today 
stock traders became enthusiastic about buying when the yield on 
the widely watched 30year treasury bond temporarily dropped below 8 
percent for the first time since the spring of 1987 
when the key bonds yield bounced back above 8 percent stock 
traders took it as a cue to sell and collect some profits said 
johnson 
probably the no1 feature today was the assault that the bond 
market made on the 8 percent yield he said it hit a lot more 
resistance or selling of bonds than most people expected which 
was a touch demoralizing for the bond market 
when it started to back off from that 8 percent wall the stock 
market saw that occur and started some measured profittaking 
johnson added 
meanwhile the market appeared to get a lift from wordof a 
surprise 21 billion bid for britains bat industries bat a big

frozen pork belly futures sank below 30 cents a pound tuesday on 
the chicago mercantile exchange amid renewed concern about the glut 
of bellies clogging the nations commercial freezers 
hog futures also retreated while cattle futures rose 
on other markets grains and soybeans were sharply lower energy 
futures advanced and precious metals were mixed 
frozen pork bellies settled 43 cent to 180 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery this month at 2897 cents a pound matching 
the nineyear low reached may 31 
the trading reflected expectations that a weekly exchange report 
would show no significant decline in the amount of pork bellies in 
cold storage outside of chicago 
the report issued after the close showed an unexpectedly large 
drawdown of 46 million pounds which analysts said could prompt 
some buying of futures on wednesday 
but frozen stocks of bellies which are cured and sliced to make 
bacon still are believed to be at nearrecord levels as the end of 
the heaviest usage period approaches 
charles levitt chief livestock market analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton inc said he expects the agriculture departments 
july 21 coldstorage report to show about 128 million pounds of 
frozen bellies on hand as of july 1 which would be the 
secondhighest total on record for that date and 1 times the 
10year average 
the july 1 record high was 1332 million pounds in 1964 
levitt said traders fear there will be little significant 
drawdown in frozen stocks by fall when hog slaughters typically 
increase and fresh bellies grow more abundant 
this is the time of year were supposed to be taking the chunk 
of bellies out of storage and using them in consumer channels 
levitt said 
if you get into the fall and start the seasonal increase in 
slaughters again what are you going to do if youve got a lot of 
bellies still left in storage theyll be worthless or near 
worthless 
hog futures prices fell in spillover selling from the belly pit 
while cattle futures advanced on expectations for dwindling supplies 
this fall

new england telephone is readying a new answering 
service it hopes will captivate the market rendering personal 
answering machines obsolete but one machine manufacturer says the 
industry wont suffer greatly 
the service which is being tested and introduced by the american 
telephone amp telegraph co spinoff throughout the country enables 
subscribers to use only their telephones to answer record and hold 
their calls with the telephone company storing all messages 
subscribers can leave recorded greetings on the central system 
and retrieve messages by punching into their touchtone phone a 
seven digit phone number followed by a personal code of between 
four and 10 digits 
because voice messaging can forward calls to be recorded if a 
subscribers line is busy company officials say they expect the new 
service will eliminate the need for answering machines which do not 
have that capability 
thats my wish answering services will never become obsolete 
because some customers need and desire the personal touch we cant 
provide but yes this could make machines completely obsolete 
anne kemerer a product manager for new england telephone said 
tuesday 
services employ personal operators to take calls who can then 
relay different messages to certain callers 
a leading manufacturer of answering machines said it was unlikely 
they would be edged out by a voice messaging service 
we feel people dont want their messages kept in a big computer 
downtown issues of privacy cost and complexity are viable enough 
so that its not going to be an overwhelming threat to the 
industry said jim oblak who is the director of marketing for 
phonemate inc 
yes it will take a certain amount of our business away but 
that will be small with nowhere near the ramifications of kicking 
us out of the business he said 
new england telephone estimates that onethird of its residential 
and business customers own answering machines 
kemerer also said that voice messaging was just the beginning of 
a host of expanded services planned by the company 
jim stork a telecommunications industry analyst for the chicago 
consulting firm duff amp phelps inc said the advent of digital 
networks had enabled ventures such as voice messaging and predicted 
an onslaught of new services from telephone companies 
voice mail is not subject to the strict rate regulation of 
regular telephone services and new england telephone can charge 
whatever subscribers will pay 
the service costs 6 per month for residential customers with a 
onetime activation charge of 1237 business subscribers will pay 
1843 up front and 12 a month thereafter

union pilots of northwest airlines will meet 
with alfred checchi on wednesday to review details of his groups 
proposed 4 billion takeover of the carriers parent a union 
spokesman said tuesday 
the pilots the only labor group at northwest without a contract 
are dismayed with the debt that would be imposed on the company 
under the proposed deal which is subject to shareholder and 
government approval 
financial advisers to the 5000member air line pilots 
association have said they favor a proposed recapitalization of the 
airline drafted by management as a backup to checchis 121ashare 
tender offer the backup plan would involve less borrowing and a 
lower payment to shareholders 
well give him a chance to raise our comfort level on this 
pilots union spokesman andy murphy said of the meeting to be held 
in new york 
meanwhile contract negotiations between the pilots and northwest 
resumed tuesday for the first time since nwa incs board of 
directors accepted checchis offer in midjune 
the mediated session began about 1 pm at nwas eagan 
headquarters the talks will be extended on a daybyday basis 
murphy said 
the two sides have been negotiating for more than two years over 
wages and benefits in the aftermath of nwas acquisition of republic 
airlines in the fall of 1986 the process is complicated by the need 
to bring pilots of the airlines under the same agreement

a new study of the performance of junk bonds in 
a recession released tuesday concludes that while some bonds would 
default high returns from the remainder would offset any losses 
it showed that the argument that the next recession will spell 
doom for highyield bond issuers and investors is a red herring 
said david wyss senior financial economist for drimcgrawhill a 
lexington mass business forecasting firm that conducted the study 
the study of 573 highyield bond issuing companies was 
commissioned by the alliance for capital access a junkbond trade 
association here it assumes a welldiversified portfolio of 
highyield securities held from 1988 to 1993 
junk bonds often used to finance corporate takeovers are 
riskier than investmentgrade corporate bonds but are designed to 
compensate investors for more frequent defaults by paying higher 
interest rates theyve become popular only since the start of the 
current economic expansion and critics say they would fare poorly in 
a recession 
the study used four negative economic scenarios including the 
socalled softlanding slower but continued growth currently 
being sought by the federal reserve as it attempts to contain 
inflation 
the other scenarios were small and big recessions and a deep 
recession accompanied by inflation such as occurred in 198182 
in each instance the study said highyield bonds would produce 
returns superior to those of mediumterm treasury bonds 
mortgagebacked securities and investmentgrade bonds even after 
defaults are taken into account 
the study found that the default rate for highyield bonds in 
each case would rise though not significantly 
what we also find is that the current yields of junk bonds are 
attractive enough to offset the risk of default wyss said at a 
news conference 
the study emphasized that investors should hold a widely mixed 
portfolio of junk bonds 
diversification remains the key it said the amount of any 
one issue should be watched since exposure to one company or one 
industry remains dangerous for junk bonds just as for commerical 
loans 
the study found the cumulative default rate over the five years 
would be 1316 percent in the softlanding scenario 1314 percent 
during a small recession 1334 percent during a large recession and 
1882 percent in the deep inflationary recession 
it said these default rates are similar to those found in other 
recent studies including one released earlier this year by the 
harvard business school 
at the same time the study said the total rate of return over 
the five years would be 7250 percent in the softlanding scenario 
7044 percent during a small recession 8032 during a big recession 
and 5445 in the deep inflationary recession

a substantial adverse impact on northwests financial structure 
but after skinner met with checchi two weeks ago a department 
spokesman said the secretary was keeping an open mind on the 
sale proposal 
the sale would raise nwas debt to 37 billion from 945 
million according to standard and poors corp the creditrating

a kraft attorney said the companys botched 
ready to roll promotional game was just an innocent mistake but 
a judge ruled tuesday that the estimated 20000 winners are entitled 
to seek relief in a classaction lawsuit 
many of the winners may have rushed out to buy kraft cheese after 
learning of the highly publicized mistake attorney robert johnson 
told circuit judge kenneth gillis 
those people should not be able to seek the same relief as those 
who played the game before the mistake was publicized johnson said 
the players intent in buying the product is irrelevant 
countered plaintiffs attorney burton weinstein who accused kraft 
usa of taking advantage of that great american obsession with 
gambling to sell cheese 
gillis granted a motion by weinstein and several other attorneys 
seeking to certify the winners as a class doing so allows all 
20000 and anyone else who comes forth with a winning game piece on 
or before oct 31 to seek the relief 
the contest involved matching leftside game pieces from 
specially marked packages of kraft cheese singles with rightside 
pieces available in newspaper inserts distributed in the chicago and 
houston metropolitan areas 
more than 10000 people claimed they had won what was intended to 
be the single grand prize a 17000 dodge van 
the suburban chicagobased company maintains that a printing 
error resulted in a total of about 21000 winners for four different 
prizes rather than the 8600 it anticipated for 8000 packages of 
cheese 500 skateboards 100 bicycles and at odds of 
15millionto1 a 1990 dodge caravan le 
kraft nullified the game june 12 after learning of the error and 
ordered the specially marked packages of cheese pulled from store 
shelves the company contended it was not legally liable for any of 
the prizes because of the errors 
on june 15 the company offered to quadruple the number of prizes 
originally offered and to add cash prizes and special drawings the 
proposal came after kraft entered into agreements of voluntary 
compliance with the attorneys general of illinois and texas 
under the new payout plan players who matched game pieces for 
the van and submitted them by a june 16 deadline would receive 250 
and be eligible for a drawing scheduled for friday in which four 
vans will be awarded 
but eight winners have already filed lawsuits and thousands more 
are expected to weinstein said 
the eight lawsuits have been consolidated and will become part of 
the classaction case to be filed within a sevenday time frame set 
by the judge he said

delta air lines decision to establish an employee 
stock ownership plan is being widely viewed as a deterrent to 
unwanted suitors at a time when takeover speculation has swept 
through the airline business 
nwa inc the minneapolis parent of northwest airlines recently 
was the subject of a takeover battle chicagobased ual corp the 
parent of united airlines has been the subject of recent media and 
wall street speculation that it might be targeted for acquisition 
and atlantas delta has been mentioned often in recent months as an 
attractive candidate for a takeover 
delta the nations third largest carrier generally does not 
comment on such speculation officials said the esop announced 
monday was not intended as a guard against a takeover 
we prefer to focus on the business aspect of the move as far 
as the esop it brings more in line the employee interest and the 
shareholder interest delta spokesman jim lundy said tuesday it 
gives the employees a much bigger stake in the company 
lundy said he was not aware of any other major airlines having 
esops but he noted employee stock ownership has become increasingly 
common throughout us industry 
deltas move which came the same day as an announcement of a 25 
millionshare stock sale to swissair was seen by some analysts as 
an attempt to erect a barrier to anyone considering a hostile 
takeover of the airline 
they noted that the esop combined with the swissair purchase 
would put 19 percent of the companys stock in friendly hands 
in trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange delta fell 50 
cents a share to 7125 
robert j joedicke an analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
in new york said deltas actions appeared to be wise 
i think its a prudent move with that possible takeovers in 
mind joedicke said a company nwa with similar 
characteristics just went through the same takeover situation 
you cant establish these things after you get a phone call 
saying were going to make a bid for you 
joedicke said esops are a sign of the times in an age of 
corporate raiders and debtfinanced buyouts of large corporations 
he said airlines are as likely as any to spark the interest of 
takeover artists airlines assets particularly their valuable 
fleets of jets make them especially attractive 
they takeovers tend to go through industries joedicke 
said food was great with beatrice and rjr nabisco when they 
finish running through that industry theyve got to look elsewhere 
for likely candidates 
paul p karos an airline industry analyst with first boston 
corp said esops have the added benefit of solidifying the loyalty 
of the workforce 
it has a motivating effect on the employees and it gives them 
incentive to do a good job karos said 
under the delta esop nearly 7 million shares of delta preferred 
stock were purchased for about 500 million the shares will be 
allocated to employees in lieu of existing cash contributions to the 
plan but they can be converted into common stock shares worth 
8640 each 
the preferred stock will pay 6 percent a year in dividends 
the swissair deal called for the sale of 25 million shares of 
delta common stock to the swiss carrier for 1933 million or about 
77 a share the agreement includes a reciprocal purchase by delta 
of up to 100000 or 5 percent of swissairs shares 
the two airlines agreed in march to develop joint operating and 
marketing agreements

prodemocracy protests that paralyzed beijing and 
other cities did not hurt the economy badly but longstanding 
problems such as inflation remained serious a government spokesman 
said tuesday 
yuan mu told a news conference retail prices rose 255 percent in 
the first six months of the year over the same period of 1988 
he said most of the increase actually took place at the end of 
last year when inflation peaked at about a 36 percent annual rate 
the highest in 40 years of communist rule and a factor in widespread 
public dissatisfaction with the government 
the momentum of inflation has been checked but in the 
second half of the year we will have to make great efforts to keep 
prices visibly lower than last year he said 
the government adopted harsh austerity measures last fall to curb 
inflation including a ban on new construction and halt to many 
projects already under way new taxes were introduced on chinas 
tiny but prosperous private sector and on luxury imports 
yuan said investment in fixed assets had been cut 7 percent from 
the first half of last year to 12 billion the pace of growth in 
retail sales has fallen he said and the money supply has been cut 
economists have blamed chinas inflation on a combination of too 
much investment especially in luxury hotels and office buildings 
too much consumer spending and easy credit 
the economic situation is still not rationalized yuan said 
problems he added remain quite serious 
official reports last week said processing industries continued 
to grow faster than raw material production creating shortages that 
also have contributed to price increases 
recent reports also put the trade deficit at 57 billion for the 
first half of the year however yuan said the actual deficit was 
38 billion taking donations into account and deducting from the 
import figure equipment brought into the country as foreign 
investment 
he said actual foreign investment was up 327 percent to 376 
billion while contracts were signed for an additional 17 billion 
in investment 
he said the figures showed that the impact of the seven weeks of 
protests in beijing and june 34 army crackdown were not very 
serious foreign disapproval expressed in the form of sanctions 
could hurt chinas economy in the short term he added but in the 
long run would only inspire a spirit of plain living and hard 
struggle and relying on our own efforts 
beijing city officials have put direct economic losses from the 
protests and fighting at 3475 million 
yuan said prospects for the summer harvest were good after four 
straight years of poor agricultural performance he said all summer 
crops were expected to yield 93 million tons up more than 2 tons 
from last year 
official media reports in the past two weeks have acclaimed the 
crop that is being harvested now as a bumper one due largely to 
good rainfall in regions hit by a serious drought last year 
but the harvest presents the state with a new dilemma how to pay 
for grain that the peasants are required to sell directly to the 
government last fall lacking cash the state gave many peasants 
ious but it has pledged not to do so this year

disrupted on tuesday in the most severe week of strikes for higher 
pay since prime minister margaret thatcher took office 10 years ago 
meanwhile a survey of public opinion polls by the british 
broadcasting corp showed mrs thatcher trailing in popularity for 
the first time 
late tuesday the first direct negotiations since may between 
staterun british rail and unions broke down when union 
representatives walked out after the two sides failed to agree on a 
pay raise

public mrs thatcher said 
the prime minister spoke hours after the bbcs poll of polls 
reported neil kinnocks labor party had a 10point lead over mrs 
thatchers governing conservative party 
commuters struggled to get home tuesday as hundreds of trains 
were canceled nationwide on the second day of a ban on overtime by 
the train workers union the associated society of locomotive 
engineers and firemen 
unions want a 10 percent pay raise but british rail has offered 
them 7 percent they say a major cause of this summers labor unrest 
is an annual inflation rate of 83 percent the highest in seven 
years which has eaten into wages 
rail workers also want british rail to continue its national pay 
bargaining which the company has said will be replaced on oct 31 
with regional negotiations 
the national union of railwaymen said it would go ahead with 
wednesdays 24hour strike the fourth in as many weeks subway 
train drivers were also to strike wednesday in the 10th stoppage 
since april 5th 
the transport and general workers union said 96 percent of its 
9400 dock workers stayed away on the first day of an indefinite 
strike for job guarantees at 60 ports nationwide but the national 
association of port employers said the dock workers were split with 
18 of the 60 ports operating normally
