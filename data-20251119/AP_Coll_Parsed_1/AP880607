withholding governmental benefits such as student loans and public 
housing assistance to people convicted of drug use according to a 
published report 
the cabinetlevel national drug policy board headed by attorney 
general edwin meese iii approved the proposals in outline form at a 
meeting may 27 but they have not yet been presented to president 
reagan the washington post reported in wednesdays editions citing 
sources it did not identify 
were not trying to be draconian were not going to kick poor 
people out of public housing the post quoted one source as 
saying but at the same time were trying to encourage state 
and local governments and colleges to adopt antidrug programs that 
will have maximum impact 
the proposals would seek to fight drug abuse by threatening to 
withhold some federal aid to state and local governments colleges 
and universities and other publicly funded institutions that fail to 
adopt strict federally approved antidrug programs the sources 
said 
one proposal calls for state governments to refuse to issue 
firsttime drivers licenses to minors who have been convicted of 
drug use and the federal government would enforce this by 
threatening to withhold federal transportation funding the post 
said 
various federal department and agencies were directed to study 
the proposals and report back to meese by wednesday the newspaper 
said one source told the post that no objections had been raised 
and that the proposals probably would be presented to reagan within 
the next few days

democrat jesse jackson staged what was to have 
been a celebratory appeal for votes on the final night of the 
california primary campaign but the halfhour show was botched when 
the presidential candidate got stuck in traffic and missed half of 
it 
jackson arrived 16 minutes into the halfhour broadcast which 
originated at los angeles station ktla and shown throughout the 
state at a cost of 150000 
jackson fell behind schedule on campaign appearances in san 
francisco earlier in the the day then got tied up in traffic jams 
trying to get to the san francisco airport 
the show opened with rock disc jockey casey kasem a jackson 
supporter announcing that the chair next to him was empty because 
jackson was on his way 
the first half of the show was given over to a video montage of 
jackson campaign appearances 
kasem filled time waiting for jackson by interviewing chris 
hammond jacksons state campaign manager producing some tortured 
exchanges 
then came a second video montage featuring some of the same 
footage already shown finally jackson appeared 
the candidate appearing calm but his face glistening with 
perspiration talked about the issues that he has stressed in 
california offshore oil drilling and environmental concerns as 
well as devoting defense funding to peaceful application in space 
and science instead 
he also highlighted his antidrug message and his call for an end 
to gang warfare 
jackson told kasem he had a day of big crowds lots of 
excitement but mostly of touching peoples hearts 
earlier in the day jackson shifting the focus toward thd 
democratic convention this summer said monday he will go to the 
convention mat with michael dukakis unless the democratic 
frontrunner comes around to his position on south africa 
jackson accused dukakis of proceeding too cautiously and 
conservatively in refusing to agree with jackson that south africa 
should be declared a terrorist nation 
if he will not bend on that matter well simply meet on the 
floor at atlanta jackson said during a callin radio news 
conference the tough talk was the most pointed language jackson has 
used in discussing his intentions for the convention 
the matter needs to be resolved in the committee or in platform 
hearings or on the convention floor he told reporters later 
he indicated he will put up a fight for his platform issues but 
will do so within the framework of party rules leaving unclear just 
how hard a bargain he will drive 
we can resolve our differences within the context of our party 
and not in the streets and thats growth he said at one point 
he also said that at the convention he would use the rules to 
have fair rules a reference to his contention that the popular 
vote is not fairly reflected in the delegate count and so 
delegateselection procedures should be changed 
as for south africa jackson contends the united states should 
subject that nation to the trade sanctions applied to other 
countries it has put on its terrorist list such as libya north 
korea and cuba 
by any definition of a terrorist state south africa 
qualifies he said 
jackson said the democratic convention will have a tremendous 
impact on the priorities that the ticket will have im convinced 
the ticket will take a strong position against apartheid and declare 
south africa to be a terrorist state 
as to dukakis he said either the governor will offer 
leadership on these basic issues or be wallowing in the wave of the 
convention taking him out to sea 
its not a question of integrity its a question of judgment 
and priorities and the governor like all of us will keep 
expanding and keep growing he said 
jackson indicated he will push for platform planks on cutting 
back military spending and on shifting spending to housing health 
care and other social services 
although polls have shown jackson consistently trailing dukakis 
in california jackson said the state can produce an upset 
tomorrow if voters listen to their convictions rather than reports 
of an inevitable dukakis win 
in a philosophical vein jackson said he believes his candidacy 
has helped america grow in racial tolerance its clear america 
has become more and more accustomed to jesse jackson as a possible 
next president its a matter of growth im the stimulus im 
the catalyst for that growth

police say they foiled the first attempt 
of colombias medellin cartel drug barons to use chile as a 
transit point to send cocaine to the united states or europe 
the seizure of 22 pounds of pure cocaine worth 12 million on 
the street was the biggest cocaine bust in chile in 14 years police 
maj jaime rieutord said monday 
two colombians oscar diaz torres 30 and alberto marquez 42 
were arrested with the narcotic on friday at a fashionable santiago 
hotel after arriving from colombia police said 
the arrests were not immediately announced because police were 
waiting for accomplices to pick up the drugs but the accomplices 
never showed rieutord said 
diaz torres and marquez admitted to belonging to the cartel named 
after the city where it is based and said they were told to use 
santiago as a transit point because this city was not normally used 
and thus security could be less severe the major said 
rieutord said cocaine traffickers had not used chile as a transit 
station for more than a decade

sonnette a rare french donkey who 
narrowly escaped a government death sentence four years ago is 
expecting its first offspring 
she looks like she swallowed a barrel she looks like she wants 
to have it any minute said sharon vanderlip who owns the donkey 
with her husband jack vanderlip 
the vanderlips both veterinarians at the university of 
california san diego said sonnette successfully mated with a 
3yearold of the same breed about a year ago and should deliver her 
first foal later this month 
sonnette is one of four donkeys the vanderlips imported to their 
northern san diego county farm from the poitou region of france in 
1984 and 1985 
in 1984 federal agriculture inspectors almost put sonnette a 
member of an endangered species to death because the donkey failed 
an equine blood test for communicable diseases 
a public outcry ensued over the plans to destroy the animal and 
officials changed their mind when the vanderlips and other experts 
showed the test given wasnt suitable for a specialized variety such 
as the poitou donkey 
a test designed for the rare donkey was then given to sonnette 
and it was released from quarantine after being certified as healthy 
and free of disease since then the vanderlips have imported three 
other rare poitou donkeys including the fathertobe tartarin 
the vanderlips hope to establish a herd to help the save the 
breed from extinction about 45 poitou donkeys remain in existence 
said mrs vanderlip who learned about the species while studying 
veterinary medicine in france several years ago 
sonnette has been separated from the other donkeys and will 
remain alone with the foal until the baby is weaned at 4 months to 6 
months of age tartarin also will be kept away from sonnette as well 
as the foal because male donkeys can become agitated around small 
creatures and may even kill them mrs vanderlip said

talk show host phil donahue and his wife 
marlo thomas have upset preservationists because the couple wants 
to demolish a unique contemporary home on their property 
although an ordinance provides a threemonth grace period for 
structures over 50 years old nothing is on the books to stop the 
demolition of those built during the past 50 years 
we want architecturally significant structures included in the 
ordinance as well said lucinda mcweeney chairwoman of a historic 
survey of 400 westport homes 
the concrete house built in 1963 is located on the shore at 
donahues property it was purchased for 68 million in march by 
the couple along with 7 acres and a guest house next to their 35 
million tudor home on 31 acres overlooking long island sound 
the couple bought the land adjoining their property to prevent 
construction of a subdivision 
the house is considered a landmark in modern architecture 
mcweeney said and should be preserved for that reason 
im sorry that these people whom i respect would suggest that 
my only interest is the view donahue said my main interest is 
the security of my family and all the children who visit my home

too many doctors hesitate to give good 
advice about disease prevention and promotion of good health 
perhaps because theyre preoccupied with hightech medicine us 
surgeon general c everett koop said 
we seem at times to be more interested in transplanting 
diseased hearts and lungs than we are in teaching people not to 
smoke in order to prevent heart and lung disease from occuring in 
the first place he said monday 
koop speaking to graduates of the kirksville college of 
osteopathic medicine said doctors are under greater pressure to 
slow down if not reverse the rising cost of health care sometimes 
by making judgments based on cost rather than on the basis of good 
medicine

rising ocean levels will flood cities 
and the climate will become hotter and more stormy unless 
governments curb gas emissions that make the earth an everwarming 
greenhouse a group of scientists said 
the problem here is 10 times or maybe 100 times more important 
and more difficult than the thinning ozone layer said bert bolin 
of the world meteorological organization 
the group monday issued a report calling for coordinated planning 
to prepare coastal defenses against floods stop deforestation 
reexamine energy policies cooperate to monitor and study 
emissions and to carry out the accord to halt the depletion of the 
ozone layer recently signed in montreal 
the report said weather changes will make deserts hotter and 
tropical storms more severe in the next few decades it said rising 
seas will threaten to flood coastal cities like new york and 
endanger entire countries like the netherlands and bangladesh 
bolin said the scientists could not establish how the weather 
changes would hit specific areas but it was clear that climatic 
problems will be part of peoples lives over the next century 
the study was a followup to a 1985 conference of the 
international council of scientific unions at villach austria 
which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun near 
the earths surface warming the atmosphere in a greenhouse 
effect 
we are entering a new phase we told the world what scientists 
believe will be the case now nations and politicians must start 
to think about the problems said bolin whose pioneering work on 
the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer earned him this years 
150000 tyler prize for environmental achievement from the 
university of southern california 
the report said the earths average temperature will rise by at 
least 054 to 144 degrees fahrenheit per decade in the tropics and 
in the polar regions the rise in temperature may reach as much as 9 
degrees the report said 
the rising temperatures will melt polar ice packs in summer 
raising the sea level by 8 to 60 inches over the next 50 years the 
report said 
at least 30 of the worlds largest cities definitely will be 
affected said jill jaeger of the beijer institute of the royal 
institute of the academy of sciences who wrote the report 
in the last 100 years the earths average temperature has risen 
ninetenths of a degree and sea level has risen by four to 48 
inches she said 
even if emissions of dangerous gases were stopped immediately 
temperatures and the sea level would continue to rise at that rate 
for another 100 years because of those gases already released in the 
atmosphere she said 
the report said that among the effects tropical storms will 
become more frequent and hit wider areas patterns of rainfall and 
thus farming will change fish migrations will shift evaporation 
will increase making water supplies scarcer in semiarid zones 
trees and animals may have difficulty reproducing and may be 
threatened with extinction 
jaeger said more powerful storms could cause severe flooding in 
bangladesh threating the lives or dislocation of 50 million people 
floods could overwhelm the nile basin where 10 million egyptians 
live 
roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea she said 
the united states alone will have to spend up to 100 billion to 
protect its eastern seaboard she said 
the changing climate also will have military implications as seas 
become icefree along the northern coasts of europe north america 
and siberia 
if these coastlines become navigable fundamental security 
readjustments will be required the report said 
the report listed the greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide 
methane chlorofluorocarbons nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone

the dean of the district of columbia law school 
has resigned two months after his selection and three months before 
classes are scheduled to begin according to a published report 
it was the most agonizing decision of my career frank n 
jones told the washington post for a story in tuesdays editions 
my wife and family decided they really didnt want to move its 
as simple as that 
jones resignation becomes effective june 15 he plans to return 
to a private law practice in boston where he lives with his wife 
who is also an attorney and two children 
the resignation is the most recent in a series of setbacks that 
have plagued the fledgling law school created amid controversy over 
whether the city should take over its predecessor the failing 
antioch school of law 
mayor marion barry and the board of directors of the university 
of the district of columbia which is to assume control of the 
school in two years have opposed the takeover 
board chairman frederick b abramson said jones resignation 
makes it difficult to continue the schools operations because 
jones was responsible for many of the startup activities 
the resignation also adds to the growing list of law school deans 
in washington and around the nation who have quit recently 
in may the law school deans at american university and 
georgetown university announced their resignations meanwhile 
george washington university law school named a new dean in april 
and new deans have assumed positions at the law schools of catholic 
and howard universities in the past two years the george mason 
university law school in suburban arlington va also named a new 
dean in the last two years 
the american bar association has reported that 86 of the nations 
174 abaapproved law schools hired new deans in the last three

crews filming scenes for a movie about 
batwielding principal joe clark have disrupted classes and 
graduation plans but some students said the film also has generated 
excitement 
they moved our classes so what it doesnt mean they are going 
to stop said francis sousa an eastside high junior who is an 
extra in the movie mostly the only reason you sit in class by now 
is to go over your review sheets books have already been 
collected 
several students and parents have complained that warner bros 
crews filming lean on me forced a change in graduation sites 
passaic county schools superintendent melindo persi said monday 
clark who gained national attention for a gettough approach to 
education that includes wielding bullhorns and baseball bats in 
hallways could not be reached for comment calls left with his 
secretary monday were not returned 
as the 97member film crew built sets sprayed graffiti over 
lockers and filmed a scene with actor robert guillaume students 
hanging out after school said they saw only a positive impact from 
the movie 
sophomore kathy lewis an extra waiting to be called said 
students in the movie have been given plenty of time to do their 
homework and tutors are available if needed she said she hopes to 
parlay her movie appearance into greater roles in the future 
i was excited because now there is a chance for us to be 
noticed she said 
some school officials however were worried there are too many 
distractions at a time of year when important exams are held 
my concern is just for the kids said donna brightman a 
school board member id like them to be able to take their exams 
without a lot of commotion going on 
persi sent the paterson board of education a letter asking how 
the filming of lean on me is affecting the school 
in particular he is asking about newspaper reports that physical 
education classes have been canceled to let the film crew use the 
gymnasium that hallways are being blocked with film equipment and 
that regular instruction rooms have been sacrificed for the movie 
producer norman twain who began filming wednesday said his 
crews presence will have few negative academic effects 
sure its a little more crowded in the hallways twain said 
this is the time of year when everybody starts shorttiming 
anyhow just come over here and see the exodus at noontime 
twain acknowledged causing a change in graduation plans and 
attributed it to the artistic preferences of director john avildsen 
avildsen had planned to film the ceremony but because of 
aesthetic concerns persuaded the school to move the location to 
baurele field from the original and larger site hinchcliffe stadium 
two weeks ago avildsen decided not to film the graduation at 
that point another school had reserved the stadium for june 24 
forcing eastside to change its graduation date to june 25

government was the lowest in 15 months in may and air carriers also 
recorded their best ontime performances according to the 
transportation department 
the department said monday that its consumer affairs office 
received 36 percent fewer complaints from airline passengers than 
during the same month in 1987 for the first time since february 
1987 the number of complaints dipped below the 2000 level at 1820 
in april the latest month for which there was ontime 
information available the 14 largest airlines had 826 percent of 
their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule compared with 
788 percent in march the department said 
the april figures were the best since the department began 
monitoring ontime performance last september and in part reflected 
good weather during the month officials said 
transportation secretary jim burnley issued a statement saying 
that the latest ontime and consumer statistics indicate that our 
attempt to instill greater accountability into the aviation system 
seems to have made a substantial difference 
america west had the best performance during april with a 908 
percent ontime arrival rate followed by southwest airlines at 903 
percent pacific southwest airlines reported a 911 percent ontime 
rate but that covered only the first eight days of the month before 
its operations were incorporated into usair as a result of last 
years merger 
eastern airlines which has been plagued by labor tensions had 
the worst ontime arrival rate among the 14 airlines with 755 
percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule pan 
american world airways reported a 765 percent ontime mark 
the airlines also misplaced fewer bags during april with 653 
baggage complaints for every 1000 passengers flown compared with 
748 reports the previous month and 1183 reports in january the 
april figures for mishandled bags were also the best since the 
consumer statistics began being compiled last september 
the number of passengers bumped from flights because of 
overbooking also declined there were 371 passenger for every 
10000 boardings involuntarily bumped during april compared with 
546 passengers during the first three months of the year the 
department said 
continental airlines and eastern airlines both owned by texas 
air corp had the highest complaint rate in may with 1143 
complaints for every 100000 passengers who flew on continental and 
1034 complaints from every 100000 people on eastern 
while the number of complaints involving continental was more 
than any other airline it represented a sharp improvement over a 
year ago when the department received more than 21 complaints per 
100000 travelers on continental northwest airlines which until 
recently had consistently been among the airlines with high 
complaint rates also showed continued improvement with only 322 
complaints for every 100000 passengers flown in may 
southwest airlines aloha airlines and air wisconsin had the best 
complaint record with less than 1 complaint for every 100000 
passengers flown delta air lines had the fewest complaints among 
the large carriers at 132 per 100000 passengers 
the best arrival rate was reported at salt lake city where 906 
percent of the flights arrived on time during april followed by 
867 percent at memphis and phoenix san francisco had the worst 
arrival record at 684 percent 
the department tabulates ontime information for the 27 largest 
airports based on passenger traffic volume 
the april ontime statistics are made public at the same time as 
the may consumer complaint statistics although the two sets of 
statistics cover different months

a new treatment is available for the estimated 
8 million americans who suffer each year from genital warts 
the food and drug administration announced monday that it has 
okd direct injection of genetically engineered alpha interferon 
into the warts 
the fda said a study of 192 patients showed they exhibited marked 
improvement after receiving interferon injections three times a week 
for up to three weeks 
of the 192 42 percent experienced complete clearing of all their 
treated warts 24 percent had a 75 percent to 99 percent reduction 
in the size of their treated warts and 18 percent had a 50 percent 
to 74 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts the fda 
said 
previously the most effective treatments were painful and 
potentially scarring removal by freezing or burning 
some types of genital warts can be treated with direct 
application of conventional antiinfective drugs but this treatment 
often is not effective 
alpha interferon was first approved in june 1986 as a treatment 
for hairy cell leukemia a rare form of leukemia 
although the presence of genital warts is more distressing than 
healththreatening some studies have suggested there could be a 
relationship in women between the warts and later development of 
cervical cancer 
adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials were mild 
flulike symptoms the drug is not recommended for use in pregnant 
women since animal studies have shown the treatment may cause 
abortions 
schering corp of kenilworth nj will market the alpha 
interferon treatment under the introna brand name

since president reagans wife has rarely attended such events a 
reporter called on her to answer a few questions 
with a giggle and a grin the first lady demurred saying i 
only rescue people 
the first ladys response drew a peal of laughter from reporters 
who realized she was referring to a hectic scene several days 
earlier when shed reached out to pluck a hapless reporter loose 
from the overeager clutches of the kgb 
in a number of ways mrs reagans first visit to the soviet 
union cast her in a defenders role 
although it seemed odd for a woman who rarely goes to church 
mrs reagan used several events during the visit to make subtle 
points about religious freedom 
during a visit to the kremlins assumption cathedral nowadays a 
museum the first lady questioned her guide and raisa gorbachev 
about its use for religious services and the celebration of the 
1000year anniversary of the founding of christendom in russia 
she got only curt responses from the soviet first lady but mrs 
reagan pursued the topic again several days later 
upon viewing an icon named the trinity during a tour of the 
famed tretyakov gallery she told mrs gorbachev shed arrived in 
the soviet union on trinity sunday again little response 
at another point the first lady was told that before shed come 
mrs gorbachev had spoken at length about the icons but failed to 
mention their relgious meaning 
i dont know how you can neglect the religious implications 
mrs reagan insisted i mean they are there when you see them 
the first ladys propaganda points on behalf of religious freedom 
were accompanied by a few propaganda points on her own behalf as 
well 
left smarting after her washington summit encounters with the 
wellspoken and photogenic mrs gorbachev mrs reagan at first 
appeared intent on showing how to play the polite and wellmannered 
guest 
so it seemed a peace pact of the magnitude of the treaty of 
westphalia had been reached 
the two women held hands european style as they toured the 
kremlin cathedral on the first day of the visit 
and afterwards mrs reagans spokeswoman elaine crispen relayed 
quotes from a private afternoon tea in which the two poohpoohed the 
silly idea that there was any rivalry between them 
but it didnt last 
by wednesday when they toured the tretyakov gallery their 
equally strong wills collided as they jockeyed for position in front 
of the cameras 
mrs gorbachev offered reporters a dialogue displaying her 
opinions of the priceless artwork going so far as to quote russian 
author feodor dostoevsky on their beauty and how they reflected the 
russian soul 
this time mrs reagan appeared ready for the assertive mrs 
gorbachev insisting she be granted equal time she then made her 
thanks known to everyone and chatted a bit with reporters about her 
experiences 
mrs gorbachev backed away allowing the first lady to have her 
say 
but if body language is a barometer judge the seating chart that 
evening when the two men sat next to each other in the front row 
of the bolshois royal box and their ladies sat on the outside as 
far apart from each other as they could be and contrary to normal 
practice at such events 
but at the reagans departure there were smiles and waves all 
around 
perhaps it is the last time the two women will meet and it really 
isnt necessary that they be friends 
given mrs reagans newfound ability as her spokeswoman says 
to roll with the punches its clear mrs gorbachev has 
discovered she must allow for the moment when a us first lady 
insists she be allowed her own dialogue 
and through their words and appearances each first lady has 
become adept at getting a message across not only at home but to 
their counterparts homeland as well

sen lowell weickers forecast of senate action 
on president reagans persian gulf policy is simple let me 
predict when the next great debate will occur when the next great 
tragedy occurs in the persian gulf 
the statement by the connecticut republican came monday afternoon 
as the senate again sidestepped the issue of whether to require 
reagan to invoke the war powers act and defend his policy under 
terms of the controversial 1973 law 
as sen jesse helms rnc said this is not the first time 
its not the second time its not even the third time its the 
umpteenth time the senate debated the issue since the may 17 
1987 attack by iraq on the uss stark killed 37 sailors 
the senate has been unable to decide the question once and for 
all because it is divided both on the war powers law and on the 
separate question of reagans persian gulf policy senators noted 
during mondays debate 
the war powers act was approved by congress over the veto of 
president nixon who argued it was an unconstitutional restriction 
on his power all succeeding presidents including reagan have 
agreed with that point of view 
the act requires a report from the white house within 48 hours 
after us military personnel are sent into areas of imminent 
hostilities and under some circumstances requires them to be 
withdrawn within 60 or 90 days unless congress says they can remain 
reagans policy involves reflagging 11 kuwaiti tankers and 
protecting them with us navy warships in the gulf scene of 
fighting in the 8yearold iraniraq war kuwait is an ally of iraq 
six weeks ago the us mantle of protection was extended to 
neutral ships that ask for help from the us warships 
mondays vote in the senate was a 5431 decision to keep a 
resolution invoking the war powers act off the top of the chambers 
agenda although democrats hold a 5446 advantage in the chamber 
the issue cuts across political lines 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva summed up one view 
of the dilemma monday on one hand he said the policy of 
escorting of convoying kuwaiti ships is not a good one but thats 
the policy were following on the other byrd said the war 
powers act is an unworkable law 
byrd and other senate leaders have introduced a bill to overhaul 
the act by eliminating the 60day withdrawal period 
sen claiborne pell dri disagreed that the war powers law is 
unwieldy and offered a different reason for senate inaction if we 
choose to make it work itll work but we dont have the gumption 
to make it work he said 
weicker agreed there seems to be the inability by congress to 
stand up to presidents he said 
sen mark hatfield rore said the senate is afraid to take a 
stand on reagans policy and our silence is our complicity 
if the policy appears to be a success we can issue statements 
praising it but if it appears to be out of hand we can issue 
criticisms he explained 
the war powers law was written in response to the vietnam war and 
reflected a desire by congress to take back some of the power ceded 
to the executive branch during americas longest war 
senators have noted that the constitution gives congress not the 
president the power to declare war but the vietnam conflict was 
fought without a declaration of war and the modern reality most 
often features murky us military deployments such as the persian 
gulf and reagans deployment of us marines to lebanon for a 
peacekeeping mission the latter ended shortly after 241 servicemen 
were killed by a terrorist truck bomb 
congress will probably never again declare war said sen 
paul simon dill referring to that reality 
the war powers law and reagans persian gulf policy are also 
involved in a related federal court fight 
last year 115 legislators frustrated at the congressional 
inability to act filed suit in federal court seeking an order 
requiring reagan to invoke the law that challenge was turned down 
but the legislators are appealing and say they will pursue their 
case to the supreme court 
helms thinks the law will eventually be struck down by the 
nations highest court once it hits the supreme court theyre 
going to throw it out like a tub of lard because it is 
unconstitutional he said

balloonist per lindstrand soared more than 
10 miles to set an unofficial altitude record but had to crawl 
outside his pressurized gondola at 22000 feet and wield a pocket 
knife to release stubborn sandbags 
lindstrand on monday reached 59700 feet easily surpassing the 
55137foot record set in 1980 but fell short of his goal of 60000 
feet in his butane and solarpowered stratoquest hotair 
balloon project coordinator peter mason said 
the 12storyhigh craft took off into a clear sky but was 
hampered by two 200pound sandbags that failed to release 
automatically 
there was no way i could make the altitude record while 
carrying this sand said the 39yearold lindstrand so i had 
to climb out of the capsule and cut them 
the first bag was no problem because it was near the hatch but 
the second was on the other side of the craft beyond the reach of 
his oxygen line 
i had to take a deep breath run around cut it off and run 
back again all the while clinging on to the outside of the 
capsule he said that got a bit hairy 
there were a few white knuckles when i was climbing around 
there he said 
linstrand figures the sandbag problem cost him about 5000 feet 
in potential altitude 
it was a fairly average day i think lindstrand said 
jokingly we had a particular problem with the sandbags but 
nothing my trusty swiss army knife couldnt handle 
last year lindstrand and british millionaire richard brandson 
set another record when they became the first ever to cross the 
atlantic in a hot air balloon the two hold balloon records for 
speed 100 mph duration 31 hours and 41 minutes and distance 
3075 miles from that flight

concern over the hazards of chemical pesticides 
has gone too far according to members of a farm womens 
organization meeting in the nations capital 
we feed our families with the food we grow were not going to 
feed them poison says mildred brown of hale center texas 
she is here for the sixth annual washington meeting of women 
involved in farm economics an organization that brings together 
farm women from across the country to wrestle with agricultural 
issues 
the group frequently has focused on the intricacies of world 
markets for farm commodities and federal payment programs but 
pressure for congressional action on the pesticide issue prompted an 
environmental seminar as well this year 
many crops produced in the united states and overseas are sprayed 
with pesticides some of which the us environmental protection 
agency has linked with cancer and other serious health problems 
the two speakers at the farm womens session were representatives 
of industries that have been major targets of environmental 
criticism 
jack early president of the national agricultural chemical 
association focused on pesticides while vickie sullivan a 
legislative analyst with a utility company discussed the acid rain 
issue 
early said he doubted that regulatory legislation recently 
produced by the senate agriculture committee would be sent to the 
presidents desk this year 
he said so many loose ends remain to be tied up in other 
committees that it will be close to impossible to get all these 
things pulled together 
to do all that before congress goes home and tries to get 
reelected and they will do that earlier this year i just dont 
think you can get it all done this year he said 
his organization is supporting the agriculture committees bill 
but is opposing separate legislation cosponsored by agriculture 
committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt and sen david 
durenberger rminn 
it would impose stringent standards for clean groundwater which 
provides the major supply of drinking water for millions of 
americans but has in some areas been found to be laced with 
pesticides 
there may be an effort to attach the leahydurenberger plan to 
the agriculture committees blueprint for revising the federal 
insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 
after the session a number of members of the farm womens group 
agreed to discuss their attitudes toward pesticides at an impromptu 
roundtable discussion 
alice parker the groups president recalled how she drove into 
a farmers market near her home town of royal city wash not long 
ago with a truckload of vegetables nearby another farmer was 
parked advertising that his vegetables were organically grown 
without the use of pesticides 
customers were interested at first she says but that changed 
he had on his truck organicially grown and as soon as they 
found the worms on his vegetables they walked away she recalled 
they want absolutely perfect products and we have supplied them 
with them said naioma benson of sterling colo a wheat and 
cattle producer 
environmentalists she said are not looking at the total full 
picture and often have a biased and slanted view the notion 
that farmers are poisoning the land with toxic chemicals is absurd 
she said 
our families depend on it our futures and our childrens 
futures depend on it 
my husband really respects the chemicals and is very careful 
how he uses them said merlina tate of almira wash she also 
recalled a trip to the soviet union last year to inspect irrigation 
systems used in that country she saw beautiful vegetables grown 
there without benefit of pesticides 
but those same vegetables would not be bought in a us 
store she said the reason too many flaws caused by pests 
the women condemned the notion that us law should attempt to 
eliminate all risk from the use of pesticides 
instead they said pesticide use should be likened to the use of 
certain drugs that are beneficial in treating illnesses but 
sometimes have side effects or to automobiles which are certain to 
mean highway fatalities but provide vital transportation 
they also pointed the finger at pesticides banned here that are 
being used overseas on crops that are then brought into this country 
theyre being used in mexico and hauled across the border 
said clara jo spivey a louisville ala cotton and peanut grower

a farm belt senator clashed with administration 
officials after they rejected both his bill to increase the nations 
commitment to agricultural research and similar recommendations from 
an agriculture department task force 
youre rejecting the recommendations of your own task force 
sen kent conrad dnd said monday after usda voiced opposition 
to the proposals 
the bill would set up an independent corporation to make research 
grants and provide federal funding for it the price tag envisioned 
by conrad would be 100 million the task force recommended 1 
billion 
robert w long usda deputy assistant secretary for science and 
education made clear that the department was opposed 
we do disagree with the amount that was involved and we do 
disagree with the mechanisms that were involved and thats our 
privilege as it was their privilege to make those recommendations 
long said 
usda already supports a sizeable governmentoperated 
agricultural research program and long said conrads legislation 
would add a new layer of bureaucracy he also said the 
administration would not back research grants that could not be 
reviewed by the secretary of agriculture

michael dukakis closed to within 200 delegates 
of locking up the democratic presidential nomination even before the 
first votes were counted in todays seasonending primaries boosted 
by a surge of about 180 in the last week 
dukakis picked up 75 of those new delegates on monday alone some 
prodded into declaring their support by his campaign staff and 
others attracted by the neargravitational force that surrounds a 
winner 
hes been on a roll said susan brophy deputy director of 
delegate selection for the dukakis campaign 
hes shown election success week after week after week she 
said it casts a very favorable light on mike dukakis 
much of the surge came courtesy of super delegates the party 
leaders and elected officials who have heavily favored dukakis to 
the chagrin of jesse jackson 
the massachusetts governor also has been converting delegates who 
had been pledged to the suspended candidacies of sens albert gore 
jr and paul simon 
on monday kentucky gov wallace wilkinson a staunch supporter 
of gore switched to dukakis and brought the bulk of his states 
65member delegation with him this came two days after wilkinson 
said he would continue to support gore 
and in arizona on monday gov rose mofford and four other 
super delegates moved to dukakis from the uncommitted ranks 
where they had been since former gov bruce babbitt dropped out of 
the presidential race 
by its own estimates the dukakis campaign has moved within 
striking distance of the 2081 delegates needed to clinch the 
nomination with fewer than 200 delegates to go the campaign 
expects to take at least 280 of the 466 delegates at stake in 
todays primaries in california new jersey new mexico and montana 
the intensity of the operation to contact and win delegates has 
picked up as the primary season draws to a close delegates are told 
that the governor would appreciate it very much if they would get 
into the count earlier rather than later ms brophy said 
the goal of all of this is to take the pressure off dukakis 
after june 7 so he can go about the process of building a coalition 
for the general election she said 
another incentive is the memory of 1984 when walter mondale 
finished the final round of primaries without enough delegates to 
lock up the nomination and spent an extra day pleading with a 
handful of delegates to put him over the top 
some members of dukakis staff including delegate chief tad 
devine worked for mondale four years ago 
of the 178 delegates moved into the dukakis column in the last 
week roughly half were super delegates the party leaders and 
politicians who automatically hold seats at the convention and the 
rest were delegates picked through the primaries and caucuses who 
had been uncommitted or pledged to other candidates 
i think that the advantage that we have is that we have been on 
the phones with these people so long and there is a real strong bond 
between some of these people and the campaign ms brophy said 
by monday dukakis held support from more than 321 of the 643 
super delegates while jackson was backed by just 54 of whom 42 are 
black according to the associated press delegate count 
jackson has complained that the super delegates have 
disproportionately favored dukakis and hinted he may challenge the 
rules that created them he also has indicated he may launch a 
convention challenge against the rules that allow some states to 
pick other delegates in a manner that does not reflect the results 
of the states primaries

will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun 
the youngest kennedy child daughter rory had not yet been born

it a point to speak with each of the children about their week

two dozen contestants tried their charms on carmen 
but a 4yearold boy was the only one able to spark the interest of 
the 5footlong boa constrictor 
i can make a sound like a snake cole anglin said as he 
looked into the serpents eyes i can listen ssssssssssssss 
carmen slithered with interest cole backed away 
the boy was declared the winner of the dallas zoos 
snakecharming contest because he was the only one able to coax 
carmen into moving he won a certificate worth 40 at a restaurant 
others tried to tempt the snake from her wooden perch sunday but 
carmen turned them down cold 
gordhan patel a 51yearold hospital worker who successfully 
sweettalked carmen last year wasnt able to repeat the feat 
perhaps it was because patel used the same line you like 
pizza spaghetti oh you like the birds chicken 
nicky waters 11 tried to make carmen flinch look out 
theres a truck nicky said when that didnt work he tried 
how about a fat juicy rat 
each competitor was allowed one minute to stand before carmen 
and try to coax it into motion three judges gauged audience and 
serpent reaction 
the contest was part of the zoos snakes of the metroplex 
weekend an exhibit of snakes indigenous to the region boa 
constrictors like carmen however in the wild live in central and 
south america

slapped with a bad reputation since adam and eve said zoo

michael dukakis converted dozens of delegates to his cause on 
monday and said he was looking forward to clinching the democratic 
presidential nomination in tuesdays final round of primaries jesse 
jackson bought half an hour of television time to make a live 
primaryeve appeal for votes in california but got caught in 
traffic and missed half of the show 
vice president george bush who wrapped up the republican 
nomination weeks ago said in california that he expects to find 
himself differing increasingly with administration policy as the 
campaign goes on 
well probably be dragged into more and more of these things 
rather than less he said at a news conference where he was asked 
about one such difference his advocacy of a delay in an offshore 
oil lease 
the oillease issue became moot monday night however when 
interior secretary donald hodel abruptly suspended plans to proceed 
with a controversial drilling project off northern california 
hodels primaryeve move followed bushs call for a delay in the 
project both dukakis and jackson oppose the offshore drilling and 
the issue has been an important one in environmentally sensitive 
california 
jackson meanwhile spent a busy last day of campaigning before 
the election so busy that he got tied up in traffic and arrived 16 
minutes late for a halfhour live broadcast that was supposed to be 
a dramatic final appeal for votes the television time for the show 
broadcast throughout the state cost 150000 
rock disc jockey casey kasem a jackson supporter filled the 
time while waiting for jackson with an interview with a jackson 
campaign official and video montages 
jackson said after the show he planned a meeting with dukakis 
late monday night at jacksons hotel 
dukakis aides have confidently predicted for weeks their man 
would amass the 2081 delegates needed for the nomination by the 
time the primaries ended and with one day remaining until then 
they were leaving nothing to chance 
the massachusetts governor picked up more than 70 delegates 
during the day increasing his total to 1874 that left less than 
200 short of the total needed and aides said he would pick up that 
many and more from the 466 at stake in primaries in california new 
jersey montana and new mexico 
dukakis was also preparing to pick up endorsements on wednesday 
from former rivals rep richard gephardt and sen paul simon 
campaign sources said dukakis was to stop off in gephardts home 
state of missouri to formally receive the congressmans backing and 
simon was to make an endorsement statement in washington without 
dukakis present the sources said 
this has been a great 15 months im excited about what 
happened and im looking forward if all goes well to a decisive 
victory so we can lock up the nomination dukakis said as he 
campaigned in california 
an abc news tracking poll released monday night suggested dukakis 
had a 21 lead over jackson in california the survey indicated he 
had the of 61 percent of those surveyed to 30 percent for jackson 
the figures from sampling of 415 voters done over the weekend 
represented a slight gain for dukakis the polls margin of error 
was 6 percentage points 
more than 40 of dukakis fresh delegates came from kentucky 
where gov wallace wilkinson led the way wilkinson and many other 
delegates there had been supporting dropout candidate albert gore 
jr 
jackson still spoke of chances for a california upset as he made 
the final rounds of his campaign and arranged a 30minute paid 
televised appeal in several of the states large cities but his 
talked turned increasingly to the preconvention bargaining that 
lies ahead 
he said he would push dukakis to stop moving cautiously and 
conservatively and to use the party platoform to take a stronger 
stand against south africa if he will not bend on that matter 
well simply meet each other on the floor at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta he said 
jackson who finished first or second in dozens of primaries and 
caucuses said he wanted changes in party rules as well 
particularly those dealing with selection of delegates in future 
campaigns 
in all he said however jackson also was careful to add we 
can resolve our differences within the contest of our party and not 
in the streets and thats growth 
he said i intend to keep building our party keep expanding 
participation keep registering voters keep encouraging people to 
be involved 
dukakis sounded anything but upset at jacksons talk 
i know how strongly he feels about the importance of a democrat 
in the white house next january he said 
of jacksons position on south africa the governor said i 
dont think its going to be a problemim for tougher sanctions 
i hope its going to be in our platform and i dont see where this 
is going to be a division in our party or our country 
dukakis the democratic frontrunner also jabbed at bush on the 
subject of offshore oil drilling the vice president staking out a 
difference with reagan administration policy said on sunday he 
favors a delay in a controversal drilling project off the coast of 
northern california 
said dukakis im pleased hes coming around but its kind of 
late im not for delaying that sale im for canceling it 
bush told a republican audience in california on monday night 
that he has major differences with dukakis on a range of issues 
he criticized the massachusetts governor for failing to support 
the death penalty for bigtime drug traffickers over a 
prisonerfurlough program in massachusetts and on arms control 
matters 
pointing to the recent ussoviet inf treaty the vice president 
said if wed listened to dukakis and jackson we wouldnt have 
made any progress at all

one hundred years ago the appalachian 
mountain club took 770 in donations and built a wood and stone 
cabin just above the timberline in the shadow of mount washington 
madison spring hut an oasis for hikers 4800 feet above sea 
level between mount madison and mount adams was the first of a 
series of rustic cabins that have been a model for wilderness 
shelters as far away as alaska 
over the weekend former workers and patrons held a reunion at 
that hut 
madison started out providing solid meals a bed and wool blanket 
and first aid to hikers in the presidential range which includes 
washington and is known for some of the harshest weather in the 
world 
as madison enters its 100th season the mission and the weather 
havent changed mondays forecast called for possible snow 
flurries and wind up to 90 mph but now there are eight huts 
throughout the white mountains accommodating the thousands of hikers 
who flood in from boston and other nearby urban areas 
madisons fourstory bunk beds which fill two small woodpaneled 
bedrooms are booked months in advance by backpackers the central 
dining room with a picture window facing mount madison seats 60 
for the weekend gathering opening the huts centennial season of 
providing hospitality in high places the amc invited hut 
caretakers from as far back as the early 1920s to a nostalgic party 
at the base of the mountains and a hike back to madison 
for some it was a pilgrimage 
thomas deans a former amc executive director wistfully recalled 
the wind in my face the aches in the shoulder when you take off a 
pack a good ache the smell of oil and of boot grease 
such sentiments were shared by most for whom the opportunity to 
work in the wilderness more than compensated for low salaries and 
long hours 
back then we made 4 a week said robert monahan 80 who 
worked at pinkham notch camp at the base of mount washington in 1924 
the next summer monahan moved to another hut where his duties 
included carrying 100pound packs of food and supplies four miles 
from a base camp several times a week 
today though helicopters drop tons of supplies into huts twice 
each season packing still is the main source of fresh food pack 
weights and sizes are the stuff of amc hut legends and they seemed 
to grow as the weekend went on 
i carried 165 pounds said cary hill a 1983 madison hutman 
there was a party and we needed a couple roasts and a watermelon 
on sunday morning former hutmen and hutwomen converged on the 
37mile valley way trail which leads straight up to madison 
i think its been lengthened said robert ohler 72 of the 
steep hike which he knew well from working at madison in the 
summers from 1936 to 1939 
ohler recalled stealing chairs from other huts cleaning mouse 
droppings from between the plates heating the hut with bacon grease 
and eating porcupine livers 
the nose of a porcupine got 20 cents from the town clerk 
thats where we got our beer money he said 
ohler also remembered the death of a teenager from hypothermia 
during an august storm in which temperatures hit the low 30s ohler 
had the job of tying the boy to a packboard and carrying him down 
the mountain on his back 
more than 100 people have died in the mountains search and 
rescue missions occupied 1800 amc workhours last year even though 
search communications have improved because of radios huts manager 
michael torrey said 
things have changed including our bodies thats what i 
noticed creaking up the valley way said lincoln cleveland 
madisons 1979 hut master but the most important things are the 
same the hut experience really was the best experience of my life

congress was fulfilling a deficit reduction 
agreement with president reagan when it passed a 11 trillion 
federal budget for fiscal 1989 but a hefty deficit remains and 
spending priorities have already shifted 
the budget approved by the house last month and the senate on 
monday by 5829 shows a deficit of nearly 142 billion when not 
counting sales of government assets which arent counted under the 
grammrudman budget balancing law 
the presidents office of management and budget says higher 
interest rates combined with government bailouts of banks could 
drive the deficit higher 
if it gets past 146 billion omb is required to order automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts under the grammrudman law 
and the spending plan doesnt come close to meeting 
grammrudmans goals for the years after fiscal 1989 which are 
designed to force a balanced budget by fiscal 1993 
this is a paltry pathetic and completely meaningless reduction 
of the deficit during times of economic prosperity complained 
sen william armstrong rcolo were just putting the whole 
problem off until after the election 
senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles dfla conceded 
weve taken some steps in the right direction but im afraid 
theres miles to go before we sleep 
the spending plan also was nearly two months after the april 15 
deadline creating confusion over the details of next years federal 
spending policy 
within total spending levels for military foreign aid and 
domestic programs that were set by last falls agreement with 
reagan the budget envisions increased federal spending on the space 
program education aids research fighting drugs and other 
electionyear priorities 
but the resolution itself is nonbinding acting only as a guide 
for production of the annual spending legislation for running the 
government and because of the delays the house and senate have 
been moving ahead with the regular spending bills that stray from 
the budgets priorities 
the senate appropriations committee voted to include less money 
for education and space programs shifting those funds to energy and 
interior agencies 
we urge the appropriations committee to follow our lead and 
support the nations future through increased funding for science 
and space programs said chiles who had pushed hard for that new 
spending 
those and other details of next years federal spending will be 
settled in the next few months before the start of fiscal 1989 
some of the policies envisioned in the budget 
no new taxes for the next year beyond the 14 billion enacted 
last december under the agreement with reagan 
overall budget increases of about half the inflation rate 
including 294 billion for the military 161 billion for foreign 
aid and 1692 billion for domestic agencies 
rejection of reagans call to cancel several domestic programs 
such as development grants to state and local governments 
full inflation increases for entitlement benefits including 
social security estimated at 42 percent 
a 21 percent increase over current levels for science space and 
technology programs including the space shuttle program and the 
superconducting super collider 
about 4 billion for antidrug programs plus a provision 
allowing more to be spent if congress and the president agree on a 
way to pay for it 
a 4 percent pay raise for the military and civilian federal 
workers 
money for hiring 900 additional air traffic controllers and for 
modernizing the air traffic control system 
overall spending would be about 5 billion above reagans request 
and 44 billion above this years level total revenues would be 
about 964 billion 
the deficit in fiscal 1987 was 1502 billion the administration 
estimates it will drop slightly to 146 billion in fiscal 1988 
which ends sept 30

vice president george bush said monday he 
expects to find himself differing increasingly with administration 
policy as the presidential campaign progresses 
bush said he would try to keep the situation to where i dont 
go out and do something to tear down or be negative about this 
president it may not always be that easy 
well probably be dragged into more and more of these things 
rather than less he said at a news conference at which he was 
questioned about his most recent departure from administration 
policy his advocacy of a delay in an offshore drilling lease off 
the northern california coast 
as i become the standard bearer of this party im going to be 
saying without regard to current administration position heres 
what george bush feels heres what i feel heres what my 
aspirations for the country are bush said 
he said he understood that somebody is going to be raising the 
question are you breaking with the president 
on the matter of the northern california offshore drilling 
however the administration came around to bushs point of view 
interior secretary donald hodel on monday night suspended plans for 
the controversial project 
hodels primaryeve action came after bush ran into criticism 
from democratic frontrunner michael dukakis over the oillease 
question 
asked about that criticism the vice president said i have a 
good deal more information than mr dukakis i made my living at 
it 
he said i do not favor shutting down all offshore drilling in 
this country 
dukakis also campaigning in california said of bushs call for 
delay on the project off northern california im pleased hes 
coming around but its kind of late im not for delaying that sale 
im for canceling it 
its easy to say well delay it until after the election 
what does that mean 
the proposed lease sale of the northern california tracts had 
been tentatively scheduled for february 1989 pending a decision by 
the next administration but hodels action announced in a 
statement issued monday night in washington puts the project on 
hold indefinitely 
bush meanwhile brushed aside polls that show him trailing 
dukakis in california as well as nationwide 
i like this concept of being behind in the polls he said 
bush said that in one survey twothirds of the respondents say 
that dukakis is more conservative than bush he said theres 
something weird about that 
he opened the news conference by reading a statement in which he 
endorsed legislation that would pay reparations to 
japaneseamericans interned during world war ii 
the administration has not taken a position on the bill 
it is only fair that our country provide apologies and 
reparations to those innocent japaneseamericans who suffered as a 
result of their internment he said 
bush spoke to reporters at chaffee high school where he met with 
students and faculty to talk about drug and alcohol abuse programs 
he told the students he favored jail sentences for people 
convicted of second offenses of drug use 
drug possession should lead to arrest and a sentence he 
said the sentence doesnt have to be jail time automatically 
there are other alternatives a hefty fine suspending a license 
putting a picture in the paper but failing to stay drugfree 
after arrest should mean time in jail the message should be 
unambiguous if you wont stop then well stop you

one of the two winners who split a 
record 514 million lottery jackpot says he was relieved he has to 
share the windfall so he doesnt have to face all this by myself 
honest to god i was hoping that somebody else hit it too 
said sacramento supermarket clerk randy pennington 26 who will 
divide north americas largest lottery jackpot with aircraft 
mechanic shelby carroll 53 of vacaville 
carroll a mechanic at travis air force base said he purchased 
100 worth of tickets himself because he couldnt find someone to 
share his bet 
the winners who found themselves instant celebrities monday 
each will receive 257 million annuities that pay 1028000 
annually after taxes for 20 years lottery officials said 
at a news conference attended by 100 people including cheering 
lottery agency workers the lotto 649 winners said they both used a 
feature of the lottery ticket terminals that randomly selects 
numbers for the player and that they were regular lotto players 
the winners in saturdays drawing said they plan to quit their 
jobs and have few immediate plans for the money except to help 
relatives in various ways 
both also said they would be ready for an onslaught of strangers 
interested in their bonanza but declined to discuss details of 
their plans 
pennington said that after buying his tickets i found a 
headsup penny 
every time ive ever found a headsup penny somethings always 
happened good to me im superstitious i guess he said 
pennington said he has been buying 5 to 10 in lottery tickets a 
week 
pennington was uncertain what hell use the money for beyond 
helping his family but said he would have more time to indulge his 
hobby of collecting antique toys he added that he has never won 
anything before 
being single he was asked if he had any trouble getting dates 
replied pennington no but who wants dates now i dont 
carroll said he couldnt find someone to match 50 with his 50 
to split the bet so he purchased 100 worth of tickets 
i asked my boss if he would like to share with me i said 
give me 50 and well split the winnings at the time it the 
jackpot was around 40 million i said really no one needs more 
than 40 million he said no i asked a couple more of the guys 
and they said no 
so carroll bet 100 himself because i had a feeling 
how does he feel now about not finding a partner im glad i 
feel sorry for them but im glad 
carrolls wife ila a clerk in the solano county courts said 
she plans to continue working for a time even though her husband is 
retiring 
her husband summed up the feelings both winners expressed about 
their good fortune its all happened so fast 
the jackpot eclipsed a 46 million prize last october in 
pennsylvania the biggest previous california jackpot that anybody 
won 254 million was split by two players in october 
the odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in 
14 million the winning numbers were 48 42 9 14 19 31 the

opposition laborites feuded after party leader neil 
kinnock said the countrys nuclear weapons should be used as 
bargaining chips in arms talks not just unilaterally scrapped 
kinnocks comments were taken as a strong indication he would 
discard the partys commitment to elimination of britains nuclear 
weapons 
party leftists have long been suspicious that kinnock intended to 
ditch the antinuclear policy before his next election battle 
against conservative prime minister margaret thatcher 
after he made his remarks sunday in a television interview party 
leftists on monday charged him with ignoring the socialist 
movements official policy 
kinnock said sunday that in the wake of the superpower treaty to 
eliminate those nations intermediaterange nuclear missiles a 
labor government would be wise to use the british arsenal as a 
bargaining chip instead of simply scrapping the weapons and shutting 
down us nuclear bases 
we would be complete fools whatever our politics to ignore 
the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and 
responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change 
said kinnock there is no need now for a somethingfornothing 
unilateralism 
polaris missiles now based in britain are due to be replaced in 
the early 1990s by the new and far more potent us trident missile 
system capable of hitting most soviet cities 
kinnock 46 who has been a lifetime antinuclear campaigner 
refused leftwing demands to reaffirm the unilateral disarmament 
pledge saying no i am not going to issue incantations 
tony benn a veteran of the labor left complained that kinnock 
was following previous labor prime ministers including harold 
wilson and james callaghan who that ensured britain remained a 
nuclear power 
the real problem for the labor party is not that we have never 
persuaded the electorate to support our policies but that we have 
never persuaded our leaders said benn 
benn is to run against kinnock for the leadership of the party at 
the annual conference in the fall but is given little chance of 
winning 
in 1982 three years after losing power to mrs thatcher labors 
policymaking annual conference voted for unilateral nuclear 
disarmament by a twothirds majority meaning it must be part of 
the election platform 
the pledge was widely seen as being one reason for labors two 
subsequent defeats by mrs thatcher in 1983 and 1987 
kinnocks new position is viewed as a shift to the right in an 
attempt to regain power the next election is to be held before 1992 
for the leftwingers in his party the kinnock switch evokes both 
anger and a sense of betrayal toward a politician who was once a 
leftwinger himself and had been an active member of britains 
antinuclear campaign since he was a student

a joint national proposal by the governors of 
ohio and new york to reduce acid rain shows ohio is finally 
reading the writing on the wall and seeking help to curb pollution 
from its coalfired power plants a congressman says 
on monday ohio gov richard celeste and new york gov mario 
cuomo made public their proposal to reduce polluting sulfur dioxide 
emissions from utility sources by 10 million tons by the year 2003 
the plan calls for authorizing 900 million a year from the 
federal government to finance up to 50 percent of the capital costs 
most of that money would come from having the oil industry take over 
the cost of filling the strategic petroleum reserve 
the polluters themselves would have to raise about 900 million a 
year under the deal 
rep gerry sikorski dminn said it represents significant 
progress anytime ohio and new york can agree on acid rain 
sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been 
blamed as a major cause of acid rain which environmentalists say is 
destroying waters and woodlands in the northeast 
much of the sulfur dioxide comes from coalburning power plants 
along the ohio river 
sikorski a member of the house energy and commerce committee is 
the main sponsor of an acid rain control bill pending in committee 
his bill would mandate a 10millionton reduction in emissions by 
1998 
this agreement shows that there is renewed seriousness about 
dealing with the issue sikorski said it indicates that ohio is 
finally reading the writing on the wall this could be their last 
good chance at legislation that assists them with their cleanup 
costs 
but the proposal drew fire from other lawmakers 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said that while he 
is encouraged by the dialogue between ohio and new york on acid 
rain he sees nothing new in the proposal 
the key element of any effort to deal with acid rain has to be 
time said byrd and this proposal does not allow enough time 
for the development of cleancoal technologies coal is essential to 
americas national security and we cannot afford to adopt an acid 
rain policy that would devastate the coal industry 
rep thomas luken dohio said the proposal would hurt ohio and 
accused celeste of not speaking for ohioans on the issue 
regardless of the financing gimmicks said luken ohio 
consumers will pay millions of dollars and ohio will lose 
thousands of jobs for no known benefit 
ohio next to coalrich west virginia has a significant 
coalmining industry 
sen robert stafford rvt said he believes the proposal 
represents a breakthrough because it is the first time a major 
emitter of sulfur dioxide ohio has attempted to come to grips with 
the acid rain problem 
stafford who is ranking republican on the senate environment and 
public works committee has been a major proponent of acid rain 
control and is a cosponsor of legislation authored by sen george 
mitchell dmaine that would reduce emissions by 12 million tons 
i think its a very encouraging development said stafford 
adding that he expects that the senate committee will want to review 
the ohionew york proposal and possibly amend the pending 
legislation to take advantage of the initiative 
the proposal an amendment to the clean air act calls for 
reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in three phases 35 million 
tons by 1993 another 45 million tons by 1998 and another 2 million 
tons by 2003 
the agreement would also establish a 10year 25 billion 
expanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions in 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
daniel weiss washington representative of the sierra club 
called the new proposal encouraging because it comes in part from 
ohio the largest single emitter of sulfur dioxide in the nation 
this is a statesmanlike proposal but it doesnt include enough 
reductions soon enough to adequately protect public health or the 
environment said weiss 
however he said the environmental group believes that the 
proposal will help move acid rain control legislation in congress 
susan k roth spokeswoman for the edison electric institute 
said the deadlines in the celestecuomo proposal are not flexible 
enough to allow for the use of new cleancoal technologies and she 
said the additional costs to the oil industry would be passed along 
to consumers 
we dont see that this is going to give us any better longterm 
reductions than the program that is already in place said ms 
roth

brookline is the boston suburb where dukakis grew up and lives 
today 
in his remarks to the gop audience bush ticked off a number of 
issues on which he said he and dukakis differ 
i favor the death penalty for drug kingpins and he opposes 
it said the vice president 
ill never understand he went on why michael dukakis 
vetoed a bill providing for the pledge of allegiance to be said in 
the schools of massachusetts i favor the pledge of allegiance being 
said anywhere and everywhere 
dukakis has said he vetoed the legislation after being advised by 
the state supreme court that it was unconstitutional 
bushs freewheeling attack on the dukakis was the sort of 
offensive many republicans have been advising as a way to overcome 
the advantage dukakis currently holds in opinion polls of voters 
at his news conference bush dismissed surveys suggesting he 
trails dukakis in california and nationwide 
he said that in one survey twothirds of the respondents said 
dukakis was more conservative than bush 
theres something weird about that he said 
bush was certain to sweep the 175 delegates at stake in 
californias winnertakeall republican primary all of his gop 
opponents have dropped out of the race and endorsed him for the 
partys nomination to succeed ronald reagan 
dukakis was expected to pick up enough delegates in the days 
four primaries to clinch the democratic presidential nomination 
bush supporters contend that the public has a distorted image of 
the massachusetts governor because he has been involved in a race 
against jesse jackson a contest in which dukakis came across as a 
moderate 
a major goal for the republicans is to portray dukakis as a 
liberal who would return the country to big spending domestic 
programs 
the massachusetts governor twitted bush over the vice presidents 
decision to call sunday for a delay in offshore oil drilling off the 
northern california coast dukakis called the decision an effort to 
curry favor among california voters who tend to feel strongly about 
environmental issues 
the issue subsided when interior secretary donald hodel suspended 
plans to lease 11 million acres off the northern california coast 
for oil drilling 
he can make a political challenge bush responded to dukakis 
criticism and i will be challenging him as to what he thinks is a 
great energy program for the united states of america 
bush said i have a good deal more information than mr 
dukakis i made my living at it oil drilling 
bush drawing a contrast between his position and that of 
dukakis said i do not favor shutting down all offshore drilling 
in this country 
he said their differences would be aired and i am i think on 
the right side 
dukakis who speaks fluent spanish has shown strength in some 
surveys among californias large hispanic population but bush said 
he was confident of doing well among the same voters 
on the hispanics i have some understanding there he said 
because three of my grandchildren are half mexican his son 
jebs wife is mexican 
i think i understand the heartbeat of the hispanic community 
he went on 
bushs position on the offshore drilling was another step away 
from reagan administration policy which favors more drilling and 
the vice president said more such differences would emerge 
as i become the standardbearer of this party im going to be 
saying without regard to current administration position heres 
what george bush feels he said 
well probably be dragged into more of these things rather than 
less but i will try to keep it that i dont go out and do something 
to tear down or be negative about this president it may not always 
be that easy

nonsubscribers a ticket order form is included 
i love it because youre definitely going to read it and it has 
the confidence to have humor it says that opera is for everyone

reject the lungs he received in a may 7 transplant doctors say 
its a definite setback no question about it his condition is 
pretty serious dr seshadri raju who led the university of

japan is trimming its huge trade surplus by 
expanding imports and stepping up overseas investment the ministry 
of international trade and industry said today 
but the united states must do its part for the world economy by 
easing its budget and trade deficits the ministry said in a report 
summing up japans foreign trade in 1987 
it also said japan should play a bigger role in asian development 
through direct investment and importing more of the regions 
manufactured goods 
the report issued annually since 1949 praises ongoing 
structural changes that have improved access to the japanese market 
for foreign exporters of manufactured goods 
manufactured imports are increasing rapidly and the 
distribution system in japan is undergoing a change said atsushi 
oi head of the ministrys international trade research office 
japans trade surplus fell in fiscal 1987 for the first time in 
six years from 10165 billion in 1986 to 9428 billion according 
to japanese figures 
still japans trade surplus with the united states continued to 
climb hitting 49 billion in december 1987 from 47 billion a 
year earlier the latest government figures show 
oi said increased exports of capital goods to the united states 
contributed to the increase capital goods exports are rising as 
japanese firms send equipment to set up us production facilities 
secondly and this has a bigger share is that american 
companies look to excellent capital goods exports from japan and 
install these in their plants oi said 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa said exports bound for the 
united states will fall from the present 40 percent share of japans 
total to 2530 percent as japan restructures its exportdriven 
economy toward domestic demand 
he did not give a time frame 
the trade ministry report says japanese imports grew by 93 
percent in 1987 over the previous year while export volume rose 
only 03 percent 
oi said the united states can lessen its trade deficit by cutting 
down on excessive consumer demand expanding production facilities 
and revamping its export policy 
the report says the us trade deficit hit 1712 billion in 
1987 up 15 billion over 1986 
us exports to japan rose by a meager 84 percent in 1987 but 
those from asias newly industrialized countries of south korea 
taiwan and hong kong soared by 503 percent the report says 
the white paper is cautious about the future of japans 
restructuring it says that while imports are growing along with 
domestic demand nations awash in surplus funds like japan must 
expand imports and provide a stable supply of capital to debtor 
nations 
the role of japan from now on is to help asian countries create 
a region of development that is open to the rest of the world 
oi said

one year after a former top aide 
accused him of rigging elections drug trafficking and corruption 
gen manuel antonio noriega still firmly controls the government and 
may well run for president next year 
the accusations were made by col roberto diaz herrera last june 
after he was demoted from secondincommand they emboldened 
thousands of panamanians to take to the streets to demand noriegas 
ouster 
diaz herrera was arrested and sent into exile in venezuela 
a similar fate befell eric arturo delvalle who as president 
tried to fire noriega as defense forces chief in february after two 
us grand juries indicted the general on drug trafficking charges 
noriega ousted delvalle who went into hiding in panama 
on monday opposition leaders called on latin american 
governments to mediate efforts to remove the general from power a 
goal washington has failed to achieve through economic sanctions and 
negotiations 
but noriega has indicated he will not permit any mediation that 
would ease him out of office and the government already is making 
plans to hold elections in may 1989 with or without the opposition 
progovernment groups are mentioning noriega as a likely 
candidate of the governments democratic revolutionary party in next 
years presidential elections 
a source close to noriega told the associated press monday night 
that any discussions with latin american leaders would amount to 
talks with the united states by proxy 
and the general is not leaving said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the united states and the opposition must 
understand that 
the reagan administration announced last month that its effort to 
remove noriega through negotiations had failed the widespread 
mostly nonviolent opposition demonstrations that began one year ago 
also failed to loosen the generals grip on power 
a foreign ministry statement released monday night assailed the 
opposition call to latin americanize the panamanian crisis as an 
effort to hide the deliberate execution of a vast plan of 
internal destabilization against the government 
noriega has strengthened his position by forming the strategic 
military council a group of 20 of his closest collaborators they 
include the commander of the elite year 2000 battalion another 
troop commander and key officers in other sections of the 
15000strong defense forces 
they supersede the chiefs of staff said an opposition 
leader also speaking privately they are younger than the chiefs 
of staff and are the ones making all decisions with noriega 
dr ricardo arias calderon head of the christian democrat party 
said the council may have promoted the breakdown in talks with the 
united states 
they probably want noriega to stay on longer and get rid of the 
older members of the defense forces command he said 
chief of staff col marcos justines who negotiated with us 
representatives is not a member of the council 
on monday night noriega and his generals dressed in civilian 
clothes accompanied president manuel solis palma and other top 
military officers to attend a play depicting us interventions in 
panama the sketch was performed by members of the defense forces 
elite antiterrorist unit 
hundreds of people chanted antiamerican slogans and applauded 
noriega as he shook hands with civilians and military recruits

a cigarette lighters flame may have 
sparked the methane gas explosion in a coal mine shaft that led to 
the deaths of at least 46 men a national television network 
reported 
also monday mine owners defended the rescue operation despite 
the revelation that a radio operator told six trapped miners to get 
off a radio channel just hours after wednesdays blast 
the six were discovered alive saturday after officials had 
insisted there were no signs of life in the stolzenbach mine in 
borken 72 miles northeast of frankfurt 
a statement from the rescue team said searchers had found another 
miners body early today bringing the total confirmed dead to 47 
four men were still missing in the mines north field which 
officials said had the highest concentrations of deadly carbon 
monoxide 
prosecutors are investigating whether an open flame may have 
ignited the gas explosion the zdf television network reported 
monday night zdf quoting unidentified officials said cigarette 
lighters were found inside the mine 
it said miners were known to have smoked on the job but a mining 
official said he doubted that was true 
we have very strict regulations against smoking in the mine 
and if someone were to be caught doing it they would be immediately 
fired said wulf boettcher an official with the preussen elektra 
utility company that operates the borken mine 
kassel prosecutor stephan walcher said a full investigation was 
launched into the cause of the disaster but he refused to elaborate 
or to say whether a cigarette lighter may have caused the explosion 
high concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the mine delayed 
search efforts on monday exhausted rescuers were forced to renew 
their oxygen supplies repeatedly 
authorities said that because of the deadly carbon monoxide 
fumes there was little chance the missing miners would be found 
alive 
owners of the coal mine acknowledged sunday that a radio operator 
told the six surviving miners to stop sending messages from the 
pocket of air where they were trapped because he thought they were 
another search team 
heinz cramer a technical director for preussen elekta told 
reporters monday that failure to recognize the radio contact as a 
sign of life from the trapped miners had not endangered the men 
we knew that the area where the men were found presented the 
best possibility of finding survivors and thats where we began 
drilling cramer said 
the six were finally discovered after their sounds were picked up 
by a television crews microphone lowered into a shaft 500 feet 
beneath the earth

morton thiokol sole manufacturer of solidfuel 
space shuttle boosters blamed for the challenger disaster has 
dropped out of the competition for a 12 billion contract to make 
boosters for the 1990s 
the chicagobased company announced monday that it wants to 
concentrate on redesigning the booster used on challenger whose 
fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven 
astronauts aboard 
a presidential commission blamed the jan 28 1986 explosion on 
a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a thiokolbuilt 
solidfuel booster igniting the main fuel tank 
the motor redesign is almost complete with a test firing set for 
next month at cape canaveral fla said rocky raab a company 
spokesman in utah 
thiokols utah plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle 
boosters and the national aeronautics and space admininistration 
must look elsewhere for producers of the nextgeneration version 
the advanced solid rocket motor 
one of the principal reasons that morton thiokol is not bidding 
is because we are acutely aware of our responsibilities in the 
redesigned solid rocket motor program u edwin garrison the 
companys group vice president for aerospace said in an 
announcement released in chicago 
nasa plans to use thiokols redesigned motor when it resumes 
shuttle flights 
the advanced motor will be used in the mid1990s and nasa 
anticipates healthy competition for the advanced booster contract 
despite thiokols decision agency spokeswoman sarah keegan said 
from washington 
less than two months ago thiokol officials insisted the company 
would compete for the 12 billion contract 
although bidding has not opened raab said three other parties 
have expressed interest united technologies a team of lockheed and 
aerojet and another team consisting of hercules atlantic research 
corp and martin marietta 
thiokols announcement followed an earlier nasa announcement that 
it wanted to build a governmentowned plant to produce the larger 
rocket motors and have a private manufacturer operate the plant 
under contract 
nasa has earmarked 27 million of its current budget for design 
and initial construction of a new booster plant somewhere on the 
gulf coast officials have said they plan to add 65 million from 
next years budget for the project they estimate it will take at 
least 10 years to make the plant operational 
the proposal to shift shuttle booster construction from thiokols 
plant to a governmentowned factory near water was criticized 
earlier this year as unfair to thiokol by state and company 
officials and members of utahs congressional delegation the 
critics included gov norm bangerter and republican sen jake garn 
a hearing requested by garn on nasas plans is scheduled before a 
senate appropriations subcommittee wednesday 
thiokol which makes and sells chemicals rockets and salt plans 
to invest 200 million in coming years to modernize its northern 
utah plant in order to seek other space and defense business raab 
said 
the plant 90 miles north of salt lake city is one of the states 
largest private employers with 2500 workers 
thiokol intends to go after the air force advanced launch system 
a strapon booster and other contracts raab said 
the companys announcement got a negative reaction on wall 
street where thiokol shares fell 1125 to close at 39875 in 
trading monday on the new york stock exchange 
robert bartels an analyst with william blair investment firm in 
chicago said that if thiokol pursued the advanced shuttle rocket 
contract they are in effect raising questions about their own 
current designs the company feels they have a good design 
bartels said the company may believe that the advanced rocket 
program may not be approved by congress and that the redesign 
program for the challenger rocket will be 
theres been a lot of speculation that the company will sell 
the aerospace business and is not willing to commit to it in the 
long term he said 
raab said thiokol intends to keep the aerospace unit which 
contributes 40 percent of company sales

separatist tamil rebels blew up an 
indian army jeep today killing one soldier and wounding four just 
hours before hundreds of indian troops began boarding nearby ships 
to return home 
one sri lankan officer called the attack a show of strength 
by the rebels who have fought a fiveyear war for greater autonomy 
indian officials said their at least partial troop withdrawal would 
go on as scheduled 
sri lankan military officers said the jeep was patrolling about 
six miles south of the port city of trincomalee when the rebels 
detonated a mine under it just a few hours later indian sodliers 
began pulling out as scheduled in trincomalee 140 miles northeast 
of colombo 
it was a show of strength by the rebels said the sri lankan 
officer who cannot be identified under briefing rules its a 
slap in the face 
the indian high commission or embassy confirmed the attack but 
gave no details but deputy high commissioner nirupam sen said the 
attack did not affect the pullout of the first contingent of indian 
peacekeeping soldiers and weapons including sovietmade t72 tanks 
and 105mm and 120mm artillery 
at least 3000 of the estimated 50000 indian soldiers in sri 
lanka were scheduled to depart for home today by ship from 
trincomalee 
indian defense minister kc pant said last week that excess 
troops and armor would be sent home but announced no firm 
timetable for a complete withdrawal 
india began sending in soldiers last july to enforce a peace 
accord aimed at ending the civil war on this island off its southern 
coast the deployment increased in october after rebels renounced 
the peace plan refused to surrender their weapons and resumed 
fighting 
the indian troops stationed only in the north and east where 
tamils are in the majority had been ordered to disarm the rebel 
fighters 
predominantly hindu tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people and claim they are discriminated against by the 
mostly buddhist sinhalese who constitute 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and military 
the peace accord reached by the india and the sri lankan 
government of president junius jayewardene calls for election of 
district councils to give the nations nine provinces greater 
autonomy 
elections have been held in six provinces so far and voting is 
scheduled for thursday in the predominantly sinhalese southern 
province 
balloting has been postponed in the tamildominated northern and 
eastern provinces because of the fighting 
india a major regional power negotiated the peace accord and 
agreed to police it partly for fear of sympathies that its own 60 
million tamils feel for the rebel cause 
though the indians have been unable to stem the fighting a 
string of recent victories led them to agree with sri lanka on at 
least a partial pullout 
the indian presence has been criticized by many sinhalese who 
view it as a threat to sri lankan independence

opponents of the reagan administrations 
proposal for extensive oil leasing off the northern california coast 
claimed credit for the decision to suspend the plan but said they 
remain wary it wont be scuttled 
interior secretary donald hodel late monday made the announcement 
to halt work on the proposal to lease 11 million offshore acres 
the decision effectively pushes the sale back at least until to 
august 1989 
hodels action came on the eve of the california primary and a 
day after vice president george bush softened his prodrilling 
stance and called for the offshore plan to be delayed 
i take that as good news bush a onetime texas oilman who 
previously had expressed unconditional support for drilling said 
when informed of hodels decision while campaigning in southern 
california 
democratic presidential hopefuls michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson have advocated stopping all offshore drilling 
this is an attempt to try to get bush off the hook said 
richard charter a washington lobbyist who represents california 
coastal communties in their fight against the drilling 
he said the announcement also could be an effort to prevent 
congress from imposing a oneyear moratorium on the sale the house 
appropriations committee is scheduled on wednesday to consider such 
a plan to delay leasing until 1990 
anmother critic humboldt county supervisor wesley chesbro said 
weve succeeded beyond our wildest dreams in making this an issue 
of importance to the national campaign 
however he added temporary political delays are great but 
theyre not what were looking for 
hodel said in a statement that it appears that no valid public 
purpose would be served by preparation and publication of a final 
environmental impact statement containing a proposed course of 
action for lease sale 91 
the department estimates that the area proposed for the lease 
could contain up to 790 million barrels of oil a twomonth supply 
for the united states and between 820 billion and 15 trillion 
cubic feet of natural gas it says there is a 5050 chance of 
finding the petroleum 
the proposed lease sale of tracts off mendocino and humboldt 
counties had been tentatively scheduled for february 1989 pending a 
decision by the next administration 
at least six months is needed between the reports conclusion and 
a sale due to hearings and other preparatory work department 
spokesman david prosperi said the environmental report could have 
been prepared as early as august 
hodel indicated he was reluctant to take the action 
i believe we do not have to choose between development of 
offshore oil or protection of the california coast he said 
experience shows we can have both 
dukakis had criticized bush earlier monday for coming around 
to his latest position kind of late 
and the democratic frontrunner said its easy to say well 
delay it until after the election what does that mean 
bushs aides acknowledged that his statement on sunday 
represented a major concession to strong bipartisan environmental 
sentiments in the state 
george bush recognizes the importance of environmental and 
qualityoflife issues in california said chief of staff craig 
fuller 
charter said that if bush becomes president hodels action 
represents only a sixmonth reprieve for lease sale 91 the 
lobbyist said the vice president has not made a clear commitment to 
do away with the sale noting that there are a lot of qualifiers 
in his statement 
the western oil and gas association said it supported hodels 
decision for a reasonable delay 
were political realists said craig hume a spokesman for 
the industry group right now it is clear that the people of 
california especially the people of northern california are not 
comfortable with the environmental studies that now exist

while most kids spend their time playing 
with toy trucks and tractors migrant children often play in the 
hot dusty strawberry fields of florida with the real thing 
the harsh world of heavy equipment and soilcutting tools can 
mean deep gashing wounds burns severed limbs and sometimes loss 
of life 
it was in one of those strawberry patches on an april day last 
year that 7yearold karla polanco nearly lost her leg as she 
dangled it over the rear of a truck while her parents picked 
strawberries nearby 
somebody wanted the truck moved so her 12yearold playmate 
hopped in the front seat shifted into reverse and slammed karlas 
leg between the rig and a trailer 
and last week 5yearold fidencio jaurequis right arm was 
ripped off at a dade city farm when he accidentally stuck it in a 
tomato sorting machine while his mother worked nearby doctors were 
unable to reattach the limb because the injury was so severe the 
boy was listed in good condition monday at tampa general hospital 
with their parents working in the fields from sunrise to sunset 
and few available daycare services hundreds of migrant children 
are left to fend for themselves in empty homes or busy fields 
we see the evidence all the time cut fingers because the 
children stuck them in a fan burns because the children were hungry 
and tried to cook something to eat while their parents were off at 
work said lourdes villanueva a former migrant who runs a 
daycare program in plant city 
in the camps where migrants live stories abound of children 
maimed or killed in accidents in the fields many accidents go 
unreported to authorities as families move on to other states 
migrants say 
i remember this one woman some years back who brought a 
6monthold baby out into the fields said concha calderon who 
has four children the baby got too hot out there and died she 
didnt have anybody to watch it 
there is no reliable estimate of the largely undocumented migrant 
farmworker population in southern hillsborough county but social 
workers guess there are between 25000 and 45000 people 
the redlands christian migrant association the countys primary 
provider of migrant day care has only 668 available spots for 
migrant children and a waiting list of 575 
there are many more out there but they dont qualify for 
programs like migrant headstart because they didnt travel as 
farmworkers during the year experts say 
even a few years ago i would say there were a lot of workers 
still traveling back and forth from state to state ms 
villanueva said but now i think more are just staying here and 
working odd jobs during the summer because you just cant make as 
much money traveling any more

a pipeline company has been fined a record 15 
million and ordered to clean up its disposal sites containing toxic 
pcbs in 14 states 
texas eastern gas pipeline co agreed to the 10year cleanup 
which could cost 400 million in a proposed consent decree filed in 
us district court in houston the justice department announced 
monday 
the cleanup will take place at up to 89 gas pipeline compressor 
stations along the companys 10000milelong pipeline which runs 
through texas louisiana arkansas mississippi alabama missouri 
tennessee illinois kentucky indiana ohio pennsylvania maryland 
and new jersey 
the company used lubricating oil containing pcbs a fire 
retardant in turbine compressors and regularly dumped liquids 
including the pcbs in pits until may 1987 officials said 
pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls are a suspected carcinogen 
believed to cause birth defects miscarriages reproductive failures 
and tumors 
texas eastern also burned pipeline liquids including pcbs in open 
pits at many of the 89 locations as late as 1979 and the combustion 
process may have created residues of dioxin another hazardous waste 
the 15 million penalty will be a sharp reminder that failure 
to comply with the environmental laws will strike a heavy blow to 
the pocketbooks of wouldbe violators said roger marzulla 
assistant attorney general in charge of the justice departments 
land and natural resources division 
the fine is a record in civil penalties for violations of federal 
environmental law in disposing of the pcbs and associated pipeline 
fluids the anticipated 400 million cleanup also appeared to be a 
record for a private party in a federal environmental case marzulla 
said 
sen frank lautenberg dnj who heads the environmental 
oversight panel said the settlement was long overdue 
he accused the environmental protection agency for not acting 
fast enough 
its too bad that we had to drag epa by the collar to get them 
to take this action said lautenberg 
but epa spokesman david cohen said it is largely as a result 
of epas own investigation that the settlement was worked out 
looking back at an investigation of this scope i suppose that 
there are points here and there where it might have been possible to 
expedite matters a little faster said cohen but when all 
things are considered what we got was an excellent resolution 
under the decree texas eastern must clean up any sites at which 
pcb contamination is found in concentrations greater than 25 parts 
per million in areas where public access is restricted in sites 
open to the public the company must clean up concentrations greater 
than 10 parts per million 
the decree also requires extensive sampling and analysis of soil 
on and off the sites as well as of streams and groundwater the 
groundwater monitoring program may continue for up to 20 years 
the company said it will seek recovery of the cleanup costs from 
insurance and other claims through rate hikes 
it said it believes the 15 million penalty is inappropriate 
but agreed to pay it in order to expedite the settlement and 
avoid the uncertainties of litigation

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who meets 
with the soviet foreign minister this week chided moscow for 
seeking a political deal to improve relations but referred to 
mikhail gorbachev as a great leader 
the soviets keep hinting that they will renew diplomatic 
relations with us if we agree to their proposal for an international 
conference on the middle east shamir said in a speech here monday 
i dont believe we should pay for the resumption of diplomatic 
relations they broke them and they should renew them 
in an interview published in the new york times shamir praised 
gorbachev who has instituted reforms in the soviet union 
my observation is to bring a new message a new idea to such a 
great country it could be done only by a great leader shamir 
told the times 
less than two years ago the leader of the hardline likud party 
described the soviet union under gorbachev as old wine in new 
bottles 
in his speech shamir reiterated his opposition to an 
international conference which also was included in a united states 
peace plan put forth by secretary of state george shultz in a visit 
to the middle east this week 
shamir who met with shultz in israel on sunday said it is an 
illusion that an outside power can successfully offer its own 
plan before negotiations begin indeed he said that seems only 
to retard the movement towards direct negotiations without 
preconditions which is the only way to settle disputes between 
sovereign nations 
israel seeks direct talks with jordan and with palestinian arab 
representatives who are not members of the palestine liberation 
organization which shamir said cites israels destruction as a 
goal in its charter 
shamir plans to meet soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze at the united nations this week there have been 
several recent contacts between the countries although they do not 
have formal diplomatic relations 
shamirs speech to the conference of presidents of major jewish 
organizations included a pointed reference to soviet support of arab 
opponents of israel while the soviet union has important 
interests and connections in the region he said we would have 
been much happier had it not supported elements who want to destroy 
us 
but there is no reason we should help enhance the soviet 
position among our enemies at the expense of our interests that is 
one of the reasons we oppose an international conference 
on the issue of political concessions in exchange for diplomatic 
relations with the soviet union shamir said in no other case 
does the soviet union condition its diplomatic relations on 
political concessions there is no reason why israel should be 
treated differently from any other nation

the state decided not to prosecute former 
gov evan mecham for urging supporters to hide their support for him 
if called for jury duty in his criminal trial as prosecutors 
prepared to rest their case 
we do not believe it is a prosecutable case attorney general 
bob corbin said monday referring to mechams comments in april 
some say it was a joke some say it wasnt a joke it is a case we 
do not wish to pursue 
assistant attorney general barnett lotstein said he expects to 
rest his case today after testimony by accountant leroy johnson who 
told jurors monday the mecham campaign was badly overdrawn when it 
received a 350000 loan in october 1986 
mecham and willard mecham his brother and 1986 campaign 
treasurer are charged with concealing the loan on financial reports 
required by the state they have denied the charges 
they havent proved anything the ousted republican governor 
told reporters monday prosecutors have failed to present anything 
that hasnt been public information for seven months 
mecham says he was joking when he said at an april 18 republican 
legislative district meeting that supporters if called for jury 
duty in his trial should have a lapse of memory regarding their 
support for him 
four days later corbin began an investigation into whether 
mecham violated any law including one that prohibits asking 
somebody to commit a crime or help commit a crime 
i dont know why he opened the investigation in the first 
place mecham defense attorney michael scott said after being told 
of corbins decision anyone who knows anything about the 
statement knows it was said tongueincheek at a private meeting 
on monday former top gubernatorial aide donna carlson testified 
that she warned mecham during the campaign to distance himself from 
the man who loaned him the money tempe developer barry wolfson 
also former mecham finance committee member vern gasser read the 
jury a set of notes he took during a committee meeting in the fall 
of 1986 the notes say show evan borrowed money and dont show 
borrowed money and some say they appear to reflect a discussion 
on whether to disclose the loan 
however gasser said he couldnt recall the conversation or what 
the notes meant maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan 
allowed gasser to read the notes despite defense objections 
mecham is charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted on all counts willard mecham faces three 
similar counts and up to 9 years in prison if convicted 
mecham took office in january 1987 he was removed from office 
april 4 when the senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment 
counts

more than 4500 wood mill workers went on 
strike in three states in a showdown over efforts to restore wages 
and benefits lost two years ago 
were prepared to stay out till doomsday and the way things 
are going that may not be very long sam moore a union local 
president in sweet home said as the strike began monday 
the strike shut down 18 wood products operations in the oregon 
washington and montana affecting willamette industries inc of 
portland champion international corp of stamford conn and daw 
forest products co of lake oswego 
the walkout followed the collapse last week of negotiations with 
the international woodworkers of americaus and the western 
council of industrial workers 
the portlandbased unions have vowed to restore wages and 
benefits lost in 1986 after a series of unsuccessful strikes 
we already took a 17 percent wage cut and twoyear freeze 
ken reynolds said as he walked a picket line outside a willamette 
sawmill in lebanon wed have another twoyear freeze if we accept 
willamettes last offer that doesnt cut it 
the first step toward restoration was taken last week when the 
unions announced a tentative agreement with bohemia inc of eugene 
the fouryear pact largely restored wages lost two years ago union 
officials said 
the unions want to use the bohemia agreement as an industry 
standard but other companies have rejected it 
the international woodworkers bargains for 450 workers at 
champions roseburg plywood plant the other union represents about 
200 champion workers at a klickitat wash sawmill and 1800 
champion workers at sawmills and plywood plants at missoula bonner 
and libby mont 
the two unions also represent about 1300 oregon workers at five 
lumber mills four plywood mills two wood products plants a 
machine shop and a logging shop operated by willamette in lebanon 
sweet home dallas and albany 
the international woodworkers also represents a daw sawmill in 
bend and the other union represents a daw plywood plant in redmond 
each mill has about 400 union workers 
willamette spokeswoman said the companys threeyear offer 
included bonuses the first two years and a 35 percent wage increase 
the third year the average plywood worker makes 977 per hour she 
said 
union leaders oppose bonuses because the base wage rate remains 
the same although annual wages are boosted 
industry sources say bohemia offered increases of 5 percent the 
first year and 4 percent in each of the next three years 
in 1986 the international woodworkers and the lumber production 
and industrial workers which later became the wciw staged a 
5week strike against weyerhaeuser affecting 7500 workers in the 
biggest regional timber walkout in the last 25 years 
that year 1100 other workers walked off their jobs at 
willamette industries and other job actions struck daw wi forest

justice minister annagreta leijon 
resigned today after disclosures she authorized an unsupervised 
freelance investigation into the 1986 assassination of prime 
minister olof palme 
her resignation was intended to head off a vote of noconfidence 
in parliament that could have toppled the minority government of 
palmes successor ingvar carlsson 
carlsson said he regretted mrs leijons departure and would 
likely appoint her to a new cabinet if his social democratic party 
is returned to office after elections next september 
opposition leaders accused her of overstepping her authority by 
bypassing the official investigation into the palme killing and 
approving a secret probe by publisher ebbe carlsson who is not 
related to the prime minister 
public furor grew over reports the publishers 
governmentassigned bodyguard was caught smuggling illegal 
wiretapping equipment into sweden and that the probe was funded by a 
343000 contribution from a banker 
bengt westerberg the liberal party leader said questions 
remained about the role in the unauthorized probe of the security 
police which supplied ebbe carlsson with a bodyguard and unofficial 
support 
the publisher was investigating possible iranian involvement in 
palmes murder under the theory palme was killed because he 
uncovered and tried to halt illegal arms sales to iran by a private 
weapons manufacturer 
conservative party leader carl bildt welcomed mrs leijons 
resignation if people want to remain confident in their faith in 
sweden as a society of justice this was the only possible 
decision he said 
the prime minister said industry minister thage g peterson would 
be acting justice minister until the next election 
mrs leijon 49 was the third justice minister to resign since 
the social democrats took office in 1982 
in october sten wickbom quit after a convicted spy escaped while 
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison in 1983 ove rainer 
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes 
analysts said the leijon affair threatened to hurt the social 
democrats in balloting next september 
an opinion survey published last weekend showed the social 
democrats polling 447 percent against a combined 435 percent for 
the three nonsocialist opposition parties 
the balance of power is held by the small communist party 
the social democrats who have been in office for all but six 
years since world war ii have 159 seats in the 349member 
legislature

federal agents seized 21000 in cash from the 
chicago apartment and business office of noah robinson democratic 
presidential candidate jesse jacksons halfbrother newspapers 
reported today 
robinson 45 was arrested saturday in greenville sc on 
charges of hiring someone to attack a witness in the slaying of a 
former employee 
robinson has denied the charges and accused officials of 
targeting him because of jacksons high profile and of trying to 
turn him into the billy carter of the jesse jackson campaign 
robinsons chicago attorney jerome rotenburg said cash seized 
was from robinsons chain of fast food restaurants according to 
todays editions of the chicago tribune and chicago suntimes 
rotenburgs office telephones went unanswered monday night and 
fbi spokesman jim kuntzelman said no information could be released 
the tribune also said federal authorities had seized the records 
of robinsons businesses in chicago and were examining them 
robinson on monday posted 50000 on a 500000 bond on charges 
of accessory to a felony intimidation of a witness obstruction of 
justice and conspiracy 
i have never been involved in criminal anything he told 
courtroom observers and reporters while awaiting his bond hearing 
police arrested another man at robinsons chicago residence on 
sunday and charged him with being an accessory to the stabbing of 
the witness janice denise rosemond who survived the attack in her 
greenville apartment in december 1987 
ms rosemond was a witness to the murder of leroy hambone 
barber a former employee of robinson who was shot outside a 
building owned by robinson in downtown greenville authorities said 
the man arrested in the chicago apartment holandus jake 
oliver 41 was named as a coconspirator in one of the warrants 
filed against robinson but authorities declined to elaborate on 
what role oliver allegedly played in the stabbing 
robinson said oliver worked for him in 1974 and recently watched 
robinsons apartment in chicago when he was out of town 
bond for oliver was set monday at 100000 
ms rosemond was stabbed after testifying before a grand jury 
about barbers death she later recanted her testimony 
robinson said he believes the charges against him stem from his 
attempts to help exconvicts and others in need and from political 
forces trying to derail jacksons bid for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
greenville police chief mike bridges said robinsons arrest has 
nothing to do with political motivations when we felt we had enough 
to charge him and arrest him thats what we did we treated this 
case like any other case

critical information is disappearing momentarily 
from air traffic controllers screens in airports for dallas 
houston los angeles and atlanta because of a computer glitch a 
newspaper reported today 
information on altitude airspeed aircraft types call signs and 
destinations vanish from radar screens for up to 20 seconds said 
the dallas morning news quoting federal aviation administration 
officials 
faa officials do not believe the error in a computer program 
presents a hazard to safety lawrence parrent assistant air traffic 
manager at dallasfort worth international airport said monday 
the radar has not failed parrent said the primary target 
is still there the radar image and a fourdigit number assigned 
to each aircraft known as a target by controllers remain on 
the screen 
controllers are concerned about the glitch and are monitoring the 
faas progress in fixing it said edward f mullin a local 
representative of the national air traffic controllers association 
its a new program and there are some software problems he 
said i dont think thats anything unusual were not totally 
comfortable with it but theyre working hard on the system 
the information disappears when the program detects a glitch in 
the system parrent said 
when information is about to disappear an alarm sounds and 
controllers have up to five seconds to write down the information or 
memorize it faa officials told the morning news controllers handle 
up to 10 aircraft at a time 
the new program offers many features that improve the margin of 
safety and bugs will be worked out parrent said 
however the newspaper said some aviation experts and controllers 
voiced concern that although horizontal distance between aircraft 
still can be tracked on the screen the glitch could cause problems 
the risk is exacerbated if the problem occurs when aircraft are 
in a holding pattern because of bad weather said len nahmi a 
californiabased airline captain and air safety investigator 
it is common for aircraft to be in holding patterns with altitude 
separations of 1000 feet in weather that severely limits 
visibility nahmi said 
if a pilot deviated from an assigned altitude when information 
disappeared the controller would be unable to detect the change 
and a collision would be likely he said 
parrent acknowleged the glitches have made some controllers 
uneasy 
it does cause tense moments in the control room he said 
but we would not run that program if there was a derogation of 
safety

defense secretary frank c carlucci praised the 
japanese government for taking on a greater share of its own 
defense but urged it to contribute more toward western security 
speaking to the japan national press club on monday carlucci 
noted that japan has in this decade taken on defense of sealanes up 
to 1000 miles offshore and begun a fiveyear procurement plan of 
beefing up its forces 
he said japan had done away with its selfimposed limit of 
spending just 1 percent of its gross national product on defense and 
that the government had also pledged to pay all nonsalary 
allowances and expenses for japanese workers on us bases here by 
1990 
japan does more than it often gets credit for he said i 
want to make equally clear today that still more remains to be 
done 
carlucci urged japan to increase defense spending since the 
current program provides for what he called the minimum capability 
japan needs to fulfill the defense obligations it has assumed 
japan also should increase its financial support for maintaining 
us military personnel stationed here which costs the us 
government 3 billion annually he said 
carlucci also called on japan to boost overseas economic aid to 
such developing nations such as pakistan portugal turkey and 
afghanistan which he called nations in which aid could advance 
our overall security 
he said the west should strengthen controls on its exports to the 
east to keep its technological lead over the soviet bloc and should 
not be lulled by last weeks superpower summit in moscow 
until we see some tangible changes we should not change our 
policies he said we are still facing a serious military 
threat

at least 1000 demonstrators today blocked 
the government from wrecking buildings around the golden temple to 
create a security corridor free of hiding places for sikh militants 
authorities said 
the crowd gathered on a road and prevented construction vehicles 
from moving in to demolish the buildings within 30 yards of the 
holiest shrine of the sikh religion 
sikh militants have used the temple as a base in their battle for 
an independent homeland 
militants shot and killed a sikh couple at a village near 
amritsar on monday the united news of india said 
the killings raised to 1259 the number of people killed this 
year in attacks blamed on sikh radicals many of the victims have 
been members of the majority hindu community but the militants have 
also targeted moderate sikhs 
most of the demonstrators in amritsar were tenants of the 
affected buildings an amritsar district government official said 
the demonstrators were demanding that they be provided alternate 
housing before they were evicted said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said senior government officials were negotiating with the 
demonstrators the demolitions will not begin until the problem is 
resolved he said 
plans for the security corridor were launched after a 10day 
police siege of the temple ended on may 18 more than 200 militants 
surrendered to police during the siege that left 46 people dead 
including 41 suspected radicals and five civilians caught in 
crossfire 
police found it difficult to maintain a cordon around the shrine 
because the maze of alleys shops and houses next to the complex 
provided cover for radicals 
sarbjeet singh the top government officer in the district said 
workers would demolish 522 properties by the end of the year and 
create a corridor 17 miles in circumference 
the entire project scheduled to be completed within two years 
was expected to cost 115 million which would include expenses to 
buy the land and relocate families and businesses he said 
sikhs form 2 percent of indias 800 million people but are in a 
majority in northern punjab state where amritsar is 
sikh militants have been agitating since 1982 for an independent 
homeland in punjab they say they are discriminated against by 
hindus who comprise 80 percent of the countrys population

hashemi rafsanjani was reelected speaker 
of irans parliament today consolidating his hold on political and 
military power 
rafsanjanis reelection came five days after ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini named him commanderinchief of the armed forces in the 
wake of two major battlefield defeats in the war against iraq 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose 
credentials have been approved since elections in april and may 
voted for rafsanjani five abstained 
rafsanjani 53 has been speaker since 1980 
radicals including many rafsanjani supporters made sweeping 
gains in the elections at the expense of conservatives who have 
blocked economic reforms 
the credentials of other elected deputies in the 270seat majlis 
or parliament have either been passed to an investigating committee 
for scrutiny following objections from other deputies or have not 
yet been approved irna reported 
rafsanjani is also khomeinis representative on the supreme 
defense council which determines irans strategy in the 7year war 
with iraq he sits on the council for the expediency of state 
decrees formed earlier this year by khomeini to push radical 
economic reforms through parliament 
rafsanjani has strong links with the revolutionary guards corps 
which is now more powerful than the iranian army 
the 87yearold khomeini patriarch of irans islamic revolution 
has been reported in poor health speculation that his condition was 
deteriorating was heightened when he relinquished his constitutional 
position as commanderinchief to rafsanjani a middleranking 
cleric 
khomeini has designated a senior cleric ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri as his successor but many leading figures including 
rafsanjani oppose montazeri 
khomeinis appointment underlined that rafsanjani who has long 
been close to the patriarch retains his confidence and is being 
groomed to hold great power in the postkhomeini era 
the election was the most fiercely contested since the islamic 
revolution toppled the shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 1979 the gains 
in parliament by the radicals supported by khomeini prompted 
allegations by some prominent conservatives who failed to win 
reelection that the polling was rigged 
it sharpened divisions between radicals seeking a centralized 
staterun economy and the conservatives who are backed by the 
wealthy merchant class 
the elections touched off clashes between khomeini supporters 
backed by the revolutionary guards and protesters in several cities 
diplomatic sources reported several people were reported killed 
when the guards opened fire on demonstrators 
irans best known opposition politician former prime minister 
mehdi bazargan distributed an open letter last week accusing 
khomeini of erroneous policies in the war with iraq and making 
the islamic republic an object of hate around the world 
reports reaching paris said bazargans criticism triggered a wave 
of arrests but it was not known if bazargan himself had been 
detained 
bazargans small freedom movement is the only opposition faction 
permitted to function openly in iran and has been constantly 
harassed by khomeini militants in recent years

political discontent among beijing university 
students broke into the open today as students put up illegal 
posters demanding democracy and criticizing government corruption 
dozens of anonymous posters blanketed bulletin boards on campus 
and spilled onto nearby buildings some with large characters 
scrawled in black paint on sheets of newspaper and others written in 
tiny characters on notebook pages 
china faces an allout crisis said one poster the most 
basic human rights are imperiled 
several posters demanded a more open press complaining that 
chinese often learn about events in their own country through the 
foreign media one quoted the preamble to the us declaration of 
independence with its defense of life liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness 
students said they planned to march wednesday from campus to 
tiananmen square the symbolic center of power in beijing to 
dramatize their demands street marches are illegal without police 
permission 
a graduate student at beijing university slain last week in a 
brawl outside a liquor store on friday about 1000 students 
marched to tiananmen square and met with officials to demand 
improved security and the arrest of the killers police arrested six 
suspects within 48 hours of the killing 
since friday hundreds of students have gathered nightly around 
campus bulletin boards holding debates and encouraging each other 
to draw a larger lesson from the killing 
people are concerned about more than just this incident said 
one girl they want to do something for the living 
several times in recent months university students have put up 
posters criticizing government bureaucracy and demanding more state 
funds for education the new posters repeated those themes but also 
demanded democracy and freedom for the first time since 
prodemocracy protests swept china in the winter of 198687 
those protests in which thousands of students marched through 
beijing and other major cities led to a government crackdown on 
liberalism and the ouster of communist party chief hu yaobang for 
his alleged tolerance toward the students 
students since have been careful not to raise the themes of 
democracy and freedom 
a beijing university freshman said today that students are 
divided over whether agitation now will help or hurt the cause of 
democracy 
the 7th national peoples congress was the most democratic 
ever he said referring to the national legislative session held 
in march and april at which delegates were encouraged for the first 
time to debate selected issues 
we see democracy moving forward slowly but if conditions 
become upset the government will again rule with a firm hand he 
said perhaps the steps we take will not lead us to our goals 
perhaps just the opposite 
other students acknowledged that they lack the support of wider 
groups in society most urban workers are more concerned with the 11 
percent inflation rate than such abstract issues as democracy 
one poster urged the students to join in the planned march 
wednesday to propagate among the masses the necessity of democracy 
and rule of law 
another claimed a small breeze at beijing university can raise 
up a storm nationwide 
one poster accused the government of paying more attention to 
crushing student protests than stamping out official corruption 
even a dog that is wronged gives a few barks but we beijing 
university students arent even as good as a dog it taunted 
challeging students to speak out

a leading critic of house speaker jim wright 
said today he isnt sure wright was wrong in using an aide to help 
write a book but the speakers activities should be investigaged 
the aide was paid 2000 from official congressional accounts for 
expenses during a 1984 trip to texas to oversee final editing of a 
privately published book by wright house records show 
im not sure frankly whether we have a problem here or not 
with this particular case rep newt gingrich rga said on the 
cbs show this morning 
theres clearly a legitimate public policy role served in 
writing books gingrich said the question would come whether 
the primary job of that staffer was to write a book which was being 
written purely for profit or whether that was a natural part of his 
job doing something that reflected a public policy interest 
i think every member of congress has at times used their staff 
in a legitimate way to look at serious public policy pronouncements 
or serious efforts to influence public policy gingrich said 
but he reiterated previous calls for a house ethics committee 
investigation of wrights activities 
rep barney frank dmass also said wright should be 
investigated frank said he doesnt consider accusations against 
wright valid but feels that an investigation would help restore 
public confidence 
the book reflections of a public man published by a 
longtime fort worth friend of the speaker brought wright nearly 
55000 in royalties 
matthew cossolotto who has since left wrights staff said in a 
telephone interview monday that his texas trip was the culmination 
of several months of onandoff work in wrights capitol hill office 
to help the texas democrat draft the books manuscript 
house ethical guidelines allow wide latitude in the use of staff 
members but stipulate that employees may not be compensated from 
public funds to perform nonofficial personal or campaign activities 
on behalf of the member 
records maintained by the house show 207827 paid to cossolotto 
for hotel accommodations while on official business car rental 
and meals from oct 22 to nov 14 1984 when cossolotto said he was 
in fort worth to complete work on the book 
at the time wright was house majority leader the no 2 
leadership post 
cossolotto said he spent a good chunk of time perhaps 150 
to 200 hours between mid1984 when wright assigned him to work on 
the book at a staff meeting and his trip to fort worth the book is 
largely a compilation of wrights speeches sayings and anecdotes 
it was not full time in any particular week cossolotto said 
i would collect some things read some stuff talk to the majority 
leader it was hit and miss the big crunch was down in fort worth 
during the trip which was arranged by wrights office 
cossolotto said he worked with the publisher read proofs and made 
final corrections on the book he said he flew to fort worth on a 
commercial flight but did not know how that was paid for the house 
financial records for the period do not show any air fare attributed 
to cossolotto 
the book deal was among cases of alleged questionable activities 
by wright cited in requests for an investigation of wright by the 
house ethics committee the panel met last week without deciding how 
to proceed and is scheduled to resume consideration of the matter 
thursday 
in an interview with the washington post which first reported 
the aides work on the book monday cossolotto said he was a 
little uncomfortable with the assignment and did not know whether 
it was proper under house rules 
asked monday whether he reported that uneasiness to any of his 
superiors or sought assurances from them he answered thats 
sort of a touchy one im not sure if i did 
earlier news reports have pointed out that wright has collected 
nearly 55000 in royalties from the book receiving 325 for each 
copy of the slim 595 volume it was published by carlos moore a 
fort worth friend of wright who also was paid more than 250000 by 
wrights reelection committee in 1985 and 1986 while wright was 
collecting the royalties 
wrights office would not comment on the matter monday in an 
interview with the post however the speaker defended cossolottos 
assignment and said the amount of time the aide had spent was 
rather negligible 
if he gave some time to try to help put together a book that 
would demonstrate to the public my philosophy my basic beliefs 
that wouldnt be too far afield from the public business wright 
told the newspaper 
another wright staff member press aide george mair is 
collaborating with the speaker on a book looking at the history of 
congress over its first 200 years and in particular at those who 
have held the speakers office 
mair was hired by the speaker on a shortterm contract last dec 
1 and his 65000ayear contract was renewed in may 
one news account of the contract renewal said mair was kept on to 
help with a number of projects including the book but mair said 
monday he and wright are working on the book totally outside office 
hours

the israeliappointed mayor 
of the west bank town of elbireh was stabbed in the chest today in 
an apparent assassination attempt by palestinian militants 
the stabbing of hassan tawil in his 70s follows repeated 
demands by underground leaders of the 6monthold palestinian 
uprising that he and scores of other israeliappointed officials 
resign their jobs in the occupied west bank 
tawil was taken to nearby ramallah hospital where officials said 
he was in stable condition after surgery 
he was stabbed once with a very long knife that pierced his 
heart diaphragm liver and stomach said the officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
brig gen shaike erez head of the military government in the 
west bank said tawil was attacked near the city hall in elbireh a 
town of mostly moslems about nine miles north of jerusalem 
israel radio said a knife was found near the scene of the attack 
yusef taher one of four members of the elbireh city council 
blamed the attack on palestinian militants and said i had hoped 
we would not descend to the level of assassination 
the army set up roadblocks and imposed a curfew on elbireh 
confining the 10000 residents to their homes 
hussein tawil a son of the mayor said a driver who also acted 
as a guard was with his father at the time of the attack he said 
the man was being questioned by police 
three israeli soldiers guarded tawils room at ramallah hospital 
and prevented even family members from entering 
when hussein tawil appeared he said let me in i want to see 
my father but soldiers pushed him away 
two army jeeps were parked outside the hospital and about 20 
soldiers surrounded the building 
a spokesman for the us consulate in jerusalem condemned the 
attack 
israel army radio said it received an anonymous telephone call 
from a hebrewspeaking man who took responsibility for the stabbing 
but did not identify any group as having carried out the attack 
the radio quoted him as saying we are sick of the stone 
throwers thats why we did it implying the attackers were jewish 
extremists 
but both diplomatic sources and palestinian journalists 
discounted the call saying the attack was more likely the work of 
palestinian militants 
tawil was one of three mayors appointed by the israeli government 
in september 1986 as part of an effort to gain cooperation from 
palestinian moderates the palestinian mayors replaced israeli 
officials who had been running the municipalities 
the appointments immediately provoked opposition in the west 
bank where palestinian extremists often have threatened to 
assassinate those who cooperate with israels government 
in march 1986 mayor zafer elmasri of nablus was slain in front 
of his office three months after israel appointed him to govern the 
west banks largest city last october two palestine liberation 
organization members were sentenced to life in prison for the 
slaying 
todays attack follows repeated calls in underground leaflets for 
israelappointed mayors and city officials to resign such leaflets 
signed by the plobacked united leadership of the uprising have 
prompted the resignation of about 400 arab policemen 
according to army officials there are israeliappointed mayors 
in about a dozen towns and cities in the west bank heads of about 
85 village councils also are appointed by the military government 
meron benveniste an israeli expert on the west bank said 
attacks on such palestinian officials could be predicted once the 
uprising began to ebb 
it was clear that once the uprising would die down a bit 
they would start doing their accounting they told them to resign 
and they didnt want to he said 
on monday israeli troops opened fire at rioting arabs in the 
occupied gaza strip hours after richard shifter us assistant 
secretary of state for human rights toured the area with us 
ambassador thomas pickering a 9monthold palestinian child lost an 
eye in the shooting 
three other arabs were injured monday in protests in the strips 
jabaliya refugee camp in the west bank a 16yearold palestinian 
boy was wounded when troops chased stonethrowers 
also monday the army reopened high schools for 36000 students 
in the west bank and released more than 100 arab teenagers from 
jail so they could attend classes 
schools had been closed since february and israeli officials said 
their reopening indicates a waning of the antioccupation uprising 
in which 202 palestinians and two israelis have been killed 
west bank military government spokesman olivier rawofitz reported 
90 percent attendance that he said showed a wish to return to normal

a judge has ordered a 60woman 
bowling league reinstated at a country club that allegedly took away 
the leagues time slot because its members didnt spend enough on

any cabinetlevel federal official should 
resign if continuing in office harms the president or the 
presidency former president gerald ford said in response to a 
question about attorney general edwin meese iii 
ford in an appearance monday before the national press club was 
asked what advice he would give meese regarding resignation from 
office an independent counsel has been investigating 
conflictofinterest allegations regarding meeses financial 
dealings 
i strongly believe that when a person in the cabinet or in some 
comparable post in the federal government if he is challenged for 
alleged misdeeds if his staying in office in any way undercuts or 
jeopardizes the president or the presidency that individual should 
walk into the oval office and offer his resignation ford said 
he did not mention meese by name nor did he say meeses 
continuation in office undercuts or jeopardizes the president 
ford said in his speech that the deficitsaddled federal budget 
process is in total shambles and congress should restore power 
to the white house to straighten out the mess 
ford called for congress to reinstate the presidents power to 
impound appropriated money a device congress removed when it 
streamlined the budget process in 1974 
the antiimpoundment provisions in my opinion have been a 
disaster ford said the present system is no substitute for 
strong action by the president of the united states he said

underground leaders of the 6monthold 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories today 
called on arab leaders to open their borders to guerrilla attacks on 
israel 
the appeal carried by the palestinian news agency wafa was made 
to the arab chiefs of state who begin a threeday emergency summit 
meeting in algiers tonight 
the summit was to be devoted to solidifying support for the 
palestinian uprising among the 21 arab league members 
the underground leaders of the uprising which involves mainly 
palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza said all 
the arab nations surrounding israel should open their borders to 
palestinian combatants 
the appeal was directed mainly at lebanon jordan and syria the 
three nations represented at the summit that have a common border 
with israel all three fearing israeli reprisals have taken action 
to prevent guerrilla attacks on israel across their borders 
algeria prepared a spectacular welcome for king hassan ii of 
morocco who arrived on a luxury liner in the bay of algiers his 
visit marks the two north african arab neighbors reconciliation 
after 12 years of hostility 
algeria and morocco resumed diplomatic relations may 16 after 
deciding to put aside their dispute over the western sahara at 
least for now 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi arrived this afternoon escorted by 
female bodyguards and wearing a goldembroidered white kaftan a 
blackandwhite palestinian khafia in the colors of the palestine 
liberation organization was draped around his neck 
in a statement distributed by libyas official news agency jana 
on the eve of the summit gadhafi accused unidentified arab leaders 
of acting under specific instructions from the us state 
department 
the possibility of denouncing these leaders before the 
palestinian people and the arab nation will perhaps be the only 
positive point of this summit gadhafi declared 
president hafez assad of syria and president amin gemayel of 
lebanon were among the last to arrive plo chairman yasser arafat 
king hussein of jordan and king fahd of saudi arabia flew in monday 
the underground leaders exhorted the arab chiefs of state to 
allow palestinians living in the arab countries to take part in the 
struggle against the zionist enemy wafa said 
the uprisings leadership also demanded joint arab action to give 
international protection to the palestinian people and to 
demolish all suspect peace plans such as that of secretary of 
state george p shultz today he ended a fourday tour of the 
region to promote the plan 
an international peace conference with full representation of the 
plo remains the only way to a durable just and global peace 
the underground leaders declared 
the united states and israel officially regard the plo as a 
terrorist organization and seek to bar it from any role in the peace 
process 
plo spokesman bassam abu sharif said monday in algiers that the 
shultz plan was born dead 
he said the plo was not only demanding money to compensate for 
loss of income due to protest strikes in the west bank and gaza 
strip but other forms of support such as food shipments 
he said political support for the rioting should include a 
unified stand by the conferees rejecting the latest us peace 
initiative and reiterating their endorsement of the plo as the 
sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people inside 
and outside the occupied terroritories 
arab league officials and diplomats said the summit will also 
touch on other key problems facing the arab world such as the 
iraniraq war and the conflict in lebanon

a vatican commission today approved a miracle 
attributed to the intercession of mother katharine drexel clearing 
the way for her beatification by pope john paul ii a churchman said 
the rev paul molinari the postulator or presenter of 
mothers drexels cause said the miracle was approved unanimously 
by the congregation for the causes of saints 
the next step is for the pope to make the decision final and 
set a date for the beatification possibly in the fall he said in 
a telephone interview 
beatification is a step toward possible sainthood which would 
require confirmation of a second miracle attributed to her 
intercession 
mother drexel a member of a prominent philadelphia banking 
family founded the sisters of the blessed sacrament in 1891 to work 
among blacks and american indians she lived on less than a dollar a 
day but gave an estimated 20 million to further her orders work 
before her death in 1955 at age 96 
the miracle attributed to her involved the healing in 1974 of 
robert j gutherman who had lost hearing in his right ear from an 
infection he regained his hearing after his family and members of 
the order prayed for mother drexels intervention

a space shuttle crew made a mock 
emergency landing today to conclude a major countdown rehearsal held 
to test hundreds of launch changes that were made as a result of the 
challenger disaster 
following a successful practice countdown and liftoff the 
threeman astronaut crew in a shuttle flight simulator in houston 
had to make a tricky quick return to the kennedy space center 
runway here when one of three main engines failed more than two 
minutes into the flight 
the rehearsal for the nations first shuttle mission in 2 years 
put the launch team here through the final three hours of the count 
in a realistic preparation for the actual launch of discovery 
scheduled aug 31 it was the most comprehensive test of its kind 
since challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch killing the seven 
crew members on jan 28 1986 
the makebelieve emergency landing gave the astronauts and 
mission control center in houston vital experience in making 
splitsecond decisions to make it safely back to the runway here 
the astronauts had to fly the simulator to an altitude of about 
75 miles and about 400 miles east of here while fuel was exhausted 
then with a second engine locked up and useless the astronauts 
pitched around went through the motions of jettisoning their huge 
external fuel tank into the atlantic ocean and battling hydraulic 
and other difficulties glided to a mock touchdown on the 
15000foot shuttle runway three miles from the launch pad landing 
occurred 21 minutes after the engine failed 
executing the maneuvers in the simulator were astronauts loren 
shriver james wetherbee and franklin changdiaz observing were 
commander rick hauck and the four members of his crew who will fly 
the discovery mission in august 
the simulated liftoff was 55 minutes late because of intentional 
electrical communications and other problems built into the count 
to give controllers experience in resolving them a high fuel 
pressure reading 31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a 
real launch effort but was bypassed so the test could continue 
the exercise involved 300 launchday team members from five nasa 
field centers contractor personnel and rescue weather safety and 
communications officials nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said the 
purpose was to validate to the fullest extent possible the 
complete launch process system 
there have been hundreds of changes most aimed at safety in 
procedures personnel flight and ground hardware software and 
management since the challenger accident todays simulation was the 
only opportunity to check them out with the entire launchday team 
before the actual countdown 
under the new management structure astronaut bob crippen 
veteran of four shuttle flights has the final decision on whether a 
shuttle will be launched his main adviser is launch director bob 
sieck but either can call on scores of experts in many disciplines 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since the challenger 
disaster with the major roadblock to flight being the redesign of 
the solid fuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion 
discovery is in a hangar here undergoing final checks following 
an overhaul of its main engine and other systems on june 16 it is 
to be moved into an assembly building for mating with its two 
booster rockets and external fuel tank transfer to the launch pad 
is planned for june 27 
the spaceships three main engines will be testfired on the pad 
in a critical test on july 19 
space agency officials said the aug 31 launch target can be met 
if no critical problems crop up during testing here and at the 
morton thiokol plant in utah where two more fullscale tests are 
planned of the redesigned booster rocket the utah tests are slated 
for june 14 and july 26 
when discovery is launched it will carry a crew of five veteran 
shuttle astronauts who will deploy a tracking and data relay 
satellite and conduct experiments during four days in space

a latin american effort to negotiate a 
settlement to the political crisis in panama got off to an 
unpromising start last week when military leader manuel antonio 
noriega showed no inclination to surrender power according a senior 
administration official 
the official insisting on anonymity said noriega showed an 
unwillngness to compromise and no give in his meeting with former 
presidents caros andres perez of venezuela and daniel oduber of 
costa rica 
the meeting was held a week after a us negotiating effort 
collapsed when noriega unexpectedly rejected a package deal at the 
last minute that would have required him to resign his post as 
defense force commander in august and temporarily leave the country 
in an interview monday assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams said perez who is seeking another term as venezuelan 
president in elections in december is expected to report on his 
panama initiative to secretary of state george p shultz later this 
month abrams refused comment on noriegas meeting with the two 
presidents 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked today if the united 
states planned to lift its economic sanctions against panama said 
there has been no change in our policy we are proceeding on the 
same course and dont anticipate any change at this point 
meanwhile two state department envoys were dispatched to panama 
last week to assess the situation but no meetings were held with 
noriega or other government officials 
abrams said morton abramowitz head of the bureau of intelligence 
and research explored the possibility of new us options for 
dealing with panama in the wake of the failed negotiating effort 
paul taylor a deputy assistant secretary who accompanied 
abramowitz examined the us sanctions against panama and concluded 
that the economic pressures on panama are very great abrams 
said 
among other measures the administration has frozen panamanian 
assets in the united states and is withholding payments to panama 
for services related to the operation of the panama canal 
a separate latin american initiative on panama involves an offer 
by guatemalan president vinicio cerezo for his country to be used as 
a site for negotiations between noriega and his political opponents 
abrams appeared to hold out little hope that any latin american 
negotiation could reach a settlement that would meet the us goal 
of restoring democracy in panama 
abrams noted that the deal us negotiators had worked out was 
opposed by an overwhelming majority in the senate and by vice 
president george bush the objections were based largely on the 
administration offer to drop federal drug smuggling indictments 
against noriega as part of the package deal 
abrams expressed doubt that the latin negotiators would be able 
get a better deal than the one noriega rejected because they lack 
leverage 
the latins dont have as much clout as we do because they cant 
play with the indictments or the sanctions abrams said how are 
they going to get a better deal if they get a worse deal how is 
that going to be acceptable to the american people 
so the latin role is both promising and potentially quite 
difficult

while environmentalists waited for a judge to 
consider their request to stop the navy from generating intense 
electromagnetic pulses off the atlantic coast the pentagon 
announced today that the tests had begun 
the tests according to the navy are intended to measure the 
ability of naval equipment to withstand radiation following a 
nuclear blast 
the pentagon said the empress ii barge had reached the test site 
off the virginianorth carolina coast monday afternoon and began the 
monthlong experiment by transmitting three microsecond bursts of 
electrical energy at around 4 pm 
at about 8 am this morning the generator began the second day 
of tests said lt karen kent a navy spokeswoman in washington 
the tests she said were being monitored by sophisticated measuring 
devices onshore 15 miles away 
the effect of the transmissions at those sites would be the 
same as sitting inside a car and transmitting on a cb radio for one 
second she said 
the foundation on economic trends a washingtonbased 
environmental group asked the us appeals court for the district 
of columbia on monday to halt the project 
right now our attorneys are at the courthouse trying to get the 
judge to set a time for a hearing on our request for an injunction 
while we appeal the last court ruling said jeremy rifkin 
director of the foundation 
the barge empress ii is designed to simulate the electromagnetic 
radiation that would follow the detonation of a nuclear weapon 
outside the earths atmosphere the tests are intended to determine 
the ability of navy ships aircraft and weapons to withstand the 
pulses 
empress ii or electromagnetic pulse radiation environment 
simulator for ships second generation can generate pulses of up to 
7 million volts 
environmentalists have expressed concern the surges will disrupt 
the marine environment within the test area and might affect 
computers and other delicate equipment outside it 
we just do not believe the navy has taken a hard look at these 
possible consequences at this particular site said andrew 
kimbrell an attorney for the foundation 
the foundation filed a lawsuit in 1987 and reached agreement with 
the navy last month that an environmental impact statement was 
needed before testing could begin 
the foundations interpretation of the agreement was that the 
navy would submit an environmental impact statement on the site it 
chose for testing which could take up to two years 
the navys interpretation was that it would submit an impact 
statement but that the study would not necessarily involve a 
specific site the navy submitted a statement previously drawn up 
for a chesapeake bay site 
a federal judge ruled friday that the navys interpretation was 
plausible and allowed the tests to proceed several calls today to 
the pentagon seeking to find out the time for the tests were not 
returned 
the navy insists that no dangers to the environment have been 
found in 20 years of similar testing and exhaustive studies

the son of retiring rep delbert latta has 
conceded defeat in a close republican primary race for the 
congressional seat the elder latta has held since 1958 
robert latta said in an interview monday that he will not pursue 
his right to have the validity of a number of ballots from the may 3 
primary decided by the ohio supreme court leaving state senate 
president paul gillmor the gop nominee by just 27 votes 
this decision will mean that the republican nominee for 
congress from the 5th district will have been nominated by a margin 
of 27 votes the narrowest margin ever recorded in an ohio 
congressional race notwithstanding the narrow margin i 
congratulate the winner said latta 32 a bowling green attorney 
an official recount of the may 3 primary ballots in the 13county 
northwest ohio district gave gillmor 28694 votes to 28667 for 
latta a third candidate rex damschroder of fremont received 5769 
votes 
the closest election suffered by the elder latta a member of the 
house budget and rules committees was 55 percent in 1982 he 
rebounded to 63 percent in 1984 and did as well in 1986 
the congressmans son said friday there was some concern over 
several disputed ballots on monday he declined to disclose how 
many ballots were in question 
but one republican official who spoke on the condition his name 
not be used said there were fewer than 27 disputed ballots and 
suggested that might have been a factor in lattas decision against 
a legal challenge 
gillmor 49 of port clinton said monday he was glad the primary 
was finally over 
this has been the longest election night i have ever been in

the united states is pressing reluctant greek 
officials to permit extradition of a palestinian suspected of 
involvement in the bombings of a pan am jumbo jet in 1982 and of a 
twa airliner in 1986 us officials say 
greek officials told the united states they did not think the 
evidence against mohammed rashid was sufficient and asked for 
additional information to justify extradition proceedings a us 
official said monday speaking only on condition of anonymity 
he said rashid was arrested in greece at the request of the 
united states 
in athens today government spokesman telemachos hitiris refused 
to comment directly saying only greece always cooperates for the 
eradication of terrorism and is dedicated to the struggle against 
it it imposes the strictest possible penalties against terrorists 
according to greek law 
a report about rashids arrest and us annoyance over greeces 
hesitancy to extradite him appeared monday in eleftherotypia a 
leftwing greek daily newspaper the paper said rashid was seized 
thursday at athens airport on a tip from an official in the us 
embassy 
a police source said yesterday sunday that there are no 
charges against rashid except maybe the use of a forged passport 
eleftherotypia wrote 
us intelligence information on rashid indicates he was involved 
in a 1986 blast aboard a trans world airlines airliner over greece 
in which four people including a baby were killed the us 
official said 
rashid also is suspected of playing a role in planting the bomb 
that exploded as a pan american airways jet was heading toward 
honolulu in august 1982 on a flight from tokyo a japanese teenager 
was killed and 15 people were injured none seriously 
a second source told the associated press greece has not yet made 
a decision on the extradition request 
the first official said ambassador l paul bremer the state 
departments top antiterrorism official flew to athens last week 
to press the greek government to permit the extradition of rashid to 
the united states 
robert keeley the us ambassador to greece also asked for 
rashids extradition during a meeting last thursday with greek 
premier andreas papandreou said a third source also speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the extradition request comes at a sensitive time in usgreek 
relations the two countries are negotiating the extension of the 
leases on four american bases in greece the leases expire dec 31 
papandreou under pressure from leftist groups is seeking to 
negotiate favorable terms for extending the leases including an 
increase in us aid 
the socialist leader is also on good terms with the palestine 
liberation organization and earlier this year he met in athens with 
plo chief yasser arafat greek newspapers reported at the time that 
arafat had promised papandreou to refrain from terror attacks on 
greek soil 
us officials have in the past accused greece of being lax on 
terrorism relations with athens were strained in 1984 after greece 
freed a suspected jordanian hijacker who reportedly was arrested on 
the basis of us intelligence information

drug experiments on more than 200 pregnant women 
were known to the president of the cook county board but he did not 
tell other commissioners according to the director of the county 
hospital 
two doctors gave dilantin a drug commonly used to treat 
epilepsy to about 245 pregnant women to determine whether the drug 
reduced fetal stress during caesareansection births hospital 
director terrence hansen said 
but only five of the women had consented to participate in the 
hospitalapproved study that began in september 1987 he said 
hansen and other hospital officials met with the board which 
acts as trustees for the hospital behind closed doors for nearly 
two hours monday to discuss the case against the two 
anesthesiologists 
several board members said they were angry and shocked when they 
heard the disclosure the boards president george dunne said he 
didnt recall being told 
he said the board would take no immediate action and would wait 
for the hospital medical staffs executive committee to finish its 
investigation a process required under medical staff bylaws 
hansen said dunne was told about the experiments in january when 
hospital medical director dr agnes lattimer ordered a halt to the 
study 
we told president dunne and he advised us to follow due process 
according to the hospitals bylaws hansen said 
dunne said i dont recall that conversation 
commissioner samuel vaughan head of the health and hospitals 
committee which oversees county oak forest and cermak hospitals 
said doctors should know that you dont conduct experiments on 
patients without getting their consent 
hansen said the doctors study called for giving the drug to no 
more than 50 pregnant patients who were candidates for 
caesareansection deliveries 
the great majority of the 245 patients given the drug were 
pregnant hansen said adding that he knew at least one patient 
who was not 
he said he was not sure why nonpregnant women would have been 
given dilantin 
several past studies have reported higher incidences of birth 
defects including heart abnormalities and retardation in babies 
born to women who regularly used dilantin and other drugs used to 
combat epileptic seizures 
hansen has noted however that the women at cook county hospital 
were given a single dose of between 500 and 700 milligrams 
substantially lower than a normal dose at or near the time 
they delivered 
ms lattimer said she was convinced the pregnant women who had 
been given the drug without their consent suffered no adverse 
effects 
that does not mean it is not a serious infraction and should 
not be prevented from happening again she said the physicians 
involved in this study violated hospital regulations

the united states britain and west germany have 
initiated direct contacts with the iranians in an effort to free 
foreign hostages in lebanon the times of london reported today 
in a frontpage story the conservative daily quoted shiite and 
sunni moslem sources in beirut as saying the united states opened 
talks with iranian officials almost two months ago in the hope of 
finding a legal formula to secure the release of the american 
hostages 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
he was not aware of any such contacts and said he had not seen the 
times story 
as you know were always talking to people at various levels 
about the hostage situation he said these stories come up 
frequently and usually arent correct and i dont think this one is 
either 
asked if president reagan would be bothered by having his term 
end without the liberation of the american hostages in lebanon 
fitzwater said well hell be very disappointed of course the 
hostage situation has been one of enormous concern and frustration 
to the president 
times correspondent robert fisk writing from west beirut said 
separate contacts by the three countries with the iranians are all 
reported to have taken place in europe 
so widely are the reports now believed in beirut that the 
american embassy here has been approached by several organizations 
representing kidnapped lebanese in the hope that washington might 
include other hostages in its bargaining with tehran fisk said 
eighteen foreigners are missing in lebanon including nine 
americans three britons and one west german terry anderson 40 
the chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 is the longestheld hostage 
the shiite and sunni sources were quoted as saying that legal 
methods of freeing the hostages would involve the paying of 
compensation to iran and the release of iranian assets which were 
frozen after the 1979 revolution that overthrew shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi 
iran has repeatedly demanded that the united states deliver large 
quantities of american weapons and armor paid for by the shah the 
paper said 
what has emerged only too clearly in west beirut is that iran 
controls all the foreign hostages still alive here and that even 
incidents like the kuwait airlines hijacking ultimately have their 
roots in tehran fisk said 
this is why the increasing reports here of contacts between 
london washington bonn and tehran are met with so little 
incredulity he said 
fisk reported new details on several hostagetakings 
for example he said terry waite the archbishop of canterburys 
special envoy is now believed to have been detained in january 1987 
by relatives of mohammed ali hamadi who was arrested in west 
germany four days earlier and is a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of 
a twa jet waite went to beirut to meet with the kidnappers of 
anderson and another american 
fisk quoted sources close to the shiite moslem amal militia as 
saying lt col william r higgins the american officer who 
commanded a united nations observer group and was kidnapped in south 
lebanon in february was targeted for abduction by the iranian 
embassy in beirut

movie the last emperor which was to have opened this month 
will be delayed until august an official said tuesday 
the spokesman for the film bureau which must approve all foreign 
films shown in china said italian director bernardo bertoluccis 
epic was still being dubbed into chinese 
reports in april said the film would open in a matter of weeks

which captured nine oscars including best picture and best 
director had run into conservative opposition and would be censored 
by chinese officials 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity denied that 
the movie was cut by censors in thailand japan and taiwan 
criticisms of the last emperor have appeared in the official 
press including charges that it had taken too many liberties with 
historical facts and leaned too much toward vulgarity in order to 
please moviegoers 
the movie depicts the life of the last chinese ruler pu yi from 
child emperor to puppet ruler under the japanese to prisoner of 
the communists and finally a gardener in china 
during the annual session of chinas legislature in april 
delegates charged that favoritism was shown toward the foreign movie 
crew which was allowed to shoot interior scenes in the imperial 
palace in violation of chinese law

fierce fighting broke out at a seoul 
university tuesday when masked students attacked riot police with 
rocks and firebombs and shouted antigovernment and antius 
slogans 
student leaders at other universities organized peaceful rallies 
and vowed to march to the border with north korea in an attempt to 
force reunification of the north and south 
down with the military dictatorship and yankee go home 
students at soongshil university yelled as they dashed out to hurl 
firebombs that exploded in flames around police in front of the 
school 
the violence erupted during mourning for a student from the 
university who died monday after setting himself afire during an 
antigovernment protest 
police fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas but were forced back 
several times by groups of protesters who barricaded a road with two 
basketball backboards and wielded clubs under cover of firebombs and 
rocks flying from the rooftop of a school building 
the fighting involved about 1000 students and continued for 
several hours often carrying into nearby alleys as students chased 
squadrons of police huddling behind shields 
both students and policemen were seen being hit by rocks and 
other missiles but police had no overall injury figures 
the front of the campus was draped in black mourning banners as 
students inside the school stood watch over the coffin of park 
raechun park was the third student to commit suicide in a month 
violent clashes erupted at several provincial campuses but 
students held peaceful rallies at many other schools across the 
country to prepare for a planned march friday to the border truce 
village of panmunjom 
despite repeated government warnings radical student leaders vow 
to go ahead with their march to the border to force unification of 
the peninsula divided in 1945 into communist north korea and 
prowestern south korea 
drive out yankees who forced the partition of our land a 
speaker shouted at a campus rally 
police vowed to arrest all students marching to the heavily 
militarized border opposition parties also opposed the march 
urging students to leave contacts with the north to official 
channels 
the protesters contend that the presence of 42000 us troops in 
south korea based here under a mutual defense pact hinders 
reunification of the two koreas 
us defense secretary frank carlucci said tuesday that us 
troops would stay in south korea as long as the korean people want 
us to stay 
the threat from the north has not abated and the north koreans 
continue to modernize their armed forces and deploy them forward in 
a threatening manner carlucci said after arriving in seoul 
carlucci and many other american officers are here for annual 
ussouth korean security consultations which will include us 
security help to ensure a successful olympics the games begin sept 
19 in seoul

the white house aids commission opened debate 
today on its chairmans 579 proposed recommendations amid 
indications there will be a lot of talk but little real controversy 
over most of them 
there is no controversy in the first 11 chapters william b 
walsh told fellow commissioners 
those chapters contain all of the recommendations except those 
calling for granting the surgeon general sweeping powers to deal 
with the epidemic 
walsh made clear to the panel chairman retired navy adm james 
d watkins that he does not agree with his recommendations for 
essentially turning the aids fight over to surgeon general c 
everett koop 
watkins said he was determined that the commission make some 
recommendation to president reagan on the best way to structure the 
federal health bureaucracy to deal with aids 
it is not well done today said watkins 
government bureaucracies usually work except when they have to 
move quickly in emergencies said watkins a former member of the 
joint chiefs of staff and aids he said is a national health 
emergency 
while saying he was not necessarily determined to stick to his 
recommendation that the surgeon general head the fight watkins said 
the commission has a responsibility to reach a consensus because 
were in the best position to do it 
a cornerstone of the recommendations watkins made last thursday 
was a call for federal legislation to protect from discrimination 
people who have the aids virus 
although somewhat controversial because it runs counter to the 
reagan administrations stated position there was clear consensus 
on the commission to retain that in the final report due at the 
white house june 24 
walsh expressed slight reservation about whether congress should 
be getting into that area but made clear that he favors some kind 
of antidiscrimination protection 
if were going to make it we should expand it to cover not 
just aids but all diseases he said 
after brief opening remarks the commission began a pagebypage 
discussion of the 269page report 
it plans at least two more days of meetings next thursday and 
friday to vote on the final version running into the weekend if 
necessary to complete deliberations

the fact that other people will have the pieces will just spread the 
blessing around

congressional efforts to make the omnibus trade 
bill law over president reagans veto are doomed unless sponsors can 
switch a handful of votes before wednesdays showdown on the senate 
floor leaders said tuesday 
i hope enough senators will change their minds tomorrow and 
override the presidents veto senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva told reporters 
byrd said he could not change the votes and could only hope that 
lastminute homestate pressure would cause three senators to relent 
and provide the twothirds margin needed to override reagans veto 
of the 1000page bill designed to strengthen the us position in 
the international marketplace 
centerpiece provisions would overhaul the system under which the 
government imposes import curbs as a means of aiding us industries 
and punishing international trade violations by other countries 
a wide array of other provisions range from hefty agricultural 
subsidies to repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oilindustry 
earnings 
the president vetoed the bill may 24 focusing heavily on 
opposition to a provision that would require companies with 100 
employees or more to provide notice to their workers of impending 
plant closings and largescale layoffs 
in short order the house voted 308113 to override the veto and 
approve the bill but supporters of the measure have found the 
senate tougher going 
were winning senate minority leader bob dole rkan a 
critic of the measure told reporters weve got 36 votes 
even if one senator democrat joseph biden of delaware were not 
at home recuperating from surgery opponents would be able to put an 
override out of reach if they could muster 34 votes in the 
100member senate 
the administration has said it wants a more moderate version of 
the trade bill once the senate sustains the veto 
there has been cloakroom talk that some senators looking at their 
reelection campaigns feel more comfortable about supporting the 
veto if they are assured that there will be another chance to vote 
on the trade issue before congress adjourns in october 
but it remains uncertain whether there will be such a second 
bill byrd has repeatedly raised the possibility that a raft of 
potential amendments that already have been taken care of over the 
last three years would reappear and stall the measure amid lengthy 
debate 
there will have to be some agreement between the ledership and 
the committee to hold off amendments dole said he said there was 
scant precedent for such a procedure 
failure to approve a trade bill would be an issue in fall 
campaigns but i dont think an overriding issue dole said 
byrd said reagan made a serious mistake on this veto because 
in disregarding the appeal of the plantclosings provision the 
president has written off an issue that involves decency and right 
the president was poorly advised on it byrd said

national convention floor to fight over the platform on south africa 
if dukakis did not alter his position to meet jacksons jackson has 
pressed dukakis to say he was willing to brand south africa a 
terrorist state

commitment on issues relating to south africa steinberg said

tawana brawleys mother will seek asylum in a 
black church rather than submit to arrest for her refusal to testify 
before a grand jury investigating her daughters disappearance her 
attorneys said today 
glenda brawley will not be appearing before a dutchess county 
grand jury tomorrow her attorney alton maddox jr told 
reporters glenda brawley will be seeking relief before a higher 
authority she will be putting her life in gods hands 
mrs brawley was sentenced to 30 days in jail monday for defying 
a grand jury subpoena to testify in the case but state attorney 
general robert abrams urged authorities to give her one more chance 
to explain her refusal to cooperate to a judge on wednesday 
brawleys family has claimed investigators and state officials 
are engaged in a racially motivated coverup mrs brawley 33 was 
not in the dutchess county courtroom when state supreme court 
justice angelo ingrassia sentenced her to jail and fined her 250 
maddox was flanked by attorney c vernon mason and the rev al 
sharpton as he spoke to reporters on the steps of queens state 
supreme court where they attended a hearing in connection with 
demonstrations they led in new york city last winter 
the three men refused to say what church would offer mrs brawley 
asylum but they insisted that the government does not have the 
right to violate the sanctuary of a church to arrest her for 
contempt of a grand jury 
abrams said monday that unless the family of tawana brawley 
starts cooperating soon well have to start winding down the 
investigation 
the grand jury will hold its next session wednesday 
tawana brawley 16 was found nov 28 lying in a plastic bag in 
wappingers falls about 10 miles north of here and 95 miles north of 
new york city her hair was cut animal excrement was smeared on her 
and racial epithets were scrawled on her body she said she had been 
attacked by six white men including one who flashed a policelike 
badge 
in one of several testy exchanges monday with judge angelo 
ingrassia maddox said the hearing was a futile exercise and 
that mrs brawley would not get justice in a system that has been 
opressing blacks for hundreds of years 
ingrassia said that since the only reasons for the refusal to 
testify were political he had no choice but to hold her in contempt 
about an hour before the judges order mrs brawley left the 
courthouse with the rev al sharpton a family adviser and nation 
of islam leader louis farrakhan she did not appear in the courtroom 
following the proceedings maddox and roughly 300 supporters who 
came by bus from new york city marched down a street they were 
surrounded by a dozen bodyguards with linked arms and did not 
respond to reporters questions 
during the hearing brawley attorneys twice asked ingrassia to 
disqualify himself saying he had a connection to gov mario cuomo 
and that he had not taken a leadership role in preventing news leaks 
about the investigation 
ingrassia said he never met cuomo and refused to disqualify 
himself 
brawley attorneys had sought to subpoena several officials 
including cuomo but ingrassia rejected the requests

democrat michael dukakis poised to lock up his partys 
presidential nomination said he would start considering running 
mates on wednesday providing today is a good day in the final 
four primaries 
the night before dukakis exulted that victory is in the air 
while remaining rival jesse jackson looked back with pride calling 
his historic candidacy a catalyst for growth 
republican george bush who has the gop nomination in the bag 
expressed eagerness to face dukakis in the fall he said the two 
have many differences and i am on the right side 
today in an interview with abctv bush tried to deflect an 
issue he is sure to face throughout the campaign his involvement 
or noninvolvement in the irancontra affair by questioning 
whether us arms were sent to iran in exchange for hostages 
freedom after all 
im not sure they were released for anything to do with arms 
for hostages he said pressed as to why three us citizens were 
released from captivity in lebanon bush said totally because of 
that no there was some inclination on the part of the 
hostageholders that they thought they might get something in 
return its not all that clear 
dukakis said today there may well be a floor fight or two 
with jackson and his supporters at the democratic national 
convention next month but he added i dont see any great 
divisions within our party 
he said the united states must go far beyond our current 
sanctions against south africa but he stopped short of calling 
south africa a terrorist nation a label demanded of dukakis and the 
party by jackson 
dukakis said he and jackson talked in general terms of jacksons 
postprimary role in the party during a meeting late monday night 
but he would not give details he said the vice presidency was not 
discussed 
jackson said today the two had discussed south africa and other 
issues such as jacksons complaints about delegate selection 
hes sensitive on these matters and were going to have some 
followup meetings necessarily to discuss matters of platform 
credentials rules the convention itself and beyond that our 
strategy for winning in november jackson told reporters 
the fourmonth presidential primary season closed today with 
races in california new jersey new mexico and montana all three 
presidential contenders were in california today and all were 
staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the days 
contests 
early turnout was reported light in new jersey and moderate in 
new mexico 
the biggest prize is california and an abc news tracking poll 
indicated dukakis led jackson in the state by a 21 margin 61 
percent to 30 percent the survey based on 415 interviews saturday 
and sunday had a margin of error of 6 percentage points the 
network reported monday night 
california officials were predicting a low turnout however 
secretary of state march fong eu said she expected a turnout of 48 
percent which would be the lowest in more than 40 years 
before todays voting began dukakis had nearly 1900 delegates 
leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2081 needed to nominate on 
monday alone more than 70 delegates flocked to the dukakis camp 
jackson trails with less than 1000 delegates 
there were 466 delegates at stake in todays primaries 
in addition dukakis former rivals for the nomination were 
lining up behind him campaign sources said dukakis would travel to 
missouri on wednesday the day after the last primaries to pick up 
rep richard gephardts endorsement the same day the sources said 
sen paul simon of illinois was to endorse the massachusetts 
governor in washington 
dukakis not noted for his effusiveness nonetheless sounded like 
a happy man as he headed into the final contests 
im really overwhelmed by the good feeling the spirit the 
confidence a sense of victory is in the air he said as he 
campaigned monday in los angeles 
jackson however suffered a primaryeve embarrassment when he 
missed the first 16 minutes of a live halfhour statewide broadcast 
that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform 
for a dramatic final appeal 
jackson told the new york times in an interview published today 
that he had earned the option to be offered the vice 
presidential spot he had said previously he deserved consideration 
for the post 
in recent weeks jackson has been looking ahead to the convention 
and pressing his platform demands but he has also been looking back 
at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black 
candidate jackson said his candidacy has helped build racial 
tolerance 
its clear america has become more and more accustomed to jesse 
jackson as a possible next president he said monday its a 
matter of growth im the stimulus im the catalyst for that 
growth 
bush meanwhile got a primaryeve boost of sorts from the reagan 
administration interior secretary donald hodel announced monday 
night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oildrilling 
project off the california coast 
earlier this week in what was then a step away from the 
administration the vice president called for a delay in the 
project the two democrats oppose it outright and dukakis had 
faulted bush for failing to do likewise 
bush speaking to a republican audience on monday said he 
cant wait for this primary season to end so he can go 
headtohead with dukakis 
for bush the primary season has been over for some time he 
clinched the 1139 delegates he needed for the gop nomination back 
in april but the republican competition effectively ended three 
months ago when the vice president racked up landslide wins across 
the south

justice minister annagreta leijon 
resigned tuesday over a secret investigation she authorized in the 
olof palme murder case averting a confidence vote that threatened 
to bring down the government 
mrs leijon 49 was the highestranking woman in swedish 
politics and a ranking figure in the social democratic party 
critics accused her of overstepping her authority by approving the 
secret probe of prime minister palmes assassination which has 
stumped police 
palme was shot to death on a downtown street the night of feb 
28 1986 while walking home from a movie with his wife the killer 
has not been found and no motive has been established 
sweden has offered a reward of 50 million kronor 84 million 
for information leading to the killer 
the resignation forestalled a noconfidence motion in parliament 
that ingvar carlsson palmes successor appeared certain to lose 
it was an embarrassing setback for the social democrats who lead a 
minority government three months before general elections 
a majority in the riksdag parliament has decided that i 
should resign and that leaves me no option mrs leijon told a 
news conference 
she authorized a friend to look into allegations that iran 
ordered the killing because palme had stopped illegal swedish arms 
sales to iran 
bypassing official investigators she arranged for publisher ebbe 
carlsson to reopen the probe of the alleged iranian connection he 
is not related to the current prime minister 
no results of his efforts have been disclosed 
press reports say his investigation began in april a letter 
written by mrs leijon for carlsson to carry to britain was dated 
in may 
police had spent a year looking into the alleged iranian 
connection and the possibility that kurdish exiles were involved 
hans holmer a close friend of the publisher was fired as police 
commissioner when he refused to give up on the theory 
the outcry about the unofficial project increased after 
disclosures of irregularities including that the publishers 
bodyguard smuggled forbidden eavesdropping equipment into sweden 
the secret operation was financed by a contribution of 2 million 
kronor 343000 from a banker 
prime minister carlsson said he will give mrs leijon a prominent 
post in the next cabinet if his party wins the september elections 
shes been a great minister one of the best but she has made 
one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that he said 
she is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left 
to do in politics he appointed industry minister thage g 
peterson to act as justice minister until the election 
mrs leijon was forced to quit when the small communist party 
which normally supports carlssons minority government decided 
monday it would join the opposition in a noconfidence vote 
center party leader olof johannson said she hasnt followed 
the rules of the game in our democracy thats why she had to go 
its clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the 
constitution 
she was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since 
the social democrats took office in 1982 
sten wickbom quit in october after a convicted spy escaped while 
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison in 1983 ove rainer 
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes 
mrs leijon was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer 
by training and the first woman to hold the job she favored 
tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against 
terrorism

religious dissidents demanded tuesday that russian 
orthodox church leaders renounce the churchs adulation of josef v 
stalin who brutally repressed believers during his rule 
its the responsibility of the church to announce which side it 
is on the side of perestroika or the side of stalinism father 
gleb yakunin told reporters in a moscow apartment 
a person cannot be renewed in his personal life unless he 
repents this is true of the church too he said 
yakunin and other religious activists met with reporters on the 
second day of the russian orthodox church local council in zagorsk 
northeast of moscow the council is at the center of celebrations of 
the faiths 1000th anniversary 
soviet society is reevaluating stalins role in history and 
soviets from communist party chief mikhail s gorbachev on down have 
sharply criticized the purges in which millions of people were 
killed or exiled 
the church has kept silent and dissidents demanded that the 
hierarchy join in the criticism of stalin 
almost 100 believers from around the soviet union crowded in a 
few small rooms in a moscow apartment for the beginning of an 
unofficial threeday seminar on religious problems in the soviet 
union 
yakunin and other church activists released copies of an appeal 
they sent to patriarch pimen the russian orthodox church leader 
asking that the church council condemn a 1949 letter the council 
sent to stalin for his 70th birthday basically canonizing the 
dictator 
the church wrote stalin that it was forever grateful to you for 
your attentiveness to its needs 
yakunin several months ago called on the ailing 77yearold pimen 
to resign to allow a younger more energetic church leader to take 
advantage of gorbachevs reforms 
yakunin was barred from performing religious rites from 1966 
until last year because of his criticism of church officials and he 
is a former political prisoner in august the church gave him a 
small parish near moscow 
thousands of priests were exiled or killed during repression 
following the bolshevik revolution in 1917 after stalin took power 
a law was passed in 1929 sharply restricting church activities the 
church faced its severest repression in the 1930s 
the dissidents criticized the selection of delegates for the 
church council in zagorsk and the amount of money being spent on the 
millennium celebration 
ceremonies scheduled at moscows bolshoi theater threaten to turn 
the event in a pompous theatrical action yakunin said 
each day of the weeklong celebration costs about 16 million he 
said 
another dissident priest georgy edelshtein of kostroma 
northeast of moscow said representatives to the council were chosen 
by bishops rather than by meetings of lay people priests and 
deacons 
dissidents said priests and believers were kept in the dark about 
the selection of nine candidates for sainthood 
in rome a vatican source said vatican secretary of state 
agostino casaroli who arrives wednesday as pope john paul iis 
representative at millennium celebrations will carry a letter from 
the polishborn pontiff to gorbachev 
there was no information on whether john pauls message to 
gorbachev would touch on the situation of the ukrainian catholic 
church which is not officially recognized but operates underground 
in the western ukraine 
the russian orthodox church is opposed to official recognition of 
the ukrainian catholic church 
a top church official said saturday that recognition of it would 
hurt improving relations between rome and the russian orthodox 
church but that the two sides would discuss the issue in finland 
later this month 
a priest of the underground church yevgeny genrikhs told the 
news conference that the russian church has no right to help decide 
the issue 
if this is the price the russian orthodox church is willing to 
pay to deprive people of their church then who needs this kind of 
christian unity he said

jesse jackson said today he has not decided 
whether he would accept the democratic vice presidential nomination 
if it is offered but he said it is an option my constituency has 
earned 
on the final primary day of the season jackson carefully 
outlined his position on the vice presidency in an interview with 
abctv 
asked whether dukakis should offer him the vice presidency 
jackson said if he were to win extending the invitation to me is 
his option he said he did not know whether he would accept but 
then added it is an option my constituency has earned 
jackson and dukakis met monday night and again today jackson 
said they talked about a wide range of concerns from his call on 
dukakis to term south africa a terrorist state to his criticisms of 
the delegate selection process 
hes sensitive on these matters and were going to have some 
followup meetings necessarily to discuss matters of platform 
credentials rules the convention itself and beyond that our 
strategy for winning in november jackson said 
as we increase our own security level one with the other 
we accept our responsibility to guide our party to victory 
jackson concluded his primary campaign on a rough note arriving 
late to his halfhour television program monday night as it was 
broadcast in californias major markets he had fallen behind 
schedule in earlier campaign appearances in san francisco 
as jackson raced from the airport disc jockey casey kasem a 
longtime supporter filled the gap by interviewing jacksons state 
campaign manager chris hammond 
the show costing the campaign 150000 also featured footage of 
jackson speaking to crowds in a video montage with a song about 
jackson and the issues he has addressed in the campaign 
when jackson arrived he and kasem spent the rest of the program 
discussing his campaign issues 
i want to address our youth jackson said in closing 
revive their spirit renew their faith keep hope alive i 
offer authentic leadership 
jackson earlier put dukakis on notice that he will wage a 
convention floor fight over the massachusetts governors refusal to 
say south africa should be declared a terrorist state 
mr dukakis has proceeded rather cautiously and 
conservatively jackson said in a radio news conference during 
which he also criticized dukakis leadership 
he has not been willing to declare south africa a terrorist 
state by any definition of a terrorist state south africa 
qualifies jackson said 
in the strongest terms he has used to date to indicate his 
priorities for the party convention in atlanta jackson said if 
he will not bend on that matter well simply meet on the floor in 
atlanta 
speaking on the eve of todays primaries in california new 
jersey montana and new mexico jackson indicated he will fight to 
bend the convention to his concerns but will do it within the 
structure of the party rules 
its not just what i want i represent a constituency he 
told a rally in richmond calif what do my constituents want 
what renews their faith what makes their hope alive he said he 
then listed a litany of his campaign issues over such things as 
comparable pay for women affordable housing and health care and 
fair prices for farmers 
jackson also said he plans to use the rules to have fair 
rules regarding delegate selection procedures that he considers 
unfair 
jackson has been after dukakis to join him in calling for 
designation of south africa as a terrorist state because of 
pretorias backing for the brutal rebels in mozambique and its 
policies of apartheid press censorship and civil liberties 
restrictions 
countries on the us list of terrorist nations such as libya 
north korea and cuba are subject to trade and political sanctions 
jackson said he is convinced the ticket will take a strong 
position against apartheid and declare south africa to be a 
terrorist state 
and dukakis either will offer leadership on these basic 
issues or be following the wave of a convention taking him out to 
sea 
asked how he could support the likely nominee if dukakis as 
jackson contends lacks leadership jackson replied its not a 
question of integrity its a question of judgement and priorities 
and the governor like all of us will keep expanding and keep 
growing 
he also said dukakis willingness to use nuclear weapons in a 
first strike showed very bad judgment

the state department expressed regret tuesday 
that the kidnaping of a prominent colombian opposition leader has 
forced cancellation of a planned threeday visit here this week by 
president virgilio barco 
we understand the reasons behind the cancellation and 
sympathize with the colombian government spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said 
the cancellation was precipitated by the kidnaping on may 29 of 
alvaro gomez hurtado a former ambassador to washington who ran 
against barco in the 1986 elections as the conservative party 
candidate 
he was kidnapped by armed gunmen as he was leaving church 
services 
mrs oakley said the united states deplores the violent acts of 
individuals and groups in colombia and continues to hope that 
ambassador gomez will be returned to his family 
under questioning mrs oakley disagreed with the suggestion that 
the cancellation demonstrates that drug traffickers and terrorists 
control colombias political life 
rather she said it reflects barcos concern over the situation 
created by gomezs kidnapping and does not demonstrate anything of 
a political nature

intake valves were ordered turned off from 
this northeastern kentucky towns water supply source early tuesday 
as sludge from an underground tire fire poured into the little sandy 
river 
the blaze which started monday and involved possibly 200000 
discarded auto tires in a dump the size of a football field was 
producing a runoff of extremely contaminated and toxic oil 
according to don armstrong a spokesman for the state division of 
disaster and emergency services 
this has rather serious environmental implications because one 
tire can produce as much as three gallons of oil armstrong said 
the owner of the property charles blythe and his family were 
evacuated armstrong said he said blythe owned a home a hobby shop 
and a storage unit on the property 
it doesnt appear it the fire will be real easy to get put 
out so were looking at alternatives to decide which way to go 
said william c burger environmental response coordinator for the 
natural resources and environmental protection cabinet 
burger said two booms were placed across the river and water 
company officials downstream were notified 
water intake valves on the river were shut off at 3 am 
according to john kinner mayor of the town of 1400 people 
greenup has just 38000 gallons of reserve water for emergencies 
armstrong said kinner said residents have been asked to conserve 
and tanker trucks may be brought in to supply drinking water 
kinner said the valves could be closed for 24 hours

three space shuttle astronauts made a 
tricky mock emergency landing tuesday during a comprehensive launch 
rehearsal that tested hundreds of changes resulting from the 
challenger disaster 
the practice for the nations first shuttle mission in 2 years 
scheduled aug 31 exercised the launch team here and flight 
controllers in houston through the final three hours of a countdown 
and the harrowing minutes of a failure requiring splitsecond 
decisions 
astronaut bob crippen deputy director of shuttle operations who 
will make the final decision on whether a shuttle should be 
launched said the test pointed up a few areas in problemsolving 
that needed to be improved but all in all it was an excellent 
exercise 
challengers seven astronauts died when a faulty booster rocket 
caused their spaceship to explode jan 28 1986 with the two 
boosters still attached and burning the crew had no chance to 
escape that is still the case 
the simulated failure tuesday of two of the three main engines 
occurred seconds after the boosters burned out normally and were 
jettisoned enabling the three astronauts operating in a houston 
simulator to execute an abort maneuver called return to launch 
site or rtls 
we think weve lost the left engine astronaut loren shriver 
the simulator commander told mission control slightly more than two 
minutes after the pretend liftoff 
discovery we confirm the left engine is down abort rtls 
the control center radioed 
shriver and his crew members james wetherbee and franklin 
changdiaz flew the simulator to an altitude of about 75 miles 
and 400 miles out over the atlantic ocean to exhaust hundreds of 
thousands of gallons of fuel 
with a second engine now locked up and useless the 
astronauts pitched around went through the motions of jettisoning 
their huge external fuel tank into the ocean and battling hydraulic 
and other difficulties glided to the makebelieve touchdown on a 
runway three miles from the launch pad landing occurred 21 minutes 
after the abort maneuver began 
observing in houston were commander rick hauck and the four 
members of his crew who will fly the fourday discovery mission in 
august 
because of the challenger accident nasa has introduced hundreds 
of changes most aimed at safety into the launch process the 
changes include new procedures management responsibilities and 
ground and flight hardware and software 
the simulation tuesday was the only opportunity to check them out 
with the launchday team before the actual countdown 
under the new management structure one man crippen will make 
the final gono go decision on a shuttle launch his main adviser is 
launch director bob sieck both have scores of experts to call on 
crippen a veteran of four shuttle missions and sieck exercised 
their roles tuesday as intentional electrical communications and 
other problems were built into the count to give controllers 
experience in resolving them a simulated high fuel pressure reading 
31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a real launch but it 
was bypassed so the test could continue the troubleshooting 
delayed the simulated launch 55 minutes 
the remaining three shuttles have been grounded since the 
challenger accident with the major roadblock to flight being the 
testing of the redesigned booster rocket two more fullscale firing 
tests are scheduled june 10 and july 26 
discovery is undergoing final checks after a major overhaul and 
is scheduled to be moved to the launch pad june 27

the leftist sandinista government and 
rebel negotiators resumed talks today and sources on both sides 
said they were close to agreeing on a definitive end to hostilities 
as the talks began contra delegation leader alfredo cesar said 
the nicaraguan resistance is here with a political decision to 
sign a definite agreement for permanent and lasting peace in 
nicaragua if the government shows its political commitment to make 
the democratic reforms in this country to achieve that lasting 
peace 
a major stumbling block in the fourth round of the negotiations 
on achieving a lasting peace is a timetable for disarming the 
usbacked rebels sources said monday 
the sandinistas want the rebels known as contras to disarm by 
september the rebels want to do it by the end of january 
at the last parley may 2628 the sandinistas made concessions on 
what the rebels call the democratization of nicaragua and pledged to 
enact political reforms the contras demand 
but rebel representatives speaking privately to the associated 
press said the reforms remained too illdefined 
they include freedom of the press lifting of all political 
restrictions ending the ruling sandinista national liberation 
fronts control of the army and government the right to strike and 
electoral reforms 
the government also said it was willing to negotiate reforms 
within the framework of its dialogue with the internal opposition 
the contras reluctantly agreed at the last negotiating session to 
extend a 60day ceasefire that would have expired may 31 but they 
said they would not observe the truce past the end of this weeks 
talks 
the government had announced a unilateral 30day extension of the 
truce 
since the talks last month each side has accused the other of 
violating the truce at least one sandinista army soldier and 10 
rebels have been killed according to the defense ministry 
cesar said monday that the rebels were prepared to resume 
fighting if the talks failed 
the nicaraguan resistance does not want to reinitiate the war 
but if the sandinista government suspends the conversations our 
forces will be ready cesar said in san jose costa rica 
the resistance is the contras umbrella organization 
on monday night vice president sergio ramirez told reporters an 
accord with the rebels was a matter of moments because at best 
within a month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more 
ramirez also said negotiations only became possible because the 
reagan administration has been unable to win congressional support 
for continued military aid to the rebels 
despite their posturing the government and rebels appear to be 
closer to a permanent agreement than at any time since they signed 
their historic peace outline on march 23 in the southern border town 
of sopoa 
the sandinista government needs to end the war now in its 
seventh year to reconstruct an economy badly ravaged by the 
fighting that has claimed more than 26000 lives and to enact the 
social programs it promised when it came to power in a 1979 
revolution 
at the same time the contras are experiencing deep divisions 
among their ranks and were cut off from us military assistance at 
the end of february

ambulances were seen racing to and from the blast scene and fire 
engines doused at least two burning cars with water hoses

people and wounding 78 
on april 23 a car bomb blew up in a crowded vegetable market in 
the predominantly sunni moslem port city of tripoli killing 69

christians main militia for the blast there 
the lebanese forces command which denied involvement in the 
bombing accused the syrian secret service of masterminding the 
rmaeil car bombing

aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome has made the gay 
community more visible berrill said and the downside of lesbian 
and gay visibility is once youre more visible youre more of a 
target 
fifteen percent of all incidents reported last year and 5 percent 
of the physical assaults involved verbal reference to aids by the 
perpetrators or were directed against people with the disease the 
study found 
as in 1986 nearly twothirds of the local groups reporting 
antigay incidents last year believed that fear and hatred 
associated with aids has fostered antigay violence in their 
communities according to the report 
the overall statistics represented a small percentage of the 
actual number of antigay incidents occurring last year berrill 
said 
gay and lesbian victims are probably the least likely to report 
of any hate crime victims he said gay and lesbian people by 
reporting crimes against them to the police risk losing their jobs 
their homes and in some cases children 
nevertheless available data clearly demonstrate that the 
problem continues to be severe he said 
berrill called for federal and state legislation aimed at curbing 
antigay violence and better education of the public 
another reason for the increase in incidents reported may have 
been that the task force received more complete data than in the 
prior studies berrill noted the 7008 incidents in 1987 were 
reported by 64 groups in 32 states and the district of columbia 
compared with 4946 incidents from 41 groups in 27 states a year 
earlier 
the report was compiled by sending onepage questionnaires to 
more than 150 groups in all 50 states requesting any available local 
data on harassment or violence that occurred in 1987 groups were 
chosen based on the likelihood of knowledge about local incidents 
among those groups documenting greater violence last year were 
san franciscos community united against violence a gay 
victimassistance agency which saw 11 percent more violence victims 
in 1987 than in 1986 the new york city gay and lesbian 
antiviolence project said it served 14 percent more clients in 
1987 and the philadelphia lesbian and gay task force reported a 39 
percent increase in violent incidents 
the greatest increases came in acts of verbal harassment and 
threats of violence according to the report 
not only were there 1990 more such incidents reported in 1987 
than the previous year but harassment and threats also constituted 
a greater percentage of 1987s total 78 percent of all episodes in 
1987 as compared to 70 percent in 1986 it said 
acts of vandalism also increased 338 in 1987 up from 191 in 
1986 
while 835 physical assaults were reported in 1987 compared with 
732 in 1986 they represented a slightly smaller percentage of total 
incidents 12 percent in 1987 down from 15 percent in 1986 
reports of policerelated incidents declined from 410 to 217 
other declines were in reports of arson bombings bomb threats and 
homicides 
north carolina had more reported incidents than any other state 
a total of 1985 of which 1913 were harassment or threats the 
report found berrill attributed this to the fact that organized 
hate groups are active in the state 
new york state led all others in the number of antigay 
homicides the report found of a total of 408 incidents reported in 
new york 20 were homicides sixtyfour murders were reported 
nationwide 
the study also highlighted federal state and local initiatives 
to combat such violence including passage of a hate crimes 
statistics bill by the house last month the bill would require 
federal collection of statistics on crimes motivated by race 
religion sexual orientation or ethnicity 
a companion bill has been introduced in the senate by sen alan 
cranston dcalif

the final round of the primary season was considerably less than 
an allout struggle 
dukakis spent less than 250000 on television in california and 
nothing on tv advertising in new jersey 
jacksons campaign said it was spending 700000 in california 
but even that was a relative pittance in the state with the most 
delegates of all 
bush trying to avoid overshooting federal spending limitations 
had no commercials and little organizational effort his california 
office had one paid staff member and a handful of telephone lines 
all this was in astonishing contrast to the primaries and 
caucuses at the beginning of the campaign season when bush 
dukakis jackson and their rivals of long ago lavished time and 
money on states such as iowa and new hampshire 
it was a marked contrast as well to republican and democratic 
campaigns of the past when the outcome of nominating struggles hung 
in the balance to be tipped one way or another by the voters of 
california or new jersey 
and even as one primary season was ending congress was debating 
whether to make changes in the next one a senate committee heard 
testimony during the day on legislation to establish a regional 
primary system with the states clustered into half a dozen 
geographical categories 
thus ended a primary season that began with the clamor of more 
than a dozen candidates but sorted out quickly 
that was true particularly on the republican side where bush 
made short work of his five rivals even though he was very nearly an 
early campaign casualty 
the vice president finished third in the leadoff iowa caucuses 
behind sen bob dole of kansas and former television evangelist pat 
robertson 
but as his political obituaries were being prepared bush scored 
a stunning victory in the new hampshire primary followed by a solid 
win in south carolina he parlayed these successes into a 16state 
sweep of super tuesday primaries on march 8 from then it was a 
casual stroll to clinching the republican nomination 
ironically just as he conquered the republican field bush was 
having trouble in the national polls his standing plummeted as the 
reagan administrations controversies mounted and in the final 
weeks of primary campaigning bush began setting himself apart from 
the president on dealings with panamas manuel noriega and offshore 
oil drilling 
he said more differences with the president would emerge well 
probably be dragged into more of these things rather than less but 
i will try to keep it that i dont go out and do something to tear 
down or be negative about this president it may not always be that 
easy he said 
the democratic nominating campaign was more turbulent but even 
so it was essentially settled far earlier than seemed possible last 
winter 
with frontrunner gary hart briefly sidelined by his donna rice 
crisis dukakis was lumped with his rivals as one of the seven 
dwarfs the pack even when hart reentered was seemingly 
overshadowed by speculation of a brokered national convention or a 
draft candidate such as new york gov mario cuomo 
dukakis route to the nomination mirrored the man steady and 
methodical he finished third in iowa as did bush then rebounded 
to capture a backyard victory in new hampshire 
his super tuesday was considerably less so than the vice 
presidents but super enough dukakis managed to pull out southern 
victories in florida and texas with less than half the vote he won 
at home in new england and in maryland the same day 
but he stumbled the next time out finishing third in the 
illinois primary and was embarrassed a few days later when jackson 
trounced him in the michigan caucuses that was the end of his 
primary disappointments 
he then began a springtime surge through the primaries that 
forced all his rivals but jackson from the field and left little 
or no doubt that he would be the nominee 
leading to the final week of the campaign he won nine of the 
last 10 primaries often by landslide margins over his sole 
remaining rival and gradually built his delegate totals toward the 
nomination

almost 1000 people have died of 
starvation in a parched southern town that hasnt received relief 
food for about a year and most of the deaths occurred in recent 
weeks a sudanese official said tuesday 
sultan pio tem commissioner of the eastern part of bahr 
elghazal region told reporters the victims were residents of 
aweil northwest of the regional capital wau he said the victims 
also included people forced into the town by fierce fighting in the 
5yearold civil war 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army holds 90 percent of the 
countryside in the south the government retains control of the 
large towns and cities and many peasants have fled to them seeking 
army protection 
tem said the latest telegram he received from aweil reported 786 
people had died from hunger and hungerrelated diseases from may 24 
to june 1 
he said 210 others perished earlier from the same causes and that 
starvation deaths continue to occur there daily he did not say how 
many were dying each day 
tem was in khartoum seeking relief food for the town he said he 
was to meet with darios beshir bahr elghazals regional govenor 
tem said relief supplies had not reached aweil since a consignment 
of rice and edible oil arrived by train a year ago 
prime minister sadek elmahdi has not replied to an appeal for 
food and medicine addressed to the government and to western relief 
organizations tem said adding he was trying to meet with elmahdi 
to urge him to declare aweil a hunger area 
elmahdi has announced that the united nations is sponsoring a 
program to transport relief food to the south but no date has been 
set for the operation 
the spla took up arms against the government in 1983 to demand 
more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms the years of 
fighting have corresponded with one of the worst famines in sudan in 
years

former vice president walter mondale on tuesday 
urged congress to order a system of regional presidential primaries 
to replace a hodgepodge that cries out for reform 
mondale who won the democratic presidential nomination in 1984 
but lost the general election to president reagan testified in 
support of a bill that would require such regional primaries with 
the dates to be decided by the federal election commission 
it would also outlaw interparty crossover voting in primaries 
the measure is sponsored by sen alan dixon dill though he 
told the senate committee on rules and administration that the bill 
is not my brainchild he noted that similar legislation was 
introduced by thensen mondale of minnesota in 1974 
mondale testifying on the final day of the 1988 campaign season 
said the present nominating system is the hodgepodge result of a 
decadeslong accretion of rules and amendments by the conventions 
and national committees of the two political parties 
he said primaries in widely scattered parts of the nation on the 
same day such as tuesdays schedule of contests in new jersey 
california montana and new mexico make it impossible for 
candidates to address the issues and meet the voters 
he urged the panel to support the bill which would allow states 
to decide on a caucus or primary form of election but would require 
them to hold the event on a specific date based on their region 
the six regional primaries according to the bill would begin on 
the last tuesday in march and end on the second tuesday in june the 
fec would decide the order by lots each year 
mondale drawing on his own experience also criticized the 
influence of iowa and new hampshire which hold the 
firstinthenation caucus and primary respectively 
in comments to reporters after his testimony he said i lived 
in new hampshire for three years virtually i could have gotten 
elected mayor in most of those towns the same in iowa 
my theory is we ought to rotate those states so you do that in 
other states we never had a southern state a western state if 
were going to do that lets circulate it 
mondale said the present system is not all bad by any means 
but nevertheless cries out for reform he called on congress to 
act now rather than drop the issue until the next 
presidentialelection year

the presidential primary season was kind to 
democrat michael dukakis but disquieting to republican george bush 
who struggles to define the race in his terms despite clinching the 
nomination two months ago 
the primary election results and the current polls could be 
likened to the electorates first impressions of the candidates 
impressions likely to change as they get to know the contenders 
better in the fall 
right now dukakis is riding a wave of public desire for change 
after nearly eight years of ronald reagan the public may be looking 
for something different a change of direction 
democratic and republican pollsters alike report americans are 
uneasy with the economy and concerned that the country is headed in 
the wrong direction 
bush is suffering from an inability to define the race in his 
terms peace and prosperity is a theme that has worked well for 
republicans in the past but so far bush hasnt been able to 
convince voters that it applies today 
i cant wait for this primary season to end the vice 
president tells rallies 
from the bush viewpoint dukakis has had the best of all worlds 
the past three months 
the contest for the republican presidential nomination 
effectively ended on march 8 super tuesday when bush swept 16 
primaries and sent sen bob dole of kansas staggering back to the 
midwest in search of a miracle any lingering doubts about the 
outcome ended a week later with another bush landslide in illinois 
he mathematically locked up the nomination in pennsylvania on april 
26 
the gop race was over a footnote to news accounts of the 
struggle among the democrats 
dukakis ran poorly in illinois where the big democratic winners 
were two home state favorites sen paul simon and jesse jackson 
when the scene shifted to michigan things looked even worse for 
the massachusetts governor he was beaten again this time by 
jackson 
wheres mario came the cry from democrats nervously looking 
for a winner but gov mario cuomo of new york preferred the role of 
kibitzer to that of candidate 
the nervousness among democrats proved unfounded when the 
contest came down to a choice between dukakis and jackson the 
massachusetts governor ran off with a string of victories 
nearly every wednesday morning for two months americans learned 
of yet another dukakis victory as one republican strategist put it 
with every victory he grew another inch 
the bush campaign chafed under another reality of the democratic 
race in a dukakisjackson contest the massachusetts governor came 
off as the moderate 
bush lamented that one national poll found twothirds of the 
respondents considered dukakis more conservative than the vice 
president 
theres something weird about that said bush 
there also is the prospect that things will get worse for bush 
before they get better 
the democratic convention is in july and if dukakis succeeds in 
resolving some potential pitfalls and presents a festival of unity 
for four days on national television he is almost certain to get 
another boost in the polls 
bush campaign manager lee atwater concedes that the vice 
president could be trailing by as much as 20 points in surveys 
before the republican convention in august 
but before dukakis can send out invitations to his inauguration 
he has some problems to resolve 
the biggest one is jackson 
the former civil rights leader has a hold on the democratic 
partys most loyal constituency and many of his followers think 
jackson must be offered the vice presidential nomination an offer 
dukakis isnt likely to make unless he is certain it would be turned 
down 
jackson also is threatening to wage convention fights for 
platform planks he favors 
there are no foreseeable conflicts for the gop convention 
allowing bush to gain maximum benefits from the gop coronation 
and as bush reads the current polls showing him trailing dukakis 
he also can take comfort in the fact that when voters start focusing 
on presidential campaigns in the fall the race inevitably tightens 
often dramatically

kitty dukakis plans to leave massachusetts general 
hospital on thursday less than a week after undergoing neck surgery 
to eliminate a condition that could have caused paralysis 
the wife of democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
said tuesday in a telephone interview that doctors at the hospital 
told her she could leave later this week 
my neck is fine im walking without help i have just a little 
pain in my hip mrs dukakis said her hip pain is the result of 
fridays surgery in which doctors removed two small bone fragments 
and used them to replace two herniated discs in her neck 
mrs dukakis was alert and sitting up in bed but sounded 
slightly hoarse in the interview 
she said she longed to be with her husband for tuesdays 
california primary the last event in the long preconvention 
season i wish i was somewhere else she said shortly after 
speaking to her husband at 630 am california time he sounded 
a little weary 
in the meantime mrs dukakis sorted through piles of gifts and 
cards and walked the hallways of the hospital visiting other 
patients 
she said she received lots of candy fruit and flowers from 
friends relatives and some of her husbands democratic rivals but 
nothing so far from president reagan or the certain republican 
nominee vice president george bush 
doctors have prescribed rest at home for mrs dukakis when she 
leaves the hospital and a curtailed campaign schedule until the 
democratic national convention which opens july 18 in atlanta 
dr nicholas t zervas chief of neurology at the hospital told 
mrs dukakis that she would have to wear a neck brace for at most 
eight weeks a period that could include the convention 
if i have to big deal she said of the possibility of 
joining her husband at the podium in a brace 
doctors plan to take xrays next month to make sure her neck is

rep claude pepper marshaled an array of 
influential lawmakers tuesday as he prepared for a doordie effort 
in the house to pass a costly new home health care program 
peppers plan scheduled for floor action wednesday would expand 
medicare to include longterm home care benefits for anyone of any 
age who is chronically ill or cant perform tasks of daily living 
with opponents mobilizing to prevent a vote on the bill pepper 
rallied his own forces tuesday at a news conference sens edward 
kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee sen paul simon dill the senate sponsor of the bill 
and reps richard gephardt dmo who holds the no 4 leadership 
position in the house and henry waxman dcalif chairman of the 
house energy and commerce health subcommittee 
we have a total vacuum when it comes to longterm care 
pepper dfla said a million people a year become destitute 
trying to pay for catastrophic care 
the pepper bill has provoked criticism on several counts among 
them its high cost its lack of a nursing home component and the 
unorthodox manner in which it bypassed committee scrutiny and sped 
to the house floor 
we should not allow the rules of the house to be manipulated to 
satisfy the popular issue of the moment house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said tuesday in a 
letter to his colleagues he said the committee system protects 
members from being forced to vote on popularappearing proposals 
that may ultimately prove to be embarrassing 
the pepper bill is putting house members particularly democrats 
in a bind because withiout their support there is no chance congress 
will pass the bill before adjourning this year 
there is overwhelming public sentiment in favor of a longterm 
care program there also is an election in six months and the 
87yearold pepper who is popular with elderly voters has made 
campaign appearances on behalf of many lawmakers in the past 
the congressional budget office estimates the home care program 
would cost nearly 28 billion over five years it would be paid for 
by imposing the medicare payroll tax on income above 45000 which 
is currently exempt 
supporters of the plan also backed a new catastrophic care 
benefit bill to help the elderly cope with acute illness that 
medicare expansion more than a year in the making has passed the 
house and is expected to pass the senate this week 
but waxman called that measure only half the roof that people 
need to shield them from health care catastrophes i always feel 
guilty calling this other bill the catastrophic bill 
pepper initially tried to attach his plan to the catastrophic 
bill but withdrew it when lawmakers said it would sink that 
legislation in return house speaker jim wright dtexas agreed to 
let pepper have a separate floor vote on his plan 
pepper chairman of the rules committee that schedules floor 
action scheduled his own bill last year effectively bypassing 
rostenkowskis committee and the energy and commerce committee 
headed by john dingell dmich which ordinarily would have 
considered the pepper bill 
rostenkowski complained in his dear colleague letter that the 
bill was brought to the floor via an extremely unusual and 
troubling procedure 
he also said the agencies necessary to administer the pepper plan 
do not exist and history has demonstrated that such a big program 
cannot be put in place quickly without encouraging inept or 
fraudulent management and he said cbo estimates show the program 
would face an annual deficit within five years 
pepper dismissed the notion that he was abusing the committee 
process saying what happened with his bill was unique and would not 
become routine 
the rules committee is not going to run rampant over anybody 
pepper said tuesday all they want to do is kill the bill and use 
the money for something else 
in a dear colleague letter of their own dated june 8 pepper 
and his cosponsor rep edward roybal dcalif called cost and 
procedure issues bogus reasons to oppose the bill 
they said the bill contains a cap on costs and does not violate 
any procedural rules of the house 
they also said outside opposition groups such as the insurance 
industry would oppose any longterm care bill because they serve 
their own narrow selfinterest not the american peoples interest

widespread violence and eight 
deaths were reported tuesday the second day of a nationwide general 
strike that organizers claimed involved 25 million people 
employers and transport companies said support for the strike had 
dwindled and that more workers were on the job in many areas 
in durban however the federated chamber of industries said the 
strike had intensified around the nations thirdlargest city 
black labor unions and antiapartheid groups called the threeday 
protest which the government says is illegal to oppose the 
2yearold state of emergency and proposed legislation to restrict 
the rights of unions to strike 
the congress of south african trade unions the largest black 
labor federation said at least 25 million people were staying away 
from jobs and schools it called the strike the most significant to 
date 
general secretary jay naidoo denied government claims that the 
protest was being sustained by intimidation 
he told reporters the strike was a reflection of the widescale 
resentment and anger about orders issued in february that barred 
his organization and other antiapartheid groups from political 
activity 
president pw bothas government imposed the emergency june 12 
1986 to combat a black uprising against apartheid the policy of 
race discrimination that preserves privilege for south africas 5 
million whites and denies the 26 million blacks a voice in national 
affairs 
in lusaka zambia the exile headquarters of the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement declared unequivocal 
support for the strike the anc is the main group fighting white 
domination in south africa 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the strike appears to enjoy the overwhelming support of the 
disenfranchised majority in south africa and has so far been 
peaceful 
we hope all parties will continue to avoid violence the strike 
underscores the urgent need for negotiations among south africans to 
replace apartheid with a democratic constitutional order 
the threeday strike is the largest black protest under the 
emergency 
a report by staterun south african broadcasting corp said 
participation declined by 45 percent tuesday but gave no estimate of 
the number of people involved it said in an editorial that the 
strike represented the strategy of radical activists who want to 
make south africa ungovernable 
police would not comment on the scope of the protest because 
they said emergency regulations prohibit such reports headquarters 
advised local news media to consult lawyers before publishing 
stories about the strike 
authorities reported more than two dozen incidents of violence 
monday night and early tuesday including firebombings and stonings 
of homes buses and trains twentyone arrests and 23 injuries were 
reported 
officers shot to death a young black when a municipal police unit 
was stoned according to police spokesmen they said seven other 
blacks including three children were killed in shootings a hand 
grenade attack and a firebombing 
five of the deaths occurred near durban there was an unconfirmed 
report of four more killings there 
the protest has aggravated a feud in the area between black 
militants and more conservative blacks who support zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi an opponent of strikes and other 
confrontational tactics 
the mining industry which produces 80 percent of south africas 
export earnings has been only slightly affected by the strike 
only one gold mine reported significant absenteeism the national 
mineworkers union and mine owners gave conflicting reports of strike 
action at diamond and coal mines but the union conceded effects 
were limited 
all seven major auto assembly plants were closed 
according to putco a private bus company that carries 300000 
black commuters daily ridership from johannesburgs huge black 
township of soweto increased from 10 percent of normal monday to 25 
percent tuesday 
it said traffic was near normal in pretoria but remained at 10 
percent around durban the staterun south african transport 
services said rail commuter traffic had increased dramatically in 
most areas 
in some black areas around johannesburg where transport was 
disrupted police used trucks to carry people to the nearest 
functioning bus routes 
schools remained empty in soweto and other black townships many 
students are expected to extend a scheduled vacation period that 
begins monday by staying home the rest of this week 
the star of johannesburg the countrys largest daily newspaper 
said in an editorial there will be no winners in this 
illconsidered clash the country will never know how many who 
stayed away did so out of political conviction how many out of fear 
of retribution or simply the chance of a day off

question is 269 percent fully a third 
the correct answer is no but 269 percent is described as 
equaling a third in a foreword to the federal mathematics study 
released tuesday by the national assessment of educational progress 
gregory anrig president of the educational testing service 
which runs the governmentsponsored testing program wrote in a 
preface that fully a third of our 13yearolds havent mastered 
skills universally taught in elementary school 
the executive summary of the report also said it was alarming 
that onethird of these students didnt score 250 on the 500point 
test a level indicating they can perform basic operations and begin 
to solve problems 
but a chart accompanying the test indicated that in 1986 731 
percent of the 13yearolds actually reached that level up from 
649 percent in 1978 
the full text of the report the mathematics report card are 
we measuring up referring to the same statistics says it is 
alarming that onequarter of the seventh and eighth graders 
amounting to more than threequarters of a million students may 
not possess the skills necessary to perform many everyday 
tasks 
kent ashworth a spokesman for the national assessment 
acknowledged that fully a third was a mistake and expressed 
surprise that it had gotten past the reports proofreaders

medical testing labs would come under strict 
federal regulation under a bill introduced tuesday by sens carl 
levin dmich and william cohen rmaine 
the bill would affect the 80000 to 100000 medical laboratories 
not now under federal regulation most are in doctors offices 
levin said 
our legislation changes the focus of lab testing to emphasize 
quality over quantity said levin that difference can have 
lifeordeath consequences 
the legislation would establish maximum workload limits for lab 
workers who examine pap smears strengthen federal enforcement 
authority over labs and set standards for the laboratories 
from the patients point of view there should be just as much 
assurance that tests conducted in a doctors office are as 
accurate as those conducted in a hospital or commercial lab levin

president reagan signed legislation tuesday to 
make us laws comply with a recent fisheries treaty governing 
tunarich waters of the south pacific saying the pact will set a 
tone of cooperation rather than confrontation 
the treaty provides for us fishermen to purchase regional 
licenses to fish for tuna in some 10 million square miles of the 
south pacific ocean 
it will set to rest the fisheriesrelated problems we have 
experienced stemming from our differing judicial positions 
concerning highly migratory species of tuna reagan said 
the president also said that license fees and a related economic 
assistance agreement will further the economic development and 
strengthen the democratic traditions of the pacific island states 
participating in the treaty 
the treaty is historic in both its complexity and scope and 
culminates over two years of difficult negotiations reagan said 
its successful implementation will set a tone of cooperation 
rather than confrontation in our fisheries relations with 15 island 
nations of the south pacific

the national highway traffic safety 
administration acted reasonably in lowering mandatory fuel economy 
standards to 26 miles per gallon a federal appeals court ruled 
21 tuesday 
nhtsa lowered the corporate average fuel economy or cafe 
standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 275 mpg set by 
congress to 26 mpg asserting the higher standard was not 
economically practical 
the state of california the cities of los angeles and new york 
and four citizens groups led by washingtonbased public citizen 
filed petitions requesting a court review of the order 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in an opinion by judge ruth ginsburg said nhtsas consideration 
of the likelihood of economic hardship within its assessment of 
economic practicability must be given due weight 
the agencys decision was based on analysis that concluded the 
higher standard would have severe economic effects throughout the 
auto industry and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as the 
petitioners had charged the court said 
the petitioners also asserted that nhtsa by lowering the 
standard had failed to consider the nations need to conserve 
energy the cafe standards were initially adopted in the 1970s to 
reduce us dependence on foreign oil 
the court however said the agency had weighed increased fuel 
consumption against economic harm under broad guidelines set by 
congress 
had congress offered a more precise balancing formula for the 
agency to apply we could more confidently discern the agencys 
compliance with the congressional mandate the court said 
in the absence of such precision the court said it must conclude 
nhtsa had properly accomodated conflicting policies in lowering the 
standard 
mrs ginsbug was joined in the majority by judge abner mikva 
judge lawrence silberman dissented 
transportation secretary jim burnley has called for repeal of the 
cafe standards saying in an era of cheaper energy they have 
outlived their usefulness and harm the us auto industrys 
competitiveness 
supporters of the standards argue they must be retained to keep 
the nation from again slipping into deep dependence on unreliable 
foreign sources of oil 
besides nhtsa the petitions named ford motor co the automobile 
importers of america inc and general motors corp as defendants

the parliament passed a constitutional 
amendment tuesday making islam the state religion thousands of 
opponents took to the streets in protest blocking traffic and 
damaging vehicles 
the 300member parliament dominated by president hussain 
muhammad ershads jatiya party passed the controversial bill 2540 
fifteen members of minor opposition parties walked out before the 
vote two independents joined the jatiya party to enact the bill 
which was proposed may 11 
the amendment makes an islamic republic out of this oncesecular 
state created after a 1971 war of independence from pakistan 
shortly after the legislation was passed several thousand 
members of 21 nonvoting opposition groups streamed into the 
streets these parties have no representatives in parliament because 
they boycotted march elections in which ershad won a 252seat 
parliamentary majority 
witnesses said the mobs stopped traffic at several intersections 
in downtown dhaka and damaged seven staterun buses and a police 
jeep 
riot police were on duty but no clashes were reported 
the proposed bill drew especially strong criticism from womens 
groups opposition parties and minority religions in a country whose 
105 million people are 85 percent moslem there are an estimated 
250000 christians in bangladesh as well as hindu and buddhist 
minorities 
the bill amends the bangladesh constitution to insert the 
sentence the religion of the republic is islam but other 
religions may be practiced in peace and harmony the government 
says the bill does not change the legal system to one that would 
follow the koran the moslem holy book 
womens rights groups however fear that moslem fundamentalists 
may use the amendment to pressure the state to pass more rigid laws 
following islamic traditions such as those requiring women to hide 
their faces behind veils 
but observers say there is little possibility that the amendment 
would pull bangladesh into a social system resembling the islamic 
fundamentalism of iran 
about 3000 demonstrators including teachers journalists and 
doctors marched through the streets of dhaka on saturday to 
protest the change shouting antigovernment slogans 
christian leaders had appealed to ershad to withdraw the 
legislation 
among those who signed the statement was the rev michael 
rozario the roman catholic archibishop of dhaka and 
representatives of other christian denominations 
before the legislation was passed prime minister maudud ahmed 
assured minority groups that they should not fear the amendment and 
told the parliament that the bill was to free islam from the hands 
of fundamentalists and the traders of religion 
but political analysts in dhaka have said they believe ershads 
main reason for launching islam as the official religion was to woo 
islamic fundamentalists some of whom are campaigning against his 
regime for being too lax in supporting moslem traditions 
ershad a former army general came to power in a bloodless coup 
in march 1982 and was elected president in october 1986 the major 
opposition groups contend the elections were rigged 
they boycotted the march elections saying they also would be 
rigged and vowed not to participate in elections until ershad 
leaves office

the new hampshire civil liberties union said 
tuesday it will help with an appeal on behalf of a 9yearold boy 
and his parents who refuse to medicate him to control his 
hyperactivity in school 
the group agreed to assist casey jessons lawyer in appealing a 
state hearing officers decision that the boy must take ritalin or 
an alternative drug to calm hyperactive children if he continues to 
attend regular public school classes next year 
school officials in derry said casey was manageable on ritalin 
and that without it he has temper tantrums and is disruptive 
his parents valerie and michael said ritalin made casey act 
like a drug addict with facial twitches little appetite and 
insomnia they stopped giving him ritalin in april 1987 after he 
spent 18 months on the drug 
the appeal likely will be filed in federal court where precedent 
exists for such matters claire ebel the clus executive director 
said tuesday 
the first line of defense will be to assert caseys 
constitutional right to privacy when medical treatment is involved 
she said 
for any government agency such as the state education 
department to violate that privacy there must exist a compelling 
state interest and we dont believe that has been proven she said 
the groups lawyers also believe caseys rights as an 
educationally handicapped child have been violated ebel said 
hearing officer eric falkenham ruled last month that returning 
casey to class without medication would harm his education and that 
of his classmates 
falkehham also said the jessons would have to pay to have casey 
placed in a more restrictive specialized class if they refuse to 
medicate him 
in an agreement between the state and caseys parents he is 
being tutored until the school year ends later this month

leaders of the nations public and nonprofit 
employee organizations joined with legislators tuesday to denounce 
an internal revenue service proposal that would tax such benefits as 
vacation pay and sick leave even if they are not used 
the irs decision is baffling and at some real level inhumane 
sen daniel p moynihan dny said at a news conference the 
moment you start taxing sick leave that is not used people start 
using sick leave 
william l mcgowan president of the civil service employees 
association of new york state the states largest public employee 
union echoed the senators objections 
whoevers doing the thinking on this isnt thinking very 
clearly he said 
mcgowan estimated that if his unions 250000 members used all 
their sick time and vacation leave every year it would be the 
equivalent of an 18 percent cutback in the workforce 
the proposal at issue was put forward by the irs in january 1987 
to change a section of the internal revenue code 
the irs issued a public notice that section 457 which provides 
rules for certain types of deferred compensation for employees of 
state and local governments and taxexempt organizations would be 
interpreted to apply to nonelective deferred compensation this 
would include such benefits as vacation pay sick leave 
compensatory time severance pay disability and death benefit plans 
until that announcement public and nonprofit employers had 
generally understood the restrictions of section 457 to apply only 
to elective deferred compensation or salary that an employee 
postpones receiving moynihan explained 
moynihan introduced legislation tuesday to amend the internal 
revenue code to clarify that section 457 would not apply to 
nonelective deferred compensation 
at the same time however he conceded that the bill has little 
chance of passing this year because congress is not slated to 
address a major tax bill 
he also wrote last week to treasury secretary james a baker iii 
urging that the irs reconsider its position so the matter can be 
resolved without legislation

the drought that has gripped north georgia is 
causing a new kind of battle among lawnconscious suburbanites some 
of whom are reporting their neighbors for ignoring tight 
restrictions on outdoor water use 
fulton countys public works department has been swamped with 
water calls said operator evelyn smith who estimated that 90 
percent of the departments recent calls have been about outdoor 
watering 
they say their lawns so pretty and green how come they get 
to water and i dont she said 
theyre calling in on their neighbors basically said cobb 
county police radio operator nina reber 
some are pretty mad said gus monroe deputy director of 
dekalb countys water department some just want to complain lots 
are just teed off at their neighbors 
gwinnett county water department director gary beaufait said his 
department received nearly 230 calls over the weekend when a 
resident sees somebody else watering i would imagine he would be 
irritated beaufait said 
almost every government in the atlanta area has restrictions on 
when lawns can be watered and cars washed 
the city of roswell in northern fulton county announced that it 
would ban outdoor watering 24 hours a day beginning at midnight 
tuesday 
atlanta has banned outdoor watering from 7 am to 11 am since 
november and its water bureau is recommending that residents use 
water outdoors on odd or even days depending on their address 
despite the bans faucets in about 1000 north fulton county 
homes went dry from about 9 pm monday until 1 am tuesday said 
county water supervisor hershel barrett he said the area which 
bans outdoor watering from noon until 9 pm ran out of water 
because many residents just dragged out the water hoses and went 
to town when the ban expired monday night 
we were for all practical purposes out of water last night 
he said tuesday 
about 200 homes in southern forsyth county where water was 
purchased from fulton county also lost water for three to four 
hours monday night said forsyth water department director tom heard 
georgia state climatologist gayther plummer said there have been 
only 210 inches of rain in most parts of north georgia in the last 
five years the region averages 50 inches of rainfall per year or 
250 inches in five years 
lake lanier the metropolitan areas primary water source was at 
10627 feet above sea level tuesday 10 feet above its record low 
of 10527 feet set dec 24 1981 
all indications are that this is going to be a very critical 
drought in the northern part of the state said david word chief 
of water resource management for the georgia department of natural 
resources it is going to be worse than 86 
however word said the driest weather this year is confined to 
north georgia unlike the statewide drought in 1986 
the water situation in the northeast georgia town of clayton 
which was without water for 36 hours during the summer of 1986 
will be critical if the town doesnt receive significant rainfall 
soon mayor tom ramey said tuesday 
but ramey said the experience of running out of water taught 
residents the importance of conservation 
it was a lesson well learned because when they turned that tap 
on and nothing came out they knew we werent fooling he said

the unit 2 reactor at sequoyah nuclear 
plant automatically shut down monday afternoon for the third time 
since it was restarted last month said a tennessee valley authority 
official 
the reason for the 215 pm edt shutdown was not immediately 
known said janice brady a spokeswoman for plant manager steve 
smith 
it occurred less than a week after the reactor reached 100 
percent power for the first time since it was restarted following a 
33month shutdown 
tva brought unit 2 back on line may 13 the agencys first 
reactor to be restarted since its nuclear system was shut down in 
august 1985 to correct safety and management problems

capacity may 31 
sequoyah unit 2 began commercial operation in june 1982 the 
following year it set a tva record by operating 195 consecutive 
days without a shutdown that record was later broken by a 197day 
streak by unit 1 in 1984 and 1985 
tva tentatively plans to restart sequoyah unit 1 in august or 
september with unit 2 at the threereactor browns ferry nuclear 
plant near athens ala to follow by the end of the year

americans increased their installment borrowing 
at a moderate annual rate of 7 percent in april as growth in 
consumer credit slowed from the first three months of the year the 
government said tuesday 
the federal reserve board said consumers took out 365 billion 
more in credit than they paid off in april compared with net growth 
of 52 billion in march 50 billion in february and 62 billion 
in january 
the annual rate of growth in april was slightly slower than the 
72 percent rate for all of 1987 and considerably slower than the 
approximately 107 percent pace for the first quarter of 1988 
however economists saw the slowing as a healthy trend at a time 
when us manufacturers are trying to boost their production for 
export 
whats happened is what should be happening consumer spending 
is cooling off and freeing up resources to produce for export 
said sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a 
washington consulting firm 
the whole transition from a consumerled economy to an 
exportled economy assumes we can cool off consumer demand in order 
to avoid heated up inflation she said 
she said consumer debt grew faster than the norm in the 
januarymarch period because of a surge in auto sales 
in april auto loans grew by 155 billion a yearly growth rate 
of 67 percent compared with a rate of 159 percent in march and 
145 percent in february 
the category that includes credit card debt showed the strongest 
increase in april 161 billion for an 117 percent expansion 
pace compared with 16 percent in march and 103 percent in february 
the credit report said the category that includes bank and credit 
union loans not secured by real estate increased by 478 million in 
april a 36 percent jump compared with a 37 percent decline a 
month earlier 
borrowing for mobile homes increased by 13 million 06 percent 
after a drop of 58 percent in march 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 6331 billion at 
the end of april up 91 percent from a year earlier 
still ms shaber said consumer borrowing as a percentage of 
income has remained steady at just under 19 percent for a year and a 
half

a governmentsponsored study concluded tuesday 
that american students are doing miserably in math and experts laid 
some of the blame on the redundant slowpaced way math is taught in 
most schools 
the national assessment of educational progress reported that 
almost half the 17yearold students tested in 198586 proved 
incapable of handling math commonly taught in junior high and 
nearly 27 percent of 13yearolds were stumped by basic computations 
our ninth graders are taking what other peoples seventh 
graders are taking chester finn jr the assistant us secretary 
of education for research and improvement told a news conference 
weve got to get it going faster repeated less and make sure that 
its learned more 
the study was based on exams given to nearly 15000 students ages 
9 13 and 17 in 198586 and to a total of nearly 35000 students in 
grades 3 7 and 11 it was the fourth national assessment in math 
since 197273 
the study the mathematics report card are we measuring up 
said all three age groups made modest improvements in recent years 
but mostly on loworder skills fewer were capable of advanced work 
in 1986 than in 1978 
despite signs of their progress across time the 1986 
performance of 17yearold students was dismal the report said 
only half the high school students demonstrated an understanding 
of even moderately complex mathematical procedures usually 
introduced in junior high 
the report said math classes are dominated by paperandpencil 
drills on basic computation little evidence appears of any 
widespread use of calculators computers or mathematics projects 
more than a quarter of the 17yearolds reported they usually do 
not understand what is talked about in mathematics class 
math instruction is dominated by teacher explanations 
chalkboard presentations and reliance on textbooks and workshops 
more innovative forms of instruction such as small group 
activities laboratory work and special projects remain 
disappointingly rare 
the early emphasis on practicing computations may serve to 
divorce mathematics from realworld observations the report said 
once students learn to rely on procedures they tend to give up on 
common sense this can lead to preposterous answers 
were seeing a lot of drill and practice on obsolete skills 
said john a dossey an illinois state university math professor 
but the students tested in 1986 also reported getting more 
homework and tests in math and more were enrolled in advanced 
courses 
the report said 98 percent of the 9yearolds and 100 percent of 
the older students knew simple arithmetic facts but virtually none 
of the younger students and only 64 percent of the oldest could 
solve multistep problems and algebra questions 
black and hispanic students as well as those living in the 
southeast gained ground but remain far behind the white majority 
the national assessment administered by educational testing 
service tests a sample of american students in basic subjects every 
other year 
finn whose department pays for the testing said that despite 
minority gains only one black 17yearold student in 300 and 
barely 1 percent of the hispanic kids scored at the advanced 
level compared with 76 percent of the whites 
lawmakers decried the studys findings 
sen lawton chiles dfla called it tragic and said to 
the question mathematics are we measuring up the answer is 
simply no 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif chairman of the house 
education and labor committee called it quite sobering and said 
it was shameful that japanese companies seeking to open plants 
here must use graduate students to do calculations done by high 
schoolers in japan 
the tests indicated girls and boys had identical average 
mathematics proficiency at age 9 but boys outscored girls at 13 
and 17 
females tend to outperform males on tasks where there is an 
obvious procedural rule to follow while the reverse seems to be 
true when the strategy for solving the problem is less apparent 
the study said 
the national assessment devised its own 0to500point scale to 
chart students proficiency the percentages of 9 13 and 
17yearold students at or above the five proficiency levels in 1986 
were 
level 150 simple arithmetic facts 978 percent of 9yearolds 
100 percent of 13yearolds 100 percent of 17yearolds 
level 200 beginning skills and understanding 739 985 999 
level 250 basic operations and beginning problem solving 208 
731 960 
level 300 moderately complex procedures and reasoning 06 
159 511 
level 350 multistep problemsolving and algebra 00 04 64 
the average score for 9yearolds tested in 1986 was 2217 for 
13yearolds 269 and for 17yearolds 302 
for white students the average scores for the three ages were 
2269 2736 and 3075 for black students 2016 2492 and 2786 
for hispanics 2054 2543 and 2831 
in separate gradelevel scores asianamerican students trailed 
whites in grade 3 but were far ahead in grades 7 and 11 the 
asianamericans averaged 2113 2886 and 3306

worshipers at trinity episcopal cathedral in 
search of the biblical land of milk and honey need only look to the 
rafters 
at least thats where the honey along with an estimated 50000 
bees is hiding 
the rev john fricke said the bees took up residence in the 
cathedrals rain gutters and under the roof about 10 years ago they 
never caused a problem he said except for the occasional dripping 
of honey down an inside pillar 
but when a contractor said he wouldnt do some needed painting 
because of the bees fricke found himself a beekeeper 
working on a 40foot scaffolding monday roger miller of bellevue 
estimated there is a colony of 50000 bees and the honeycomb 
contains as much as 1000 pounds of honey 
the church had hoped to save the honeycomb and bees miller said 
but the large size and location extending under the roof made it 
impossible 
a scraper pole will be used to break the honeycomb into pieces 
remove it and collect the honey the worker bees will be killed 
using aerosol spray after miller locates and removes the queen

navy crews mistook undersea rocks for 
alien submarines and dropped depth charges on them during recent 
antisub operations a defense staff spokesman said tuesday 
on tuesday the navy using sonar and other tracking gear 
attacked a suspiciouslooking object off the southwestern port of 
goteborg sailors fired charges at another object sunday off 
oxelosund on the baltic east coast said spokesman hg wessberg 
later checks by frogmen showed that the intruders were rocks 
that resembled submarines he said blast damage to the rocks showed 
that the navy was on target 
but investigations of the sea bottoms in six other areas where 
we have used weapons indicate no other explanation than foreign 
underwater activity there wessberg said 
since may 30 sweden has carried out eight operations with mines 
and live ammunition against suspected foreign submarines 
military authorities of this neutral country have reported 
snooping by foreign submarines regularly since a soviet sub ran 
aground outside a naval base in southern sweden in 1981 
no intruders have been caught since then although a government 
commission identified 1982 intruders as soviet submarines and the 
government lodged a diplomatic protest

the first indian soldiers were 
withdrawn from sri lanka on tuesday since india sent more than 
50000 peacekeeping troops to the island 10 months ago 
about 400 soldiers sat crosslegged on a dock in this port city 
waiting to sail home to madras in southern india 
indian officials had said earlier that as many as 3000 indian 
soldiers would be withdrawn this week but citing security reasons 
they declined tuesday to give specific figures 
indian army musicians played martial music on bagpipes as about a 
dozen armored personnel carriers and several jeeps and trucks were 
hoisted aboard an indian freighter 
do not call this a withdrawal but a thinning out of troops 
said sri lankan gen sepala attygalle who attended the ceremony in 
trincomalee 150 miles northeast of the capital of colombo 
the indians first began arriving on july 30 a day after sri 
lanka signed an indianbrokered peace accord aimed at ending the 
civil war in the northeast of the island between tamil rebels and 
the sinhalese buddhists 
many among the sinhalese have opposed the presence of the indian 
troops who they fear may stay on the island 
this is the beginning of the end of suspicions and 
apprehensions about indias intentions on sri lanka said indian 
high commissioner jn dixit the equivalent of ambassador who 
spoke to a news conference in colombo after the ceremony 
lt gen as kalkat the indian commanding officer in sri lanka 
praised his departing men for their sacrifice in helping sri lanka 
restore order in the areas dominated by tamil guerrillas at least 
480 indian soldiers have been killed fighting the rebels 
the latest victim was an indian soldier who died only hours 
before the departure ceremony when a bomb set by the rebels 
exploded as his jeep passed four others were injured 
a sri lankan officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the attack six miles south of trincomalee was intended as a slap 
in the face of the departing indians 
all sri lankans should thank the indians for their services 
and fighting to preserve the independence and unity of this 
country sri lankan president junius r jayewardene told 
parliament on tuesday 
jayewardene said he expected the fighting to end soon in the 
northeast so that elections could be held there for new provincial 
councils 
the peace accord called for the tamils to lay down their arms in 
exchange for the creation of district councils which would allow 
the tamils to take control of their local schools and social 
services 
but elections to choose the councils have not been scheduled in 
the tamildominated areas because of the continued fighting 
government officials have said they hope to hold them by july 
tamils who are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people claim they are discriminated against by 
the sinhalese buddhists 
india became involved because its own 60 million tamils are 
sympathetic to their sri lankan brethren who launched an 
independence campaign on the island in 1983 
the largest and most extreme of the rebel groups the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam rejected the peace accord and continued 
fighting

for 18 years police ignored complaints that one 
of their own regularly beat his wife and children and now his 
oldest child stands accused of shooting his father in revenge an 
attorney said tuesday 
authorities charged henry taylor iii 18 with attempted murder 
in the shooting saturday of policeman henry taylor jr whom a judge 
labeled a time bomb after hearing allegations of abuse 
the teenager woke his father sleeping on a couch and said 
this is for you before blasting him six times with a 25caliber 
pistol authorities said 
taylors wife paula contends that over the last 18 years she 
called the police more than 100 times to complain that her husband 
was abusing her or their four children said chester blair the 
younger taylors attorney 
it was just a regular procedure of her calling the police 
complaining that he was beating her or beating the kids or 
threatening her with a weapon blair alleged 
police did little blair said because there is a tendency for 
them to protect their own 
police have begun an internal investigation into the allegations 
by blair and mrs taylor said department spokeswoman tina vicini 
she said she couldnt respond directly to the allegations 
blair said mrs taylor never went through with filing a formal 
complaint against her husband once when she tried to press 
charges her husband said he would swear out countercharges against 
his wife and their children he said 
so she dropped the charges because she didnt want to put her 
children through being charged for something they didnt have 
anything to do with blair said 
in a domestic dispute the injured party may sign a criminal 
complaint and a court date will be set if the crime is a 
misdemeanor the defendant is held until posting bond if it is a 
felony a states attorney is summoned to interview the complainant 
witnesses and the accused and decide whether to file charges 
taylor 55 was in fair condition tuesday with two gunshot wounds 
in the head and four in the neck said hospital spokeswoman holly 
rea 
police records show that taylor has received psychiatric 
treatment and has been on disability leave because of emotional 
problems blair said ms vicini confirmed that taylor has been on 
disability but said she didnt know why 
the shooting was caused i believe by a batteredson 
syndrome blair said the father would beat up the mother and 
the son who was the oldest of their four children would intercede 
on behalf of the mother 
the father would taunt him and say he was the mothers 
bodyguard and then beat the son 
during a bond hearing monday for the younger taylor blair filed 
a motion in cook county circuit court with examples of the alleged 
abuse by the elder taylor a 32year veteran of the department 
after listening to the allegations associate circuit judge 
michael bolan reduced the sons bond from 500000 to 10000 and 
called the elder taylor an absolute menace to his immediate 
family 
hes a time bomb who goes off and repeatedly goes off the 
judge said 
in the most recent incident blair said taylor threatened to kill 
his wife may 24 with a pistol and then chased his son around the 
yard threatening to kill him after he tried to help his mother 
police took the elder taylors gun but didnt arrest him because 
they considered it a domestic dispute blair said 
when a policeman is called to the home of a fellow officer he 
treats him as a fellow officer and he treats everyone else as an 
outsider blair said so if the officer is accused they listen 
to him instead of the person making the complaint

the federal aviation administration had told 
its inspectors to become more heavily involved in the handson 
surveillance of maintenance on older jetliners agency officials 
said tuesday 
the directive is among a variety of actions planned within the 
agency as a result of a threeday industry conference concluded last 
week on how to assure that aging jetliners are kept in safe 
condition 
the conference grew out of the april 28 accident in which a 
19yearold aloha airlines boeing 737 tore apart during a flight 
causing a 20foot section of the cabin wall and ceiling to separate 
a flight attendant was killed when she was swept from the plane 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said that among other steps resulting 
from last weeks conference on aging aircraft the agency would 
develop ways to improve the sharing within the industry of 
technical information about aging aircraft 
establish additional testing techniques to determine the life of 
a jetliner 
place increased emphasis within the faa on human factor 
aspects of aircraft maintenance and inspection to reduce the 
likelihood that such work is not being done properly 
the faa also plans at some point to examine some commuter 
aircraft for signs of aging buckhorn said

a senate subcommittee following the lead of 
the house approved an energy and water development spending bill 
tuesday that provides no money to begin construction of new water 
projects next year 
the appropriations legislation for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 
1 contains 1805 billion but nothing for new starts by the army 
corps of engineers or the interior departments bureau of 
reclamation 
chairman bennett johnston dla said the appropriations energy 
and water development subcommittee had requests for nearly three 
dozen new dams irrigation systems and harbor improvements but was 
able to hold the line 
if we make any exceptions the dam is broken and the flood 
starts said johnston as his panel voiced its approval of a 
modified version of the 178 billion nonewstarts spending 
package voted by the house last month 
the subcommittee also followed the house line on funding for the 
superconducting super collider the multibilliondollar highenergy 
physics project recommended by the reagan administration 
the panel approved spending 100 million on preliminary research 
for the project but like the house it decreed that non be used to 
begin construction 
were going to buck this decision to the next president 
johnston said if he finds the construction money well go 
ahead with it 
nearly half the senate package 81 billion is earmarked for 
the department of energy for defenserelated nuclear activities 
much of the remaining money would go to continue construction work 
on dozens of water projects and to pay for operation and maintenance 
on hundreds more

attorney general edwin meese iii is considering 
going to the republican national convention despite the political 
embarrassment some republicans say his legal problems are causing 
vice president george bush 
cabinet officers traditionally attend these events and the 
attorney general is prepared to do so justice department 
spokesman patrick korten said tuesday 
korten said meeses tentative schedule calls for him to be 
present for part of the convention with the precise dates of any 
appearance still to be determined 
meese would not stay through the whole gop convention which runs 
from aug 1518 in new orleans 
the attorney general has been the subject of a criminal 
investigation for nearly 13 months the probe focusing on meeses 
involvement with scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion 
iraqi oil pipeline project is about to end and a report to be 
issued soon is expected to raise questions about meeses conduct 
at the attorney generals request meese and bush met privately 
in may and meese promised not to do anything that would jeopardize 
bushs candidacy white house chief of staff howard baker has said 
that meeses legal difficulties could hurt republican prospects of 
holding onto the white house 
some bush aides have made similar public comments although bush 
himself has not 
meanwhile meese was to meet late tuesday afternoon with a group 
of moderate republicans from the house known as the 92 group in 
recent weeks the attorney general has met with conservative 
senators and congressmen telling them he has no intention of 
stepping down at a meeting may 25 at least two conservative house 
members said meeses legal problems were causing political damage to 
the republican party and to bushs presidential campaign 
in another indication that meese plans to remain at the justice 
department korten the newly appointed director of the departments 
public affairs office has hired two aides john allen and timothy 
sullivan to assist him in promoting the attorney generals agenda 
allen is handling special projects for korten while sullivan will 
handle writing duties both aides worked with korten at the office 
of personnel management while sullivan most recently a political 
consultant in manassas va also has worked at the republican 
national committee 
the speechwriting unit at the justice department has been 
without a director since william schambra resigned last month the 
same day that meeses chief spokesman terry eastland said the 
attorney general had fired him for not defending meese aggressively 
enough sullivan will handle some speechwriting duties but the 
position of head of the unit will remain vacant

irans parliament reelected hashemi 
rafsanjani as its speaker on tuesday cementing his political and 
military power parliament voted in a firebrand cleric as 
rafsanjanis deputy 
rafsanjanis reelection to the key position came only five days 
after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini named him commanderinchief of 
the countrys armed forces that appointment followed two serious 
military defeats for iran in the nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia reported that 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose 
credentials had been approved since elections in april and may voted 
for rafsanjani five abstained 
radicals many of them rafsanjani supporters made sweeping gains 
in the elections at the expense of conservatives who have blocked 
economic reforms 
the elction sharpened divisions between radicals who seek a 
centralized staterun economy and the conservatives who are backed 
by the bazaaris the wealthy merchant class 
rafsanjani 53 was named temporary speaker when the parliament 
or majlis convened may 28 pending a twothirds quorum to elect a 
permanent speaker he has been speaker since 1980 
the majlis also elected two deputy speakers tuesday irna 
reported 
one is hojatoleslam mehdi karroubi a middleranking cleric who 
is the militant head of the pilgrimage bureau and believed to have 
been responsible for masterminding riots by iranian pilgrims in the 
holy moslem city of mecca last year hundreds of people died in the 
riots 
the other is hussein hashemian a littleknown deputy from 
rafsanjanis hometown of rafsanjan in southeast iran 
rafsanjanis reelection appeared to set the seal on his 
political power 
he is already khomeinis representative on the supreme defense 
council which determines irans strategy in the war he sits on the 
council for the expediency of state decrees formed earlier this 
year by khomeini to push radical economic reforms through parliament 
rafsanjani also has strong links with the revolutionary guards 
corps which is now more powerful than the iranian army and leader 
of the clerics who deliver sermons at the weekly friday prayer 
sessions in tehran an influential religious and political platform 
rafsanjanis widening power leaves him wellplaced to become the 
kingmaker in the power struggle among irans fractious leadership 
that is expected to swell when khomeini dies 
the 87yearold revolutionary patriarch has been reported in poor 
health speculation that his condition was deteriorating was 
heightened when he relinquished his constitutional position as 
commanderinchief to rafsanjani a middleranking cleric 
there has been no hard evidence to support that but the new york 
times reported that some us officials believe rafsanjanis 
appointment indicated khomeini may no longer be capable or willing 
to continue to run military affairs 
khomeini has designated a senior cleric ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri as his successor 
but montazari is opposed by many leading figures and is widely 
expected to be little more than figurehead for a small group of 
political heavyweights led by the charismatic rafsanjani after 
khomeini dies 
khomeinis appointment of rafsanjani long a close aide as 
military leader underlined that rafsanjani has his confidence and is 
apparently being groomed to hold the reins of power in the critical 
era that will follow khomeinis death 
rafsanjani is also close to khomeinis son and confidant ahmed

the soviet union could launch nucleartipped 
rockets that would threaten to knock out the proposed earlyround 
version of president reagans star wars antimissile system a 
scientific study said tuesday 
the us system also would be threatened by the possibility that 
the enormously complex software needed to run its computers might 
fail the first and only time it would be used the congressional 
office of technology assessment said 
the conclusions are part of a 2yearlong ota study that raises 
new questions about reagans program known formally the strategic 
defense initiative 
the strategic defense initiative organization in a statement 
said the report reflects a decidedly more constructive and 
balanced assessment than previous reports by ota 
but the statement disputed otas comments about computer 
software claiming the study failed to acknowledge the positive 
achievements and the real operating record of such systems as the 
safeguard ballistic missile defense which operated for a 10month 
period early in the last decade 
the ota study was publicly released despite the fact that the 
pentagon had refused to declassify three chapters dealing with ways 
the soviets could counter the american system 
when reagan announced his program in 1983 he proposed that it 
should be aimed at making nuclear weapons obsolete sdi officials 
have been overseeing research into a wide variety of futuristic 
technologies including lasers and beam weapons 
but in the past two years sdi officials and supporters of the 
program have been pushing for a less comprehensive phase one sdi 
system which could be started in the mid1990s the second and third 
phases of such a system would be constructed later 
last year the pentagon told congress that a phase one sdi system 
costing 75 billion to 150 billion could be deployed using a 
combination of groundbased rockets and spacebased rockets that 
would be parked in orbiting garages ready to fire at attacking 
soviet missiles 
but the soviets could attack such a system with antisatellite 
asat rockets using nucleartipped weapons the ota study said the 
soviets now have an operational asat system 
the soviet asats would pose a significant threat to all three 
defense system phases but particularly to the first two ota said 
such weapons deployed in quantity especially with multiple 
decoys to confuse the us system would threaten to degrade 
severely the performance of a first or secondphase sdi system 
the study said 
the study was the second ota report critical of reagans star 
wars plan other scientific reports have also questioned the 
feasibility of sdi goals 
the ota study also raised questions about the software that would 
be used to run the sdi computers other studies have raised 
questions about whether reliable software which would be far more 
complex than anything previously put together can be developed 
thomas h karas director of the ota study said there is a 
significant probability that the software would fail the first 
time it was used in a real situation 
the study noted that the nature of software and experience with 
large complex software systems indicate that there may always be 
irresolvable questions about how dependable the sdi programs 
would be and about the confidence the united states could place in 
dependability estimates 
in addition any attempt to realistically test the software could 
only be done by computer simulation and thus it would also be 
dependent on software karas said 
the study said there are no adequate models for the 
development production test and maintainance of software for 
fullscale missile defense systems 
karas said he didnt understand why public release of the three 
chapters had been refused by the pentagon they were so general that 
the soviets could not likely gain much military advantage from 
reading the material he said 
the study said it was difficult to come up with a precise 
degree of how well the us system could survive a soviet attack 
because that would depend on the tactics employed by each side and 
on the evitable uncertainties of battle 
the democraticcontrolled congress has consistently cut reagans 
requests for sdi spending the program is funded at 39 billion in 
the current fiscal year 
for the 1989 fiscal year beginning oct 1 the senate has voted 
46 billion while the house has approved 35 billion with a

president jose napoleon duarte 
who underwent surgery for stomach cancer tuesday in washington sent 
a message to salvadoran military appealing for unity and respect for 
civilian government 
the message published tuesday by the newspaper prensa grafica 
urges the high comnmand to consider the immense historic 
responsibility that is yours to guarantee the dynamic of the process 
that we are moving forward 
it said the military learned to be historically aware of its 
true role and that conduct should be promoted and maintained so 
pluralistic democracy becomes irreversible in our country and in no 
circumstances is interrupted by actions of force or coups 
coup rumors have circulated since march when duartes christian 
democratic party lost to the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance in national assembly and municipal elections 
he asked the armed forces to remain united because much remains 
to be done in the first place to end the conflict that bleeds our 
country 
more than eight years of war between leftist rebels and 
ussupported governments have devastated an economy once among the 
strongest in central america 
a broadcast tuesday on the rebels clandestine radio venceremos 
said the apparent unity of the armed institution is artificial 
and the contradictions are starting to be demonstrated publicly 
a statement released tuesday by walter reed army medical center 
in washington said duarte 62 underwent surgery to remove cancerous 
tissue from his stomach but doctors left his diseased liver 
untouched 
duarte went to washington on may 31 leaving vice president 
rodolfo castillo claramount in charge

the office that handles final appeals 
for death row inmates told the florida supreme court on tuesday that 
its out of money until the new fiscal year july 1 although it has 
three active death warrants to defend 
i just said im broke said larry spalding capital 
collateral representative in describing his arguments before the 
high court 
spalding said he asked the court for some relief either through 
staying the three warrants until the next budget year or by having 
someone supply his office with additional funds 
the question is what relief can they give us and whose 
responsibility is it spalding said 
carolyn snurkowski an assistant attorney general argued that 
the agency can get through the remaining three weeks of the fiscal 
year without relief 
the high court gave no indication on when it will rule but 
spalding and ms snurkowski expect a speedy decision 
of the three active warrants the office said it has no money to 
defend one is for ernesto suarez whose execution is scheduled june 
22 in the electric chair at florida state prison near starke the 
other two inmates are daniel karr johnson scheduled to die july 7 
and robert ira peede july 8 
the ccrs money woes spalding said are the result of several 
facors including the number of death warrants signed by gov bob 
martinez moving the office into more expensive quarters and the 
large number of hearings and other expenses involved in handling 
death cases 
spalding estimates his office needs 60000 to 70000 to make it 
through the year its total budget is 14 million

congress passed a land reform law 
early wednesday that gives landowners the choice of dividing their 
property among tenants or sharing profits with them 
the bill which goes to president corazon aquino for her 
signature is expected to benefit two million farmers in this 
largely agricultural nation of 7100 islands 
land reform is considered essential to defeating the 19yearold 
communist insurgency which has its main support in rural areas 
all but one of the 19 senators present approved the bill tuesday 
sen vicente paterno a landowner abstained and the other four 
members left before the vote 
the 203member house of representatives passed the measure at 
115 am wednesday by a vote of 15220 with four abstentions 
officials have said the program estimated to cost 70 billion 
will be financed by foreign aid and assets of exiled president 
ferdinand marcos and his allies that were seized on grounds they 
were illegally acquired 
marcos governed the philippines for 20 years but was driven from 
the country in february 1986 by a civilianmilitary uprising that 
brought mrs aquino to power 
a conference committee of the two houses had spent two weeks 
reconciling provisions of the house and senate versions 
sen heherson alvarez a former agrarian reform minister who 
sponsored the legislation said it would bring democratization of 
the means of production 
rep jose cojuangco mrs aquinos younger brother voted in 
favor despite earlier doubts about the measure there are a few 
sections that have to be amended but for the first time this bill 
will really accomplish a genuine land reform he said 
the presidents owns a 14820acre sugar plantation in tarlac 
province north of manila 
rep bonifacio gillego sponsored the original house bill but 
withdrew after changes began he voted against the legislation 
wednesday and told his colleagues they were foisting a grand 
deception on our people 
each landowner may retain 12 acres and an additional seven for 
each direct heir over age 15 who will till the land a landowner 
also has the option of sharing profits or giving tenants shares of 
stock instead of physically dividing the property 
gillego said farmers would oppose the profitsharing option and 
it might result in agrarian reform if you will through a 
revolution leftist farmers groups have said the bill favors 
landowners 
it also provides for the transfer to farm workers of tracts of 
public land greater than 2470 acres now leased to multinational 
corporations 
government lands will be the first distributed in the 10year 
program private holdings of more than 50 hectares 1235 acres 
will be parceled out in the first four years and smaller holdings 
later 
owners of more than 50 hectares will be paid 25 percent of the 
value in cash and those with less than 24 hectares 599 acres will 
be paid 35 percent in cash 
tax exemptions shares of stock in governmentowned or controlled 
corporations or land bank of the philippines bonds will make up the 
rest of the compensation

the governmentcontrolled media still 
attack an opposition rendered voiceless by the closure of four 
newspapers a television station and three radio stations critical 
of gen manuel antonio noriega 
i do not think they will allow the news media to reopen 
winston robles director of the shuttered daily newspaper la prensa 
said of noriegas government they cannot coexist with a free 
press 
how can the government talk of elections next year when there 
is no freedom of the press robles said in a recent interview 
the government has indicated that noriega who was indicted on 
charges of drug trafficking in the united states may run for 
president in the may 1989 election 
the dailies el siglo and extra the weekly quiubo channel 5 
television and radio stations la exitosa kw continente and radio 
mundial also have been closed all are owned by critics of the 
noriegacontrolled government 
the media controlled by the government or sympathetic to noriega 
relentlessly criticize the opposition forces who want to oust the 
general who as head of the nations 15000member defense forces is 
considered the countrys de facto leader 
the governments radio and television station and the three daily 
newspapers who support noriega constantly ridicule opposition 
leaders often describing them as lackeys of the united states 
they also criticize the united states and its allies last week 
the daily la republica said in a headline that president jose 
napoleon duarte of el salvador has cancer because he once kissed an 
american flag 
only la estrella the nations oldest newspaper sometimes gives 
space to opposition comment 
opposition efforts to obtain court orders or get official word 
about reopening have been fruitless 
la prensa was first closed on july 26 it was allowed to reopen 
jan 20 shortly before president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire 
noriega as head of the defense forces delvalle who owns channel 5 
was instead deposed by noriega supporters in the legislative 
assembly 
on feb 25 soldiers who said they were acting on the order of 
a higher authority closed down la prensa again police have since 
guarded the building 
we have no access to our equipment or files in the building 
said robles we cannot find out who ordered the closing down of 
the newspaper what we are accused of or what is going to happen 
the newspaper filed suit against noriega in the supreme court 
holding him responsible for the closure 
but the supreme court rejected the petition late last month 
saying it had no jurisdiction and could not fix blame for the 
closure because the soldiers who shut down la prensa had no written 
orders 
on monday nine officials from the attorney generals office and 
three police officers went to the la prensa building for what they 
described as an investigation they refused to provide any 
details about their inquiry 
ruben dario carles chairman of the board of la prensa said the 
paper will put its case before the interamerican human rights 
commission and appeal for support from the embassies of several 
latin american countries

a fire killed five children and two adults 
tuesday in a secondfloor apartment and the sole door to the home 
was padlocked the fire chief said 
the padlocking violated city fire code chief don lickert said 
adding that six of the victims were found beneath a boarded window 
that also may have prevented their escape he could not immediately 
say if boarded windows broke city codes 
the seventh victim was found in a secondfloor hall lickert said 
butler county coroner dr richard burkhardt ruled the victims 
died of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning three adults 
were injured and hospitalized officials said 
the streetlevel access door for the apartments that burned was 
padlocked from the outside apparently by the residents as a 
security measure lickert said 
lickert said the residents locked and unlocked the door by 
reaching through an adjacent window but apparently couldnt do it 
amid the fire and smoke 
elizabeth blackburn who said she owns the building with her 
husband art said she was unaware of the padlock 
at least one smoke detector should have been in each of the three 
apartments in sleeping rooms plus another in the hall but 
firefighters found only one smoke detector without batteries 
lickert said city inspectors had noted the lack of smoke detectors 
in a previous inspection and blackburn had them installed but 
firefighters could not account for the missing detectors lickert 
said 
the fire chief said the cause of the fire remained under 
investigation the blaze started about 4 am in a living room

chicagos public schools labeled the worst in the 
nation by education secretary william bennett could be the best 
place to try changes that would help students learn bennett said 
tuesday 
there are radical proposals in the air bennett said this 
may be a revolutionary time 
speaking to reporters after the annual meeting of the chicago 
council on foreign relations bennett suggested the 430000pupil 
system consider a voucher plan in which parents could choose schools 
and the government would pick up the tab 
if you tried it tried it honestly and fairly i would predict 
it would improve things dramatically he said 
bennett also said the school systems bureaucracy was the 
blob he called for redistributing power to give parents and local 
school principals more say over curriculum personnel and other 
policies 
last november bennett called chicagos public schools plagued 
by low test scores and high dropout rates the worst in the nation 
and an education meltdown he later accused teachers unions of 
blocking reform 
he said tuesday that his view of chicagos system hasnt changed 
much 
if its not the worst its too close to the worst he 
said 
nearly 45 percent of the students who began school with the class 
of 1985 dropped out before graduating state figures also show that 
half of chicagos public high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent 
of us schools for student scores on the american college test 
but bennett said that whatever comes out of efforts to improve 
the schools may be able to point the way for other school systems 
in the country 
bennett stayed out of a fight in the illinois general assembly 
over a state income tax increase although he said i am not 
convinced that it takes money to change schools for the better 
he said any new state money for education in chicago must be tied 
to a reform package that would shift power in the system 
you must give the people who run your schools the power the 
autonomy to run those schools he said then you must hold them 
accountable for the results 
calling any reform that didnt redistribute power nonsense 
bennett said unions interested only in getting more and more for 
everyone may be hurt in the short run but positive changes in 
schools would help unions in the long run by raising the 
professional esteem of teachers 
bennett visited two chicago schools in march at the request of 
chicago teachers union he said afterward that intransigence of 
special interests such as unions remain the biggest obstacle to 
reform 
jacqueline vaughn president of the chicago union said then that 
cutbacks in government funds were the real culprits

the national gallery of art will celebrate the 
10th anniversary of its modernistic east building with a twoyear 
exhibition of its small but rapidly growing collection of 20th 
century art gallery officials said tuesday 
the show which will open dec 4 will include about 250 works by 
modern artists ranging from pablo picasso to andy warhol it will 
occupy more than half of the buildings 55000 square feet of 
gallery space on three of its five levels 
the new exhibition will demonstrate our progress in expanding 
the gallerys collection of modern art said director j carter 
brown 
about 60 percent of the paintings sculptures and drawings in the 
show will come from the gallerys permanent collection half of 
those were acquired in the decade since the east building opened on 
june 1 1978 the remaining works will be on loan from private 
collections 
curator jack cowart said that although the east building was 
designed in part by architect im pei specifically to house the 
gallerys modern art collection the only permanent exhibition site 
for those works has been on the less visible concourse or basement 
level of the building 
cowart said 20th century art was virtually nonexistent at the 
national gallery until the early 1960s when the gallery received a 
gift of about 100 works of modern art from the chester dale 
collection 
since then he said the gallerys collection has grown steadily 
with the goal of assembling a highquality range of modern masters 
although there is no pretense of matching the vast numbers of new 
yorks museum of modern art or metropolitan museum of art 
we acquire carefully slowly and with great care said 
cowart who estimated that about 90 percent of the gallerys 
acquisitions are gifts rather than purchases 
two major gifts were made in 1986 when the gallery acquired more 
than 900 drawings and 100 paintings by american artist mark rothko 
and the stations of the cross a 15painting series by barnett 
newman 
the gallerys modern paintings sculptures and decorative art 
objects have grown in the past decade from 272 to 613 works 
compared with thousands in other collections our center of 
gravity is the old masters brown conceded 
the exhibition opening in december involving extensive 
remodeling of the east buildings gallery spaces will move 20th 
century art upstairs from the basement to give the collection a 
presence the public can count on cowart said 
the tower and upper levels will feature preworld war ii artists 
such as picasso henri matisse georges braque and amedeo 
modigliani the concourse galleries will highlight the works of 
postwar artists such as warhol newman jackson pollock roy 
lichtenstein and jasper johns 
brown said the exhibition may embark on a national tour once it 
closes at the east building in december 1990

the office of management and budget said 
tuesday that legislation under consideration by the house 
appropriations committee would slash 686 million from funds the 
reagan administration seeks to combat drug abuse 
at a time when various members of congress are calling for 
increased federal drug spending in the face of a drug crisis of 
unparalleled proportions the commerce justice and state 
appropriations bill would actually reduce fiscal 1989 funding 
omb said in a statement 
the budget office complained that the bill would provide 
essentially a freeze on the spending levels for antidrug 
programs administered by the justice department 
it said that instead of approving the 267 billion that reagan 
requested in the budget for the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
the committee proposes appropriating only 198 billion or 686 
million less than was sought 
the bill being marked up by the house appropriations committee 
involves money for the drug enforcement administration the bureau 
of prisons the us marshals office and us attorneys offices 
across the country 
the presidents fy 1989 budget requested sufficient funds to 
preserve the momentum of the federal governments war on drug abuse 
in the three key areas of prevention treatment and law 
enforcement omb said in a statement released at the white house 
should congress provide less than the presidents request 
programs to combat illegal drugs will suffer 
reagan told a us coast guard academy graduating class last 
month that he wanted to see the national drug debate depoliticized 
and he proposed creation of a joint executivelegislative task force 
to recommend solutions 
but no such joint task force has yet been constituted although 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and house minority leader bob 
michel rill have study groups working on legislative proposals 
omb said that under the legislation the house appropriations 
committee is poised to recommend 
there would be no financing of 177 new drug enforcement agents 
and support positions at a cost of 44 million plans for expanded 
intelligence capabilities and equipment including aircraft and 
computer equipment would have to be cancelled 
the government would not be able to carry out a proposal to add 
3400 positions at a cost of 574 million to reinforce the federal 
prison system 
it would be impossible to create 566 additional us attorney 
and support positions in the prosecution force at a cost of 44 
million and the prosecution of major organized crime drug task 
force cases would be out of the question 
there would be no money for the anticipated addition of 161 to 
the staff of the us marshals office at a cost of 24 million 
prisoner transportation and the delivery of drug defendants at trial 
sites would be adversely affected

interest rates on 30year fixedrate home 
mortgages continued to climb in may encouraging americans to turn 
to adjustablerate mortgages the government said tuesday 
the federal home loan bank board the federal regulator of 
savings institutions said the national average for conventional 
singlefamily loans jumped to 1063 percent in early may up from 
1048 percent in early april 
it was the second consecutive monthly increase since peaking at 
1142 percent just before the october stock market crash rates had 
dropped steadily hitting 1033 percent in early march 
the bank board said rates on the most popular type of oneyear 
adjustablerate mortgages those with limits on how much the rate 
can increase also rose but not by as much they increased to 868 
percent in may up from 861 percent a month earlier 
james barth chief economist of the bank board said the 
percentage of mortgages with adjustable rates rose for the first 
time in five months to 53 percent in may up from 49 percent in 
april 
he attributed that to the widening of the spread between the two 
types of loans the gap grew for two months in a row from 169 
percent in march to 195 in may 
a separate weekly report by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
known as freddie mac show continued increases in fixedrate 
mortgages through may it said the average last week was 1058 
percent the same as the previous week but up from 1032 percent 
four weeks before 
freddie mac averages are lower than the bank boards because they 
do not include addon fees known as points which are paid by 
borrowers

the extremeright national front said tuesday it 
will withdraw its candidates from six legislative districts in favor 
of conservatives and asked the centerright coalition to reciprocate 
within hours candidates from the centerright alliance of the 
union for french democracy and rally for the republic withdrew in a 
southern district that includes marseille a national front 
stronghold 
a statement by jeanclaude gaudin udf leader in the national 
assembly said a socialist or communist would be elected unless 
alliance candidates withdrew 
conservative leaders remain divided on whether to deal with the 
national front which is viewed as racist and xenophobic 
the conservatives and president francois mitterrands socialists 
ran almost even in the first round sunday of voting for the 
577member national assembly computer projections favor the 
socialists to win a majority in next weeks runoff because of the 
way support is distributed 
marseille and its region has attracted attention because national 
front voters could swing the results in 14 districts 
a statement by the national front said its candidates would pull 
out in the six districts where they trailed other rightists in the 
first round 
party leader jeanmarie le pen and national front members who 
finished ahead of conservatives in seven races in and around 
marseille will compete in sundays runoff and expect reciprocal 
withdrawals 
if the conservatives do not withdraw in those districts the 
socialist candidates are likely to benefit from the split in the 
conservative vote and win national assembly seats with less than 50 
percent of the vote 
any candidate who won at least 125 percent in the first round 
can compete in the runoff but those without a chance to win 
commonly throw their support to one of the top two finishers 
maurice toga one of the conservative candidates who withdrew 
said he and three others who belong to the rally for the republic 
would not endorse the national front 
our withdrawals are meant only to respect the will of the 
voters and to assure the defeat of the candidates of the left 
wherever possible he said 
former security minister charles pasqua said the reciprocal 
arrangement tuesday was a local and not a national accord 
any alliance between the conservatives and le pens extreme 
right even an unspoken local agreement in marseille could backfire 
in the rest of the country 
michel noir trade minister in the conservative government of 
jacques chirac that resigned after mitterrands reelection may 8 
said a deal with the national front in marseille might save three or 
four seats but cost about 60 elsewhere in france

assailants had a nationalistic motive meaning they were 
palestinian nationalists

the attack on palestinian militants and added i had hoped we 
would not descend to the level of assassination

the principal critic of house speaker jim 
wrights ethics said tuesday that he too has used a member of his 
congressional staff to work on a book he was writing prior to its 
publication 
rep newt gingrich rga who asked the house ethics committee 
last month to investigate wright said he is fairly confident 
that he asked thenadministrative assistant frank gregorsky to 
review his book window of opportunity before it was published 
in 1984 
there is clearly a distinction between using staff on 
legitimate public policy efforts which may include books and 
speeches which i suspect virtually every member of the congress 
does gingrich said in a telephone interview 
we all ask our staffs to critique it to look at it to make 
sure its all right 
matthew cossolotto a former aide to wright said in interviews 
this week that he spent 150 to 200 hours while on the texas 
democrats staff working on wrights book reflections of a public 
man 
house records show that cossolotto also was paid 2078 from 
official congressional accounts to cover his expenses during a 1984 
trip to texas when he oversaw the final editing of the book 
wright has refused to comment on the matter since sunday when he 
defended cossolottos assignment during a telephone interview with 
the washington post he canceled his regular daily news briefing 
tuesday and denied an associated press request for an interview on 
the subject 
cossolottos role in the production of wrights book did not 
become public until after gingrich asked for the ethics committee 
investigation into wrights personal financial dealings 
but the georgia congressman said tuesday he thinks the ethics 
panel also should examine whether wright violated house rules by 
assigning cossolotto to work on the book 
the idea of using 200 hours of having it be your only job 
assignment of charging over 2000 for a trip which a staffer says 
was only for the purpose of going to fort worth in order to write 
the book it seems to me thats clearly wrong he said 
gingrich said gregorskys only role in his own book was reviewing 
the manuscript before it was published he said he wrote the first 
draft himself and the final draft was done with help from his wife 
and a professional writer who was paid by the publisher 
in a related development aides said tuesday that gingrich has 
begun using his role in the ethics campaign against wright to raise 
money for gopac a political action committee that supports 
conservative candidates for state offices 
gingrich who is general chairman of gopac sent a fundraising 
letter june 1 seeking 75 contributions to help us keep the heat 
on the democrats and make the gains we need this november 
the letter also included a postcard for recipients to send to 
rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the house ethics committee 
urging the panel to launch an investigation of wright 
wrights book was the subject of part of gingrichs complaint to 
the ethics committee he asked the panel to investigate reports that 
wright was receiving unusually high royalties of 55 percent for the 
book which was published by a company which received more than 
250000 for services to wrights reelection campaign in 198586 
carlos moore whose company published the book said tuesday that 
it had a press run of 20000 and is sold out he said most copies 
were sold directly by his company for 595 each with wright 
receiving 325 and the company 270 
some copies of the book however were sold to bookstores for 3 
moore said and wright received only 1 per book royalties on those 
in the interview with the post wright responded to reports that 
lobbyists had purchased multiple copies of the book by saying he 
would be glad to have moore provide a list of the purchasers 
but moore said he had no such list available although he 
speculated that very few were sold to bookstores 
if i had to guess how many we sold to bookstores id say 
between 2000 and 3000 he said why take in 3 when i can take 
in 595

three conservatives filed a complaint tuesday 
against independent counsel lawrence e walsh saying the 
irancontra prosecutor may have violated federal criminal law when 
he accepted free legal services from harvard law professor laurence 
tribe 
tribe at walshs behest wrote a brief in support of another 
independent counsel alexia morrison who is seeking to have the 
supreme court reverse a federal appeals court decision which 
declared that independent counsels are unconstitutional 
the criminal complaint filed with the justice departments 
criminal division says walsh may have violated the antideficiency 
act which makes it unlawful for a government employee to accept 
voluntary services from private individuals 
walsh said his office had researched the question and concluded 
there was no violation and that his office was checking with the 
justice department on the matter 
the complaint was filed by three men including f andy messing 
jr executive director of the national defense council foundation 
messing is a conservative activist who worked with fired national 
security council aide oliver l north in attempts to aid the contras 
the complaint asks the justice department to look into the free 
services of tribe and calls for appointment of an independent 
counsel to conduct a criminal investigation 
the maximum penalty for violating the antideficiency act is two 
years imprisonment and a 5000 fine 
the others filing the complaint were kenneth boehm treasurer of 
the conservative campaign fund and peter flaherty chairman of 
citizens for reagan 
we have carefully researched this issue and are satsified that 
there is no violation whatever of the antideficiency act walsh 
said in a statement 
we have communicated this conclusion to the justice department 
which has expressed no disagreement and has sought the views of its 
office of legal counsel walsh added 
the citizens for reagan group issued a statement quoting boehm as 
saying walsh has sought to privatize our judicial process 
flaherty said that one must question the financial 
arrangements in which walsh is allowing senior staff lawyers to 
retain their relationships with private law firms flaherty said 
this has created the potential for huge conflicts of interest 
a spokesman for walsh jim wieghart said a special panel screens 
potential conflicts of interest and that were aware of none 
wieghart said walsh tried to get the most qualified lawyers 
possible for his investigation and acknowledged that some have come 
to work on a parttime basis

a federal judge tuesday ordered the government 
to grant visas to nicaraguas interior minister and three others 
barred from entering the country because of their membership in 
communist or communistaffiliated groups 
us district judge harold h greene reversing an earlier 
finding that had been set aside by a federal appeals court ruled 
that nicaraguan interior minister tomas borge two cuban officials 
and a former italian senator should be admitted to accept speaking 
engagements at the invitation of us citizens 
greene held that the state department had violated the 1952 
immigration and nationality act by denying the four visas simply 
because the applicants were members of communist or 
communistaffiliated organizations 
the law authorizes the state department to exclude aliens if a 
consular official determines they would engage in activities during 
a visit that would be prejudicial to the public interest or 
endanger the safety of citizens 
the state department had invoked the 1952 law saying that visits 
by borge former italian senator nino pasti and cuban officials 
leonor rodriguez lezcano and olga finlay would be prejudicial to 
us interests 
borge had been invited in 1983 to speak by members of congress 
university professors and religious leaders but the state 
department said his presence in the country would be highly 
prejudicial to the foreign policy interests of the united states 
to keep pasti out the government cited his membership in the 
world peace council a group it considered controlled by the soviet 
government and said his speech to a nuclear disarmament rally on 
boston would merely advance soviet interests 
the two cuban women had been delegates to the un commission on 
the statute of women and were invited by new york city to attend a 
conference on the subject 
the american civil liberties union argued that to bar someone 
the law requires the state department to determine that an aliens 
proposed activities during the visit as opposed to political 
affiliations would endanger us interests 
greene originally sided with the governments application of the 
law but a divided panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
reversed his 1984 ruling 
the appellate court finding was upheld last fall on a 33 vote by 
the supreme court which did not issue an opinion 
the appellate panel ordered greene to determine if congress had 
acquiesced to a longstanding state department practice of refusing 
visas to individuals simply because their mere presence in the 
country would hurt national interests 
in the opinion of this court the government has failed in this 
task greene said in tuesdays ruling the court finds that the 
evidence of administrative acquiesence is only imperceptibly more 
weighty than it was when these cases were before the court in 1984 
arthur eisenberg an aclu lawyer in new york who worked on the 
case said greenes ruling means you cant penalize individuals 
for their associational activities for their expression and for 
their ideology 
we believe the statute looked to conduct he said

president najib of afghanistan said tuesday 
more than 34000 soviet soldiers about 30 percent of the total 
have been withdrawn but the pace may be slowed if pakistan continues 
arming afghan insurgents 
if the pakistani side does not end interference in the 
internal affairs of afghanistan from its territory afghanistan 
reserves its right to react to this in a manner warranted najib 
who uses only one name said in a speech to a special general 
assembly session on disarmament 
he did not elaborate in the speech but told a news conference 
later we want to visualize an optimistic situation but should 
such violations acquire a permanent character in such a case we 
would certainly renew our consideration on the schedule of 
withdrawal and take proper reactions together with the soviet 
union 
najib added however that his government intends to meet the 
troop withdrawal schedule set by the geneva agreement with pakistan 
which requires all soviet soldiers to be out within nine months of 
may 15 
in his first speech to the general assembly delivered in the 
dari language najib accused pakistani authorities and afghan 
guerrillas of hindering the voluntary return of afghan refugees to 
their homeland 
such actions are sheer violations of the letter and spirit of 
the geneva accords and an affront to the united nations he said 
they in islamabad will be gravely mistaken should they think 
that only one part of the geneva accords the return of the soviet 
troops will be implemented and the other parties will not live up 
to their commitments najib said 
about 55 million people roughly onethird of the population 
have fled afghanistan in 10 years of civil war more than 3 million 
to pakistan and 2 million to iran 
the unmediated agreement signed april 14 in geneva requires 
the soviets to withdraw the more than 100000 red army soldiers who 
have been helping fight moslem rebels in afghanistan 
soviet officials also have threatened to slow the withdrawal 
in a statement may 28 announcing that 10000 soldiers had left 
afghanistan the soviet foreign ministry said the pullout could slow 
if the united states kept delivering lavish supplies to the 
rebels 
najib spoke to the general assembly disarmament session for 30 
minutes devoting most of his remarks to the situation in 
afghanistan he again called for national reconciliation and 
establishment of a coalition government including opposition forces 
he said the death toll in the war was 243900 soldiers and 
civilians including 35700 women and 20700 children he said 
77700 people have been wounded 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in 
december 1979 
the insurgents were not involved in the geneva negotiations 
leaders of the sevenparty guerrilla coalition have said they would 
ignore the agreement and continue fighting

child an apparent reference to his near drowning at age 5 when his 
brother threw him into the water and then rescued him 
i dont want to go through that again mirecki wrote i 
believe being a rescue swimmer is a great job but not for me 
the evidence was produced during a hearing to determine whether 
five rescueswimmer school instructors and their commanding officer 
should face courtmartial in the death of the 19yearold recruit 
from appleton wis 
testimony ended late tuesday afternoon and closing arguments 
were scheduled wednesday 
other records show that mirecki had been placed on hold for a 
psychological followup examination feb 4 
chief petty officer daniel j conway student control chief at 
the school testified the records were on file and that instructors 
and the officerincharge lt thomas a torchia had access to them 
torchia is charged with dereliction of duty the instructors are 
charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit 
battery they are petty officers 1st class richard e blevins and 
david j smith and petty officers 2nd class john w zelenock 
frankie d deaton and michael w combe 
earlier testimony indicated a flight surgeon had declared mirecki 
medically unfit for the course a month before he died because he was 
suffering from a phobia of being pulled under water he was sent 
back to the school after a clinical psychologist disagreed with the 
diagnosis 
on the day he died mirecki scrambled from the pool and said he 
wanted to quit the course this was during an exercise in which 
instructors acting the part of victims about to drown grabbed 
students in headlocks from which they were supposed to extricate 
themselves and save the victims 
testimony indicates mirecki was forced back into the pool then 
was pried away from a rope in the water and taken to the deep end 
where he collapsed 
a pathologist testified monday that mirecki literally was scared 
to death because of his phobia which triggered heart failure and 
drowning 
other evidence introduced tuesday included a statement by petty 
officer john bilinsky an instructorintraining that defendant 
combe had mirecki in a headlock when the recruit passed out 
im not going to say its incorrect bilinsky said although 
earlier in his testimony he said he had trouble remembering exactly 
what happened

rwis accused the navy of stonewalling in the investigation of 
mireckis death and called upon the navy to release key reports on 
the case 
roth said he will seek to amend an appropriations bill next week 
calling for a study on how the navy can revamp its training to 
improve safety

the justice department on tuesday proposed new 
antitrust guidelines for international operations that generally 
give greater flexibility to us and foreign firms to engage in 
cooperative ventures 
the draft would replace guidelines issued more than a decade ago 
which have become badly outdated due to changes in federal law 
developments in case law and changes in economic thinking said 
charles rule assistant attorney general for the justice 
departments antitrust division 
the 1977 guidelines were very restrictive and hostile to 
intellectual property licensing agreements said rule under the new 
guidelines such agreements wont be challenged unless it is found 
they will drastically raise prices to consumers or unduly restrict 
output 
the 1977 guidelines provided an illdefined analysis for what 
types of joint ventures were permitted said rule who contended 
that the proposal provides a structured approach 
a summary of the draft guidelines says that joint research and 
development technology licensing restrictions and vertical 
nonprice distribution arrangements often are not 
anticompetitive and often substantially benefit us consumers 
the most important thing the new guidelines do is provide 
certainty and clarity in the law which reduces the cost of 
international transactions and increases the competitve ability of 
us firms and ultimately enhances the welfare of us consumers 
rule said 
the proposed guidelines contain 17 hypothetical cases of ways in 
which the new policies would apply 
the new guidelines say the justice departments top enforcement 
priority in the antitrust area internationally remains the 
prosecution of naked cartel arrangements among competitors 
engaging in pricefixing and bidrigging agreements

a car bomb exploded tuesday near a syrian 
military checkpoint in south beirut and touched off fighting between 
syrian troops and proiranian militiamen police said at least six 
people were killed 
the blast in the seaside district of ouzai killed four people and 
wounded 39 including two syrian soldiers and two lebanese 
policemen police said two more people died and another was injured 
in the gunfight 
the explosion occurred at 405 pm about 100 yards from an 
office of the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or party of 
god it was the third car bombing in lebanon this year 
a gray renault loaded with hezbollah gunmen raced to the scene 
after the explosion but dozens of syrian soldiers and lebanese 
policemen surrounding the site stopped the car and ordered its 
occupants out police said 
the syrians and lebanese were manning a nearby syrian military 
checkpoint 
when the gunmen refused to step out troops and policemen tried 
to haul them out by force one gunman fired his pistol and a 
shootout erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilian 
passerby was wounded said a police spokesman he spoke on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations 
syria deployed about 2400 troops in south beirut last month to 
quell fighting between hezbollah and the rival prosyrian shiite 
amal militia for control of the area most of the 18 foreigners 
kidnapped in lebanon are believed held in south beirut 
one of the slain gunmen was identified as abu ali assaf a 
hezbollah official 
reporters and photographers watching from a distance saw troops 
and policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the cars 
open windows before the shooting began 
one gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the officers 
who opened fire with submachine guns panicked onlookers fled 
the brown datsun loaded with 33 pounds of explosives was parked 
outside an automobile repair shop 
the shop owner hussein jammal who was wounded in the blast 
told police the young man who left the car told him he wanted its 
radiator repaired and he would be back to pick it up 
the man walked away minutes afterwards the car exploded and i 
saw blood all over me i looked around for the man but there was no 
trace of him jammal said as policemen helped him into an 
ambulance 
the wail of sirens resounded across the city as victims were 
rushed to hospitals fire engines doused two burning cars with water 
hoses 
debris from four damaged shops was quickly removed by syrian 
soldiers and lebanese policemen so were at least six other wrecked 
cars 
the bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated in 
christian east beiruts rmaeil residential neighborhood killing 20 
people and wounding 78 
that blast raised fears that lebanons moslems and christians 
have launched a new round of car bombings 
the first car bomb in 1988 blew up april 23 in a packed vegetable 
market in lebanons predominantly sunni moslem port city of tripoli 
killing 69 people and wounding 111 
there was no claim of responsibility for any of the three 
bombings but tripoli leaders blamed the explosion in their city on 
the lebanese forces christian militia 
the lebanese forces command denied resonsibility it accused the 
syrian secret service of masterminding the rmaeil car bombing 
the times of london on tuesday quoted shiite and sunni moslem 
sources in beirut as saying that the united states britain and west 
germany have initiated direct contacts with the iranians in an 
effort to free foreign hostages in lebanon

two spectators at a court hearing on conditions 
at a federal prison in kentucky were held tuesday on charges they 
assaulted a us marshal 
the two men believed to be supporters of a prisoner who 
testified at the hearing were arrested after they scuffled with a 
deputy us marshal outside the courtroom of us district judge 
barrington parker according to federal law enforcement authorities 
the incident occurred while parker was conducting a hearing on a 
lawsuit challenging conditions at a highsecurity isolation unit for 
a halfdozen women prisoners at the federal correctional institution 
in lexington ky 
parker had heard testimony about prison conditions from prisoner 
susan rosenberg identified by law enforcement officials as a 
leftwing terrorist who is serving a 58year prison term for 
possessing 600 pounds of weapons and explosives 
ms rosenberg is among seven people recently indicted for placing 
a bomb that exploded in the us capitol in 1983 
one of the two men in police custody following the hallway 
scuffle had refused to stand up when the judge returned from an 
afternoon recess said authorities 
when asked by parker why he had not stood up the man said he did 
not respect the authority of the court 
authorities said deputy us marshal william pickett was jumped 
from behind while escorting the man down a hallway outside parkers 
courtroom 
pickett was then punched by the man he was escorting before he 
and other courthouse guards subdued his attackers authorities said 
the two men identified only as john heild and b wardlaw were 
being held in the city police lockup tuesday night on charges they 
assaulted a marshal said authorities who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
ms rosenberg and two other inmates sylvia brown and silvia 
baraldini charge in the lawsuit brought by the american civil 
liberties union that they are being held in the lexington isolation 
unit because of their political beliefs 
baraldini was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding 
a bungled 16 million robbery of a brinks armored car in nyack 
ny that left a guard and two police officers dead in 1981 
at the unit in lexington guards escort the prisoners to and from 
the locked cellblock prisoners hands and feet are shackled every 
time they leave the unit ms rosenberg said 
ms rosenberg who was in the general populations of two other 
federal prisons said authorities told her she was placed in the 
unit in october 1986 because she was considered a terrorist 
they said i had a oneway ticket she told parker 
the isolation and the control and the dependency has taken away 
any semblance of any kind of selfdetermination about my life ms 
rosenberg said nobody should have that happen to them no matter 
what theyve been convicted of thats punishment on punishment 
i really think that in prison you cant control all aspects of 
your life ms rosenberg said but when you cant control 
anything at any level thats out of your hands the frustration is 
really unbearable 
ms rosenberg said the isolation and strict control by guards has 
inflicted severe emotional and psychological stress 
trying to suppress the anger asks an enormous amount of energy 
an enormous amount of selfcontrol and its making me sick she 
said 
dr william logan a psychiatrist hired by the government to 
inspect the prison testified that he found no evidence that 
conditions had caused any unusual emotional or psychological damage 
but logan said his findings were based only on observations and 
conversations with prison doctors because the prisoners refused to 
talk to him 
federal authorities contend that the extra security is required 
to protect the facility from terrorist attack they said they plan 
to move the unit to a prison in mariana fla in july 
j michael quinlan director of the bureau of prisons in a 1987 
letter to the house judiciary committee denied that inmates are 
sent to the unit because of political beliefs 
but affiliation with groups that use violence in attempts to 
disrupt or overthrow the government of the united states or whose 
published ideology includes advocating law violations in order to 
free prisoners is a factor he said 
last weekend lynette alice squeaky fromme convicted of 
trying to shoot president ford on sept 5 1975 in sacramento 
calif was transferred to the unit last weekend authorities said

a soviet literary journal has taken a new look at 
vladimir i lenin saying the countrys founder tried to enforce 
tough economic policies by ordering executions and other tough 
measures that backfired 
in a 30page article in the may edition of novy mir new world 
vassily selyunin takes a more realistic look at lenins policies 
than the lenincandonowrong approach that has dominated official 
soviet news media for years 
selyunin said that in the first few years after the bolshevik 
revolution in 1917 lenin favored extremely harsh measures for 
putting the economy on track 
the extremes of force as we see spread boundlessly first it 
is undertaken for repression of opponents of the revolution then it 
is turned against potential enemies the red terror and finally it 
becomes a means for solving purely economic tasks selyunin wrote 
selyunin seemed to imply lenin laid the seeds for the abuses of 
power for which his successor josef v stalin has been condemned 
under kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev historians are being 
encouraged to take a more honest look at the countrys past the 
result has been numerous press articles books and films blasting 
stalin who was responsible for the deaths of millions 
gorbachev attacked stalins economic policies under which the 
central government tightly controlled production and allowed little 
individual initiative 
the criticism extended to the era of stagnation under leonid 
i brezhnev who ruled the country from the early 1960s to 1982 but 
criticism of lenin has been offlimits 
the novy mir article says lenin was mistaken when he abolished 
all private property and created a system of forced labor camps 
lenin started to go astray in november 1917 when he declared 
that speculators were enemies of the people who should be 
shot when found according to selyunin speculation meant anything 
outside government trade 
lenin also advocated another harsh measure limiting peasant 
families to only the bread they needed to make it to the next 
harvest selyunin wrote the penalty for violation was a minimum 
10year jail term 
the author says lenin might be excused for some of the measures 
because the country was suffering severe hunger and destruction 
but selyunin wrote the harsh measures actually made the problems 
worse 
in january 1918 lenin supported a decree that increased prison 
space so class enemies could be incarcerated 
but lenin began to realize he was wrong and selyunin quotes him 
as saying the use of force was backfiring in that it was increasing 
civil unrest according to the article 
in march 1921 lenin made a midcourse correction and had a severe 
tax removed from peasants two months later he launched his new 
economic policy which allowed greater freedom in agriculture 
industry and trade 
selyunin credits this program with helping rid the country of 
bureaucracy which gorbachev has said is stifling some of his 
reforms

a jury on tuesday rejected claims by eight 
former residents of times beach that dioxin in the oil sprayed on 
the towns streets had made them ill 
the st louis circuit court jury said after deliberating a day 
there was no medical evidence to support the claims the eight 
represented more than 180 plaintiffs in the 7monthold trial 
times beach a st louis county community of 2400 was 
disincorporated and abandoned five years ago because of dioxin 
contamination 
the eight residents whose claims were decided tuesday had been 
chosen by judge michael j hart as representatives of 184 original 
plaintiffs in a suit filed against four chemical companies over 
alleged damages the suit was one of several filed by times beach 
residents against the companies 
the test trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneys 
on both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short a 
time as possible hart said 
only two of four chemical companies remained as defendants in the 
case earlier this month syntex usa and syntex agribusiness 
reportedly settled the case for 14 million to be divided among 
1230 claimants 
the nowdefunct northeastern pharmaceutical and chemical co and 
independent petrochemical corp were the remaining defendants 
an attorney for the plaintiffs arnold j levin said a decision 
on whether to appeal tuesdays decision had not yet been made he 
said he would ask the court to allow him to choose eight new 
plaintiffs from the original 184 who would more clearly exhibit the 
injuries and property losses he said times beach residents suffered 
from the contamination 
but defense attorneys expressed confidence that none of the 
plaintiffs had illnesses that could be traced to dioxin 
they can pick the eight worst seven or eight people from 
times beach who happen to have cancer and im confident that well 
be able to prove that its in no way connected to dioxin said ted 
parryman an attorney for northeastern pharmaceutical and chemical 
syntex and its predecessor hoffman taff made a herbicide known 
as agent orange at a plant in verona in southwestern missouri 
dioxin is a waste product of agent orange which was used as a 
defoliate in vietnam syntex later transferred tanks purportedly 
containing the waste material to northeastern pharmaceutical 
northeastern made hexachlorophene for soaps and toothpaste at the 
verona site with dioxin a waste product of that chemical as well 
attorneys for the plaintiffs said northeastern passed the waste 
on to independent petrochemical which passed it on to russell 
bliss the waste hauler who sprayed oil containing the dioxin on the 
streets in times beach more than 15 years ago to keep the dust down 
bliss was not a defendant 
the extent of the contamination in times beach was determined in 
1982 leading the government to close the city the next year and 
relocate its residents

the space agency anticipates strong competition 
from prospective manufacturers of the next generation of shuttle 
rockets despite a decision by morton thiokol the sole builder of 
current solidfuel boosters to pull out of the running a spokesman 
said tuesday 
chicagobased morton thiokol says it will concentrate on 
redesign for shortterm use of the rocket booster used on 
challenger which exploded shortly after takeoff jan 28 1986 
killing all seven astronauts aboard 
according to a presidential commission the fiery disaster was 
caused by hot gas that leaked through a joint in a thiokolbuilt 
solidfuel booster igniting the shuttles main fuel tank 
thiokol may have pulled out of the competition for the 12 
billion contract to design and build rocket boosters for the 1990s 
but national aeronautics and space administration officials believe 
other companies still will be interested 
were going ahead with this project we do expect strong 
competition for the contract said jerry berg nasa spokesman at 
the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala the center 
that oversees the space agencys rocket work 
meanwhile we look forward to our association with morton 
thiokol on the current booster berg said 
nasa plans to use thiokols redesigned motor when it resumes 
shuttle flights the first planned for late august the redesign is 
nearly complete with a test firing set for next month at cape 
canaveral fla said rocky raab a thiokol spokesman in utah 
raab said monday that united technologies a team of lockheed and 
aerojet and another team consisting of hercules atlantic research 
corp and martin marietta have expressed an interest in the 12 
billion contract 
tom fitzgerald spokesman for aerojet in sacramento calif said 
tuesday he was surprised by thiokols announcement to pull out but 
said the news was good for thiokols competitors 
any time your field of competitors lessens by one your chances 
improve obviously fitzgerald said and yes we are interested 
its going to be a competitive contract he added 
thiokol is a very strong competitor but as to who is the best 
competitor its a tough one to say 
berg meanwhile said he could not speculate what impact 
thiokols announcement might have on the competition for the 
nextgeneration version of shuttle boosters the advanced solid 
rocket motor except to say the space agency plans on strong 
competition for the project 
nasa plans to release its formal request for final industry 
proposal for the advance rocket later this month berg said 
nasa plans to begin phasing in the advanced rocket in 1994 and 
that process is expected to take about four years meaning morton 
thiokol will still be involved in providing the current shuttle 
rockets for years berg said 
in addition thiokol plans to invest 200 million in coming years 
to modernize its northern utah plant in order to seek other space 
and defense business raab said the company which makes and sells 
chemicals rockets and salt intends to go after the air force 
advanced launch system a strapon booster and other contracts he 
said

prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
will hold his first meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze on thursday an israeli spokeswoman said 
genine stauber said no exact time and place for the meeting had 
been set 
the soviet union broke diplomatic relations after the 1967 middle 
east war but appears to be departing from its policy of not 
restoring them until the israelis give up arab territories occupied 
in the war 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev has indicated in recent 
speeches that the soviet union might resume normal relations after 
an international peace conference on the middle east is convened 
shamir leads the rightwing likud bloc and opposes trading 
occupied territory for peace he also rejects proposals for an 
international conference including the five permanent members of the 
un security council the soviet union united states china 
britain and france 
those two points are the basis of a us peace plan for the 
middle east which secretary of george p shultz has been promoting 
in the region 
on monday shamir said israel will not offer political 
concessions for resumption of diplomatic relations with moscow 
he and shevardnadze are in new york to address the 159member 
un general assemblys special session on disarmament which began 
last week and is to run until june 25 their governments have had 
recent diplomatic contacts at lower levels 
at tuesdays disarmament session shamir called on israels 
neighbors to agree to ban nuclear and chemical weapons from the 
middle east but said israel will not sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
many delegates from arab and developing nations left the hall as 
shamir walked to the podium 
as early as 1980 we proposed at the general assembly of the 
united nations the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree zone in 
the middle east based on free and direct negotiations between the 
states of the region 
we did so in addition to our repeated declaration that israel 
would not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the 
middle east he added 
israel refuses to say if it has nuclear weapons or the components 
to assemble them 
a former israeli nuclear technician mordechai vanunu was 
sentenced to prison in israel for providing photographs of an 
israeli nuclear facility to the times of london the newspaper hired 
scientists who said the photographs showed israel had the capacity 
to make nuclear weapons 
israel does not allow international inspection of its nuclear 
plants a requirement of the nonproliferation treaty 
many have urged us to sign the nonproliferation treaty said 
shamir but we have seen that this treaty has in no way prevented 
wars between its signatories we have repeatedly invited the 
arab states to negotiate the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone but they have rejected the idea they have refused to 
negotiate with us 
he condemned the use of chemical weapons and poison gas in the 
iraniraq war singling out iraq by its own admission iraq has 
used this vicious means of indiscriminate killing in its war with 
iran it is a gross and blatant violation of the geneva protocol to 
which iraq is a signatory 
delegates from iran or iraq walked out before shamir began 
speaking 
shamir also called for the reduction of conventional forces in 
the region 
he decried the introduction of mediumrange missiles in the 
middle east by iraq iran and saudi arabia 
shamir was one of about 25 presidents and prime ministers due to 
address the special session on disarmament which opened last week 
and is expected to end june 25

panama on tuesday accused the united states 
of trying to nullify the treaties restoring panamanian sovereignty 
over the canal zone by the year 2000 
panamanian ambassador jorge eduardo ritter speaking before the 
un general assemblys special session on disarmament cited a 
gigantic campaign of aggression unleashed by the government of the 
united states against panama 
ritter claimed the us national security council prepared a plan 
to destabilize the panamanian government and thus open a way to 
legally abrogate the canal treaties 
ritter said the alleged plan was drafted april 8 1986 but he 
did not reveal any details on how the panamanian goverment was 
informed about its existence 
the us government has used economic sanctions to try to force 
panamanian gen manuel noriega from power noriega who is indicted 
in florida on cocaine trafficking charges is head of the 
15000member defense forces and de facto ruler of the country 
max l friedersdorf a us representative protested the 
panamanian statement in the general assembly 
my delegation must protest the attempt by the representative of 
panama to confuse this session and waste this bodys valuable time 
with inaccurate and unnecessary attacks against the united states

session and representative to arms control talks 
the people of panama and the united states have long enjoyed a 
close friendship and working relationship he said the 
government and people of the united states sympathize with those 
panamanians who are attempting to restore genuine civilian democracy 
to panama 
the united states recognizes however that it will not be easy 
for them to reverse two decades of military control in panama the

a federal drug agent pleaded with his mexican 
abductors to stop beating him during interrogation before he was 
murdered according to transcripts of tape recordings filed in 
federal court 
transcripts of two tapes obtained by mexican authorites from the 
home of reputed drug kingpin ernesto fonsecacarrillo were filed 
monday in us district court as part of the prosecution of three of 
the nine men indicted in the murder of enrique camarena 
camarena a us drug enforcement administration agent was 
kidnaped feb 7 1985 as he left the us consulate in guadalajara 
several weeks later his body and that of his pilot alfredo 
zavalaavelar who was kidnapped separately were found on a remote 
ranch 70 miles away camarena had been severely beaten 
us officials have said camarena was kidnapped shortly after he 
and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking operation run by 
rafael caroquintero who along with fonsecacarrillo was one of 
mexicos biggest drug kingpins 
camarena moans and complains of pains and injuries on the tapes 
federal prosecutors say they believe the recorder was turned off 
during beatings 
the agent says at one point that he has sharp pains all over 
his body and asks his captors couldnt i ask you to have my ribs 
bandaged please 
affidavits about autopsy reports which also were filed state 
that camarenas jaw was broken in several places and his head was 
shattered like an eggshell 
according to documents filed in court federal prosecutors 
believe that sergio espinoverdin a former mexican police sergeant 
interrogated camarena for two days at a large estate owned by 
fonsecacarrillo outside guadalajara 
prosecutors said the voices of espinoverdin and caroquintero 
have been identified on the tape 
the transcript reveals that camarena told his captors the dea 
knew the whereabouts of fonsecacarrillo and caroquintero but that 
us agents in guadalajara were not allowed to carry weapons and so 
didnt conduct surveillance of the two men 
to conduct surveillance over there at the house i have never 
sir i am afraid camarena said 
i did not want trouble i just wanted to get out of here he 
said referring to his transfer back to the united states that was 
pending at the time 
camarena may have been attempting to mislead his abductors by 
asserting that agents dont carry guns said ralph lockridge a dea 
spokesman in los angeles local commanders can authorize agents to 
carry weapons he said 
he was just throwing out something that was wrong lockridge 
said 
camarena mentions confidential information at times indicating 
that the tapes are authentic according to affidavits of dea agents 
who worked with him that information includes a reference to 
complaints about the guadalajara office from dea headquarters 
im telling you that we are being reprimanded from washington 
because according to them we are not working here camarena 
says as i say well who is going to do the work if they have one 
unarmed 
camarena gave only skimpy information about dea informants 
causing the interrogator to snap who is it that put the finger on 
rafael dont tell me about your problems speak of the information 
you can give us you can provide us to finish with this bunch of 
jerks 
yes sir what more can i tell you sir camarena says in a 
voice described in the transcript as very weak 
defense motions have challenged the validity of the tapes saying 
they contain an unexplained burst of music and clicking sounds that 
suggest tampering or fabrication 
raul lopezalvarez 28 jesus felixgutierrez 38 and rene 
martin verdugourquidez 36 are scheduled to go on trial in 
district court here later this month all have denied involvement in 
the camarena case 
caroquintero and fonsecacarrillo are in custody in mexico city 
and extradition proceedings are stalled the other indicted men are 
not in custody

the dallas times herald a daily in one of the 
nations most competitive newspaper cities is being sold for the 
second time in a year and a half 
medianews holdings inc controlled by times herald chairman 
william dean singleton plans to sell the paper to dth media inc a 
new corporation controlled by medianews stockholder john buzzetta 
both parties said 
rumors had been circulating for weeks about the pending sale of 
the times herald which has had marginal profits in the face of a 
weak state economy and tough competition from the larger newspaper 
the dallas morning news 
buzzetta 38 has been associated with singleton 37 since 1977 
buzzetta is president and majority stockholder in the scrantonian 
tribune of scranton pa 
singleton and a partner richard b scudder acquired the times 
herald the secondlargest paper in dallas in late 1986 for 110 
million from times mirror co as part of the deal they received 7 
million that the newspaper had in the bank as well as a 20 million 
discount for paying early to bring their total cost to 83 million 
singleton who was in denver tuesday in meetings at the denver 
post which he also owns said in a statement that proceeds from the 
transaction will go toward retiring debt and for new acquisitions 
the sale comes as the young entrepreneur has extended himself 
financially to purchase the houston post the gloucester county 
times in woodbury nj and todays sunbeam in salem nj which 
he owns through medianews holdings a holding company under media 
news group media news group includes garden state newspapers which 
owns 16 mediumsized dailies 
specific terms of the dallas deal were not disclosed but 
buzzetta said a substantial amount of cash and stock was involved 
in the transaction 
buzzetta said dth media inc will have a controlling interest 
while medianews will retain a financial interest in the newspaper 
and will remain a stockholder 
the dallas times herald is currently showing a healthy annual 
operating profit buzzetta said in a statement 
were buying a winner and we intend to operate the dallas times 
herald in the proud tradition that has kept it successful for more 
than 100 years he said 
buzzetta said no layoffs are planned in the times herald newsroom 
in his statement buzzetta said he would become publisher of the 
newspaper and art wible publisher since 1985 has agreed to leave 
three times herald executives editor dave burgin executive vice 
president and general manager robert hollingsworth and senior vice 
president and chief financial officer richard l jacobs will join 
medianews group 
singleton said in his statement the proposal was attractive 
enough financially that it had to be considered seriously 
earlier reports said singleton was negotiating to sell the paper 
for 140 million 
two weeks ago the dallas morning news and the dallas times 
herald agreed to drop lawsuits filed against each other concerning 
paid circulation figures 
latest figures released through the audit bureau of circulation 
for the six months ended sept 30 1986 showed the times heralds 
daily circulation was 246370 and the morning news was 390987 on 
sunday the times heralds reported paid circulation was 338963 
and the morning news reported 531417 
the next abc report for the period ending march 31 1988 is 
expected in late summer 
newspaper industry analysts said resolving the circulation 
dispute was integral to a sale of the times herald 
i dont think youd buy a newspaper without having circulation 
figures resolved said john reidy of drexel burnham lambert inc 
in new york this way you dont have two guys suing each other and 
confusing the advertisers

the white house aids commission gave its 
tentative endorsement tuesday night to the bulk of the 579 
recommendations the panels chairman wants to put in a report to 
president reagan later this month 
in releasing his recommendations last week retired navy adm 
james d watkins portrayed most of them as reflecting what he read 
as the consensus of the 13member committee 
that turned out to be true during an 11hour meeting as the 
commissioners worked through the report pagebypage making only 
minor changes in wording and organization 
watkins had predicted correctly that his final chapter calling 
for legislation to vest sweeping new powers in the surgeon general 
currently dr c everett koop would prove controversial 
watkins said reagan should immediately proclaim aids a national 
emergency as soon as legislation is passed setting up a new 
framework within the government health bureaucracy to put the 
surgeon general in charge of dealing with it 
although the commission did not reject watkins suggestions 
outright there was a sharp exchange of differences between the 
chairman and commissioner william b walsh and it was clear watkins 
does not have the broad backing of the panel on his proposed shift 
of power to the surgeon general 
the issue of what if anything to recommend in the way of 
administrative changes to deal with aids as well as future epidemics 
was left up in the air with the commissioners agreeing to submit 
their thoughts in writing for the panels staff to synthesize and 
present for further consideration at the final working session next 
thursday and friday 
the final report is due june 24 at the white house and it became 
clear after tuesdays session that it will essentially track 
watkins recommendations including his call for strong federal 
legislation to protect people with the aids virus from 
discrimination 
watkins told fellow commissioners he has received letters from 
both sides of the aisle that leads him to believe there is a 
feeling of momentum in congress for passage of such legislation 
despite administration opposition 
it is something that can be done in this session of congress 
he said i dont know that it will be 
walsh had expressed some concern about the antidiscrimination 
recommendation in early discussions saying it would not be 
fruitful and would not be fair to make a specific recommendation 
about aids discrimination 
if were going to make it we should expand it to cover not 
just aids but all diseases said walsh the director of project 
hope a private international health delivery organization 
however other commissioners noted that the recommendation is for 
a law that spells out that people with the aids virus are to be 
treated just like people with any other handicapping disease no 
worse no better 
watkins said the antidiscrimination recommendation should be the 
no 1 priority in the final reports introductory chapter 
among the other watkins recommendations the panel agreed to 
emphasize at the forefront of the final report 
that all of those infected with the aids virus an estimated 
15 million americans compared with fewer than 70000 actually 
diagnosed with the fullblown illness should be considered part of 
the epidemic 
that intravenous drug abuse is a national emergency that must be 
successfully dealt with if the aids epidemic is to be curtailed 
that the fight against the disease will require resources of 
private as well as government resources 
that compassion for those with aids should be empasized at all 
levels 
tuesdays marathon session was designed to reach as much 
consensus as possible any lingering differences over final wording 
will be resolved by votes if necessary at next weeks sessions 
watkins assured panel members there would be ample time for 
debate promising to run the planned thursdayfriday session into 
the weekend if necessary 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus most 
often is spread through close contact with blood blood products or 
semen from infected persons its chief victims have been homosexual 
men and intravenous drug users 
as of june 6 aids had been diagnosed in 64506 americans of 
whom more than half or 36255 have died since june 1981 according 
to the federal centers for disease control no one is known to have 
recovered from aids

an appeals court reversed itself tuesday and 
ordered philadelphia to release hundreds of inmates from its 
overcrowded prisons within 24 hours 
the district attorneys office predicted dire consequences 
saying prosecution will slacken and criminals will grow bold knowing 
they face little chance of going to jail 
you are going to have whole classes of people who cant be put 
in prison said sarah vandenbraak an attorney representing the 
district attorneys office ninetynine percent of the drug 
dealers we prosecute wont get in prison not even the major drug 
dealers 
the order from the 3rd us circuit court of appeals forces the 
city to free prisoners awaiting trial by paying bail of up to 250 
to reach a ceiling of 3750 imates as of saturday 4059 were 
housed in the citys four jails 
if a threat to exceed the cap exists authorities also will be 
unable to imprison any criminals but those charged with the most 
serious crimes 
sarah vandenbraak an attorney representing the district 
attorneys office said the result will be the city footing the bill 
to put dangerous criminals back on the street 
once people realize they cant be put in prison theyre not 
going to put up the bail for themselves ms vandenbraak said 
do you think anybody in these categories is going to be putting up 
bail 
the appeals court on monday blocked us district judge norma 
shapiros order imposing the limit and the moratorium on prison 
admissions beginning at midnight 
the order was based on a consent decree the city signed in 1986 
and had agreed to fulfill a year ago the decree resulted from a 
classaction lawsuit inmates filed in 1982 challenging prison 
conditions 
the original stay was requested by district attorney ronald 
castille who said he needed time to prepare a formal appeal of 
shapiros moratorium 
after the threemember appeals court issued a onesentence 
reversal tuesday ms shapiro modified her order giving the city 
until 5 pm wednesday to meet the cap and to restrict admissions 
ms vandenbraak said the city will not take further legal action 
until a hearing already scheduled on june 22

the sandinista government and 
usbacked rebels held daylong talks tuesday on a government 
proposal for democratic reform in exchange for rebel disarmament 
the fourth round of peace talks resumed tuesday in a climate of 
mutual distrust but both sides said they might be nearing agreement 
after more than six years of war 
information minister manuel espinoza reported after the talks 
adjourned at 7 pm 5 pm edt tuesday until 9 am wednesday 
we have made substantial advances 
a representative of the leftist government who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said earlier that the government proposal 
bows to almost all the rebel demands for democratic reforms 
the rebels known as contras described the proposal as vague but 
said it raised hopes for an agreement 
contra negotiator alfredo cesar said the nicaraguan resistance 
is here with a political decision to sign a definite agreement for 
permanent and lasting peace in nicaragua if the government shows its 
political commitment to make the democratic reforms in this country 
to achieve that lasting peace 
the resistance is the contras umbrella organization 
bosco mamatoros spokesman for the rebels told reporters after 
the meeting ended there were advances in the discussion on themes 
of a substantial character but said political reform remained 
the biggest problem in the discussions 
he charged that the government was using the dialogue to gain 
time they have to demonstrate the opposite to us 
the talks are taking place amid a temporary truce enacted march 
21 the rebels have extended the truce until thursday and the 
government has declared a unilateral ceasefire until the end of 
june each side accuses the other of violations 
the government proposal promises press freedom the right to 
strike electoral reforms an end to sandinista control of the army 
and freedom for political prisoners 
the proposal offers the contras a role in talks begun late last 
year with opposition political parties the socalled national 
dialogue has made little headway on april 26 the opposition 
parties suspended the talks pending settlement of a workers strike 
the scars and bitterness of the civil war were dramatized tuesday 
in dramatic fullpage ads by the mothers committee of heroes and 
martyrs in the two progovernment newspapers the committee is 
comprised of mothers whose children have died in the war 
the ad in the barricada newspaper showed pictures of wounded 
children along with rebel commander col enrique bermudez we 
dont want amnesty for criminals it said 
the ad in el nuevo diario showed women carrying a coffin a child 
leaning on a cross and a bulletriddled body we wont forget 
it said our pain calls for justice 
the sandinistas have called for disarmament of the rebels to be 
completed by september while the contras have proposed january the 
contras say they will not lay down arms until the nation of 3 
million people is a democracy the sandinistas say it already is 
vice president sergio ramirez said monday night the contras 
should accept the sandinista proposals because at best within a 
month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more 
us military aid to the rebels ended on feb 26 three weeks 
later the rebels signed a temporary ceasefire and began talks on a 
permanent peace with the sandinistas the contras are also plagued 
by deep divisions within their ranks 
the sandinistas who get military and economic aid from the 
soviet bloc also have compelling reasons for ending a war that has 
claimed 26000 lives 
the nicaraguan economy is a shambles and the government faces 
widespread public dissatisfaction over chronic shortages and its 
failure to deliver on promises made when it took power in july 1979 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
expressed hope that the talks would be productive and that the 
sandinistas would negotiate in good faith 
the key issue is the sandinistas willingness to democratize 
ms oakley said were hopeful but we note that in recent weeks 
the sandinistas have increased repression of the internal 
opposition

despite missing several weeks of school 
because of suspensions three street preaching children were 
promoted to the next grade their father said tuesday 
the strode children duffey matthew and pepper were suspended 
numerous times because they refused to proceed into the eastfield 
elementary school building when they arrived on school property each 
morning instead the three children began preaching marion nc 
school officials have stressed that the suspensions resulted not 
from the preaching but from failure to adhere to school rules 
their father david strode said in a telephone interview that 
mcdowell county school officials notified him tuesday afternoon that 
his children had passed matthew will be in the first grade pepper 
moves to the second grade and duffey will go to the sixth grade 
the children took comprehensive tests to complete the school 
year school officials would not release the test results nor would 
they say whether the children were promoted to their respective next 
grades 
strode who is building a house in another school district said 
the preaching will stop if the local schools end their teaching of 
the theory of evolution 
we dont think people who think jesus christ was a liar should 
be teaching our children in our schools unless people have 
liberties the other way he said 
meanwhile residents of marion are circulating a petition asking 
strode to either keep his children from preaching in the schoolyard 
or to leave the town 
if youre going to be a preacher public opinion cant bother 
you strode said

a woman sentenced to jail for refusing to testify 
about her daughters claim that she was the victim of a racist 
attack will seek sanctuary in a church and dare authorities to 
arrest her there her lawyers said tuesday 
the question would be whether this government can respect the 
right of the black church because if it cannot we are prepared 
tomorrow and the day after that to put our lives on the line said 
attorney alton maddox jr 
before you put a hand on glenda brawley you will come through 
me please have a bullet designated for me he said 
mrs brawleys daughter tawana 16 has said she was abducted and 
assaulted last november in wappingers falls 95 miles north of new 
york city by six white men including one who flashed a policelike 
badge 
but she and her family have refused to cooperate with 
investigators claiming local and state officials are engaged in a 
racially motivated coverup 
mrs brawley 33 was sentenced to 30 days in jail monday for 
defying a grand jury subpoena to testify but upon the urging of 
state attorney general robert abrams she was given one more chance 
an opportunity wednesday to tell a judge why she had refused to 
cooperate 
but maddox insisted at a news conference that mrs brawley would 
not appear wednesday 
glenda brawley will be seeking relief before a higher 
authority she will be putting her life in gods hands he said 
neither maddox nor others at the news conference would say what 
church would offer mrs brawley asylum they insisted authorities 
had no right to enter a church to arrest her 
but sgt john clifford a spokesman for the new york police 
department said the decision to arrest people who request sanctuary 
privileges is decided on a casebycase basis theres no hard and 
fast rule he said 
police are allowed to arrest suspects who run into a church the 
spokesman said however if the suspect requests refuge and is 
granted sanctuary by the pastor police have to obtain a search 
warrant to make an arrest or negotiate with the parties involved 
clifford said 
attorney c vernon mason reiterated the theme of the brawleys and 
their advisers it is clear we cannot get justice for tawana 
brawley 
he said authorities had done everything possible to blame the 
victim even more how ludicrous it is for the nation to see that the 
only person arrested in this case is the mother of a black rape 
victim people should be outraged 
miss brawley was found nov 28 four days after she had 
disappeared she was lying dazed in a plastic bag in a road in 
wappingers falls her hair had been shorn animal excrement had been 
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her 
torso 
abrams said unless miss brawleys family cooperates soon the 
states investigation into the incident will end without resolution

morton thiokol sole manufacturer of solidfuel 
space shuttle boosters blamed for the challenger disaster has 
dropped out of the competition for a 12 billion contract to make 
boosters for the 1990s 
the chicagobased company announced monday that it wants to 
concentrate on redesigning the booster used on challenger whose 
fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven 
astronauts aboard 
a presidential commission blamed the jan 28 1986 explosion on 
a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a thiokolbuilt 
solidfuel booster igniting the main fuel tank 
the motor redesign is almost complete with a test firing set for 
next month at cape canaveral fla said rocky raab a company 
spokesman in utah 
thiokols utah plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle 
boosters and the national aeronautics and space admininistration 
must look elsewhere for producers of the nextgeneration version 
the advanced solid rocket motor

the nations 17yearold students are dismal at 
math with only half able to cope with problems usually taught in 
junior high school a testing agency reported today 
the federally sponsored national assessment of educational 
progress also said that nearly 27 percent of 13yearolds are 
lacking in basic computational skills 
more than a quarter of the 17yearolds reported that they did 
not usually understand what was talked about in mathematics class 
and only 6 percent could solve problems that took several steps or 
involved algebra or geometry 
the agency reported the results of tests it gave nearly 15000 
students ages 9 13 and 17 in 198586 as well as comparative data 
from math assessments in 1973 1978 and 1982 
the report the mathematics report card are we measuring up 
said all three age groups improved recently but mostly on lowlevel 
skills and the 17yearolds still have not regained all the ground 
they lost in the 1970s

as a 22yearold army nurse jacque navarra rhoads 
tended the casualties of war amid the monsoons mud and gunfire of 
vietnam seeing both death and the enemy facetoface 
though she defied the odds to save the wounded and held the hands 
of the dying who clung to her alone and frightened no trumpets 
sounded for her or the 10000 other women who served in vietnam 
eight of whom gave their lives 
i just dont think people really understand what we did 
there said mrs rhoads 39 
of the dozens of vietnam movies and television shows none was 
about women until this spring when abc launched china beach a 
vietnam war series centered on combat nurse colleen mcmurphy played 
by dana delany and four other women with representative roles in 
the war 
the final episode of the season airs tonight the show has been 
renewed for the fall after a sevenweek run that brought good 
ratings and critical praise 
mrs rhoads who coedited the book nurses in vietnam the 
forgotten veterans believes the show is realistic 
scenes in which mcmurphys hootch is blown up and she has to care 
for a viet cong woman who killed an american soldier with a grenade 
bring back all too familiar memories 
i feel what that nurse was doing was what i was doing that was 
me she said 
but some female veterans complain the show stereotypes women in 
vietnam as prostitutes bimbos and manhunters among other things 
at the same time they do agree it has redeeming value in making 
mass audiences aware that women served in vietnam 
peggy perri 42 a vietnam combat nurse who now works for the 
william joiner center for the study of war and social consequences 
at the university of massachusettsboston finds the show demeaning 
ms perri was one of 75 women who signed a recent petition 
protesting the way china beach portrays women the petition 
circulated at the second national conference on women and the 
military held at the joiner center was sent to abc 
i feel insulted ms perri said objecting in particular to a 
scene in which mcmurphy dons a sequined miniskirt and joins singer 
laurette barber played by chloe webb onstage at a uso club 
another sore spot for ms perri and other veterans is the character 
of kc a prostitute 
ms perri was unable to talk about her experiences in vietnam 
until three years ago even though she had left 20 years ago 
i was unable to deal with the stereotypes that people had about 
women who were in vietnam she said this show validates those 
stereotypes the thing that is unrealistic is all this emphasis 
these women characters as sexual beings 
cherie rankin a 41yearold norwood mass social worker who 
was with the american red cross in vietnam says her counterpart in 
china beach is so naive she never seems able to understand what 
is going on 
i remember ms rankin said being overwhelmed by the 
numbers of men and what was happening to them the deaths and 
injuries the thousandyard stares the guys who after a short 
period of time looked like there was nobody at home when you looked 
into their eyes they were very old men in young bodies 
tired of having to smile and be friendly on the job tired of 
being gawked at she isolated herself in her hootch in the few 
offduty hours she had 
its not a documentary so we will from time to time bend 
things to fit dramatic purpose said william broyles jr 
cocreator of the show and himself a vietnam veteran broyles said 
female vets serve as consultants on the show and the producers have 
gone to great pains to make the characters costumes and stories 
realistic 
but was the vietnam war itself real given the contradictions and 
the contrasts where else could you have a front row seat to the 
drama of war sitting on rooftop terraces sipping scotch and water 
watching flares light up the night skies and listening to the rumble 
of bombs and the ratatat of machinegun fire 
i never had a sexual relationship over there rhoads writes 
in her book dating well youd walk around bunkers and talk 
about home youd bring a bottle of wine and hed bring the 
glasses youd sit and watch the b52s bomb across the dmz 
the sky would light up in different colors and youd sit and watch 
the fireworks it sounds strange watching somebodys village 
get blown up we didnt want to think about the lives being lost 
editors note george esper covered the vietnam war for the 
associated press for 10 years

when patricia morison first met cole porter in 
1947 she sang a rodgers and hammerstein song for him 
i thought it was safer she says with a laugh porter must 
have liked what he heard from the young actress who at the time was 
not known as a singer 
he gave me the score for something called kiss me kate and 
told me to learn it miss morison recalls he was having a 
difficult time raising the money for the show it took over a year 
the wait was worth it kiss me kate turned out to be 
porters biggest musical success and gave miss morison the 
opportunity to play the temperamental lili vanessi and sing such 
songs as wunderbar and so in love 
forty years later she will sing those songs again in new york at 
a cabaret for cole one of the opening attractions of the first 
new york international festival of the arts the onenight concert 
will be held sunday at town hall 
broadway has always been my first love says miss morison who 
now lives in california you never lose that once youve tasted 
it 
one of the women who turned down a role in kiss me kate will 
also be on hand for the sunday songfest mary martin will sing 
another porter song my heart belongs to daddy from leave it 
to me a number she first sang on broadway 50 years ago the show 
was miss martins broadway debut and the song a coy striptease 
number made her a star 
these two legendary women are not the only attractions at a 
cabaret for cole the other singers doing the songs of cole porter 
also have impeccable credentials they include karen akers kaye 
ballard barbara cook michael feinstein hildegarde sylvia syms 
margaret whiting and julie wilson 
the concert is a benefit for the mabel mercer foundation which 
was founded after miss mercers death in 1984 to widen the audience 
for cabaret the singer was generally considered to be the supreme 
cabaret artist known for her ability to interpret a songs 
emotional sense 
from the late 1930s until the late 1970s she sang in several new 
york nightclubs including le ruban bleu and tonys as well as at 
the st regis hotel 
porter was a great friend of miss mercer he thought her 
rendition of just one of those things was the best version ever 
done 
for miss morison the chance to appear in kiss me kate 40 
years ago was a dream come true to do it she needed to get out of 
a commitment to appear in what was a new line of work for actors in 
1947 a tv series 
i think it was called the cases of eddie drake miss 
morison says i played a lady psychiatrist to whom the detective 
came and told his stories lying on the couch 
miss morison did get to new york after the producer shot all her 
13 segments on the television show in a quick twoweek period and 
she agreed to publicize the series 
cole was a wonderful friend miss morison says he had an 
essential musicality plus there was the elegance of his lyrics 
i just saw a concert version of jubilee which is where begin 
the beguine came from that was done in 1935 even with all the 
topical and in jokes of the period about dorothy parker and elsa 
maxwell and noel coward and others the young audience watching it 
got everything cole never seems to really date

long banned from most hotels hospitals and 
commercial airliners in southeast asia the redoubtable durian is 
now barred from singapores new subway the mass rapid transport 
system 
the fabled smelly fruit is back in season and signs at each 
subway station warn no durians are allowed on the mrt 
eating and drinking on trains has been a nono since the subway 
opened in november but shoppers were allowed to carry foodstuffs 
so pungent is the durian however that extra precautions are 
deemed necessary to keep it at bay violators face the equivalent of 
a 250 fine 
we all know that durians leave a lingering odor long after they 
are taken away especially in an airconditioned place and the 
trains are airconditioned said an mrt spokesman 
the smell is even offensive to those who love the fruit they 
might like eating the fruit but i dont think they like the smell 
too much 
calling the spiky green fruit smelly does it an injustice 
it stinks 
most descriptions of the durians smell are unprintable but one 
that is printable describes the fruit this way rich brimstone 
musk whispering of depravity and monthold eggs durian is to 
fruit what limburger is to cheese and pornography is to literature 
a british governor of singapore in colonial days likened it to 
carrion in custard 
the fragrance allows no indifference you love it or you leave 
the room 
the telltale stench permeates sections of singapore malaysia 
thailand indonesia and the philippines now that the main season for 
the durian has started durians ripen twice a year in december and 
january and in june and july 
the powerful aroma is the perfume of prosperity for growers and 
others in the trade prices vary widely according to freshness 
weight shape and where they are grown a market that seems as 
delicately balanced as wall st 
three average durians sold for the equivalent of 5 as the season 
opened individual prime quality fruits fetched more than five times 
as much 
thailand is the biggest commercial grower and old asia hands 
usually rate thai durians as tops in consistency and flavor the 
most malodorous seem to be grown in the philippines 
malaysian devotees regard it as passion fruit capable of stirring 
deep emotions and there are tales of patient indonesians waiting 
days for durians to fall from trees only to have to battle sumatran 
tigers for possession of the fruit 
folklore warns that durian is heady and should not be eaten 
with alcohol those who do so are said to risk exploding 
related botanically to hibiscus hollyhock cotton and kapok the 
durian is native to malaysia and has been cultivated for centuries 
unlike the shorter thai plantation version trees in malaysia and 
elsewhere are too lofty to harvest and the fruit crashes to the 
ground when it is ripe 
fermentation that starts the moment it drops can change the 
flavor perceptibly within hours the fruit spoils within a week and 
few will eat durian more than three days after they fall 
no junk food the muchloved muchhated durian is high in 
protein carbohydrates and vitamins b and c experts say it thrives 
in soil with a high sulfur content which doubtless contributes to 
the pungent odor 
durians vary widely in size but usually are 8 inches long and 6 
inches wide and weigh about 6 pounds the outer rind bristles with 
tough thorns or duri 
they are eaten raw after careful appraisal by purists who pride 
themselves on picking out just the right one a heavy knife is used 
to split the fruit and expose the pulp which ranges in color from 
pale yellow to bright orange 
for those without ready access to durians the fruit can be 
approximated by combining these ingredients 3 bananas 2 egg yolks 
1 pinch powdered sulfur 3 tablespoons limburger cheese 1 mashed 
garlic clove onequarter pound cream cheese for body and 1 shoelace 
for texture blend ingredients into a custard mold around a horse 
chestnut and serve with apprehension

trading in tokyo today while stocks fell back modestly from their 
recordhigh close the previous day 
the dollar closed at 12577 yen down 030 yen from mondays 
finish it opened the day at 12575 yen and moved in narrow range

the market and the dollar remained stable throughout the day

the tokyo stock exchanges nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues closed at 2796732 down 2892 points or 01 percent 
on monday the stock markets key indicator rose 8976 points and

capitals including shipbuilding and steel continued to attract 
buying interest raising the trading volume said yoshio shimoyama 
of nikko securities

two small savings and loans gambled on risky 
investments in real estate and such things as windmill farms but 
collapsed from shaky lending that led to a record 135 billion 
federal payout to depositors officials say 
the federal home loan bank board on monday closed american 
diversified savings bank and north america savings and loan 
association both of costa mesa without arranging for a takeover of 
the thrifts by another institution 
these two represented abuses said bank board member lawrence 
white the whole essence of being a depository institution with 
governmentprovided insurance is that there is a strong 
obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner these two places 
did not 
both institutions have been insolvent for some time regulators 
took over management of american diversified in 1986 and of north 
america in 1987 
the bank board is paying 114 billion from the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp to american diversified depositors in the 
largest cash payout the agency has made agency chairman m danny 
wall said it is covering 209 million in deposits at north america 
wall said on nbcs today program both state and federal 
regulators are looking more closely today at troubled institutions 
than they were several years ago 
a total of about 500000 in both institutions exceeded the 
fslics 100000 liability limit those depositors will share in 
liquidation proceeds the bank board expects to recover about 400 
million from the sale of the thrifts assets 
nationally only 10 of 235 failed savings and loans since 1981 
have been resolved with a straight payout to depositors usually 
the bank board pays a bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick sampl 
because it is cheaper at the very least the board arranges to 
transfer deposits to another institution 
but the unique characteristics of the two california thrifts made 
that impractical wall said 
the thrifts had few retail deposits lacked branch offices and 
relied on highcost shortterm deposits arranged through brokers 
the brokers in turn lent out the deposits for speculative real 
estate ventures and other risky investments wall said 
closing the two thrifts will help all sampls by reducing pressure 
to pay high interest rates he said failing thrifts pay high rates 
to get the cash needed to meet expenses and some healthy thrifts 
have had to raise their rates to compete 
north america was paying 853 percent interest on deposits 145 
percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions 
american diversified was paying 864 percent 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said the two thrifts were prime examples of several score 
highflying institutions that in the early and mid1980s used 
federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky lending 
regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check it he 
said 
it was a systemic breakdown ely said what we are seeing 
are two of the more extreme examples of it but theyre not the only 
ones out there there are others 
fred wolf director of accounting and general management for the 
general accounting office said today on abctvs good morning 
america 500 savings and loan institutions are insolvent and 200 
of them are what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent 
duayne christensen an orange county dentist formed north 
america in 1983 taking advantage of the deregulated interest rates 
and liberalized lending and investment rules it solicited deposits 
at high interest rates and invested the funds primarily in highrisk 
real estate deals that later failed 
christensen was killed in an automobile accident last year the 
day before regulators seized north america in a lawsuit filed 
against his estate and a former associate the fslic accused 
christensen of fraud negligence and breach of fiduciary 
responsibility and sought at least 40 million in damages 
ranhir sahni a former airline pilot acquired american 
diversified in 1983 he also pursued an aggressive growth strategy 
increasing the thrifts asset size to almost 800 million from 11 
million in less than two years 
sahni invested in wind farms designed to produce electricity 
and in other nontraditional areas including two ethanol plants 
federal regulators have filed suit accusing sahni and other 
officers and directors of fraud and racketeering and are seeking at 
least 60 million in damages 
american diversifed and north america were two of six orange 
county savings and loans operating under the fslics management 
consignment program as of october 
since 1984 31 california thrifts have come under receivership or 
conservatorship by state or federal regulators according to the 
california department of savings and loan 
the laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble 
said state savings and loan commissioner william j crawford i 
dont know how you insure against it 
prior to american diversified the largest cash payout was 300 
million in 1984 to close the empire savings and loan of mesquite 
texas

exports of japanese cars and trucks to the united 
states fell a steep 203 percent in april the japan automotive 
manufacturers association said 
the association attributed the decline to a drop in sales of 
japanese models and an increase in us production by japanese 
automakers 
jama said japanese automakers sent 274162 cars and trucks to the 
united states in april the latest month for which statistics are 
available that was down from 344068 in the same month last year 
for the first four months of 1988 combined car and truck exports 
are down 145 percent from the comparable period in 1987 
while japanese exports have fallen the big three domestic 
automakers increased their market share general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp have picked up a combined 32 points of 
market share in the car and truck market so far this year 
the decline in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese 
yen has forced japanese automakers to raise prices to the point

the government will continue to stand behind 
the nations troubled savings and loan institutions but that could 
mean eventually having to turn to the taxpayers for more money a 
general accounting office official said today 
i dont know of any other source you could tap fred wolf 
director of accounting and general management for the gao the 
investigating arm of congress said on abcs good morning 
america 
the federal government has clearly said that regardless of the 
problems we stand behind the insurance wolf said 
but considering the state of the industry if savings 
institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the 
insurance fund theres only one other source and thats 
ultimately the taxpayer he said 
wolf said some 500 savings and loans across the country are 
insolvent and 20 of them are what we would classify as hopelessly 
insolvent 
two institutions closed monday are neither the best nor the worst 
in the country and there are a number of other large ones that will 
wind up costing about the same when they fail he said 
the record 135 billion payment to depositors in two failed 
california savings institutions is likely to renew debate over how 
long the fund that insures thrifts can last without congressional 
action 
so far the federal savings and loan insurance corp has gotten 
by without taxpayer money congress last august provided for an 
infusion of 108 billion over three years to be raised by sale of 
bonds paid off by the industry the federal home loan bank board 
the agency in charge of thrift institutions has used 29 billion 
of that borrowing authority 
the fslic which guarantees deposits up to 100000 is paying 
114 billion to american diversified savings bank and 209 million 
to north america savings and loan association both are located in 
costa mesa calif 
the american diversified transaction is fslics largest cash 
payout in the agencys 54year history according to the top federal 
sampl regulator m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board 
the agency has spent more on assistance transactions including 
2 billion a month ago to help southwest savings association in 
dallas acquire four insolvent sampls and 13 billion in november to 
bail out vernon savings and loan association also of dallas 
but in those cases most of the help came in the form of notes 
promising payment if needed and guarantees against certain future 
losses 
the two california transactions drop the insurance fund cash 
balance from 32 billion to 19 billion however another 465 
million in revenue is due this month from insurance premiums paid by 
healthy sampls 
all told including insurance premium payments by sampls the fund 
should have about 20 billion to work with over three years and 
about 30 billion over 10 years 
however the gao says that may not be enough about 500 of the 
nations 3120 federally insured sampls are considered insolvent and 
the gao says it will cost 26 billion to 36 billion to clean up the 
mess 
private analysts put the price tag even higher at about 50 
billion 
problems ahead for the thrift industry include texas where 143 
of 281 thrifts are ailing sunbelt savings association in dallas 
alone recorded a 12 billion loss in the first quarter of this year 
in california the rescue of the second largest sampl holding 
company in the nation financial corp of america in irvine is 
still pending the robert m bass group of fort worth texas is 
negotiating with the bank board over a takeover estimates of the 
cost of that bail out run into the billions 
wall says the bank board has all it can responsibly spend through 
1990 but should more money be required there are basically three 
sources where congress will look 
the first is the industry george gould undersecretary of the 
treasury estimates the industry could finance something less than 
15 billion thats vigorously opposed by sampl lobby groups 
the second is the federal deposit insurance corp which has 18 
billion to insure deposits in 13650 commercial banks commercial 
banks and their regulators are already moving to try to head that 
off 
the third source would be tax funds not an easy proposition to 
get by congress in an age of budget limits

attorneys for the former president of beechnut 
nutrition corp who was convicted of distributing phony apple 
juice have asked that their client be ordered to speak to business 
students about his mistakes as an alternative to a prison term 
niels hoyvald was found guilty feb 17 of 351 counts of violating 
the federal food drug and cosmetic act each count carries a 
possible threeyear prison term and a 10000 fine

lavery are scheduled to be sentenced friday in us district court 
in brooklyn lavery was found guilty of 429 counts of violating the 
same act along with 18 counts of mail fraud and one count of 
conspiracy 
hoyvalds attorneys said in a presentencing memorandum 
business students undoubtedly hear this principle regularly in 
their ethics classes but the impact of the message would be far 
clearer coming from niels hoyvald whose career has been shattered 
because he did not heed it than it could ever be coming from a 
textbook or a professor 
thomas roche the lead prosecutor in the case said the 
governments sentencing recommendations would be made public at the 
sentencing hearing he declined comment on the memorandum 
hoyvald president and chief executive officer of beechnut from 
april 1981 until shortly before his indictment in november 1986 
said in his defense during the trial he did not know about the 
distribution of flavored sugar water as juice until june 25 1982 
after that date hoyvald said he relied on the advice of four 
attorneys in allowing continued distribution of the phony juice 
according to the government the product contained little or no 
apple juice 
beechnut based in fort washington pa is a subsidiary of

grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply 
higher again this morning on the chicago board of trade but many 
contracts quickly began to fade in early dealings 
wheat fell into the minus column shortly after the opening 
all the major agricultural futures advanced the permissible 
limits monday and the exchange expanded both the trading limits and 
margin requirements for today 
the exchanges action puts traders in greater jeopardy and 
dampens the upward price movement said jerry gidel an analyst with 
gh miller amp co 
in addition weekly crop reports released after the close of 
trading monday showed some deterioration of the wheat crop but it 
less than had been expected said gidel 
weather conditions remain severely dry and warm in the midwest 
although there was some promise of showers in parts of indiana and 
ohio 
in early trading wheat was 6 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 376 a bushel corn was 5 
cents to 10 cents higher with july at 252 a bushel oats were 10 
cents to 12 cents higher with july at 219 a bushel and soybeans 
were 14 cents to 25 cents higher with july at 904 a bushel

the food and drug administration is planning to 
ban four color additives used in cosmetics and drugs because they 
may cause cancer 
officials announced monday that the additives red dyes nos 8 
9 and 19 and orange dye no 17 will be banned beginning july 15 
the announcement followed an april 18 supreme court decision in 
which the high court refused to let the government approve the use 
of color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer 
the court rejected arguments by the cosmetics industry that safe 
substances are being forced off the market 
the supreme court let stand a ruling last october by the us 
circuit court of appeals here that federal law prohibits the fda 
from approving use of red dye no 19 and orange dye no 17 even 
though the cancer risks are trivial 
government researchers citing tests with laboratory animals 
said the lifetime use of a product with orange dye no 17 poses a 
cancer risk of one in 19 billion and for red dye no 19 one in nine 
million 
the fda said the threat from each use was so trivial as to be 
effectively no risk 
the appeals court gave a strict interpretation to a 1960 federal 
law that prohibits fda approval for any color additive found 
to induce cancer in man or animal 
william b schultz a lawyer for the activist consumer group 
public citizen said the decision was important because the dyes 
offer no health benefit and some cancers will be prevented 
for cosmetics it may mean there a few shades of lipstick that 
will be lost i think that will make no difference to people he 
said 
peter barton hutt a lawyer representing the cosmetics 
toiletries and fragrances association said the decision was a 
disappointment but that it was more important as a symbol than in 
terms of its specific impact

a rural north dakota factory is making it 
easier to locate baggage at busy airports place bets at las vegas 
casinos and even find love in a bustling east coast singles bar 
northstar enterprises inc makes computerized indoor message 
boards and signs and is winning acceptance as one of the leaders in 
the industry 
we really feel were the cadillac of the business said 
northstar president allan larson thats what were shooting for 
larson declines to disclose the 9yearold companys sales 
figures but said they have grown by 20 percent to 30 percent a year 
since it was founded 
he predicts that the lightemitting diode industry in five years 
should reach 200 million in sales and he believes northstar will 
capture up to 20 percent of the market 
the opportunities are just unlimited said larson 
the industry is relatively new about six us companies are 
manufacturing electronic message systems and most are less than a 
decade old 
northstar started in 1979 with five products it now offers more 
than 30 and is doing more custom design work said larson who 
joined the company in 1980 and became president in 1982 
northstars message boards can be programmed for hundreds of 
different messages from a computer keyboard the messages can be 
programmed to run laterally or up and down and can be accompanied by 
graphics or animation 
the message boards can be custombuilt to any specifications but 
many of the signs come with letters about 7 inches to 8 inches high 
larson said the boards are generally long but only about as deep as 
the letters 
the signs are made up of hundreds of bulbs most come with red 
bulbs which light up according to a computer command to form 
messages 
specialized software is where the future lies said dewey 
olson vice president and national sales manager and the last of 
northstars three founders still with the company 
northstar was founded by two mayville men olson and dale beck 
and a chicagobased computer consultant steve hogan who saw an 
untapped market for electronic message systems 
the company operates out of a 5000squarefoot plant located 
between mayville population 2255 and portland population 627 
about 55 miles north of fargo nd the plant employs 22 people 
fulltime and another dozen parttimers are on the payroll 
in 1986 northstar merged with lexicon inc a salt lake 
citybased company that made computer software 
the company has placed boards in airports casinos hospitals 
restaurants bars bowling alleys financial institutions and 
schools nationwide 
northstar boards flash instant odds on sporting events at 
caesars palace in las vegas and harrahs in atlantic city nj 
several midsize airports use the boards to help travelers locate 
baggage and boarding areas the company also has completed a deal 
with the baltimore mass transit system olson said 
in addition northstar has developed what it believes to be the 
first electronic display cardiac alert system in the nation larson 
said the system which has been in use at the bethesda naval 
hospital for four years allows medical personnel to alert 27 
critical areas of the hospital simultaneously during an emergency 
involving a heart patient he says 
looking to the future company officials see its message boards 
used as promotional devices on city buses subway cars and 
paytelephones company officials believe the airport industry 
provides the greatest potential and olson said he is already 
working on more projects with major airports around the country 
one of the most unusual uses of the companys message boards has 
been in a game called selectrocution played in east coast singles 
bars in the game bar patrons use a message board to make 
acquaintances the game ends with the patrons being ranked for 
desirability by others in the bar and matched by computer at 
evenings end with anyone expressing mutual interest 
with bids out on more than 16 million worth of projects and 
several others already in the works larson feels the future holds 
promise for his company 
our products are applicable in so many areas its hard to 
narrow the scope to areas that will have the greatest impact 
larson said were trying to look at key markets where we can 
concentrate and do a good job

cooler makers are putting on a new face this 
summer as they try to inspire fresh interest in a beverage category 
whose torrid growth pace slowed markedly last year 
the california cooler beach party is history so is the sun 
country cooler spokesbear and actor bruce willis is missing from 
the action in new ads for seagrams wine coolers 
frank and ed are still pitching bartles amp jaymes coolers but it 
is uncertain who is going to be dreaming up new commercials for the 
folksy pair since the ad agency that created the brands fictional 
founding fathers quit 
something else is missing the fruit pulp that category pioneer 
california cooler had once brandished as evidence that it was the 
real stuff 
but the cooler makers are trying to liven things up with new 
flavors that they hope will get people to try their first cooler or 
give them another try 
seagrams the category leader plans eight flavors this year up 
from six last year bartles amp jaymes has doubled its list to four 
california cooler has five flavors up from four a year ago 
the big question facing the industry is whether coolers are a 
sustainable segment of the alcoholic beverage market or just a fad 
cooler sales tailed off in the second half of last summer prompting 
some analysts to speculate that consumers had tired of the 
sweettasting concoctions of fruit juice alcohol and water and were 
moving on to other drinks 
according to impact a publication of m shanken communications 
inc that tracks the wine business cooler shipments grew only 6 
percent to an estimated 726 million cases in 1987 industry 
executives said at an average price of about 350 for a fourpack 
that put the retail value of the category at about 15 billion 
but the 1987 growth rate was well below that in each of the 
previous three years in which the category rocketed from a few 
million cases in 1983 impact said the category grew 65 percent in 
1986 after tripling the previous year and soaring more than fivefold 
in 1984 when california cooler first encountered serious competition 
analysts said a slowdown in such growth was inevitable 
maybe for some people it was a fad said jon fredrikson 
president of gomberg fredrikson and associates wine industry 
consultants in san francisco but we believe there are hardcore 
winecooler drinkers out there who will continue to drink these 
products 
marvin shanken editor and publisher of impact said he also 
thought the category would survive and recently predicted it would 
amount to 133 million cases annually by the year 2000 
they each cited the categorys appeal to women drinkers and 
others who prefer an lightalcohol alternative to beer 
the shortterm outlook is unclear however shanken refused to 
estimate growth prospects for 1988 and fredrikson said the market 
may be flat 
william slone president of beverage media ltd a trade 
publisher said a lot of people have their fingers crossed but 
we havent seen any upturn in that market yet among retailers 
there is no expectation of any meaningful growth this year 
seagrams wine coolers from seagram beverage co of new york 
nosed ahead of bartles amp jaymes from eampj gallo winery of modesto 
calif last year according to impact california cooler from 
brownforman beverage co in louisville was third followed by sun 
country made by canandaigua wine co of a town by that name in new 
york 
seagram ended its twoyear association with willis the star of 
the television series moonlighting by mutual agreement this 
year said mark taxel a seagram executive he said willis helped 
seagram get to where we are in the market but our needs now are 
more complex 
he said seagram will use a series of celebrities for different 
flavors of its coolers including its new lime mist and seagrams 
extra new ads aired so far have featured actors steve guttenberg 
woody harrelson and anne archer 
bartles amp jaymes introduced a berry flavor in january and a new 
peach cooler in april which for the first time was heralded in an 
ad featuring frank and ed that was not created by gallos longtime 
agency hal riney amp partners of san francisco riney resigned last 
december and gallo spokesman dan solomon declined to discuss when a 
new fulltime agency may be retained 
california cooler had put the pulp in its citrus and orange 
coolers from the start in the early 1980s to make them look like the 
drinks that the todays coolers descended from mixtures of fruit 
juice and wine poured over huge blocks of ice in tubs on 
californias beaches in the 1960s its ads once featured songs from 
the era like louie louie and the bird is the word 
but both the beach party scenes and the 60s classics are gone 
from the new ads that use special effects to do things like 
transform a cherry into a bottle of its new wild cherry splash 
flavor 
john shastid an executive at brownforman said that while pulp 
had been an effective early addition to the drinks consumers now 
realize coolers contain real fruit juice and prefer coolers without 
pulp 
sun country dumped the pulp from its flavors too saying 
consumers were turned off by sediment at the bottom of the bottle 
it has also retired the ad approach that used celebrities in polar 
bear costumes to pitch its drink which now comes in eight flavors 
up from six 
the steamy ads for its new strawberry blush and wild jamaican 
rumflavored wine coolers made the abc and cbs networks blush 
executives demanded revisions in the ads that show scantilydressed 
men and women looking for relief from the heat and sun country 
complied 
miller brewing co which entered the cooler market with matilda 
bay last fall recently introduced its second flavor its ads pitch 
the only noncarbonated cooler among the majors as a drink from 
australia 
it is undaunted that another brewer anheuserbusch inc 
abandoned the cooler market by discontinuing its dewey stevens brand 
last year 
michael boykin brand manager for matilda bay in milwaukee said 
miller is convinced of the longterm potential of the market 
we think we can be one of the key players in the category he 
said

in luxembourg cars carry the first 
european license plates featuring a replica of a 
blueandyellow european flag 
at a rural train stop in northern france a new welcoming sign not 
only says the town is french but that france is a member of the 
european economic community or common market 
in the dutch town of sintoedenrode a furnituremanufacturing 
plant flies the same flag that is on the luxembourgs license 
plates and a sticker on a restaurant window in brussels site of 
eec headquarters says my country europe 
across much of western europe outward signs are multiplying that 
the eec is drawing wider public interest in its quest to create a 
true community of nations and in the view of proponents gain 
greater influence on international economic and political matters 
already the eec is in conflict with the united states and japan 
on some economic issues and business competition with these two 
economic powerhouses and other western allies is growing in many 
areas the most recent dispute with washington is over eec farm 
subsidies and their effects on american farmers 
at the same time the 12nation community has been improving 
trade ties with the soviet union and the communist east bloc even 
more so than with its western allies 
while the 31yearold organization still is far from its goal of 
fully weaving together the economic social and political fabric of 
western europe the integration process in recent years has reached 
a new plateau one from which ordinary citizens can feel involved 
the community has created its own currency the european currency 
unit ecu for bookkeeping purposes but eventually hopes to 
circulate the currency for common use among its people to promote 
that idea the winner of an annual eecsponsored tennis tournament 
is paid in an ecu check which can be cashed for another eec national 
currency 
its still not clear how far the eec can go with its drive for 
greater european unity 
some of its members including britain and denmark show little 
desire to go beyond the creation of a simple common market in which 
goods and people can move freely across national frontiers others 
are dedicated to a grander goal a europe with a single political 
identity or as its founders liked to put it a united states of 
europe 
whatever the approach the pool of money available for joint 
spending is limited the members devote less than 2 percent of their 
national incomes to the eec budget which this year totals 55 
billion 
even the more modest goal of ending national barriers to trade 
has been beyond the eecs reach some european leaders say this is 
the organizations most damning failure although most believe the 
bloc will meet its latest selfimposed deadline of 1992 for removing 
these barriers 
an eec study published in may said creation of a genuine common 
market by 1992 would mean a 45 percent boost in economic growth for 
the region a 6 percent drop in consumer prices and 18 million new 
jobs 
the study said the european economy could save as much as 320 
billion over an unspecified medium term by achieving an 
integrated market 
despite its slightly blurred vision of the future the eec 
appears to have found new success in persuading people that the 
slow tedious process of european integration is more than a 
bureaucratic exercise 
opinion polls show a slight increase in recent years in public 
support for the idea of european unification although most people 
still have only a vague notion of what the eec is and how it 
operates 
a poll of people in all member nations late last year indicated 
that 85 percent thought their countrys membership in the group was 
a good thing a 1983 poll put the figure at 79 percent and in 1980 
it was 76 percent 
in some ways the effort to make people feel attached to the aims 
and affairs of the eec is seen by its leaders as their most 
important task 
in the early years of this decade the common market was mired in 
a seemingly endless dispute over internal finances decisions on 
other matters fell far behind schedule nothing seemed to be getting 
done and all the while people saw high inflation and growing 
unemployment 
this was more than just another weak moment for an organization 
that had survived many while remaining largely on track 
a turnaround began in june 1984 at a meeting in the 16th century 
fontainebleau chateau outside paris the eec government leaders 
resolved their budget wrangle although other money problems cropped 
up later 
of possibly more lasting significance was a decision at that 
summit meeting to launch what was called a peoples europe 
campaign 
the leaders at fontainebleau recognized that the eecs problems 
went deeper than the money debate they saw a need to make the whole 
integration process appear relevant to individual citizens to make 
people believe that the eecs aspirations were bound up with their 
own 
were putting europe back in gear gaston thorn then the 
eecs chief executive said when the fontainebleau accords were 
announced

among the programs created under the peoples europe 
initiative are a system of grants to university students wishing to 
study in an eec country other than their own and the introduction 
of new european symbols such as the flag and an anthem beethovens 
ode to joy 
the grants programs was given the name erasmus european action 
scheme for the mobility of university students to recall the 16th 
century dutch humanist who was one of the great figures of the 
renaissance 
since fontainebleau the common market has suffered many 
setbacks including debilitating battles over its budget and failure 
to find a way of reducing the regions high jobless rate of 104 
percent which is nearly double the us rate of 54 percent 
its ambitious and costly plans for boosting the economic 
competitiveness of backward regions in europe also have been largely 
disappointing about onesixth of the total eec budget is devoted to 
these efforts 
yet the eec has scored many successes 
some of the significant ones 
bringing spain and portugal into the organization jan 1 1986 
in political terms this was aimed at strengthening democracy in two 
nations that only a decade or so earlier had shed dictatorships it 
also gave the eec a combined population of 320 million boosted itsride 
calling 
his historic candidacy a catalyst for growth 
republican george bush who has the gop nomination in the bag 
expressed eagerness to face dukakis in the fall he said the two 
have many differences and i am on the right side 
dukakis said today there may well be a floor fight or two 
with jackson and his supporters at the democratic national 
convention next month but he added i dont see any great 
divisions within our party 
he said the united states must go far beyond our current 
sanctions against south africa but he stopped short of calling 
south africa a terrorist nation a label demanded of dukakis and the 
party by jackson 
dukakis said he and jackson talked in general terms of jacksons 
postprimary role in the party during a meeting last night but he 
would not give details he said the vice presidency was not 
discussed 
the fourmonth presidential primary season closed today with 
races in california new jersey new mexico and montana all three 
presidential contenders were in california today and all were 
staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the days 
contests 
early turnout was reported light in new jersey and moderate in 
new mexico 
the biggest prize is california and an abc news tracking poll 
indicated dukakis led jackson in the state by a 21 margin 61 
percent to 30 percent the survey based on 415 interviews saturday 
and sunday had a margin of error of 6 percentage points the 
network reported monday night 
california officials were predicting a low turnout however 
secretary of state march fong eu said she expected a turnout of 48 
percent which would be the lowest in more than 40 years 
before todays voting began dukakis had nearly 1900 delegates 
leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2081 needed to nominate on 
monday alone more than 70 delegates flocked to the dukakis camp 
jackson trails with less than 1000 delegates 
there were 466 delegates at stake in todays primaries 
in addition dukakis former rivals for the nomination were 
lining up behind him campaign sources said dukakis would travel to 
missouri on wednesday the day after the last primaries to pick up 
rep richard gephardts endorsement the same day the sources said 
sen paul simon of illinois was to endorse the massachusetts 
governor in washington 
dukakis wife kitty was following it all from her hospital bed 
in boston where she was recovering from spinal surgery i think 
michael will do well and im hoping by the eighth of june that he 
will have sewn up the convention she said 
dukakis not noted for his effusiveness nonetheless sounded like 
a happy man as he headed into the final contests 
im really overwhelmed by the good feeling the spirit the 
confidence a sense of victory is in the air he said as he 
campaigned monday in los angeles 
jackson however suffered a primaryeve embarrassment when he 
missed the first 16 minutes of a live halfhour statewide broadcast 
that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform 
for a dramatic final appeal 
the shows host radio disc jockey casey kasem was left to 
conduct an awkward interview with jacksons state campaign chairman 
and show repetitive video montages of the campaign when jackson 
finally arrived he appeared calm but was perspiring profusely as he 
outlined his positions 
although kasem had repeatedly referred to jacksons lateness 
during the first half of the broadcast the candidate later 
contended we really came in on time because kasem filled the air 
time jackson said he thought the broadcast went well 
dukakis went to jacksons los angeles hotel room for a latenight 
meeting monday night neither man would comment to reporters after 
the hourandahalf meeting and dukakis walked tightlipped through 
a crush of reporters in the lobby 
jackson told the new york times in an interview published today 
that he had earned the option to be offered the vice 
presidential spot he had said previously he deserved consideration 
for the post 
in recent weeks jackson has been looking ahead to the convention 
and pressing his platform demands but he has also been looking back 
at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black 
candidate jackson said his candidacy has helped build racial 
tolerance 
its clear america has become more and more accustomed to jesse 
jackson as a possible next president he said monday its a 
matter of growth im the stimulus im the catalyst for that 
growth 
bush meanwhile got a primaryeve boost of sorts from the reagan 
administration interior secretary donald hodel announced monday 
night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oildrilling 
project off the california coast 
earlier this week in what was then a step away from the 
administration the vice president called for a delay in the 
project the two democrats oppose it outright and dukakis had 
faulted bush for failing to do likewise 
bush speaking to a republican audience on monday said he 
cant wait for this primary season to end so he can go 
headtohead with dukakis 
for bush the primary season has been over for some time he 
clinched the 1139 delegates he needed for the gop nomination back 
in april but the republican competition effectively ended three 
months ago when the vice president racked up landslide wins across 
the south

experts from eastern and western europe 
met in this port city tuesday in an attempt to sort out the 
pollution problems that are plaguing the baltic and the north seas 
a carpet of algae spread in recent weeks along the norwegian and 
swedish coasts killing farm trout and salmon worth millions of 
dollars and causing unknown damage to wild fish an epidemic of a 
herpes virus has killed hundreds of seals in danish and german 
waters this spring 
pollution from farms sewers and industry was suspected in both 
cases 
about 175 delegates from sweden the soviet union finland 
poland west germany east germany denmark norway the netherlands 
and britain were attending the threeday meeting said spokesman 
torsten wikstrom 
the timing of the conference coinciding with the algae plague 
was not meant that way said wikstrom but he said the algae was 
a main topic on the first day of talks 
farmers from all countries represented have been blamed for heavy 
use of fertilizers which eventually find their way to the seas and 
some municipal governments will face costly outlays for better 
sewage treatment if the seas are to be cleaned up 
harald velner executive secretary of the helsinki commission 
singled out the soviet union and poland as major polluters but 
wikstrom said the meeting has mostly been free of recriminations 
the delegates included local regional and national politicians 
as well as marine experts

bond prices slipped in early trading today as 
investors apparently refocused their attention on negative economic 
signals 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond was down 1532 point or 
nearly 470 per 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price rose to 91 percent from 905 percent late 
monday 
analysts said there was no news to send the market downward but 
they suggested investors who ignored economic signs during a 
fourday rally last week might again be concerned about inflation 
and other factors 
its behaving more in lines with the economic fundamentals 
today said maury harris an economist at painewebber inc 
the market has been rallying here for a couple of weeks without 
any particular reason said robert brusca an economist at nikko 
securities co international 
i would have to chalk it up to normal unexplainable bond 
market dynamics he said of todays performance 
some analysts attributed the recent runup to technical factors 
during the rally bond traders ignored soaring commodity prices a 
harbinger of higher inflation that usually leads to credit market 
declines 
bond traders fear inflation because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities and can lead to higher interest rates 
some commodities prices were sharply higher in early trading 
today 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds today prices of 
shortterm government issues were unchanged to 132 point lower 
intermediate maturities fell between point and 516 point and 
longterm issues were down point according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 024 to 10941 the shearson lehman daily

a federal appeals court today set aside a 
contempt of court order against eastern airlines and an injunction 
barring the company from selling its northeast shuttle to another 
subsidiary of its parent texas air corp 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled that us district 
judge john h pratt failed to make proper factual findings when he 
held eastern in contempt for taking steps to sell the profitable 
eastern air shuttle to a newly created subsidiary of texas air 
the deal was challenged by the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers aflcio which contended the sale 
would violate the terms of a july 1987 injunction that pratt had 
issued in another labor dispute involving eastern 
the iam which represents 13000 eastern employees contends that 
texas air is trying to break up the airlines various components to 
weaken the power of the unions at the financially troubled carrier 
which texas air purchased in 1986 
a unanimous threejudge panel dissolved the injunction issued by 
pratt that bars eastern from proceeding with plans to sell the 
bostontonew yorktowashington shuttle to another subsidiary of 
texas air for 225 million 
it also set aside the modified injunction pratt issued barring 
the sale but gave the union 10 days to seek a temporary restraining 
order to stop the deal the court directed pratt to hold a factual 
hearing to determine if an injunction is warranted 
the court in an opinion by judge harry t edwards held that the 
july 1987 injunction pratt issued barring eastern from transferring 
6000 groundcrew workers into a subsidiary called airport ground 
services did not prohibit the shuttle deal 
thus eastern could not be held in contempt of the 1987 order for 
taking steps to transfer ownership of the shuttle 
in issuing the march order the district court did not weigh 
the tradiitonal equitable criteria nor did it make factual 
findings necessary to support the issuance of a new or modified 
injunction edwards wrote in an opinion joined by judges stephen 
williams and louis oberdorfer 
we appreciate the district courts concern that easterns 
announcement of the shuttle deal may have suggested a disregard for 
the spirit of the july injunction edwards wrote nonetheless 
this is an insufficient basis upon which to rest a finding of 
contempt where the district court has issued a new or modified 
injunction 
iam spokesman jim conley said the union had no immediate comment 
because its lawyers had not yet studied the decision 
eastern spokesman robin matell said we are pleased with the 
decision and are studying its implications

in the soviet union some bureaucrats in effect 
are saying the public be damned said soviet economist stanislav 
menshikov the bureaucracy is sabotaging reform 
sitting nearby american economist john kenneth galbraith was 
reminded of how rigid bureacuracry can be in america too not just 
in government but in the private sector as well 
it reminds me of galbraiths first law of executive 
management said the harvard professor he paused then stated the 
law businessmen inevitably become like their products consider 
the folks who ran the us steel industry he suggested 
like a vaudeville team working the boards this unlikely duo 
produce a lively dialogue in support of their new book 
capitalism communism and coexistence comparing and 
contrasting capitalism and communism forecasting and analyzing and 
feeding cues to each other 
they have had a lot of training both are accomplished 
economists wise and witty serious but colorful of sufficient 
stature to state their positions with verve and confidence and they 
have since last summer 
discussing economics for 10 days at galbraiths vermont home 
they literally talked into existence their joint volume which has 
been published simultaneously in the united states by houghton 
mifflin and in the soviet union 
it defies the notion that serious economics needs to be dull 
each afternoon we met to consider our topic for the next 
morning each morning we took up one of the subjects that gives 
title to one or more of the chapters in this book galbraith says 
in the introduction 
the deeper purpose he continues was to show that an american 
and a russian of different views could engage in civil and we 
hoped informative discussions of our different and common 
problems 
the discussions were informed of course but more notably they 
were amazingly frank americans familiar with galbraith expect that 
from him but most americans are unaccustomed to hearing a soviet of 
the same sort 
menshikov a former united nations official member of the staff 
of the communist central committee and author of books such as 
millionaires and managers is now on the staff of world marxist 
review published in prague czechoslovakia 
we dont represent an official view menshikov said of 
himself and his partner i wrote this as an independent person 
its my view 
in his view and galbraiths also the economies of the two 
nations are in a period of critical change with both facing huge 
problems of production trade budgeting and bureaucracy to name a 
few commonly shared issues 
there is a reassessment for both systems said menshikov as 
he and galbraith relaxed after promoting their book on an morning 
television show 
socialism is in a period of crisis or precrisis menshikov 
continued its not a crisis in the sense that somebody is going to 
die but the old ways of operating the system is no longer 
valid he said 
once they might have been valid he continued it was 
probably right for building up heavy industry he said but he 
seemed to suggest that todays more open lifestyle and economy might 
benefit from consumer items too 
changes must be made menshikov said seeming to feed a cue to 
galbraith who responded in both systems theres a tendency to 
say were comfortable were on the right track 
bureacracy was common ground for the authors 
galbraith saw grave weakenesses in the american industrial 
structure he expressed concern about the response to foreign 
competition he commented on the bureaucratic neglect that allowed 
trade and budget deficits to develop 
ours is more dangerous said menshikov about the soviet 
bureaucracy it acts in the name of the state it is more 
dangerous than corporate bureacracy because in a corporation you 
have some competition 
but you must beware of either kind menshikov said bureaucracy 
leads to ossification and stagnation weve had a stagnant economy 
for some time 
we have 17 million bureacrats he continued what can you 
do with them if you threaten to fire them they would merely fire 
others first we must eliminate their power to give orders to 
plant managers we must stop the meddling 
perhaps menshikov suggested we should pay them but not listen 
to them

has yet to adequately address its own foreign trade imbalance the 
ministry of international trade and industry said tuesday 
in a report on japans foreign trade in 1987 miti said 
structural changes in the countrys economy combined with the yens 
appreciation against the us dollar have led to increased imports 
and a slowing of growth in exports 
japans industrial structure is becoming geared to domestic 
demand said atsushi oi director of the ministrys international 
trade research office manufactured imports are increasing rapidly 
and the distribution system is undergoing a change 
imports of manufactured goods rose to 739 billion in fiscal 
1987 from 552 billion in fiscal 1986 fueled primarily by the 
rapid appreciation of the japanese yen according to government 
statistics 
but the report warned that the budget and trade deficits of the 
united states as well as other international imbalances are 
having a dampening influence on trade and investment by causing 
exchange rate fluctuations and destabilizing market prices 
some economists say the period of sharp reductions in japans 
trade surplus is at an end while the surplus has been declining 
compared with last years levels the seasonally adjusted trade 
surplus has lately been increasing from month to month 
oi said the united states could reduce its trade deficit by 
slashing runaway consumer demand expanding production facilities 
and revamping its export policy 
the ministry report urged major industrial countries to 
coordinate their economic policies more closely in light of todays 
rising economic interdependence 
international policy coordination is essential to the effective 
resolution of imbalances said oi whose office compiled the 
report which has been issued annually since 1949 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa said tuesday that japans 
exports to the united states will fall from the present 40 percent 
of japans total exports to 25 to 30 percent of total exports he 
did not predict how long it would take for that to happen 
spurred by the rapid rise in the value of the yen imports of 
consumer goods from the european economic community rose by 263 
percent in 1987 over the previous year the trade ministry said 
those from the newly industrialized countries of south korea 
taiwan hong kong and singapore soared by 503 percent in the same 
period according to the trade report 
by comparison imports of us consumer goods rose only 84 
percent 
since early 1985 the yen has risen by more than 100 percent 
against the us dollar making japanese exports more expensive 
overseas but boosting japans import buying power 
oi said japan is prepared to import more manufactured goods from 
asian nations and step up direct investment in the region 
he said asias newly industrialized countries have depended on 
the us market for their development but it will be difficult to 
continue to depend on exports to the united states 
to offset the burden on us markets japan was prepared to help 
by absorbing more asian products and offering technological and 
economic assistance as well as stepping up direct investment he 
said

japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
and european economic community officials agreed tuesday to step up 
trade contacts 
takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by eec commission 
president jacques delors to create a panel of experts to discuss 
technical aspects of the eecs rocky trade relations with japan 
officials said 
takeshita also stressed the need for japan and the 12nation eec 
to widen their relations beyond trade to cultural and scientific 
sectors 
the relationship between europe and japan is not very strong or 
as well developed as that between the united states with europe 
and japan an aide to takeshita told reporters 
senior eec and japanese officials meet annually an eec official 
said delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in 
defusing trade tensions 
the eec is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of 
dumping by japanese exporters 
the eec official who asked not to be named said eec foreign 
trade commissioner willy de clercq noted a remarkable improvement 
in trade relations between the 12nation trade bloc and japan 
even though the eec continues to register a large trade deficit with 
japan 
the gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987 but was still 25 billion 
for his part takeshita said the eecs plans to turn the 12 eec 
states into a single borderless market by the end of 1992 was good 
for japan 
but his aide quoted him as saying the single market after 
1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world and that 
the eec should remove restrictions on japanese exports 
but he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade an issue the 
eec has given high priority in order to gain greater access for 
european goods to the japanese market 
we fully understand what the eec commission people are saying 
on reciprocity but japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral 
basis takeshita was quoted as saying 
among specific trade issues discussed were japans high taxes on 
imported liquor and cars the difficulties of foreign companies 
bidding on japanese public works projects and better access for eec 
exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors 
the eec side also urged japan to liberalize its banking sector 
officials said delors stressed european banks must be able to 
establish themselves in japan to make it easier to finance european 
exports and investments 
de clercq also called on japan to quickly comply with a general 
agreement on tariffs and trade ruling to amend an accord with the 
united states on trade in semiconductors the world trade body has 
ruled the deal discriminates against the eec 
takeshita also asked delors advice as to the best way to 
distribute 500 million japan has earmarked as special economic 
assistance to africa 
we are aware that european countries have a long relationship 
with african countries the aide quoted takeshita as saying

illegal exploitation of child workers is widespread 
in much of the third world and most national trade unions do little 
to combat it according to a report released tuesday by the 
international labor organization 
the report by the genevabased group said some governments fail 
to enforce bans against child labor and even facilitate exploitation 
because industries that employ children can be important earners of 
foreign exchange 
some experts cited in the report estimate that at least 100 
million boys and girls are employed worldwide many of them younger 
than 10 years old and many unpaid 
those who are paid for their work rarely receive an income even 
approaching the minimum wage the survey said they receive no 
fringe benefits insurance or social security payments child 
workers are the lowest paid but work the longest hours 
the 226page report noted that such conditions give employers a 
competitive advantage abroad regional studies included in the 
report said some exporters in india and egypt would rather cease 
trading than replace children with adult labor because of the cost 
of the switch 
the report deplored the almost total absence of initiatives by 
national workers organizations in the campaign against child 
labor 
because the exploitation of child workers can be a threat to 
their economic interest and because it constitutes a violation of 
the rights and dignity for which labor has campaigned all along 
workers organizations have a particular obligation to promote and 
assist in the campaign against child labor the report said 
recent efforts by the international confederation of free trade 
unions and by britains trade union congress are the almost sole 
exceptions the report said 
case studies in the report acknowledged efforts made in india 
brazil colombia and the philippines and said child labor was 
virtually eliminated in hong kong following improvements in social 
security benefits and education policy 
but the report said that in much of the third world child labor 
continues to be widely prevalent in agriculture industry and 
services despite national legislation prohibiting it 
payment in many industries is made upon completion of a specified 
task or period it said 
in peruvian gold mines and in deep sea fishing operations off the 
philippines medicines supplementary food and working days lost 
because of illness are deducted from the pay according to the 
report children more likely to suffer occupational injuries may 
be indebted to the employer at the end of the contract 
fifteen years ago the confederation set a mimimum age of 12 or 
13 for light work but a study on child labor in the quarries 
and brickyards of peru found the majority of the children working 
there started even before they were eight years old the report 
said 
the report said that in kenya family labor involved around 90 
percent of all children between six and 15 years of age and was 
common in both rural and urban areas in a large variety of tasks 
from washing clothes to the sale of crops on local markets

a major international law firm said tuesday it 
will pay the salaries of 125 young lawyers each year who are are 
willing to work for the poor for two years after law school 
for five years beginning next june skadden arps will funnel 10 
million to qualified public service organizations to pay the 
salaries of skadden fellows 
the lawyers would provide legal services in civil law for poor 
people deprived of civil or human rights and who unlike persons 
accused of crime are not guaranteed counsel by the constitution 
the program also will instill in the lawyers a taste for pro bono 
public benefit work said peter p mullen executive partner of 
skadden arps slate meagher amp flom the firm 
the program will take the form of fellowships that pay about 
32500 a year plus fringe benefits comparable to secondyear 
salaries of federal judicial clerks said the announcement from 
skadden arps 
twentyfive skadden fellows will be named each year for the next 
five years and each will serve about two years 
there are many lawyers interested in and capable of dealing 
with the legal problems the disadvantaged encounter and there are 
many organizations that provide needy persons with legal services 
said mullen the problem has been that the organizations lack the 
funds to provide enough lawyers to fill the need much less at a 
reasonable salary 
a graduating lawyer applying for the fellowship must find a 
public service organization willing to employ him 
skadden arps founded 40 years ago has 177 partners and 675 
associates in seven major us cities and in london and tokyo

the reagan administrations nominee to fill a 
vacancy on the interstate commerce commission assured a senate 
committee tuesday that she would not vote automatically for less 
regulation of the transportation industry 
a blind reliance on deregulation and minimal government 
interference cannot always be relied upon to promote the public 
interest karen borlaug phillips told a senate commerce science 
and transportation committee hearing on her nomination less 
regulation does not necessarily mean no regulation 
phillips 31 the chief economist for republicans on the senate 
finance committee was praised by gop members of the commerce panel 
but several democrats questioned her sharply about her views on 
the adequacy of government regulation of the trucking and railroad 
industries 
sen john d rockefeller dwva the sponsor of legislation 
that would make it easier for shippers to obtain government help in 
forcing railroads to lower their rates complained that monopoly 
is allowed free rein by the icc in some instances today 
the result can be rail rates for hauling grain that are too 
high rates for hauling coal that are too high higher food and 
utility bills for consumers across the country he said 
sen brock adams dwash a former secretary of transportation 
argued against deregulation of the trucking industry 
i dont think its safe now i dont see weigh stations open 
and i dont see inspections taking place adams said 
phillips said she favors further deregulation of the trucking 
industry and has a very open mind generally on rail matters 
sen j james exon dneb chairman of the commerce committees 
surface transportation subcommittee said he supports phillips 
nomination 
i believe on balance this nomination by the president is about 
as good as we could expect he said after the hearing 
phillips was nominated to the 77500ayear job on feb 29 she 
would replace commissioner malcolm mb sterrett whose 
fiveyearterm expired dec 31

tenneco inc the nations 10th biggest oil 
company said tuesday it has received several offers for its oil and 
gas operations since putting them up for sale two weeks ago 
a spokesman declined to discuss details of any of the offers but 
financial analysts have estimated the units could fetch between 5 
billion to 7 billion 
joseph m macrum the tenneco spokesman also would not identify 
any of the bidders except to confirm that an offer had been 
received from gulf financial resources inc a private houstonbased 
investment firm financed by european interests 
gulf financial said monday that it had sent tenneco chairman 
james l ketelsen a letter asking for a meeting to discuss details 
of its undisclosed cash offer 
tenneco announced on may 25 that it wanted to get out of the oil 
and gas business to concentrate on its shipbuilding farm equipment 
auto parts and chemicals operations it said it would use the 
proceeds to reduce its 85 billion debt 
tenneco oil co tennecos energy subsidiary had operating 
income of 233 million on sales of 33 billion last year 
henri a soussan a principal in gulf financial would not reveal 
the offered price or other details concerning the proposal which 
was made to tenneco in a letter last wednesday 
he said the offer was for both the exploration and production and 
the refining and marketing operations of tenneco oil 
we plan to keep them as one entity in an ongoing company 
soussan said we intend to retain the senior management and all 
employees 
soussan declined to identify the european interests that back his 
company he said gulf financial was formed two years ago to make 
real estate acquisitions but had yet to make a purchase 
macrum said gulf financial was one of many firms that had 
expressed an interest in acquiring the oil and gas units 
we have received more than anticipated macrum said he said 
he did not have a definite number but said its a lot very 
extensive 
the sale is being handled by the investment banking firms morgan 
stanley corp and first boston corp 
macrum said the firms are reviewing offers to determine whether 
the bidders have the financial resources 
at some point then we will call for bids and we will evaluate 
them we will then name a winner we hope to do that by the end of 
the year he said

earnings at the nations commerical banks are 
rebounding from the worst year since the depression in every region 
of the country except the southwest the government said tuesday 
the federal deposit insurance corp said the 13541 banks it 
insures collectively earned 5 billion in the first three months of 
this year down somewhat from 53 billion in the same period in 
1987 
however earnings would have hit a new record high if not for the 
huge 149 billion loss at a single dallas bank holding company 
said fdic chairman l william seidman 
banks first quarter losses in the southwest totaled 164 
billion 90 percent of that from first republicbank corp 
the fdic has already pumped 1 billion into first republicbank 
texas largest banking organization and may have to spend another 
1 billion to attract a buyer to take it over 
seidman said the fdic is negotiating with potential investors and 
hoped to put first republicbank back on its feet in the reasonably 
near future 
last year was the worst since the depression for commercial 
banks 184 banks failed a record high and banks as a whole earned 
only 36 billion a record low as big banks added to their 
reserves in anticipation of losses on loans to developing countries 
banks this year are continuing to fail at the 1987 rate 
seventyfive had closed their doors as of last friday 32 of them in 
texas 
but otherwise seidman painted a generally optimistic picture for 
1988 
the number of banks on the fdics problem list has dropped below 
1500 for the first time in two years he said there were 1491 
such institutions at the end of march compared with a peak above 
1600 in mid1987 
the big moneycenter banks have written off about 25 percent to 
30 percent of their third world loans and that alone was responsible 
for much of last years depressed earnings those reserve levels 
still look reasonable he said 
prospects are also looking up for banks in the midwest a region 
where banks were affected by hard times on the farm the percentage 
of midwest banks reporting losses fell from 135 percent in the 
first quarter a year ago to only 76 percent this year 
even in the southwest there is reason for hope seidman said 
twentyseven percent of the banks in the region lost money in the 
first three months of this year compared with 36 percent for all of 
last year 
we expect the worst for texas will be behind us after 1988 
he said the smaller banks in texas are beginning to show some 
improvement nothing large but they are moving in the right 
direction 
seidman also said he believed nationally banks were reasonably 
well protected against rising interest rates and could withstand a 
recession next year provided the downturn is not extraordinarily 
deep or extended 
he described his agencys insurance fund as solid even 
though the price tag on the first republicbank bailout may cause the 
fund to register its first loss since it was established in 1934 
we think we can handle anything we see on the horizon he 
said 
despite record failures and record low earnings commercial banks 
are still in far better shape than the 3120 federally insured 
savings institutions which lost 68 billion last year first 
quarter figures are not yet available for thrifts

the chairman of amtrak said tuesday he is 
confident the passenger railroad will survive and gain the support 
of the next president whether democrat or republican 
congress has rejected proposals to terminate amtrak for 
four successive years w graham claytor told reporters referring 
to repeated attempts by the reagan administration to end federal 
subsidies for the railroad 
amtrak is expected to get about 580 million in federal money 
next year but will cover twothirds of its operating costs through 
various revenue sources claytor said only 48 percent of the rail 
systems costs were covered by revenues in 1981 he said 
the administration repeatedly has called for an end to federal 
subsidies for amtrak but each time congress has continue to provide 
the rail system with reduced amounts of money 
today things are looking better said claytor expressing 
optimism about getting the additional federal funds in future years 
that will allow amtrak to begin expanding its operations 
he said he expects either democrat michael dukakis or vice 
president george bush to support amtrak if elected president 
although bush has yet to say specifically whether he would favor 
increased funding for the railroad 
claytor said his key objective is to have both the democratic and 
republican parties go on record as supporting the continuing need 
for a national passenger rail system im optimistic this will be 
the position of a new administration whether republican or 
democratic he said 
while in recent years amtrak has battled for its survival 
claytor talked during a session with reporters at the national press 
club about expanding services in the years to come 
the principal problem we see ahead is capacity on weekends 
and hoidays we dont have the equipment to accommodate peak loads on 
our unreserved northeast corridor trains between boston and 
washington he said 
claytor said that for the first time in recent years amtrak has 
been on firm enough footing politically to obtain financing for new 
locomotives and train cars 
he said amtrak has arranged financing for the purchase of 18 new 
diesel and electric locomotives and up to 100 new coach cars the 
locomotives are now being delivered and the first 50 coaches will be 
on hand in 12 to 15 months he said

a fast fade at the end 
a midday forecasts of cooler temperatures for the corn belt may

traders have made enough money and were willing to sell and selling 
tends to touch off further selling

quietly sold at least 2 billion during the last week of may such a

the government said tuesday that it would offer the 
stateowned bank girobank for sale to a financial institution 
girobank formally national giro is britains sixthlargest 
bank it was set up in 1968 to cater to the banking needs of 
workingclass britons and is now part of the post office 
industry minister kenneth clarke announced the governments 
latest privatization in the house of commons saying the bank now 
needs to expand vigorously 
the sale of the bank which analysts said could raise 300 million 
pounds or about 543 million is expected to take place by the end 
of the year 
merchant bankers will be in charge of assessing the bids for 
girobank under the guidance of the post office 
the bank which has about 25 million customers had pretax 
profit last year of 231 million british pounds or about 42 
million on revenue of 328 million pounds or 594 million 
it will be important to safeguard close links between 
girobank and post office counters clarke said 
conservative prime minister margaret thatcher has previously 
ruled out the privatization of the nations mail delivery service 
but not of other postal operations 
in addition to the bank and the royal mail the post office also 
oversees a subsidiary which runs the counters where stamps are sold 
parcels weighed and banking services provided 
opposition lawmaker tony benn who as labor government postmaster 
general launched girobank 22 years ago said the privatization of 
the bank was a naked act of plunder of a public asset which had 
been wildly successful 
although the offer price will be a major factor in deciding who 
takes over the bank it will not simply be sold to the highest 
bidder clarke said 
the government will also look at the bidders plans for 
developing the bank the impact of the sale on the post office and 
other factors he said 
clarke signaled government opposition to a takeover of girobank 
by any of the big four commercial banking companies national 
westminster bank plc barclays bank plc midland bank plc and lloyds 
bank plc 
girobank is primarily used as a savings bank by retired and poor 
people who dont need all the services of a retail bank 
girobank issues checks and has post office hours which are 
longer than bank hours it is also used to pay gas electricity and 
other bills as well as to wire money within britain and abroad 
girobank has reached a new fiveyear contract with the counters 
subsidiary through which it operates clarke said 
mrs thatcher has sold off billions of pounds worth of 
stateowned assets primarily through the sale of shares to the 
public as a way of promoting capitalism in britain 
companies sold off include british telecommunications plc the 
phone company which also used to be run by the post office

corn futures advanced strongly and soybeans finished slightly 
higher despite some earlier profit taking tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade 
wheat futures on the other hand fell by a nickel or more per 
bushel 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were mixed energy 
was higher and precious metals declined 
on monday prices on all six agricultural commodities had soared 
the daily permissible limit at the opening at the board of trade and 
stayed there as hot dry weather in the midwest showed no signs of 
letting up 
by contrast commodities futures prices were very volatile on 
tuesday particularly in soybeans 
nonetheless the performance was impressive said rich 
feltes commodity research director in chicago for refco inc 
soybeans had increased more than 1 a bushel in the last week and 
had two consecutive sessions of 30 centlimit gains going into 
tuesdays session 
prices opened sharply higher again sold off almost immediately 
staged a comeback and then faded near the close 
the market was up so sharply it was due to pull back said 
walter spilka an analyst in new york with smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
traders have made enough money and were willing to sell and 
and selling tends to touch off further selling he said 
by days end the july soybean contract had traveled between a 
high of 909 a bushel to a low of 866 and closed with a 3cent 
gain over monday at 882 
wheat futures prices fell however weekly crop reports released 
late monday showed the deterioration in the winter wheat crop which 
is about to be harvested was not as severe as had been expected 
said jerry gidel an analyst in chicago with gh miller amp co 
wheat settled 4 cents to 14 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 378 a bushel corn was 9 cents to 12 cents 
higher with july at 257 a bushel oats were 6 cents to the limit 
15 cents higher with july at 221 a bushel and soybeans were 10 
cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 882 a bushel 
with a relatively subdued performance in grains some upward 
price pressure was taken off livestock futures at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
over the last few sessions the distant delivery months of pork 
and cattle have been pushed higher by the cost of grain said 
charlie richardson an analyst in denver with lindwaldock amp co he 
said traders felt higher feed costs would reduce production of 
broilers and competition for red meat 
hog producers also were expected to slow expansion 
so with the grain market not nearly as wild as it was the last 
two sessions we had some pressure relieved on livestock prices 
said richardson 
live cattle settled 50 cent lower to 85 cent higher with the 
june contract at 7310 cents a pound feeder cattle were 75 cent to 
1 cent higher with august at 7592 cents a pound live hogs were 77 
cent lower to 50 cent higher with june at 5292 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 125 cents lower to 135 cents higher with 
july at 5487 cents a pound 
energy futures moved slightly higher on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
prices were merely rebounding from sizable technical losses the 
day before said nauman barakat an analyst in new york with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
in addition he said there are some rumors that opec is 
going to work out some compromises ministers of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries meet in vienna beginning saturday 
theres been some talk theyll attempt to get iraq back as an 
active member of the cartel he said and also rumors that 
theyre ready to restart a dialog with nonopec nations 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 cents 
higher with the july contract at 1737 a barrel heating oil was 
25 cent to 46 cent higher with july at 4623 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gasoline was 10 cent to 47 cent higher with july at 5020

texaco inc on tuesday promised to give its 
stockholders a third of the 5 billion it expects to raise from 
asset sales as part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan 
the white plains nybased oil giant said the distribution 
would come in the form of a share buyback or some other direct 
shareholder participation or distribution and would be made by 
the end of this year 
the distribution may involve cash or the use of securities in 
anticipation of the proceeds to be realized from the sales 
program texaco said in a statement 
it added that the other twothirds of the proceeds would be used 
to repay debt strengthen the balance sheet and fund increased 
capital investment programs for selected retained operations 
wall street showed little response to the move which came in the 
midst of a proxy fight between texaco and takeover specialist carl 
c icahn 
in consolidated nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted issues texaco closed at 51 per share up 12 cents 
its negative from the stock markets view because its not 
like theyre giving the shareholders something they dont already 
own said richard s pzena who studies oil companies for the 
sanford c bernstein amp co securites firm 
icahn is running a fiveman slate for the board of directors 
hoping to a victory will help him get the board to let shareholders 
vote of a 60pershare cash offer for the company the votes are to 
be cast at texacos annual meeting on june 17 
pzena said that by adding some value to shares already hovering 
in the 50 range texaco in effect was diluting the impact of 
icahns 60 cash offer thereby strengthening its chances of beating 
icahn in the proxy fight 
that amounted to a negative on wall street because 60 is 
better than 50 pzena said 
icahn claimed texacos objective in the move was to do just 
enough to get reelected and then get back to business as usual 
unfortunately texaco management will promise almost anything 
to keep me off the board and keep stockholders from voting for 60 
or better he said in a statement 
texacos latest announcement updated its progress in other 
aspects of its reorganization plan it came just 24 hours after it 
said it had agreed to sell its 9912 percent interest in deutsche 
texaco ag of west germany to a major utility in that country 
rheinishwestfaelisches elektrizitaetswerk ag also known as rwe 
agreed to pay over 12 billion for the subsidiary both sides 
expect no problems with a requirement that west germanys federal 
cartel office approve the transaction 
in its tuesday announcement texaco said it expected to generate 
more than 18 billion more in two other upcoming transactions one 
is a deal to sell 60 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent 
reserves expected to close by the end of this month the other 
involves proposals to establish joint ventures with certain 
oilproducing countries 
the ventures which were in advanced stages of review would 
involve three texaco refineries and related marketing facilities on 
the east and gulf coasts 
texaco president james w kinnear said the two other countries 
are venezuela and saudi arabia 
the company also said studies were continuing on what to do with 
its 78 percent interest in texaco canada inc including the 
possible sale merger or joint venture of some or all of the stake 
in addition it said it was considering the potential sales of 
other domestic oil and gas properites of marginal value to the 
company as well as certain european and african holdings 
finally the restructuring program is expected to yield more than 
50 million in additional savings in overhead from staff 
consolidations texaco said 
the latest developments are a result of months of negotiations 
that began as texaco prepared for its april emergence from a year 
under chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection 
texaco had filed for that protection a year earlier to avoid 
having to post an 11 billion security bond while appealing a 103 
billion judgment held against it by pennzoil co a jury ruled texaco 
had interfered with pennzoils 1984 attempt to acquire part of getty 
oil co so it could buy getty itself 
texaco agreed in december to settle the suit by paying 3 billion 
to pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included sales of 
3 billion worth of assets 
soon afterward icahn its largest stockholder with 148 percent 
of the companys shares stepped up pressure on texacos management 
to do more to increase the value of its stock 
in march he threatened to run his slate of five candidates 
including himself for texacos board if the company did not take 
steps that would raise the price to 55 per share from thencurrent 
levels in the 35to45 range 
in an apparent bid for stockholder support texaco announced the 
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset 
sales to 5 billion a month later 
but icahn unsatisfied proceeded with his 60pershare offer 
for those texaco shares he does not already known and launched his 
threatened proxy fight

the reagan administrations savings and loan 
rescue policy is aimed at protecting the customers money and 
preserving the publics confidence in the system a white house 
spokesman said tuesday 
at the same time marlin fitzwater insisted there was no plan to 
resort to the use of general taxpayers funds to bail out troubled 
institutions he pronounced the white house satisfied with the way 
the federal regulators are handling the problem 
but fred wolf director of accounting and financial management of 
the congressional general accounting office said that considering 
the state of the industry the federal government might have to use 
general taxpayer revenues to shore up the system 
wolf said some 500 savings and loans across the country are 
insolvent and 200 of them are what we would classify as 
hopelessly insolvent 
fitzwater acknowledged that clearly weve got some difficult 
problems in that industry he commented a day after the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp ordered a record 135 billion cash 
bailout payment to customers of two failed california savings and 
loans 
the 135 billion figure represents roughly 40 percent of the 
flsic fund for financial institution rescue attempts analysts have 
said it likely will cost billions more than is in the budget to bail 
out other institutions 
fitzwater when asked about how the bank regulatory agency could 
withstand such financial pressures said fslic has 108 billion in 
borrowing authority over the next three years 
he took issue with estimates it likely would cost as much as 50 
billion to put the industry back on a steady course 
a lot of the sampls that are in trouble are being bought out by 
other companies a lot of them are in bankruptcy and theyre trying 
to work out arrangements for them to stay in business so i dont 
think its fair to suggest that were suddenly have a 50 billion 
bill 
this is not a new problem and its one that is being planned 
for and the regulatory agencies have been handling it well and 
effectively fitzwater said 
but be assured tha protecting the customers money and the 
publics confidence in the system is the first priority of the 
regulatory agencies and thats the way theyre approaching it and 
i think they have a very rational scheme for doing that fitzwater 
added 
he would not say where the money would come from however 
pressed to say whether taxpayers money might eventually be used 
fitzwater said well right now we think the regulatory scheme is 
the regulatory complex is the right way to approach thismoney 
there is a trust fund money goes into it from the banks and from 
the member sampls and at this point thats adequate and we think 
the right way to handle it 
in an interview on abctvs good morning america wolf said 
the government would continue to stand behind the nations troubled 
savings and loan institutions but that eventually could mean having 
to turn to the taxpayers for more money 
i dont know of any other source you could tap wolf said 
the federal government has clearly said that regardless of the 
problems we stand behind the insurance 
but considering the state of the industry if savings 
institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the 
insurance fund theres only one other source and thats 
ultimately the taxpayer wolf said 
fitzwater said right now the situation is being managed and 
well leave it at that

deliberations began tuesday in the case of a 
widower suing three tobacco companies over the lungcancer death of 
his wife who smoked cigarettes for 40 years 
the verdict in the 5yearold case one of a dozen cigarette 
liability cases ever to go to a jury could maintain the 22 
billion industrys unbeaten record in such suits or grant the first 
damages paid to smokers or their relatives 
the sixperson jury contains one smoker two former smokers and 
three people who have never smoked 
us district judge h lee sarokin read instructions on the law 
and claims that the panel must consider sarokin told five alternate 
jurors to remain on hand in case any jurors drop out 
the jurors deliberated for more than four hours before being 
dismissed for the night 
the panel must decide charges by antonio cipollone that lorillard 
inc liggett group inc and philip morris inc contributed to the 
death of his 58yearold wife rose in 1984 
cipollone contends the companies misled the public about the 
dangers of smoking through public relations advertising and 
inadequate research 
sarokin told the jurors they must decide four basic claims 
fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy to do so against each 
company and failure to warn and violation of a warranty against 
liggett 
the warning and warranty claims apply only to liggett because 
mrs cipollone smoked that companys cigarettes before warning 
labels were placed on cigarette packages and advertising in 1966 
courts have ruled that the labels preempt liability claims after 
that date 
sarokin framed the main charge as a claim that the companies 
fraudulently misrepresented material facts to consumers concerning 
significant health risks associated with cigarette smoking 
he said the jury has to determine five things that before 1966 
the company made a false representation that the company knew the 
representation was false that the company meant to deceive people 
that mrs cipollone believed the representation justifiably relied 
on it and was induced to continue smoking and that the 
representation was a proximate cause of her cancer and death 
the phrase proximate cause played a key role in the jury 
instructions sarokin said the panel has to consider whether the 
companies conduct before 1966 was a proximate cause of her smoking 
and then whether the smoking was a proximate cause of her death and 
disease 
the legal term means activity that naturally and probably led 
to and might have been expected to create the condition alleged 
sarokin wrote cipollone doesnt have to prove thatthe companies 
conduct was the only or even main reason why she smoked only that 
it was a substantial contributing factor

the securities and exchange commission has been 
unable to handle a flood of foreignbased insider trading cases 
referred to it in recent years according to information compiled by 
a house subcommittee 
an investigation by the house commerce consumer and monetary 
affairs subcommittee whose results were made available tuesday 
concluded that of 609 suspected insidertrading cases referred by 
the stock exchanges to the sec in 1986 and 1987 about 225 involved 
foreign trading 
of the 225 the sec pursued only 57 the study said 
with the growing internationalization of securities markets 
there is deepening concern that both foreign citizens and americans 
will be able to use foreign accounts to trade illegally in our 
markets by utilizing insider trading information or manipulating the 
market and that the sec may be unable to properly investigate such 
trading subcommittee chairman doug barnard jr dga said in a 
statement 
according to the studys findings the nations stock exchanges 
often take a long time to report suspicious transactions to the sec 
the new york stock exchange takes an average of one year to give 
such information to the sec and has taken up to 28 months the panel 
concluded 
new york exchange spokeswoman sharon gamsin said she would not 
challenge the figures in the report but said the exchange conducts 
its own investigations and is trying to speed the process it uses to 
gather and report information on unusual transactions 
the investigation concluded that the sec does not pursue cases 
involving panama luxembourg liechtenstein and other countries with 
whom the commission lacks informationsharing agreements 
the subcommittee also found that the sec has been looking into 
suspected instances of insidertrading involving international 
business machines corp textron inc sperry corp and other 
companies 
barnard whose subcommittee scheduled a hearing on the subject 
for wednesday said in his statement that the sec has given a low 
priority to international enforcement by assigning only two people 
to its office of international legal assistance 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue declined to comment on the study 
saying commission chairman david s ruder would testify at 
wednesdays hearing 
but in tuesdays edition of the wall street journal which 
initially reported the subcommittees findings gary lynch the 
secs enforcement chief said of the commissions international 
efforts weve been very aggressive and have made remarkable 
strides in the last several years 
the sec on tuesday released a draft of proposed legislation 
designed to increase its ability to combat insidertrading and other 
securities law violations by foreigners 
the bill would give the sec authority to issue subpoenas and take 
testimony in the united states on behalf of foreign securities 
regulators with the idea that other countries in turn would 
provide the same assistance to the sec

universal banking system which would offer a variety of financial 
services to customers around the globe

commercial banks such as the depressionera glasssteagall act in 
the united states were being abolished or reexamined rainer e 
gut chairman of credit suisse in zurich told the international 
monetary conference 
he said the bank of the future will have to change its business 
strategy by becoming more competitive and aggressive 
in the 1990s the typical manager in a successful universal 
bank will be globally oriented have a flair for market 
opportunities and possess entrepreneurial instincts gut said in 
prepared remarks made available to the news media 
the threeday monetary conference in its 34th year provides 
leaders of the top commerical banks and corporations in about two 
dozen countries an opportunity to confer with government officials 
on topics affecting the world economy and international banking 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and other central 
bankers from abroad were scheduled to attend wednesdays closeddoor

some conference participants criticizing the inconsistencies between 
domestic and foreign regulations 
effective governance both domestic and international has not 
kept pace american express co chairman james d robinson iii 
told the conference 
our sites must be set on achieving an environment in which all 
types of financial institutions can compete with adequate rules of 
fair play a credible regulatory framework he said 
robinson said all financial institutions should have fair access 
to the global markets while countries work together to harmonize 
otherwise outdated regulations 
later at a media briefing tuesday several bankers including 
john s reed chairman of citicorp the nations biggest banking 
company briefly discussed the level of regulation among global 
institutions 
philadelphia national bank chairman frederick heldring said big 
banks that take risks shouldnt always expect government protection 
we ultimately could come to a form of chapter 11 federal 
bankruptcy reorganization heldring said if a bank is too large 
to fail it is subject to the risk of becoming an arm of 
government 
reed agreed it makes us more vulnerable to becoming bullied by 
the regulators 
he noted that while government regulators look at the role banks 
play in society the sociology doesnt play in the management 
room we should be allowed to fail as anyone else

which the japanese have been working on for several years will 
revolutionize the tv industry and spin off as many other 
technologies as did videotape and digital recording 
were reminding ourselves of the stakes involved thomson 
said theres a whole lot more involved here than tvs were 
talking about a whole electronics era the tone in the room is 
leading us to the conclusion it is a revolution in electronics 
thats certainly aeas conclusion 
although it is unusual to have competitive companies in the 
united states meet to discuss broad technological ventures and to 
have government involved as well such meetings are common in japan 
the japanese have been at it for 20 years and theyre way 
ahead of us on this technology thomson said

the nations thrift industry is showing more signs of strain but 
the government says the productivity of the nations work force is 
still on the rise 
federal regulators announced a record 135 billion payout to 
close two insolvent savings institutions monday meanwhile the 
labor department reported a big increase in productivity statistics 
for the first quarter 
the federal home loan bank board closed american diversified 
savings bank and north america savings and loan association both of 
costa mesa calif without arranging for a takeover by another 
institution 
only 10 of 235 failed sampls handled since 1981 have been resolved 
with a straight payoff of depositors usually the bank board pays a 
bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick sampl or arranges to transfer 
deposits to another institution 
but bank board chairman m danny wall said the thrifts had little 
value as going concerns because they had few retail deposits and 
lacked branch offices both also relied on highcost shortterm 
deposits arranged through brokers which they in turn lent out for 
speculative real estate ventures and other risky investments 
the institutions have been insolvent for some time regulators 
took over the management of american diversified in february 1986 
and of north america savings in january 1987 
wall said the bank board is paying 114 billion from the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp to american diversified depositors 
the largest cash payout the agency has ever made it is covering 
209 million in deposits at north america savings 
deposits up to the insurance limit of 100000 will be available

texaco inc has agreed to sell its west german 
subsidiary to that countrys largest utility in a deal worth 
slightly more than 12 billion the two companies said 
the sale of texacos 9912 percent interest in deutsche texaco ag 
to rheinishwestfaelisches elektrizitaetswerk ag also known as rwe 
represents the first part of a 5 billion restructuring plan by this 
nations thirdlargest oil company 
rwe said at its essen headquarters that it would pay 123 
billion to close the deal which was signed monday in luxembourg and 
which is subject to approval by the west german federal cartel 
office both sides said they expected no problems with the german 
authorities 
it will become effective five days after the permission arrives 
probably by the end of the month rwe spokesman friedhelm gieske 
said 
texaco began negotiating the sale months ago as it prepared for 
its april emergence from a year under chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
protection 
the white plains nybased oil giant had filed for that 
protection a year earlier to avoid having to post an 11 billion 
security bond while appealing a 103 billion judgment held against 
it by pennzoil co a jury ruled texaco had interfered with 
pennzoils 1984 attempt to acquire part of getty oil co so it could 
buy getty itself 
in december texaco agreed to settle the suit by paying 3 
billion to pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included 
sales of 3 billion worth of assets 
soon afterward takeover artist carl c icahn its largest 
stockholder with 148 percent of the companys shares stepped up 
pressure on texacos management to do more to increase the value of 
its stock 
in march he threatened to run a slate of five candidates 
including himself for texacos board if the company did not take 
steps that would raise the price to 55 per share from thencurrent 
levels in the 30to40 range 
texaco in an apparent bid for stockholder support announced the 
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset 
sales to 5 billion a month later 
but icahn was not satisfied recently he offered 60 per share 
for those texaco shares he does not already known and launched his 
threatened proxy fight for the five seats on the companys board 
the results will be announced at texacos annual meeting on june 17 
texacos stock meanwhile has continued to hover at levels near 
50 per share as icahn kept up his attacks on its management 
commenting on the deutsche texaco sale james w kinnear 
president of the parent company apparently had those criticisms in 
mind 
the proceeds from this transaction together with those from 
other imminent asset sales and joint venture partnerships will be 
providing real benefits to our shareholders he said in a 
statement we are committed to significantly enhancing the value 
of our shareholders investment 
exactly how texaco shareholders would benefit from the sale 
kinnear did not say there has been speculation that it might issue 
a special dividend to shareholders or disburse the proceeds in some 
other manner 
on monday texacos stock rose 87 cents a share to close at 
5087 in trading on the new york stock exchange 
as part of its restructuring texaco has also been negotiating 
the sale of 60 million barrels of us oil and natural gas reserves 
and has been talking with saudi arabia about establishing joint 
ventures involving east and gulfcoast refining and marketing 
interests 
rwe west germanys eighthlargest corporation is active in the 
production and supply of electricity brown coal mining and the 
petroleum and chemicals businesses texaco said 
it said it acquired deutsche texaco in the mid1960s the german 
company is active in all phases of the oil business from 
exploration and production to petrochemicals 
it owns two refineries capable of producing 140000 barrels 
daily and holds a 102 percent share of the west german retail 
gasoline market with about 1900 texacobranded retail outlets

the courtroom is likely to be the scene of the 
next encounter between texas billionaire robert m bass and 
macmillan inc the giant publishing company he has offered to buy 
for 19 billion or 73 a share 
bass filed a lawsuit monday after macmillan failed to respond to 
his latest offer but macmillan had already filed its own suit 
charging bass with securities laws violations 
going to court clearly makes this unfriendly but it already 
really was said bruce thorp an analyst with provident national 
bank in philadelphia 
on wall street macmillan jumped 350 a share to 75 in trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
analysts were nonplussed by the legal developments and said it is 
likely the bass suit will delay the restructuring dividend macmillan 
plans to begin paying shareholders on friday 
the macmillan board which rejected basss initial 64ashare 
offer as inadequate adopted a plan to split the companys 
publishing and nonpublishing operations into two separate publicly 
owned corporations 
part of the plan includes paying shareholders a special dividend 
of 5235 a share 
in a suit filed monday in chancery court in delaware bass is 
seeking to block the company from proceeding with the payout 
in what analysts characterized as a further attempt to appease 
management bass alternatively offered to restructure the company 
along the lines of a plan macmillan unveiled last week but on terms 
more favorable to shareholders he is offering a payout of 58 a 
share 
bass representatives made the proposals at a meeting over the 
weekend with macmillans investment bankers and requested a response 
by noon monday 
but macmillan allowed the deadline to tick by saying in a 
statement it would consider the proposal later in the week 
in its suit filed monday morning in federal court for the 
southern district of new york macmillan charged bass with 
repeated filing and public dissemination of misleading statements 
in order to engage in creeping tender offers 
the suit further claims that the defendants were so anxious to 
hide their intent to deceive macmillan and its shareholders and to 
manipulate the market in macmillan shares that on or about oct 13 
1987 the broker who was placing defendants orders for macmillan 
shares falsely stated that he was acting on behalf of macmillan 
itself 
the bass group holds about 91 percent of macmillans roughly 26 
million outstanding shares the stake was built between august 1987 
and last month according to the lawsuit 
neither side would comment further on the latest developments 
analysts had predicted the battle would move to the courtroom 
it was a logical reaction for both sides to what was going on 
said berk boksen an analyst with raymond james amp associates in st 
petersburg fla 
there has been considerable speculation that a third party might 
surface and that remains a possibility analysts say 
but with both bass and macmillan putting short deadlines it 
puts a squeeze on anybody new coming in thorp said 
separately macmillan disclosed that an entity related to the 
bass group has requested government approval to acquire more than 
50 percent of macmillans outstanding shares

the world economy is on a much more solid 
footing thanks to past efforts among major industrialized nations 
to coordinate international policies us treasury secretary james 
a baker iii says 
baker told a gathering of bankers and businessmen attending the 
34th annual international monetary conference which began monday 
and runs through wednesday that inflation remained low and trade 
imbalances were narrowing because of global harmony 
in fact he said by working together to stabilize exchange rates 
and coordinate economic policies the major industrialized nations 
withstood the worst effects of last octobers global stock market 
collapse 
it would have been easy for each of us to turn inward and focus 
on shortterm measures to address immediate domestic needs baker 
said monday 
instead he said the nations pulled together and intensified 
efforts to find a compatible and reinforcing set of policies to 
achieve common goals 
since that time strengthened underlying policy actions have 
been reflected in enhanced stability of exchange markets he said 
the world economy is on a much more solid footing 
while many conference participants echoed those sentiments 
monday others called upon corporate america to work more on its own 
to sharpen overseas competitiveness 
of course american industry owes a large part of these 
improvements to the weakness of the us dollar but the 
supportive strength of the exchange rates can fade as fast as it has 
arrived said west german businessmen dieter spethmann chairman 
of thyssen ag in dusseldorf in prepared remarks 
he said us businesses have more going for them than some of 
their foreign competitors including a mobile labor force flexible 
labor costs favorable energy costs and the largest single market in 
the world 
yotaro kobayashi president of fuji xerox co ltd in tokyo 
said for survival in this volatile global business environment 
not only american corporations but businesses around the world are 
making significant efforts to expand from their geographic area of 
strength into other major markets of the world 
the international monetary conference seeks to provide leaders of 
the top commercial banks and businesses in about 20 different 
countries with a chance to confer with government officials on 
topics affecting the world economy as a whole and the international 
banking industry in particular 
besides baker federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and other 
central bankers were among those scheduled to attend closeddoor 
think sessions and speeches 
at the opening sessions monday the main theme was global 
cooperation and competitiveness 
if a deficit country reins in domestic consumption too much a 
recession can result said walter seipp president of the imc in 
a prepared statement on the other hand if domestic demand in 
surplus countries is stimulated too much this could then create the 
threat of renewed inflation 
michel camdessus chairman of the washingtonbased international 
monetary fund agreed each of the problems in question is a 
matter of common concern in that each has spillover consequences 
for the other 
the bankers though said politics was among the obstacles 
standing in the way of global harmony 
even when there is agreement on the objectives there may 
well be difficulties in undoing arduously worked out domestic 
compromises or in obtaining timely domestic action where 
policymaking is decentralized camdessus said 
specifically he called upon the united states to reduce its 
large federal budget deficit as a way of keeping interest rates down 
and narrowing its trade gap he also said europe and japan should 
work toward stimulating their economies 
in his address monday baker said steps taken beginning in 
september 1985 to adjust currency rates were largely responsible for 
improved economic conditions today 
at that time the united states and its four major trading 
partners agreed to devalue the dollar to help reduce the spiraling 
us trade deficit and stave off protectionist legislation last 
year however that same group agreed that further declines in the 
dollars value would be counterproductive 
baker noted the most recent march trade figures showed 
significant improvement dropping to 97 billion its lowest level 
in three years on the strength of record us exports 
the success of the 1985 gathering created certain 
momentum that led to further progress baker said pointing to 
other subsequent meetings

plant floor on up contributed immensely to saving the company 
bieber said 
another sign that chrysler is recovered from the financial 
problems that pushed it toward bankruptcy in 1979 is the realignment 
of the chrysleruaw contract with those at general motors corp and 
ford motor co stepp said 
the common expiration date of national labor agreements at the 
big three gives the union an advantage in picking a company to 
target for a pattern agreement stepp said chrysler workers were 
hurt financially by being out of synch with gm and ford but under 
the circumstances there was no choice 
many of the benefits the chrysler workers would have gotten had 
to go by the wayside because we had to work to save the company 
stepp said 
they are back making profits and they are back on a level 
playing field as lee points out so they can get back to the 
business of competing he said 
chrysler vice president anthony st john said the two sides 
recognize chryslers mission 
i think we all realize were in a very competitive ball game in 
the future and thats going to result in good cooperative efforts to 
make sure we stay in the ball game he said 
the agreement covering 66000 workers took effect may 16 after 
being approved by just 54 percent of the covered workers one unit 
the skilled trades workers voted down the agreement but their 
objections were dealt with 
i dont think we should dwell on the question of percentage 
bieber said its a question now of what happens from this point 
forward 
chrylser and the uaw began early negotiations april 18 as a way 
to calm rising tensions brought on by chryslers consideration of a 
2 billion offer for its 28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary 
and the companys decision to close a 5500worker assembly plant in 
kenosha wis 
the tentative agreement was reached may 4 and eliminated the 
possibility of a strike in september which observers said would 
have been likely because of the anger of rankandfile workers over 
the proposed acustar sale and the kenosha closing 
bieber said the turmoil during negotiations and that 50 percent 
of the rank and file failed to vote during the ratification process 
contributed to the low percentage of approval

post in the next cabinet if his party wins the september elections 
shes been a great minister one of the best but she has made 
one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that he said 
she is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left 
to do in politics he appointed industry minister thage g 
peterson to act as justice minister until the election 
mrs leijon was forced to quit when the small communist party 
which normally supports carlssons minority government decided 
monday it would join the opposition in a noconfidence vote 
center party leader olof johannson said she hasnt followed 
the rules of the game in our democracy thats why she had to go 
its clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the 
constitution 
she was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since 
the social democrats took office in 1982 
sten wickbom quit in october after a convicted spy escaped while 
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison in 1983 ove rainer 
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes 
mrs leijon was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer 
by training and the first woman to hold the job she favored 
tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against 
terrorism
