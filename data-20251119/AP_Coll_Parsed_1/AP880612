bertha shefton closed her eyes and 
shuddered as she relived the moment 
the 80yearold widow owed 10344 on her water bill and city 
utility truck no 986 had just arrived at her small white stucco 
bungalow to cut off the water 
doing without water would be hard enough for a frail old woman 
in the suffocating subtropical heat and humidity of south florida 
but mrs shefton also cares for a granddaughter who has lost her 
left leg to diabetes and must undergo kidney dialysis three times a 
week 
i tried to explain that somebody had stolen my social security 
check and that id pay the bill as soon as my next check came in 
mrs shefton told a visiting reporter they told me they were 
only doing their job 
it was plain to see those boys didnt want to do it they said 
they were real sorry but it was still awful to watch them drive 
away and know our water had been cut off 
but what the crew did next has made the four men local heroes 
and brought in donations that should make mrs shefton secure for a 
long time they drove back turned the water on and scraped up 
enough cash to pay her bill 
when the word got out about what happened a local plumbing 
contractor volunteered to pay mrs sheftons water bill for a year 
another local company is paying her electric bills said benny 
scott who supervises city water department crews 
scott and the three members of the citys celebrated utility 
crew joe johnson mark craddock and lyn roberts visited mrs 
shefton one recent steamy afternoon they stopped by to say hello 
and see how she was faring 
these are my friends mrs shefton said giving scott a hug 
these fellows are my heroes theyre the ones who started the 
wheels turning for me 
the wheels began turning mrs sheftons way almost immediately 
after the utility truck pulled away from the curb in front of her 
house on april 14 
we decided we just couldnt leave her like that johnson 
said it was the middle of the month and that meant it would be 
more than two weeks before the old ladys next check would arrive 
it was plain that she and her granddaughter really needed help 
cutting off water service in such a climate makes people 
desperate the crew members said 
some of them get real nasty and threaten to shoot you or sic 
their dogs on you said roberts others get down and beg you 
not to do it which only makes it worse 
mrs shefton had merely asked for enough time to fill her 
bathtub and a few pots and pans with water before service was shut 
off 
it really touched me johnson said 
so the crew members called their office on the truck radio and 
found out how much mrs shefton owed then they began pulling money 
out of their pockets 
joe and i each put up 15 and willie hargrett our foreman 
pitched in 20 roberts said some other fellows at the office 
also contributed a few dollars and benny scott put up the 
remaining 3344 
craddock put in a dollar 
but that was every penny he had said roberts it was a 
gift from his heart 
news media soon picked up the story 
since then weve gotten dozens of calls and letters from all 
over the place scott said people from as far away as 
california have sent money and checks for mrs shefton a local guy 
even stopped by and gave us a check for the 10344 we had put up 
scott said he has turned over all the contributions including 
the 10344 check to mrs sheftons church where a fund has been 
set up for her 
so far weve received more than 700 the rev otis sample 
pastor of the mt calvary baptist church said recently well 
use the money to help her pay her bills 
mrs shefton lost her husband izell a year ago and she and 
her granddaughter mercideen pugh 37 live on a monthly income of 
952 
mrs shefton a former domestic worker who cleaned the homes of 
pompano beachs more affluent families for 40 years said she 
doesnt know what to make of all the help and support she has 
received 
its wonderful but dont forget that it all started with 
these boys here she said pointing to johnson roberts craddock 
and scott 
we were happy to do it replied scott who said he too is 
somewhat flabbergasted by all the attention including letters of 
commendation from the mayor 
we didnt have no idea it would turn out like this he said 
we were just trying to help a nice old lady out of a jam

at the end she was alone hiding from the 
world shed shattered that day in wild gunfire outside the tears 
and trauma had just begun inside laurie dann shot one last time 
and her torment was over 
no one saw her place the 32caliber revolver in her mouth or 
heard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of terror 
three weeks after she killed a young boy at hubbard woods 
elementary school and ended her life in the house where she had 
held police at bay authorities are still trying to piece together 
the puzzle of laurie danns life 
we want to answer the question why said winnetka police lt 
joseph sumner what made it happen how did it happen we owe 
that to the citizens and the community we owe it to the families 
of victims if you put yourself in their spot youd want to know 
why 
its very possible she may have taken that to the grave with 
her he added we can hopefully come down with a position of 
this is probably why 
laurie danns road to tragedy was lined with signs of trouble 
ahead most posted in the last two years 
in that time she was divorced forced out of an apartment and 
charged with shoplifting she lied about her name age and 
occupation she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student 
she was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hangup or 
threatening phone calls to her exhusband his family and others 
she was charged once but the case was dropped due to insufficient 
evidence 
students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat under 
seat cushions wore knit gloves when she ate ran her shower for 
hours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where she 
was called psycho and elevator lady 
she was definitely a very very confused woman sumner said 
dangerous too her exhusband and others feared but even as 
they were contacting the fbi prosecutors and police several north 
shore families were unwittingly hiring dann as a babysitter 
two days before the may 20 tragedy arizona prosecutors were 
ready to charge dann with making threatening phone calls to a 
former boyfriend illinois authorities were working a similar case 
the fbi was closing in too 
they moved too late by then dann had killed 8yearold 
nicholas corwin she shot five other children at the school and a 
20yearold man who tried to disarm her when she burst into his 
familys house she barricaded herself there and committed suicide 
i dont see why this had to happen and get this far susan 
taylor her former sisterin law said on abcs nightline 
taylor said dann called her hundreds of times saying things like 
susie susie susie you are going to die 
dann police say left behind a trail of poison 31 packets of 
juice and other foods 29 of them contaminated with arsenic or 
lead sent to her exhusband psychiatrist families she worked 
for two northwestern university fraternity houses and others 
police believe she may once have known someone at the frat 
houses but dont know why she directed her poison at acquaintances 
her gun at strangers 
it wasnt the only paradox in danns life 
children she tended adored her but adults came to fear her 
she was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes but she 
left rotting meat behind in one apartment with urinestained floors 
still some say they detected no hint of growing fury 
she really was a pleasant quiet person she wasnt 
this ghoulish person all her life said peter solber one 
attorney who represented her in divorce proceedings she wasnt 
the monster she turned out to be 
for most of her 30 years laurie dann lived an unremarkable life 
laurie wasserman who had an older brother mark graduated from 
prestigious new trier east high school her father a successful 
accountant and mother live in glencoe on the north shore where 
500000 mansions private beaches along lake michigan and 
threecar garages are not uncommon 
in high school she was really quiet kind of withdrawn she 
held her head low said exclassmate margie guiarelli there 
was always kind of a wall inbetween she never really gave you 
eye contact she was nervous when she talked to you 
she took classes at four universities drake arizona 
northwestern and wisconsinmadison over six years at arizona 
she majored in home economics but did not graduate after four 
years later she took courses in acting dance and playwriting 
at arizona dann pledged alpha delta pi sorority where sisters 
remembered her as introverted and recalled how she would make 
several dates for one night then cancel all but one 
i just perceived her to be a sweet little girl denise 
shimer janes a former chapter president told the arizona star 
for two years dann dated a premed student at arizona who later 
claimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls his identity 
has not been made public 
however the mans friend louis spivack an arizona prosecutor 
who doubledated with them remembers dann as aloof perhaps a 
little unfriendly possessive but exhibiting no especially 
strange behavior 
in 1982 two years after returning to the chicago area she 
married russell dann who worked in his familys insurance firm 
solber said his client who was 5foot3 described herself and 
her husband as both little and cute she said they looked like 
brother and sister that was her perception 
the danns bought a 275000 home but the marriage crumbled by 
1986 she saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage 
their parting was bitter dann who had taken a marksmanship 
course in her college days bought a 357caliber magnum saying 
she needed it for protection a worried russell dann alerted 
police who contacted her parents wasserman told officers the gun 
would be locked in a safety deposit box 
the 357 was one of three guns she carried into the school 
dann also accused her husband of assault breaking into their 
home and setting it on fire charges never substantiated 
russell dann in turn asserted she sneaked into his apartment 
as he slept sept 30 1986 and stabbed him in the chest with an 
ice pick he said he never saw his assailant and later claimed his 
exwife had admitted to the attack 
but russell failed a lie detector test and refused to take a 
second while laurie passed said michael waller assistant lake 
county states attorney

police found packaging for an ice pick in the house the danns 
had shared but waller said no fingerprints were on the pick 
itself waller also said reports indicated the doctor and nurse who 
treated russell at the hospital noted the wound could have been 
selfinflicted 
no charges were filed there was just no case there waller 
said 
according to divorce records dann was to receive a lump sum of 
125000 and 1250 monthly for three years 
after the shootings russell dann appeared on nightline at 
his request and phoned a radio talk show to urge tougher gun 
control since then he has declined further comment 
he did acknowledge to the associated press however that some 
people think i was the bad guy 
laurie danns life began unraveling faster and faster in 1986 
that summer she dated john childs whose mother alexandra 
lived near her parents she was very pretty very preppy 
but very shy mrs childs said and had unusual habits she 
washed her hands often and touched things only with a napkin 
she said her son noticed too many problems shed be very 
friendly then it would be dont touch me dont touch me 
that fall spivack said his friend now a doctor began getting 
harassing calls he believed were from dann six years after their 
breakup 
spivack said dann somehow obtained the doctors unlisted number 
the fbi said she knew where the doctor was working spivack said 
the calls stopped in 1987 after an attorney wrote a letter to her 
parents home 
last summer danns father intervened when northwestern 
university officials reacting to repeated harassment complaints 
including reports she left raw meat under lounge cushions moved to 
evict her she left the graduate student apartment she was 
subletting 
dann then posted notices in local groceries seeking babysitting 
jobs many families said she had a terrific rapport with children 
but wasserman twice made restitution to employer families after his 
daughter was suspected of stealing food or clothes police say 
in january dann moved to the towers in madison wis a 
dormitory one block off the university of wisconsin campus most 
residents were freshmen more than a decade younger than dann 
her suitemate said dann told her she was a journalism student 
from northwestern but she never carried books or attended classes 
dann explained to dorm neighbors she wore gloves when she ate 
because she was allergic or sensitive to metal objects 
the suitemate who asked not to be identified said after 
several incidents she became uncomfortable and moved out 
other residents say dann avoided sidewalk cracks watched tv all 
day and rode the elevators for hours carrying a note pad student 
brian soifer said he heard she wept once when some guys teased her 
on the elevator 
everybody told stories about her he said she must have 
known people were pointing at her and talking about her 
she just looked like she was lost said resident scott 
tzinberg 
amid mounting harassment complaints meanwhile the 
investigations continued 
waller said december phone records showed that 55 predawn calls 
lasting a minute or less were made in 4 hours from the wasserman 
home 
in march dann reportedly stopped seeing her psychiatrist who 
had prescribed lithium carbonate to treat depression she was also 
taking an experimental drug called clomipramine used for 
obsessivecompulsive disorders 
that month a woman who had known the danns when they were 
married and had received hundreds of hangup calls since 1986 
picked up her phone to hear you are going to die the woman who 
asked that her name not be used suspected dann in all the calls 
on march 14 dann was arrested in madison accused of stealing 
four wigs and other items said capt jeff frye he said dann 
initially gave police a fake name and a michigan address once she 
gave her real name she still gave phony information on her student 
status and address he said 
on may 9 spivack said his friend answered the phone and heard a 
female voice say she would come out and stab them and make it 
look like his wife had done it the fbi was given a 
taperecording of the call 
the night of may 15 frye said dann was found in a dormitory 
trash room curled in a fetal position wrapped in a plastic bag and 
dripping with sweat 
when police arrived however she was asleep in her room aware 
of the arizona investigation the fbi was called they arrived the 
next morning she was gone 
after the shooting police searched her belongings and found a 
picture of her with her exhusband scraps of paper with names 
rough drafts of threatening notes to the arizona doctor supportive 
letters from her parents four catalog cards from a library 
referring to books on poisoning a list of words including 
schools and both and a white smock she apparently took 
from a hospital where shed been treated as an outpatient said fbi 
agent kent miller in madison 
miller said dann was suspected of stealing arsenic and other 
chemicals from a hospital lab in march 
plans in arizona to seek an indictment may 18 were delayed to 
coordinate legal action with other states 
two days later laurie dann wearing a university of arizona 
medical center shirt with a skeleton on it reached the end of her 
road to tragedy 
i feel very frustrated spivack said we were within a few

inside the beltway that circles 
washington house speaker jim wright is the target of a barrage of 
charges of ethical misconduct but inside loop 820 that circles 
fort worth his home district its business as usual 
aides in wrights texas office arent hearing complaints about 
the congressman they say just the usual requests from 
constituents seeking help with social security checks or a passport 
and local republican leaders say the charges alone wont hurt 
the powerful democrat 
where theres a lot of smoke you ought to at least look for 
the fire but i dont think the smoke is going to cause him 
problems said jim ryan gop chairman in tarrant county 
ryan said the ethics investigation may plow him under or 
vindicate him and make him a hero 
the house ethics committee voted unanimously friday to 
investigate charges lodged by wrights political enemy rep newt 
gingrich rga and common cause a nonprofit group that monitors 
government ethics 
they allege that wright lobbied on behalf of oil interests in a 
case in which he had a financial stake that he received unusually 
high royalties for a book he wrote that was published in 1985 by a 
longtime associate and campaign contractor that he used a capitol 
hill staffer and office funds to help draft the book and that he 
used a fort worth condominium owned by the family of a business 
partner without having to pay a monthly rent 
larry shannon who directs wrights district office said 
thursday the office has received 12 telephone calls in the past two 
weeks concerning the salvo of charges fired gingrich 
of those 12 two were negative while the rest were encouraging 
similar to comments shannon said he received while making rounds in 
the conservative 12th district that stretches over the northern 
twothirds of tarrant county 
the district about 30 miles west of dallas is known for its 
rowdy frontier image exemplified by its fort worth stockyards 
tourist attraction 
but the citys collar has whitened with hightechnology 
industries such as tandy corp bell helicopter and general 
dynamics 
local democrats say their republican counterparts have little to 
complain about because wright has been an effective congressman for 
the district 
since his arrival in congress in 1955 wright has been a 
prodigious provider of federal dollars for fort worth especially 
in the form of defense contracts and he has one of the most 
politically safe districts in the nation he faces no republican 
opponent in the november election 
he is a supporter of his friends even his republican 
friends said frank barron a longtime tarrant county democrat 
wright and other democrats say the charges are part of a gop 
plot to embarrass wright and the party before the democratic 
national convention next month in atlanta and to take pressure off 
vice president george bush and attorney general edwin meese iii 
wright has been named chairman of the convention 
shannon said that when he was eating at a restaurant a man 
approached him and said theyre picking on that boy of ours up 
there arent they you tell them to leave him alone 
recently constituent john ridgeway went to wrights fort worth 
office to see if the staff could help him find a certain kind of 
government stamp for his sons stamp collection ridgeway 39 said 
the ethics charges dont bother him 
i read the newspapers every day but the fact is i dont think 
we could have a better person up there hes done a lot for the 
area he said 
ridgeway dismissed the ethics charges as based on politics 
every four years someone up there has to start slinging mud he 
said

on a small dairy farm tucked under the canadian 
border the for sale sign has come down vermonters worried 
that the small farmer might become an endangered species hope it 
is the beginning of a trend 
what prompted gary jacobs to change his mind and stay on his 
100cow farm was the promise of 5000 cash this year from the 
state 
most of vermonts 2700 farmers are eligible for the subsidy 
under the first such program ever enacted by a state farmers have 
until wednesday to apply a maximum of 5000 will be paid each 
farmer 
the subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such a 
large role in the heritage of one of the nations most rural states 
would soon vanish from the landscape 
the fear was wellfounded 10 percent of vermonts 3000 farms 
went out of business in the past two years 
its viewed as being rather revolutionary said vermont 
agriculture commissioner ronald allbee of the new program its 
viewed as i cant believe vermont did it 
i think this is a ray of sunlight to all the dairy farmers in 
the state of vermont said ronald morrissette of east randolph 
the first to sign up for the subsidy 
the problem facing dairy farmers was simple the price of milk 
was falling costs were rising between 1981 and 1987 the price 
farmers received for their milk declined in real dollars from 
1390 to 1243 per hundred pounds of milk more than 40 percent 
of the farms in the state were operating below the breakeven point 
the culprit was a federal policy designed to reduce a milk 
surplus in the west the policy farmers said was ruining dairy 
farms in new england where there was a shortage of milk 
as 1988 began vermont farmers endured another reduction in the 
federal price support the price the federal ensures farmers for 
their milk and faced the prospect of more cuts the state decided 
to step in 
at first gov madeleine kunin opposed the oneyear 75 million 
program as bad fiscal policy that wouldnt give farmers the 
longterm help they needed 
but lawmakers and citizens groups seeing state coffers 
overflowing from a strong economy rallied around the subsidy 
concerned that the loss of farmers and farmland would change the 
face of vermont and remove land treasured for hunting fishing 
trapping and sightseeing 
theyre the custodians of the countryside state sen 
francis howrigan chairman of the senate agriculture committee 
said of the farmers 
the subsidy program will pay farmers 50 cents for every hundred 
pounds of milk they produce up to 1 million pounds which is more 
than the average farm produces its available to farmers who 
receive at least half their gross income from farming make less 
than 32000 a year and belong to a milk cooperative or an 
11state dairy cartel thats trying to win a higher milk price for 
northeast farmers 
the program faces a legal challenge from a group of farmers who 
say the program discriminates against those few who do not belong 
to coops 
the legislature this year also enacted some longterm help for 
farmers that will give them big breaks on their property taxes in 
future years the state will pay up to approximately 90 percent of 
farmers local property taxes if they agree to continue farming 
the tax program covers all nondairy farmers this year next 
year when the dairy subsidy is eliminated it will apply to dairy 
farmers 
but lawmakers and farmers say the state cannot afford to 
continue its 75 million subsidy and that the true solution can 
come only from the congress 
its the finger in a dike that is getting an everwider 
fissure said new hampshire agriculture commissioner stephen 
taylor i think were in a dire situation and i dont think the 
state of vermont has the resources to carry that farmer for a long 
period of time 
jacobs expects to triple the value of his 5000 payment from 
the state by using it to grow feed one of his rapidly rising 
expenses 
its going to make a difference and it gives you a chance 
he said surveying the corn field that lies in the shadow of jay 
peak a popular ski area it may turn around

stephen cox is off to see the munchkins the 
wonderful munchkins of oz but he has no yellow brick road to 
follow in his search for the little people who greeted dorothy in 
the 1939 film the wizard of oz 
it may not be easy to find some of them said the writer 
i know there are some still living but theyve sort of fallen 
into the woodwork 
cox is writing a book about the little people who sang and 
danced with the young judy garland in the musical based on l frank 
baums magical tale of good and bad witches a bumbling wizard and 
dorothys lovable friends the scarecrow tin man and cowardly lion 
coxs book oz remembered memoirs of the munchkins will be 
published by ep dutton of new york and released next year to 
coincide with the 50th anniversary of the mgm movie classic 
there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are 
fascinated by the munchkins said jeanne martinet a dutton 
editor 
so far cox has located about 30 of the 124 people who played 
munchkinland villagers and soldiers he has spent days poring over 
telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but 
old address books and faded signin sheets from longago lunches on 
the movies set 
i figure its about time to give them some credit cox said 
adding that the movie credits gave them little mention all it 
said was the singer midgets as the munchkins their scene lasts 
about 10 minutes but i think its the most enchanting part of the 
whole movie 
for margaret pellegrini being a munchkin meant a chance to meet 
movie stars and other people of her size 
she was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now she 
said recently from her home in glendale ariz meeting up with 
all the little people because i hadnt been around very many 
little people it was just a great experience 
i didnt think it would be so popular of course i was 
excited about it and i was thinking oh boy im going to 
hollywood 
a lot of the munchkins think a book on the munchkins is that 
really going to sell cox said they dont realize how popular 
they are 
most of the men and women who played the munchkins were 
recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by leo singer 
and major doyle but many of them had never acted before and some 
were from europe and didnt speak english cox said 
a few of them went on in show business but most eventually 
settled into other jobs he said 
mickey carroll of st louis now 69 continued acting for a 
time then returned home to the family business selling grave 
monuments parnell st aubin opened a tavern in chicago called the 
midgets club and walked along the bar serving drinks meinhardt 
raabe went on to portray little oscar for oscar mayer lunchmeats 
and made promotional appearances around the country 
theyre all proud of their parts in the wizard of oz cox 
said theyre proud of being a part of one of the best motion 
pictures ever made a new generation discovers the wizard of oz 
every year 
but for all the fond memories of working with miss garland and 
the other stars there were problems cox said 
pellegrini recalled heavy elaborate costumes and layers of 
makeup lewis croft of idaho falls idaho remembered how it 
smarted when the plastic skin that made the men look bald was 
ripped off like a piece of tape at the end of each day 
cox said he has heard a story about one munchkin an actor 
nicknamed the count and wellknown for his drinking who 
visited the bathroom one day and wound up falling into the toilet 
and being stuck there for 45 minutes 
some of the little people are telling tall tales he said 
but some of its good for legends

gov mario cuomo has a 900 million problem 
california gov george deukmejians is 2 billion and democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis just grew to more than 400 
million in massachusetts 
state budget deficits are sweeping the nation as a result of 
what almost everyone thought was a good idea federal tax reform 
that has resulted in a slump in capital gains tax collections 
north carolina gov jim martin announced last week that he would 
have to pare as much as 60 million from his budget proposal 
because of a oneshot revenue slump brought on by 
lowerthanexpected tax collections 
connecticut budget chief anthony milano warned state agencies 
last week that sluggish revenue collections could mean the state 
will start its new fiscal year july 1 with a deficit 
in pennsylvania state officials say that total revenues are up 
but that taxes on sales of personal investments also known as 
capital gains are down about 8 percent 
there are indications that other states that rely heavily on 
personal income taxes for revenue may have similar problems as the 
year goes on said dall forsythe cuomos budget director 
cuomo has even proposed cutting funding for the states council 
on children and families which is run by his wife matilda 
most states reaped tax revenue windfalls from 1986 when 
investors rushed to take advantage of tax breaks that the new 
federal rules were designed to erase when they took effect jan 1 
1987 
then the tax changes sent taxpayers running to their accountants 
for help in reducing their taxes and the taking of capital gains 
slowed reducing capital gains tax revenues 
in some states such as pennsylvania budget officials lowered 
their revenue estimates forthis year in anticipation of a possible 
shortfall 
the pennsylvania chamber of business and industry complained 
that gov robert caseys administration was not liberal enough in 
estimating the benefits of federal tax reform 
we had a discussion with the pennsylvania chamber on how much 
of a windfall we would get and we said none said karl ross 
caseys deputy secretary for policy and analysis thats what we 
budgeted for and thats whats happening 
the fiscal problems are causing political headaches for dukakis 
and deukmejian 
dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee based his 
campaign on his abilities as a manager he must now cut his budget 
because his numbers were wrong 
republican deukmejian who has been mentioned as a possible 
running mate for george bush had proposed 800 million in revenue 
raisers to help close his budget gap estimated at about 1 billion 
this year and 1 billion next year but he withdrew the proposal 
angry at reporters for calling it a tax increase 
democrat cuomo doesnt have to run for reelection until 1990 
and has been quick to propose some politically unpopular spending 
cuts 
cuomo said last week that the shortfall could present a good 
lesson for this years presidential campaign by demonstrating the 
different approaches for dealing with it 
the deficit he has is just the right size cuomo said of 
dukakis i think this is a break for dukakis he will now show 
you how he handles a deficit he will do it swiftly cleanly 
effectively 
massachusetts democratcontrolled legislature has tentatively 
passed a 40 million cigarette tax hike and a revision of state tax 
law to conform it to federal law that would increase personal 
income taxes by 70 million this year dukakis is not yet committed 
to the cigarette tax 
there have also been cursory discussions of other sin taxes 
on liquor and entertainment to close massachusetts 400 million 
shortfall 
dukakis already has ordered that 233 million in spending be 
postponed that state employment be frozen and that agencies 
prepare for possible personnel cuts through attrition 
massachusetts total budget is about 11 billion 
cuomo last week proposed 406 million in program cuts and 
costsavings from the 442 billionplus budget the legislature 
adopted less than two months ago he also wants to make use of a 
650 million fund that ironically was created with the 1986 tax 
windfall and set aside for lowincome housing and highway projects 
cuomo has among other things ordered a hiring freeze for state 
agencies and proposed increasing tuition for outofstate students 
at new yorks public colleges hes called for the elimination of 
the state polices sixhorse mounted patrol a favorite at fairs 
throughout new york 
cuomo has refused to call for tax increases or even a delay of 
tax cuts enacted last year even though at the time he suggested 
the cuts might be too generous

communist guerrillas fighting in 
cambodia said in a broadcast available sunday that they killed or 
wounded nearly 3000 vietnamese soldiers during may 
the claim contradicted earlier pronouncements by hanoi which 
said fighting had died down and it could therefore begin 
withdrawing troops 
the clandestine khmer rouge radio said 2821 vietnamese soldiers 
had been killed or wounded during the first month of the 10th rainy 
season of the war it said hanois administrative networks had been 
dismantled in 537 villages 11 communes and one township 
past rainy seasons have usually favored the guerrillas who are 
fighting the mechanized conventional forces vietnam has maintained 
in cambodia since its late 1978 invasion 
they lack both fighting forces and food supplies and their 
aggressor soldiers are increasingly demoralized said the 
broadcast made available in bangkok in sum the vietnamese have 
failed and are a complete impasse 
vietnam however has announced that a greatly improved security 
situation in cambodia would allow it to pull 50000 troops out of 
cambodia over the next seven months the partial withdrawal may 
begin late this month 
western analysts who are generally skeptical of khmer rouge 
claims say there has been a sharp drop in fighting in cambodia in 
recent months they speculated that the khmer rouge and other 
guerrilla groups may be stockpiling weapons and positioning 
themselves for a big push when hanois forces are scaled down 
the khmer rouge ousted from power by the vietnamese are allied 
to two noncommunist groups in a loose coalition

mississippi state troopers and social 
workers saturday were still seeking dozens of youngsters who fled a 
baptist boarding school moments before authorities investigating 
allegations of abuse could take them into state custody 
sixtyfour residents of the bethel home for children in 
lucedale about 100 miles to the southeast were taken to the 
mississippi state hospital here most arrived friday night while 
others arrived at the psychiatric hospital saturday 
some of the children ages 8 through 17 were found in private 
homes restaurants and along the streets of lucedale 
most of the 120 to 160 students at the school had fled friday 
before state social workers arrived to carry out a court order 
assigning the state temporary custody of the children 
the whereabouts of the remaining children was not known 
saturday and state welfare officials said they might be in hiding 
the homes operator the rev herman fountain said saturday he 
is sheltering four or five youngsters who fled he also said in a 
telephone interview from lucedale that he had taken a new teenage 
boy into the bethel home on saturday and would continue to take any 
children dropped off by parents the biloxi sunherald reported in 
its sunday editions 
ive still got a few soldiers left and im trying to work 
back to what it was before fountain said 
the judge who issued the order said there was reason to suspect 
physical and mental abuse of students complaints by former 
residents of the home ranged from severe beatings to forced labor 
some children received excessive corporal punishment and no 
medical care and were harassed by other children at the home state 
welfare commissioner thomas brittain said saturday 
as to any new residents taken in by fountain brittain said the 
state would await orders from the judge robert oswald of 
pascagoula 
oswald said he wouldnt indicate how hell deal with the 
development until monday when a court hearing is scheduled in the 
case 
fountain 38 said in the interview that he became a minister 
after god saved him from heroin addiction in new york city in 1972 
and that he opened the bethel home for children in 1979 
he denied telling the children to run away from the home when 
welfare officials arrived 
the children are in here mainly for runaways stealing 
homosexuality we have little girls who are whores fountain 
said adding that strict discipline is required for such youths 
the parents have lost control kids today are such 
manipulators such cons especially a child from a divorce theyve 
learned how to manipulate their parents he said 
by saturday evening brittain said he had released 10 children 
to their parents he said he expected to keep interviewing parents 
saturday and sunday by monday he said he hoped to arrange the 
return of almost all the children 
eric parker 16 was among the students who screamed angrily at 
welfare department workers and state troopers when they arrived 
friday 
you have no right he yelled i want to be here with my 
people i dont want to be with all the rest of you people who hate 
the truth you better check yourself and make sure you are not 
burning on the way to hell 
the home is on the grounds of bethel baptist church which is 
not affiliated with any formal group 
authorities are not sure how many students were at the home 
because they have not seen its records and were not been able to 
contact fountain since friday brittain said 
the missing children might have been moved secretly to another 
location by fountain he said 
we have a suspicion in that direction but dont like to make 
a confirmation one way or another until we are sure brittain 
said 
brittain said he had met with parents or more than a dozen 
children but did not return children to some who refused to answer 
questions 
we indicated to them that until they did they had better make 
some other arrangements for their children brittain said 
state officials said they hoped that the children would be 
released to their parents or guardians as soon as possible 
officials telephoned parents and guardians and set up a special 
line for them 
hospital officials reported handling calls from parents as far 
away as oregon and new hampshire 
we started getting calls just after lunch friday said 
spokeswoman wynona winfield yes you can say its been busy 
busy busy 
oswald ruled friday afternoon that he was turning over custody 
of the residents to the state the independent baptist boarding 
school has come under fire several times since 1980 
a physician testified during a hearing into the welfare of one 
child who ran away from the home that during a 19month stay at 
bethel the child did not receive medical treatment for an eye 
condition that could have left him blind 
doctors at the state hospital helped conduct medical 
examinations of the children but would not comment on their 
condition winfield said 
a court hearing is set for monday in the case 
the state hospital was chosen to house the children because of 
readily available living space food services recreational 
facilities and medical and crisis intervention services brittain 
said 
the children will have no contact with patients officials said 
boys slept friday night on mattresses in the gymnasium while the 
girls stayed in a vacant dormitory 
minutes after oswald issued his order at 11 am friday state 
welfare department personnel arrived at the home the youths 
apparently were alerted about the court order and most had fled 
i didnt tell those kids to run fountain said friday 
fountain had been jailed for two days for refusing to give 
officials a list of residents he was released friday without 
providing the information when he agreed to an orderly transfer of 
the children to state custody 
brittain said he didnt know what action if any would be taken 
against fountain

the recent sovietamerican summit widely seen 
as dealing a telling blow to the cold war appears to have had no 
impact on the continuing struggle between the two countries over 
nicaragua 
just a week after president reagan bade a warm farewell to 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in moscow peace talks in nicaragua 
broke down and once again there is talk of renewing us military 
aid to the contra rebels 
although the administration has made no decisions officials 
seem to be laying the groundwork for a new aid request now that the 
negotiations between the sovietbacked sandinistas and the contras 
have collapsed at least for the time being 
the experience at the summit suggests washington and moscow are 
able to move ahead on such issues as arms control human rights and 
bilateral issues but mutual suspicions continue to run high in the 
socalled low intensity conflicts in the third world such 
conflicts continue in central america southern africa the middle 
east the persian gulf and southeast asia 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams acknowledged in an 
interview friday that whatever progress reagan and gorbachev have 
made on other issues during their summit meetings us concerns 
about kremlin policy in nicaragua remain unchanged 
the soviet union has not shown any restraint in shipment of 
arms to sandinistas abrams said estimates of soviet military 
deliveries to the nicaraguan government range between 250 million 
and 500 million since five central american presidents signed a 
regional peace plan 10 months ago he said 
abrams rejected out of hand a soviet proposal to end military 
deliveries to the sandinistas provided the united states terminates 
such shipments to el salvador guatemala and honduras 
he said this would make moscow and washington coequal in an area 
of vital interest to the united states and of no historic interest 
to the kremlin 
if the united states ceases aiding its allies in central 
america how are they to resist cuban subversion he asked 
the kremlin view is that the united states by aiding the 
nicaraguan rebels starting just months after reagan took office in 
1981 bears the major responsibility for the death and destruction 
in nicaragua since then 
abrams had had little to say on nicaragua after congress 
rejected on feb 3 reagans last request for military aid for the 
contras but after the peace talks broke down last thursday he 
sounded like his old combative self again accusing the sandinistas 
of engaging in bad faith 
its important to be clear on what happened abrams said 
the rebels wanted the sandinistas to turn vague promises of 
democracy for nicaragua into a firm timetable but the only firm 
timetable the sandinistas wanted to discuss was the one in which 
the rebels would be required to turn in their arms as part of a 
final settlement he said 
when the time came for the sandinistas to make serious 
commitments it was over he said 
that view was not shared by nicaraguan defense minister humberto 
ortega head of the sandinista delegation who said thursday the 
contras held irrational positions and maintained an 
antinegotiation attitude against the peace 
as for the prospect for a new contra aid request the 
administration is expected to discuss that issue this coming week 
on capitol hill the main protagonists on past contra aid votes 
already are staking out positions along familiar lines 
i encourage the white house to move now and send up an aid 
package for a vote before the july recess said rep jack kemp 
rny 
said rep david bonior rmich this is no time to be talking 
of military aid

for a month the telephones in the office of 
rep william j hughes dnj have been tied up by members of an 
antipornography group who have been urged to phone him and keep 
calling till you get through 
constituents have been unable to reach hughes the house 
speakers staff has had to send a page to contact him and even an 
exasperated hughes has been kept from reaching his secretary when 
hes away from the office 
about 10000 calls and nearly 20000 letters have arrived in a 
campaign orchestrated by the american family association of 
tupelo miss which told its members that an antipornography bill 
would die in a subcommittee chaired by hughes 
perhaps you believe that a congressional office looks like 
home shopping network with dozens of operators sitting before 
computer terminals ready and able to take messages the 
congressman wrote the rev donald e wildmon the groups executive 
director on may 23 complaining about the tactic and calling it 
needless 
hughes chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
said the bill is very much alive and will have a second hearing on 
thursday any delays have been caused by the diversion of staffers 
from the bill to work on the letters and phone calls he said 
callers to hughes office are now greeted by a recorded message 
from the seventerm congressman that is on two answering machines 
the machines were paid for by members of hughes staff who decided 
the crisis could not wait for house officials to buy the devices 
after advising callers on other matters to dial another number 
hughes tells those interested in the pornography bill 
you can be certain that i and the other 200 sponsors of this 
important measure will do all we can to see that it becomes law in 
a timely fashion 
thank you for calling theres no need to leave a message 
your call is being counted automatically 
hughes said in the interview and in letters to house colleagues 
and wildmon that the family association fed its members inaccurate 
information including an allegation that pornographers are 
twisting arms of lawmakers to kill the bill 
but the most inaccurate message hughes said is that the child 
protection and obscenity enforcement act of 1988 is dying in the 
house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
were in the hearing process hughes said wildmon 
demanded we abandon that process and pass the bill with no 
amendments 
hughes said that some provisions in the bill raise sensitive 
first amendment concerns 
noting the 11yearold associations letter asks for donations 
hughes said the money appeal may be the real message the group 
wants to convey 
the legislation encompasses a number of recommendations from the 
reagan administrations commission on pornography 
some of its provisions would allow government seizure of money 
and property derived from violation of pornography and obscenity 
laws use of wiretaps in obscenity investigations prohibition of 
obscenity in cable television programming and creation of a new 
crime of receiving or possessing obscenity with the intent to 
transfer 
wildmon told his followers in early may that the legislation 
is about to die in hughes committee and urged supporters 
if his phone is busy keep calling till you get through 
the letter said pornographers are spending a lot of money 
twisting a lot of arms and pressuring a lot of congressmen and 
asked if you can help defray these unexpected costs id be 
grateful you can use the enclosed envelope 
wildmon said in an interview that he regrets the inconvenience 
suffered by hughes staff but contended he only wrote the letter 
after the crime subcommittee staff refused to tell him about plans 
for the bill 
hughes replied that he doubted that allegation since the staff 
fields such routine inquiries all the time 
asked what evidence he had that the bill would die in committee 
wildmon said i was told by a number of people who knew what they 
were talking about asked who they were he replied no 
comment he also declined to say how he knew pornographers were 
pressuring lawmakers 
wildmon denied that the purpose of his letter was to raise 
money commenting it cost me 79000 to send the letter to 
date we raised 42000 if im going to raise funds by losing 
37000 im going to be out of business in a hurry 
it was a twopage letter and there were three sentences of an 
apology saying ive got expenses to meet 
wildmon said the group had 330000 supporters a number based on 
the 170000 ministers and 160000 others who receive the groups 
publications the american family association wildmon said is a 
group that promotes things that would enhance the family and 
has taken positions against pornography abortion and some 
broadcast entertainment shows

president andrei a gromyko said in remarks 
published sunday that the government will not stand in the way of 
the expansion of the roman catholic church in the soviet union 
of course we arent making any attempts to encroach on the 
rights of the catholic church gromyko was quoted as saying in 
the communist party newspaper pravda and likewise we are not 
trying to encroach on the rights of catholics living in the soviet 
union 
gromyko make the comments saturday during the celebration of 
christianitys arrival 1000 years ago in what is now the soviet 
union the communist soviet government is officially atheist 
gromykos comments followed a question by cardinal johannes 
willebrands on the possibility of organizing catholic churches not 
only in the soviet unions baltic republics where a recognized 
church exists in lithuania but also in other parts of the soviet 
union where there are large catholic communities 
willebrands who heads the vaticans secretariat for christian 
unity is a member of the largest vatican delegation ever to visit 
the soviet union he was among several foreign dignitaries in 
moscow for the church millennium who were invited to a kremlin 
meeting with gromyko 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said large catholic 
communities exist in the ukraine byelorussia and kazakhstan those 
republics have no fully recognized catholic churches and the 
vatican wants the right to appoint bishops there navarro said 
pravdas report of willebrands question taken from a tass 
dispatch omitted the cardinals specific references to the 
ukraine byelorussia and kazakhstan reflecting the kremlins 
sensitivity on the issue 
gromyko said catholic churches could be opened outside the 
baltic states if local authorities agree 
in the future we will give the necessary attention to the 
wishes of soviet catholics regardless of where they live the 
78yearold president was quoted as saying 
willebrands met friday with clergy of the underground ukrainian 
catholic church which josef v stalin ordered absorbed into the 
russian orthodox church in 1946 
ukrainian clerics say there are 3 million to 4 million ukrainian 
catholics in the soviet union pope john paul ii said in a letter 
in april to ukrainian catholics that their church should be fully 
recognized 
the statesupported russian orthodox church bitterly opposes 
recognition of the ukrainian catholic church claiming it was 
formed only as a result of a forced split in the orthodox church at 
the end of the 16th century 
the issue was discussed june 79 at an unofficial seminar on 
religious problems in the soviet union over the weekend religious 
activists released a resolution they adopted at the meeting that 
called for the russian orthodox church to legalize the ukrainian 
church and other underground churches 
the leader of the vatican delegation in moscow cardinal 
agostino casaroli met sunday with konstantin kharchev head of the 
governments council for religious affairs navarro said they 
discussed different questions regarding the relations between the 
catholic church and soviet government but he would not give

masses the radicals screamed as they broke up sidewalk paving 
stones to hurl at police 
the violence began when 10000 students and sympathizers marched 
through the city with the coffin of park raechun who died june 6 
after setting himself on fire it was the third protest suicide by 
radical students since may 15 
marchers armed with firebombs rocks and clubs tried to attack 
the headquarters of the governing democratic justice party during 
the march but were blocked by riot police in combat fatigues and 
black helmets 
protesters set fire to a police truck with firebombs and damaged 
the information office of the japanese embassy with rocks a number 
of police and students were hurt and some protesters were arrested 
but no figures were available 
police reported the first death from the unrest a riot trooper 
died sunday after being injured in fighting the day before in the 
central city of taejon 
the wave of student protests is the nations worst political 
violence since antigovernment riots in june 1987 
but unlike last summer where prodemocracy demonstrators 
enjoyed wide support from the masses the radical students 
demonstrating now represent a small minority most south koreans do 
not support their demands for reunification of communist north 
korea with the prowestern south and the withdrawal from the south 
of 42000 us troops 
marchers shouted yankee go home on sunday but the protest 
was less antiamerican than other recent demonstrations marchers 
yelled slogans as they passed the us information service 
building but there were no incidents beyond one man hurling a 
softdrink can 
students wore red headbands with antigovernment slogans and 
beat drums and gongs as they marched through the city the coffin 
covered in yellow flowers was carried by bearers in traditional 
white mourning clothes 
the dead student belonged to a faction seeking creation of a 
revolutionary government 
marchers began arming themselves with firebombs from a truck 
loaded with the weapons as the procession continued after a rally 
in front of city hall students wielding clubs rocks and firebombs 
went to democratic justice party headquarters where riot police 
blocked the street 
they attacked police who fired volleys of tear gas armored 
vans with multiple tear gas launchers blasted protesters hundreds 
of riot police waiting in sidestreets poured out and quickly routed 
the attackers 
students at one point seized a highway overpass but special 
police martial arts squads hurling tear gas grenades attacked and 
dispersed them 
the protest was aimed mainly at the government of president roh 
taewoo radical leaders denounced the government as a dictatorship 
and called for creation of a peoples republic 
we are here to fight for liberation of the masses said one 
leader 
the radical students have rejected democratic reforms made by 
the roh government in recent months insisting the government is a 
front for dictatorial military rule 
they say the presence of the american troops stationed here 
under a mutual defense pact encourages military rule 
some people watching the march expressed bewilderment and anger 
an elderly man who yelled that students were not patriots 
tried to attack marchers 
why do these young people do this what does it say about our 
country one middleaged man said

chairman oleg savin as saying 
in its dispatch friday tass did not say whether the passengers 
who set up the heaters aboard the 4870ton priamurye were among

when i become president there are no more 
impossible dreams 
it was a refrain jesse jackson repeated often in his travels 
across the nation he often seemed to marvel at how the 
illegitimate son of a poor black teenager had ended up the 
political toast of adoring crowds from beverly hills to west 
memphis ark protected by a pack of secret service agents and 
trailed by a busload of cameras and reporters 
even if he didnt become president jackson said his 
presidential campaign showed how far blacks had come since the days 
when they were relegated to the back of the bus 
nobody really knew how jackson would be received in his second 
democratic presidential bid and he angrily objected to the but 
he cant win tag that often followed his name in news reports 
when the curtain fell on the primary season last tuesday he had 
collected nearly 7 million votes some 29 percent of the total 
that was more than double his 1984 total and a second place 
finish out of an original field of seven democrats 
he won the vote in alabama alaska delaware georgia virginia 
district of columbia louisiana michigan mississippi south 
carolina puerto rico and the virgin islands 
some states where he won more than 20 percent of the vote had 
black populations of less than 1 percent thus accomplishing one of 
jacksons key goals this year adding white votes to his core 
constituency of blacks 
jackson delights in belittling the skeptics and pundits who 
speculated he couldnt do that 
on the campaign trail he often told the story of a white 
supporter who came up to him in beaumont texas the man recalled 
he had seen jackson 20 years earlier at a civil rights 
demonstration he was on the other side wearing the robes of the 
ku klux klan 
the man said he was voting for jackson in 1988 
there were other such dramatic stories along the campaign trail 
as jackson crisscrossed the country courting blue collar workers 
farmers women gays hispanics and other minority groups with his 
message of economic common ground 
today jackson claims the legacy of his campaign is in the 
creation of a coalition forged against ancient barriers of 
race religion sex he says he will make it a permanent political 
force beyond the election 
officially he launched his 1988 campaign last october in 
reality he had never really stopped campaigning after 1984 
continuing to travel the country dazzling audiences with his 
oratorical skills 
his campaign kickoff in a rural iowa hamlet was part of his 
concerted 1988 effort to attract hard pressed farmers along with 
others who had suffered in the reagan years 
the other centerpiece of his campaign was a promise to put a 
stop to drugs and guns in the streets of america 
the drug issue quickly became one of the most consistent crowd 
pleasers in jacksons stump speech soon others in the race were 
also hitting the drug theme 
jacksons speeches were often as motivational as political in 
orientation 
i want something government cant give you he told a rally 
last week i want you to feel better about yourself lift your 
spirits 
just because it rains you dont have to drown was a vintage 
jackson line 
jacksons trademark was crowds numbering in the thousands 
his penchant for wading into the throng to shake hands and pick 
up babies contributed to another trademark a schedule that 
invariably ran hours behind schedule 
it was a nontraditional candidacy that of a black baptist 
minister who had never held any governmental post his views were 
on the far left of his party in a year when democrats were moving 
toward centrist positions 
but jackson made it a point from the beginning to stake out a 
more conciliatory posture than his rebel stance of 1984 when he 
alienated many democrats by attacks on his own party 
he brought in advisers with longtime party credentials and in 
contrast to 1984 spent time meeting with congressional and state 
level democratic leaders 
he made friends like the popular texas agriculture commissioner 
jim hightower he found some enemies like the outspoken mayor of 
new york city ed koch who made himself the voice of the 
antijackson jewish vote 
in the numerous debates held by the seven democratic contenders 
jackson invariably seized the chance to lend levity to the events 
the others scrapped among themselves generally leaving him out 
of the fray that gave jackson the chance to appear the peacemaker 
bringing the focus back to attacking republicans 
i think jesse jackson has been good for the party said bert 
lance the georgia businessman who was in president carters inner 
circle and became an adviser to jackson 
other democrats began to look on jackson as more than a fringe 
candidate when he swept several states in the 20state super 
tuesday primaries on march 8 
after his respectable showings in other states that set the 
stage for his michigan upset on march 26 
but after the contest narrowed to just jackson and michael 
dukakis he could no longer benefit from being the most famous 
person in a pack of lesser knowns who were splitting the rest of 
the vote 
and some ghosts from 1984 refused to go away most notably the 
antipathy toward him by jewish voters who were offended that he had 
called new york hymietown and by his past association with 
nation of islam leader louis farrakhan and his propalestinian 
positions 
as the delegate margin slipped away from him jackson 
increasingly sent a message that went beyond just the presidential 
campaign 
i will never surrender dont you surrender he told his 
audiences 
although the words came in the context of the presidential 
campaign jackson clearly meant someting broader 
what have i built a coalition to change the course of our 
nation for the better he said ive pushed back walls ive 
lifted ceilings

the biblical fragrance of frankincense is on 
the market again as oman revives an ancient perfume industry that 
flourished 3000 years ago 
the oman perfumery is opening new markets in the united states 
and europe for amouage arabic for waves a perfume based on 
frankincense and myrrh 
at about 375 an ounce amouage may be the worlds most 
expensive perfume 
frankincense the gum from a desert shrub called boswellia 
carterii was prized in ancient times as a drug a medicine and an 
aromatic 
legend had it that frankincense trees were guarded by winged 
serpents and that only an elite tribe could tap the bark for the 
precious resin 
myrrh the resin of a plant that looks like a small cactus 
without the prickles was once harvested in dhofar province where 
legend has it the three kings gathered before following the star 
of bethlehem to pay homage to jesus 
amouage was developed in 1984 by the governmentsupported 
perfumery also known as the house of amouage and has been one of 
omans major successes in its effort to diversify the countrys 
oilbased economy following the slump in oil prices 
amouage is the rollsroyce of perfumes khalifa almukheini 
house of amouages marketing executive told the associated press 
it was created for people who dont have to ask the price 
it took four years for master perfumer guy robert a frenchman 
to develop the fragrance he came up with three varieties that were 
tested on men and women in the west and around the middle east 
a winning bouquet emerged and the formula is a closely guarded 
secret 
what is known is that amouage contains more than 100 natural 
ingredients including dhofari frankincense and myrrh omani lime 
and omani rose found on the 6000foothigh slopes of green 
mountain 
added to these are exotic items including the honeyscented 
tuberose jasmine blue chamomile orris vanilla patchouli 
sandalwood geranium and musk 
the fragrance for men is decidedly musky the womens is more 
floral 
amouage has 50 major outlets in new york london paris geneva 
and the persian gulf and despite its price it appears to have a 
growing clientele 
it is sold in sterling silver flasks with 24carat gold inlays 
but it also is sold in cellophane sachets at airport shops 
the perfumery on the outskirts of muscat omans capital 
declined to disclose dollar figures but said sales last year rose 
by 16 percent over 1986 
officials anticipate another rise this year with a new marketing 
drive into other parts of the united states including beverly 
hills 
well soon be marketing a new brand of the exotic arabian 
perfume to be sold in frenchmade crystal and at about 35 percent 
the price of the amouage in the silver flasks almukheini said 
the government of oman a sultanate the size of kansas on the 
southeastern tip of the arabian peninsula is giving guidance on 
harvesting to frankincense growers and helping them find markets 
there are no statistics on current frankincense production but 
there are an estimated 400000 to 500000 frankincense trees in 
dhofar 
three thousand years ago the most sought after frankincense in 
the world came from dhofar on the edge of the desolate empty 
quarter 
it was carried by camel train over the great caravan routes 
across the hadramut desert to babylon egypt greece and rome or 
shipped in dhows to india and the orient 
about 3000 tons are said to have been shipped annually during 
the time of christ 
the greek philospher herodotus wrote that 2 tons of 
frankincense were burned every year in the temple of baal in 
babylon now part of modern iraq 
a vertical incision is made in the bark of the tree which can 
range from 6 to 24 feet in height the gum oozes from the tree and 
hardens into translucent pearlshaped drops

southern baptists squared off sunday 
for another battle over control of the nations largest protestant 
denomination now firmly in the hands of the fundamentalist wing 
as thousands of messengers gathered here for their annual 
convention some observers said the moderate camp might make a 
comeback after nine years of defeat 
it looks as if moderates could win in san antonio wrote 
daniel m allen editor of the sbc cause urging the other side 
to bring in voters to avert such an outcome 
convention business begins tuesday after a day of preliminary 
meetings and preaching up to 40000 people are expected to attend 
as representatives of the churchs 147 million members 
the conflict in the southern baptist convention as the 
denomination is known has intensified over the last year as 
increased fundamentalist power drove various leaders out of office 
and imposed tighter rules of belief 
the struggle fought largely over the issue of whether the bible 
is the literal truth has stirred up bitter feelings and sharp 
words 
clever men have stripped us of our rights said john f 
baugh a houston businessman and layman of the moderate camp 
fundamentalism he said brings out an insatiable appetite for 
power and demand for conformity 
its time to stop this nonsense of barbarian attacks on that 
which we hold dear 
a profundamentalist former convention president the rev james 
t draper jr of euless texas said after a recent clash with a 
moderate leader it seems to be a situation of who can outmuscle 
the other they have given us no alternative 
a man in the middle the rev charles fuller of roanoke va 
who for three years has headed a peace committee trying to calm the 
turmoil said the denomination is in a crisis of spirit 
the peace plan he said has been repeatedly violated and there 
has been an acceleration of political activity by both sides 
with partisan strategy meetings held in numerous states 
at the center of the conflict is the denominations powerful 
presidency which has the authority to appoint trustees who control 
southern baptist agencies and institutions 
most of those boards now have fundamentalist majorities as a 
result of the wings nine years of presidential victories 
the crucial decision at this weeks meeting is election of a new 
president the two camps have rallied behind the expected opposing 
nominees and campaigns for them have rolled across the country 
backed by the fundamentalist wing is the rev jerry vines 
copastor of the 18000member first baptist church of 
jacksonville fla 
the expected moderate nominee is the rev richard jackson of 
phoenix ariz pastor of the north phoenix baptist church also 
with 18000 members 
both are fundamentalists in their views of the bible whose 
interpretation has been at the crux of the struggle but jackson 
doesnt favor imposing his view on institutional trustees while 
vines does 
i would not appoint anyone to any committee vines said 
who did not endorse prescriptions laid down by the peace 
committee 
it insists the bible is without error and on belief in its text 
as literal truth that adam and eve were real people that the 
biblical miracles actually occurred and that the bible accurately 
records history 
jackson said i dont believe there ought to be a control 
group and that if he wins election it would mean a change to 
allow baptists to be free again 
the winner will succeed the rev adrian rogers of memphis 
tenn a fundamentalist standardbearer who has held the post a 
customary two years his previous election in 1979 inaugurated the 
fundamentalist tide

munchkins 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
stephen cox is off to see the munchkins the 
wonderful munchkins of oz but he has no yellow brick road to 
follow in his search for the little people who greeted dorothy in 
the 1939 film the wizard of oz 
it may not be easy to find some of them said the writer 
i know there are some still living but theyve sort of fallen 
into the woodwork 
cox is writing a book about the little people who sang and 
danced with the young judy garland in the musical based on l frank 
baums magical tale of good and bad witches a bumbling wizard and 
dorothys lovable friends the scarecrow tin man and cowardly lion 
coxs book oz remembered memoirs of the munchkins will be 
published by ep dutton of new york and released next year to 
coincide with the 50th anniversary of the mgm movie classic 
there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are 
fascinated by the munchkins said jeanne martinet a dutton 
editor 
so far cox has located about 30 of the 124 people who played 
munchkinland villagers and soldiers he has spent days poring over 
telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but 
old address books and faded signin sheets from longago lunches on 
the movies set 
i figure its about time to give them some credit cox said 
adding that the movie credits gave them little mention all it 
said was the singer midgets as the munchkins their scene lasts 
about 10 minutes but i think its the most enchanting part of the 
whole movie 
for margaret pellegrini being a munchkin meant a chance to meet 
movie stars and other people of her size 
she was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now she 
said recently from her home in glendale ariz meeting up with 
all the little people because i hadnt been around very many 
little people it was just a great experience 
i didnt think it would be so popular of course i was 
excited about it and i was thinking oh boy im going to 
hollywood 
a lot of the munchkins think a book on the munchkins is that 
really going to sell cox said they dont realize how popular 
they are 
most of the men and women who played the munchkins were 
recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by leo singer 
and major doyle but many of them had never acted before and some 
were from europe and didnt speak english cox said 
a few of them went on in show business but most eventually 
settled into other jobs he said 
mickey carroll of st louis now 69 continued acting for a 
time then returned home to the family business selling grave 
monuments parnell st aubin opened a tavern in chicago called the 
midgets club and walked along the bar serving drinks meinhardt 
raabe went on to portray little oscar for oscar mayer lunchmeats 
and made promotional appearances around the country 
theyre all proud of their parts in the wizard of oz cox 
said theyre proud of being a part of one of the best motion 
pictures ever made a new generation discovers the wizard of oz 
every year 
but for all the fond memories of working with miss garland and 
the other stars there were problems cox said 
pellegrini recalled heavy elaborate costumes and layers of 
makeup lewis croft of idaho falls idaho remembered how it 
smarted when the plastic skin that made the men look bald was 
ripped off like a piece of tape at the end of each day 
cox said he has heard a story about one munchkin an actor 
nicknamed the count and wellknown for his drinking who 
visited the bathroom one day and wound up falling into the toilet 
and being stuck there for 45 minutes 
some of the little people are telling tall tales he said 
but some of its good for legends

amid the cheers that greeted george bushs speech 
to a republican gathering were sighs of relief from party activists 
pleased that he finally took the offensive against democrat michael 
dukakis 
while the high command of the bush presidential election 
campaign pushed at the weekend conference for grassroots work from 
gop regulars party people from 16 states voiced new hope about the 
vice presidents prospects 
bush himself set last thursday as an important turning point in 
his campaign using a speech in his adopted hometown of houston to 
lash out at the dukakis record and the massachusetts governors 
out of the mainstream beliefs 
top bush campaign aides said it always had been the plan that 
bush would turn his rhetorical guns on dukakis but only at the 
end of the primary and caucus season when the identity of his fall 
opponent was unmistakable 
bush said he thought dukakis had pretty well shot his specific 
bolts at him and said were just beginning 
this proved heartening to republicans who traveled to denver for 
the first of three unity conferences scheduled by the republican 
national committee two more will be held in cincinnati and atlanta 
i wanted to see bush become his own man as soon as possible 
because youve got to grab the initiative said bill hughes a 
bush campaign chairman from vancouver wash i was afraid that 
bush would wait until after the august convention to go and speak 
out 
hughes and other republicans interviewed over the weekend agreed 
that bush still must overcome the obstacle of campaigning for 
president while holding the office of vice president and they said 
he must be careful of moving too far away from president reagan 
because that could alienate people in his own party 
i think it was critically important for him to start talking 
about the facts about michael dukakis said barbara campbell 
state gop chairman in montana this was something i was really 
pleased to see 
several gop figures said that bushs early clinching of the 
republican party nomination the lateapril pennsylvania primary 
put him over the top had the effect of forcing the vice president 
to the sidelines they also said this caused bush too often to be 
on the defensive to find himself questioned more on the reagan 
administration record than on his own plan for the nations future 
our contest didnt last as long we ended watching the michael 
dukakisjesse jackson show from the sidelines said new mexicos 
gov garrey carruthers i think thats cost him 
carruthers said bush would have to work especially hard in 
western states where there was an absence of any genuine gop 
nomination competition late in the primary season 
punch green bushs state campaign chairman in oregon said the 
vice presidents wideranging attacks on dukakis positions and his 
record as governor will help make the contrast come out 
not only that he said bush seems far more comfortable making 
speeches in which he couples explanations of his own positions with 
criticisms of those held by dukakis 
i was just elated with bushs speeches in houston thursday 
and in denver friday green said for the first time in a long 
time i heard a real campaign speech from my candidate 
bush and his top campaign aides seemed buoyed by the 
tubthumping speeches of support given at this unity conference by 
former gop white house rivals bob dole jack kemp and alexander m 
haig jr 
but the vice presidents aides and the men who likely will be 
bush campaign surrogates also said the republican ticket must work 
hard to retain some of the democratic and independent support that 
reagan enjoyed in 1980 and 1984 
richard pinsky who worked on pat robertsons campaign said 
that tens of thousands of democrats crossed over to the gop to 
support robertson 
pinsky said the party must work hard to keep these 
issuedriven voters in the republican fold 
kemp rny said the bush campaign must not write off any 
region of the country or any group 
and bush pointedly reached out for hispanic support saying he 
opposed a proposal to make english the official language and saying 
he didnt feel people ought to be threatened by the growing 
hispanicamerican population 
francisco joe barrego of denver executive director of the 
gops state nationalities committee said bush is putting all his 
affirmative actions out front 
i think hes doing the right thing right now said barrego 
whose organization speaks for people from cuba czechoslovakia 
latvia japan chinese and several other countries

leading newspapers sunday carried a stern 
government call for tighter discipline and more ideological 
indoctrination among students following a week of political 
agitation at beijing university 
our college students should uphold the communist party 
leadership uphold socialism the official party newspaper the 
peoples daily admonished in a frontpage article 
beijing university authorities tore down dozens of posters 
students had put up in the past week the posters demanded 
democracy an end to government bureaucracy and corruption and 
better living conditions 
putting up anonymous posters is against university rules 
the unrest was triggered by the slaying june 2 of chai qingfeng 
a 22yearold physics student who died in an offcampus brawl 
university officials allowed students to set up a small shrine 
to chai in a room used for staff meetings dozens of paper flower 
wreaths lined the small space but the messages were nonpolitical 
expressing sorrow over chais death 
students said they were not sure when they would be allowed to 
hold a memorial service for chai 
the killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poor 
living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects after 
graduation for the nations lowpaid intellectuals 
thousands of students last week protested chais death by taking 
to the streets and calling for a prodemocracy march to central 
beijings tiananmen square police sealed off the square to keep 
protesters away 
the students said chai was beaten to death by hooligans when 
he was buying liquor at a store and they put up posters angrily 
demanding speedy punishment of the unemployed local youths who had 
allegedly killed him 
the demonstration was the largest since massive prodemocracy 
rallies in december 1986 and january 1987 
hundreds of students also gathered on the campus of beijing 
university for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be 
learned from the incident 
the peoples daily said the state education commission met 
friday and ordered that those who have violated school 
regulations should be dealt with quickly and severely but it did 
not say what steps would be taken 
without specifically mentioning the unrest at beijing 
university the commission said that a few students cannot tell 
right from wrong with regard to some political principles and even 
openly spread reactionary views 
the newspaper called for increased ideological education and 
better school administration to maintain order 
any words or actions that impair party leadership discipline 
stability and unity also obstruct the reforms and are against the 
basic interests of the people of the whole country the newspaper 
quoted the education commission as saying 
the commissions message also was carried by the xinhua news 
agency and most national newspapers published the xinhua report 
with the school year almost at an end the extent of any 
discipline may not become clear until a new semester starts in 
september 
at the university campus bulletin boards that until saturday 
were plastered with dozens of posters criticizing the government 
were almost bare with only a few notices for music recitals and 
graduate school exam preparation the few students reading the 
notices said they thought the political unrest was over 
the government made it clear last week that it would not permit 
a repeat of the massive student prodemocracy marches of 198687 
that winter thousands of students in beijing and other major 
cities took to the streets to demand westernstyle political 
reforms to match the countrys economic reforms 
conservatives in the leadership ousted communist party chief hu 
yaobang for failing to halt the student protests quickly enough 
this time authorities moved decisively within 48 hours of 
chais slaying police tried to defuse tensions by arresting six 
suspects

house speaker jim wright denied sunday that he 
had violated house conflictofinterest rules in his financial 
dealings and declared i am extremely confident of being cleared 
im havent done anything dishonest or illegal said the 
texas democrat im convinced i havent violated any rules of the 
house 
wrights comments came during backtoback appearances on 
cbstvs face the nation and abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
they were part of his response to an announcement friday by the 
house ethics committee that it was beginning a preliminary inquiry 
into the allegations wright held a twohour news conference friday 
to deny the allegations and he repeated many of those statements on 
sunday 
wright called the charges a partisan political ploy raised 
by republicans seeking to deflect democratic charges of ethical 
violations by current and former members of the reagan 
administration 
its a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan 
ploy wright said on the cbs program 
the committees inquiry was originally suggested by rep newt 
gingrich rga but the panel said its investigation would range 
beyond the scope proposed by gingrich 
next month wright will preside next month over the democratic 
national convention and he said sunday that he doesnt expect the 
ethics investigation to have any effect on that role 
asked on the cbs show if he would give up that chairmanship 
wright said i dont expect to 
asked if his running the convention would hurt the democrats 
wright answered there is no cloud over my head no sir ive 
done nothing unethical nothing illegal nothing violative of the 
rules of the house 
wright declined to say if he thought the investigation should be 
handled by an independent counsel rather than the ethics committee 
in the democraticcontrolled house 
im not trying to tell the committee how to conduct its 
inquiry wright said 
asked if he wanted the investigation done by the committee or an 
independent counsel wright answered i dont have a preference 
but he continued i want it resolved and i want it resolved as 
quickly as possible and he pledged full cooperation 
wright defended his book reflections of a public man from 
which he received a 55 percent royalty totaling about 55000 
questions have been raised about whether that royalty percentage is 
higher than is normally paid 
there was nothing wrong with the contract wright said 
later adding i think its a good book 
asked about reports that his friends were buying the books as a 
way to give financial support to wright he answered i didnt 
sell these books to friends 
royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity mrs 
wright and me he said 
the ethics committee is investigating whether wright used one of 
his staff members to work on the book at taxpayer expense whether 
the royalty amounts were excessive and whether they were paid in 
return for wright giving some of his campaign business to william 
carlos moore the publisher 
moore served more than four months in federal prison after 
pleading guilty in 1975 to income tax evasion charges wright had 
written a letter to the federal court on moores behalf 
it may have been poor judgment to write the letter said 
wright although he defended his long friendship with moore and 
said im not ashamed of that 
sure ive made mistakes of judgment but i havent done 
anything dishonest or illegal wright said

police clashed sunday with 
demonstrators protesting a constitutional amendment that made islam 
the state religion authorities said 50 people suffered minor 
injuries 
the demonstrations coincided with a oneday strike called to 
protest the new law passed tuesday by parliament and signed into 
law by president hussain muhammad ershad 
police and witnesses said about 20 vehicles most of them 
stateowned buses were damaged by the demonstrators and that two 
bicycle rickshaws were set ablaze they said 30 people were 
arrested 
police said there was no major violence and that groups of 
protesters were small because of heavy rains 
most of the injuries occurred when police with wooden sticks 
charged demonstrators outside dhaka university near dhaka college 
and at a ferry terminal in nearby sadarghat witnesses said 
the strike which was called by 20 major opposition parties to 
protest the legislation closed down most shops and private 
businesses government offices remained open but attendance was 
reported as poor 
the strike disrupted transportation including intercity bus 
service and delayed flights from dhakas airport 
the united news of india news agency said several trains were 
stalled when protesters blocked tracks 
reports from other cities including chittagong in the south and 
sylhet in the north indicated widespread compliance with the 
strike which ended at dusk 
rashed khan menon leader of a fiveparty leftist opposition 
alliance said the adherence to the strike indicated that the 
people have rejected the law making islam the state religion 
the opposition parties claim the new law is illegal because it 
was passed by a parliament dominated by ershad whose party won a 
majority in a 1986 election the opposition contends was rigged the 
20 major opposition parties have no vote in parliament since they 
boycotted elections last march saying that fair polling could not 
be held under ershad a former army general who took power in a 
bloodless 1982 coup 
aiting on a union city street corner for a bus to 
new york city said the presidential campaign has not been 
interesting especially since neither gov thomas h kean nor sen 
bill bradley have taken an active role 
they can still be vice president and that would make this a 
better election she said 
on the famed boardwalk in atlantic city tourists seemed to 
favor dukakis but many stressed that they were settling only 
because they dislike bush 
he seems as if hes been in the background for the past eight 
years and he hasnt done very much said ken stout who was 
taking time out from a communication workers of america union 
convention 
the only other candidate i might have supported has been 
involved in scandals he said i liked gary hart his 
appearance his charisma 
another hart fan was found waiting for a train in newark tim 
morin 21 of sea bright said hart would have made a good 
president i dont care what he does in his private life 
looking realistically at the potential ticket morin said he was 
satisfied with the republican and democratic choices but i like 
dukakis best 
back on the boardwalk stout said the only way bush could win 
is if he comes up with a strong running mate 
nick pomponio a 36yearold computer technician from gloucester 
township said he would like to see jackson as dukakis running 
mate 
i think it would be a big boost for minorities he said 
he jackson seems like he can handle the vice presidential job 
and dukakis seems like he would be a good president 
pedro rivera disagrees the camden resident said he doubts he 
will even vote in the general election in november 
i dont think jesse will be in the running he said 
lillian lazar of philadelphia looked patriotic dressed in red 
white and blue but her sentiments over the likely presidential 
candidates were largely disappointment 
theyre both lousy she said dukakis is too weak hes 
another jimmy carter and bush is a big mouth i dont like his 
tactics and i think he lies i think he knows more about the 
contra situation but he says he doesnt 
two rare bush supporters turned up among the boardwalks morning 
relaxation crowd 
the government now is run by republicans and its good so 
far said john ciarlone of trenton with his wife catherine 
nodding in assent next to him dukakis is not a strong leader

two sandinista army patrols said 
nicaraguan rebels attacked their troops in separate incidents in 
the north and one officer said the insurgents yelled that they had 
orders to break a truce 
a rebel spokesman in miami who identified himself only as 
joaquin said saturday night he had no reports of the attacks or 
that the ceasefire had ended if they attack our positions we 
have to return fire he said 
a fragile truce was declared march 21 the start of facetoface 
talks between the usbacked rebels known as contras and the 
sovietsupported government troops 
but a series of talks the latest ending on thursday made 
little headway in ending the civil war that has killed more than 
26000 people 
the 60day ceasefire was to end may 31 but the two sides 
extended it by tacit agreement each saying it would initiate no 
offensive action against the other but would take defense 
action if necessary 
second lt julio cesar rizo the commander of a group of 
sandinista soldiers said contra rebels ambushed a small unit of 
his troops early saturday in jinotega province about 160 miles 
northeast of the capital managua 
rizo said there were no injuries they just started 
shooting he said 
earlier saturday lt ronald dorado reported heavy fighting 
friday farther north in las colinas 
we sent a message with a farmer to the contras saying we 
wanted to talk said dorado they responded with rifle fire 
dorado said that during the half hour of fighting the contras 
yelled to him that they had orders to break the truce he said 
the government troops suffered no injuries but that one contra died 
and three suffered wounds 
residents heard the gunfire but called it minor compared to 
fighting in the region before the ceasefire 
the truce has given many in battlescarred northern nicaragua a 
chance to resume duties they had abandoned in fear 
it used to be terrible said griselva torres 48 there 
were bombings missiles mortars and shooting all the time 
nearby around the village of la rica several bulletpocked 
homes sat abandoned weeds and vines grew over the shells of houses 
thank god theres a truce mrs torres said 
la rica became a ghost town a few years ago because of heavy 
fighting but nicaraguans have moved back and a hilltop sandinista 
military base now guards the town 
julio cesar lago said he had moved away from la rica but 
returned in april about a month after the ceasefire was signed 
to plant corn before the may rains 
its calm now but it was bad he said 
dario rugama a 40yearold farmer living in nearby quebrada 
grande said the truce has brought peace and freedom of movement to 
the region 
we just want to work and live in peace he said now 
theres sort of peace

two years ago james stimpfle would 
stand on the beach in nome and release balloons to float across the 
bering strait hoping to help thaw a cold war ban on travel between 
alaska and siberia 
people laughed and called him crazy 
but on monday stimpfle will take off on a flight to siberia 
accompanied by 80 politicians eskimos and reporters crossing a 
border that has been closed for 40 years 
there was a lot of skepticism at first stimpfle recalled 
thursday from nome in a telephone interview often interrupted by 
calls from the alaska governors office and others helping to plan 
mondays friendship flight to the siberian city of provideniya 
there were a lot of people who thought it wouldnt happen in 
our lifetime stimpfle said there were a lot of people who 
thought i was eccentric and questioned my loyalty and my 
motivations 
the real estate agent says his motivations are simple two years 
ago at the start of alaskas oil recession business was slow and 
he had time to think up ways of improving his own fortune and that 
of nome a town of 3700 people on alaskas western coast 
stimpfle 40 figured that if someone could pry open the 
alaskasiberia border closed in 1948 because of cold war tensions 
then nome could become an economic center for both sides of the 
bering strait 
he envisioned increased trade joint economic ventures and 
tourist excursions by airplanes and cruise ships between nome and 
siberia 
he also saw opportunities for cultural exhange his wife 
bernadette is a king island eskimo and stimpfle heard stories of 
how eskimos earlier this century took boats to siberia to trade and 
visit relatives 
i heard tales of people wanting to go over there and i 
wondered why they werent doing anything about it stimpfle said 
he set out to do something 
in addition to the balloons he got a huge peace sign in 
russian placed on little diomede island just three miles from the 
soviet island of big diomede in the bering strait 
stimpfle also fired letters off to american and soviet leaders 
ive probably written somewhere between 500 and 700 letters 
probably 5000 to 6000 including copies he said it was the 
shotgun approach i hit them at the very top i hit them in the 
middle and i hit them at the bottom 
gradually siberia fever began to catch on in nome local radio 
station knom started broadcasting a weekly update on siberiaalaska 
events in russian and english later adding a russian word of the 
day 
stimpfle also was aided by good timing soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs policy of openness paved the way for improved 
alaskasiberia relations 
last august the soviets allowed american swimmer lynn cox to 
cross from little diomede to big diomede and siberian medical 
researchers signed a joint research agreement with alaskan 
scientists in november 
the biggest break came last fall when alaska airlines jumped on 
the friendship flight bandwagon hoping to establish a regular 
tourist route he said government officials who brushed off a real 
estate agents letters about flights to siberia began getting 
similar letters from executives of a major corporation 
as long as just one person was doing it it never would have 
reached this level of credibility stimpfle said 
stimpfle would like to see the whole bering sea border opened 
he would like to see more joint ventures in fishing 
telecommunications and trade 
many who once scoffed at his dreams now give him the benefit of 
the doubt 
it was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream 
said lou cancelmi alaska airlines spokesman i personally 
wondered if this day would ever come 
i dont think jim stimpfle ever thought for a moment that it 
wouldnt and thats what it takes to make something like this come 
true

an aids drug can dramatically boost the 
intelligence of youngsters whose brains are damaged by the aids 
virus and even restores their ability to walk and talk researchers 
said sunday 
damage to the brain is one of the earliest and most devastating 
of the effects of the lethal virus in children the research 
suggests that the drug azt can reverse these symptoms and 
apparently bring virusdamaged brain cells back to health 
azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir is the only medicine 
routinely used to suppress the aids virus called hiv in adults 
it can slow the progression of aids but does not cure it 
the latest research directed by dr philip a pizzo of the us 
national cancer institute was presented at the fourth 
international conference on aids 
pizzos findings came unexpectedly during testing of a portable 
pump to administer the drug to children he found that youngsters 
iq scores increased about 15 points and many of the other severe 
brain symptoms of the virus also went away 
everybody who looks at this data has to get excited said 
dr daniel hoth of the us national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases we are all nervous by small numbers of 
patients studied but the data itself is very exciting 
more than 7000 people most of them doctors and scientists 
from 138 countries gathered in stockholm for the opening sunday of 
the fourzozo64xzys there were 25 deaths among patients 
who got azt alone compared with 11 among people who got both drugs 
aids damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

wants

when they are a power game are structures of sin their 
statement said 
they said it would be ethically irritating if the f16s are 
based in calabria as an economic solution to our longstanding 
problems 
earlier in the week seven puglian bishops said puglia is 
already paying a heavy price in servitude to programs of military 
armament and the region could constitute a top priority 
target if the planes are based there

jesse jackson said sunday he is not claiming 
that the democrats should offer him the vice presidency because i 
do not want to push mike dukakis to that point but jackson 
reiterated that he deserves serious consideration for the no 2 job 
jackson runnerup to michael dukakis in the race for the 
partys presidential nomination appeared to back down from recent 
statements in which he said he should be offered the vice 
presidency because of his secondplace finish 
asked if in his comments he was saying he should be offered the 
nomination and then would decide whether to accept it jackson 
said no im not saying that because i do not want to push mike 
dukakis to that point its not necessary 
jackson interviewed from chicago on nbctvs meet the 
press said he has not made a decision on whether he would accept 
the vice presidency but he added i believe ive earned serious 
consideration 
i brought to this campaign a broadened base a moral tone and 
my constituency represents the growth of the democratic party 
represents the future of the democratic party he said we won 
nearly 7 million votes from every sector of the population weve 
earned serious consideration at every level of our party that 
includes the ticket 
confusion over jacksons position increased this past week when 
a cable news network report on thursday quoted jackson as saying he 
wants to be vice president 
jackson asked to clarify the issue said friday lets leave 
it at consideration but on saturday jackson said his experience 
in foreign policy would strengthen a ticket with dukakis 
dukakis says he wants a vice president with foreign policy 
experience well jackson said pausing to an ovation from a 
chicago crowd of about 1200 
jackson also said he was not interested in a cabinet post 
saying an appointment position is also a disappointment 
position a vice presidential position is a constitutional position 
from which you cannot be fired because youre elected by the 
people 
asked sunday what was more important making history as the 
first black on a party ticket or helping the democrats regain the 
white house jackson said he was dedicated to a democratic victory 
certainly my commitment is a to make america better and 
ive tried to do it every day and every way at great risk it is to 
see my party win he said 
but jackson added that he doesnt believe recent polls that show 
a dukakisjackson ticket losing in november 
jackson later flew to detroit where he attended the third game 
of the national basketball association championship between the 
detroit pistons and the los angeles lakers 
in the television interview jackson backed efforts by his 
supporters meeting in michigan with other democrats on the party 
platform to include a call for raising taxes on the rich in the 
proposed plank 
we ought to be candid with the american people jackson 
said theres no miraculous way of getting out of this budget 
deficit we certainly cannot come out just by collecting the 
uncollected taxes of reaganomics we must collect some exempted 
taxes of reaganomics 
jackson said president reagan has given the republicans a 
party now they must pay for the party 
the democratic candidate also agreed with secretary of state 
george p shultz who criticized dukakis for suggesting that the 
united states move its embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem 
secretary shultz is correct and every american president has 
taken that position jackson said moving that embassy to 
jerusalem would not make israel more secure and thats our concern 
there it would not be security for israel not justice for 
palestinians not peace for both

members of the yankton sioux tribe and 
their supporters will begin a monthlong walk monday to press their 
claim for the return of a quarry that yields the red stone used to 
make sacred sioux pipes 
the yankton sioux believe the site outside pipestone minn 
that is now the pipestone national monument was illegally taken 
from them by the federal government more than 60 years ago tribal 
chairman stephen cournoyer jr said 
tribal members also want to stop the use of the soft red 
pipestone to make socalled peace pipes and other items for sale to 
tourists he said 
the sacredness of that pipe is no longer there when people are 
using it for their gain it wasnt intended to be exploited like 
that cournoyer said when everyodys got pipes and they dont 
know what they were intended for thats kind of sacrilegious 
the meandering walk will start at green grass on the cheyenne 
river sioux reservation in the central part of the state green 
grass is the home of arvol looking horse keeper of the original 
sacred pipe of the sioux tribes 
organizers said they expect about 100 people will start the 
peaceful march but the group should grow before the walkers reach 
the quarry in southwestern minnesota on july 15 
looking horse said he became involved in the walk because hes 
worried about the use of pipestone to make inappropriate items the 
pipe was given to the sioux by the great spirit and smoking it is a 
central part of their beliefs said looking horse who said hes 
the 19thgeneration keeper of the pipe 
thats the blood of our people the red pipestone looking 
horse said now theres a lot of misuse and abuse of the pipe at 
pipestone 
looking horse said people from as far away as california and new 
york have called to say they plan to join in the walk because 
theres a lot of people coming back to the old ways like the young 
people i feel theres going to be a lot of people on the walk 
he said 
before europeans arrived pipes and other items made from the 
stone were traded to many other tribes 
the yankton sioux tribal council has passed a resolution asking 
the federal government and the pipestone indian shrine association 
a nonprofit organization that helps market items carved from the 
stone to give up the monument 
the resolution says 1858 and 1892 treaties with the federal 
government guaranteed the yankton siouxs ownership and use of the 
quarry the site was sold to the government in the late 1920s but 
the yankton sioux claim the sale was invalid because it was 
negotiated by tribal members handpicked by federal officials 
vince halvorson superintendent of pipestone national monument 
said the yankton sioux were paid for the quarry area which 
includes a small stream scenic low cliffs a museum and a 
protected area of prairie vegetation and the monument was 
established by congress in 1937 
the issue as we see it was settled in 1928 or 1929 when they 
received payment halvorson said 
however halvorson said he believes the yankton sioux have the 
right to attempt to regain the quarry under the indian religious 
freedom act 
the pipestone also known as catlinite for artistexplorer 
george catlin is quarried only by indians who get permits and use 
hand tools 
federal officials have no control over what items are made and 
sold outside the monument but only items that represent indian 
culture are sold at the monument halvorson said 
up to 90 people depend on the quarry to make a living he said 
however looking horse said its not proper for the sacred stone 
to be used for a commercial purpose 
because this is sacred to us we are doing all we can to 
protect it looking horse said the only thing i want is to 
stop the misuse of that pipestone

the mighty mississippi could hit record 
low levels this summer because of the drought plaguing the midwest 
and northern plains and already has fallen enough in places to 
ground barges officials say 
the river stood at just 8 feet on the vicksburg gauge on may 28 
the secondlowest reading on record for that date by friday it 
had fallen to 38 feet and it was expected to fall to 3 feet by 
monday and continue dropping 
mondays predicted reading would be the record low for this time 
of year about 30 feet below normal the lowest reading at 
vicksburg for any date was in the early 1930s when the river 
dropped to minus 67 feet below the level considered as the zero 
point 
at memphis tenn the river could sink below the 7yearold 
record of minus 73 feet by july 13 according to a 28day forecast 
released by the lower mississippi river forecast center in slidell 
la 
the river is still very deep and dangerous but this is a 
record low said michael logue spokesman for the us army corps 
of engineers vicksburg district 
in some areas the river remains deeper than 100 feet logue 
said but many points along the boat traffic channel have fallen 
below the minimum 9foot depth needed for normal navigation 
that means big problems for towboat operators who must lighten 
cargoes and run the risk of equipment damage if they run aground 
robin radlein of the national weather service river forecasting 
center in slidell la said it would take heavy rainfall over a 
large part of the central united states to raise the river 
appreciably and thats not likely this time of year 
the types of stages were reporting now are similar to what 
youd normally get in late september after a hot dry summer 
she said and weve still got that ahead of us 
normally this would be the high water season logue said but 
the vicksburg district expects to have to dredge soon near 
greenville to keep the channel open 
it looks like its going to be a major challenge this year to 
maintain our navigation project logue said im sure the 
economic impact is in the millions of dollars already from people 
having to carry shallow loads it has an impact on the whole 
central part of the country 
steve golding owner of ole man river towing co in vicksburg 
said the drought has cut into his profits 
ole man river is loading barges for a draft of 86 feet rather 
than the normal 96 feet and that last foot sometimes is your 
only profit margin golding said current cargoes generally are 
about 10 to 15 percent lighter he said 
the cost of pushing the load is the same or higher because 
trips take longer golding said maintenance costs are higher 
because of problems with running aground he said 
golding said the navigable channel is so narrow in places that 
northbound tows must wait downstream for southbound towboats to 
pass 
last weekend 55 barges ran aground at memphis closing that 
stretch of the river for two days while the tows were disassembled 
and moved 
friday the river was reopened from cairo ill to st louis 
for the first time in two days after numerous tows ran aground the 
red river a louisiana tributary of the mississippi is closed 
indefinitely with some boats stranded upstream 
it makes for an unpredictable trip golding said and it 
puts a lot of stress on the pilots last week we ran aground with 
one barge and knocked a hole in the bottom we also knocked a 
rudder off one of our boats

irans interior minister on sunday denied 
a western news report that ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is dying of 
cancer and said the leader is healthy 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
quoted ali akbar mohtashemi as saying that he met khomeini several 
days ago and that he is now in perfect shape 
western analysts believe that a power struggle with tehrans 
fractious hierarchy will intensify as various factions seek to 
seize control of the islamic revolution after the 87yearold 
khomeini dies 
mohtashemi said in an interview in sundays edition of the 
englishlanguage tehran times daily that the foreign media has been 
claiming for years that khomeinis health was failing 
he charged that the latest report in the united states by the 
cbs television network was a zionist scheme to cheer up iraqi 
president saddam hussein and his demoralized army 
iran has been at war with iraq since september 1980 
cbs said on thursday that intelligence reports indicated that 
khomeini may now be very close to death it quoted the reports 
as saying the ayatollahs cancer has spread from his prostate to 
his liver and that he may only have two or three months to 
live 
mohtashemi a hardliner linked with shiite moslem extremists 
holding foreign hostages in lebanon said the report could be seen 
as an israelius response to khomeinis appointment of parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani as acting commanderinchief of irans 
armed forces 
khomeini named rafsanjani one of his closest aides as military 
chief in the wake of two battlefield defeats by iraq in the nearly 
8yearold gulf war 
khomeini has long been reported to be in a frail condition since 
he suffered a heart attack two years ago touching off scores of 
reports he was dead or dying 
he was last seen in public may 13 when he briefly shuffled into 
the street outside his heavily guarded home in the north tehran 
suburb of jamaran to vote in parliamentary elections 
khomeini held the post of comanderinchief under irans 
revolutionary constitution and had only relinquished it once before 
since 1979 when he appointed president abdolhassan bani sadr in 
1980 bani sadr fled iran a year later hounded by radicals who 
considered him too liberal 
khomeinis apppointment of rafsanjani rekindled speculation that 
the aging patriarchs condition was deteriorating khomeini has 
appeared fragile and slowmoving in his few recent public 
appearances broadcast by irans staterun television also 
monitored in nicosia 
speculation that khomeini was ailing heightened friday after 
irna reported that rafsanjani and president ali khamenei had 
visited khomeinis designated successor ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri in the holy city of qom 100 miles south of tehran on 
wednesday and thursday 
the agency said the men discussed various current issues 
with montazeri but it did not elaborate or give any indication 
that the meetings were linked to khomeinis health 
rafsanjani and khamenei are rivals in the power struggle under 
way within the tehran hierarchy over who will run the country in 
the postkhomeini era 
although khomeini has designated montazeri 65 his successor 
the highranking cleric lacks khomeinis power base 
he also has been opposed by several leading figures including 
rafsanjani long considered the most powerful figure in iran after 
khomeini 
when the patriatch appointed rafsanjani as military leader he 
said he had acted at the urging of khamenei chairman of the 
supreme defense council 
but most analysts believe that khomeini said that to avoid 
publicly humiliating khamenei whose power has been eroded in 
recent months and deepening the political divisions in iran

a substantial majority of americans say they 
would not vote for ronald reagan winner of two landslide 
presidential elections if he could seek a third term a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
most republicans in the national poll supported reagan for 
another term but democrats and independents whose support was 
critical to his 1980 and 1984 victories said overwhelmingly they 
would not back him again 
the decline in reagans support outside his own party could 
impede his ability to draw nonrepublicans to vice president george 
bush who has locked up the 1988 gop presidential nomination bush 
needs outside votes to win 
in another finding threequarters of the 1204 respondents said 
a vice presidential candidates race or sex did not matter to them 
however some independents and republicans were less likely to 
support a black and some republicans were less likely to support a 
woman 
the survey also found that americans overwhelmingly would not 
want to be president and a plurality would not want their child to 
have the job still 59 percent thought it possible their child 
could be president 
in 1984 reagan won 25 percent of democrats and 63 percent of 
independent voters but in the survey just 13 percent of democrats 
and 27 percent of independents said they would vote for him for a 
third term 
presidents are limited by constitutional amendment to two 
fouryear terms in office and roughly 65 percent each of 
republicans democrats and independents favored maintaining that 
limit 
but if reagan could run again 60 percent of republicans said 
they would vote for him while 85 percent of democrats and 67 
percent of independents said they would not the total was 32 
percent for reagan 64 percent against 
majorities of conservatives moderates and liberals alike 
opposed a third reagan term women and poorer americans were more 
likely to object 
on vice presidential candidates 75 percent said it would not 
matter to them if a tickets second slot were filled by a black or 
a woman 
still 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely 
to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president compared with 
4 percent who would be more likely to back it the division was 
wider among republicans while there was no measurable split among 
democrats 
no potential candidate was specified in the survey black civil 
rights activist jesse jackson secondplace finisher for the 
democratic nomination for president has said he should be 
considered for the vice presidential slot 
with a woman for vice president 20 percent of republicans said 
they would be less likely to support the ticket compared with 6 
percent more likely there was no such reluctance among democrats 
or independents 
again no potential candidate was specified there have been 
suggestions that bush select a woman running mate to shore up his 
support among women 
overall 10 percent of the respondents said they would be more 
likely to support a woman for vice president and 14 percent said 
less likely that split came within the margin of sampling error of 
three points 
given a black vice presidential candidate 6 percent overall 
said they would be more likely to lend their support 18 percent 
less likely 
more than six in 10 said it would not matter to them if a 
candidate for president were a black or a woman five percent said 
they would be more likely to support a black for president 27 
percent less likely ten percent said they would be more likely to 
back a woman 25 percent less likely 
asked if they would want the job of president 89 percent said 
no fortysix percent said they would not want their child to grow 
up to be president while 41 percent would 
but 89 percent said it matters who gets the job

two days after banning calls 
for election boycotts the government sunday launched an 
advertising campaign to promote participation in municipal 
elections scheduled for october 
fullpage newspaper ads urged south africans to let your vote 
speak for you in the nationwide elections oct 26 
vote for a better life for yourself and those who are dear to 
you said another ad let the people of south africa be heard 
it will be the first time south africans of all races go to the 
polls on the same day they will be voting for more than 7000 
seats on municipal councils in their racially segregated 
communities 
most antiapartheid organizations in south africa as well as 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement oppose 
black participation in any elections until the black majority is 
granted full political rights at the national level 
the black anc movement is fighting the governments policy of 
apartheid which establishes a racially segregated society in which 
the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the government while describing itself as prodemocracy 
says it will never accept a oneperson onevote system that would 
allow the blacks to overrule the 5 million whites 
on friday when it extended a national state of emergency for a 
third year the government imposed a new regulation outlawing calls 
for boycotts of elections except by a registered political party 
competing in an election 
the farright conservative party which opposes even limited 
concessions to blacks charged that the 23 million ad campaign 
constitutes use of taxpayers money to spread propaganda on behalf 
of president pw bothas national party 
a confidential outline of the ad campaign disclosed by a 
conservative party leader who obtained a copy said the 
governments public credibility was not good an advertising agency 
suggested in the document that animated cartoon characters be used 
in television ads to promote voting because direct communication 
from the government might be unacceptable to the public 
information minister stoffel van der merwe defended the campaign 
last week saying it was not partisan 
it is prodemocracy and antirevolutionary for which we do 
not apologize he said 
the ads published sunday exhorted voters to vote for the 
candidate who will best look after your interests 
the white municipal elections will provide the conservative 
party with another chance to gain strength at the expense of the 
national party the conservatives won three parliamentary 
byelections earlier this year and they predict a sweep of local 
elections in towns and small cities throughout transvaal province 
in the north where more than half of south africas whites live 
the key question in the black municipal elections is whether the 
government can prevent disruptions by militants and persuade a 
significant number of candidates to participate despite the 
likelihood that these will be depicted as apologists for the 
government 
defense minister magnus malan told parliament last month that 
radicals and revolutionaries regard the elections as a prime 
target for disruption and intimidation 
it is my duty and your duty to ensure that these elections are 
a success he told lawmakers

a longtime friend of house speaker jim 
wright says he paid wright 6000 for copies of his books as a 
legal way to get around federal limits on campaign contributions 
fort worth developer s gene payte who has known wright since 
he entered congress in 1955 told the fort worth startelegram he 
bought 1000 copies of the book to show my appreciation 
federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to 
1000 for each election 
payte said knew about the limit but wanted to find a way to 
boost wrights income the startelegram reported sunday 
if i wanted to help jim and wanted to give him some money i 
couldnt do it he said but i could buy his books 
payte also said he wrote letters to nearly 50 fort worth 
businessmen urging them each to buy 1000 worth of the books but 
did not know if they followed up on the request he would not name 
them 
the house ethics committee decided last week to conduct a 
inquiry to determine if wright has violated rules on ethics and 
conflicts of interest 
one aspect of the inquiry will be the publication arrangements 
for his 1984 book reflections of a public man 
fort worth orthodontist gene wood another longtime wright 
friend said he paid 1000 to publisher william carlos moore after 
moore told him he was trying to put together a group of about 20 
people to finance republication of the book last year 
i paid to have some republished and a big box of books was 
sent to me wood said he added that he had already given wright 
the maximum 1000 in campaign contributions 
wright has acknowledged that some supporters bought large 
numbers of books but said it wasnt an attempt to get around 
contribution limits 
i think thats a mistake wright said i dont think 
anybody really thought that 
wright instead said im glad they thought enough of the 
book 
meanwhile another longtime fort worth friend of wright said he 
was present when wright asked a congressional aide if he would 
sacrifice a couple of weekends to work on the book 
ben procter professor of history at texas christian university 
located in fort worth recalled the request in a sworn statement 
wright provided the ethics committee friday 
one charge the committee will investigate is whether wright paid 
the aide matthew cossolotto 2000 in public money to help 
compile the book 
the house ethics manual says congressional employees may not be 
paid from public funds to perform personal or campaign activities 
on behalf of a congressman

william santiago used to sit back and chuckle when 
an alligator ventured onto the lawn of his lakefront home but now 
he says hell blast any gator foolish enough to crawl within pistol 
range 
for santiago and other waterfront residents in florida the 
alligators image has changed dramatically from an amusing visitor 
to a deadly menace a change prompted by the recent fatal 
alligator attack on a 4yearold girl in the gulf coast community 
of englewood 
erin glover was walking a dog with two playmates in the 
ankledeep water of a pond june 4 when a 10 footlong bull gator 
lunged from the water and snapped the child in its jaws dragging 
her underwater to her death 
for santiago the turf war between man and beast heats up 
whenever he broils a couple of steaks on his charcoal grill in the 
dade county neighborhood wafting an aroma that one 6foot 
neighborhood gator finds irresistible 
he crawls up the bank right into our back yard and sits there 
with his back arched just staring said santiago a 67yearold 
cuban exile who moved in last year the last time i went and got 
my gun but he saw me coming and ran away 
were seeing a lot of panic out there said lt dick 
lawrence of the florida game and freshwater fish commission 
in the week following erins death game officials in the 
states five regional offices were swamped with 849 complaints from 
residents wanting alligators removed about five times the normal 
load 
i try to calm them down but they wont take no for an 
answer said lawrence who supervises the nuisancealligator 
program in 10 south florida counties some say if we dont come 
out there and destroy the gator in their neighborhood theyre 
going to do it themselves 
game officials last week received a report that a hysterical 
woman living near the fatal attack bashed a 3foot gators head 
in 
it made her feel a little bit better but it didnt accomplish 
anything said lt jim farrior of the game commisson adding that 
alligators that small eat only minnows and frogs not people 
about 80 percent of the complaints result in a permit issued to 
destroy the gator said lt mitchell brown in lakeland last year 
3853 alligators were killed he said 
our main concerns are with a gator thats been fed said lt 
jim huffstodt a game commission spokesman in west palm beach 
people think its real cute to treat the gator like a pet and 
give it a name and toss it scraps of food and marshmallows 
over time the gator loses its fear of people and begins to 
associate people with food thats setting the stage for a 
tragedy huffstodt said he added that any bold action toward 
humans pets or livestock is enough to order a gator destroyed 
that job is turned over to statelicensed trappers a select 
group of experts allowed to kill alligators and profit from the 
armored underbelly skin and the blandtasting meat 
but the fact is the odds of getting attacked by a gator in 
florida are about the same as getting struck by lightning game 
officials say 
the latest death marks the sixth documented gator killing along 
with 95 unprovoked attacks in florida since 1948 according to game 
commission statistics 
these are the consequences we face as a growing state where 
people choose to crowd their houses onto the alligators native 
habitat said bernie yokel of the florida audubon society in 
maitland we sometimes forget the gator was here first 
biologists estimate there are anywhere from 1 million to 6 
million gators in florida nesting in swamps and marshes and even 
winding their way through drainage tunnels into freshwater pockets 
of sprawling urban areas 
in september the state will lift a 1962 hunting ban and open a 
tightly controlled monthlong season with a strict kill limit of 
3000 gators a number not expected to make a dent in the huge 
population 
but homeowner santiago says he still feels a cold shiver of fear 
whenever he hears the gators low bellow in the night 
santiago has forbidden his nine young grandchildren from playing 
near the water when they visit he has ordered a chainlink fence 
built around his home and he has called on game officials to remove 
his problem gator 
i couldnt live with myself he said if anything happened 
to one of my grandchildren

the two presidential contenders sought sunday to broaden their 
appeal among blacks with republican george bush urging a strong 
civil rights agenda and democrat michael dukakis meeting with black 
mayors and promising a tough policy in the war on drugs 
dukakis in a speech to the us conference of mayors in salt 
lake city lashed out at the reagan administrations antidrug 
programs criticizing the presidents cuts in the coast guard 
budget and federal aid to state and local police in light of his 
tough rhetoric on the issue 
what we have today is chaos dukakis said weve got to 
back up what we say with what we do 
the massachusetts governor also met with democratic mayors and 
held a private session with a smaller group of black mayors 
the likely democratic nominee called for tougher drug laws and 
stringent sentencing guidelines but he stopped short of urging 
capital punishment for drug dealers bush has criticized dukakis 
for failing to endorse the death penalty for major drug traffickers 
the vice president meanwhile delivered the commencement 
address at a predominantly black college in wilberforce ohio 
where he told the 275 graduates of central state university that 
the nation needs a positive civil rights agenda 
bush added that the policy must go beyond that to knock down 
the walls of indifference and other barriers that result in 
economic exclusion 
the certain gop nominee responding to reporters questions 
said he would work to broaden the base of our party talk on the 
issues that i think transcend black white american issues that 
are out there and are going to appeal 
bush who celebrated his 64th birthday received an honorary 
doctor of laws degree from the college the award was announced 
last year but bush was unable to receive it until sunday said ed 
chamness a spokesman for the university 
in his speech bush told the graduates they made it though 
college despite poverty broken homes inadequate schools and the 
social challenges or threat of drugs and violence 
dukakis focusing on the drug issue in his speech to the 
nations mayors said that the war on drugs can be won but we 
have to recognize that it is a war a war of wills a war of 
values a war of confidence and courage and strength 
dukakis promised that if elected he would increase federal law 
enforcement staffs and federal aid to state and local police he 
did not provide specifics 
he also said he would issue an executive order prohibiting the 
payment of cia or other government funds to suspected drug dealers 
a reference to alleged payments to panamanian ruler manuel antonio 
noriega 
never again never again are you going to bankroll a drug 
peddler who is poisoning our society and killing our children 
dukakis said 
jesse jackson runnerup to dukakis in the presidential 
nomination sweepstakes appeared to back down from claims that the 
democrats should offer him the vice presidency based on his 
secondplace showing 
asked if in his recent comments he was saying he should be 
offered the nomination and then would decide whether to accept it 
jackson said no im not saying that because i do not want to 
push mike dukakis to that point its not necessary 
jackson interviewed on nbctvs meet the press said he has 
not made a decision on whether he would accept the vice presidency 
but added i believe ive earned serious consideration 
jackson backed efforts by his supporters meeting in michigan 
with other democrats on the party platform to include a call for 
raising taxes on the rich in the proposed plank 
we ought to be candid with the american people jackson 
said theres no miraculous way of getting out of this budget 
deficit we certainly cannot come out just by collecting the 
uncollected taxes of reaganomics we must collect some exempted 
taxes of reaganomics 
jackson said that president reagan has given the republicans a 
party now they must pay for the party 
the democrats winding up their weekend meeting sidestepped the 
question of the federal deficit and whether to call for higher 
taxes on the rich 
the party regulars did agree to brand south africa a terrorist 
state called for the appointment of a federal drug czar adoption 
of the equal rights amendment an end to homelessness expansion of 
aids research and providing advance notice of plant closings 
i found more areas of agreement than disagreement said rep 
william gray iii of pennsylvania the drafting panels chair 
following the threeday meeting on mackinac island

and two decatur counties and mayor gary anderson mailed a white 
glove to each to begin the competition memorial day weekend 
the official tshirt of the contest has a united states map on

lewellen decatur townships surfaced theres even one in san 
juan county wash population 20 except in the summer when its 
100 many of them dont even have a zip code 
her count rose to 25 the decatur herald amp review did some 
additional research and identified 28 decaturs 
im not sure were through finding decaturs yet said the 
mayor but the more the merrier 
all are welcome in the contest which has has been divided into 
three divisions based on population there are no prizes said the 
mayor just satisfaction and pride 
officials from all the decaturs will be invited to the opening 
ceremony of decatur celebration here aug 5 the winners will be 
announced then although some decatur officials figure they have 
victory wrapped up 
theres no doubt in my mind said mayor bobby wilson of 
decatur texas weve never been beaten at anything ill be 
there to pick up my firstplace trophy and to bring yall some 
chili and jalapeno peppers 
the mayor of decatur ga promised anderson a consolation prize 
of a pinto beanandpeanut butter sandwich and mayor bill dukes of 
decatur ala said schoolchildren brought 7000 cans of food in 
just one day and were going to beat decatur ill

a special commission created by gov mario 
cuomo called sunday for cuts in federal spending consideration of 
tax increases and a longer school year to deal with what it says is 
the countrys economic crisis 
the cuomo commission on trade and competitiveness said the 
nations leaders should consider a freeze on military spending 
taxing social security benefits of wealthier americans and a 
reduction of farm subsidies that benefit large producers 
the commission also recommmended higher taxes for luxury items 
and consideration of a 10perbarrel oil import fee and the 
imposition of a valueadded tax on goods and services the 
commission said that if adopted both the oil import fee and the 
valueadded tax should be structured to insulate the poor 
the commission believes that future fiscal policy must be 
based on a combination of reduced spending and increased revenue 
said the 259page report from the 20member task force that 
included businessmen labor leaders and economists 
the cuomo commission report is being published as a paperback by 
simon and schuster and will be available in book stores as early as 
monday said cuomo spokeswoman anne crowley 
cuomo once considered a potential 1988 democratic presidential 
candidate has been pushing economic reform for months in addition 
to creating the cuomo commission in january 1987 the new york 
governor led the drive for the national economic commission which 
was approved by president reagan in december 
the commission which is due to report after the november 
election is headed by former democratic party chairman robert 
strauss and republican drew lewis a former us secretary of 
transportation other members include chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
and new york financier felix rohatyn 
the national commission is to prepare recommendations on the 
national deficit trade imbalance third world debt and 
productivity the same issues dealt with by the cuomo commission 
the word crisis has been cheapened by too frequent use but 
no other word so well describes americas present situation the 
cuomo commission concluded either america will implement reforms 
that strengthen the international trading system and make the 
nation more competitive at home or it risks a long slow national 
decline 
the major problems facing the nation on the economic front are 
the trade deficit and the federal deficit according to the 
commission 
the commission said the united states must improve its 
production capabilities in part through greater employee 
participation work to improve living conditions and create new 
markets in the third world by among other things helping 
restructure debt payments for developing nations and stabilize the 
international monetary system 
repairing roads and bridges was given a high priority by the 
group as was giving the nations youth the tools with which to 
compete 
we need a longer school year said the commission 
japanese students attend school 240 days a year european 
students on average 220 days in the us the average school 
year is 180 days the shorter school year clearly places 
american students at an educational disadvantage

a usowned supertanker anchored off 
bahrain on sunday after an iranian gunboat attack that apparently 
caught us military officials in the persian gulf by surprise 
the 258979ton esso demetia which flies the british flag was 
about 45 miles off the saudi arabian coast when it was ambushed by 
two or three armed speedboats just before dusk saturday 
iranian attacks in that area are extremely rare and perhaps 
unprecedented said one us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the attack ignited several fires aboard the supertanker but 
caused no casualties said gulfbased shipping executives speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the nearest american warship the guided missile frigate 
halyburton was 45 miles away and it would have taken it 1 hours 
to reach the stricken ship 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr brad goforth said that by the time 
the 3600ton frigate met the tanker heading for humanitarian 
assistance the esso demetia was sailing toward bahrain under its 
own power had the fires under control and did not request help 
goforth said us officials would not speculate further on the 
attack on the arab side of the gulf far from iran and the 
customary haunts of its revolutionary guard raiders 
the supertanker was originally reported to be britishowned but 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit on sunday said it was 
usowned but it didnt know the firm 
senior us officers have said iran appeared to be testing us 
forces following april 18 clashes in which six of irans naval 
craft were sunk or disabled 
a us officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
daylight raid on the esso demetia was a surprise not something 
anyone was really looking for 
its probably supposed to prove they can hit a ship anywhere 
they want to he said 
available records show that there have been no ship attacks by 
iran in the waters immediately north of bahrain and east of saudia 
arabia for several years 
iraq and iran have been fighting since 1980 
the esso demetia attack was one of two raids on ships in four 
hours saturday 
a filipino crewman was killed and two others wounded in the 
earlier raid on the 11744ton west german container ship 
dhaulagiri in the strait of hormuz 350 miles to the southeast 
shipping executives said the raids were apparently in 
retaliation for iraqi air strikes on irans oil shipping iraq 
claimed attacks thursday and friday but only the first was verified 
independently 
under recently expanded rules of engagement us warships 
may respond to requests for help from ships under attack in 
international waters regardless of what flag they fly american 
ships cannot help vessels carrying warrelated or contraband cargo 
previously us warships could defend only usflagged vessels 
since the tougher policy went into effect may 3 iran has 
carried out six gunboat attacks all far enough from patrolling 
us warships that they could not intervene 
baghdads official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia 
quoted a military communique as saying iraqi jets shot down an 
iranian f14 tomcat fighter over the gulf saturday 
but irans official islamic republic news agency denied that

spaceage cartoon heroes will never 
threaten the place of superman in the heart of this southern 
illinois community which is celebrating the 50th birthday of its 
hometown boy 
hes an adopted son so to speak mayor richard corzine said 
sunday this is about the 10th annual superman celebration hes 
one of the big highlights for the town 
almost 20000 people gathered over the weekend in metropolis for 
a superhero birthday party contests for superboys supergirls and 
superdogs a mock bank robbery and a superman baseball tournament 
corzine said 
superman arrived on earth from the planet krypton in action 
comics in february 1938 his alter ego was clark kent who worked 
at the fictional daily planet in the imaginary city of metropolis 
the real metropolis realized during tough economic times in the 
early 1970s that it was the only us city with the name of 
supermans home so it claimed the man of steel for its own 
billboards tout the adopted son on route 45 at both ends of 
town the water tower bears a picture of superman a statue of him 
stands overlooking the main street the chamber of commerce has a 
telephone booth where kids can talk to him and the local newspaper 
is named the metropolis planet 
but superman or at least the man whos playing him this year 
is not a mildmannered reporter hes a service manager for the 
local chevrolet dealer who acknowledges that donning the superman 
outfit is a little bit like going outside in your underwear 
its the kids that make it worthwhile said mike boyd whose 
6foot5 inch 230pound frame fits the comic book image boyd in 
his second year of playing superman said sunday he had signed 
about 500 autographs 
a lot of grandmothers are asking for pictures he said 
they want a picture taken and an autograph to send to grandkids 
somewhere 
boyd stepped out of a policeescorted limousine thursday night 
to kick off the celebration in this peaceful ohio river town of 
7200 which rolled out a 5footby3foot cake enough to supply 
a piece for every celebrant

an estimated 150000 people will 
develop aids this year doubling the number of estimated aids cases 
worldwide since the epidemic began the world health organization 
said sunday 
aids is changing the world said jonathan mann director of 
the world health organizations aids program it has become a key 
part of the history of our time 
he spoke at the opening session of the fourth international 
conference on aids in stockholm 
the number of aids cases officially reported to the world health 
organization stood at 75392 on jan 12 and 96433 as of june 1 
the number of actual cases is estimated to be 200000 mann said 
although aids was not identified until 1981 the origins of the 
epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s 
a virus spread across the world and we didnt even know it 
existed mann said it is or should be shocking to our 
modern pride that such a global expansion could occur without even 
being detected 
mann said the five years after 1981 marked a period of 
extraordinary discovery in which the ways in which aids spread 
were identified the virus was isolated and an aids antibody test 
was developed 
lars kallings chairman of the aids conference said the meeting 
allowed scientists to assemble their findings like the pieces of a 
jigsaw puzzle into a large picture of the aids epidemic 
im afraid that the picture in its entirety will be 
frightening he said 
mann described the three distinct patterns of aids spread that 
make up the worldwide epidemic pattern i he said is that seen in 
the united states and western europe where the disease appeared 
first in homosexuals and bisexuals 
heterosexual transmission is growing in those areas the virus 
is spreading rapidly among drug abusers through their shared 
needles but blood supplies have now been made safe by screening 
for the virus 
pattern ii mann said characterizes africa and parts of latin 
america and the caribbean where the aids spread has been 
predominantly among heterosexuals 
pattern iii refers to the delayed spread of aids in eastern 
europe the middle east north africa and most countries in asia 
and the pacific 
only 1 percent of the aids cases reported to the world health 
organization come from pattern iii countries mann said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a 
virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible 
to a wide variety of infections and cancers

jury selection was sscheduled to begin 
monday in pittsburgh for the murder trial of a man charged with 
torturing and raping six women killing two of them and whose 
freezer contained human body parts 
gary heidnik who is white is accused of keeping black women 
chained in the basement of his row house where survivors have 
testified he dug screwdrivers into their ears raped them almost 
every day and fed them dog food 
six jurors had been chosen in philadelphia when common pleas 
judge lynne m abraham agreed to a defense request to move jury 
selection out of town those six jurors were dismissed state chief 
justice robert nc nix chose allegheny county for jury selection 
those chosen will be sequestered for the trial in philadelphia 
the judge ordered the change of jury selection because heidnik 
44 had his lawyer tell the court he didnt believe he would get a 
fair shake from philadelphians 
heidnik has a history of mistreating women and was confined to 
maximumsecurity mental hospital after a 1978 conviction for 
kidnapping a retarded person he was charged with raping heidnik 
told a judge he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic 
defense attorney a charles peruto jr has said heidnik an army 
veteran with a psychiatric disability was a subject of army lsd 
experiments in the mid1960s that aggravated his schizophrenia the 
army says there is nothing in heidniks records showing that but 
peruto has said he has documents to back up his claim in court 
peruto and the prosecutor assistant district attorney charles 
gallagher have been barred by a judge from making any public 
comments on the case at least until the jury is chosen 
heidnik selfstyled minister of a church he created and 
operated in his home also turned out to be a financial whiz 
turning 35000 into a stock portfolio worth more than 500000 in 
10 years 
heidnik was arrested in march 1987 after a woman told police she 
had escaped from him 
police said they found three other women aged 18 to 24 and 
naked from the waist down chained in the basement two to a pipe 
and the other in a waterfilled pit when they were released they 
ran into the street crying free at last 
in a freezer were 24 pounds of human limbs with other body parts 
in a kitchen refrigerator police said the woman who said she 
escaped later led detectives to a remote forest area in southern 
new jersey where they found the body of debbi johnson 23 
authorities said ms johnson was electrocuted while standing in 
the waterfilled pit when the defendant allegedly touched electric 
wires to her chains 
heidnik also is accused of killing sandra lindsay 24 she died 
while hanging for days by one hand shackled to a basement pipe 
authorities said 
district attorney ronald castille said after heidniks arrest 
that the reason it took so long to arrest him was that despite 
complaints from neighbors police had no probable cause 
we cant go walking into peoples houses said police 
inspector james gallagher we cant just go kicking in doors and 
running in 
in 1986 heidniks estranged wife obtained an order prohibiting 
him from physically striking harrassing or threatening her 
the document filed in family court said heidnik regularly picked 
up black handicapped women for the purpose of having sex with 
them 
when neighbors complained in february 1987 a month before his 
arrest about a smell coming from his home heidnik told police that 
a pot of meat had burned 
its just amazing to me that this could have gone on as long 
as it did in the city without someone picking it up said karen 
kulp executive director of women organized against rape

democrat michael dukakis responded with a bit of 
mimicry when he received a mock congratulatory telegram from 
president reagan and his wife nancy at a press roast 
thank you dan said the straightfaced recipient 
dan yes dan as in cbs anchorman dan rather who had an 
infamous interview with dukakis republican opponent george bush 
and dan as in the name bush repeatedly used to refer to his 
interviewer ted koppel on abctvs nightline program last 
week 
it was a night of lampoons saturday as dukakis was honored by 
the boston press photographers association the massachusetts 
governor poked fun at his chief rival selection of a running mate 
and even himself 
dukakis told the gathering he took a break that afternoon to go 
to a harvard boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow a 
toungeincheek jibe at bushs characterization of dukakis as an 
elitist 
he joked about picking a vice president pointing a finger down 
the head table at steve nelson a former linebacker for the new 
england patriots football team 
he knows something about defense and im interested in 
conventional defense dukakis told his receptive and laughing 
audience ive been thinking about nelson 
the unusually festive dukakis who rarely tries to be funny 
accepted the barbs as well as dishing them out 
master of ceremonies bob warren presented him with a cardboard 
presidential seal with a likeness of a cod in place of the bald 
eagle 
he laughed again when another seal was attached to the podium 
the sign said the official seal of the next president of the 
united states 
and he roared when warren presented him with catalogs and a 
shopping bag from one of washingtons pricier shops telling 
dukakis they were for his wife kitty whose penchant for finer 
clothing contrasts sharply with her husbands love of 
bargainbasement suits 
we know you dont shop said warren 
the host told dukakis he had the boston press to thank for 
helping him develop that finetuned media style the rest of the 
nation now finds so riveting and charasmatic 
for the sake of fairness warren noted bushs attacks on 
dukakis suburban upbringing and fired back 
kennebunkport isnt exactly tent city you know a reference

the estate of a cancer victim who worked 
around asbestos is suing a tobacco company charging that it failed 
to warn people the two substances are a dangerous combination 
the case of john ray gunsalus vs american tobacco co is 
believed to be the first to come to trial linking tobacco and 
asbestos the philadelphia inquirer reported sunday 
gunsalus who smoked two packs of pall malls daily worked at 
shipyard jobs that left him covered with asbestos jurors were told 
last week he died last year at age 55 after smoking since age 11 
in 1985 the surgeon general reported that people who work near 
asbestos are five times as likely to get lung cancer as people who 
do not come in contact with the substance smokers are 10 times 
more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers but people who 
work near asbestos and smoke are 50 times more likely to get cancer 
than people who do neither according to the report 
attorney thomas f johnson who is representing gunsalus 
estate told the eightmember jury during opening arguments tuesday 
that gunsalus should have been told of the dangerous combination of 
asbestos and cigarettes 
the tobacco company should have issued special warnings about 
the added dangers of smoking for people who work around asbestos 
according to the estate which contends that gunsalus never knew of 
the danger 
the estate originally sued about 12 asbestos companies along 
with american tobacco the maker of pall malls claims against nine 
asbestos companies were dismissed and three were settled before the 
trial began according to court records 
lawyers would not discuss the terms of the settlements and us 
district judge norma l shapiro has ordered that jurors not be told 
about the settlements 
american tobacco contends that it was gunsalus choice to smoke 
despite warnings from friends and relatives that cigarettes were 
cancer sticks 
he is the type of person on whom a warning would have made no 
difference whatsoever said edward f mannino the tobacco 
companys attorney in his opening arguments 
mannino argued that the cancer that killed gunsalus was a rare 
type not statistically related to cigarette smoking 
the only period for which cigarette makers can be held liable 
according to federal court appeals decisions is prior to 1966 
that year health warnings began to be placed on cigarette packs 
gunsalus was diagnosed with cancer of the lung liver and head 
in 1985 
monday will be the first anniversary of gunsalus death at the 
veterans administration medical center in philadelphia his death 
certificate listed the cause of death as a brain tumor caused by 
lung cancer which led to a fatal drop in blood pressure

republican presidential hopeful george 
bush in an effort to broaden his support among blacks on sunday 
urged the use of federal aid to assist minority businesses 
i support strongly increased minority development efforts by 
the federal government we must bring black americans and other 
minorities into the free enterprise system as we must into the 
government bush said as he delivered the commencement address at 
predominantly black central state university 
the vice presidents pledge is a break with the reagan 
administration which has opposed state and local programs that set 
aside a portion of contracts for members of a particular race 
the setasides have been used by federal state and local 
governments as a way to remedy past racial discrimination against 
minority businessmen 
in his speech bush called for a a positive civil rights 
agenda one that protects the civil rights of every american but 
he said the policy must go beyond that to knock down the walls of 
indifference and other barriers that result in economic exclusion 
the vice president told the 275 central state graduates they 
made it thrugh college despite poverty broken homes inadequate 
schools and the social challenges or threat of drugs and 
violence 
he urged them to continue taking risks and become among those 
americans who create one million businesses a year 
risktaking is the heartbeat of the american dream he said 
and the resulting economic growth lets those just entering the job 
market get a piece of the pie without taking it away from someone 
whos already there 
bush responding to questions from reporters said he would work 
to broaden the base of our party talk on the issues that i think 
transcend black white american issues that are out there and are 
going to appeal 
bush who celebrated his 64th birthday on sunday was awarded an 
honorary doctor of laws degree the award was announced last year 
but bush was unable to receive until sunday said ed chamness a 
spokesman for the university 
in honor of the vice presidents birthday a reporter presented 
bush with a tshirt bearing a photo of embattled attorney general 
edwin meese iii and the inscription what me worry 
but the vice president refused to show the shirt to reporters 
during a tour of the neighboring national afroamerican museum 
prior to the speech 
bush met privately with about 20 local dignitaries at the museum 
and was presented with two paintings by willis bing davis a 
central state professor whose paintings are on display 
bush later flew to to danville va where he campaigned for 
republican congressional candidate linda arey

an antigang police task force codenamed 
the hammer dropped down on the citys streets over the weekend 
making nearly 1400 arrests and recovering drugs and firearms 
meanwhile the suburban city of paramount was cited by the 
washingtonbased national civic league as one of 10 allamerican 
cities for its efforts to defeat street gangs 
the police sweep conducted friday and saturday nights throughout 
the city resulted in issuance of hundreds of misdemeanor warrants 
seizures of small quantities of drugs and impoundment of several 
automobiles authorities said 
officers also gathered intelligence filling out hundreds of 
field identifications forms of suspected and known gang members for 
future reference 
the actions are major skirmishes in what police chief daryl 
gates calls a war on the rotten little cowards and followed 
the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen 
20 percent this year 
the report cited 96 gangrelated killings in the city this year 
through the end of may compared to 80 in the same period a year 
ago 
in all of los angeles county there have been 138 gangrelated 
killings this year in 1987 gang slayings totaled 387 countywide 
authorities estimate there are as many as 70000 gang members in 
the city and los angeles county 
along with confiscations of rock or crack cocaine and the 
hallucinogenic drug pcp several weapons were confiscated 
including an ak47 assault rifle said lt jim tatreau 
the city of paramount southeast of los angeles was named 
saturday by the national civic league 
the citation noted that earlier this decade the suburb was 
faced with urban problems and a high crime rate that put it on a 
list of 14 cities around the country labeled disaster areas 
but since then 2900 youths have participated in an 
alternative to gang membership program in six years and only 
15 were later identified by authorities as gang members 
about 1700 properties have been cleaned up by more than 980

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher welcomes a soviet suggestion on a conventional arms treaty 
with the west but only as a starting point for future negotiations 
genschers spokesman said sunday 
this will have to be looked at very closely but it does show 
a new thinking in the soviet union spokesman juergen chrobog 
told the associated press 
he was referring to remarks by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze last week in new york indicating the warsaw pact 
alliance was ready to make cuts in its conventional forces that 
would not have to be matched equally by the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
at a conference on eastwest security saturday in potsdam east 
germany genscher said he greeted the apparent change in the 
kremlins position 
this speech in new york by shevardnadze is welcomed because 
now it has been clearly stated that everywhere there is an warsaw 
pact advantage asymmetrical cuts will have to be made genscher 
said at the threeday conference that ended saturday 
this is very important for us in view of the superiority by 
the eastern side in largescale equipment such as tanks he 
added 
earlier in the potsdam conference other soviet officials said 
the warsaw pact was ready to make asymmetrical cuts in its tank 
force but they linked such reductions with elimination of natos 
advantages in fighter aircraft and attack helicopters 
chrobog said genscher was pleased with the soviet statements on 
conventional arms but these are matters which we have to analyze 
further along with west germanys nato allies 
during the potsdam conference the soviet deputy foreign 
minister ivan aboymov outlined the latest soviet proposals 
calling for a threestage reduction of conventional forces in 
europe 
he said the first stage would be an elimination of force 
imbalances between nato and the warsaw pact followed by a 
reduction of 500000 troops on each side and then restructuring the 
remaining forces to give them a defensive rather than offensive 
capability

product directions often seem simple 
press firmly is a typical instruction but how firmly 
design engineers at tufts university are researching ways to 
make such orders more specific 
they began after learning that owners of homes with a certain 
kind of gas valve were asked to test them by pressing a knob firmly 
without forcing it with no more than those directions the owners 
were expected to determine whether their valves were defective and 
possibly dangerous 
the goal of the research is the ability to craft phrases that 
will produce welldefined physical responses said professor john 
g kreifeldt 
a graduate student in design engineering at tufts kodali vn 
rao developed an experiment to see if product directions could be 
made more simple 
from nail polish to computers cameras to hair sprays and 
toasters to tanks the designer needs to be wellinformed about the 
consequences resulting from use or misuse of the product said 
rao as designers we have to decide that a switch should work 
with a certain amount of force 
but how does one go about communicating that he wondered 
in his research he asked about 240 people to squeeze a device 
attached to a meter either gently or hard 
the results varied considerably the instruction firm 
covered a range of two kilograms to 32 kilograms of force 
the projects most surprising result when the instructions were 
changed to squeeze not very hard and not too gently the test 
participants were remarkably consistent ninety percent of the 
participants applied 129 to 146 kilograms of force 
rao said that the word not in instructions causes people to 
be more cautious about how much pressure they exert 
force is a perceivable thing that people can use through 
experience said rao one thing is sure oneword instructions 
dont convey enough information if you say do this people tend 
to get carried away by presuppositions so it is important to give 
users parameters

central and southern california 
daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the sunday 
quake was related to the one which struck friday

as many as 60 children may have eluded 
social workers who rounded up and removed residents of a boarding 
home under investigation for abuse the state welfare department 
chief said sunday 
but state welfare commissioner thomas brittain said he was 
unsure how many children may have been left behind when students 
from the bethel home for children near lucedale were removed friday 
by the workers armed with a court order 
there are still a whole lot of kids out there wandering around 
somewhere that were released through a totally inappropriate 
manner brittain said at a sunday news conference 
he said 66 children had been taken into custody including a 
runaway brought to a state mental institution early sunday morning 
the children were rounded up near the campus of the 28acre 
home at restaurants and along roadways 
even as welfare workers continued trying to reunite some of the 
youngsters with their familes the rev herman fountain the homes 
operator said he was sheltering four or five youngsters who fled 
the home before the workers arrived 
ive still got a few soldiers left and im trying to work 
back to what it was before said fountain 38 who established 
the fundamentalist christian home 10 years ago as what he calls a 
last refuge for troubled kids 
fountain says he is a former heroin addict and his experiences 
on the streets of new york city qualify him to work with such 
children 
fountains comments drew a tightlipped response from the judge 
who ordered the welfare department to remove children from the home 
that has come under criticism intermittently since 1980 
ill deal with it but ill deal with it monday chancery 
judge robert oswald said in a telephone interview from his home 
a court hearing is set for monday morning in lucedale to decide 
where the children taken from bethel will be placed 
brittain said between 10 and 15 children already had been 
released to their parents 
the commissioner said he was satisfied with the states handling 
of the situation and was not worried that some parents might want 
to sue the state for removing the children 
oswald ruled friday that children at bethel who range in age 
from 10 to 17 and are mostly from outside mississippi were 
subjected to physical abuse medical neglect and detention 
amounting to imprisonment he ordered their immediate removal 
brittain who supervised the childrens removal from the home 
said saturday that medical examinations of some children showed 
excessive use of corporal punishment 
as for the children who have returned to bethel since friday 
brittain said well work with the court on that and follow the 
courts direction on that 
there have been estimates that 120 to 160 children were at the 
home 
fountain refused to provide the court a list with names and 
addresses of the children and their parents 
fountain vowed saturday in a telephone interview from lucedale 
to continue to keep open bethels doors and said he had taken in 
another resident a teenage boy despite the judges friday order 
to tell you the truth i dont know how that court order 
reads he said 
charges that he enslaved and beat children are halftruths 
fountain said the children were brought to him precisely because 
they needed strong discipline and hard work to set them on a 
spiritual path 
the parents have lost control kids today are such 
manipulators such cons especially a child from a divorce theyve 
learned how to manipulate their parents the independent baptist 
minister said 
the children are here mainly for runaways stealing 
homosexuality we have little girls who were whores he said 
they need a little discipline a little bit of hard work we give 
them the bible not that trash they read not rock n roll they 
are going to do work when they are here 
fountain believes the state welfare department is in conspiracy 
against him a conspiracy that runs so deep those involved are 
unaware the conspiracy is based on the principles of humanism an 
anathema to his own fundamentalist beliefs and his advocacy of 
separation between church and state he claims 
the conspiracys aim he said is to set up licensing laws for 
churchrun homes something he insists he will never submit to

presidential candidate michael dukakis on 
sunday called president reagans antidrug programs chaos and 
promised the nations mayors a tough program to curb drug use and 
trafficking that would include the possible use of military force 
the massachusetts governor who has enough delegates to secure 
the democratic presidential nomination called for stronger drug 
laws and stringent sentencing guidelines but stopped short of 
endorsing capital punishment for major dealers which apparent 
republican nominee george bush supports 
my friends we can win the war against drugs dukakis said 
in a speech to the us conference of mayors where he picked up 
endorsements from more than 500 democratic mayors 
but we have to recognize that it is war a war of wills a 
war of values a war of confidence and courage and strength he 
said in his speech to the mayors 
dukakis also reiterated his pledge to raise taxes only as a last 
resort and told the mayors he welcomed their suggestions on 
potential running mates a lot of people are going to be 
considered he told reporters prior to the speech 
dukakis touted a massachusetts program that brings drug 
education to students and teachers and involves police and local 
celebrities promising to establish a similar national program if 
elected 
he said a national program should have the goal of ridding the 
nations schools of drugs by the 1990s and guaranteeing immediate 
treatment for addicts 
now some may say that goal is too ambitious that well never 
make it dukakis said but if we dont set ambitious goals for 
our young people and for our nation how are we ever going to win 
this war 
in a scathing indictment of reagans antidrug effort dukakis 
said the president has failed to back up his tough rhetoric and has 
undermined the war on drugs by cutting the coast guard budget by 
slashing federal aid to state and local police by failing to 
appoint a federal drug czar and by dealing with suspected drug 
runners particularly panamas gen manuel antonio noriega 
what we have today is chaos dukakis said weve got to 
back up what we say with what we do 
dukakis promised the mayors to beef up federal law enforcement 
staffs and to increase federal aid to state and local police 
although he did not suggest a specific dollar amount when asked by 
reporters 
he also said weve got to move the war against narcotics from 
the bottom to the top of our foreign policy agenda 
dukakis said that if elected he would issue an executive order 
prohibiting the payment of cia or other government funds to 
suspected drug dealers 
never again never again are you going to bankroll a drug 
peddler who is poisoning our society and killing are children 
dukakis said 
he also said he would use increased amounts of us foreign aid 
for crop eradication and other drug interdiction efforts including 
the protection of politicians police and judges in drugproducing 
countries whose lives are threatened by drug kingpins 
the military should be prepared to assist in such efforts said 
dukakis who again did not provide specific dollar figures on the

new breed of badmannered britons 
so the government worried about its hooligans abroad has 
launched a television advertising campaign aimed at salvaging the 
stiffupperlip image of its citizens overseas

british are going in vast numbers on holidays there are 
problems a foreign office spokesman explained sunday 
those problems include britons who wind up in trouble with the 
local law as well as crimes committed against british tourists 
those figures have gone up enormously the spokesman said 
anonymously in keeping with british practice 
british sports fans following their teams to games on the 
continent have run into serious trouble with police because of 
violence at soccer games british soccer clubs have been barred 
from european cup competition since 1985 
the foreign office decided to launch the summer advertising 
campaign in two weeks to back up its leaflet called get it right 
before you go 
it will urge travelers to take out proper insurance and remind 
them to abide by the laws of their host country during their stay

an examination of dozens of untended 
bodies found in a funeral home turned up at least one that dates 
back to 1978 authorities said 
the medical examiners office said saturday that it had 
identified 49 of 70 sets of remains discovered at the howell 
morning glory chapel which had the city contract for handling the 
bodies of indigents but chief medical examiner peter lipkovic said 
some may never be identified 
there will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not 
be able to identify them one doesnt have a head or legs so even 
if we had a dental chart what could we do he said 
the first two bodies were found during a routine state 
inspection and 42 more were found during last week many of them 
stacked in a closet a police officer said in addition 26 boxes 
containing cremated ashes were discovered 
bodies were identified through death certificates noting 
howells funeral home legible hospital bracelets medical 
examiners toe tags or medical appliances such as hip pins said 
lipkovic 
the oldest remains were identified through a 1978 death 
certificate lipkovic said 
officials have not released the names of those identified and 
have not contacted family members 
the state department of professional regulation suspended owner 
lewis howells license last week 
howell has said the bodies were being held because of procedural 
problems with paperwork not because of money problems 
howell was called sunday for additional comment but could not 
be reached 
officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard 
behind the funeral home but lipkovic doubts any bodies will be 
found with a free graveyard nearby that wouldnt make sense

terry waites family expressed optimism sunday 
that the church envoy will be freed by his lebanese captors despite 
a book claiming oliver north planned to use him in a death plot 
against libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
libya reacted to the report by saying it revealed the real 
ugly face of the reagan administration and it accused the united 
states of official terrorism 
david waite brother of the anglican church envoy called the 
allegations in the book mischievous 
but he added we are very optimistic about the eventual 
outcome of terrys situation the big question is the timing of it 
we are probably now in the most positive era we have ever been 
in as far as this situation is concerned we just have to wait 
and pray as we have been doing all along that we will eventually 
see a good outcome 
the book best laid plans the inside story of americas war 
against terrorism was written by david martin pentagon 
correspondent for cbs and john walcott national security 
correspondent for the wall street journal 
an excerpt printed in us news amp world report alleged that 
north a former us national security council aide planned to ask 
terry waite to go to tripoli to meet gadhafi in 1986 to seek help 
in freeing hostages in lebanon 
the article alleged that waites visit would be timed to ensure 
that gadhafi was in his compound when the americans launched their 
bombing raid on the libyan capital april 15 1986 according to the 
book the idea was to increase the chances of gadhafi being killed 
in the raid 
libyas official jana news agency in a dispatch monitored in 
london said the plot revealed today and the ones before it 
which included american official terrorism and subversion represent 
the style of smugglers and heads of gangsters 
it added every day the us administration reveals its real 
ugly face showing that america has become the official center of 
the administration of terrorism and subversive plots assassination 
and aggression against other peoples in a manner never seen before 
in contemporary political history 
the reagan administration ordered the bombings of tripoli and 
benghazi after accusing gadhafi of supporting international 
terrorism 
david waite said i think it is mischievous of people to put 
things like this the alleged north plot into books just to add a 
bit of spice to them 
they are talking about a person terry waite who is not in a 
position at the moment to defend himself he added 
waite said his brother always made it very clear he was not in 
any way associated with anything underhand or sinister 
he was and still is a humanitarian working for the archbishop 
of canterbury as an envoy on properly humanitarian grounds 
gadhafi was apparently unharmed in the bombing although there 
were rumors that the attack left him confused and disoriented 
libyan officials reported that his 15month old adopted daughter 
was killed and two young sons were wounded 
terry waite disappeared in beirut in january 1987 while on a 
mission to help win the release of foreign hostages in lebanon 
seventeen other foreigners including nine americans are being 
held captive by islamic extremists in lebanon the hostage held 
longest is terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was abducted march 16 1985 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel has retired from the 
military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from the 
diversion of profits to the nicaraguan rebels from us arms sales 
to iran he was fired from his nsc job in november 1986 when the 
diversion became public

a crowd of about 40 people most of them 
irishamerican tossed copies of golf digest into boston harbor on 
sunday in a tee party to protest slurs against the irish 
contained in a digest article 
the demonstration against the article the role of the irish 
at the country club took place about seven miles from the 
country club site of the 1988 us open golf championship this 
week 
the article by british writer peter dobereiner enraged 
irishamericans boston mayor raymond flynn and cardinal bernard 
law among others for its depiction of irish as lazy drunkards 
the furor was intensified when the boston sunday globe reprinted 
the piece as an advertising supplement in some 250000 copies of 
the paper when the controversy erupted late last week the 
newspaper issued an apology but said it was too late to withdraw 
the special inserts 
in addition the globe printed an apology on page 3 of the 
sunday paper and golf digest apologized in an advertisment in the 
globe sports section last week arthur ochs sulzberger president 
of the new york times co parent company of golf digest sent 
flynn a written apology 
the article quoted a fictitious member of the 106yearold club 
in the 1880s as saying its getting so you cant walk around 
boston without tripping over a drunken kerryman if we are to 
preserve our way of life we must have somewhere to go on weekends 
with a high fence to keep the irish out 
the article was apparently intended as humor and written 
satirically from the perspective of a historical scholar it 
contained absurdities about the irish role in building the country 
club such as this 
of course they had to employ irish laborers to do the heavy 
work but they employed an english construction superintendent who 
contracted laryngitis from constantly shouting green side up 
while the workers were sodding the golf course 
the protesters gathered sunday on castle island a peninsula off 
the predominantly irishamerican neighborhood of south boston and 
threw about 20 copies of golf digest into the harbor they also 
called for the united states golf association to ban dobereiner 
from the grounds of the open 
the magazines were later retrieved so as not to litter the 
harbor 
we have a right to expect that the globe would not showcase an 
article that was blatantly racist said kieran staunton boston 
editor of the irish voice a weekly newspaper that first drew 
attention to the article 
globe spokesman richard gulla said sunday retrieving all copies 
of the ad would have been impossible because it was contained in a 
section of the paper delivered a week in advance to retail stores 
and distributors those sections are later sold along with the news 
pages 
an unspecified number of copies of the offending advertisement 
were retrieved he said 
only 250000 of the globes 800000 sunday papers included the 
article because golf digest wanted to reach a targeted audience 
gulla said

their daughter was growing weaker in the heat 
university officials put up the family at least for one night 
in adjacent rooms of a dormitory

president francois mitterrands socialists failed 
to win a majority in sundays national assembly elections and must 
form a coalition or attempt to govern with a minority 
with returns lacking only from territories in the caribbean and 
south pacific the socialists and the conservative parties were in 
a near dead heat but only the socialists were in a position to 
form a governing coalition in the 577seat assembly 
at least 289 seats are needed for a majority 
with nine districts still undecided the socialists won 272 
seats and the communists 26 
the conservative rally for the republic won 126 seats the 
centerright union for french democracy 129 and minor rightists 14 
for a total of 269 
the extremeright national front won one seat its leader 
jeanmarie le pen was defeated in marseille 
mitterrand could form a coalition with the communists or try to 
lure centrists away from the rightist camp 
francois mitterrand does not have a majority therefore we 
won declared jacques toubon secretarygeneral of the rally for 
the republic the ball is in his camp it is up to him to manage 
his defeat 
but pierre mauroy first secretary of the socialist party said 
the right is beaten it will not win a majority of seats only 
the socialist party is in a position to constitute a parliamentary 
majority 
georges marchais secretarygeneral of the communist party said 
it was out of the question that his party would participate in a 
socialist government he said the communists would support bills it 
approved and fight everything that goes against its interests 
jean lecanuet president of the union for french democracy did 
not say whether any of his centrist forces would be prepared to 
participate in a coalition with the socialists 
personally i hope that the french get a government made up of 
the best he said i wonder if the time has not come for 
national union 
valery giscard destaing former centerright president said 
the results showed the french did not want one party to have all 
the power 
that is a good thing they tried to say we want the two 
halves of france to work together he said 
only 122 of the seats in the national assembly the most 
powerful house of parliament were filled in the first round of the 
election june 5 
sundays runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate 
won a majority the first time a first round of voting also was 
held for two seats from french polynesia 
voter turnout was estimated at 71 percent according to the 
interior ministry 
since 1986 when the conservatives won control of the national 
assembly mitterrand has been forced into an uncomfortable 
cohabitation with the right 
following his reelection last month with a 54 percent of the 
vote mitterrand dissolved the assembly and called elections three 
years early to win a majority 
in the first round the two main conservative parties won 77 
seats the socialists 40 the minor rightist parties four and the 
communists one 
preelection polls predicted a large socialist majority in the 
national assembly but the conservatives received more votes in 
round one 
the socialists and communists concluded a secondround agreement 
in which both parties supported the leading leftist candidate in 
each district and withdrew the weaker candidate to prevent 
splitting the vote 
guy hermier a member of the communist party politburo 
reiterated that communist support for socialist candidates in some 
districts did not mean approval of socialist policies 
we will judge them by their acts said hermier 
the two main conservative parties already backed a single 
candidate but in the few districts in which a farright national 
front candidate was leading the traditional rightist candidate 
withdrew and vice versa 
the main conservative parties denied there was any deal with the 
national front accused by most politicians of being racist and 
xenophobic 
mitterrand said recently that it was unhealthy for the country 
to be run by one party alone but his effort to open his government 
to nonsocialists largely failed 
candidates on the right also spoke of ending the traditional 
rightleft confrontation

a proposed major presbyterian statement on 
nuclear war was revised sunday to say a christian normally 
should support the government and nuclear deterrence is immoral 
as an end in inself 
a writing team working over the weekend on christian obedience 
in a nuclear age made the changes which a subcommittee then 
adopted 
the changes will be presented to a full committee monday and 
the 200th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa is 
scheduled to take up the paper tuesday 
also on the agenda when 630 delegates of the nations largest 
presbyterian body return to work monday are the election of a top 
denominational officer and a host of other issues including 
pornography israels treatment of palestinians in occupied 
territories and religious freedom 
the subcommittee of 18 people including lay clergy youth and 
seminary advisory delegates generally adopted the work of the 
writing committee sunday 
the writing panel had been charged with making the papers 
policy statement and background agree with the revised 
recommendations made by the subcommittee earlier 
those changes included removing language that would strengthen 
corporate church support for tax resisters and other government 
protesters and soften language declaring nuclear deterrence immoral 
the changes shifted some words to play down discussion of tax 
resistance and added language saying christian obedience to civil 
authority is normally the case 
a paragraph was also added recognizing military service as a 
legitimate christian response 
the revised policy statement also retains condemnation of 
nuclear war as immoral but the original declaration of nuclear 
deterrence as being immoral was altered to add the phrase as an 
end in itself 
the proposed policy statement now says the policy of nuclear 
deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in itself rather 
than an interim measure of selfdefense such a policy as an end in 
itself is not morally defensible the work for peaceful 
alternatives needs to be vigorously pursued 
supporters of the initial paper said they expect the full 
assembly committee on peacemaking and international relations to 
restore some of the original language 
while opponents of the paper agreed that was possible 
whatever they do to the document it needs to be sent for 
prayerful consideration by the church instead of adopted as a 
policy said john boone president of presbyterians for democracy 
and religious freedom 
a nominating committees decision not to include an incumbent as 
a candidate for a top denominational office caught the assembly by 
surprise saturday afternoon there were indications commissioners 
would face a contested election when they vote tuesday 
the rev james e andrews 60 has been stated clerk or interim 
costated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by 
the reunion of the northern and southern branches of the 
presbyterian church previously he held the same office in the 
presbyterian church us the southern church for 10 years 
the committee nominated harriet nelson a popular former 
moderator or chief spokesman for the 62000ayear job 
andrews has said his name will be placed in nomination from the 
assembly floor when voting begins in addition the rev charles e 
hurst a local church executive from pompano beach fla will be 
nominated from the floor 
other committee recommendations include a call for israel to end 
its 20year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip with the 
united states asked to stop sending aid which is used to subsidize 
israeli settlement of the territories

and around a church applauded vatican demands sunday that the 
communist government permit more roman catholic bishops and priests

former soldiers loyal to deposed 
president ferdinand marcos raided a military armory in a failed 
attempt to free colleagues jailed for past coup attempts the 
military said 
maj gen ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary 
said the group got away with 24 automatic rifles in their saturday 
attack montano said they had intended to free orlando dulay a 
former army colonel provincial governor and assemblyman who was 
close to marcos when he was president 
dulay has been jailed at suburban camp crame for more than a 
year on charges he ordered the killing of several supporters of 
president corazon aquino during the 1986 presidential election that 
ended marcos 20year reign 
the military also announced that it filed murder and kidnapping 
charges against a swede a west german and a filipino of german 
descent who were arrested in a rebelinfested area on wednesday 
they were accused of taking part in a raid by communist new 
peoples army guerrillas on a town southeast of manila in february 
two people were killed and two soldiers were abducted in the raid 
also saturday a swiss judge ruled that assets held by marcos in 
switzerland must be returned to his homeland no figures were 
given but the assets involved were believed to be a small part of 
the 1 billion that philippine officials believe marcos channeled 
into swiss bank accounts before he fled to exile in hawaii 
marcos who was living in honolulu said saturday that he was 
leaving the possibility of an appeal to his lawyers 
the raid occurred at camp crame the constabularys national 
headquarters most of the 160 detainees there are soldiers accused 
of common crimes but at least 34 of them are accused of taking 
part in coup attempts against mrs aquino 
montano said troops were prepared for the raid because of 
intelligence reports earlier that marcos loyalists would try to 
free dulay he did not elaborate 
he said the raiders broke into one office of the armory and 
stole some weapons then sped toward the jail compound in a van and 
a car but were fired on by sentries who spotted them 
the raiders immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief 
gunfight by other soldiers near the camps gym montano said 
lt col cris maralit a constabulary spokesman said some of 
the raiders were believed hit in the exchange but no casualty 
figures given 
a few hours later troops were placed on maximum alert 
nationwide but officials said the move was not related to the camp 
crame incident 
they said the alert was a routine measure to prevent disruption 
of sundays celebration of the 90th anniversary of the declaration 
of philippine independence from spain 
late saturday the army chief of staff gen renato de villa 
described the camp crame incident as an isolated one meant to 
embarrass the government two days before mrs aquino departs for 
visits to switzerland and italy 
we would like to appeal to our people not to be disturbed by 
what happened at camp crame he told reporters i am very 
confident that our commanders who are tasked to protect public 
safety will be able to do their job 
brig gen alejandro galido chief of the militarys southern 
luzon command said in a telephone interview that murder and 
kidnapping charges against two europeans and a filipino were filed 
friday before a civil court in quezon province 
he claimed his command had heavy evidence against the rev 
klaus schmidt 52 a west german protestant minister stellan 
hermansson 30 a swede who says he is a freelance journalist and 
antonio bosch a filipino businessman 
swedens young communist league said friday in stockholm that 
hermansson was the organizations president it said he arrived in 
the philippines on may 18 to gather information for lectures and 
was to have returned to sweden saturday 
hermansson and the two others were being held at the command 
headquarters in lucena 60 miles southeast of manila 
col hernani figueroa said the charges stem from a new peoples 
army raid on the quezon province town of san francisco last 
february in which two police officers were killed and two soldiers 
abducted 
the soldiers who eventually escaped identified schmidt 
hermansson and bosch as being with the san francisco raiders 
figueroa said 
hermansson denied the charges said eha arg first secretary of 
the swedish embassy he visited hermansson on saturday 
he hermansson denies the charges because he was not in the 
country in february ms arg said in a telephone interview 
a west german embassy officer visited schmidt but could not be 
contacted for comment because the mission was closed on the weekend 
the military has accused the three of helping train communist 
guerrillas

seventeen years after it first opened in new 
york godspell has come home with its simplicity good humor 
and joyous sense of wonder intact 
the production which arrived sunday at the lambs theater is 
not so much a revival as a repolishing of the original material 
while adding bits and pieces from todays follies and foibles to 
bring it up to date ronald reagan is here so are jim and tammy 
bakker even pee wee herman gets into the act although he and the 
other names from current events are not the essential part of the 
story 
the musical remains a carefully crafted piece of street theater 
that seeks to instruct if not convert the book devised by 
johnmichael tebelak follows the gospel according to st matthew 
reinterpreting the live of jesus as well as the parables he told 
tebelaks jesus is a clown a harlequin with a heart painted on 
his forehead and a big red superman s on his chest hes a 
teacher and his lessons come right from matthews version of the 
bible he reinterprets many of the most famous parables such as the 
prodigal son 
that reinterpretation is accomplished through a series of 
vaudeville turns directed with a sure sense of style and wit by don 
scardino theres low comedy high camp and just about every type 
of dumb joke in between but the concoction works primarily 
because of scardinos inventiveness and the exuberant score most 
of it written by stephen schwartz 
godspell remains the composers most beguiling work 
schwartz later went on to write such musicals as pippin the 
magic show and the bakers wife but it is in his first show 
that he found the best inspiration from an anthem like prepare 
ye the way of the lord to an obvious uptempo show stopper like 
we beseech thee schwartz tailored his music to a young 
enthusiastic cast and still managed to produce one song day by 
day which found a life outside the musical 
its been fashionable to dismiss godspell for its naivete 
and simplemindedness but this revival contains some surprising 
moments of power particularly at the end of the evening when jesus 
is betrayed by judas 
the scene is memorable for a fine bit of acting by jeffrey 
steefel as the street version of the messiah and robert mcneill as 
his betrayer but then the entire cast exudes a precision and 
passion uncommon in most revivals they are among some of the best 
young musical comedy talent around 
the others include laura dean a bewitching seductress anne 
bobby a sweetfaced singer trini alvarado a striking woman with 
a low sexy voice bill damaschke a goofy likable performer 
angel jemmott a fine comedian and a belter as well eddie korbich 
a real songanddance hoofer mia korf who manages to make day 
by day sound fresh and harold perrineau jr a sturdy soul 
singer 
the scenery by allison campbell is a generic street scene while 
the costumes by david c woolard are thriftshop eccentric making 
up in color what they lack in high fashion 
but this resurrection of godspell has plenty of style high 
spirits and sense of fun which make it impossible to resist it 
should win plenty of new converts

democrats agreed sunday that their 
platform must brand south africa a terrorist state but bickered 
over whether to call for a freeze in pentagon spending 
winding up a long weekend at this quaint resort the democrats 
platform drafting committee sidestepped the question of the federal 
budget deficit and whether to call for higher taxes on the rich as 
jesse jackson wants 
the 16member drafting committee left that and other issues that 
separate the michael dukakis and jackson camps for another day it 
took no votes but will meet again sometime before the full 
186member platform committee convenes in denver june 2526 
before adjourning the democrats released working papers on 10 
issues hashed out behind the scenes by the committee staff and 
dukakis and jackson campaign officials these briefs call for 
appointment of a federal drug czar adoption of the equal rights 
amendment ending homelessness expanding aids research and 
providing advance notice of plant closings 
i found more areas of agreement that disagreement rep 
william gray iii of pennsylvania the drafting panels chairman 
said after wrapping up the threeday meeting 
those who hoped for blood will find the floor is clean said 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief but significant 
gaps remained between the dukakis and jackson stances on taxes 
defense and foreign policy that could be fought out in denver or on 
the convention floor next month in atlanta 
there was no argument though over the jackson campaigns 
insistence that the platform denounce south africa as a terrorist 
state 
rep robert matsui a dukakis backer from california said we 
have no problem calling south africa a terrorist state but lets 
go beyond that 
madeleine albright dukakiss foreign policy adviser said the 
massachusetts governor favors passage of the tougher sanctions in 
the dellumswolpe bill that would give the secretary of state 60 
days to decide whether to put south africa on a list of terrorist 
nations with libya and iran 
divisions among the platform drafters quickly resurfaced when 
the discussion turned to freezing the pentagon budget and whether 
the united states should renounce any first use of nuclear weapons 
two aflcio leaders on the panel counseled against too dovish a 
stance 
rachelle horowitz political director of the american federation 
of teachers said the democrats must root out waste in the 
pentagon but also honor our treaty obligations and defend 
democratic institutions and our freedoms i hope this platform will 
call for a stable defense budget and not for any specific freezes 
or cuts 
leslie mclemore a political science professor and jackson 
stalwart from jackson state university in mississippi replied 
the defense budget is not a sacred cow i wish to see congress 
persons and commissioners and judges and everybody run on this 
platform and feel comfortable with it but we cannot dupe the 
american people 
as democrats we owe the country a serious look at freezing 
and cutting that defense budget and shifting those funds to 
social programs mclemore said i really dont think we can get 
out of the maze by saying to the american people that well deal 
with it in the sweet by and by 
matsui defended the notion of a stable defense budget saying 
you just cant say were going to pull out of korea or pull out 
of western europe in the next 12 or 24 months 
and when mclemore urged the party to join the roman catholic 
bishops in renouncing any intention of using nuclear weapons james 
b booe the secretarytreasurer of the communications workers of 
america rose to the defense of deterrence 
over 40 years of negotiating with a lot of people ill 
tell you i dont tell any adversary for sure im not going to do 
anything from a bargaining standpoint from a diplomatic 
standpoint i want to keep them off balance booe said 
another jackson delegate janice thurmond an athens ga 
lawyer urged that the platform embrace jacksons middle east views 
on selfdetermination for the palestinians but there was no reply 
by the dukakis forces 
but albright told reporters flatly that the platform will not 
contain language that jackson wants endorsing selfdetermination 
for the palestinian people 
the working paper on defense and foreign policy as well as one 
on government and voting reforms will be written later and 
distributed to the drafting committee before its second meeting 
which gray said may be held june 24 in denver on the eve of the 
full panels session 
michael barnes dukakis chief platform representative said 
there are differences and the differences are important but he 
predicted we are going to leave atlanta united and determined 
to win that election in november 
barnes told reporters we are not seeking floor fights he 
said jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight on any 
issue he chooses but dukakis will have a large enough majority to 
prevail

it may look more like a coffee klatch 
than researchers hard at work on a new product but thats the 
whole idea 
the concept of group decisionmaking triggered by spontaneous 
encounters is shaping the design of a 75 million research and 
development center being built at steelcase inc the worlds 
leading designer and manufacturer of office furniture 
not only does the new sevenstory pyramidshaped building 
represent a shift in steelcases own corporate culture the company 
also hopes to market the concept of group creativeness to its 
customers 
buying new furniture and computers wont get people to be more 
productive company spokesman peter jeff said customers are 
coming to us with a larger agenda they want to understand how they 
can work better and how their people can work better 
but before we can be the office environment company for anyone 
else we have to be it for ourselves 
though teamwork and spontaneous meetings are nothing new its 
unusual for a company of steelcases size to tinker with success 
the 76yearold company had about 15 billion in sales last year 
it controls about a quarter of the office furniture market 
according to anne fallucchi editor and copublisher of facilities 
design and management a new york citybased trade magazine 
the new corporate development center is architecturally designed 
to foster communication among all levels of the organization 
putting in practice the theory that spontaneous interaction is the 
best catalyst for creativeness about 400 of the 8000 workers the 
company employs in grand rapids will be moved into the building 
just south of its headquarters early next year 
were trying to provide as many opportunities as we can in 
this building for people to run into one another said wayne d 
veneklasen organizational environmental psychologist for steelcase 
research shows that 80 percent of professionals ideas come 
from facetoface communication 
to encourage that kind of spontaneity there are few barriers in 
the building escalators are used instead of elevators people 
never talk on elevators veneklasen said and four entrances to 
the building feed into a central meeting place or town square 
in the atrium 
using what designers have dubbed the cave and commons 
approach each employee will have his or her own private space or 
cave but in the middle of a circle of caves will be the 
groups commons area also dubbed interaction nodes for group 
meetings each of these areas will be equipped with a coffee and 
soft drink bar and a marker board for when the conversation turns 
to product ideas 
we know that people are going to talk about the stupid 
neighbors dog that kept them up all night long and theyre going 
to diagram football plays but theyre also going to talk about 
product ideas veneklasen said 
if one product idea comes out of only one of those coffee 
areas theyve paid for themselves for the life of the building 
given our manufacturing abilities veneklasen said 
executives will be in the directors cluster a ring of private 
offices in the middle of the building for the lone rangers 
there will be small offices without telephones or other potential 
distractions veneklasen said 
there will be terraces with outdoor work areas and a fitness 
trail prairie grass will replace the traditional grass and shrubs 
the company will be structured not by departments as it is now 
but by projects all the people involved in a project whether they 
be in the engineering marketing or design departments will be 
grouped together 
at most companies the process of developing a product is 
usually linear like a relay race where the person does his part 
and passes it on to the next person veneklasen said 
were taking the rugby team approach the designers the 
engineers the manufacturing people the marketing people and the 
corporate communications people will pass the ball back and 
forth but all going in the same direction at the same time 
the 573000foot building will feature stateoftheart 
laboratories for perfecting the office environment including 
research on office acoustics lighting and temperature control 
steelcase has said the center will serve as a springboard for 
its future plans to add 8000 employees to its worldwide work 
force of 17500 by the turn of the century 
it sees the consulting service as a natural extension of its 
existing business where single chairs carry price tags of up to 
900 and big orders for major companies can run into the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars jeff says steelcase plans no extra charge 
to customers for its logistical advice 
indeed such consulting is fast becoming a popular addition to 
the industrys sales pitch 
its not just a question of putting in a desk and a couple of 
file cabinets anymore said simon de groot communications 
director for national office products association in alexandria 
va the aim now is to create an environment that allows office 
workers to take full advantage of new technology and be as 
productive as possible 
but when it comes to advising clients is steelcases open style 
for everyone some researchers say the concept of group 
creativeness at the heart of japanese industry may not work in a 
society where individualism is king 
its like changing somebodys religion said william k 
redmon an assistant professor at western michigan who has been 
studying how well us companies are adjusting to japanese work 
practices 
even for steelcase the team approach may make some managers 
uncomfortable 
its going to take time for everybody to get used to it

a study commissioned by the mexican government 
says mexico should strengthen its ties to the us automobile 
industry by making it easier to export cars assembled in mexico and 
by upgrading its auto parts industry according to a report 
published sunday 
the detroit news which obtained the study said it notes that a 
closer alliance between the two nations auto industries might 
develop only if mexico distinguished itself from japan south korea 
and other nations competing in the market 
the study conducted by the consulting firm boozallen amp 
hamilton inc was commissioned last year by the mexican government 
and the bank of mexico as part of efforts to obtain world bank 
loans for industrial restructuring 
the mexican government must differentiate mexico from other 
countries brazil taiwan korea and japan in the eyes of the us 
congress and the us public stressing proximity cultural ties 
common problems and the long period of constructive 
relationships the study said 
if us protectionism grows and mexico is lumped together with 
japan and korea in retaliatory us trade legislation all of the 
recommendations in this report are moot it said 
the study estimated that salaried auto workers in mexico are 
paid 20 percent to 25 percent of what their us counterparts 
receive 
the study argued that the lower costs were part of mexican 
economic advantages within a north american auto production system 
that saves jobs for us workers 
without access to mexico to selectively provide lowcost 
labor as part of the overall process more vehicles and parts 
would be obtained from brazil and various far east countries with 
the consequent loss of both us and mexican jobs the study said 
boozallen recommended that mexico immediately upgrade its auto 
partsmaking industy which accounted for more than half of that 
nations 900 million auto exports trade surplus in 1986 
the study also called for easing regulations on companies 
already assembling cars in mexico to encourage more exports to the 
us it also recommended that mexico establish a technical center 
in detroit to keep pace with technological developments 
the big three us automakers each have assembly engine and 
parts plants in mexico chrysler corp and general motors corp 
spokesmen said they were unaware of plans to increase investments 
there a ford motor co spokesman said company doesnt discuss 
possible investments 
boozallen said mexico would have to convince the united auto 
workers union that an automotive alliance would benefit both 
countries 
but uaw secretarytreasurer bill casstevens said the union 
remained opposed to mexican auto investments that he said exploited 
workers there and caused the loss of us jobs 
if the mexicans develop a more competitive industry it will 
mean the loss of more jobs he told the news

the successful farmer of the future may 
be the one who pays the closest attention to the futures say a new 
breed of computerized farmers who deal directly with the nations 
commodities exchanges 
clyde hagemann 44 who grows soybeans and corn and fattens 
feeder cattle on his familys 1800acre farm near this kane county 
community is typical of the new breed 
although hagemann wears a soiled cap from a fertilizer company 
he doesnt resort to the marketing strategies many other farmers in 
his area still use instead of delivering his corn and beans to the 
local elevator every year and selling them through a forward 
contract hagemann sells his crops and cattle months in advance in 
complex contracts directly on the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
hagemanns computer and his constant electronic display of 
commodity price quotes are as important to his farming as his 
combine and his corn dryer 
experts say that by using the futures exchanges to market their 
products farmers can obtain price stability particularly in 
volatile markets like the one being driven by the current drought 
along with marketing versatility and they can maximize profits 
hagemann told the chicago tribune recently that he has been 
dealing directly with the exchanges for 20 years which makes him 
something of a pioneer in the process used by only 10 to 15 
percent of the nations farmers 
farm experts commodities brokers and farm economy consultants 
say farmers who learn the new marketing techniques have a definite 
advantage over their more traditionbound neighbors 
the family farm is romantic history says consultant dan 
markey who conducts marketing seminars for farmers throughout the 
nation farmers must use modern business tools if they are to 
survive and that specifically includes the use of futures and 
options 
another farmer who hedges by selling and buying futures and 
options contracts is robert b johnson 44 who operates a 
3000acre corn soybean and hog farm east of de kalb johnson who 
studied the marketing techniques at a local junior college says he 
doesnt understand the attitude of other farmers who staged 
demonstrations outside the board of trade some years back to 
protest what they believed was price manipulation 
the speculator does not set the price of the commodity rather 
the market sets the price says johnson 
nonetheless johnson and others advise them to make a serious 
study of marketing techniques before attempting to use them 
you cannot get too close to the market particularly during 
these times of extreme price volatility warns computerized 
shabbona farmer rob mullins 23 a lot of farmers come in here 
and just watch the quotes as they come across the screen when they 
should be out watching their crops

texaco inc and its biggest shareholder carl c 
icahn may be headed for a showdown this week that could determine 
the course of their acrimonious takeover dispute 
icahn is waging a proxy fight for five seats on the 14member 
texaco board in an effort to pressure the oil giant to let 
shareholders vote on his 60ashare offer for the 852 percent of 
texaco stock that he does not already own 
the bid values the entire company at 146 billion 
the deadline for the proxy votes on the board seats is friday 
when texaco plans to hold its annual shareholders meeting in tulsa 
okla 
texaco which is based in white plains ny has rejected 
icahns buyout proposal and has questioned his ability to finance 
it 
wall street has also been skeptical about the offer texaco 
finished last week at 5187 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
but icahn has said he is so certain he could arrange the 
financing that he says he would put 300 million in escrow for 
payment to shareholders if he failed to arrange it by the date of 
the shareholder vote on the offer 
meanwhile a published report over the weekend said court 
documents show an investment firm that has a large stake in texaco 
considered selling its stake and icahn once tried to bring in 
canadian investor marc belzberg to buy it 
the new york times reported that the court papers indicate the 
deal never took place however because the parties could not agree 
on a price 
the times said its report on saturday was based on documents 
unsealed at the newspapers request by judge gerard l goettel of 
us district court in white plains who had earlier denied access 
to depositions taken in suits between icahn and texaco related to 
icahns takeover effort 
the times story said that alan c greenberg the chairman of 
bears stearns amp co a brokerage house that bought stock for the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co said in a 
deposition that icahn once considered selling his shares to the 
buyout firm 
the newspaper said greenberg was acting as a gobetween and in 
several proposed transactions the buyer and seller were unaware of 
each others identities 
it said greenberg did not identify belzberg in his deposition 
but that a bears stearns lawyer did later it said the deposition 
makes clear that icahn and not greenberg recruited belzberg as a 
potential buyer 
the newspaper said greenbergs deposition indicates the 
transaction never took place because the parties could not agree on 
a price 
on friday icahn said he was forming a new holding company to 
act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions including a possible 
hostile takeover bid for texaco he said the holding company 
intended to raise up to 325 billion through an offering of stock 
and debt securities 
the icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the 
holding company including its 361 million shares of texaco and 
its interests in trans world airlines inc and acf a leasing 
company 
icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the 
texaco board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer he 
would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding 
company at yet to be determined terms
