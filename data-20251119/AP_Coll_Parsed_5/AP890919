organizations formed after the 1985 earthquake 
that killed more than 10000 people marked the anniversary of the 
disaster with antigovernment demonstrations and memorial services 
tuesday 
about 250 people from the sept 19 seamstresses union attended a 
mass and then briefly blocked busy san antonio abad street where 
hundreds perished in garment factories that collapsed during the 
quake about 50 riot police forced the demonstrators back to the 
sidewalk allowing morning rushhour traffic to resume 
several groups placed flowers at solidarity plaza where a hotel 
burned in the quake residents of the tlatelolco housing complex 
attended a mass at 719 am the time the quake collapsed two of 
the three sections of a 14story apartment building 
organizations demanding housing for the homeless made a 20block 
march to the zocalo the capitals main plaza where an estimated 
12000 people gathered for a rally 
there are more than 2000 homeless families still living in 
temporary camps in the cuahtemoc borough alejandro varas one of 
the protest organizaers said in an interview 
he said there are about 1500 housing units promised by the 
government that havent been turned over to the quake victims 
there is open corruption in the delivery we demand cleanliness in 
the distribution of housing varas said 
president carlos salinas de gortari raised the flag to halfstaff 
in the zocalo earlier tuesday observed a minute of silence and 
dedicated a new government hospital that replaced a 12story 
building that fell 
he said the new juarez hospital comes out of the tragedy of the 
september 1985 earthquakes it is in essence a memorial to those 
who died and at the same time shows us that mexicans can convert 
adversity into regeneration and above all permanently maintain the 
solidarity in benefit of all our countrymen 
the destroyed hospital was one of two where 19 babies survived in 
the rubble for from eight hours to nearly nine days before they were 
rescued 
dehydrated and covered with infected wounds when they were found 
the miracle babies today are active 4yearolds 
the government said 6000 people perished in the earthquake and 
an aftershock the next day others have placed the death toll as 
high as 32000 
more than 400 buildings in mexico city with a population of 18 
million were destroyed and 5700 damaged according to the 
government 
the sept 19 seamstresses union and the organizations for the 
homeless were among groups that were organized after the quake many 
have developed into permanent activist groups 
in july 1988 leftist political parties with the support of many 
of the groups made their strongest showing in a mexican presidential 
election holding salinas to just over 50 percent of the vote

islanders boarded up their homes and 
bought supplies tuesday as hurricane hugo blamed in at least 25 
deaths swept along the bahamas after leaving an estimated 50000 
people homeless in the eastern caribbean 
weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the 
british colony of turks and caicos islands southeast of the bahamas 
chain on tuesday night the storm was moving on a parallel course 
east of the bahamas 
all of the islands at some time or another are going to get 
some effects from hugo said noel risnychok specialist with the 
national hurricane center in coral gables fla 
weather officials in the bahamas feared hugo could drift westward 
toward more populated islands including new providence 
that island which includes the bahamas capital city of nassau 
is the most populated with an estimated 135000 people 
the government of the bahamas tuesday downgraded the hurricane 
watch for the central bahamas to a tropical storm warning a 
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern bahamas 
though it was discontinued for the turks and caicos islands 
at 1030 pm edt tuesday the hurricanes center was near 
latitude 238 degrees north and longitude 695 west about 190 miles 
east northeast of grand turk island in the southern bahamas 
according to the national weather service 
hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles 
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph 
government officials in nassau were monitoring the hurricane but 
had not made any special preparations tuesday for hugo said bill 
kalis press secretary for the governments information office 
residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go 
about their daily businesses he said 
they were telling everybody to get the water the lamps 
handy said dorothea seymour of naussau who has a stall at the 
straw market on bay street we never had a storm here for some 
years were always hearing about storms but they never come 
some people worry some people dont she said 
although the indications are that its going to move east of 
the more populated areas no one is relaxing their vigil because it 
can change direction kalis said 
kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation 
the stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as 
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows he said 
weather officials in the bahamas said hugos threat to the 
northwestern bahamas has intensified because of the 
westnorthwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take 
this westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern 
bahamas which includes the bulk of the population said ken 
lightbourne chief meteorological officer for the governments 
weather agency in nassau 
officials with paradise island airlines in fort lauderdale fla 
said they had not changed flight schedules yet but were monitoring 
the hurricanes path 
were just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else 
said hugh riesdorph director of flight operations for the airlines 
he said the company makes 11 roundtrip flights daily from fort 
lauderdale and miami to paradise island which is linked by a bridge 
to nassau

vice president dan quayle stopped in 
alaska on monday and reassured officials that cleanup work is not 
over on the oilsmeared beaches of prince william sound 
the job is not complete quayle said during a brief refueling 
stop en route to korea japan and the philippines you have our 
assurance that we will stay until the job is complete 
quayle was referring to the coast guards role as federal 
coordinator in valdez coast guard commandant paul yost has been 
monitoring exxons cleanup work since three weeks after the march 24 
wreck of the tanker exxon valdez 
the tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into prince 
william sound after slamming into a reef resulting in the nations 
worst oil spill 
exxon declared its summer cleanup finished on friday the company 
said dwindling sunlight and deteriorating weather made further work 
this year unsafe 
quayles visit came as president bush visited the northwest in a 
swing through south dakota montana and washington bush defended 
his decision not to travel to alaska saying he had sent his 
environmental vice president 
during his visit quayle spent about a halfhour with alaskas 
oiled mayors the mayors of five coastal communities where 
crude continues to wash up on shore and where fishing fleets 
generally were tied up for the summer 
last may quayle inspected the oil spill cleanup on smith island 
quayle said monday it would not surprise him to learn that parts of 
the island among the first and hardest hit by the spill remain 
oily months after cleanup began 
the alaska mayors apparently won no new promises of action from 
the administration 
but kodiak mayor robert b brodie said quayle seemed to listen to 
the mayors concerns about the federal cleanup role next spring 
we told him the spills not over just because exxon has 
completed work and gone brodie said 
the vice president also met briefly with driftnet fishermen who 
are concerned about the bush administrations new agreement aimed at 
restricting driftnet fleets from taiwan korea and japan from 
fishing the north pacific ocean for squid 
us fishermen oppose the use of driftnets by foreign fleets 
because they contend the lightweight nets illegally harvest 
thousands of tons of salmon and steelhead

court proceedings were instituted 
against the leader of the southwest africa peoples organization by 
a group seeking information about hundreds of people the guerrilla 
movement allegedly detained 
swapo president sam nujoma who returned last week after 30 years 
in exile was served with court papers monday by a deputy sheriff 
following the legal move by the parents committee of namibia 
the committee alleged that swapo has failed to account for about 
1400 people who were put to work at guerrilla bases in angola 
during the movements 23year bush war against south african rule in 
neighboring namibia 
south africa has agreed to grant the territory independence and 
swapo is favored to win unsupervised elections in november for an 
assembly that will draft a constitution 
swapo contends that it complied with the un independence plan 
by releasing all prisoners in its custody 
but the parents committee in documents filed with the 
territorial supreme court claimed 1400 people either remain in 
swapo prison camps or have disappeared the committee called on 
swapo to account for the whereabouts of the missing people 
a un delegation is due back in namibia soon after a trip to 
angola and zambia to determine whether any prisoners are at swapo 
camps 
according to freed detainees hundreds of swapo members were 
accused of being south african spies and many were tortured until 
they signed confessions swapo leaders have confirmed incidents of 
torture and have countered that the south africanled security 
forces also were guilty of brutality

berrypickers in the soviet far north gathered ten 
times as many blueberries and cranberries this year after a 
swedishsoviet firm offered to pay them with foreign fashions and 
consumer electronics tass says 
the soviet news agency reported mondya that cooperatives in the 
murmansk area gathered 100 tons of blueberries and 500 tons of 
cowberries a type of tundra cranberry for a swedishsoviet joint 
venture called artikfryuz 
that is ten times the amount they collected in their most 
productive years 
soviet stores are nearly empty particularly in provincial towns 
like murmansk the few goods often are allocated by privilege so 
soviet workers paid in rubles can find themselves with nothing to 
buy 
soviet citizens are not allowed to hold foreign currency and the 
handful who work for foreign firms receive a fraction of their pay 
in credit at hard currency stores 
the tass story was the first to indicate that foreign firms might 
be able to pay soviets directly with imported consumer goods 
the soviet government also has started an experiment that will 
pay grain farmers in hard currency for producing extra wheat in 
hopes of cutting the amount they now import at higher worldmarket 
prices

an heiress who considered residents of 
this resort town her family worried that the tourist wealth wasnt 
reaching them so when she died she left an estate of 800000 to 
help each child go to college 
when celia francis graduated from provincetown high school in 
1921 she was herself a recipient of a scholarship francis 
reportedly was criticized for taking the money because her family 
was wealthly and some say she left her fortune to ease the sting of 
those remarks 
francis used the money to attend boston university and went on to 
become a government lawyer she returned home in the 1950s to be 
with her mother and brother who were all that remained of her 
immediate family 
but soon after her arrival both died suddenly within two months 
of each other francis who was unmarried was left with a 
substantial inheritance from her fathers and brothers real estate 
business much of it was made supplying housing to the artists and 
writers who made up the first wave of tourists here 
alone she took on the provincetown community as her new family 
said margaret roberts a close friend 
she always kept her eye on what was happening in the town 
said roberts on friday she kept in contact with her friends 
through an address book she put down their names and their 
childrens names where they went to school and it was whole 
family trees 
provincetown at the farthest end of cape cod from the mainland 
and about a three hours drive from boston is like many seaside 
resorts its population normally around 4000 swells to more than 
10 times that in the summer tourist dollars provide a livelihood 
for many residents but its largely seasonal work 
most young residents work in the summertime and collect 
unemployment benefits in the winter said edward g boxer the 
high schools guidance counselor theres not a lot of highpaying 
jobs 
francis often talked about how important education was for 
expanding a persons options roberts said in the end francis 
stayed true to her adopted family she died from cancer in 1983 but 
her bequest established a fund of almost 800000 enough to offer 
financial aid of 500 to 5000 for every collegebound student 
between 30 and 40 students graduate from provincetown high each 
year and more than threequarters go on to two and fouryear 
colleges 
students say the money encourages them to think about wider 
options 
whereas before maybe some kids ruled out college altogether 
maybe now theyll consider it said one recent scholarship 
recipient on monday william rogers who used his 5000 award to 
help pay tuition at worcester polytechnic institute 
i just think more are thinking about going to college said 
elmer silva who retired in 1985 as the high schools principal 
and even if they go and only last a year its expanding their 
horizons 
they are also thinking more about francis although she remains 
something of an enigma even to those who knew her 
dr wilsa ryder who was francis neighbor for the last six years 
of her life suggests francis was trying to repay the community for 
the scholarship she accepted more than 60 years ago 
i think thats why she bequeathed this huge amount in order to 
pay back that scholarship grant said ryder who sits on the 
committee charged with dispensing the fund 
the scholarship program itself is not without controversy the 
scholarship committee has come under fire from residents for the way 
it awards the money and the amounts it doles out 
in the four years that the scholarships have been awarded less 
than half of the available interest of about 80000 a year has been 
handed out this year applicants got a total of 30000 and in an 
irony that might have pained francis the committee rejected one 
student on the basis that aid was not needed 
the will stipulated those with need and academic ability get a 
scholahship but almost every applicant gets some money 
ryder said that management expenses and the need to add to the 
principal to keep pace with inflation have cut into the available 
funding 
it always sounds like a terrible bundle but the cost rises 
each year she said

a teenager was arraigned under heavy 
security monday in connection with the labor day weekend stabbings 
and beatings of a woman and her two daughters and the death of a 
woman in 1987 
craig price 15 entered no plea to four counts of delinquency by 
firstdegree murder and two counts of burglary family court judge 
carmine dipetrillo ordered price held at the state training school 
a juvenile prison for his protection and the protection of the 
public 
the judge closed the second floor of the kent county courthouse 
to all but reporters lawyers and police because of certain death 
threats that were made against the defendant dipetrillo and 
attorney general james e oneil did not elaborate 
price a former high school football player known as iron man 
who was repeating the ninth grade said nothing during the hearing 
his mother father and older brother attended the hearing but had no 
comment 
he gave a statement to the investigating detectives which 
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both 
homicides blanchard said at a news conference after the 
arraignment 
about 30 people gathered outside the courthouse including some 
of prices friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone 
price was arrested sunday at his house about a block from where 
joan heaton 39 and her daughters jennifer 10 and melissa 8 
were found beaten and stabbed to death in their home sept 4 
stabbing victim rebecca a spencer 27 who died in july 1987 
lived two houses away from price 
he gave a statement to the investigating detectives which 
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both 
homicides police chief wesley blanchard said at a news conference 
after the arraignment 
some residents of the neighborhood said they had been wary of 
letting their children play outside because of the killings and gun 
dealers and alarm companies reported increased business 
dipetrillo said price was charged with three counts of deliquency 
firstdegree murder and one count of deliquency burglary in the 
heaton killings he also was charged with one count each of 
deliquency firstdegree murder and burglary in spencers killing 
oneil said that under the states juvenile laws price if found 
delinquent could be held at the training school only until age 21 
the attorney general has been unsuccessfully trying to get the 
general assembly to pass legislation allowing juveniles under age 16 
who face capital charges to be tried as adults 
dipetrillo set a probable cause hearing for thursday at which the 
state must outline its case against price investigators have 
declined to provide details so far 
an autopsy revealed that ms heaton and her daughters had bruises 
and numerous broken bones apparently from a struggle with their 
killer leading police to speculate the killer might have been cut 
or injured 
scott putnam 18 who said he lived with the prices until a few 
days ago said price showed him a cut left index finger when putnam 
returned home early on sept 2 
you could see the bone on one side it was deep putnam said 
price said he had punched out a car window he said 
richard andrews 18 said price also showed him the cut but 
hours before police said they believed the heatons were killed 
although andrews described price as a tough and vicious 
lineman on the football team i just dont think hes capable of 
it hes not coldhearted like that

as the 44th general assembly opens 
diplomats and officials are looking forward to a new era of 
international cooperation after last years session saw an end to 
the cold war 
in the last two years the 159 nations have built upon the thaw 
between the superpowers addressing in earnest issues such as 
peacekeeping pollution and the world economy in a new cooperative 
spirit 
theres a feeling that fundamental changes are happeningand 
that now is not the timeto play up national differences said 
ronald i spiers the undersecretary for general assembly affairs 
people want to work together and seek solutions to problems rather 
than score debating points 
president reagan and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
approved that approach in speeches to the general assembly last year 
those speeches said dante m caputo of argentina the departing 
assembly president are the deepest and most eloquent reflection 
of profound change that has occurred 
they demonstrate i would venture to say the end of the cold 
war which hovered over our world for such a long period he said 
on monday caputo closed the yearlong 43rd session of the general 
assembly several unresolved issues were postponed for consideration 
by the 44th session which was to begin today the most dramatic was 
the palestinian question and israels crackdown on the 21monthold 
uprising in the occupied territories that has left at least 572 
palestinians and 40 israelis dead 
that issue also provoked the biggest controversy of last years 
assembly when the state department refused to allow plo chairman 
yasser arafat to enter the united states to address the assembly 
washington denied him a visa on the grounds that arafat supported 
terrorism against israel 
the general assembly took the unprecedented protest step of 
moving to geneva for five days in december to hear the palestine 
liberation organization chief 
at the geneva meeting arafat renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist eliminating the two key issues on which the 
state department had refused his visa request 
arafat has said he wants to address this years general assembly 
the state department has said it has not yet received a visa request 
and will not comment on whether it would be granted 
spiers the topranking american in the world body and a former 
state department undersecretary told reporters that arafat should 
be allowed to speak if he wishes 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud said he was confident the 
bush administration would grant a visa if one was requested 
if the visa is not granted said maksoud of course we would 
want to go back to geneva the arab league has more than enough 
allies in the assembly to change its venue 
among speakers scheduled to present their governments views are 
president bush who is to address the assembly monday and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze set to speak the following day 
president virgilio barco vargas of colombia on sept 29 will have 
a chance to speak about his nations battle against the cocaine 
cartels 
other heads of state scheduled to speak include the presidents of 
brazil venezuela argentina peru paraguay bolivia el salvador 
costa rica guatemala yugoslavia egypt cyprus zaire and lesotho 
the assembly was to choose a new president today 
under a system of rotating regional representation the african 
nations nominated the assembly leader this year they selected 
nigerias un ambassador maj gen joseph garba a crusader 
against apartheid south africas legal system of racial segregation 
the main portion of the general assemblys work ends in 
middecember but it will then hold a fiveday special session on 
apartheid

interstate three years ago 
i was driving along heading south on i5 and i could just

a man who spent 20 years on the rodeo 
circuit now makes his living making boots and other items that fit 
the special needs of professional cowboys 
and a few yuppies who would like to look like professional 
cowboys 
veldon morgan his wife and two sons run the old spade western 
store that greets visitors to this community of about twodozen 
people in the heart of the nebraska panhandle 
handmade morgan boots which line the walls of the rustic store 
built in 1869 run from 119 to 750 excluding custom orders 
the newest boot a laceup roper was the brainchild of the 
54yearold morgan and a professional rodeo friend and customer 
regular cowboy boots have a somewhat flimsy shaft explained 
wayne morgan veldons son and general manager professional 
ropers complain that when they step jump or fly off a horse its 
easy to twist an ankle in conventional boots 
a ushaped toe and a block heel make the new laceup boots 
working boots bound to be a hit with cowboys 
the professional rodeo cowboy is a honed athlete but theyve 
always had to dress like a ranch cowboy the elder morgan said 
monday 
to send them into the rodeo arena dressed like a ranch cowboy 
is like sending a boxer into the ring wearing cowboy boots said 
morgan who was on the professional rodeo circuit for 20 years 
the guy with the boxing shoes would beat the other guy every 
time 
the company also has found a new market one wed never expect 
among yuppies on the coasts his son said 
the idea of a laceup cowboy boot must just appeal to them 
so apparently does the gear used to carry coiled ropes and 
boots and saddles he said 
weve expanded the nylon luggage line into a whole area of 
backpacking horsepacking and camping equipment as well wayne 
morgan said 
more than 40 people work in the large manufacturing plant and 
warehouses attached to the store 
the complex has been expanded twice as the business has grown 
wayne morgan said last spring the company bought the laramie boot 
co and some manufacturing is done in el paso texas 
handmade saddles ranging from 895 to 2000 have become another 
staple of the business it takes 15 hours to assemble a plain 
saddles 25 to 30 parts wayne morgan said 
craftsmen work at individual booths in the factory concentrating 
on one saddle at a time 
weve tried to make things that are needed vernon morgan 
said somebody made laceup boots back in the 30s and then quit 
we decided to pick it up again its a new frontier out there

longterm studies with azt show the aids drug can 
reverse many symptoms of the disease in children while avoiding side 
effects researchers say 
the drug previously has been shown to extend the lives of adults 
with aids and to delay the development of symptoms in those who are 
infected but not yet sick 
a year ago national cancer institute scientists reported it 
could prevent brain abnormalities in children but concerns about 
its side effects remained 
the most extensive study of azt in children now shows it is safe 
helps children gain weight and avoid lifethreatening infections 
and improves their wellbeing says ross mckinney of duke university 
in north carolina 
the study part of a national institutes of health project to 
assess azt in children was reported monday at a meeting of the 
american society for microbiology 
at the same time azts maker burroughs wellcome co of research 
triangle park nc announced it was cutting the wholesale price of 
the drug by 20 percent from 150 to 120 per capsule a years 
supply has been costing patients 7000 to 8000 
in other studies reported here national cancer institute 
researchers said they had obtained promising initial results with 
two newer aids drugs called ddi and ddc 
the drugs helped restore some brain function to a few children 
out of several dozen tested without causing dangerous side effects 
said dr philip pizzo the institutes chief of pediatrics 
a 32monthold boy who had lost the ability to stand and walk and 
was losing his speech all because of an aids infection in the 
brain stood began walking with help and began to speak more 
clearly after being given ddi said dr karina butler of the cancer 
institute 
about onethird of the children given ddi and ddc showed signs 
that their aidsdamaged immune systems were at least partially 
restored 
furthermore both the new drugs seem to work well in combination 
with azt said pizzo 
that seems to us to be an area worthy of study he said 
were on the lookout for agents that can be put into combination 
regimens 
the combination may as is the case with cancer drugs reduce 
side effects while increasing efficacy pizzo explained one child 
in the study for example could not tolerate regular doses of azt 
without serious side effects but is now doing well on an alternating 
combination of azt and ddc 
twelve of 35 children required blood transfusions to counteract 
anemia caused by azts toxic effects on their bone marrow mckinney 
said some also showed low white blood cell counts but those side 
effects were considered manageable 
only five of the patients developed the socalled opportunistic 
infections that often kill aids patients 
the children ranged from 5 months to 13 years old ten were 
younger than age 2 its looking more and more that thats whos 
going to be getting it among kids mckinney said 
giving it to children early may delay the development of serious 
brain disorders which occur in about 80 percent of children with 
aids mckinney said 
determining when to give azt to children will be difficult 
however because studies have shown that aids can be quite different 
in children and adults mckinney said 
it may be that children need to start earlier and get higher 
doses he said 
for example aids doesnt usually appear in adults until their 
t4cell count a measure of the immune systems health drops below 
500 adults with a t4cell count above 500 are usually healthy 
thats not a valid number for children said mckinney all 
of us have lost kids who have had t4 counts above 1000

backers of a holiday to honor assassinated civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr are hoping the prospect of a 
super bowl can succeed where convention boycotts and bad publicity 
failed 
without a holiday there is little chance in arizona for a 
super bowl house minority leader art hamilton a democrat who 
leads the proholiday forces said monday 
bill shover a newspaper executive who heads the booster group 
phoenix 93 agreed 
we feel sure if we dont have a king holiday we wont be on a 
level playing field for the 93 super bowl said shover director 
of community and corporate services for phoenix newspapers inc 
publishers of the arizona republic and the phoenix gazette 
the issue comes up as part of a special session that begins 
wednesday on prison crowding drugs and economic development and 
both sides are squirming already 
if we fail again the frustration level will rise 
hamilton said 
but senate president bob usdane a republican who wants the issue 
referred to a general election ballot said the bill is not 
appropriate for a special session 
with a special session you want to get out quickly usdane 
said you dont need controversy in a special session 
the republicancontrolled house has voted for a king holiday in 
the past but conservative senate republicans have defeated the 
proposal 
the fight has been going on for years 
democratic gov bruce babbitt then about to launch a 
presidential campaign and frustrated by lack of progress on the king 
issue signed an executive proclamation in 1986 giving state 
employees the day off 
republican state attorney general bob corbin declared that 
babbitt lacked authority to issue such an order however babbitts 
successor republican evan mecham rescinded the proclamation before 
it could take effect 
mecham also said he did not believe that king deserved a holiday 
and civil rights groups launched a boycott of the state as a 
convention site 
mechams impeachment in april 1988 on unrelated charges brought 
secretary of state rose mofford to power as governor mrs mofford 
a democrat has pledged to do whatever is necessary for a king 
holiday 
but while mrs mofford has lobbied quietly for the bill since 
then most senate republicans have held fast against it 
a recent study estimates the state has lost 256 million in 
convention and tourist business since mechams order and some super 
bowl boosters say phoenixs bid for the 1993 game is doomed if 
theres no holiday 
but some senate republicans say the holiday is a slap in the face 
to abraham lincoln because it would follow the federal practice of 
combining holidays for lincoln and george washington into a single 
holiday in exchange for a state holiday honoring king 
some gop senators have offered to vote for a bill that would 
trade in columbus day for king day but mrs mofford said she 
rejects that option and democratic lawmakers say they would prefer 
to avoid it even though they consider it a possibility 
religious leaders and business executives have been urging 
approval of the king holiday for years but republican lawmakers say 
their constituents dont agree 
furthermore they note many of the businesses that are pushing 
for the holiday dont even give their own employees the day off 
they ought to take a look in the mirror said sen doug todd 
a republican who is among those targeted by the executives

tired of all those videocassettes cluttering up 
your house wouldnt it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite tv 
soaps or five or six movies on one cassette 
how about 30 hours of recording per cassette 
west german videocassette manufacturer basf says that by 1991 it 
will be offering us viewers a tape with a 10hour capacity 
meanwhile a finnish company nokia says it has developed a new 
technology allowing a new line of vhs recorders to cram those 10 
hours onto a tape without the loss of picture quality that results 
when todays vcrs are cranked down to their slowest speeds 
the picture quality is better than existing longplay 
systems nokia spokesman lauri kivinen said in a telephone 
interview last week 
nokia a major manufacturer of television sets in europe hopes 
to license its new technology to vcr manufacturers and the new 
recorders could be on the market sometime in 1990 kivinen said 
the basf tape will be usable on existing videocassette recorders 
basf will use a superstrong thin polyester film to pile more tape 
into each videocassette according to the sept 11 issue of tv 
digest which reviewed the new nokia and basf products at the berlin 
audiovisual fair 
the basf cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on vcrs 
with a european system that uses a slower speed than us 
videocassette recorders 
us vcrs provide two hours of recording at normal speed on a 
standard cassette american vcrs also have a halfspeed longplay 
mode that allows four hours of recording and a onethird 
extendedplay speed that allows six hours of recording 
the higher the taping speed the better the image quality 
nokia says it has found a way to record at a speed equivalent to 
the extendedplay mode while maintaining image quality that is 
better than longplay mode 
kivinen said nokia hopes its system will become the new standard 
for vcrs tv digest quoted the systems inventor nokia engineer 
gerd reime as saying that although no tests have been conducted 30 
hours of taping may be possible using his new technology 
reime said the new circuitry could cost as little as 3 to 
incorporate into new vcrs 
basf has been testing its new super longplay tape for about a 
year and will introduce it in europe this fall according to tom 
neidhart director of marketing at basfs information systems 
division in bedford mass 
by 1991 we expect to offer the 10hour tape in the us 
neidhart said 
basf already markets a videocassette in the united states that 
allows eight hours of taping at slow speed but the tape has 
captured only a small percentage of the blank videocassette market 
which is approaching 300 million units in annual sales neidhart 
said 
basf launched a national television ad campaign last month to try 
to boost sales for the eighthour tape 
we know from research that most people would like to use a 
longer tape for some or all of their recording purposes neidhart 
said noting that it means viewers wont run out of tape too soon 
and that the tapes will take up less space in their video libraries

the bush administration plans to boost 
hungarys trade status following a series of steps viewed by us 
officials as progress on economic and political issues by the warsaw 
pact nation 
hungary has undertaken major steps toward economic and 
political reform leading to the us plan to grant mostfavored 
nation status to the eastern european communist state president 
bush said on monday 
speaking at a news conference in helena mont bush said the 
move will open new doors for the hungarian economy encouraging 
greater market orientation and increasing the foreign exchange 
earnings 
that and other initiatives were announced monday by commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher who was in budapest for talks with 
hungarian officials 
meanwhile the washington post today quoted hungarys new 
parliament speaker matyas szuros as saying he sees the possibility 
that his nation could withdraw from the warsaw pact and become 
neutral by the end of the century 
szuros said the shift to neutrality could take place within a 
climate of trust between hungary and the soviet union 
the package announced by mosbacher also includes new development 
programs and the establishment of a 25 million fund to help create 
private business in hungary 
the proposals are part of a comprehensive pact to support 
hungarys efforts to develop a freer political system and to create 
and expand private enterprise said mosbacher 
the white house released bushs letter to congress in which he 
said it is my intent to add hungary to the list of countries 
that qualify for mostfavored nation status which would guarantee 
hungary the lowest tariffs for its products that any competing 
country gets 
hungary recently defied authorities in east berlin by allowing 
thousands of east german citizens to use hungary as a conduit to 
emigrate to west germany in may hungary tore down the barbed wire 
fence that had sharply restricted travel by hungarians to the west 
according to his spokeswoman the only foreign gift that 
secretary of state james a baker iii keeps in his office is a piece 
of the fence which hungarian officials gave him during his visit to 
hungary in july 
the administration also attaches significance officials said to 
the withdrawal of some soviet troops from hungary in recent months 
part of a commitment by soviet president mikhail gorbachev to reduce 
overall troop levels in eastern europe 
mondays announcement came four days after bushs decision to 
double food aid to poland another warsaw pact member to 100 
million in the next fiscal year 
many in congress had criticized bush for not doing more for 
poland following the accession of a noncommunist premier in warsaw 
there has been less pressure for an increase in us cooperation 
with hungary because polands economic situation is far bleaker than 
hungarys 
mosbacher said the 25 million to help develop private business 
in hungary is an important part of implementing president bushs 
goal of building an american partnership with hungary 
he said hungary will be granted permanent mostfavored trade 
status in october if its parliament as expected enacts legislation 
on freedom of emigration by the end of september 
mosbacher also said bush is notifying congress of his intention 
to designate hungary as eligible for generalized system of 
preferences treatment which would offer hungarian exporters 
dutyfree tariff treatment for a broad range of exports to the 
united states worth more than 110 million 
meanwhile senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
complained monday that the bush administration hasnt moved quickly 
enough to support east european communist nations such as hungary 
that are moving toward democratic change 
the administrations timidity in the face of these 
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying mitchell told the senate 
instead of encouragement and engagement the administration has 
adopted an almost passive stance

the american who sponsored boris n yeltsins 
tour of america strongly denies accusations published by a soviet 
newspaper that the communist party maverick was publicly drunk for 
much of the trip 
if there was any problem with yeltsin it was jet lag said 
jim garrison executive director of the esalen institute 
sovietamerican exchange program which sponsored the nineday 
11city tour most of the time he was cold sober 
pravda organ of the soviet communist party central committee on 
monday reprinted an article from the italian newspaper la republica 
saying yeltsin was repeatedly drunk during the tour and squandered 
his lecture fees shopping 
yeltsin leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic prophecies 
insane expenses interviews and above all the perfume of jack 
daniels black label said the article translated into russian 
pravda did not comment on the article but advertised it in a 
frontpage box that said yeltsin found the united states a 
holiday a stage a bar 5000 kilometers long 
yeltsin interviewed as he arrived back in moscow from the trip 
called the report garbage 
its a simple lie slander and revenge for the fact that 
americans received us with admiration he said flushing with 
anger 
the pravda article clearly reflected kremlin anger at yeltsins 
criticism of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other top 
leaders while in the united states yeltsin said gorbachev had made 
mistakes and faced a potential revolution from soviet citizens 
dissatisfied with the pace of reform 
yeltsin was dumped from his job as moscow party chief and his 
post on the ruling politburo for making similar comments in late 
1987 but moscow voters overwhelmingly elected him to the newly 
constituted congress of peoples deputies last march 
before leaving america yeltsin predicted the knives would be 
out on his return said garrison who accompanied him throughout 
the tour 
what pravda has done is for political motivations said 
garrison 
asked to comment on reports that yeltsin drank a bottle and a 
half of whiskey the night before he spoke in baltimore last tuesday 
garrison said 
he certainly did not finish off a bottle and a half of jack 
daniels the entire delegation of five soviets drank a bottle but 
for five soviet men to drink a bottle of jack daniels thats 
normal thats the culture soviets tend to drink a lot 
yeltsin suffered from jet lag and a hectic schedule and by the 
time he spoke in baltimore said garrison he had not slept for 
three nights 
garrison said he personally called off a scheduled appearance by 
yeltsin on the abctv program nightline to be taped last 
monday the afternoon before the baltimore speech 
i canceled it because he was jetlagged he was just 
dropping garrison said in an interview in washington

deals in exchange programs with the soviet union 
the fund will ship 100000 worth of medical equipment to the 
soviet union primarily in the form of disposable syringes said 
garrison 
all the bills are not in yet but he is going to earn roughly 
20000 to 40000 from the lecture tour said garrison the 
gross was close to 160000 to 170000 the speakers bureau will 
take 30 percent and much of the balance will pay the costs of the 
nineperson entourage 
yeltsin will accept none of the proceeds all of the proceeds 
will go to buy medical equipment said garrison

the moskva hotel off red square and by the foundation for social 
innovation which has offices in san francisco and moscow

stampeded plucked left in the dust the angry 
headlines in texas newspapers said it all 
the cbs miniseries lonesome dove a saga of western frontier 
life got barely a nod from the television industry in sunday 
nights emmy awards and texans werent happy about it 
its something that you cant help feeling bitter or upset 
about said helen human the dallas actress who portrayed the 
bossy and buxom peach 
the epic depicted a cattle drive from dusty lonesome dove texas 
to montana its central characters were two aging texas rangers 
portrayed by robert duvall and tommy lee jones 
although lonesome dove gathered a leading seven trophies 
including saturdays technical ceremony the adaptation of larry 
mcmurtrys acclaimed novel won only one key category sunday for 
director simon wincer it received 18 nominations more than any 
show 
i just wish the people who were more vitally involved with it 
got the recognition they needed to get said ms human it kind 
of gives me the impression that somebody woke up with a sore tooth 
when they voted thats how ridiculous it is 
sore heads might have been involved too ms human said 
mr duval is a very talented person but hes also a very 
strong person and a lot of times hollywood doesnt like that 
but theres no way youre going to know for sure 
a television critic at the fort worth startelegram called the 
decision an unbelievable lapse in judgment 
the television academy of arts and sciences embarrassed itself 
by refusing to honor lonesome dove as the seasons finest 
miniseries art chapman wrote 
the winner of that category was the monumental abc saga war and 
remembrance 
many industry watchers thought duvall had a virtual lock on a 
best actor emmy for his portrayal of the talkative texas ranger gus 
the award went instead to james woods who played the cofounder of 
alcoholics anonymous in the cbs movie my name is bill w 
even dan curtis the executive producer of war and

defense secretary dick cheney says hes 
satisfied navy officials investigating the explosion that killed 47 
sailors on the uss iowa did the best job they could 
cheney told reporters monday he had no reason to question the 
finding that gunners mate clayton hartwig apparently caused the 
blast by inserting a detonating device between bags of gunpowder in 
the ships illfated no2 gun turret 
i do think its important to point out that the information or 
the evidence thats available is incomplete cheney said in his 
first extensive public statement about the report 
well never know with absolute certainty exactly what 
transpired because of the nature of the incident itself he said 
in the report issued earlier this month the navy said the blast 
apparently was caused by a detonating device between bags of 
gunpowder and that the hartwig the gun captain at the time was the 
most likely person to have sabotaged the firing the report said 
uncertainty remains however because all the witnesses died in the 
explosion 
navy officials also said they had ruled out technical reason for 
the blast after conducting some 20000 tests on the gunpowder and 
guns used aboard the ship 
i think the navy did the best job they could under the 
circumstances on the iowa i think the investigation was a good 
one cheney said 
cheney said the service did a good technical job of checking 
out all conceivable possibilities by which that incident might have 
occurred such as an accident because of the gunpowder exploding 
prematurely or some other such thing 
i am satisfied with that aspect of it he said 
hartwigs family has criticized the report for singling him out 
but cheney said rear adm richard milligan the investigating 
officer was required to provide his best conclusion on what 
happened 
thats what hes done cheney said i dont have any reason 
to question it 
media general newspapers reported sunday that experiments were 
being conducted on the iowa using an improper number of powder bags 
combined with the heaviestweight type of projectile 
the navy confirmed monday that experiments took place but that 
they didnt cause the explosion 
navy spokesman cmdr craig quigley noted milligen had included 
information about the unauthorized tests in his report and had 
mentioned the unauthorized use of five bags instead of six bags of 
powder in the no 2 gun turret which exploded 
the improper loading configuration did not cause nor did it 
contribute to the explosion quigley said ditto for the 
powder 
the report says such experiments had been conducted aboard the 
iowa from nov 4 1987 until the day of the explosion 
the report also notes fred moosally the iowa captain had 
approved the use of reduced charge loads but that he thought that 
meant six 55pound bags of powder instead of the larger bags of 
around 90110 pounds 
moosally did not have the authority to approve such tests 
quigley said 
the report called for the navys inspector general to look into 
the unauthorized tests and rear adm ming chang plans to do so 
quigley said 
because of the many improper procedures found aboard the iowa 
such as the gunpowder experiments it has been left to adm powell 
f carter the chief of the atlantic fleet to decide whether 
disciplinary action might be taken 
the battleship currently is in the mediterranean sea

educators already strapped by tight budgets as 
they seek to improve classroom achievements face billions of dollars 
in maintenance and construction costs in the next few years the 
national governors association says 
local school districts which historically have been responsible 
for running and paying for their school buildings have seen 
maintenance costs increase 64 percent since 1983 to 41 billion 
according to a report the governors association issued monday 
in addition existing plans to renovate or build schools are 
expected to cost 84 billion the associations annual 50state 
survey said warning the costs could undercut direct education 
programs 
the projected costs for new school construction and maintenance 
and repairs for existing schools are so enormous that they can 
overwhelm policymakers said the report called results in 
education 1989 
when these estimates are broken down on a perstudent or annual 
basis over a 20year period the price tag may seem more manageable 
still unless addressed the problem will mount as aging suburban 
schools reach the end of their intended life span and urban and 
rural schools deteriorate further 
the association said rural schools are particularly pressed 
noting another report that described half of the rural schools as 
being unsafe outdated and inadequate 
in addition the report said many school districts are seeing 
money drained from their budgets to finance litigation because of 
lawsuits 
several states are considering measures to relieve the pressure 
on local officials by providing state support for school 
construction costs said the report 
iowa gov terry e branstad the association president and new 
mexico gov garrey e carruthers released the report a week before 
the education summit the governors will have with president bush in 
charlottesville va 
it is time for us as governors to pay careful attention to what 
is being taught in our schools and to what students are expected to 
learn branstad said governors are powerful agents of change 
and the report that we submit today is evidence of that fact 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
said the heart of this report is not so much in what the states 
are doing but in the introduction and unfinished agenda sections 
that tell us what we have yet to do to turn our public schools 
around 
key findings of the report included 
32 states are improving teacher recruitment and retention five 
states now have teacher licensing boards on which a majority of the 
members are administrators and teachers thirteen states are trying 
to increase the number of minority teachers 
41 states report new expanded or proposed parent involvement 
policies including 16 with programs to assist parents in becoming 
effective teachers at home 
31 states now offer preschool and other early childhood 
programs and 34 states offer alternative programs for high schools 
nearly half the states use computers to maintain student 
records train teachers evaluate curriculum and instruct students 
simply stated restructuring means that we are trying to find 
better ways to organize our schools to prepare our teachers and to 
determine what students must know and be able to do said branstad

defense secretary dick cheney promising a 
more aggressive pentagon role in the international drug battle 
is giving regional military leaders a month to come up with details 
to carry it out 
i think the relative level of effort compared to what has 
been done in the past will be significantly greater cheney 
pledged when he announced his project at a pentagon briefing on 
monday 
in an attempt to fulfill the pentagon role as the nations lead 
agency in the drug interdiction effort cheney acknowledges that the 
agency may have to make some tradeoffs because of evershrinking 
budgets 
but he said the new attentiveness toward illicit narcotics as a 
national security threat should not in any way conflict with our 
basic mission of defending the country 
cheney said he had told the heads of the various major military 
commands to draw up plans by oct 15 to use planes ships radar and 
troops to help stem the flow of drugs into the united states 
the secretary said he could not estimate the cost of the effort 
nor the number of servicemen and women needed until the commanders 
report back to him 
cheney said the defense department will emphasize stopping drugs 
from entering the country but also will help fight drug abuse and 
aid other nations in attacking drugs at their source 
i hope that our interdiction efforts will be more successful in 
the future in part because weve got more aggressive efforts now 
underway in the host countries and a greater willingness for them to 
cooperate in our efforts cheney said 
he said the pentagon planned a more aggressive and robust 
posture to help president bush implement his antidrug fight in 
the andean nations as well 
until now the pentagons role has been to support the efforts of 
state national guard units which have been used for such duties as 
inspecting cargo at ports of entry taking part in aerial searches 
for marijuana crops and helping transport law enforcement officials 
or contraband those efforts have varied from state to state 
cheney insisted that in no case would the pentagon be drawn into 
a law enforcement role 
nor he said will us forces overseas be sent into combat 
theres a clear line out there cheney said that the military 
will not cross 
its a dangerous business i hope nobodys hurt in the process 
but i cant guarantee it cheney said adding that us personnel 
are acting under rules of engagement that allow them to defend 
themselves 
asked whether he backed shooting down planes that refuse to 
identify themselves and are suspected of smuggling drugs as some in 
congress have suggested cheney said the department has no such 
authority and does not intend to ask for it 
cheney said the department intends to deploy appropriate 
elements of the armed forces to help reduce the flow of drugs into 
the country but cited no specific numbers or types of military 
personnel 
among other things the secretary said he has asked the 
commanders to 
plan for a substantial caribbean counternarcotics task force 
with appropriate planes and ships to cut the drug flow from latin 
america 
study the use of military forces to support the counterdrug 
work of us law enforcement agencies such as the drug enforcement 
administration and cooperating foreign governments in 
particular mexico 
examine for the use of hightech facilities available at norad 
north american aerospace defense command to help detect illegal 
drug traffic coming across the nations borders 
find ways of combating the production and trafficking of illegal 
drugs in conjunction with unnamed cooperating host countries

senate republicans concede president bushs 
antidrug strategy needs some work but their talks with democrats 
have left the two sides without agreement so far on how it should be 
reshaped 
democratic and gop senators planned to meet again today in their 
search for a package of antidrug measures agreeable to lawmakers of 
both parties the bargaining which began friday is being fueled by 
both sides claim to the lead role in attacking illegal drugs and 
drugrelated crimes issues party leaders say are uppermost on the 
publics mind 
a twohour session monday evening produced no deal 
republicans emerged saying they still supported the 79 billion 
package for fiscal 1990 beginning oct 1 that bush outlined sept 
5 and democrats said they remained behind the 101 billion plan 
they countered with a week later a proposal that garnered a quick 
veto threat from white house aides 
i dont think were at the point yet where we know what theyre 
proposing other than the presidents plan sen robert byrd 
dwva author of the democratic plan said after the session 
a general profile of a compromise that might ultimately arise 
did however begin to emerge 
sen mark hatfield of oregon the republicans chief negotiator 
said gop lawmakers are willing to help narrow the gap between 
the two sides spending proposals for treatment and prevention 
programs the democrats want more emphasis on those initiatives than 
bush sought 
hatfield also said republicans supported the democratic concept 
of paying for the extra antidrug spending by cutting other programs 
across the board he said the amount the democrats want to slice off 
other programs would have to be reduced and indicated other changes 
in their plan might be sought as well 
we agree on more than we disagree upon hatfield said 
bushs proposal which would increase spending over this years 
efforts by 22 billion would be weighted heavily to law 
enforcement prisons and interdiction prevention and treatment 
programs would get 27 percent of the total 
byrd proposed not only beefing up the presidents package but 
changing the distribution of the 101 billion byrd proposes 65 
percent would go to law enforcement and 35 percent to prevention and 
treatment 
that plan backed by senate democratic leaders would finance its 
costs by snipping 0575 percent from most of the budget bush 
identified how he would pay for only about 750 million of his 
proposal suggesting cuts in a halfdozen other programs 
democrats said bushs plan does not throw enough of a financial 
punch at the problem before byrd introduced his measure some 
democrats said new taxes are needed to adequately finance antidrug 
initiatives 
but republicans have complained the democratic alternative is too 
costly and provides too much to prevention programs they also 
object to the 18 billion slice the acrosstheboard cuts would 
take out of the pentagons 300 billion budget

i cant say im totally unconcerned but i dont have any hard 
evidence that should further alarm the american people in this

a trustees committee and the director of the 
corcoran gallery of art are seeking to heal relations with the art 
community by expressing regret for canceling a planned exhibit that 
included sexually provocative photographs by robert mapplethorpe 
our course in the future will be to support art artists and 
freedom of artistic expression they said in a statement released 
monday 
the june cancellation was an attempt to avoid a worsening 
political controversy over the use of federal funds by the national 
endowment for the arts to back controversial works the corcorans 
director christina orrcahall has said 
the action however seemed to have attracted more attention to 
the issue on all sides and many artists have denounced the 
corcoran the nations oldest art museum 
several artists have called for a boycott and two have pulled out 
of corcoran exhibits artist lowell nesbitt withdrew 1 million in 
property and art he had intended to will the museum 
the exhibit photographs by the late mapplethorpe was staged at 
the washington project for the arts meanwhile and drew record 
crowds 
the statement from orrcahall and the executive committee of the 
trustees said by withdrawing from the mapplethorpe exhibition 
we the board of trustees and the director have inadvertently 
offended many members of the arts community which we deeply 
regret 
endowment funds totalling 45000 were used to prepare the 
exhibition and also to show a photograph by andre serrano of the 
crucified christ in a jar of urine 
sen jesse helms rnc had begun a drive to bar endowment 
funds to support any sexually explicit or blasphemous material the 
senate has enacted such a provision in the endowments 
appropriations bill the house has refused to go along and simply 
voted to reduce the appropriation by 45000 the two versions will 
have to be reconciled

oil companies have obtained waivers from the 
federal communications commission to eliminate radio officers on 
many tankers a costcutting move that critics contend will increase 
the chances of oil spills 
the fcc requirement that all large ships carry at least one 
trained radio officer originated in the 1930s when ships needed 
someone skilled in the pitpatpit of morse code says exxon 
shipping co spokesman leslie c rogers 
since that kind of radio telegraphy is obsolete theres no 
longer a need for a job category like this on these merchant 
ships rogers said in a telephone interview monday 
but two unions the american radio officers association and the 
radio officers union which represent about 600 seagoing officers 
are objecting to the waivers on safety grounds 
with support from some ship captains they contend that every 
large merchant ship should carry someone trained to repair radio 
equipment and handle communications during an emergency leaving the 
captain and mates free to supervise other operations such as 
firefighting and damage control 
the fccs critics point to the case of the exxon philadelphia 
which in april suffered an apparent breakdown of an electronic fuel 
sensor that left it drifting aimlessly off the west coast for nearly 
seven hours with 22 million gallons of oil aboard 
the ships radio officer who had been eliminated under an fcc 
waiver just a few weeks earlier might have quickly solved the 
problem because of the officers expertise in electronics they 
claim 
exxon however says it is doubtful that a radio officer would 
have made a difference in the case the company also maintains it 
has ensured safe communications on its tankers by installing 
duplicate radio systems and training various crewmembers to operate 
them 
this is just a false issue raised by certain unions trying to 
capitalize on the unfortunate alaskan oil spill said rogers 
william luther an adviser to the fcc on international shipping 
said the government began granting waivers in 1982 to eliminate 
radio operators on usregistered oil tankers and large cargo 
vessels operating along the us coast 
despite objections by more than a dozen environmental groups 
those coastal waivers have continued and additional waivers have 
been extended this year on a shipbyship basis to 30 to 40 other 
vessels plying the waters from alaska to panama luther said 
luther said the simplicity and sophistication of automated and 
satellite communications eliminate the need for the intermediate 
operator any more 
some companies including arco marine the shipping arm of 
atlantic richfield corp have decided to retain radio specialists 
primarily because of their ability to make repairs but more than 
half a dozen major shippers including mobil texaco sunoco and 
chevron have applied for and received new waivers the fcc said 
mobil shipping co spokesman john lord contended that 
technological improvements including shiptosatellite transmitters 
and snapin circuit boards have made communications more reliable 
than ever 
its far safer now when the guy in charge on the bridge can 
just pick up a phone and have instantaneous voicetovoice contact 
with points all over the globe he said morse code and all that 
is just not necessary any more 
but a ships captain speaking to the boston globe on condition 
of anonymity said the added responsibility for communications could 
be a problem in an emergency 
what if i get in trouble he said say my ship is on fire 
or i send an sos do i stay on the bridge and direct firefighting 
or do i go in the radio room where am i supposed to go now

a teenager known as iron man was 
charged with four slayings in his neighborhood after he made 
incriminating statements that clinched his connection to the crimes 
police said 
craig e price 15 was arraigned monday at family court under 
heavy security because of death threats under state law he cannot 
be charged as an adult and if found delinquent faces no more than 
six years in juvenile prison 
the 240pound 5foot10 price was described by friends and 
neighbors as a popular rambunctious youth more inclined to football 
than studies 
he was arrested sunday at his home a block from the house where 
he allegedly beat and stabbed to death a woman and her two daughters 
during labor day weekend and two doors from the house of a woman 
stabbed to death in 1987 
a search of prices house produced evidence including a weapon 
that may have been used killings police chief wesley blanchard 
said he declined to describe the items 
we have physical evidence to tie in every step along the way 
blanchard said although he indicated prices selfincriminating 
statements were the primary evidence in the 1987 case 
judge carmen dipetrillo ordered price held at the state training 
school he scheduled a hearing thursday for prosecutors to detail 
evidence 
about 30 people gathered outside the courthouse including some 
of prices friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone 
sheriff antonio giorgio said all 22 officers on his force in this 
town of about 90000 people were called in because you get 
disgruntled neighbors angry neighbors and you have to protect 
against something happening 
price is charged with three counts of deliquency firstdegree 
murder and one count of burglary in the deaths of joan heaton 39 
and her daughters jennifer 10 and melissa 8 who were found in 
their home sept 4 
he is charged with one count of deliquency firstdegree murder 
and one count of deliquency burglary in the 1987 stabbing of rebecca 
a spencer 27 
if found delinquent price could be held at the juvenile prison 
only until age 21 said state attorney general james e oneil 
price was a suspect in the heaton killings right from the 
start because of a cut on his hand and his conflicting statements 
about it said blanchard 
if you wish to call it a confession you can refer to it as that 
but he gave a statement to the investigating detectives which 
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both 
homicides blanchard said 
blanchard however said the motive is uncertain 
an autopsy revealed the three victims had bruises and numerous 
broken bones apparently from a struggle with their killer leading 
police to speculate the killer might have been cut or injured 
scott putnam 18 a friend of prices who waited outside the 
courthouse said he lived with the prices until a few days ago and 
price showed him a cut left index finger when putnam returned home 
at about 1 am sept 2 
you could see the bone on one side it was deep putnam said 
price told him he had punched out a car window putnam said 
police have said an intruder broke into the heaton home through a 
rear window 
price who played varsity football last year was ineligible to 
play this year because he had been held back in the ninth grade his 
mother father and older brother attended the hearing but had no 
comment 
prices lawyer public defender robert e marro declined to 
comment

cigarettes on their behalf and even releasing one who needed to go 
to the bathroom

said he wasnt going to shoot nobody 
after pierces arrival the students he first released warned 
others and the classrooms were cleared 
eversole said pierce was armed with a 357caliber magnum 
revolver a 44caliber revolver and a 12 gauge shotgun that had 
been altered it looked like one youd see in a movie eversole 
said 
more than a dozen state police officers went to the school just 
south of mckee a town of about 1000 people some 65 miles southeast 
of lexington 
police were concerned about references in pierces writing to 
dying at 9 oclock he said itll all end at 9 stephens said 
we didnt want that 9 oclock hour 
pierce surrendered at 630 pm 
sharon judd who had gone to school with pierce since fourth 
grade called him a quiet straighta student who liked guns 
many of the school reports pierce did dealt with war she 
said

was to talk to his father stephens said 
he hasnt seen his father my understanding since hes 4 years 
old stephens said pierce had lived with his grandparents for 
several years 
near the end of the standoff police called on a cousin and close 
friend of pierces to convince him no harm would come to him 
chad madden an 18yearold freshman at nearby eastern kentucky 
university said he and his cousin talked about hunting 
i just talked like i always do madden said he was calm 
pretty smooth he started to cry a little bit when i was talking 
at that point tired and tense pierce was looking for a way to 
end the standoff stephens said 
he wanted to know how many crimes he committed stephens said

federal officials praised 
burroughs wellcome cos decision to reduce the wholesale price of 
azt by 20 percent but some aids activists say the cut isnt deep 
enough 
this is a step in the right direction but a very small step 
says peter staley of the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash 
power its not enough 
burroughs wellcome co announced monday that it will lower the 
wholesale cost of the only federally approved aids treatment citing 
production efficiencies and research that suggests an increasing 
demand for the drug 
the expected growth in patient population coupled with recent 
production economies will reduce somewhat our financial risk and 
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug 
was first introduced said te haigler jr burroughs president 
and chief executive officer 
the company said however it couldnt guarantee that the full 
savings will be passed on to consumers who have been paying 7000 
to 8000 per year for full doses of the drug 
the reduction cuts the price to the wholesale distributor from 
150 to 120 per capsule 
a patient now paying almost 8000 a year for a highdose 12 
capsuleaday prescription of azt would pay more than 6500 a year 
with the lower price people who are infected with the virus but who 
have few or no symptoms of aids generally have a fivecapsulesaday 
prescription and would see their costs reduced to about 2700 a 
year 
louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and human 
services said the price cut combined with recent findings that 
lower dosages may be effective will reduce the cost of azt 
treatment 
this is good news for those infected with hiv who can benefit 
from azt treatment and it is good news for the health care system 
as a whole sullivan said 
the cut was announced after mounting protests by aids activists 
against burroughs wellcome on thursday five people chained 
themselves to a banister at the new york stock exchange to protest 
the cost of azt also called retrovir 
activists argued that some aids patients could not afford the 
drug and that the price discouraged congress from renewing a program 
that subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who cannot 
afford it 
the medical establishment also criticized prices of azt and other 
aids drugs last week in an article published friday in the journal 
of the american medical association researchers blamed price 
gouging by drug companies for part of the estimated 5 billion 
annually it may someday cost to care for aids victims 
company spokesman thack brown insisted that the protests did not 
affect burroughs wellcomes decision 
actually i can say the protests slowed things down a little 
bit he said we had to field inquiries from the media and other 
people about what we planned to do at a time when we were still 
trying to decide what that would be 
staley whose group is know as actup said activists will 
continue to press for lower prices 
actup will continue to fight to make sure that all aids 
treatments are provided to all who need them free of charge which 
means we will continue to pressure burroughs wellcome for further 
price reductions he said 
jean mcguire of the washington dcbased aids action council 
said the price cut is large enough to characterize it as being in 
good faith but it remains to be seen whether its enough 
she added that activists will continue to assess burroughs 
profit margin we hope that as the market increases we will 
continue to see burroughs make good faith assessments about future 
reductions she said 
azt was first shown to be effective against hiv infection in 
september 1986 a trial of the drug revealed a significantly lower 
mortality rate among patients with aids and advanced aidsrelated 
complex who had received azt during the next six months burroughs 
made azt available free to about 5000 patients the company lowered 
the cost 20 percent in 1987 
azt was approved by the food and drug administration in march 
1987

president carlos menem says he 
will pardon 18 retired generals and admirals who face charges they 
committed hundreds of human rights abuses in the 1970s during the 
armed forces war on leftists 
the cases of six other people including two former presidents 
already convicted and sentenced will be considered at a later date 
menem said late sunday in a brief interview with staterun 
television 
menem who took office in july said ordered the pardon for the 
good of my country and due to the need for reconciliation to 
pacify argentina 
it is not possible to continue living in an ignominious past 
that wounds us all menem told channel 7 
menems statement was the first firm indication of who would be 
included in the controversial pardon expected to be formally 
announced after his return sept 28 from a visit to the united 
states 
this is getting worse and worse said hebe bonafini founder 
of the mothers of the plaza de mayo a group made up of relatives of 
people who disappeared during the 1970s all the military is 
responsible for what happened for the kidnappings the torture and 
the disappearances 
sixteen retired generals and two admirals face trial in civilian 
courts on hundreds of charges including kidnapping torture and 
murder growing out of a brutal campaign conducted against leftists 
during the 197683 military regime 
six others were convicted of similar charges in 1984 and are 
serving terms ranging from eight years to life at a military prison 
they are former military presidents gens jorge videla and 
roberto viola former navy commanders adms emilio massera and 
armando lambruschini and former buenos aires provincial police 
chiefs gens ramon camps and osvaldo riccheri 
a government commission named by menems predecessor former 
president raul alfonsin determined that at least 8900 argentines 
disappeared during the antisubversion campaign and were presumed 
dead 
human rights groups have accused the armed forces of genocide 
menem who took office july 8 made no reference to former 
leftist guerrilla leader mario firmenich now serving a 30year 
sentence for kidnapping and murder unconfirmed reports have 
indicated his case might be considered along with those of the 
convicted military men 
menem repeatedly has said he intends to resolve the military 
question before the end of the year and put an end to 
civilianmilitary tension stemming from the trials of officers 
but the possibility of a pardon has angered human rights groups 
who organized a sept 8 opposition march in buenos aires and other 
major cities 
government officials said monday the pardon also would include 
military officers facing disciplinary action for taking part in 
three insurrections in april 1987 and january and december 1988 
during the alfonsin presidency 
the revolts which were quelled with little bloodshed were aimed 
at ending the military trials 
the number of those officers facing action never has been 
announced but they are estimated to total about 100 including lt 
col aldo rico leader of the first two revolts and col mohamed 
ali seineldin who led the third

thunderstorms and heavy rains drenched 
northern california for a third day dashing hopes of a fruitful 
grape harvest in the regions wine country 
we were talking about a very large chardonnay crop this year 
we can forget about quantity now and well have to see about 
quality said andrew beckstoffer the biggest wine grape supplier 
in mendocino county with 2000 acres 
growers in napa sonoma and mendocino counties worked in the 
fields and hoped for sunshine as the sun broke through clouds monday 
afternoon after three days of rain the deluge drenched the 
vineyards threatening more than 11000 acres of grapes that can 
fetch about 1800 a ton or more 
wine producers were most concerned about the chardonnay and 
sauvignon blanc fruit which had been close to maturity before the 
storm the remnants of hurricane octave struck 
the growers hoped hot dry weather or at least cool and windy 
weather would help negate the effects of the rain the national 
weather service forecast fair and warmer weather today and warm dry 
weather the rest of the week 
theres going to be some rot even if the sun comes out now and 
everything turns out right said beckstoffer whose workers began 
pulling the leaves out of the bottom of the vines to help them dry 
faster the thing that scares me is that this rain might not 
end we might be in for the start of cold wet winter 
at sebastiani vineyards in sonoma vice president and executive 
winemaster doug davis said he could see some bunch rot already 
especially on the tissuepaper thin skin of chardonnay and sauvignon 
blanc grapes 
most of the approximately 190 vineyards in napa valley grow the 
threatened grapes champagne grapes which mature earlier escaped 
the damage red wine grapes harvested in october also were 
expected to be in good shape 
the cost of picking the white wine grapes is likely to soar 
because of the weather picking them selectively takes longer and 
could push labor costs from about 100 a ton per farm worker up to 
about 140 a ton 
alice and ray burch whose family has owned mallard winery inc 
in napa for five generations reserved helicopters to blow their 
crops dry when the rain stops they said this is the first time in 
more than 10 years that they have had to use helicopters to save a 
crop

the markets major concern was whether g7 group of seven

up its mind on what to do with its interest rates and the rising

the federal government puerto rican communities in the united 
states and voluntary relief agencies have started relief efforts to 
help communities struck by hurricane hugo 
the mobilization came as the storm lashed puerto rico after 
battering the us virgin islands and other tourist havens leaving 
at least 14 people dead and tens of thousands homeless 
us secretary of the interior manuel lujan attending a 
conference in honolulu with top officials of us territories in the 
pacific and caribbean said monday 500000 in emergency assistance 
funds have been released to aid the stormstricken areas 
lujan said he will leave hawaii wednesday night to return to 
washington to plan a tour of the devastation in the virgin islands 
gov rafael hernandezcolon of puerto rico said late monday that 
hugo left at least 27900 people homeless he said he would ask 
president bush to declare the island a disaster area 
in new york bank accounts hotlines and phoneathons are being 
set up by the citys puerto rican community to aid hurricane victims 
the department of puerto rican community affairs in the united 
states an organization run by the commonwealth of puerto rico 
began to coordinate disaster relief efforts by churches banks and 
individuals around the city 
i have my whole family there my mother my sister my 
friends my aunts my grandmother said ruth noemi colon a 
spokeswoman for the agency i talked to them last night i havent 
any information today you can tell how i feel im worried 
meanwhile an organization of voluntary relief agencies urged the 
public to donate cash rather than goods in an effort to avoid 
problems that have occurred during several past disasters when 
agencies were inundated with unneeded goods that hampered delivery 
of needed items 
for example people donated 1000 pairs of highheeled shoes to 
victims of a mexican earthquake while boots and wool sweaters were 
offered to jamaica after a hurricane last year and earthquake 
victims in peru got 7000 bras 
goods should not be collected or sent unless they have been 
requested by the disasterstricken country or private voluntary 
organizations said interaction a membership group of relief 
agencies 
when a need is identified following a disaster local american 
red cross chapters can help report which supplies are needed 
interaction suggested 
otherwise cash is the best way to make a contribution because 
relief workers can then purchase goods that are actually needed 
officials said 
interaction represents about 120 voluntary relief organizations 
including american red cross care save the children world vision 
oxfam and the christian childrens fund 
new yorkers with roots in puerto rico hoped for the best pilar 
alamo who has lived in the city for five years said she last spoke 
to her family sunday 
they had candles and a small gas stove and tried to board up a 
couple of glass windows said alamo whose siblings parents and 
grandparents live together in bayamon they live in a cement house 
but its always worse in the poorer communities where they live in

the contestant likely to be remembered in 
miss america pageant history as the one who got plunked on the head 
with a beer bottle said she detested the way pageant officials 
treated the women 
i hated being herded around with 50 other women said tamara 
toshiba marler miss oklahoma in an interview with the daily 
oklahoman on monday we were intelligent professional women and 
we were treated like little girls 
ms marler one of 10 finalists suffered a concussion when 
struck by the bottle during friday nights parade along atlantic 
city njs boardwalk 
she spent the night in the hospital but competed in saturday 
nights competition 
the pageant officials wouldnt even let me talk to the media

a businessman has been sentenced to 30 months 
in prison for conspiring to send iran deadly nerve gas which the 
prosecutor called a weapon of genocide 
juwhan yun 48 will serve no more than 22 months because us 
district judge h lee sarokin gave him credit for time served after 
the jan 12 arrest 
yun was convicted may 19 of conspiring to export arms illegally 
in his sentencing monday sarokin said the weapon the nerve gas 
sarin had the capability of inflicting massive casualties 
but the judge noted that there was no chance of the gas ever 
leaving the united states because yuns arms contact was in fact an 
undercover customs service agent 
he also said it was questionable whether yun ever would have 
committed a crime if the agent richard kennan had not intervened 
yun in addressing sarokin blamed kennan for his troubles 
i still believe i am victim of mr kennan for his achievement 
and advancement he said yun also accused the government of 
racism in targeting him a koreanamerican because of his heavy 
accent 
customs agents were tipped off by a former agent then working for 
a legitimate new york arms company who had been telephoned by yun 
regarding an ammunition deal 
yun who owned a trading company called komex international corp 
in summit conspired to ship 500 quarterton bombs to iran through a 
british arms dealer charles caplan 
i think we were outraged by the charge he was targeted because 
he was an oriental there was a good reason for starting this 
investigation said us attorney samuel a alito jr who called 
the sentence fair and appropriate 
defense attorney stephen dratch promised to appeal the conviction 
and sentence 
yun showed no reaction when sarokin announced the sentence but 
family members wept loudly in the hallway yuns elderly mother 
fell writhing to the ground yuns wife sat throughout with her eyes 
closed as she had during most of the cases proceedings 
assistant us attorney mark s olinsky called the gas the most 
heinous weapon or close to it in the history of mankind he 
noted it was developed by the nazis who experimented with it on 
concentration camp victims 
the substance is an odorless colorless poison that enters the 
body by inhalation absorption or injection and causes a painful 
death 
yun described himself as an honest businessman who emigrated to 
this country in 1972 seeking opportunity 
i came to the states for better education more to enjoy 
freedom and justice and to make money more honestly

allowed four of the five defendants to remain free on bail 
moses stewart father of 16yearold yusuf hawkins began yelling 
at the judge as he and hawkins mother diane hawkins stood to 
leave after mondays arraignment 
you handkerchiefheaded nigger stewart yelled at justice 
thaddeus owens you let murderers walk home free 
owens ordered officers to remove stewart who was already on his 
way out and muttered letting murderers walk home as the 
familys supporters were escorted from the court 
james patino 24 keith mondello 18 pasquale raucci 19 and 
joseph serrano 19 were freed on bail after pleading innocent to 
murder and other charges in the racial attack that occurred in their 
bensonhurst neighborhood 
about two hours after the pleas the fifth defendant and alleged 
triggerman joseph fama 18 pleaded innocent and was ordered back 
to jail without bail 
hawkins was shot to death aug 23 when he and three friends were 
surrounded by a gang of about 30 white youths the black teenagers

i saw joey fama pointing a gun and saw him shoot the gun three more 
times i saw the blue flash at the black i then saw the black fall 
to the ground 
mondello is out on 100000 bail and raucci is out on 75000 
bail 
the prosecutor said he was not legally able to ask for any change 
in their bail because the charges against them had not changed

in a hitandrun raid police rangers 
flown in by us helicopters and accompanied by a us adviser blew 
up an airstrip used by cocaine smugglers in an eastern jungle 
mondays raid was witnessed by the first reporters allowed onto a 
new usbuilt antinarcotics base in santa lucia since it began 
operating sept 8 beside the huallaga river in the heart of perus 
cocaproducing region 
antidrug police in four huey helicopters flown by american 
contract pilots swooped in on a 1500yard dirt airstrip carved into 
the jungle a hundred yards from the huallaga 
the rangers quickly set off plastic explosives that left two 
craters 20 feet in diameter and 12 feet deep in the runway within 
10 minutes the helicopters were airborne again 
speed is the key to safety we have to come in quickly and get 
out quickly said gen juan zarate chief of the national 
antidrug police force who led the group 
he was referring to the maoist shining path guerrillas who 
dominate the upper huallaga valley and provide protection to coca 
farmers and drug trafficking gangs in return for cash 
the four hueys used in the raid along with four others on loan 
to peru are armed with m60 machine guns and carry gunners at the 
door on alert for attack from the jungle 
us drug enforcement administration agents usually accompany the 
police rangers on raids but only one was spotted in mondays attack 
and reporters were not allowed to talk to him 
the burly agent dressed in jungle fatigues and carrying an 
assault rifle looked on as police troopers exploded the charges on 
the landing strip he wore a handkerchief over his face to hide his 
identity while photos were taken 
the heavily fortified garrison in santa lucia is the centerpiece 
of the us governments increasingly militarized campaign against 
the drug trade in peru which produces nearly 70 percent of the 
worlds coca leaf the source of cocaine 
the antidrug base 150 miles northeast of the capital lima 
eventually will contain at least 300 police troopers they will 
receive training and air support from up to 50 americans including 
dea agents and contracted pilots 
president bush recently announced 261 million for military and 
policeaction aid to fight cocaine trafficking in colombia peru and 
bolivia the three countries this year received 57 million 
after blowing up the airstrip the airborne rangers continued on 
to a cocaine base lab discovered friday in a bamboo forest near the 
village of ramal de aspuzana and later dynamited and burned by 
police 
as zarate showed journalists around the dynamited buildings he 
pointed out destroyed barrels and dryers that he said turned out 660 
pouds of cocaine base a week worth 12 million 
cocaine base the final refining stage before pure cocaine and 
coca paste a more elementary stage are sold to colombian drug 
smugglers who arrive at dozens of airstrips scattered through the 
highland jungle of the huallaga valley 
the colombian cartels turn the paste and base into pure cocaine 
and smuggle it to the united states and europe 
about 200 police rangers have begun operating out of the santa 
lucia base and have destroyed seven laboratories in five days 
zarate said 
bulldozers at the base were still working monday on the airstrip 
now 1800 yards long but designed to reach 2500 yards big enough 
to handle jumbo c130 cargo planes 
guard towers 30 feet high provide a view out over the river and 
the jungle which has been cut back hundreds of yards from the 
perimeter of the base 
sixfoothigh sandbag barricades protect four helicopter pads 
the base not including the airstrip covers 100 acres and is closed 
in by barbed wire the outlying area is mined 
the shining path is going to lose hundreds of men if it tries 
to attack this base said a us official involved in the war 
against the cocaine trade

beach boys founder brian wilson filed a 100 
million civil suit to recover copyrights to songs that his father 
sold to aampm records and an affiliate for 700000 in 1969 
the superior court suit monday charges irving music and aampm with 
fraud and wilsons former attorneys mitchell silberberg amp knupp of 
los angeles with legal malpractice in connection with the sale 
it seeks more than 50 million in compensatory damages the 
amount wilson alleged aampm earned in publishing royalties from the 
songs he authored and recorded with the beach boys and 50 million 
in punitive damages said wilsons attorney james p tierney 
brian wilson was an established writer in 1962 at the age of 
19 tierney said a performer who has hit songs does not 
transfer all publishing rights to his future songs to a publishing 
company for no consideration 
the suit covers publishing rights to up to 200 songs recorded by 
the beach boys before 1969 tierney said among them surfin 
usa help me rhonda good vibrations and california 
girls 
a spokeswoman at aampm said monday the firm and its affiliate would 
have no comment on the suit attorneys at mitchell silberberg amp 
knupp could not be reached for comment in repeated telephone calls 
to their offices 
the suit contends that 
wilson was unable to assert his rights to the songs because of 
his drug and alcohol abuse and psychological illness the suit 
claims the diagnosis of paranoid psychosis that still affects the 
singer stemmed from childhood abuse by his father murry wilson 
tierney said 
murry wilson sold the songs because he was upset over his firing 
as the bands manager in 1964 tierney said in an interview brian 
wilsons attorneys aware of their clients condition never advised 
him of his right to assert ownership to the songs tierney said 
in 1962 the year he formed the beach boys wilson verbally 
agreed to allow his father murry wilson administrative control of 
his songs with brian retaining 100 percent ownership tierney said 
murry wilson set up sea of tunes publishing co to administer the 
songs in 1969 upset over his firing as the bands manager five 
years earlier murry wilson sold his sons publishing rights to the 
songs to irving music for 700000 tierney said 
brian never saw a penny of it he said 
murry wilson died in 1973

two antigun organizations sought 
grassroots support for stricter gun laws as the death toll from a 
shooting rampage at a printing plant rose to nine 
kenneth fentress 45 died monday afternoon said a spokeswoman 
at humana hospital university fentress suffered gunshot wounds to 
the chest and leg during last thursdays rampage 
the plant worker was one of 13 wounded when joseph t wesbecker 
sprayed the standard gravure corp with gunfire from an ak47 rifle 
wesbecker who then killed himself had been on permanent disability 
leave from the plant for the past year because of mental illness 
in a fullpage ad monday in the courierjournal the louisville 
council on peacemaking and religion called for the abolition of 
assault weapons saying it felt compelled to say enough is 
enough 
the group said that society shares part of the blame for allowing 
the assault weapons to be sold legally 
the blame can no longer be placed solely on the psychologically 
disturbed individuals who find ways to acquire these deadly weapons 
and who use them with such abandon the ad said the accomplice 
to the crime is the legality of their acquisition 
pat mccuen codirector of the council said the ad was an 
exercise in grassroots democracy 
most peole are starting to feel like theyre under siege the 
united states is starting to look like a war zone 
also monday handgun control inc placed a threequarters page ad 
in the louisville newspaper featuring sarah brady wife of former 
presidential press secretary james brady who was injured in the 
attempted assassination of president reagan in 1981 
the ad sought contributions to finance lobbying efforts for 
sensible effective gun laws 
this is your chance to break the gun lobbys death grip on 
congress mrs brady said in the ad together we can beat the 
national rifle association and keep handguns out of the wrong 
hands 
william smith nra representative of the kentucky league of 
sportsmen said legislation to ban weapons would not prevent similar 
attacks 
you cant legislate against a nut he said 
the gun shop owner in louisville who sold wesbecker the ak47 and 
a mac11 pistol said he had decided to quit special ordering the 
semiautomatic weapons for customers 
the weapons are so controversial right now that we just dont 
want to fool with them any longer said jack tilford owner of 
tilfords gun sales

small metal fatigue cracks 
found in the rear wing joints of more than a third of the air 
forces aging c141 transport planes have sent the fleet in for 
inspections and repairs 
it is the second time in two years that wing cracks forced the 
air force to restrict flights of its workhorse starlifters 
which are repaired at robins air force base 
the cracks were discovered by robins inspectors last month and 
led the military airlift command to order checks of its 266 c141s 
some of which are delivering military supplies to colombia for the 
push against drug kingpins 
all of the c141s are more than 22 years old 
as of monday cracks had been discovered on 79 of 204 planes 
inspected said capt tom dolney a spokesman for mac headquarters 
at scott air force base near belleville ill 
sixtyfour of the planes have been repaired and returned to 
service 
dolney said the restrictions have not affected operations 
military airlift command also flies c5 and c130 transport 
planes 
the cracks range in length from oneeighth of an inch to 1 
inches they have been found on rear wing joints that connect the 
inner and outer portions of the planes 159foot wings 
cracks were predicted to occur in this area however they were 
discovered sooner than anticipated said robins spokesman dale 
brinkman 
last year the air force grounded and inspected its starlifter 
fleet because of extensive corrosion and cracks in center wing 
structures 
the plane was originally designed by the lockheed georgia co for 
a lifetime of 30000 flying hours most already have flown more than 
29000 hours

a section of roof over a ymca swimming pool 
collapsed on a preschool swimming class while horrified parents 
watched and seven children and a lifeguard were injured 
authorities said they didnt know what caused chunks of concrete 
tar and roofing stone to cascade into the pool monday 
we were looking through a picture window down the other end 
and then the whole roof over the shallow end just came down in one 
piece said john welch whose son michael was not injured in the 
accident 
the collapse left a jagged 20by15 foot hole in the roof of the 
brick building 
lifeguard david bortolotto 18 who was hit in the head by a 
piece of debris and ellenmarie joyce the aquatic programs 
director rushed to rescue the children aged 3 to 6 from the pool 
police superintendent gerard mchale called bortolotto a real 
superstar he collapsed after he got the kids out 
bortolotto and swimming student tracey blasenheim 4 were the 
most seriously injured bortolotto was in stable condition and 
blasenheim was in serious condition with a depressed skull fracture 
and abdominal injuries 
stuart e robbins the west roxbury ymca treasurer said moisture 
and humidity in the pool area may have weakened the concrete roof 
decking and possibly led to the collapse 
he said the roof was inspected in 1984 and 1987 another section 
of the building was inspected this summer after rainwater was found 
to be leaking from the ceiling into an office

a judge said pulitzer prizewinning journalist 
seymour hersh does not have to reveal his sources for now for a book 
that said former indian prime minister moraji desai was a paid cia 
informant 
the jury monday watched a videotape of desai who has sued hersh 
for libel in which he denied knowing any cia agents 
the deposition was taped during visits by desai to chicago in 
1984 and 1985 desai 94 was too ill to travel from india to 
chicago to testify said his lawyer cyriac kappil 
desai filed a lawsuit almost six years ago seeking 100 million 
in damages against hersh claiming that he was libeled in the 
journalists 1983 book the price of power about former us 
secretary of state henry kissinger in one of the books chapters 
hersh wrote that desai had served as a paid informant for the cia 
the lawsuit was filed in chicago in accordance with the tradition 
of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the defendant hersh 
was born in chicago but now lives in washington dc 
hersh was expected to be called to testify later this week 
us district judge charles norgle denied a motion by kappil to 
force hersh to reveal the unnamed sources he cited in the book but 
he said there may come a time in the trial when it might be 
necessary to disclose the names of the sources 
in his opening statement kappil said hershs book implied that 
desai was a traitor to his government and contained false 
statements 
he wrote a book to sell kappil said as is sometimes the 
case to sell a book they like to put a little curry a little 
flavor in it 
bernard nussbaum an attorney for hersh said the author had six 
independent sources who claimed desai a bitter enemy of former 
prime minister indira gandhi received 20000 a year as a cia 
informant 
the lawyer said the indian politician cooperated with the cia 
because he was opposed to ms gandhis close relations with the 
soviet union and her preparations for the 1971 war with pakistan 
he tended to oppose whatever she wanted nussbaum said 
here were two bareknuckled indian politicians who make chicago 
look like a rose garden 
desai served as prime minister from 197780 after his janata 
coalition swept ms gandhis new congress party from power 
in us libel cases involving a public figure the plaintiff must 
prove that the defendant knew that what he was printing was false 
negligent or malicious 
hersh won the pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1970 
for his articles exposing the my lai massacre in vietnam when he 
was a reporter for the dispatch news service he was also a reporter

the city held its first districtonly primary 
elections today after officials approved a settlement in a voters 
rights lawsuit 
the city council decision monday evening ended a yearlong legal 
battle and negotiations with lawyers representing black and hispanic 
voters in the federal classaction suit 
at last weve resolved it mayor maureen oconnor said i 
think it is a fair compromise and i am pleased the election will 
proceed i hope everybody goes out and votes 
voters approved districtonly elections last year todays 
primary in four of the citys eight council districts is the first 
election since then 
the lawsuit contended the voting power of minorities in san diego 
was diluted unconstitutionally by a citywide council election 
system 
terms of the settlement require june 1990 ballot initiatives on 
redistricting the city and on increasing the size of council from 
eight to 10 seats 
this increases the opportunity for minorities to elect who they 
want to elect and it increases the opportunity for minorities to 
get elected said jess haro of the chicano federation which filed 
the lawsuit

japan has notified countries in the south pacific 
that it will cut driftnet fishing fleets to onethird of last years 
record level in the tunarich area officials said today 
fifteen countries in the south pacific forum demanded in july 
that japan and taiwan entirely ban fishing with the enormous nets 
calling it indiscriminate irresponsible and destructive 
japan said then it would continue to permit driftnet fishing for 
two years while researching its effect on fish stocks which 
fisheries experts in the region said could be depleted within two 
years taiwan has not responded to the demands to end driftnet 
fishing in the south pacific 
today japans foreign ministry said the fishery agency notified 
southern pacific countries including australia new zealand and fiji 
that japan is to reduce the number of driftnet vessels in the season 
starting in november to a maximum of 20 per year the level before 
the number shot up to about 60 driftnetters 
fishing with driftnets which are also called gillnets is 
strongly disputed in the north pacific as well 
the united states has negotiated with japan south korea and 
taiwan to limit and monitor use of the long nets which 
environmentalists call walls of death because they snare all 
kinds of marine life 
driftnet fishing uses nets up to 50 miles long it has been 
condemned as strip mining of the seas and blamed for the destruction 
of sea mammals birds and fish other than the target southern 
albacore tuna 
the united states has complained that driftnet fishing in 
unauthorized north pacific waters was hurting salmon runs in alaska 
washington state and oregon 
during the 198889 fishing year the 60 japanese driftnet vessels 
in the south pacific caught some 10000 tons of tuna said a foreign 
ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in comparison australia caught just 200 to 400 tons by 
poleandline fishing new zealand 5200 tons by trawling and the 
united states fetched 3700 tons the official added 
kentaro iwasa spokesman for an association of poleandline tuna 
fishers said the governments decision should be a step toward 
eliminating driftnet fishing 
some of our fishing boats got into trouble when the boats 
propeller got caught in a driftnet where driftnet fishing was 
prohibited he said weve been urging driftnet fishers and the 
government that hazardous driftnet fishing should be eliminated 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told reporters that 
each driftnet vessel will have to report its catch 
japan will send a patrol vessel to police japanese driftnetters 
and a research vessel to the tasman sea between australia and new 
zealand for biological research he said one representative from 
the region can participate in the research team as an observer

messing up the sex lives of their fertile relatives 
state officials aboard slowly moving flatbed trucks monday

theres almost no possibility that two fertile flies will meet and 
mate said state entomologist gary agosta 
twentythree wild medflies have been found since aug 31 on 
sept 8 helicopters sprayed mountain view sunnyvale and los altos 
in northern california but medfly maggots inside fruit and in the

retiring surgeon general c everett koop is 
urging that the new national aids commission try to turn around the 
meanspiritedness some americans show towards people with aids 
and the outspoken physician suggests that those who act hatefully 
toward victims of the incurable disease should be treated in the 
same way by society 
you could isolate the meanspirited people in this country and 
if the rest of society could treat them with the same repugnance 
that those people treat persons with aids i think that should be 
your goal koop told the commission monday 
koop who has sought to heighten awareness about aids during his 
tenure as the nations top health adviser also said the government 
must find a better way to reach teenagers who are ignoring aids 
warnings 
we know that sexual activity is rampant and that people of the 
group im talking about are not listening to us he said 
koop spoke to the national commission on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome as it held its first day of testimony from 
experts including researchers advocates and aids patients the 
panel was created by congress last year to advise the president and 
capitol hill on aids issues 
the latest figures from the federal centers for disease control 
there are 105990 americans diagnosed as having aids of those 60 
percent are homosexual or bisexual males and 20 percent are 
intravenous drug users 
koop caused an uproar with his october 1986 report on aids in 
which he advocated sex education for young children i still 
believe in that very firmly he told the commission 
parents he said should be joining with and not fighting the 
schools in getting this done and getting it done properly 
i do believe if we taught sexuality in kind loving 
compassionate caring ways in a family context that we could raise a 
generation of teenagers to be less sexually active than the ones we 
have today he said 
the panel which met for the first time last month will take up 
the work of an earlier aids commission formed by president reagan 
and chaired by adm james watkins that panel called for a major 
escalation of federal efforts to treat cure and prevent aids and 
for legislation to protect victims from discrimination 
commission member belinda mason a 30yearold mother of two who 
contracted aids through a blood transfusion said the panel can make 
a difference in the lives of people with aids 
we all want nothing more and nothing less than what all of you 
take for granted today a place to live the right to have a job 
decent medical care and to lead their lives without invisible 
barriers she said 
she said she would like to see the commission work for federal 
protections against discrimination for people with aids and for 
policies that get expensive drug treatments to those who need them 
compassion isnt going to happen because of a report we make or 
an edict that somebody in washington delivers she said itll 
begin in the small towns and quiet country throughout america where 
people who live with aids and hiv infection are just like us 
because they are us

controversy about an obscene gesture he made to hecklers but a 
member of his committee to improve the capital citys image says 
it doesnt bode well

members of a crowd at an outdoor festival 
smiling the mayor made an obscene finger gesture the incident

voters of washington dc elected me to do barry said monday in 
a written statement 
arthur j schultz a local public relations executive and member 
of the mayors committee to improve the citys image said barrys 
reaction would be normal for many people but not for a mayor

nationally it doesnt bode well schultz said

a landlord whose rooming house was 
gutted in a fire that killed eight tenants has been convicted of 
criminally negligent homicide for code violations that included a 
door locked with a key from the inside 
two tenants were found dead at the door in the jan 15 blaze in 
yonkers 
supreme court justice nicholas colabella on monday convicted 
frank thomas on two counts of criminally negligent homicide and 
acquitted the 67yearold landlord on five others an eighth count 
was dismissed earlier 
it was believed to be the first time in westchester county that a 
landlord was held liable for a death because of failure to comply 
with safety codes thomas could receive one and onethird to four 
years in prison on each count at sentencing nov 2 
thomas who lives in new rochelle had been charged with the 
eight deaths because of fire code violations that included a missing 
fire door and a dead bolt on the front door that required a key from 
the inside to unlock 
he was convicted in the deaths of the two men ages 52 and 61 
who were found at the locked door of the fourstory building 
investigators said the fire started in the basement and was 
caused by careless smoking by a drunken resident the resident died 
in the blaze 
defense attorney neal comer said the lack of case law on landlord 
liability made an appeal absolutely necessary 
comer had argued that the special lock had been requested by 
tenants worried about the drug addicts hanging out on the steps he 
had also noted that several tenants had been drunk and said that 
contributed to their inability to get out 
district attorney carl vergaris office seized records of city 
agencies to determine why full inspections had not been done in as 
much as a decade

the permit process imposed on pueblo 
indians seeking eagle feathers for religious rites is 
unconstitutional a federal judge ruled 
the process constitutes excessive entanglement with the 
religious tenets of those tribes and is therefore an invalid mixture 
of church and state us district judge john conway ruled friday 
eagle feathers are available to pueblos only by applying to a 
depository maintained by the us fish and wildlife service 
conways ruling came in the case of mark suazo hinds a pueblo 
charged in the purchase of a golden eagle for 500 that he resold to 
a cousin the case stems from a fish and wildlife service sting that 
netted hundreds of arrests in colorado and new mexico in january 
the most significant thing to me in the opinion is that this 
court has recognized that indian religious practices are entitled to 
just as much protection as anybody elses religion said defense 
attorney john boyd 
us attorney bill lutz said he is unsure whether he will appeal 
but he said theres no question that the transfer of the eagle 
was for money and we dont think indian religious freedom was an 
issue 
hinds says he sold the eagle at no profit to his cousin who 
needed it after he was to be initiated into a pueblo religious 
society the cousin tried for two years to get an eagle through the 
federal depository the defense argued 
the prosecution contended that hinds bought the eagle to make a 
fetish for a nonindian psychiatrist for several thousand dollars 
but the judge ruled that the prosecution failed to establish any 
motive other than religious convictions 
the judge also noted that pueblos whose applications are granted 
get frozen eagles that often are killed by nonindians in an 
unspecified manner some indian rituals forbid use of a dead eagle 
others designate how the eagle should be killed he said 
alfonso ortiz a pueblo anthropologist testified at a hearing 
that pueblo religion would wither away without eagle feathers 
but that the plumes are available only through a cumbersome and 
intrusive process 
the federal depository has a special problem because one may 
apply but one never knows when or even if youll get the feathers 
you need he said its very sad that pueblo peoples who still 
practice their traditional religion have to rely on such a system

with hurricane hugo heading toward the us mainland cruise 
lines emptied their ships of passengers and hauled tail out of 
port florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurance 
companies for financial protection 
the eastern caribbeans strongest storm in 10 years churned 
toward the bahamas today after scouring puerto rico with 125 mph 
winds leaving tens of thousands of people homeless 
early computer predictions indicated the storm was likely to hit 
the east coast late in the week and officials told coastal 
residents to familiarize themselves with emergency procedures 
hurricane hugo has the potential of being the worst storm to 
affect the southeast coast since david hit the georgiasouth 
carolina coast in 1979 said john purvis director of the 
southeast regional climate center in columbia sc 
workers at the kennedy space center at cape canaveral fla 
began preparing to roll the space shuttle atlantis from its launch 
pad into a building in case hugo comes too close 
in addition nasa decided to drain the fuel from an atlascentaur 
rocket carrying a navy satellite postponing the launch from friday 
to at least sunday 
preparations were being made to remove the satellite but nasa 
said today that no decision on moving it or the shuttle would be 
made until wednesday 
cruise lines in san juan puerto rico quickly unloaded 
passengers changed itineraries and sent passengerless liners out to 
sea after hugos winds began to rake the island sunday morning 
we hauled tail and got out of there said rich steck a 
spokesman for royal caribbean cruise lines which canceled this 
weeks trip on the sun viking and ended last weeks tour a day 
early bringing 444 passengers into san juan on saturday 
as soon as the people were off we took out to sea with just 
crew on board steck said in miami ships are built to ride in 
rough water its natural element is the sea well just go as far as 
we can get from it and then turn around and face it 
royal caribbean offered passengers on the canceled trip free 
tickets and 200 spending money on a later cruise steck said 
carnival cruise lines diverted the celebration which which 
normally carries up to 1800 passengers on weeklong trips through 
san juan st thomas and the eastern caribbean toward jamaica and 
mexico 
carnival was watching hugos development closely before deciding 
whether to divert the carnivale which left miami on monday with 
about 1000 passengers on a fourday trip to the bahamas spokesman 
tim gallagher said 
days before possible hurricane watches or warnings for the miami 
area some insurance agents already have issued a warning of their 
own its now too late to get flood insurance protection for hugo 
if someone comes in and wants to add flood insurance theres a 
fiveday waiting period said james berhardt a state farm agent 
agents for other companies said the hurricane was fast 
approaching the point beyond which they would issue no more 
increases in property insurance 
independent agent john handeman of south miami said once any 
hurricane crosses 15 degrees north latitude and 72 degrees west 
latitude he wont sell homeowners increased coverage miami is at 
about 80 degrees west longitude 
early today hugos center already had passed the threshold 
at 2 am edt its center was near 207 degrees north latitude 
and 673 degrees west longitude moving north northwest at 12 mph 
national aeronautics and space administration officials were 
hoping hugo would give them enough warning before bringing high 
winds to the launch site at cape canaveral 
according to nasas contingency plan officials will order a 
rollback of the atlantis if they receive a forecast that 
hurricaneforce winds will arrive at the cape within 72 hours 
by monday night the national weather service estimated there was 
only an 8 percent chance that hurricane force winds would hit cape 
canaveral before thursday evening 
but because the shuttle can move at only 1 mph the journey back 
to the assembly building takes six hours leaving little room for 
error 
nasa said that if caught by high winds it could secure the 
shuttle and its cargo the nuclearpowered galileo space probe on 
the launch pad to ride out any storm 
a return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the 
scheduled oct 12 launch of atlantis but nasa has until late 
november to send the probe on its sixyear voyage to the planet

united mine workers on monday for a variety of violations in july 
and august during the strike begun against pittston in april he 
also barred union members and supporters from impeding pittston

spokesman charlie vaughan said until something develops were 
just observing and hoping nothing gets out of hand vaughan said 
pittstons 1695 umw employees from virginia west virginia and 
kentucky are involved in the strike which has become a cause for 
organized labor across the country because the workers believe 
pittston is trying to break the union

federal judges for illegal demonstrations and acts of violence 
against company property and employees 
late monday the national labor relations board filed court 
papers to have the sitin declared unlawful a court official said

paul douglas to come to the bargaining table and as a statement 
against unfair labor laws union officials said 
negotiations have been stalled for six weeks and no talks are 
scheduled

president bush accusing the soviet union 
of interfering in the western hemisphere by sending arms to 
nicaragua says hes not ready to set a date for a summit meeting 
with soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
i feel under no rush on that subject bush told reporters 
monday at a news conference in helena mont before flying here for 
the night 
the president on a twoday tour of western states celebrating 
their 100th anniversary also said he was not about to be pressured 
on the issue of arms control by reports of a new soviet proposal 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze is expected to meet with 
bush at the white house on thursday before shevardnadzes meeting 
beginning the following day in jackson hole wyo with secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
bush conceded he had heard but could not personally confirm 
speculation that shevardnadze would bring with him a new proposal 
for limiting longrange nuclear missiles 
however bush said were not going to just react to his 
proposals were going to be very interested and welcome them but 
we just simply cannot and will not keep reacting 
bush denied he was dragging his feet on entering negotiations 
with the soviets on limiting ballistic missiles although he 
conceded this might be the perception because had focused attention 
earlier in his administration into getting conventional force 
stability in europe 
asked about a summit with gorbachev bush said he first wanted to 
await results of the bakershevardnadze meeting a superpower summit 
is expected to be one issue on the agenda 
suggesting that soviet intentions still leave a lot to be 
desired bush said we have interests in this hemisphere where the 
soviets are continuing to send increased amounts of arms going 
into nicaragua right now over last year thats not very good 
thats not a very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere 
senate majority leader george mitchell said monday that the bush 
administration has reacted timidly to events in eastern europe and 
should actively support the forces of democratic change in the 
communist world 
he called on bush to support the entry of communist nations into 
western economic institutions once their internal reforms merit 
such participation 
now is the time for the united states to encourage and 
capitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long mitchell 
said in a senate speech the administrations timidity in the face 
of these opportunities is puzzling and dismaying instead of 
encouragement and engagment the administration has adopted an 
almost passive stance 
on another issue involving latin america bush said he did not 
fear for his safety or for that of his family because of reported 
death threats from colombian drug lords saying he had confidence in 
the secret service 
he said there was no hard intelligence evidence of the 
targeting of his family or of any other americans by drug interests 
in colombia 
but clearly any such action would i think just bring down 
the total wrath of the american people and the american 
government he said 
on another topic bush said he was not ready to restore normal 
relations with the peoples republic of china saying there has been 
little apparent change in that governments attitudes since chinese 
troops fired on unarmed demonstrators in beijings tiananmen square 
last spring 
its not a time for total normalcy bush said 
his administration announced on monday it intends to give 
mostfavorednation trade status to hungary bush praised hungarys 
communist government at his news conference for allowing thousands 
of east germans to flock across its borders en route to freedom in 
west germany 
asked whether he favors the reunification of germany bush said 
i would think its a matter for the germans to decide 
but he added if that reunification was worked out between 
the germanys i do not think we should view that as bad for western 
interests 
bush returning to soviet issues said he was not ready to relax 
trade restrictions on the soviet union like he is doing for hungary 
he said that despite some reported progress the soviet union 
still is not permitting free emigration of soviet jews and other 
minorities 
i think things are improving but i think as long as someone is 
held in a country against their will because they cant get out it 
is a matter of human concern bush said

kissinger and japans former prime minister kakuei tanaka all three 
men led the way in improving their countries relations with china 
the meeting at the great hall of the people was the second for 
chinas reclusive leader in three days 
on saturday deng appeared in public for the first time in three 
months when he held talks with chineseamerican physicist td lee 
dengs reemergence after the long absence has for the moment 
dispelled speculation that he is gravely ill with cancer and may not 
have long to live 
the nationally televised evening news showed deng walking unaided 
to meet ito whom he called an old friend as the two shook hands 
ito who heads japans parliamentarians league for japanchina 
friendship opened the meeting by commenting that deng appeared to 
be in the same good health as when they met a year ago despite 
reports that he was seriously ill 
deng replied that the foreign mass media had already declared him 
dead or very sick such reports caused the hong kong stock market to 
fall he said adding that the market had recovered when he 
reappeared saturday with lee a nobel prizewinning physicist 
in reality i have always been healthy deng said 
yoshiro hayashi a japanese lawmaker and member of the 
delegation provided details of the meeting to the japanese press 
deng praised the high political consciousness of nixon 
kissinger and tanaka who helped bring about the normalization of 
relations with china even though china was then in the throes of the 
leftist cultural revolution 
kissinger then national security adviser made a secret trip to 
beijing in 1971 to set the stage for nixons dramatic visit in 
february 1972 
tanaka who like nixon was later to be forced out of office by 
scandal traveled to china in september 1972 to normalize relations 
between the two countries 
drawing an apparent comparison with the leaders of the west 
today deng criticized the participants of the recent sevennation 
summit of industrialized nations in paris for calling on china to 
cease its crackdown on those who sought democratic reforms 
he also said japans attitude has been different from that of the 
united states which has been vocal in calling for china to end its 
suppression of dissent and ensure the human rights of its citizens 
japan like the united states has curtailed highlevel official 
contacts and suspended talks on new loans since the army killed 
hundreds of unarmed civilians june 34 in clearing central beijing 
of prodemocracy protesters 
but japan has also muffled its public criticisms of the chinese 
governments actions 
deng stressed the importance of chinas relations with its 
biggest trading partner outside hong kong and said ties should 
continue despite chinas recent domestic turmoil 
ito the highestlevel japanese official to visit china since 
june said the june events had put a damper on relations between the 
two countries and his mission was to find out how these problems 
could be overcome 
since arriving sunday ito has also met with premier li peng 
communist party general secretary jiang zemin and other top leaders 
he was to return to japan later today 
on saturday deng said the crushed prodemocracy movement has 
taught us a major lesson after the turmoil all of us have 
become soberminded 
deng stressed chinas commitment to the marketoriented reforms 
he initiated 10 years ago but added that some officials did not 
pay enough attention to ideological and political developments 
it was an apparent reference to ousted party chief zhao ziyang 
who has been accused of encouraging bourgeois liberalization or 
acceptance of western liberal ideas in pushing ahead with rapid 
reform without duly considering ideological matters

forecasters today said deadly hurricane hugo could 
hit anywhere from florida to north carolina this weekend or spin 
harmlessly away in the atlantic 
its a long way from any potential landfall said bob sheets 
director of the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
unfortunately the higher likelihood is that it will turn more 
west and could make landfall anywhere from south florida to north 
carolina 
sheets added though that its also possible the hurricane could 
skirt the united states entirely 
forecasters today watched data spit out of computers studied 
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on air force 
hurricane hunter planes and even pulled out old hurricane 
charts to see what storms similar to hugo have done 
the data laid out conflicting futures for hugo sheets said 
we were just looking through a bunch of the old charts he 
said theyve done everything theyve done loopityloops theyve 
gone into south florida theyve gone into central florida all the 
way up to the carolinas 
the main area of agreement on the computer models sheets said 
was that hugo is likely to change from the northnorthwest course it 
followed overnight after pounding puerto rico 
now the question is when is it going to turn more 
westnorthwest sheets said theres just not any way to say 
hurricanes are propelled by prevailing winds generated by other 
weather systems 
the most likely impact on hugo will be a bermuda high a 
highpressure system building to hugos northeast forecasters said 
that system would tend to keep hugo from veering from the east coast

pilots of united airlines flight 232 disagreed 
over how best to control their crippled airliner seconds before it 
crashlanded at an iowa airport according to a transcript of 
cockpit conversation 
the transcript shows capt albert haynes of united flight 232 
called for left turns right turns and a cut in power within the 
final 20 seconds before the dc10 cartwheeled and exploded in flames 
at sioux city on july 19 killing 112 people 
but trainer pilot dennis fitch told haynes that closing the 
throttles would take away the ability to steer the plane according 
to the transcript released monday by the national transportation 
safety board a report accompanying the transcript said fitch 
believes he added power just prior to contact with the ground 
haynes fitch and two other pilots in the cockpit have been 
widely praised for bringing the jetliner down with no greater loss 
of life after one of its three engines exploded severing all 
hydraulic flight controls 
the cockpit crew and 180 people survived the crash 
the transcript shows that just 15 seconds before impact haynes 
and first officer william r records called for fitch to close 
off both throttles 
but fitch who had been called into the cockpit from the 
passenger section to assist the airliners threeman crew replied 
nah i cant pull em off or well lose it thats whats turnin 
ya 
fitch had been steering the plane by selectively applying power 
to its two wing engines after its tailmounted third engine 
apparently threw out parts that severed hydraulic lines in its tail 
the dc10s builder mcdonnell douglas last week announced 
changes in the design of its planes hydraulic systems that james b 
busey head of the federal aviation administration said would 
ensure similar hydraulic failure would not occur again 
john m martin inspector for the faa assisting in the ntsb 
investigation said the planes remaining two engines were operating 
when it hit he said there were no apparent conflicts in statements 
flight crew members made to investigators about the landing but 
acknowledged there was disagreement in the flights final seconds 
over cutting back power 
haynes order to close off the throttles was to put the 
engines in idle not to shut them down completely martin said 
the cockpit tape on a loop that records over itself after about 
a halfhour covers only the final 33 minutes and 34 seconds of the 
flight the tape does not include the sound of the engine failure on 
the denverchicago flight or pilot conversation over the next 10 
minutes 
the safety board last month released transcripts of the planes 
communication with the ground but had not previously included 
sounds picked up by the cockpit microphone 
ease the power back haynes told fitch a few seconds before 
impact 
maybe you can pull em all the way off suggested first 
officer william r records 
haynes then called for left turns and said close the 
throttles after a few seconds he called for a right turn and 
again said close the throttles 
but fitch declined 
the board provided no analysis of the taped conversation which 
will be used in its continuing investigation into the crash 
a report accompanying the transcript noted there was constant 
discussion among crew members on the best course of action to take 
during the flight 
the transcript shows they discussed whether to lower the landing 
gear and later disagreed about when the wheel door was opened 
at one point the captain said anybody got any idea about 
puttin the gear down right now 
another crew member identified tentatively as fitch later said 
dammit i wish we hadnt put that gear down 
about four minutes before the crash landing haynes gave rapid 
back and forward commands and then said wont this be a 
fun landing

the justice department said today its criminal 
division is reviewing records of the longrunning congressional 
investigation into influence peddling at the department of housing 
and urban development 
the records of the house subcommittee are being reviewed 
closely as a part of the hud matter said david runkel the 
departments chief spokesman 
he said the review began earlier this summer and is being 
conducted by the fraud and public integrity sections of the criminal 
division 
runkel rejected calls from several lawmakers that the justice 
department seek court appointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate allegations of wrongdoing at hud 
investigations are proceeding in us attorneys offices around 
the country and there is no reason to believe these cannot be 
handled by the us attorneys runkel said attorney general dick 
thornburgh has made it clear he wants these cases given high 
priority the spokesman added 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing has heard allegations of influence peddling during the 
reagan administration to obtain highlevel approval of hud financing 
for development projects 
the panel has also heard conflicting testimony about the role of 
former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr in the awarding of hud 
grants to politically connected developers 
pierce has denied allegations that he helped political friends 
get hud grants the panel has heard testimony contradicting pierces 
denials and has called him back for more questioning on the matter 
the public integrity section earlier had reviewed a hud inspector 
generals report that found broad instances of lobbying of top hud 
officials by developers the prosecutors made a preliminary 
conclusion that the report had uncovered no instances of wrongdoing 
hud officials meanwhile asked congress monday to reverse a 
court decision they say could cost the government more than the 2 
billion pricetag put on past agency abuses 
the request came at a senate banking committee hearing at which 
deputies to hud secretary jack kemp also promised to permanently 
flush politics out of the selection process for huds abuseriddled 
section 8 moderate rehabilitation program 
it was the first hudrelated hearing by the senate panel since 
congress returned earlier this month from a monthlong recess 
chairman donald riegle dmich said the panel planned to call 
all of the major players in the reaganera abuses at hud an 
indication the senate would seek to match an exhaustive 
investigation being conducted by a house subcommittee 
during prior testimony kemp agreed with a congressmans 2 
billion ballpark estimate of the cost to taxpayers of the 
influncepeddling fraud and mismanagement in hud programs during 
the eightyear tenure of pierce 
james logue the agencys general assistance secretary for 
multifamily housing said a recent decision by the ninth circuit 
court of appeals in san francisco could cost hud 25 billion over 
the next decade unless congress amends housing laws 
the court rejected huds formula for granting rent increases to 
section 8 projects saying the agency cannot use rentcomparability 
studies to determine how much owners of subsidized apartments can 
raise rents 
logue said the ruling would cost hud 150 million in the circuit 
courts ninestate jurisdiction and if applied nationwide could cost 
from 600 million to 1 billion in retroactive rent adjustments and 
another 15 billion over the next 10 years 
sen bob graham dfla said the panel would consider the 
request and asked logue to provide more information on the ruling 
the moderate rehabilitation program was the subject of a scathing 
report earlier this year in which huds inspector general said that 
lucrative subsidies were awarded to former hud officials or other 
developers who retained prominent republican consultants 
much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision to 
repeal a fair share formula through which the subsidies were 
awarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need for 
the lowincome housing and the ability to administer the program 
hud officials took over most of the funding decisions after 
congress repealed the formula 
kemp however voluntarily decided to revert to using the fair 
share approach and his deputies said the department would continue 
that if the program is funded next year 
the inspector general also found that many moderate 
rehabilitation projects were approved at excessive rents costing 
the government hundreds of millions of dollars over the 15year 
subsidy contracts 
logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the 
beginning of the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 and hud would 
move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriately 
calculated

prime minister yitzhak shamir and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin met today to discuss rabins trip to egypt 
and the governments two main parties appeared locked in a dispute 
over egypts plan to sponsor israelipalestinian peace talks 
rabin left shamirs office without speaking to reporters after an 
hourlong meeting he spent seven hours in cairo on monday 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner refused to divulge details of the 
meeting but repeated shamirs remark monday that he could not 
maintain his governing coalition between his rightist likud bloc and 
the centerleft labor party at any price 
israeli newspapers reported that labor leaders were negotiating 
secretly with smaller religious parties to try to form a governing 
coalition if the current coalition falls 
the controversy centers on likuds opposition to mubaraks 
proposal for breaking a stalemate in the middle east peace process 
shamir is also concerned about rabins remarks at a cairo news 
conference hinting at israeli recognition of an indirect plo role in 
peace talks israeli radio stations reported 
israel officially refuses to deal with the palestine liberation 
organization which it views as a terror group 
in those remarks rabin said israel agreed to egypt arranging an 
israelipalestinian meeting he said egypt could put together the 
palestinian delegation after coordinating with various elements 
including israel 
palestinian leaders interpreted rabins remarks as consenting to 
egypts suggestion that the delegation include arabs deported by 
israel from the occupied territories 
that would be a compromise between israel and the plo because 
israel wants to include only palestinians from the west bank and 
gaza and the plo wants palestinians from outside 
shamir did not respond directly today to rabins remarks except 
to hint that his fractious governing coalition put together last 
december was in trouble 
i personally would like to see the coalition remain but i must 
say that unity is not worth any price he said 
shamir also is under heavy pressure from likud hardliners who 
oppose egypts plan because it urges israel to accept the principle 
of trading territory for peace 
foreign minister moshe arens tried to play down the crisis today 
we have coalition crises here an average of about once a month so 
we need another crisis today arens said 
two peace plans were discussed at the cairo meeting rabin and 
mubarak said in separate news conferences monday 
according to israels plan approved by the government in may 
17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip would elect 
delegates to negotiate with israel on an interim autonomy solution 
with the final status of the territories to be decided later 
mubaraks plan is more specific it calls for israel to trade 
land for peace and requires that the building of jewish settlements 
be halted in the occupied lands which israel seized in the 1967 
middle east war 
labor supports mubaraks 10point memorandum as way of breaking 
the impasse in the peace process and it is inclined to agree to 
talk with the deportees or with compromise candidates such as one 
defined by rabin as a palestinian professor from the united 
states 
mubarak said he will conduct the next round of peace talks in new 
york where he is to meet with labor leader shimon peres and also 
with arens 
the israeli cabinet will discuss the egyptian initiative in two 
to three weeks when both ministers return to the country rabin 
said

the fbi tipped off by tv viewers 
sent a blank sheet of paper by certified mail to catch a man 
suspected of staging his death in a 1982 boat explosion to collect 
more than 500000 in life insurance 
allen buck jones 34 featured last month on the program 
americas most wanted was arrested monday 
postal workers in dania had reported to the fbi that jones 
resembled a man named mark spencer who leased a postal box there on 
monday postal workers notified spencer that he had received an 
envelope via certified mail 
the envelope was an fbi ploy 
although postal workers attempted to stall him jones left before 
the fbi arrived but sheriffs deputies spotted his van and arrested 
him 
inside the van deputies found an automatic weapon a silencer 
40000 in cash a 40000 cashiers check and marijuana said 
sheriffs spokesman george crolius 
jones and his father are accused of trying to collect insurance 
from his death in south carolina which until may was thought to 
have been real 
the mystery began when jones boat exploded on lake murray near 
columbia sc one day before jones was to stand trial on burglary 
charges rescue workers found no body and jones was declared dead 
after the accident 
in may however an informant told investigators that jones was 
living in florida under the alias mark allen spencer the fbi said 
jones father charles m jones jr is in custody and is 
scheduled to stand trial later this month

the vatican said today that a roman catholic 
convent of carmelite nuns near the auschwitz death camp in poland 
should be moved to another site as jewish groups have sought 
breaking its silence on an issue that has severely strained 
jewishcatholic relations the vatican said it would help to pay for 
a prayer center in which the nuns would live 
jewish leaders in the united states applauded the statement and 
said it would improve jewishcatholic relations 
a february 1987 accord between jewish and roman catholic 
representatives stipulated that the nuns would be moved to the 
prayer center from a convent just outside auschwitz jews have 
objected to their presence at a site where 25 million jews were 
murdered by the nazis during world war ii 
however the polish primate cardinal josef glemp has called for 
renegotiating the agreement and said the polish church did not have 
the money to build a new home for the nuns 
the agreement signed in geneva called for the nuns to have been 
moved by feb 22 but the deadline passed and the nuns remained 
glemp on a 24hour visit to bristol england to consecrate a 
polish catholic church indicated he had not read the vatican 
statement 
based on what reporters had told him about the statement he 
said this would seem to be a forceful resolution of the problem 
and i dont think that would be a very positive way of resolving 
it 
but glemp also said there is a possibility that the nuns could 
move elsewhere 
but if they were to be moved this should be done with charity 
because even if we were to transfer these nuns to a different 
location that would also be crossing out their rights he said 
the archbishop of krakow cardinal franciszek macharski said 
last month that the church was abrogating the agreement since it 
could not be fulfilled in an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
the vaticans commission for religious relations with judaism 
said in a communique today that it was pleased with a declaration 
from polands bishops earlier this month that roman catholics and 
jewish groups should resume talks on building a prayer center in 
which the nuns would live 
the holy see is convinced that such a center would contribute 
in an important way to development of good relations between 
christians and jews the communique said 
the rev pier francesco fumagalli secretary of the commission 
told reporters he expected the geneva declaration would be honored 
but he added i cant forsee what will happen in poland 
he said the questions of exactly where when and how the prayer 
center would be built were being left to polish church officials 
asked whether the pope had approved the communique a vatican 
spokesman the rev giovanni dercole noted the statement had been 
published in the official vatican bulletin implying papal 
acceptance 
elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
said that because of the vatican communique his organization had 
decided to recommend to its constituencies around the world that 
they suspend their freeze on contacts with the vatican 
we welcome this very important step in restoring the good word 
of the church its time to move on and implement the agreement 
he said 
rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon weisenthal center in los 
angeles said the communique was a major policy reversal by the 
vatican that would remove a stumbling block in catholicjewish 
relations 
the issue was never over the rights of nonjews to pray at 
auschwitz hier said the issue was the building of permanent 
structures at auschwitz 
an estimated 25 million of the 4 million victims of 
auschwitzbirkenau were jewish and the convents opponents argue 
that it is deeply offensive that christian religious symbols tower 
over what is in effect their gravesite 
glemp has called the geneva accord offensive and he provoked 
further controversy with remarks deemed by many to be antisemitic 
an estimated 15 million christians also were killed at auschwitz 
the proposal to remove the convent founded in 1984 just outside 
the auschwitz fence has found little sympathy among poles they 
argue that the nuns are not harming anyone and that thousands of the 
victims at auschwitz were polish political prisoners including many 
priests and nuns 
the issue has also caused divisions among cardinals 
last weekend cardinal john j oconnor archbishop of new york 
said he supported jewish efforts to move the nuns and that he was 
exploring talking to pope john paul ii about the dispute 
jewish groups have asked the polishborn pope to step in and 
settle the controversy but until todays announcement the pope had 
left it up to the polish church to settle

a film company said tuesday 
that government censors have banned a video of the chippendales a 
troupe of male exotic dancers from the united states who are drawing 
capacity crowds at a resort in a black homeland 
videovision enterprises said in a statement that censors declared 
the video lustprovoking and offensive

the south african censors rulings have no authority in 
bophuthatswana and three other nominally independent homelands 
hazel feldman entertainment director at sun city said she was

comparable revue and have been playing to soldout houses

for thousands of neapolitans who gathered at 
the cathedral on tuesday the news could not have been better the 
dried blood of the citys patron saint st januarius liquified 
right on schedule 
the citys archbishop cardinal michele giordano announced the 
miracle to 5000 people after the faithful had prayed for only 
eight minutes 
the blood of the saint who was beheaded for his faith in ad 
305 almost always turns to liquid on sept 19 the day marking his 
death and two other days during the year 
last year the liquification took 34 minutes after prayers began 
superstition has it that bad luck or disaster will follow if the 
dried blood does not liquify the vatican has not classified the 
liquification as a miracle and generally disapproves of the way it 
is linked to misfortune 
italian scientists have theorized that the contents of the vial 
holding the dried blood liquifies from the warmth of the hands 
holding it

the jury at jim bakkers fraud trial today 
watched a videotape in which the tv evangelist pleaded for millions 
in donations while assuring followers i would not lie to you 
about anything 
prosecutors on monday began showing the eighthour tape culled 
from broadcasts of bakkers the ptl show 
on the tape bakker asked followers to send 1000 in exchange 
for lifetime partnerships guaranteeing three nights lodging a 
year for life at ptls heritage usa theme park 
a segment played today had bakker encouraging viewers to use 
their credit cards to buy a partnership 
im sincere i would not lie to you about anything bakker 
told viewers in 1984 he explained that he paid for his own 
partnership by credit card because he did not have the cash 
mr irs got to me first uncle sam just took everything we 
could scrape together he said 
on monday actor efrem zimbalist jr testified that the ptl board 
of directors on which he once served was little more than a rubber 
stamp for bakker 
bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million in ptl 
money raised from the partnerships so that he could live in style 
if convicted on all 24 counts bakker could be sentenced to 120 
years in prison and fined more than 5 million 
witnesses have testified they bought the partnerships but could 
not get rooms others testified that partnerships were oversold and 
that the money often was used to cover ptls daytoday operating 
costs rather than finance construction of the guaranteed rooms 
 
 
fbi agent harold pearson who compiled the videotape said more 
than 66000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time bakker 
left ptl despite a publicized limit of 25000 
all we need is 25000 people to become members bakker said 
on a program televised feb 20 1984 thats all the memberships 
we can have in the heritage grand hotel in two weeks we will be 
closed 
on the tape bakker consistently mentioned the restrictions 
when we reach the cutoff number we will have to refuse the 
gifts he told viewers to be honest we cant offer more 
memberships than we can physically handle 
on a march 7 1984 show bakker told viewers that about 1000 
partnerships had been sold each day since the promotion began 13 
days earlier but pearson said records showed fewer than 7300 had 
been sold at that point 
about a week earlier bakker said 12500 partnerships had been 
sold 
the memberships will be gone in a few days bakker said 
zimbalist testified that the ptl board of directors did not 
challenge bakker 
it was called a board of directors but at no time did it 
operate like one said zimbalist star of the fbi television 
series and board member from 1981 to 1986 it was a board of 
approval or affirmation only 
asked if he recalled approving a 390000 bonus for bakker 
zimbalist said oh no oh no 
the whitehaired actor who testified during a break in the 
production in spain of a television series zorro said the 
board was not informed of financial problems at its meetings

the communist party today handed president mikhail 
s gorbachev a chance next year to overhaul the party which he said 
was being left behind by the nations rapid social changes 
the partys 251member central committee its policymaking body 
opened a meeting primarily devoted to ethnic unrest throughout the 
soviet union but its first task was to reschedule the next congress 
of about 5000 party delegates for october 1990 the tass news 
agency said 
the decision to convene the congress at an earlier date is 
dictated by the need to thoroughly update the party itself with 
regard for its new role as the political vanguard of society during 
the state of restructuring gorbachev told the central committee 
he said the need to renew the party applied to the central 
committee itself 
a congress theoretically is the partys most powerful body 
setting broad policy lines as well as determining the membership of 
the central committee and the ruling politburo it historically has 
reviewed the leaderships economic plans for the ensuing five years 
congresses are usually held every five years and by party 
regulations the next congress would not have had to take place 
before early 1991 the last the 27th in the communist partys 
history was held in february 1986 
that was less than a year after gorbachev took power when the 
soviet leader had not yet accumulated as much power as he has now 
gorbachev expressed concern that the party is lagging behind the 
political reforms he has set in motion including the shift of more 
political power to elected government bodies 
the reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we 
often cannot catch up with them gorbachev said he said many 
party organizations were slow to grasp the need for change and in 
this we lose a great deal 
we cannot leave things as they are especially since 
fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an 
ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of 
social development gorbachev said 
some party stalwarts have said they fear the only legal political 
party in the country is losing its grip on power as the legislature 
strengthens under gorbachevs reform and frustrated citizens start 
taking local power into their own hands 
in addition to dissatisfaction with the poor state of the 
economy ethnic disputes across the country threaten to imperil 
gorbachevs reform drive 
on the eve of todays meeting armenian activists appealed to 
moscow to order an end to what they call an economic blockade 
imposed on their caucasus mountain republic by neighboring 
azerbaijan 
in azerbaijan two policemen were knifed to death and two others 
beaten by a mob of at least 200 people monday near a blockaded road 
in nagornokarabakh tass reported today the crowd attacking the 
policemen who were investigating an earlier dispute tass said 
the armeniaazerbaijan conflict over the nagornokarabakh 
territory is among the oldest and most intractable facing the soviet 
unions more than 100 ethnic groups 
armenias call for moscows assistance to get supplies of food 
building materials and fuel from azerbaijan shows how the ethnic 
problems interlock with the soviet unions economic difficulties 
theres no salt theres no sugar theres no oil said rem 
ananikyan an editor of the official armenian news agency armenpress 
worse yet he said that since the flow of supplies through 
azerbaijan dried up almost two months ago reconstruction of 
northwestern armenian cities devastated by decembers earthquake had 
stopped 
in a draft document published last month the party suggested 
that it is willing to look into opening the agreement made almost 70 
years ago by which the soviet union was formed on the ashes of 
czarist russia 
besides armenia and azerbaijan gorbachev and the communist party 
face ethnic disputes in at least seven other republics some have 
been marked by persistent violence with more than 200 people killed 
in the past 18 months 
communist party officials in the three baltic republics of 
estonia lithuania and latvia have joined in varying degrees with 
informal political movements that are demanding sovereignty from 
moscow that is a worrisome prospect for many in the kremlin at a 
time when some top officials are openly questioning whether the 
party is losing its grip on power

weve learned a lot more from this visit than the swedes have 
learned from us maine said 
chimney sweeping is an honored professions in sweden where 
woodstoves are widely used to combat the long winters 
a clogged chimney can be a fire hazard a huge fire that 
destroyed much of stockholm in the 1600s led to the establishment of 
the chimney sweep profession and the setting of inspection standards

ten years after soviet forces intervened in 
afghanistan the official press disclosed tuesday that the top 
soviet soldier in kabul opposed the move and lost his job because of 
it 
gen ivan g pavlovsky was overruled by thensoviet president 
leonid i brezhnev with the unanimous backing of the communist party 
politburo the weekly literary gazette 
the pagelong article printed in the papers latest edition on 
the decision to enter afghanistan in december 1979 was based on 
anatoly gromykos recollections of his conversations with his 
father former soviet foreign minister and president andrei a 
gromyko and an interview with pavlovsky 
the report was the first in the soviet press to disclose 
highlevel military opposition to the decision to enter afghanistan 
before the soviets completed their withdrawal on feb 15 13000 
soviet soldiers were killed the war between forces of the 
prosoviet afghan government and antimarxist rebels continues 
the newspaper report is part of a painful reevluation of the 
soviet experience in afghanistan spurred by the return of thousands 
of soldiers who suffered wounds in fighting or have not been able to 
readjust to life at home 
i reported to dmitiri f ustinov politburo member minister of 
defense and marshal of the soviet union that the entrance of our 
soldiers into afghanistan was not necesary pavlovsky told the 
paper 
he said he proposed instead that the politburo send a 
representative to kabul to express brezhnevs fears that afghan 
leader hafizullah amin would turn toward the united states 
soviet diplomats in afghanistan at the time did not understand 
the country and no one took into account its history of guerrilla 
resistance to foreign power pavlovsky said 
the actual date of the soviet intervention dec 27 1979 was 
scheduled one day ahead of a meeting in kabul between afghan leaders 
and the ambassador of pakistan pavlovsky said pakistan is a close 
ally of the united states and has served as a base and conduit of 
military supplies to the afghan rebels 
pavlovsky now 80 years old at the time was not only commander 
of soviet advisers in afghanistan but also a member of the 
communist party central committee a deputy defense minister and 
commander of soviet ground forces 
but when he returned from afghanistan he was removed from his 
defense ministry posts and sent to serve in a group of military 
inspectors literary gazette said 
the papers political observer igor belyaev said brezhnev in 
september 1979 turned down the appeal of afghan leader nur mohammad 
taraki for soviet soldiers to help fight the antimarxist 
resistance brezhnev told taraki that intervention in afghanistan by 
soviet soldiers would turn the majority of the population against 
the prosoviet government belyaev said 
taraki had been installed as president after a coup in april 1978 
but shortly after tarakis meeting with brezhnev the afghan 
leader was killed in an dispute within the party and amin took over 
brezhnev was shaken by the murder of taraki who not long ago 
had been his guest and thought that amins group could reach an 
agreement with the united states gromyko quoted his father the 
elder gromyko died in july 
amin was killed when soviet soldiers entered the country and he 
was replaced by babrak karmal 
the decision to enter afghanistan has been criticized widely in 
recent years as one made by a very small group of people 
gromyko citing his fathers recollections noted that the 
decision was indeed made behind the closed doors of brezhnevs 
office 
but he said that it then was approved by a meeting of the 
communist party central committee and that no one there or in the 
leadership of the soviet republics spoke out against the decision 
you can disagree with this decision today after 10 years but 
there is no basis to place under doubt the political foundations of 
our aid to afghanistan gromyko said

army scientists are gaining 
ground in their quest for the ultimate smoke screen a universal 
obscurant that would baffle an enemy fool smart weapons and 
conceal friendly forces 
smoke is known to have cloaked some battles of the peloponnesian 
war in the fifth century bc and the same tactic plays a major role 
in modern warfare said robert watson director of the armys smoke 
and obscurant project at this remote desert installation 
in the greater scheme of things its one of the most 
economical methods of providing a defensive and offensive posture 
watson said its a superb countermeasure to hightech weapons 
american and soviet interest in the subject intensified when 
smoke was used to mask israeli tanks from antitank guided missiles 
during the 1973 yom kippur war 
but the soviets who frequently used largescale smoke screens in 
world war ii jumped to an early lead and are believed to be 
developing a universal obscurant said maj edward newing chief 
of the smoke integration proponency office at fort mcclellan ala 
smokes are aerosols created by combustion of materials such as 
phosphorus or vapor condensations from fog oil or diesel oil while 
obscurants include metallic chaff such as the shreds of aluminum 
foil dropped from planes in world war ii to reflect false images on 
enemy radar or chemicals 
smoke dispersed by generators or packaged in canisters and fired 
from tanks mortars artillery or rockets can blind opposing forces 
or camouflage friendly troops from artillery or air attack 
delivered in the same way obscurants can scatter the radiant 
energy that soldiers and smart weapons use to track a target by 
radar thermalinfrared wavelengths or radio emissions 
a heatseeking missile for example focuses on infrared 
wavelengths but can be deflected or misguided by an obscurant that 
scatters the infrared energy watson said 
the army and navy and air force are becoming increasingly 
dependent on weapons systems that have electrooptical devices 
and we are sometimes critically dependent on these weapons to 
work newing said smoke and obscurants have the potential for 
degrading or defeating them 
in the past five years significant progress has been made in the 
armys research into a universal or multispectral obscurant 
designed to be effective across the electromagnetic spectrum 
such an obscurant might be made of airborne particulates capable 
of absorbing scattering or reflecting electromagnetic energy or 
even form a selfradiating source that would make it impossible for 
an enemy to distinguish between cloud and target 
details are classified but watson said field tests with soldiers 
are just a few years away 
were probably 80 percent down the road to achieving the 
goal he said its well within sight 
the value of a universal obscurant is its flexibility newing 
said 
if you know what type of sensors your adversary has and you 
know what sensors you have you can tailor your obscurant to affect 
him and not you he said 
in the meantime newing said soldiers receive regular training 
in the use of smoke and obscurants particularly in light of the 
soviet effort 
both of us are investing in modern technology and thats 
increasing the lethality out there he said and when you have 
something like obscurants that can alter lethality it raises some 
flags 
smoke and obscurants were used at dugway last summer when more 
than 12000 army national guard and reserve artillery soldiers 
gathered for a livefire training exercise 
were in a constant effort to make sure that smoke and 
obscurants are spread and integrated as a system across all the 
different types of branches artillery aviation and infantry 
newey said the army is not underestimating the threat were 
taking it seriously

near 105 mph with hurricaneforce winds extending up to 60 miles 
from the center it was moving to the northwest at 12 mph and was 
expected to continue in that direction during the next 24 hours 
a hurricane watch was in effect for the central bahamas and 
tropical storm warnings for the southern bahamas

cambodias rulers decorated departing 
vietnamese military chiefs tuesday and said vietnams 11year 
occupation was not only legal but also humanitarian because it 
stopped massacres by the khmer rouge 
in a ceremony authorities presented the angkor order a top 
cambodian military distinction to commanders of the eight army 
navy and air force units that are to begin leaving thursday in what 
vietnam says will be the pullout of its last 26000 troops 
chea sim the no 2 man in phnom penhs ruling communist party 
pinned medals on the officers before making a speech praising them 
for having toppled the fanatical communist khmer rouge regime in 
late 1978 
the presence of the vietnamese in cambodia during the last 10 
years is a legal act and humanitarian aid he said of the 
intervention which was condemned by many noncommunist nations as a 
violation of international law and the united nations charter 
the khmer rouge killed people the people were scared all the 
time he said the presence of the vietnamese troops in cambodia 
has saved cambodian lives 
chea sim quoted a cambodian proverb best friends help each 
other in time of need 
the khmer rouge killed a million people during its nearly 
fouryear experiment in creating a pure peasant society 
it now is the largest member of the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition fighting the vietnamese and the phnom penh government that 
was installed days after the invasion 
the fighting could escalate sharply after the vietnamese pullout 
because the phnom penh forces will stand alone against the khmer 
rouge 
chea sim also president of the national assembly said the 
guerrillas still oppose his government although it has amended the 
constitution overseen the vietnamese pullout and tried to find a 
political settlement 
he said that at the 19nation talks in paris the enemy tried 
to get the khmer rouge back to powerto get the murderers to kill 
more people 
the talks in august collapsed when phnom penh rejected guerrilla 
demands that the khmer rouge join a transitional government before 
an election is held 
the guerrillas have charged that vietnam is hiding and disguising 
troops instead of withdrawing them they said the soviet union 
recently escalated arms supplies to phnom penh a charge the soviet 
ambassador to phnom penh rashit khamidouline denied monday 
in ho chi minh city tuesday the vietnamese government refused to 
rule out fighting another war in cambodia 
maj gen nguyen van thai chief spokesman for the ministry of 
national defense also claimed that vietnams major achievement 
during the war was not strategic but involved saving the cambodian 
people from genocide 
he tacitly acknowledged that vietnam had failed in its goal to 
wipe out cambodian resistance when he predicted factional fighting 
would continue in cambodia after the vietnamese army withdraws 
the officer spoke at a news conference to announce the start of 
the last stage of vietnams withdrawal which began in july 1988 
in case of a threat of the genocidal regime coming back then i 
think the government of the state of cambodia would call on the 
international community for help he said if called on for 
assistance thai said the vietnamese army would then announce its 
decision 
at the bassack hall in phnom penh a clanging band blared martial 
music as officials hailed the 150 vietnamese soldiers at tuesdays 
twohour ceremony 
the soldiers received their decorations on a stage holding this 
nations autocrats the military commanders and members of the 
communist party politburo its highest body a red curtain behind 
them displayed sidebyside national emblems vietnams yellow star 
and cambodias angkor wat temple 
after shrill militant speeches laden with communist jargon 
hundreds of school children wearing red kerchiefs the partys 
young pioneers marched into the hall beating drums and other 
instruments 
a little girl climbed onstage and her face hidden by the 
microphones on the podium hailed the vietnamese troops and 
condemned the khmer rouge supported by china and the united 
states 
long live the heroic vietnamese soldiers she shouted three 
times a fist thrust high in the air

vice president dan quayle met tuesday 
with prime minister kang younghoon while hundreds of student 
radicals held rallies denouncing the south korean government and the 
united states 
quayle praised south koreas recent democratic reforms but asked 
kang why political violence continued a south korean official said 
kang replied that it was because the korean people still have 
little experience with democracy and tend to shun compromise and 
stick to a logic of choosing between black and white the source 
said 
the official who demanded anonymity said quayle and kang 
discussed a wide range of issues including the future of the 43000 
us troops in south korea david beckwith quayles spokesman said 
they discussed subjects ranging from president roh taewoos visit 
to washington oct 26 to eastwest relations 
the meeting was productive and i am looking forward to meeting 
and learning about the korean people quayle told reporters 
neither he nor kang would describe what they discussed 
during the 45minute meeting hundreds of radical students held 
antigovernment antius rallies on at least five college 
campuses the students represent a small minority that has failed to 
win widespread support 
hundreds of riot police ringed the schools but there were no 
reports of arrests or injuries 
at kyunghee university in eastern seoul 50 students burned a 
us flag and an effigy of quayle they also shouted slogans calling 
the new us ambassador donald gregg a cia master of political 
manipulation 
protests were also reported at three other campuses in seoul 
including seoul municipal polytech university where 100 students 
burned a us flag and chanted we oppose quayles visit to the 
death 
in the southern provincial city of kwangju 500 radical students 
shouted yankee go home and battled police with firebombs and 
rocks police said 
the protests were small by south korean standards and dissident 
groups made no effort to organize street demonstrations against 
quayles visit 
the radicals are demanding an end to close ties with washington 
and expulsion of the us troops based in south korea 
quayle is on the first stop of an asian trip that also will take 
him to japan the philippines and malaysia he meets on wednesday 
with roh and heads of the main opposition political parties which 
often clash with roh 
south korean opposition leaders planned to tell quayle about 
their concerns over deteriorating human rights opposition party

rep barney frank is wrestling with the 
question of whether he can remain an effective liberal in congress 
following the disclosure of his relationship with a male prostitute 
his friends and allies say 
an aide to frank said monday the massachusetts democrat will not 
resign his congressional seat despite calls for his resignation by 
newspapers in his district 
frank declined to be interviewed monday but in a weekend 
interview with the boston globe said he will not seek reelection 
next year if he decides the controversy hurts the liberal causes he 
has espoused during 10 years in congress 
the question for him to decide that will make the difference 
is whether he believes he could be an effective member of 
congress that he would not do this just to go through the 
motions said ann lewis franks sister and a washington political 
consultant 
frank disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 and won reelection the 
next year with 70 percent of the vote in a district that has elected 
him five times to congress 
democratic strategists said they believe franks support within 
his own district remains strong despite the revelations about his 
involvement with prostitute stephen l gobie but they said frank 
may feel pressure to resign because of the scandals effects on his 
issues or other democrats 
the boston globe which enthusiastically endorsed frank 
throughout his political career said in an editorial sunday that he 
should resign for his own good and for the good of his 
constituents his causes and congress 
the anchor a small but influential roman catholic newspaper in 
his district called on frank to resign last week 
doug cahn franks administrative assistant said barney will 
not resign he wants to see the process with the ethics committee 
move forward 
the house ethics committee is investigating franks dealings with 
gobie at franks request 
one group of supporters the liberal armscontrol group council 
for a livable world circulated a letter monday urging frank to 
ignore calls for his resignation it said even a barney frank 
whose effectiveness in congress is somewhat diminished this year 
still ranks among the most effective members in the us congress 
frank has acknowledged that he paid gobie for sexual relations 
after responding to an ad in a gay newspaper in 1985 and then hired 
him as a personal assistant frank said hoped to help gobie give up 
his past but gobie said he used franks apartment for prostitution 
and that frank was aware of his activities frank says he did not 
know 
in a taped interview on the geraldo talk show telecast today 
gobie elaborated on his claims saying he ran a female escort 
service called a touch of class from the congressmans 
apartment a friend who ran a male escort service also occasionally 
callforwarded telephone service to gobie he said 
i more or less served as a reservation clerk for the girls 
he said 
in an interview with newsweek frank said gobie wasnt the 
first prostitute i had used 
frank said that because of his difficulties he will lessen his 
role on one issue the investigation of alleged influencepeddling 
at the department of housing and urban development during the reagan 
administration he is a member of the house subcommittee leading the 
hud investigation 
frank has been outspoken in a number of liberal causes but 
particularly in areas of ethics legislation housing and homosexual 
rights 
maria foscarinis executive director of the national law center 
on homelessness and poverty described frank as one of the leading 
advocates for housing programs in congress and said his problems are 
a concern to other housing advocates 
i think theres some concern about the effect that this will 
have on his advocacy she said the question is whether the 
issue will become so consuming that it will obscure his ability to 
take positions on substantive issues 
judith lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund 
said other members of congress have overcome embarrassing personal 
disclosures or poor judgment adding that in the long term his 
effectiveness as an important public servant should in no way be 
harmed by his personal misjudgments 
dorothy reichard director of franks district office in newton 
mass said calls and letters have been running 8to1 in support

john zaccaro the son of former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro cited sloppy police 
tactics when he asked the vermont supreme court to overturn his 
conviction on a cocaine charge 
the issue is how freely the government can enter a house in 
disguise kathleen sullivan zaccaros lawyer said monday during 
oral arguments 
zaccaro 26 was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram of 
cocaine to an undercover police woman at his offcampus apartment in 
middlebury in 1986 he served his sentence but has appealed the 
conviction in an effort to clear his record 
the court is not expected to rule before december 
sullivan a harvard law professor said state police should have 
found a witness or come up with solid evidence before sending an 
undercover officer to zaccaros home while he was a student at 
middlebury college 
prosecutor susan harritt contended before the court that police 
did not violate zaccaros rights because the undercover officer was 
invited into his home clearly stated her intention to buy cocaine 
and made the purchase without disguising her identity 
the state sees this in a fundamentally different way she 
said this case in fact does not involve a search if the court 
believes that a search did take place no warrant was needed because 
the officer was invited into the home 
zaccaro who recently opened a new york pasta shop appeared at 
ease during the hearing talking and laughing with lawyers he would 
not comment before or after the hearing other than to compliment 
his lawyers and express confidence the court would be fair 
zaccaro was sentenced to a term of one to five years with all 
but four months suspended he served the four months in a socalled 
house arrest program that allowed him to live in a 
1500amonth apartment with maid service and cable television 
the trial followed legal wrangling over whether zaccaro was 
selectively prosecuted due to his mothers fame sullivans state 
supreme court brief again raised the claim but she did not cover 
the issue during oral arguments

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze meet in wyoming at a 
time of tumultuous change in superpower relations ranging from 
reforms in the soviet union to talk of reunification of a germany 
divided when the cold war began four decades ago 
the changes have produced pressures on president bush and on 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who likely is sending his 
foreign minister with new ideas for cuts in strategic arms the 
experts say 
bush meanwhile is being pushed to respond more warmly to 
changes under way in the soviet bloc 
shevardnadze will talk with bush thursday at the white house 
then will head for jackson hole wyo to meet through the weekend 
with baker 
an exploding volcano might be a more fitting backdrop than the 
immovable grand teton mountains for the bakershevardnadze 
discussion of changes under way in the communist world 
since they last met in july a major postwar milestone has been 
passed the installation of a solidarity government in poland the 
first noncommunist regime in the soviet bloc 
hungary another warsaw pact nation is also moving toward a 
multiparty system and the speaker of the hungarian parliament was 
quoted in the washington post on tuesday predicting his nation would 
ultimately leave the sovietled military alliance precisely that 
step precipitated the soviet invasion of hungary in 1956 
also hungarys allowing of thousands of east german refugees to 
cross into austria has riveted world attention on eastern europe 
and gorbachev has had to concern himself at home with surging 
sentiment for more selfdetermination or even independence in a 
growing number of soviet republics 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said in a speech 
tuesday the tremendous change in the nature of our discourse with 
the soviet leadership is primarily the result of unprecedented and 
exciting developments which are taking place in the soviet union 
but the crushing of prodemocracy forces in china and warnings by 
gorbachev of a possible conservative coup in the soviet union are 
stark reminders that all change is not permanent and that 
superpower relations could be plunged back into the bad old days of 
the cold war 
things may well get out of control but they are unlikely to 
lead to a peaceful evolution toward liberal democracy in the 
soviet union retired lt gen william odom said in a speech sept 9 
civil war and disorder followed by reassertion of 
authoritarianism seem more probable said odom who spent his 
military career watching the soviet union including a stint as head 
of the supersecretive national security agency 
gorbachev in reforming soviet foreign policy has withdrawn 
threatening tank forces from eastern europe announced a cut of 
500000 in the red army and declared a defensive doctrine 
mr gorbachev has made many people in europe and the united 
states believe that the soviet military threat has gone away it has 
not of course but there are some signs that it will decline 
said odom advocating a cautious response similar to that espoused 
by defense secretary dick cheney 
the administrations restraint has come under from fire from 
liberals who want the white house to encourage change in the soviet 
union and supply greater levels of aid to nations like poland that 
are on the troubled road of reform 
president bush must reach beyond the status quo thinking that 
appears to dominate administration speaking senate majority 
leader george mitchell of maine said monday 
he must cast aside ambivalence and hesitation and timidity and 
adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the soviet union 
and eastern europe mitchell said 
bush administration officials have moved within the past week to 
keep pace with changes in the soviet bloc saying they will double 
food deliveries to poland to 100 million and grant 
mostfavorednation status to hungary to reduce tariffs on hungarian 
exports to the united states 
the president reacted carefully monday when asked about possible 
reunification of germany thats for the germans to decide he 
answered though he added that such a move should not be viewed as 
bad for western interests 
the administration has also tried to expand the ussoviet 
dialogue to new areas such as fighting terrorism and drug 
trafficking and cleaning up the environment 
the plan bush says is to integrate the soviet union more deeply 
into the community of lawabiding nations 
today we are witnessing what are potentially the first steps 
in the transformation of a totalitarian society into one governed by 
the rule of law eagleburger told a meeting of the national 
conference on soviet jewry 
and as these changes unfold the relationship between the 
united states and the soviet union could move from an adversarial to 
a cooperative one he said 
in addition the expanding dialogue shevardnadze will push hard 
for arms control progress when he meets bush at the white house 
thursday and may be carrying a new kremlin proposal experts say 
it would be customary for shevardnadze to hand bush a letter 
from the soviet leader and gorbachev being gorbachev it would 
not be too surprising for it contain some dramatic proposals said 
one administration official speaking on condition he not be further 
identified 
although sticking points remain in the proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty start shevardnadze and baker are expected to 
announce several important steps on other topics including 
an agreed statement expanding superpower human rights 
dialogue from such traditional areas as emigration to new topics 
involving cooperation on occupational safety the environment and 
the criminal code 
a agreement on determining the chemical weapon stockpiles of 
each side preliminary to a multilateral agreement sharply curbing 
the production or possession of such arms 
a protocol on verifying treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 but 
never ratified by the us senate barring each side from testing 
nuclear devices of greater than 150 kilotons

after she recovers from a heart attack 
mother teresa will have to give up the hectic schedule that earned 
her a nobel peace prize and adapt to a slower pace her doctors said 
tuesday 
her heart is old and shes not young dr george lombardi an 
infectious disease specialist from the united states told a news 
conference at least for the time being she will have to change 
her lifestyle 
a medical bulletin issued late tuesday said mother teresas 
condition is improving and she has had no chest pains since monday 
her temperature also has been normal one of her physicians said 
despite recent health problems the 79yearold roman catholic 
nun has traveled the world incessantly to offer care and comfort to 
the poor 
mother teresa who won the 1979 nobel peace prize for her work 
suffered a heart attack on sept 8 three days after she was 
admitted to woodlands nursing home with a high fever and acute 
vomiting 
doctors attached a temporary pacemaker but it was removed after 
she developed chest pains she has been taking steroids since then 
they said 
her temprature has been controlled but the problem remains 
with her intermittent chest pains we are rather concerned about 
that otherwise she is comfortable said dr rajen watts 
the angina pain is serious but not critical he said 
watts said mother teresas temperature is now 976 and that she 
is conscious eating well and resting comfortably 
watts also said a viral infection that triggered the fever now is 
under control he said doctors still do not know the cause and are 
awaiting results from blood samples sent to the tropical disease 
institute 
the virus however has affected her heart he said 
doctors also said the frail nun had developed a secondary 
infection which also has not been diagnosed 
we are hopeful that this will go in a couple of days 
lombardi said 
although they gave no time frame doctors said mother teresas 
recovery probably will take longer than the normal four to six weeks 
the yugoslavborn nun developed chest pains and a high fever 
thursday a week after the heart attack doctors said the setback 
may have been caused partly by a steady stream of visitors to the 
hospitals intensive care unit on monday doctors said no one would 
be allowed to see her 
mother teresa founded the missionaries of charity in october 1950 
in an abandoned hostel donated by the city the order formally 
recognized by the vatican in 1965 expanded and now has 3000 nuns 
working in 87 countries

conviction arguing that police set up the undercover buy on the 
basis of campus rumors not hard evidence 
the issue is how freely the government can enter a house in 
disguise kathleen sullivan argued monday this undercover was 
arranged solely on the basis of rumor nothing like hard evidence 
nothing like reasonable suspicion 
the 26yearold son of former vice presidential candidate 
geraldine ferraro was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram 
of cocaine to an undercover police woman at his offcampus apartment 
in 1986 while a student at middlebury college 
zaccaro served four months house arrest in a 1500amonth 
apartment with maid service and cable television but is seeking to 
clear his record 
sullivan said state police should have found a witness or located 
solid evidence before sending an undercover officer into zaccaros 
home 
but assistant attorney general susan harritt countered that 
police did not violate zaccaros rights because the undercover 
officer was invited into his home clearly stated her intention to 
buy cocaine and made the purchase without disguising her identity 
the officer said i understand i can buy some drugs from 
you and he said sure come on in harritt told the court 
she was not asked to explain anything about herself he didnt ask 
her whether or not she was police 
associate justice john dooley told harritt he was troubled about 
some aspects of the probe noting that rumors abound on college 
campuses 
zaccaro who has recently opened a new york pasta shop declined 
to comment other than to compliment his lawyers and express 
confidence the court would render a fair decision 
his lawyers have argued also that zaccaro was selectively 
prosecuted because of his mothers fame

out at 1000 pounds 1570 a hair he was very pleased and very 
happy said sothebys appraiser bunny campione 
the twotone bear made by german manufacturer steiff in 1920 
has unusually large eyes that make it look a little forlorn and 
is in such good condition it doesnt look as if it has been 
cuddled very much she said 
mrs campione said the bear had been expected to sell for up to 
7800 but had earlier been listed in an auction house catalogue at 
1100 to 1400 
there is no justifiable reason why it made so much money she 
said in a telephone interview 
the previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was 19000 
paid at a christies auction in london on may 18 for a steiff bear 
made between 1906 and 1909 for princess xenia a cousin of czar 
nicholas ii

blond and brown amberandblack glass eyes measuring about 1 inch

it from his grandmother mrs campione said 
the grandmother considered him the bear to be very much her 
own and kept him away from the children who were allowed to see him 
but not to play with him she said 
mrs campione a finedoll expert said she was baffled by the 
sale price for a bear that was hardly rare 
a few thousand were made in 1920 instead of a few million 
but it is in unusually superb condition she said most of 
them are cuddled or kissed on the nose so much that the nose gets 
dented in or get dragged around the garden by children 
she speculated that the buyer may want the bear as a prototype 
for limited edition 
at the first teddy bear auction organized by mrs campione at 
sothebys in 1982 the most expensive teddy went for 630 
richard steiffs lovable creations took the world by storm at the 
leipzig toy fair in 1903 and valuable teddies are now almost 
exclusively made by steiff at the village of giengen in southern 
germany

vermonts supreme court ruled today that 
one of its retired justices was guilty of judicial misconduct for 
helping a female friend who was a lowercourt judge 
the ruling said retired justice william hill committed seven 
ethics violations primarily for sitting on cases involving former 
assistant judge jane wheel and for intimidating the state attorney 
general by personally delivering a letter urging that a criminal 
probe of wheel be speeded up 
hill 72 was one of three supreme court justices charged with 
misconduct in 1987 by the judicial conduct board an arm of the 
court the board alleged the three improperly used their clout to 
help wheel then an assistant judge in chittenden county in a 
variety of matters 
the charges threw the fivemember court into turmoil gov 
madeleine kunin asked the three to step aside while the accusations 
were examined they refused but disqualified themselves from all 
cases involving anyone involved in the complaints which affected 
hundreds of cases 
the charges against justice ernest gibson iii were dropped for 
lack of a case justice thomas hayes died before the allegations 
against him were resolved 
a court employee testified that wheel had been seen with her arms 
around hill but hill and wheel testified they were not close and 
did not have an affair hill described their relationship as 
collegial 
the judicial conduct board found hill guilty of 11 counts of 
misconduct but it was up to the states high court to decide hills 
fate today the high court dismissed four counts but upheld the 
others 
a judge can never avoid the prestige and authority of the 
office he or she holds said the court that prestige and 
authority however may not be used to enhance personal 
relationships or for selfish reasons or to bestow favors 
the court said it would hear arguments next week on what 
sanctions to impose against hill because hill is retired the 
sanctions range from a reprimand to suspension from service as a 
substitute justice on high court cases 
hills pension will not be affected 
hills lawyer michael marks said he and hill felt the decision 
was a mixed bag 
the case was heard by a specially assigned court since most of 
the members who sat on the court with hill disqualified themselves 
wheel was convicted in a separate criminal case involving 
allegations she billed the state for days she did not work

president bush declaring that sound 
ecology and a strong economy can coexist prodded congress today 
to pass his legislation to clean up the nations fouled air 
in a speech at a riverfront celebration of washingtons 100th 
anniversary of statehood bush called upon all americans to join 
in a renewed spirit of conservation including recycling their 
trash and generating less waste 
with house speaker thomas foley the hometown democratic 
congressman at his side the president said when it comes to 
clear air we need action on the legislation weve proposed now 
bush who sent the clean air bill to capitol hill on july 21 
said every day that passes is another day were postponing 
progress on clean air now it is up to the congress to pass this 
clean air legislation this year 
bush has been sparring with the democraticcontrolled congress 
over drugs and other issues but foley told reporters monday he 
expects congress to send bush a clean air bill to his liking either 
late this year or early in 1990 
it will be an achievement for both the congress and the 
administration foley said the plan now is in house and senate 
subcommittees 
bush proposed a 10billionton reduction in acid rainproducing 
sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 a 2millionton reduction 
in nitrous oxide and a 40 percent cut in other emissions that cause 
urban smog it also calls for use of alternative fuels in 1 million 
vehicles by 1997 
environmentalists and their allies in congress have criticized 
the goals as too modest and say the plan would leave too much to the 
discretion of the environmental protection agency and in some cases 
to the affected industries 
bush winding up a twoday swing that also took him to centennial 
celebrations in south dakota and montana said the majestic 
spokane river coursing through downtown spokane over waterfalls 
and volcanic outcroppings has been reborn from its 
oncepolluted state a symbol of the nations environmental progress 
i took this trip out west because im concerned about the 
future of the planet we share the president said 
today im asking all americans to join in a renewed spirit of 
conservation a new commitment to a more careful stewardship of the 
natural world 
bush called for applying the creativity of the marketplace in 
the service of the environment sound ecology and a strong economy 
can coexist 
he lauded a wastedisposal fee system in seattle that he said has 
cut waste by nearly onefourth those results he said need to be 
duplicated everywhere in america 
local communities businesses large and small individual 
families all can learn to generate less waste and recycle more of 
the waste that is generated bush said 
at the event witnessed by thousands in riverfront park foley 
called bushs appearance a proud movement for the state of 
washington and a high honor for himself 
the president returned the compliment calling foley a man of 
integrity decency fair play and ok hes a democrat but hes 
a man i am very proud and honored to work with 
after the speech bush and foley picked up shovels to plant a 
centennial elm sappling transplanted from a white house tree then 
left the park to return to washington aboard air force one 
bush in a news conference monday in the montana state senate 
chambers in helena urged congress to get on with his 79 
billion antidrug strategy the american people want action 
theres a certain frustration level when we come out with a 
sound program and two answers come out spend more and raise 
taxes he said 
elsewhere in the news conference bush 
announced plans to grant hungary most favored nation trading 
status in recognition of its political and economic reforms 
said he feels in no rush to hold a summit with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev bush defended the pace of strategic 
arms negotiations and said the united states is not going to just 
react to proposals by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
bush will see shevardnadze at the white house on thursday before the 
soviets weekend retreat with secretary of state james a baker iii 
in wyoming 
said there is no hard intelligence evidence colombian drug 
lords are targeting his family but warned any attack would just 
bring down the total wrath of the american people and the american 
government 
called it too soon after the tiananmen massacre to resume 
total normalcy of uschina relations bush said there are 
still great difficulties there but he defended ties by us 
businessmen including his brother with beijing 
declared if the two germanys decided to reunite i do not 
think we should view that as bad for western interests 
decried recent racial violence in new york and elsewhere 
saying it says something ugly whenever theres an incident of 
that nature but he refused to call it a trend 
predicted not a single governor at next weeks education summit 
wants the federal government to mandate changes in the nations 
schools 
but in an earlier address to state legislators bush said it may 
be time to consider radical changes because us schools are not 
making the grade 
expressed hope that the winter will be kind to the 
environmental damage in alaska from the exxon valdez oil spill he 
said his decision not to visit alaska on this western trip was no 
indication of a lack of interest in the problem we had an 
environmental vice president quayle that went he said 
indicated he does not know what the final answer will be if 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat seeks a us 
visa to speak at the united nations

the fledgling market for private longterm care 
insurance is growing rapidly but inherent limitations will halt 
the trend long before protection reaches most americans says a 
leading expert on social insurance 
in a new book former social security commissioner robert m ball 
says private insurance cannot possibly do the job alone and 
argues for a new government program akin to social security to 
finance basic longterm care protection for all americans 
only a plan that anticipates the needs of society as a whole 
and spreads the risk as broadly as possible can meet the need at a 
cost that is bearable for each of us ball writes in the book 
because were all in this together 
ball said that while longterm care coverage gradually is 
improving from the earliest expensive and restrictive policies 
private insurers will be unable to offer adequate protection that 
most americans can afford 
they know exactly what consumers want but the dilemma is that 
when those wants are met the cost goes up very considerably 
shrinking the market for the newly improved policies ball wrote 
one major problem is that the policies mainly attract the elderly 
and others likely to need coverage leading companies to respond to 
the increased risk with high premiums and strict limits on 
eligibility he said 
younger wouldbe buyers are put off by the failure of the 
policies to protect beneficiaries against inflation ball said 
private insurers so far have sold about 1 million longterm care 
policies most of them in the past two years providing limited 
coverage to less than 2 percent of the age 50andup population 
ball said 
while the market is likely to expand dramatically and policies 
gradually are getting better inherent limitations will put a stop 
to the growth of the longterm care market long before private 
insurance can offer real protection for most people he wrote 
the october issue of consumer reports magazine includes a survey 
of 24 longterm care plans and concludes that many companies have 
improved their policies by eliminating some coverage restrictions 
the magazine said other companies however are denying 
policyholders benefits by digging up problems in their medical 
histories only after a claim is filed 
ball predicted pressure for a better and broader solution will 
grow along with public concern about the rising cost of longterm 
care the bill for one year in a nursing home averaged 25000 in 
1988 and the limits of current government coverage 
its not just a matter of the elderly wanting more protection 
for themselves he said those who are really at risk most are 
middleaged people either needing to bring their parents into their 
homes to care for them or facing very high expenses for nursing home 
care 
ball served as social security commissioner from 19621973 
played a key role in the 1983 reform of social security and was the 
chief administrator of medicare for its first seven years he now 
chairs the national academy of social insurance a nonprofit group 
that promotes research and education about social security and 
related programs

the sevendayaweek bank unaware of the message on the back of the 
slip that read give me 10000 i have a gun 
the next thing he noticed was five to 10 policemen rushing in the 
door 
they told us to get on the floor said mulcahey i thought 
for a minute it was a hostage situation somewhere else in the bank 
he was handcuffed put in a patrol car and told he was being 
arrested for attempted bank robbery said mulcahey 
police released mulcahey from jail monday and he returned to 
classes at the university of illinois law school bank officials

it appears mr mulcahey was the victim of an unfortunate 
hoax said gerald oneill chief executive officer of the marine 
bank of champaignurbana 
the only one i am unhappy with is the person who wrote that 
note mulcahey said it was a sick joke a sad way to get a 
laugh 
of his night alone in a jail cell he said its pretty 
worrisome scary

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today continued soviet weapons shipments to nicaragua will be a 
priority issue when he meets later this week with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze in wyoming 
were a little disappointed in whats going on down there 
baker said referring to the role of the soviets and other east bloc 
countries in building up the sandinista military arsenal 
baker told a news conference that most of the soviet weaponry 
arrives in nicaragua via third countries he added that the soviets 
could put a stop to the practice if they so chose 
president bush said monday in helena mont that the increased 
flow of soviet bloc arms to nicaragua indicates not a very kind 
and gentle approach to this hemisphere 
bush spoke after the state department said soviet bloc weapons 
deliveries to nicaragua have continued at a rate of more than one a 
week this year despite a ceasefire dating back 18 months 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev pledged early this year to cut 
off weapons deliveries to the sandinistas but administration 
officials insisting on anonymity said soviet weapons were spotted 
last week being loaded onto a nicaraguan vessel at a port in cuba 
the equipment has since been delivered to nicaragua 
the officials declined comment on a published report that the 
weapons consisted of three torpedocarrying boats and four mi24 
hind helicopters 
the leak of that sensitive information seemed calculated to 
influence the upcoming meeting friday and saturday between baker and 
shevardnadze one purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork 
for a summit meeting between gorbachev and president bush 
the state department said monday that soviet bloc deliveries to 
nicaragua for the first eight months of this year totaled about 350 
million the equipment weighed an estimated 12000 tons and was 
delivered during 41 ship visits to nicaraguan ports the state 
department said adding that the value of such shipments during all 
of 1988 was 515 million 
earlier monday spokeswoman margaret tutwiler expressed 
irritation that overall deliveries to nicaragua appear to have 
increased this year compared with a similar period in 1988 
officials had expected a decline since the sandinista government 
and the nicaraguan resistance reached agreement on a truce in march 
1988 although there have been some violations of the truce the 
level of fighting is down sharply from 1987 
ms tutwiler said the level of soviet bloc shipments is well 
beyond the legitimate defense needs of nicaragua 
it is inexplainable to us why the east bloc feels that it must 
provide nicaragua with even more weapons while a ceasefire is in 
effect than it provided the nicaraguans when they were actively 
engaged with contra forces she said 
the basic pattern in recent years has been transshipment of 
soviet weapons through cuba ms tutwiler said this year the 
weapons out of cuba has increased dramatically 
ms tutwiler also said cuba and nicaragua continue to supply arms 
to the leftist fmln guerrillas in el salvador 
the fmln has come to rely chiefly on soviet bloc weapons she 
said adding that such activity defies agreements signed by central 
american presidents which call for an end to outside support for 
insurgencies in the region

the warm waters of the tropics generate almost 
daily clouds and showers a few of which for reasons not well 
understood grow into some of natures largest and most dangerous 
storms 
these are storms like hurricane hugo which forecasters say may 
hit the united states later this week after battering many caribbean 
islands like the cyclones that have killed thousands in bangladesh 
and like the typhoons that recently took hundreds of lives in china 
to meteorologists these are all tropical cyclones giant 
whirling areas of low pressure winds churning counterclockwise 
around the center and drawing strength from the warm water beneath 
why do some low pressure areas peter out and others turn into 
mighty storms 
nobody knows for sure admits meteorologist rainer bleck of 
the university of miami 
but while bleck says much more study is needed he was able in a 
telephone interview to describe how these storms strengthen live 
and die 
like tornadoes and the midlatitude storms than often generate 
blizzards in winter hurricanes are basically regions of low 
pressure the result of rising air 
but tornadoes powerful and dangerous as they are are tiny 
compared to hurricanes a tornado is local forming from an 
individual cloud in 20 minutes to half an hour bleck observed 
hurricanes cover thousands of square miles and take five to six days 
to form 
the sun warms the earth concentrating its strength near the 
equator the resultant heated air expands and rises creating a ring 
of low pressure and rain around the globe known as the intertropical 
convergence zone 
hurricanes form to the north and south of this zone but due to 
the same sort of heating bleck explained 
the sun warms the water some of which evaporates to wet this 
warm rising air he pointed out this creates a region of hot wet 
air 1000 to 2000 feet above the ocean 
the warm moist air rises as it cools with the water eventually 
condensing into clouds that form tropical showers and storms 
but at this point a new factor is added condensing water 
releases more heat into the air just as humidity condensing on a 
cold glass in summer warms it up 
so the rising air is warmed again and thats the kicker for 
the storm said bleck it spurs on the formation of clouds by 
increasing the lift of the air drawing in more moisture from below 
to provide additional fuel 
at the same time bleck explained the clouds begin to turn 
taking some of the earths spin as their own creating the 
counterclockwise turning of the storm 
this is known as the coriolis effect turning the storms 
counterclockwise north of the equator the opposite way to the 
south it doesnt happen at the equator but gains strength away 
from that line 
as the winds get closer to the center of the storm they move 
faster just as an ice skater spins faster when she pulls her arms 
closer to her body 
for reasons not well understood a clear eye forms in the middle 
of the storm as it gains strength bleck commented 
air in this central region is descending and as a result remains 
clear in contrast to the wall of clouds in the spinning rising air 
around it 
as long as the warm wet air from tropical oceans is available 
it fuels the storm engine bleck explained providing rising 
moisture that condenses releasing more heat to drive the fury 
onward 
the storms move little on their own however he added 
rather general winds and upper air currents pull them along 
first to the west into the caribbean or gulf of mexico and then 
turning north to collide with the united states or follow along the 
east coast the track depends on many things including the location 
of the powerful jet stream thousands of feet above the earth 
that movement is what leads to the death of the storms bleck 
went on cutting off their fuel supply either by moving them over 
land or over cooler ocean waters where there is less evaporation to 
provide them a supply of water 
either way they then lose strength and break down into a loose 
mass of storms still dangerous but without the power of the 
churning hurricane circulation

they met in a tattoo parlor and the next night 
she accused him of raping her then she hired a lawyer for him and 
posted his bail and now they plan to get married 
karen drake now blames pills given to donald farmer the night of 
the may 24 attack 
it wasnt him ms drake said ive talked to people who 
know him and i know him now and hes not the kind of person who 
would do that it was a druginduced stupor the way he acted that 
night 
assistant district attorney colleen marsini moved monday to 
dismiss charges in delaware county just outside philadelphia 
because ms drake would not testify 
i think hes using her ms marsini said tuesday 
ms drake 25 testified in june that she protested when she was 
pinned down and raped by farmer 31 but on monday she said she 
plans to marry him sept 30 in a civil ceremony 
my mother is not opposed to our marriage both of my parents 
deep down love donnie a lot and i get along very well with his 
parents and his two children she said 
both donnie and i have a lot in common she said were 
both from virginia and we both were born in february 
while rape and related offenses were withdrawn farmer did plead 
guilty to stealing a diamond ring from ms drake and was placed on 
two years probation 
defense attorney david breen said ms drake hired him june 3 to 
represent farmer two days after farmers preliminary hearing on the 
rape charges 
she posted bail for him and paid his legal fees its the first 
time ive ever had a victim pay my fee breen said 
ms drake said she met farmer may 23 at a philadelphia tattoo 
parlor where she had gone with a friend and set up a date the next 
night 
i have green eyes and he convinced me to get a tattoo on my 
shoulder of a green eye with a tear ms drake said 
during the june 1 preliminary hearing ms drake testified that 
farmer violated me 
i was scared to death i couldnt move she testified saying 
he pinned her down 
i was too scared to scream she said during that hearing 
but ms drake said she and farmer have lived together since she 
posted his bail after she found out her roommate had given him 
pills that caused the attack 
ms drake said she also received a call from farmers exwife 
who said rape was out of character for him 
immediately i started to cry i went with her the next day to 
the jail when donnie came out he was so shocked he sat down he 
took my two hands he didnt remember anything that happened that 
night he held my hand and said if i did this to you i deserve to 
die 
breen said farmer is undergoing drug rehabilitation 
ms marsini said the drug farmer is said to have taken the night 
of the alleged attack is a painkiller that toxicologists told her is 
a depressant that would not cause a violent reaction 
shes recanted her testimony she said she created the 
situation and caused the problem she said she said he is a 
victim of circumstances 
hes playing on her sensitivity shes very vulnerable 
ms drake discounted that evaluation 
thats her job to say that but thats not the case ms 
drake said 
she said that when the charges were dismissed monday farmer had 
a smile as big as the sky 
he said i feel like i have 100 pounds off of my shoulder 
karen its over we can finally have a life

nasa officials said tuesday they 
would wait a day before deciding whether to move the space shuttle 
atlantis off its launch pad where it could be threatened by 
hurricane hugo 
space agency officials also put off a decision on whether to 
remove a navy communications satellite from an atlascentaur rocket 
on another launch pad 
decisions on both missions were expected tuesday but were 
delayed until wednesday when nasa hopes to know more about hugos 
path 
forrest s mccartney director of the kennedy space center said 
national hurricane center experts told the space officials that the 
path of the storm could stay to the east of cape canaveral 
something in excess of 150 miles 
given the unpredictability of hurricanes thats not assured 
mccartney said 
nasa had begun preparations to move atlantis into an assembly 
building if it appears that the storm might endanger the craft he 
said 
the preparations included disconnecting fuel and electrical lines 
from atlantis and moving a giant tracked vehicle into place to carry 
the spaceplane to the assembly building the giant tractor called a 
crawler moves at a maximum speed of 1 mph and would take at least 
six hours to cover the 42 miles to the building 
the atlantis mission is scheduled for oct 12 when a team of 
five astronauts is to deploy the 14 billion galileo spacecraft for

the kremlins top human rights official took 
issue tuesday with the us definition of soviet emigres as 
refugees saying it creates friction in superpower relations at 
a time when his government is allowing record numbers of citizens to 
leave 
yuri reshetov chief of the department of humanitarian affairs 
and cultural relations at the soviet foreign ministry was in 
washington for talks with the state department preparatory to the 
meeting later this week between soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii 
reshetov said the agenda at the request of the us side would 
include discussion of the cases of several hundred soviet jews 
denied permission to emigrate the two sides will also discuss 
exchange programs for psychiatrists and law enforcement officers he 
said 
in an unusual appearance before the national conference on soviet 
jewry reshetov promised that soviet jews would be allowed to 
practice their religion freely or leave the country if they want 
new draft laws on freedom of religion and on emigration seek to 
create the best possibilities for those who want to live in the 
soviet union but for those who for some reason are unhappy 
and want to leave the best civilized conditions should be 
created he said 
in the first eight months of the year 127000 soviets were 
allowed to emigrate he said about a third of whom came to the 
united states as refugees whose expenses were paid by the us 
government 
speaking to reporters after his speech reshetov criticized the 
us policy of classifying the soviet emigres as refugees saying it 
runs contrary to the definition of refugee accepted by the 
international community 
calling these people refugees creates a considerable 
additional friction in ussoviet relations we are trying to 
do our best to solve the situation but then were portrayed as 
some enemy of mankind from whom all the people are fleeing its not 
a good thing reshetov said 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger addressing the 
conference before reshetov defended the us plan to allot 50000 
of the 125000 worldwide refugee slots in fiscal year 1990 to soviet 
emigres 
despite the unprecedented surge of soviets allowed to emigrate 
and the recent improvement in the lives of those staying behind 
there are still hundreds denied permission to leave and a wave of 
antisemitism has surfaced as a result of the glasnost policies of 
free expression eagleburger said 
given the history of hundreds of years of officially 
sanctioned antisemitism tens of thousands of soviet jews are 
turning to the united states eagleburger said what soviet jews 
are looking for now is a plcae where they can be themselves they 
are not economic migrants 
the united states is a victim of our success now that the 
soviets have acceded to years of us demands to allow free 
emigration he said unfortunately budget constraints place a limit 
on the number of soviets the united states can absorb and other 
countries such as australia canada and israel should share the 
burden he added 
eagleburger promised that baker would bring up us concerns 
about antisemitism in his meeting with shevardnadze and would press 
for enactment of legislation that will institutionalize the reforms 
once such laws are adopted he said the united states will lift 
certain trade restrictions on the soviet union 
reshetov said the kremlin is lobbying the supreme soviet 
which is the soviet legislature to consider the draft laws as soon 
as possible and at least one may be taken up at the coming session 
starting sept 25 
the united states had anticipated the new laws would have been 
enacted already but reshetov said the supreme soviet has other 
items higher on its agenda 
the soviet official said that even without the laws the number 
of people denied emigration dropped from 11000 several years ago to 
2000 the teaching of hebrew and yiddish is allowed in schools and 
three million bibles were recently imported into the soviet union 
reshetov promised that all violators of the ban on antisemitic 
activity would be punished the state department says that despite 
the official outlawing of discrimination against jews antisemitism 
among the lower echelons of the bureacracy and among the general 
population has increased

a judge ordered pennsylvania to provide 756 
million to restore services that had been cut or canceled for more 
than 4000 mentally retarded people living at home in philadelphia 
arguing that cuts in the service had put the retarded people at 
risk of institutionalization commonwealth court judge james 
crumlish jr directed the city to restore the program and said the 
state must pay 90 percent of the costs 
he gave the state department of public welfare until sept 27 to 
ask the legislature to provide the money 
the crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals at 
issue here unable to speak themselves cannot be ignored while the 
intricacies of the general assembly budgetary process unfold 
crumlish said 
the services involved teaching and training the retarded in basic 
life and social skills such as feeding and dressing themselves and 
learning a simple job the ruling applied only to retarded people in 
philadelphia 
the ruling affected only those persons who had received the 
rehabilitative services before they were cut july 1 but attorney 
david ferleger said he hoped that the state recognizes it must also 
provide such services for every retarded person who requests them 
it is a great victory not only in pennsylvania but for 
retarded persons everywhere in this country said ferleger who 
was representing retarded people awaiting services other states 
im sure will begin to provide these services as pennsylvania now 
is required to do 
the lawsuit brought by the city and joined by the philadelphia 
police and fire association for handicapped children was the second 
the state has lost over the philadelphia program during the last 
fiscal year unhappy with deficits in the program the legislature 
tried to withhold the appropriation acquiescing only under court 
order 
vicki smink spokeswoman for the state welfare department said 
no decision on an appeal has been made 
crumlish said the state had continually refused to provide 
sufficient funds in recent years 
this chancellor is deeply troubled by the departments utter 
disregard of the needs of mentally retarded persons and their 
families who depend on nonresidential serevices and programs he 
said 
crumlish said that while the state was at fault the city also 
was to blame for failing to prevent the cutoff of the program by 
seeking additional funds from federal or private sources

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today he hoped to conclude a chemical weapons agreement with the 
soviet union this weekend and make headway on other arms control 
fronts 
baker in his first washington news conference in eight months in 
his job sought to reverse growing criticism in congress and 
elsewhere of the cautious approach president bush is taking in 
response to foreign policy initiatives from moscow 
he accused the senates democratic leader of playing politics 
with the issue 
last week soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who 
will meet with baker in jackson hole wyo on friday and saturday 
accused the administration of timidity on arms control issues 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine said monday 
that the administration had failed to encourage change in the 
eastern bloc and was feeling almost nostalgic about the cold war 
baker replied today the president is rocking along with a 70 
percent approval rating in foreign policy and if i were the senate 
majority leader i might have something like that to say too 
and yet in several of his replies to questions baker stressed 
the cautious stance taken by the administration toward soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would be maintained 
i hope we have been approaching this relationship with a proper 
degree of prudence he said 
in this regard baker lowered expectations that he would set a 
date with shevardnadze for a summit meeting between bush and 
gorbachev he said only that the subject would be thoroughly 
discussed at jackson hole 
baker said any increases in us assistance to poland and 
hungary which are veering away from a marxist economy depended on 
the changes undertaken in the two east european countries we 
shouldnt be mistaken and think us aid could overcome their 
problems he said 
and baker said it was the soviets turn to move on reducing 
troops and nonnuclear armaments in europe 
on negotiating arms control with moscow baker said we have to 
be careful not to become frantic 
however baker said he would propose to shevardnadze ways to 
break a 15year impasse on verifying the size of us and soviet 
underground nuclear tests 
in addition he said we have i think a reasonable shot at an 
agreement to exchange data on chemical stocks which i think is a 
first practical step toward achieving real controls and eventually a 
total ban 
on another arms control front baker said the administration no 
longer would seek a ban on us and soviet longrange mobile 
missiles he urged congress to provide funds for development of the 
singlewarhead midgetman 
the move is of limited significance the reagan administration 
had taken the position it favored a ban only if the elimination of 
all us and soviet mobile missiles could be verified and no 
headway was made on the issue in negotiations in geneva 
baker said continued soviet weapons shipments to leftist 
nicaragua will be a priority issue in his discussions with 
shevardnadze 
were a little disappointed in whats going on down there 
baker said referring to the role of the soviets and other east bloc 
countries in building up the sandinistas military arsenal 
he said most of the soviet weaponry arrives in nicaragua via 
third countries and the soviets could put a stop to the practice if 
they so chose

a survey of sheep ranchers shows that flocks 
are less likely to be attacked by coyotes wild dogs and other 
predators if a burly guard dog is on watch the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
the departments agricultural research service said that 
scientists began studying guard dogs 10 years ago at the us sheep 
experiment station in dubois idaho 
at that time the dogs were considered a novelty jeffrey s 
green a wildlife biologist at the station said in a report by the 
agency livestock producers who had guard dogs were thought to be 
foolish brave desperate or a combination of all three today much 
of the skepticism is gone 
green and his colleagues sent out 1000 questionnaires to 
ranchers and farmers who rely on the dogs to safeguard sheep cattle 
and goats 
more than 80 percent of the 399 who responded said a guard dog 
was well worth its initial cost of about 500 plus the dollar or 
two a day it takes to feed them green reported 
the dogs weight 100 to 120 pounds and come from several breeds 
great pyerenees komondor akbash and anatolian green estimates 
that over the last decade as many as 8000 of the guard dogs have 
been used on 4000 ranches throughout the united states and canada

a state appeals court today stripped new zealand 
of the americas cup and gave the trophy back to the san diego yacht 
club 
the supreme courts appellate division reversed a lower court 
ruling april 7 that stripped san diego of yacht racings most 
coveted prize for using a catamaran or twohull vessel instead of 
a singlehull boat in winning a 1988 match 
the appeals court said that the catamaran was legal and that the 
san diego club is entitled to the americas cup 
supreme court justice carmen ciparick had ruled in april that the 
bestofthree race between the new zealand a yacht about 90 feet at 
the water line sailed by the mercury bay boating club and the stars 
and stripes a 60foot catamaran sailed by the san diego group was 
a gross mismatch and unfair 
ciparick found that competing vessels must be somewhat evenly 
matched in americas cup competition and that using a lighter 
faster catamaran violated the spirit of the international 
competition 
but in its 41 decision today the appeals court said ciparick had 
on her own pronounced a rule that is neither expressed nor implied 
in the deed of gift the 102yearold document that governs the race 
the squabbling began in july 1987 when auckland businessman 
michael fay on behalf of the mercury bay boating club ignored 
modern americas cup tradition and demanded a oneonone match with 
a san diego defender 
fay wanted the race held within one year rather than the usual 
three to four he wanted a oneonone race instead of the usual 
elimination matches and he wanted to compete in a boat more than 90 
feet long at the water line instead of the usual yachts that are 
about 45 feet at the water line 
san diego rejected the challenge but fay went to court when san 
diego was ordered to accept the challenge it also went to an 
unconventional boat the speedy catamaran 
the san diego yacht club became trustee of the cup in 1987 after 
skipper dennis conner sailed the 12meter yacht stars amp stripes to 
victory over the australian defender kookaburra iii in waters off 
fremantle australia 
the victory returned the cup to america after conners 1983 loss 
to the australians ended a 132year us winning streak

the widely publicized flood of east german refugees 
to the west has energized the fledgling prodemocracy movement they 
left behind giving it a new boldness to challenge east germanys 
hardline government 
just two weeks after its creation a dissident group called neues 
forum says its numbers have swelled from 30 founders to more than 
1500 supporters nationwide 
neues forum says it has also received inquiries from a number of 
lowlevel communist party members and on tuesday asked the 
government to legalize it 
for too long people have only dared to express their hopes in 
places like bars where its safe its time we start talking about 
these things out in the open said 27yearold klaus a group 
member who asked that his last name not be used because of possible 
police reprisals 
erich honeckers hardline communist government staunchly rejects 
the kinds of reforms under way in the soviet union hungary and 
poland saying there is no need for them in east germany 
neues forum which means new forum is demanding that east 
germanys rulers heed the call for reforms and that the group be 
legalized by the government 
we want to keep whatever has been proven but at the same time 
create room for renewal says the groups founding charter 
at one founding members east berlin apartment the telephone 
rang frequently as people called seeking information about neues 
forum several east berliners knocked on the door with the same 
request 
the response has far exceeded our expectations said rolf 
henrich another founding member of neues forum who was kicked out 
of the communist party earlier this year for criticizing the 
government 
other new prodemocracy groups are springing up as well with a 
meeting of activists from across east germany tentatively planned 
for sometime next month 
its not clear how many people belong to such groups and how many 
have expressed interest 
west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper tuesday quoted 
east berlin lutheran rev rainer eppelmann as saying in an interview 
that there are about 500 prodemocracy church groups with 
memberships ranging from 10 to 100 
the citizens movement for democracy now was founded last week by 
12 people including lutheran church pastors scientists and human 
rights activists the group says it now has a few hundred members 
another proreform group liste 2 was recently founded in dresden 
neues forum says the exodus of thousands of east germans to the 
west should be a signal to communist authorities that something must 
be done soon about widespread discontent and despair among east 
german citizens 
people who contact us say they have faced the question whether 
to also leave or stay and try to get something done one of the 
groups founders east german artist baerbel bohley said on west 
german ard television monday 
among those making contact with neues forum are disillusioned 
communist party members the groups leaders say 
it is believed there is a growing desire among lower party 
echelons for political and economic reforms but that people at the 
top refuse to listen 
people contact us saying they have directed a stateowned 
business for 20 years and have ideas for economic changes they say 
that for a long time they have made suggestions to the central 
committee but there was simply no reply ms bohley said 
ms bohley was not interviewed by ard instead ard filmed her 
while she was talking on the telephone with a reporter calling from 
a west german radio station ard said it was not permitted by state 
authorities to interview ms bohley in east berlin 
neues forum on tuesday submitted official applications to 
communist authorities in districts across east germany seeking to be 
legalized 
the groups chances for official approval do not look promising 
about 100 activists including neues forum members were arrested 
after a prayer service at leipzigs nikolai church on monday night 
they included michael arnold leipzig coordinator for neues 
forum arnold and the others were released the next afternoon 
but activists say they will keep up their efforts for change 
whether neues forum is legalized or not saying the only alternative 
for east germans is continued frustration and despair 
henrich one of the neues forum founders told a gathering of 
activists in east berlin on monday night that a congress of all 
prodemocracy groups is planned for sometime next month to 
formulate common goals 
everyone agrees on one thing things cannot go on as they are 
in the german democratic republic east germany he said 
nearly 17000 people have fled east germany since sept 10 when 
hungary defied its hardline warsaw pact ally and orchestrated a 
mass migration to the west by east germans vacationing in hungary

a coalition of prochoice lawmakers 
tuesday proposed legislation designed to strengthen womens rights 
to abortion in pennsylvania and to preempt a planned attempt to 
toughen existing laws restricting abortion 
pennsylvania is widely viewed as a key battleground state 
following the us supreme court decision in july that gave states 
more leeway in addressing the abortion issue historically the 
state general assembly has overwhelmingly approved bills restricting 
abortions but many of the provisions have been struck down in court 
the new ninebill package includes measures calling for a state 
constitutional amendment giving women the right to an abortion 
restoring statesubsidized funding for all medically necessary 
abortions and wiping out an existing law requiring rape and incest 
victims to file a police report before receiving subsidized 
abortions 
the centerpiece bill sponsored by state rep karen ritter says 
government should not interfere with a womans personal choice to 
commence prevent or continue a pregnancy or have an abortion 
before the fetus is viable 
the proposal mirrors existing law in saying an abortion on a 
viable fetus is allowed only if the mothers life or health is 
threatened by the pregnancy under the proposal a fetus is 
considered viable if the womans doctor rules there is a 
reasonable likelihood of sustained survival outside the womans 
uterus 
in an attempt to placate some abortion opponents ms ritter said 
the bill would also require doctors to ask teenage patients to 
notify at least one parent before having an abortion if that is not 
feasible the doctor must recommend that the teenager discuss the 
matter with another relative school counselor or another adult 
this bill represents mainstream america and the opinion of an 
overwhelming majority of pennsylvania citizens as well that 
government has no business invading the privacy of peoples lives 
ms ritter said at a news conference 
the bills are scheduled to be introduced simultaneously in the 
house and senate on oct 2 abortion foes led by state rep stephen 
freind are scheduled to introduce legislation outlining further 
restrictions on oct 3 
this is the first attempt in several years to offer an organized 
prochoice package of bills ms ritter and others acknowledged the 
proposals would face tough opposition in both chambers but she said 
the public generally supports a womans right to an abortion even 
though many legislators do not 
freind said the parental notification in ms ritters bill 
weakens what already is in pennsylvania law but is under court 
challenge the law now requires that a parent be notified or the 
minor obtain a court order before having an abortion 
he also said prochoice advocates want to restore the pre1985 
situation of taxfunded birth control by abortion on demand that 
wont happen 
legislation enacted in the early 1980s and upheld by the courts 
after years of legal battles restricted medicaid funding for 
abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the mothers 
life was at stake 
abortion already is an issue in the 1990 governors race likely 
gop nominee barbara hafer is prochoice incumbent democrat robert 
p casey opposes abortion 
freind has said his bills will deal with such issues as requiring 
spousal notification before an abortion is performed and banning 
socalled sexselection abortions 
he said he didnt regard the prochoice announcement as an 
attempt to upstage his efforts 
nobody takes us out of our game plan he said this is one 
more battle that has to be won its one more battle that will be 
won and take us one step closer to the day when the sanctity of all 
human life is protected in pennsylvania

aids patients in san francisco are taking an 
average of five drugs and unapproved treatments without telling 
their doctors posing a risk of potentially fatal drug interactions 
a survey has found 
one patient admitted using 25 treatments said dr ruth 
greenblatt of the university of california san francisco she 
described her findings tuesday at a meeting of the american society 
for microbiology 
there is a significant minority who have a background belief 
that new experimental drugs may have more benefit than drugs already 
available she said 
the hidden use of aids drugs also makes it difficult for 
scientists to determine which drugs have toxic side effects 
patients receiving only the recommended approved treatments for 
infection with the aids virus or hiv would normally not be receiving 
more than one or two drugs unless they were very sick then they 
might be given up to five drugs greenblatt said 
dr kenneth dunnigan medical director of a citysupported aids 
clinic in san francisco said he was a bit surprised at how many 
drugs patients were taking but said he was fully supportive of 
people with hiv using alternative therapies 
i also believe care is difficult if we only have bits and 
pieces of information about what patients are taking dunnigan 
said he is on the board of the community research alliance a san 
francisco group studying alternative treatments 
greenblatts survey found that 37 percent of the patients were 
getting prescriptions from a second doctor and 28 percent were using 
treatments not approved by the food and drug administration 
the use of fdaunapproved treatments was common and increased 
with the severity of illness greenblatt said 
the only governmentapproved drug to treat aids is azt several 
other drugs are available for the treatment of aidsrelated 
infections 
the alternative treatments most widely used by patients in the 
survey included megadoses of vitamin c and the unapproved aids drugs 
al721 and dextran sulfate one patient was getting injections of 
fetal sheep blood 
other doctors familiar with the survey were surprised at how many 
drugs patients were getting from other doctors and alternative 
sources such as communityorganized trials of unapproved drugs 
aids patients have more toxic drug reactions than do other 
patients greenblatt said because of the clandestine use of 
multiple drugs it can be hard to sort out which medications are 
causing these toxicities she said 
the hidden use of approved and unapproved aids drugs is 
complicating scientific research because subjects in the studies 
are not disclosing their use of other drugs dunnigan said 
in some cases disclosing that use might result in their being 
dropped from the study losing access to medical care associated 
with the study he said 
there are two sides he said from the physicians point of 
view in order to get good data there needs to be some rigor in how 
the drugs are used but from a clients point of view theres so 
little that can be done and the clock keeps ticking 
greenblatt said patients who use unapproved treatments are not 
discharged from her clinic but are advised to tell their doctors 
what drugs they are taking 
i dont think you can ask people to not take something they 
think will help them greenblatt said thats my personal 
opinion but you can ask them to let you know 
the key to avoiding problems is a partnership between doctors and 
their patients dunnigan said in which patients feel free to 
disclose which drugs theyre taking 
hopefully that agreement would be made before therapy is 
initiated he said 
the survey which began last fall and will continue for two more 
years consists of 30minute to 60minute interviews with each 
patient every three months patients are asked about their use of 
various medical services in addition to drug use greenblatt said

a womans dying wish to leave behind an 
unimpeded view of the shore by having her house leveled was denied 
tuesday by a judge who called the will request a waste of money 
superior court judge thomas needham threw out a portion of ethel 
turners will that instructed the city of cranston to raze the old 
home and use the property as a right of way to providence river 
to destroy the house would be to commit substantial waste of 
this estate needham said i declare the provision is void as 
being contrary to public policy 
rhode island hospital trust executor of the womans estate did 
not want the nineroom home razed and challenged the will in june 
when needham heard arguments from lawyers 
in 1973 the victorianqueen anne home built in the 1890s was 
made a national historic site along with the rest of the 
neighborhood neighbors and the city also opposed leveling the house 
and filling in the basement as requested in the will 
ms turner died in april 1986 at age 86 the will left 5000 to 
the city to maintain the right of way the providence river leads to 
narragansett bay 
needham said the area would not be served by tearing down the 
house among 14 million in assets left by the woman her wealth 
was mostly in stocks and bonds 
david riedel hospital trusts lawyer said the ruling made a 
lot of sense 
he added no one wants to see a nice house destroyed but on 
the other hand some people would feel you ought to be able to do 
whatever you want in the will 
needham ruled the home should be sold he said an appeal of his 
decision is unlikely the exact value of the house is unknown but 
real estate agents said waterfront homes in the area were selling 
for 400000 and more

two drug addicts from the district of columbia 
have been admitted to a donated treatment program in alabama that 
could be a model for programs elsewhere in the nation government 
and private drug abuse officials announced tuesday 
this effort has brought a cooperative spirit to the district 
that could well be recreated in communities across the nation 
said dr herbert d kleber deputy director for demand reduction in 
the office of national drug control policy we need everybody to 
follow this example of private and public cooperation to win this 
war 
the two unidentified adult men who left washington last 
wednesday to be admitted to a facility of the bradford group in 
birmingham ala are the first of 70 that the private drug and 
alcohol treatment organization has said it will accept in the first 
year of its new program 
bradford a company operated for profit has had a policy of 
making unused beds available to uninsured addicts in the birmingham 
area and announced on may 23 that it would extend the program to the 
nations capital 
patients for the treatment slots are selected by a committee of 
private citizens working under auspices of the washington area 
council on alcoholism and drug abuse 
joseph l wright executive director of the council said the 
patients must be residents of the district must have a 
significant person to help them with decisions must have no 
criminal charges pending against them although they may have 
criminal records must certify that no insurance company or third 
party will pay for the cost and must not have been through a drug 
treatment program before 
wright said there is a considerable waiting list although he 
said he did not know the number waiting 
chip burson a spokesman for bradford said most patients would 
stay from 30 to 45 days 
after that wright said they are to receive two years of 
followup treatment in the district which they agree to pay for 
through some form of community service 
wright said the council is negotiating with three treatment 
groups in the washington suburbs that have approached it about 
similar programs

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday won an 
opportunity to revamp the communist party by scheduling a party 
congress next year that could hasten the pace of economic reforms 
and change the kremlin leadership 
gorbachev also made an emotional plea for calm among ethnic 
groups in the increasingly restive caucasus and baltic republics 
we cannot allow anarchy much less bloodshed he said on state 
television 
he also condemned secessionist movements in the baltics and 
georgia saying people demanding independence are demagogues 
currently the work of party bodies and organizations is in 
many ways fettered by old structures and outdated rules and 
instructions gorbachev told the partys 251member central 
committee in obtaining its approval for moving up the date of the 
party meeting to october 1990 
the congress with 5000 delegates theoretically is the partys 
most powerful body it can set broad policy guidelines and it is 
the only body that can promote communists to the central committee 
which makes major decisions in the five years between congresses 
historically the congress also sets the fiveyear plan for the 
economy by party rules the next congress the 28th in the partys 
history must be held by early 1991 moving up the date will allow 
gorbachev to make economic reforms sooner and to increase the number 
of supporters on the central committee 
the move came at a closed meeting of the central committee 
dedicated to solving the nations ethnic disputes which have led to 
more than 200 deaths in the past 19 months and threaten soviet 
stability and unity 
in remarks later shown on state television gorbachev said 
nationalist disputes must be resolved peacefully he rejected 
demands for boundary changes between the countrys 15 republics he 
said such changes cannot solve conflicts when 60 million people or 
almost onefifth of the soviet population of 285 million live 
outside their native territories 
gorbachev also used the speech to denounce critics on both the 
right and left who assail his reform campaign known as 
perestroika or restructuring 
they are telling us that we cant solve the countrys problems 
without moving to capitalism he said another theme coming 
from the right is that everything we suggest the policy of 
perestroika is an action the west succeeded in planting in forcing 
on us thats rubbish 
the last party congress was held in february 1986 less than a 
year after gorbachev took power he succeeded in replacing 41 
percent of the voting members of the central committee appointees 
of former president leonid i brezhnev however remained a 
significant force 
in april another 83 of the then 301 voting members resigned and 
a number of candidate members were promoted to full membership 
entitling them to vote on issues brought before the body 
the congress agenda approved tuesday includes a report on the 
progress of gorbachevs economic social and political reforms a 
review of party rules and the election of new governing bodies 
presumably including the central committee itself and the 12member 
politburo 
gorbachev 58 expressed concern that the party is lagging behind 
the political reforms he has set in motion including the shift of 
more power to elected government bodies real life the 
reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we often 
cannot catch up with them he said 
we cannot leave things as they are especially since 
fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an 
ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of 
social development gorbachev said 
some party stalwarts have said they fear the communist party 
enshrined by the constitution as the countrys leading force is 
losing its grip on political power as the legislature grows stronger 
and frustrated citizens sometimes take matters into their own hands 
gorbachev also said the party must adopt a new program and rules 
a new program was adopted at the last congress replacing a 
khrushchevera document that had served for more than 20 years 
ethnic disputes in many soviet republics have disrupted 
gorbachevs drive to reform society on the eve of the central 
committee meeting armenian activists appealed to moscow to order an 
end to what they call an economic blockade imposed on their caucasus 
mountain republic by neighboring azerbaijan 
the official tass news agency reported tuesday that two policeman 
were killed by a mob a day earlier in an azerbaijani village on a 
blocked road to nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian enclave of the 
republic armenia has claimed the region 
in tashkent uzbekistan a weekend friendship carnival 
degenerated into mob violence that included a sexual assault on a 
girl in the subway and the siege of an interior ministry building 
tass said 
in the baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia 
communist officials have joined in varying degrees with informal 
political movements that demand sovereignty from moscow

senate democrats contending the bush 
administration is missing the boat on the surging reform 
movements in poland and hungary on tuesday proposed a 18 billion 
aid package that would dwarf the assistance offered by the white 
house 
accusing president bush of timidity and a failure of 
leadership sen alan cranston dcalif said the democrats 
threeyear proposal would be addressed by the senate foreign 
relations committee on wednesday with the aim of getting it before 
the senate quickly 
sen paul simon dill called the proposal a gamble for 
freedom and said it would help polands new noncommunist 
government build a free economic market and democratic institutions 
the aid package would authorize 423 million in the 1990 fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 and 381 million in each of the next two years 
president bush initially proposed a onetime 100 million aid 
package for poland and last week proposed an additional 50 million 
in food assistance 
the centerpiece of the democratic proposal is the establishment 
of a 300 millionayear enterprise fund over the next three 
years to support free enterprise economic development in poland 
the plan also would authorize spending 75 million in each of the 
next three years to establish a similar fund for hungary 
cranston said the proposal calls for skimming the money from the 
40 billion spent by the pentagon each year for research and 
development 
the bill which combines elements of the administrations aid 
proposals with proposals by congressional democrats has these other 
major elements 
authorizes the extension of overseas private investment corp 
guarantees to us businesses investing in poland and hungary 
authorizes the extension of trade preference benefits to poland 
authorizes 11 million in scientific and education exchanges 
along with medical assistance and help in building democratic 
institutions for poland and hungary 
authorizes 25 million to help modernize polands 
telecommunications system 
authorizes 3 million for peace corps activities in poland and 
hungary 
directs the president to encourage debt for equity swaps and 
debt rescheduling negotiations to help poland deal with its massive 
foreign debt 
authorizes the president to pursue other initiatives including 
a possible airlift of food to poland 
we need a substantive economic commitment of enduring support 
for free market mechanisms and democratic institutions in poland and 
hungary a commitment on the scope and duration of the marshall 
plan which helped western europe rebuild after world war ii 
cranston said 
i am convinced it is in americas interest to help these 
struggling nations move away from the failed policies of the past 
and to move to a brighter future under pluralism democracy and free 
markets he said 
cranston said it would be tragic for the united states to be 
excessively cautious for the white house to mistake the status quo 
for stability 
the democratic proposal came one day after senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine called the bush administrations aid 
package for poland and hungary niggardly and urged the president to 
quickly go beyond symbolic nods and meager gestures

the attorney general should not be empowered to 
appeal a judges secrecy order in trials being conducted by 
independent counsels irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh told 
congress on tuesday 
walsh appointed an independent counsel in 1986 to investigate 
the irancontra affair urged the house intelligence legislative 
affairs subcommittee against adopting legislation to specifically 
give the attorney general such power under the classified 
information procedures act 
the independent counsel speaking to reporters after the closed 
hearing noted that the attorney general already has the power to 
file a court affidavit blocking a trial if he feels disclosure of 
certain secrets in open court would endanger national security 
but walsh who was forced to jettison three major conspiracy 
charges against former white house aide oliver l north because of 
the governments refusal to release certain classified information 
said the attorney general should not be allowed to appeal 
trialcourt rulings on secrecy in cases conducted by special 
prosecutors 
to do so would undermine the independence of special prosecutors 
said walsh 
if the attorney general feels that a case should be interrupted 
to protect classified information that should be a cleancut act 
which the public can understand and for which he takes political 
responsiblity walsh said in an allusion to the justice 
departments response to secrecy problems arising from his 
prosecution of a former cia agent 
hes not in there to tinker with it and he should not come in 
unless he wants to kill the case walsh said 
in a report to the committee released after the hearing walsh 
pointedly noted that attorney general dick thornburgh threatened to 
file an affidavit preventing disclosure of secrets in the trial of 
former cia station chief joseph fernandez 
as jury selection was set to begin on july 24 thornburgh instead 
sought a stay of the trial while he appealed the judges ruling that 
the details of three cia programs in costa rica and the locations of 
cia stations in latin america could be disclosed in court 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond is now 
considering whether the attorney general has right to appeal such a 
ruling the appellate court has stayed the trial of fernandez 
accused of lying about his role in setting up a clandestine arms 
resupply network for the nicaraguan contras 
walsh also urged the panel to adopt legislation requiring the 
attorney general to notify the intelligence committees of congress 
so those panels would be able to look at the socalled secret 
information to see whether its a true secret 
the basic controversy is as to matters which are classified but 
which are publicly known walsh said 
there are some matters which even though the public knows it 
the intelligence agencies wish to keep classified and not release 
even for use at trial even though it may mean that the trial has to 
be dropped walsh said 
before the trial of north who was convicted of three irancontra 
coverup charges intelligence agencies objected to the 
identification of countries that helped arm the nicaraguan contras 
similar secrecy problems have arisen in the fernandez case even 
though some of the same secrets were disclosed in norths trial 
walsh said that the intelligence agencies are apparently 
concerned that in the framework of the fernandez case it might 
get into much more nittygritty detail 
while i recognize these problems but to defeat a case to 
protect that rather abstract concern seems to me going too far 
walsh said 
rep matthew f mchugh dny the subcommittee chairman said 
the panel may draft some legislation but first wants to hear 
testimony from thornburgh whom he said has refused so far to 
discuss the issue

cigarette production is declining this year and 
so is the average smoking rate among americans for the 16th 
consecutive year the agriculture department said tuesday 
total output is expected to drop from last years 695 billion 
cigarettes because of higher prices health concerns and smoking 
restrictions the departments economic research service said in its 
report 
cigarette use may drop about 35 percent from last years average 
of 3096 cigarettes or fewer than 155 packs of 20 each the report 
said 
the average is for all americans 18 years and older smokers and 
nonsmokers alike it is a statistical comparison only and does not 
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population 
cigarette smoking peaked in 1963 at an average of 4345 more 
than 217 packs before beginning its longtime downward trend 
total us tobacco production this year is up about 9 percent 
from 1988 mostly because of an increased acreage the report said 
even with the larger crop and the continuing decline in us 
cigarette consumption fluecured the most abundant type of us 
tobacco auction prices are higher than a year ago the report 
said the higher prices result from tightening supplies because of 
reduced carryin old inventories a relatively good quality crop 
and higher price supports 
analysts said that prospects for world tobacco use next season 
indicated a small increase in sales and use of cigarettes and 
unmanufactured tobacco us exports of unmanufactured tobacco 
leaf may rise a little from last season

irancontra prosecutors made an irreparable 
mistake by failing to get justice department permission before 
launching a perjury probe of richard secords testimony to congress 
his lawyer said tuesday 
us district court judge aubrey robinson said secord was raising 
a significant legal issue but rejected as too timeconsuming an 
attempt to delay the trial so that an appeals court panel could 
issue an advisory opinion 
were looking at about a year if such a course were pursued 
said the judge 
at a hearing tuesday secords attorney thomas green said all 
nine criminal counts pertaining to secords congressional tstimony 
should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction robinson said near the 
end of the court hearing that this case is going to go to trial 
i think 
secord the retired air force major general enlisted by oliver 
north to run arms to the contras and assist in the reagan 
administrations secret iran initiative is accused of obstructing 
congress perjury and making false statements his trial is 
scheduled to begin nov 13 
the government says secord lied when he denied taking money out 
of the companies he and iranianborn businessman albert hakim used 
in the irancontra initiative prosecutors allege secord took over a 
million dollars in profits 
green argued that independent counsel lawrence walsh was required 
under the ethics in government act to get an expanded mandate from 
the attorney general before launching the probe of secords 1987 
testimony to the irancontra committees of congress 
walsh was appointed in december 1986 and i think the 
independent counsel made an irreparable mistake in not going back to 
the attorney general seeking to expand the investigative mandate 
before delving into secords congressional testimony green said 
associate independent counsel reid weingarten said the intent of 
the appeals court panel appointing the irancontra prosecutor was to 
allow wide latitude in the investigation 
its hard to imagine a broader grant of jurisdiction 
weingarten said of the appeals court panels mandate 
the court on dec 19 1986 appointed walsh to look into alleged 
crimes in the irancontra affair committed in or about 1984 down 
to the present it also authorized the independent counsel to 
prosecute any other alleged crime committed by north or others when 
the allegations are connected with or arising out of walshs 
investigation 
secord also is accused of three counts of conspiring offering 
and paying illegal gratuities to north 
in a recent interview on the fox television program the 
reporters secord said he has suffered financially due to the 
irancontra scandal 
were about as close to being broke as you can come secord 
of his family he said he had to pull two of his children out of 
college because we just couldnt continue to support that 
asked in the tv interview about his allegedly having pulled in 
more than a million dollars in profits from the irancontra scandal 
secord responded 
if i had done that i wouldnt be in the financial bind now 
its just pure myth 
on monday secord was convicted of driving while intoxicated in 
suburban virginia his second drunken driving conviction since may 
he is appealing both convictions

whose jaw was destroyed by a drug users shotgun a decade ago told 
senators tuesday the nation needs strong death penalty laws 
the problem i see with the death penalty is the lengthy appeals 
process wanda summers of pawleys island sc told the senate 
judiciary committee which is considering measures to increase the 
number of crimes that could result in death sentences under federal 
law 
senators commended mrs summers for bravery in telling the story 
of the feb 22 1979 murder spree by two men that left four dead 
she and a fellow worker at a convenience store were taken to a 
deserted road raped and shotgunned she testified 
her assailant ronald woomer left her for dead mrs summers 
said actually she turned her head at the moment of the shotgun 
blast which blew away part of her mouth and her jaw despite her 
wound she was able find help but her coworker died in the 
incident 
the two assailants were found the same night in a myrtle beach 
motel one of them eugene skaar committed suicide woomer was 
captured convicted of murder and sentenced to death he has been on 
death row ever since as the appeals process has continued 
mrs summers said she has been helped by reconstructive surgery 
and psychiatric care but added that it is hard to get up in the 
morning and look in the mirror 
its hard when little kids stare at you and adults try not to 
its hard to smile when you know how you look when you do 
she was asked by sen strom thurmond rsc a sponsor of the 
death penalty legislation if she considered life in prison 
sufficient punishment even for those who commit heinous crimes 
i believe the terrible crimes he committed do warrant the death 
sentence she said he did not give the four other people the 
option of life or death 
south carolina state solicitor james c anders testified that the 
two killers were drugged up on pcp and alcohol 
congress as part of last years antidrug legislation approved 
capital punishment for drug kingpins whose racketeering activities 
result in death 
a 1972 supreme court decision however blocked use of a number 
of death penalty provisions on the books at that time calling 
unconstitutional the discretion the law allowed juries and judges on 
whether to impose death or not 
at the hearing assistant attorney general edward sg dennis 
told senators that under current law a jury can impose the death 
penalty for the murder of a drug enforcement agent investigating a 
case but not for the murder of an fbi agent responding to a bank 
robbery 
legislation before the committee would restore the death penalty 
for murdering a member of congress the cabinet or the supreme court 
to espionage it would extend capital punishment provisions to 
murdering foreign officials and official guests kidnapping 
resulting in death attempted presidential assassination murder for 
hire and murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise

coastal dwellers from florida to massachusetts nervously watched 
the progress of hurricane hugo on tuesday hoping it would spin 
harmlessly out to sea but fearing the worst 
weve just been inundated with calls about preparedness said 
dan summers who coordinates emergency operations in new hanover 
county nc one of the places considered most vulnerable to the 
storm 
forecasters at the national hurricane center in florida said it 
was too early to tell whether hugo might turn toward the northwest 
and take aim at the us mainland or veer eastward and churn out 
into the atlantic 
it is definitely a potential threat people in the united 
states should be monitoring this storm said meteorologist jesse 
moore at the hurricane center any time you have a hurricane with 
winds of 105 mph or more possibly coming ashore in the beachfront 
areas you have the potential for a great deal of damage 
if it does assault the eastern seaboard possibly as early as 
friday hugo could land anywhere from florida to massachusetts 
forecasters said with north carolina getting votes as the most 
likely target 
hurricane center director bob sheets said he expects to issue a 
hurricane watch wednesday from south florida to cape hatteras nc 
with the east coast likely to feel the hurricanes effects in two to 
three days 
hopefully well be able to narrow that somewhat tomorrow 
sheets said 
emergency officials up and down the coast began making plans for 
the hurricane although most said it was too early to take any 
defensive action 
right now were just watching the storm said robert smith 
of the norfolk va office of emergency services tomorrow well 
be having a meeting with the shelter managers school 
superintendants and others to review the procedures 
in georgia atlanta red cross spokeswoman ann willcox said all 
emergency workers had been placed on standby alert and officials 
were contacting volunteers to make sure they are prepared to help 
out in a disaster 
and in florida nasa officials fretted about the space shuttle 
atlantis sitting on its pad at cape canaveral in preparation for an 
october launch space agency officials decided to wait until 
wednesday before deciding whether to pull the spacecraft back into 
the safety of its hangar a tedious procedure that could delay its 
flight 
the american red cross ordered food and made lastminute 
preparations to open 58 shelters in miami and 23 in fort lauderdale 
and several radio stations in central florida planned to activate 
storm tracking hotlines to keep residents up to date 
florida disaster worker lee barnett said he was assuming the 
worst and hoping for the best 
farther north officials in new york and massachusetts said they 
were just keeping track of the storm and hoping their states werent 
on its itinerary 
for those in charge of emergency agencies preparations for a 
hurricane can include stocking schools and evacuation centers with 
food notifying residents of evacuation plans and shoring up 
vulnerable structures 
preprations for individual coastal residents are much the same 
martin nelson a meteorologist at the national hurricane center 
said anyone in hugos path should stock up on nonperishable food 
flashlight batteries and drinking water and should make sure their 
car has plenty of gas 
boatowners should bring their vessels ashore if possible and 
residents closest to the water especially those in mobile homes 
should be ready to evacuate pet owners need to find places for 
their animals which usually arent allowed at evacuation shelters 
nelson had warnings for the socially minded and the adventurous 
he said those in the hurricanes path shouldnt plan hurricane 
parties and no one should venture outside if they are in the eye of 
a hurricane

the house republican leader said tuesday that 
the barney frank case was becoming a stain upon the house of 
representatives as allies of the embattled democrat tried to 
quell suggestions he was near resignation 
frank a liberal who disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 has 
come under scrutiny since acknowledging a twoyear relationship with 
a male prostitute whom he paid for sex and then hired as a personal 
assistant 
rep robert michel rill asserted that the massachusetts 
democrat was benefiting from a double standard that would have dealt 
more harshly with other members of congress in similar circumstances 
if it were anyone other than barney frank if i were to have 
a woman prostitute in my employ for my own self gratification id 
be run out of town michel said 
at franks own request the house ethics committee is 
investigating his involvement with stephen l gobie and gobies 
disputed claim that the congressman was aware he was operating a 
prostitution service out of franks capitol hill apartment frank 
has said he would await the ethics committees inquiry 
michel answering questions at a news conference said he was 
distressed to have anything of that nature become a stain up on 
the house of representatives 
democratic national chairman ron brown in a breakfast meeting 
with reporters acknowledged frank was under pressure to resign but 
said the congressman was right to await the ethics committee inquiry 
hes done what he should have done brown said the ethics 
committee ought to go forward pressure is building to resign but 
we ought to let the quasijudicial process go forward 
asked if frank had become an embarrassment to the democratic 
party brown said no dont think so there have been issues like 
this for years in poitics but i think we should let the 
quasijudicial process take over and then we can make some 
recommendations 
frank meanwhile sought to carry out normal congressional duties 
while declining to discuss his case with reporters 
frank attended a morning subcommittee meeting without speaking 
publicly he had normal office appointments in the afternoon said 
his administrative assistant doug cahn 
gobie franks accuser breathed fresh life into the story by 
recounting his version of their relationship in the airing tuesday 
of a videotaped appearance on the television program geraldo 
house majority leader richard gephardt also cited the ethics 
comittee when asked about frank 
i dont think we should try people outside of that process 
gephardt dmo said 
close political allies of frank contended he is not weighing an 
immediate resignation despite the boston globes editorial call for 
his resignation and private suggestions from political sources that 
he was considering such a move 
frank said over the weekend he would step aside if he decided his 
case was hurting the liberal causes he has worked for 
ann lewis franks sister and a washington political consultant 
said frank was wrestling with the question of whether he might not 
seek reelection because of diminished effectiveness but would not 
resign before the ethics committee probe was carried out 
a massachusetts ally of frank democratic rep joe moakley 
described the continuing disclosures about frank as like chinese 
water torture but defended franks decision to await the ethics 
committee review 
some people may resign and cut their losses but i think its 
up to the individual member whos being charged moakley said 
this may very well be the thing barney frank is remembered for in 
congress its like when former ways and means committee chairman 
wilbur mills had his tryst with the dancer and ended up in the tidal 
basin 
dan payne franks longtime media consultant in boston said 
frank did not intend to resign before the ethics committee acts and 
reacted angrily to growing speculation in washington political 
circles about franks fate 
theres no way barneys going to let this end without getting 
his day in the ethics committee payne said 
i think it would be a mistake to resign because the political 
kibitzing industry says he should payne said its really sick 
almost that people are now engaged in trying to provide the 
definitive wisecrack about barney 
payne said franks support within his district remains strong 
frank has become the focus of intense media coverage of his 
personal life including his current longterm relationship with a 
male friend in a reaction to the intensity of coverage frank has 
declined press interviews about his case this week although he 
conducted several last week 
reaction to franks case has been divided within washingtons 
homosexual community although franks decision to reveal his sexual 
preference two years ago made him a visible symbol of a politically 
successful gay person who has acknowledged his homosexuality 
the washington blade a gay newspaper in washington last week 
published two letters from writers who said frank should resign 
including one writer who said he owes all gays an apology for his 
stupidity

humberto giffuni deputy director of the judicial technical 
police said the man who he did not identify would be released

the library of congress announced tuesday the 
first 25 american movie classics to be placed on the new national 
film registry as culturally historically or esthetically 
significant treasures in the art form of filmmaking 
the list was heavy with popular academy awardwinning titles 
from the best years of our lives to the wizard of oz it 
included one documentary nanook of the north and one 
contemporary hit 1977s star wars 
librarian of congress james h billington said the selections 
dont constitute a list of the best american movies but most are 
easily recognizable among moviegoers alltime favorites 
the 25 listed alphabetically 
the best years of our lives 1946 casablanca 1942 
citizen kane 1941 the crowd 1928 dr strangelove or 
how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb 1964 the 
general 1927 gone with the wind 1939 the grapes of 
wrath 1940 high noon 1952 intolerance 1916 the 
learning tree 1969 and the maltese falcon 1941 
also mr smith goes to washington 1939 modern times 
1936 nanook of the north 1922 on the waterfront 1954 
the searchers 1956 singin in the rain 1952 snow white 
and the seven dwarfs 1937 some like it hot 1959 star 
wars 1977 sunrise 1927 sunset boulevard 1950 
vertigo 1958 and the wizard of oz 1939 
billington sought to defuse an almost certain controversy among 
film critics and scholars over the selections 
make no mistake this list of 25 films is not a list of the 
best 25 american films he said film critics and scholars could 
not agree on such a list and the library of congress would not 
embark on any such futile exercise this is not academy awards 
night 
rather he said the list should suggest to the american public 
the breadth of great american filmmaking under guidelines set by 
congress 
no films less than 10 years old were eligible and there was only 
one issued in the past 20 
the registry was created by congress last year as part of the 
national film preservation act which called for naming 25 
outstanding movies to the registry at the library of congress 
annually for three years 
the legislation was prompted partly by the recent boom in 
coloring of black and white films a practice loudly protested by 
moviemakers 
the law does not prevent coloring but any film listed in the 
national film registry must carry a warning label if it has been 
colorized or materially altered in versions produced for video 
cassettes television broadcast or other showings 
three directors whose films were chosen elia kazan billy wilder 
and stanley donen said congress should halt colorization 
they should take the next step to protect those films from all 
kinds of distortion speeding up colorization and all the other 
things that have been done to them and leave them the way we made 
them kazan said that is what they can do to really show how 
they honor our films 
seven of the winning films are owned by broadcasting magnate ted 
turner who is a champion of film colorization 
dave kehr chairman of the national society of film critics and a 
member of the national film preservation board said that the movies 
chosen made up a very safe conservative list but that he wished 
they had been a little more reflective of breadandbutter 
hollywood 
each film added to the governments version of a movie hall of 
fame will bear a seal designating it as an enduring part of our 
national cultural heritage 
the library of congress will obtain a highquality print of the 
original version of the movie for its collection of more than 75000 
film and television titles dating to the 19th century 
billington said half of all movies made before 1950 and 80 
percent of those made before 1930 have been lost forever because of 
the deterioration of early nitrate film into powder and because of 
sloppy cuts and editing of films for videotapes and tv broadcasts 
the cold hard fact is that for all their popularity in america 
today films are an endangered species for the america of 
tomorrow billington said 
the list is the result of a lengthy process involving nominations 
of nearly 1000 movie titles by mail from the general public the 
list was narrowed substantially by the 13 members of the new 
national film preservation board which met in los angeles in july 
billington made the final selection of the 25 top films and 
indicated tuesday that he personally made at least one addition to 
the list which he refused to identify he said there was no 
overwhelming alltime favorite nominated by the public or chosen by 
the panel of experts 
the board included representatives of the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences the american film institute the 
directors guild of america the motion picture association of 
america the national association of broadcasters the national 
society of film critics the screen actors guild of america the 
writers guild of america movie and tv producers and film scholars 
billington said his goals in selecting the outstanding films were 
to help promote movies as an indigenous american art form and 
generate public interest in preserving films

a housing organization on tuesday said the 
problems plaguing the department of housing and urban development 
should not be used as an excuse to dismantle federal programs 
necessary to meet the nations housing needs 
the investigation of mismanagement and abuse at hud is no reason 
to delay maintainance and development of muchneeded housing said 
john simon president of the national housing conference 
the highest priority of the hud secretary and the congress 
should be immediate action to address the critical need for 
additional low and moderateincome housing simon said at a news 
conference the need to investigate should not be an excuse for 
inaction in meeting the nations housing needs 
simon said that with nine months past since the start of the 
current congressional session and the bush administration its 
time to move on the housing crisis is getting much worse 
more than 500000 federally subsidized rental housing units could 
be lost in the next 15 years due to federal inaction or weakened 
national financial conditions he said 
the national housing conference represents more than 1000 public 
and private builders developers planners architects housing 
financiers and tenant groups 
simon said current estimates of the homeless population range 
from 700000 to 4 million but an additional 4 million to 14 million 
american families are doubled up and tripled up in apartments of 
friends and family 
even a mild recession could double homelessness in america 
virtually overnight he said 
simon said current budget requests for housing are inadequate 
with an additional 13 billion to 18 billion needed for federally 
assisted housing programs and 215 billion required to repair 
dilapidated public housing stock another 10 billion should be 
included for new housing construction he said 
simon said he believed housing secretary jack kemp has not 
gotten the support of the administration for funding existing 
housing programs 
instead of using 50 million from the operating subsidies of 
public housing administrations to fight drugs in public housing 
kemp should have been given a separate allocation simon said 
meanwhile one private mortgage insurer announced it would help 
low and moderateincome families purchase almost 10000 homes in 
the next year by insuring 500 million in loans through the a new 
program 
under the community home buyers program prospective homebuyers 
would be allowed to purchase a home with lower down payment and less 
savings on hand and using a higher portion of their income for 
housing expenses than traditional loans require 
the cornerstone of the program developed by ge capital mortgage 
insurance cos is a homebuying and mortgage credit course 
including pre and postloanclosing sessions for borrowers

a federal judge tuesday refused to stop the 
national football league from testing for steroids and declined to 
reinstate 13 players suspended under the program 
us district court judge aubrey robinson said the clear 
congressional policy against judicial interference in labor 
disputes poses a formidable obstacle to the players 
associations request to block the program with a preliminary 
injunction 
the players labor union which says steroid testing is 
unreliable asked the court to suspend the leagues program while it 
is pending before an arbitrator 
robinson said the record in the case simply does not present 
the kind of irreparable harm to the players that would be required 
to issue an injunction 
the nfl suspended 13 players for 30 days after another federal 
judge on aug 28 refused to issue a temporary restraining order 
against the league 
the players association asked robinson to restore the suspended 
players to active status and to order the league to refrain from any 
further suspensions on the basis of steroid testing until the 
arbitrator rules the labor union also sought to enjoin the league 
from further testing for steroids

cardinal jozef glemp the roman catholic 
primate of poland said tuesday the carmelite convent near auschwitz 
may be moved but he complained that jewish protests had touched 
the dignity of the nuns 
glemp said he had not seen a vatican announcement tuesday saying 
the convent should be moved away from the former nazi death camp and 
that the vatican would help pay to build a new prayer center outside 
auschwitz in poland 
but when reporters described the announcement he said it sounded 
like a forceful resolution of the problem and i dont think that 
would be a very positive way he said that by forceful he 
meant an administrative enforcement of the transfer of the 
sisters not their own expressed wish 
glemp who was on a 24hour visit to consecrate a polish church 
in this southwestern city said that building a prayer center away 
from the nazi death camp would be a great step we hope in order 
to solve this problem 
i do think there is a possibility that the nuns could be moved 
elsewhere added glemp but if they were to be moved this should 
be done with charity because that would be also crossing out 
their rights 
glemps remarks were in line with recent hints he has softened 
his position on the convent which many jews regard as an offensive 
intrusion 
at least 25 million jews were among the 4 million people 
murdered by the nazis at the world war ii death camp 
the nuns were supposed to move to a prayer center away from the 
camp by feb 22 under a 1987 agreement between four european 
cardinals and an international jewish delegation 
but the catholic church in poland balked at honoring the accord 
and the deadline passed with no sign of a center or any move to 
relocate the nuns 
the cardinal at the center of the dispute which has split the 
catholic church and revived charges of deeprooted antisemitism in 
poland spent most of a 40minute news conference defending his 
position 
glemp had canceled plans to travel from britain to the united 
states because of threats of jewish protests 
the great jewish protests which developed around the problem of 
the carmelite nuns in auschwitz were very sad because they touched 
the dignity of the women who devote their lives to god said 
glemp he spoke in polish and his remarks were translated into 
english by a fellow priest 
glemp discussed plans for the prayer center last week with 
zygmunt nissenbaum a germanjewish financier who runs a 
philanthropic trust that restores jewish memorials and who has 
offered assistance previously he said the prayer center was just 
wishful thinking 
he did not say when construction might start nor did he say 
explicitly that the nuns would move once the building was complete 
during the news conference glemp called repeatedly for 
catholicjewish dialogue over the convent dispute 
he also acknowledged there was antisemitism in poland but he 
said poles could not accept that auschwitz was a purely jewish 
memorial because many christians also died there 
during the summer glemp suggested repeatedly he wanted the 
convent established in 1984 to remain and called the accord 
offensive 
cardinals in the united states france and belgium have said the 
church should honor the 1987 agreement 
the controversy grew after seven jewish protesters led by a new 
york rabbi tried to climb a fence surrounding the convent and were 
forced back by polish workers in july 
in remarks that increased jewish anger glemp suggested afterward 
that the protesters meant to attack the nuns and said that jews had 
the media easily at your disposal in many countries

the number of east germans seeking 
refuge in west germanys embassies in prague and warsaw swelled to 
more than 600 on tuesday leading bonn to close its warsaw embassy 
to the public 
hungarian news media reported for the first time tuesday that 
czechoslovak authorities were preventing emigres from reaching 
hungary a czechoslovak government official denied the allegation 
the reports followed refugee complaints recently of east german 
and czechoslovak harassment the refugees say authorities are trying 
to keep them from entering hungary from hungary they can cross 
freely to neutral austria under special measures adopted by 
hungarian authorities eight days ago 
refugees inside the west german embassy grounds in prague said 
they now numbered 500 with 300 having climbed over the sixfoot 
fence surrounding the compound the past few days 
an additional 120 east germans also seeking guarantees of safe 
passage to the west are in the embassy in warsaw 
the west german foreign ministry announced tuesday it was closing 
its warsaw embassy to the public until further notice saying the 
situation had become untenable 
franz schoeller bonns ambassador to poland told the west 
german tv network ard that 104 east germans were inside the embassy 
and 16 more were outside he did not spell out what he meant by 
outside the embassy 
bonn officials previously spoke of 110 refugees in the compound 
schoeller said poland has promised a pragmatic solution 
asked if he meant sending the refugees to west germany he replied 
i dont see it that way yet we must wait 
a foreign ministry spokesman jurgen chrobog said the polish 
citizens seeking visas for west germany could obtain them at travel 
agencies 
west germany had already closed to the public its embassies in 
prague and budapest and the diplomatic mission in east berlin after 
hundreds of east germans started seeking refuge in the buildings 
last month 
the budapest embassy reopened to the public after hungary agreed 
to open its borders to the east germans seeking passage to the west 
west german border officials reported 700 refugees arrived in 
west germany over the last 24 hours raising to nearly 17000 the 
number of east germans who have come to west germany since hungary 
opened its borders sept 11 
hungarian radio said the numbers of east germans seeking refuge 
in the prague embassy probably increased because czechoslovak 
authorities are turning east germans back that is preventing them 
from going to hungary although they have valid travel documents 
authorizing them to travel there 
a prague foreign ministry spokesman tuesday denied that 
czechoslovakia honors all international covenants no problems in 
rail or car transportation are made for east germans traveling to 
hungary with valid documents ivan kulhanek said all statements 
implying the opposite are untrue 
czechoslovakia sandwiched between east germany and hungary is 
the most direct route for east germans traveling to hungary 
wolfgang wagner an official of a west german charity 
organization handling east german refugees in hungary said 100 east 
germans who had crossed the border illegally from czechoslovakia 
arrived at his camp tuesday 
before hungary opened its borders thousands had crossed 
illegally over stretches of the countrys western border that have 
been cleared of barbed wire as part of hungarys more liberal 
political and economic policies 
the state news agency mti reported tuesday that criminal 
proceedings had been started against nine border guards charged with 
smuggling east germans across the austrian border 
it quoted the military prosecutors office in the west hungarian 
town of gyoer as saying the guards had in exchange for 
significant sums helped east germans clear the border during a 
period following aug 20 1989 before hungary allowed east germans 
to legally cross into austria 
five men have been taken into custody and the other four have 
been taken off border patrol duty cannot carry out armed service 
and are not allowed to leave the military compound until the issue 
is clarified mti said 
east germanys official communist party newspaper stepped up its 
harsh criticism of west germany tuesday accusing it of slave 
trade in allegedly encouraging the exodus of east germans to the 
west

the justice departments criminal division is 
seeking transcripts of a house subcommittees hearings on 
allegations of influence peddling at the department of housing and 
urban development a spokesman said tuesday 
however the ranking republican on the house panel rep 
christopher shays said he was unsatisfied with the move and he 
continued to say he may call for a special prosecutor in the case 
justice spokesman david runkel said the criminal division had 
asked for the transcripts of hearings being conducted by the house 
government operations subcommittee 
earlier this year prosecutors in the departments public 
integrity section made a preliminary conclusion that the hud 
inspector generals report on influence peddling in the section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program a main focus of the congressional 
investigation showed no instances of criminal wrongdoing 
the subcommittee has heard testimony that politically connected 
developers received approval from highlevel hud officials in the 
award of government housing grants 
so far the department has been reviewing newspaper accounts of 
the hearings at which a series of witnesses have described lobbying 
of high hud officials on behalf of development firms runkel said 
the subcommittee has also heard conflicting testimony about the 
role of former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr in the awarding of 
grants 
pierce has been called back for more questioning about whether 
despite his repeated denials he helped political friends get hud 
grants 
the subcommittee is expected to vote wednesday to subpoena 
pierce who last week abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance the 
former secretarys lawyers said they needed more time to prepare for 
the questioning 
the panels chairman rep tom lantos dcalif has expressed 
the view that other witnesses had put the lie to pierces 
denials that he ever helped prominent republicans get hud backing 
for housing projects 
lantos has said he wants to give pierce an opportunity to clarify 
testimony that has been contradicted by other witnesses 
earlier tuesday runkel rejected a call by rep bruce morrison 
dconn for a special prosecutor in the matter 
investigations are proceeding in us attorneys offices around 
the country and there is no reason to believe these cannot be 
handled by the us attorneys runkel said 
attorney general dick thornburgh has made it clear he wants 
these cases given high priority the spokesman added referring to 
investigations of fraud of hud programs 
as for runkels statement of the request for hearing transcripts 
shays rconn said thats not comforting this should have been 
done a long time ago it just raises questions in my mind about the 
veracity of the justice departments investigation 
he said that because of allegations concerning dealings with hud 
around the country it is important that any criminal investigation 
be centralized in washington and not be conducted by us attorneys 
around the nation 
he said unless there is a centralized investigation that looks at 
the principal former hud officials involved including pierce 
then i just totally feel weve got to take it away from justice 
and have a special prosecutor right now i just dont know the 
justice department hasnt had much communication with committee 
members 
i can assure you that the records of the house subcommittee are 
being reviewed closely as a part of the hud matter runkel said at 
a morning briefing 
later in the day however runkel acknowledged that the 
department had not yet received any subcommittee records but would 
be asking formally for the transcripts of the hearings 
that letter is going up today or tomorrow runkel said

the ceremony lasted only a few minutes 
tuesday but for soviet immigrant andrei frolov the journey to us 
citizenship took years 
eight years ago frolov staged a hunger strike for 26 days in his 
homeland to attract the attention of soviet authorities who ignored 
his plea to join his american wife in the united states his wife 
did the same 
after a year of bureaucratic haggling frolovs name was added to 
the list of soviet citizens with a spouse in the west who was 
allowed to leave in 1982 
years later frolov dressed in a threepiece gray suit stood 
outside a san francisco courtroom ready to fulfill his dream of 
citizenship 
its a great day frolov said while waiting for the ceremony 
frolov has been working as a translator for a russianlanguage 
newspaper in san francisco since march when he left his position at 
the department of defense language institute in monterey 
he is also translating his play about life in the soviet union 
strangers dont enter into english and hopes one day to have 
it produced 
i expected life would be hard here because i did not know 
english well and i couldnt use my education here its getting 
better he said 
a shy softspoken man frolov worked as a taxi driver furniture 
mover and bookstore clerk before he began teaching russian to 
soldiers at the institute in monterey 
monterey is a pretty small town and there is a small community 
of russian instructors he said sometimes it looks like the 
soviet union but it is better to be among americans 
frolov 58 joined 150 others for the naturalization ceremony 
tuesday he stood stiffly with a stern look on his face afterward 
he pulled a voter registration form out of his pocket and proudly 
proclaimed his intention to register probably as a democrat 
asked how he felt he said simply great 
frolovs journey began with a fascination with the united states 
a journalist in the soviet union he read american literature and 
watched movies in moscow theaters friends teased him calling him 
an americaniste 
then he met lois becker an american student working on a 
dissertation at moscows lenin library 
nine months later they married when beckers visa expired she 
was forced to leave the soviet union without her husband when she 
was unable to find work 
it was the beginning of the couples yearlong struggle against 
what became a bureaucratic nightmare then for reasons that remain 
unknown soviet authorities allowed frolov to leave and he and 
becker were reunited 
the transition was not easy they separated in 1985 and later 
divorced 
frolov worked at a string of subsistencelevel jobs after he 
arrived in the united states he recalls the early days in america 
when a trip to the supermarket could overwhelm him 
living alone in a rundown house in washington dc frolov would 
rise early to practice english watch television to further improve 
his conversational skills and then set off for work in a bookstore 
he studied at the university of the district of columbia three 
nights a week and would walk the streets at any hour to satisfy his 
wanderlust 
although his life in america has been filled with challenges 
frolov said he has no regrets about leaving the soviet union i 
still feel some kind of pain i dont want even to visit moscow

the national aids commission concerned that 
president bushs antidrug strategy makes too little mention of 
aids on tuesday agreed to draft a statement calling for treatment 
of drug addicts in preventing spread of aids 
the statement will reaffirm the previous aids commissions call 
for drug treatment on demand as a national goal said june osborn 
chairwoman of the new panel 
osborn said the statement will be carefully worded so it does 
not appear antagonistic but she added that the panel can be 
aggressive without being adversarial 
we want to say something thats a firm reminder in a collegial 
sort of way said osborn dean of the university of michigans 
school of public health after she adjourned a twoday meeting of 
the panel 
the previous aids commission formed by president reagan and 
chaired by admiral james watkins now secretary of energy 
highlighted the need for expanded drug treatment capacity to stop 
spread of aids through sharing of needles by drug users 
the new aids panel created by congress last year but not fully 
constituted until this summer will not recommend a specific amount 
of funds for drug treatment but its statement will show that 
commissioners share the priority judgment of the watkins 
commission osborn said 
commissioner don des jarlais a new york state coordinator for 
aids research estimated that the bush plan would deliver about a 
third of what the watkins commission said would be needed to treat 
all drug addicts 
the commission anticipating maneuvering in the house and senate 
for mandatory aids testing and tracing of sexual partners also 
agreed to a resolution calling on congress to block attempts to add 
aidspolicy amendments to appropriations bills 
this method of attaching riders to appropriations bills is 
often used to win approval of measures that could not be approved in 
the normal legislative process 
osborn said that based on past patterns of behavior and 
rumors commissioners expect that the parliamentary tactic will be 
attempted again this year as congress completes action on spending 
bills for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
we would like to be sure that aids policy is taken very 
seriously she said

a judge tuesday delayed the use of videotaped 
testimony from former secretary of state henry kissinger in the 
libel trial of journalist seymour hersh who is accused of defaming 
a former indian prime minister 
moraji desai who was indian prime minister from 1977 to 1979 
filed a civil libel lawsuit against hersh claiming he was libeled 
in hershs 1983 book the price of power about kissinger 
hersh wrote that desai served as a paid cia informant 
us district court judge charles norgle called an early recess 
tuesday after hershs lawyers said they would object to desais 
attorneys showing the jury a onehour taped deposition by kissinger 
lawyers were to present arguments on the admissibility of 
kissingers taped testimony on wednesday 
kissinger is scheduled to deliver a speech in chicago on 
wednesday and might be subpoenaed to testify if the judge bars the 
use of the taped testimony said john omeara one of desais 
attorneys 
desais lawsuit was filed in chicago in accordance with the 
tradition of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the 
defendant hersh was born in chicago but now lives in washington 
dc 
omeara said kissingers testimony could be instrumental to the 
case 
it says that to the best of his knowledge desai couldnt be 
the spy omeara said after tuesdays court session 
hershs lawyers have indicated that they consider kissingers 
testimony to be invalid and based on hearsay 
earlier in the day desais lawyers finished showing excerpts 
from 81 hours of videotaped depositions made by desai during visits 
to chicago in 198485 
desai 94 was too ill to travel from india to chicago to testify 
in the trial said his lawyer cyriac kappil 
in his deposition desai said he met with president johnson at 
least twice in 1968 and with kissinger once in 1969 in india but 
said he could not recall what they spoke about 
in excerpts shown monday desai said he had met with top us 
officials but insisted that he did not reveal any secret 
information 
bernard nussbaum an attorney for hersh said monday that the 
author had six independent sources who claimed desai a bitter enemy 
of former prime minister indira gandhi received 20000 a year as a 
cia informant 
nussbaum said the indian politician cooperated with the cia 
because he was opposed to ms gandhis close relations with the 
soviet union and her preparations for the 1971 war with pakistan 
under us libel law desais attorneys must convince jurors that 
hersh knowingly printed false negligent or malicious material 
hersh won the pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1970 
for his articles exposing the my lai massacre in vietnam when he was 
a reporter for the dispatch news service he was also a reporter for 
the associated press and for the new york times he left the 
newspaper to pursue his own writing projects

were killed in an april explosion aboard the uss iowa 
navy spokesman cmdr mark baker said the new jersey fired its 
weapons successfully off the california coast 
the ships nine guns in three turrets each fired three times 
resulting in 27 successful rounds

gunners mate clayton hartwig captain of the middle gun as the

turrets on aug 4 while deployed in the mediterranean

a hijacker forced a moroccan 
twinengine plane to fly from the western sahara to grand canary 
island on tuesday then gave up after holding eight people hostage 
for hours a spanish official said 
the official eligio hernandez told a news conference the arms 
brandished by mohamed abdallah bin namou were fake a toy pistol 
and a phony grenade 
he identified bin namou 37 as a city employee from el aaiun in 
the disputed moroccan territory of western sahara and said police 
were holding bin namou pending charges 
hernandez said the man forced the crew of the royal air maroc 
atr42 turboprop to fly to the canaries after it left smara in the 
western sahara on a regularly scheduled flight to el aaiun 
bin namou let the six passengers leave unharmed two hours after 
the plane made an emergency landing at gando airport and gave 
himself up to police unconditionally two hours and 35 minutes after 
that hernandez said 
he said the two crew members were freed unharmed when bin namou 
surrendered 
earlier a police officer at the airport said the plane carried 
four crew 
moroccan king hassan ii is to make his first official visit to 
spain on sunday and both hernandez and spanish foreign minister 
francisco fernandez ordonez confirmed that bin namou had demanded 
that a letter concerning the visit be made public 
hernandez said the letter seemed motivated more by religious than 
political beliefs but gave no details 
in rabat the moroccan capital the airline referred to hijacker 
as mentally unstable 
grand canary island 135 miles west of the western sahara in the 
atlantic is part of the sevenisland chain that is one of spains 
17 autonomous regions 
spain abandoned its colony in the western sahara in 1975 and 
hassan sent thousands of civilians to occupy the area the polisario 
national liberation front also claims the western sahara and has 
waged a desert guerrilla war against the moroccan army since 1975 
morocco and the polisario have accepted in principle a 
unsupervised referendum to determine the fate of the 
102700squaremile territory inhabited by about 73000 mainly 
nomadic western saharans

the library of congress list of 25 films 
deemed culturally historically or esthetically significant drew 
generally favorable reviews tuesday from james stewart billy wilder 
and other film industry figures 
im delighted said wilder whose some like it hot and 
sunset boulevard are listed i wish things would go forward to 
reconstruct those films as they were not colorized and not 
butchered by cuts 
the first thing that crossed my mind said stewart who 
starred in the frank capra film mr smith goes to washington 
also on the list is that im glad that frank is still with us and 
can enjoy his vindication 
i think its a terrific list id like to see all of them 
commented george kirgo president of the writers guild of america 
the only omission i see is the apartment but billy wilder is 
pretty well represented 
im so happy these 25 films have been selected said arthur 
hiller president of the directors guild of america id be even 
happier if more films could have been selected as the 
congressional bill intended id be happiest if there were no need 
for a bill and the moral rights of all artists not to have their 
works altered or defaced would be protected 
the major surprise among the selections for the new national film 
registry was the 1969 the learning tree a semiautobiographical 
film of a black boys rural childhood by gordon parks famed life 
magazine photographer 
im surprised pleasantly so said parks at his new york 
residence im very happy the film was very well received in its 
release and its still playing in europe and on television here 
the national film registry is the outgrowth of protests by 
filmmakers over the colorization and the editing for television of 
classic films congress last year passed the national film 
preservation act which called for the naming of 25 classic films 
annually for three years 
im delighted to be one of the 25 but im horrified at the 
necessity of the act said stanley donen the director of the 
musical singin in the rain 
donen said that the act will do nothing to keep broadcasters from 
editing movies for length or duplicating them with poor quality 
control onto videocassettes 
the aim said librarian of congress james h bilington in 
announcing the first 25 tuesday was to help promote movies as an 
american art form and generate public interest in preserving films 
i think its as good a list as we can expect the first time 
out said dave kehr a member of the national film preservation 
board and chairman of the national society of film critics its a 
very safe conservative list i wish the list had been a little 
more reflective of bread and butter hollywood 
said film critic leonard maltin i feel that theyve chosen 
such generally outstanding titles that whatever omissions one could 
argue this year will be rectified next year if not the year after 
a board of 13 film figures made the final selection drawing from 
a thousand nominations from the public 
jimmy stewart made his comments in washington dc between a 
bookstore signing for his new volume of poetry and a visit to the 
senate to campaign for more protection for films he recalled the 
premiere of mr smith goes to washington at constitution hall in 
1939 the invited senators became restive at the films depiction of 
political corruption 
the film broke during the screening stewart recalled and by the 
time capra returned to his seat after climbing to the projection 
booth to repair it half his audience was gone the press was 
completely against the picture too 
the main thing is that frank is still here to enjoy his 
vindication said the actor capra has been in failing health at 
his home in la quinta calif 
wilder was his usual acerbic self in calling for greater 
protection for films the television people call in a butcher who 
has failed at the ralphs grocery store to supervise the cutting of 
pictures so they can slip in the noxema commercials frankly nobody 
gives a 
the list of 25 offers some surprises especially the learning 
tree as well as glaring omissions 
dw griffiths mishmash of history intolerance was 
selected but not his great classic the birth of a nation 
perhaps because of its sympathetic portrayal of the ku klux klan 
king vidors the crowd was included but not his more 
impressive achievement the big parade john ford westerns are 
represented by the searchers and not his landmark stagecoach 
other debatable choices robert flahertys 1922 documentary 
nanook of the north stanley kubricks 1964 dr strangelove 
f w murnaus 1927 sunrise among the missing the treasure 
of the sierra madre its a wonderful life it happened one 
night all about eve shane top hat the african 
queen rebecca from here to eternity 
besides wilder double selections were victor fleming who 
directed both gone with the wind and the wizard of oz in 
1939 and ford the grapes of wrath and the searchers

consumer prices did not rise at all last month 
as big declines in the cost of gasoline and womens clothing 
combined to provide the best news on inflation since early 1986 the 
government said tuesday 
the august performance of the labor departments consumer price 
index followed modest increases of 02 percent in both june and july 
and left analysts marveling at the betterthanexpected showing on 
inflation 
the august inflation result was outstanding from the point of 
view of the consumer said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co the breadandbutter categories of food housing 
transportation and clothing showed either big declines or very small 
increases 
the modest price increases starting in june represented a sharp 
contrast from the first part of the year when surges in energy and 
food costs pushed inflation up to a disturbing annual rate of 67 
percent 
with the string of good reports consumer prices are now rising 
at an annual rate of 48 percent up only slightly from the 44 
percent increases registered in both 1987 and 1988 
the inflation rate fell by 03 percent in april 1986 
in another economic report tuesday the government said that 
construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 5 percent in 
august falling to an annual rate of 135 million units 
economists blamed increases in mortgage rates during august for 
the setback they said that the improved outlook for inflation 
should help push mortgage rates down in coming months and should 
keep the housing market from going into a tailspin 
builders saw rates rising and got a case of the jitters but we 
think that interest rates will start moving down again in the months 
ahead as various indicators suggest that the inflation threat is 
subsiding very quickly said richard peach senior economist at 
the mortgage bankers association 
the bush administration is predicting a 5 percent inflation rate 
for this year a view supported by many private economists who 
believe that recent increases in crude oil prices will translate 
into slighlty higher monthly inflation numbers for the remainder of 
the year 
we think that inflation is probably going to move up a little 
bit but we are not looking for anything like the surge we had at 
the beginning of 1989 said david berson chief economist of the 
federal national mortgage corp 
donald ratajczak director of the economic forecasting project at 
georgia state university said that the underlying inflation rate is 
running between 4 percent and 45 percent where it has been for 
much of this decade 
for august the main moderating force on prices was a steep 42 
percent plunge in gasoline prices it was the biggest onemonth 
decrease in pump prices in three years and followed smaller declines 
of 1 percent in june and 22 percent in july gasoline prices had 
shot up 212 percent in the first five months of the year 
also holding down prices was a 15 percent drop in clothing 
prices in august led by a big drop in womens clothing costs the 
decline was credited to larger than normal endofseason price cuts 
and the effect of the stronger dollar which makes imported goods 
less expensive 
food costs which shot up at an annual rate of 93 percent at the 
beginning of the year because of the lingering effects of the 1988 
drought were well behaved in august posting a small 02 percent 
rise 
declines in the cost of pork poultry fruits and vegetables 
helped offset higher prices for beef fish and eggs 
overall transportation costs fell 15 percent in august 
reflecting not only the drop in gasoline prices but also declines in 
the cost of new and used cars 
one of the few categories failing to show price moderation during 
the month was the cost of medical care which climbed by 07 percent 
for the fourth month in a row 
the price of all goods and services excluding food and energy 
rose just 02 percent last month a modest increase which gave 
analysts encouragement that the underlying inflation rate is 
returning to a more moderate pace as well 
analysts said despite the good inflation news they were not 
looking for any immediate move on the part of the federal reserve to 
lower interest rates they said that despite the moderating 
inflationary pressures the fed was under no pressure to cut 
interest rates because the overall economy is moving ahead at a 
healthy clip 
the various changes left the overall consumer price index at 
1246 in august meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods 
costing 100 in the base period of 198284 would have cost 12460 
last month

ptl founder jim bakker assured his 
followers he would not lie to you about anything in excerpts of 
his television shows viewed tuesday by jurors at his fraud trial 
the jury is being shown eight hours culled from broadcasts of 
bakkers ptl show much of it dealing with lifetime 
partnerships followers were asked to buy 1000 partnerships 
guaranteeing three nights lodging a year for life at ptls heritage 
usa theme park in fort mill sc 
im sincere i would not lie to you about anything bakker 
told viewers in one excerpt mr irs got to me first uncle sam 
just took everything we could scrape together next month will be a 
little better for me 
in a 1984 videotape bakker urged his audience to pay for 
partnerships with a credit card saying he bought his with a credit 
card because he didnt have any cash that same year prosecutors 
said bakker received 1 million in salary and bonuses and bought a 
palm desert calif home and a rollsroyce 
bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million in ptl 
money raised from lifetime partnership sales to pay for personal 
luxuries if found guilty of the 24 counts against him bakker could 
be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than 5 million 
the jury saw about six hours of the videotapes on tuesday and 
were expected to begin viewing more of the tapes on wednesday after 
which the prosecution is expected to rest its case 
in a december 1984 videotape bakker was shown saying if i ever 
see anyone at this place robbing or stealing they are going to 
jail to which someone in the courtroom audience shouted amen 
in another broadcast bakker complained that more than 900 people 
had used invalid credit cards or bad checks to buy partnerships 
bakker reopened partnership sales in the heritage grand hotel at 
heritage usa 
some peoples credit cards did not go through and some peoples 
checks went through and through and through again they bounced from 
here to california bakker said 
ptl also sold partnerships for another hotel at heritage usa 
towers hotel sales were reopened in 1986 even though investigators 
say more than 30000 partnerships in the towers hotel already had 
been sold bakker told viewers he had 8 million in unpaid bills on 
the towers 
im going to give something thats the best bargain in the 
world bakker said on a show recorded may 31 1986 when youre 
desperate you do desperate things 
witnesses called earlier in the trial have testified they bought 
the partnerships but could not get rooms others have testified that 
partnerships were oversold and that the money from such promotions 
often was used to cover ptls daytoday operating costs rather than 
finance construction of the guaranteed rooms and buildings 
fbi agent john pearson who produced the tape said more than 
66000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time bakker left ptl 
in march 1987 despite a publicized limit of 25000

many aids patients die as a direct result of 
simply wasting away because their bodies are unable to retain enough 
food for adequate nourishment according to a study released tuesday 
by a columbia university researcher 
improving nutritional status provides a reasonable 
expectation for prolonging life and maintaining the quality of 
life for aids patients reports dr donald p kotler an associate 
professor at the columbias college of physicians and surgeons and 
the st lukesroosevelt hospital in new york 
in a study published in the american journal of clinical 
nutrition kotler estimated that 70 percent to 80 percent of aids 
patients die as a result of wasting away 
in studying the process kotler uses a measurement called body 
cell mass the weight of muscle and organs excluding fat bone and 
water outside the cells 
in a study 32 aids patients patients died when the bodycell 
mass dropped to an average of 54 percent of the ideal the study 
started 100 days before death when the average bodycell mass was 71 
percent of the ideal 
bodycell mass gives a more accurate picture of the state of 
malnutrition because patients can lose bodycell mass while not 
losing weight dramatically kotler said 
in a comments at a meeting tuesday of the federation of american 
societies of experimental biology kotler said the study did not 
determine the precise mechanism that causes death due to 
malnutrition among aids patients 
we do not know whether death is due to a general cellular 
starvation so that a critical number of cells stop functioning or 
some critical organ such as the brain liver kidneys or heart 
stops functioning he said 
dr c wayne callaway of george washington university told the 
meeting that kotlers study suggests that a control of malnutrition 
among aids patients might prolong life 
while we will have to wait on studies to prove that adequate 
nutrition can prolong life in aids patients from a doctors point 
of view i consider it only responsible to treat patients with the 
information that we have said callaway 
callaway said vomiting and diarrhea are the most common causes of 
malnutrition among aids patients and these symptoms often can be 
treated with drugs or food selection that will improve nutrition 
while nutrition does not solve the primary problem the aids 
viral infection it can improve the quality of patients lives he 
said many problems that cause malnutirition in aids patients are 
treatable by fairly simple interventions 
in another report at the meeting scientists from johns hopkins 
university in baltimore reported that they cleared all detectable 
signs of aids from a patient through a combination of radiation and 
chemotherapy to kill the patients bone marrow cells azt to prevent 
the aids virus from invading new cells and a bone marrow transplant 
the patient a 41yearold man died 46 days after the treatment 
from a type of cancer but no trace of aids genetic material could 
be detected in tissue samples from the patient 
even though the patient died we believe we demonstrated that 
he was cleared of all signs of the aids virus said dr rein 
saral a johns hopkins associate professor 
he cautioned the results should not be interpreted as a cure 
for aids because the virus could still have been present in some 
cells of the patients body

ethiopia and the eritrean peoples liberation 
front on tuesday concluded nearly two weeks of negotiations still 
disputing who would chair talks to end their 28yearold war but 
expecting to resolve that and other remaining issues during a 
meeting in november 
the two sides will meet again nov 18 in nairobi kenya to 
complete the preliminary talks that began sept 7 at the carter 
center 
former president jimmy carter an observer to the atlanta talks 
said he hoped ethiopia and the eplf would iron out their differences 
on preliminary issues and ratify a plan for substantative peace 
talks at the nairobi meeting 
according to a joint communique issued tuesday by the ethiopian 
and eplf delegations the two sides agreed to 13 items during the 
atlanta talks which were held to develop a framework for peace 
talks both sides also indicated a desire for carter to play a 
continuing role in peacemaking efforts 
but differences remained over the chairmanship observers and 
staff for the future talks 
carter ethiopian delegation leader ashegre yigletu and eritrean 
delegation head alamin mohamed saiyed said much progress had been 
made during the atlanta talks but cautioned that an end to the war 
is not imminent 
atlanta has been an arena within which they could build up 
mutual trust carter said obviously differences on major 
issues are still there 
for 28 years they have not been able to make this much 
progress and many hundreds of thousands of people have perished 
he said 
the items agreed to during the atlanta talks were mostly 
procedural though the two sides did agree that the sites for the 
peace talks will be rotated between nairobi khartoum sanaa 
cairo ashura and harare a date has not been set for the peace 
talks 
the duties and functions of the chairman or cochairmen were 
agreed upon the eritreans however want carter to serve as 
chairman with a cochairman selected from among the heads of state 
of the venue countries 
ethiopia wants two equal and permanent cochairmen with one 
being an african leader 
the two sides disagreed over whether observers may only be 
representatives of nations or if they may represent international 
organizations 
earlier in the talks the possibility was raised over whether a 
ceasefire could be effected during the interim between the 
preliminary discussions and the peace talks both sides tuesday 
declined to commit to such action before the peace talks 
combat and famine have combined to kill an estimated 1 million 
people since ethiopia and eritrea went to war in 1961 ethiopia 
considers the war a battle of secession while the eritreans view 
the war as a battle for independence 
eritrea a northern province was joined with ethiopia in a 
federation the eritreans opposed eritrea provides ethiopias only 
direct access to the red sea 
after several attempts to arrange peace talks over the years 
failed the two sides earlier this year agreed for carter to serve 
as a neutral observer for preliminary discussions aimed at setting 
an agenda for peace talks 
the talks were suspended over the weekend while carter traveled 
to nicaragua for a previously scheduled factfinding mission before 
that countrys national elections carter plans to act as an 
observer to the february voting

an amendment that would require the 
administration to seek an international ban on high seas drift net 
fishing was approved by a house subcommittee tuesday 
state department officials said last week that while they thought 
such a ban would eventually be discussed in an international forum 
the united states needed more data on the effects of drift net 
fishing before pushing for one 
there are those who say it is premature but it would be 
irresponsible to sit on our hands said rep jolene unsoeld 
dwash who sponsored the drift net amendment we already know 
our salmon are being stolen 
the data will be gathered under provisions of recently negotiated 
agreements with japan korea and taiwan the three nations with 
drift net fleets operating in the nouth pacific 
the amendment was attached to bill reauthorizing the socalled 
magnuson fishery conservation and managment act of 1976 which 
created the 200mile us fishing zone and eight regional fisheries 
councils to manage the ocean resources 
the reauthorization bill adopted by the committees fisheries and 
wildlife conservation subcommittee requires the secretary of state 
to seek as soon as possible an international drift net ban and 
to report back to congress in 18 months on the progress of 
negotiations including a list of nations that have refused to talk 
us fishermen claim the drift net fleets under the guise of 
fishing for squid are actually harvesting salmon in quantities that 
have already caused a drop in alaska washington state and oregon 
fish runs 
environmental groups have also claimed the nets are responsible 
for the deaths of thousands of marine mammals sea birds and other 
marine animals annually 
subcommittee chairman gerry studds dmass said no other 
fishing method is as destructive or indiscriminate as drift nets 
and the legislation would set a national goal of banning drift 
net fishing on the high seas

a former nursing home aide charged 
with smothering five patients testified tuesday that the alleged 
murder plot was nothing more than a fictitious game that got out of 
hand 
the defense rested after the testimony of gwendolyn graham who 
is charged with five counts of firstdegree murder and one count of 
conspiracy to murder on allegations she suffocated incapacitated 
patients at alpine manor nursing home in walker between january and 
april 1987 
defense and prosecution attorneys later finished their closing 
arguments and the case went to the jury which began deliberationa 
before adjourning for the night if convicted graham faces life in 
prison without parole 
graham 26 denied killing any patients or knowing of any murders 
at the home 
she testified that her former lesbian lover nurses aide 
catherine wood often concocted stories and spread rumors and that 
she usually went along to humor her the alleged murder plot was one 
of those head games graham said at first it was a joke 
but when graham began seeing another woman she said wood 
threatened to make someone believe the story that we had been 
killing patients 
wood 27 has pleaded guilty to one count of seconddegree murder 
and one count of conspiracy to murder in exchange for her testimony 
against graham two counts of firstdegree murder were dropped wood 
will be sentenced later 
when police began investigating the deaths after graham moved 
back to her hometown of tyler texas with the other woman she said 
she realized that wood was going to get even just like she said 
she was 
grahams testimony disputed that of several of her friends and 
former lovers who testified that graham on separate occasions had 
admitted suffocating patients at the home 
graham said she did not admit killing patients but related the 
story as one wood had made up graham said she only once claimed to 
have suffocated patients in an effort to scare another woman she 
said 
graham said she decided to leave wood for another lover because 
i was tired of playing games hurting people the games just 
got out of hand 
graham testified that wood dominated their relationship often 
starting fights between graham and other women and once threatening 
graham with a gun the testimony contrasted woods account of the 
affair 
during closing arguments the prosecutor told the jury that the 
case was not a referendum on homosexuality 
wood testified that graham said the killings relieved tension

the nuclear regulatory commission sees no need 
to stop long island lighting co from getting ready to decommission 
the new shoreham nuclear power plant in new york the commission 
said in a letter released tuesday 
energy secretary james d watkins has vowed to try to keep the 
plant intact and had asked the commission to stop the company from 
dsiabling the reactor before the commission could rule on the 
transfer of its operating license to local and state authorities for 
decommissioning 
although lilco has indicated its intent not to operate shoreham 
and the agreement between lilco and the state of new york indicates 
an intent to decommission the facility thus far the activities that 
lilco is carrying out are authorized under the existing license 
kenneth m carr the commission chairman said in a sept 15 letter 
to watkins 
watkins has also called for a full environmental review of the 
shutdown plan in an effort to compel new york to keep the plant in 
mothballs 
carr assured watkins that the plant would not be allowed to 
deteriorate while the commission considers whether to transfer its 
license to the long island power authority that authority plans to 
hire the new york power authority to do the actual decommissioning 
work 
the company has removed fuel from the reactor and cut staff 
spurring complaints from watkins carr wrote we do not believe 
that reduction in staff at the facility warrants enforcement or 
sanction 
the fully licensed plant about 50 miles east of new york city 
has never operated commercially gov mario cuomo negotiated a plan 
to buy the plant for 1 in order to tear it down maintaining that 
the area could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident 
in return lilco will get a decade of approximately 5 percent annual 
rate increases

forecasters consulted computers satellites and 
yellowing hurricane charts tuesday in a frantic effort to plot the 
course of hurricane hugo which might hit the united states this 
weekend 
then again it might not 
when you look out two to three days in the future thats when 
we have our most difficult problems said bob sheets director of 
the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables we have a 
lot of different things going on 
forecasters said us residents from the florida keys to north 
carolina should watch hugos uncertain path carefully the 
hurricane leaving devastation behind in the caribbean was moving 
past the bahamas and could affect florida by friday forecasters 
said 
they added however that it could also miss the united states 
entirely 
a variety of weather factors some as far away as canada and the 
rocky mountains could determine hugos course but the most likely 
effect will come from the combination of a lowpressure system 
moving west across southern georgia and a broad highpressure ridge 
the bermuda high to hugos north 
the highpressure system probably will block hugo from spinning 
harmlessly out into the atlantic as hurricane gabrielle did last 
week forecasters said while the lowpressure system could lure 
hugo westward 
forecasters said the varying factors also would affect the 
storms strength which was slowly rebuilding tuesday after falling 
from 140 mph winds to 105 mph 
forecasters watched data spit out of advanced computers studied 
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on air force 
hurricane hunter planes and even pulled out old hurricane 
charts to see what storms similar to hugo have done 
we were just looking through a bunch of the old charts 
sheets said theyve done everything theyve done loopityloops 
theyve gone into south florida theyve gone into central florida 
all the way up to the carolinas 
an air force reconnaissance crew that flew into hugo tuesday said 
the eye was about 30 to 40 miles across and the pressure had risen 
to about 965 millibars a sign of weakening 
its weaker than in the past few days but its still a 
significant hurricane said air force capt dave carlisle 
hurricane david a destructive hurricane that hit eastern 
caribbean islands 10 years ago swept past puerto rico hit the 
island of hispaniola moved through the western bahamas then made 
landfall on floridas middle east coast 
so far hugo has moved from the eastern caribbean across puerto 
rico then away from hispaniola and was headed slightly east of the 
bahamas 
computer models that use all available weather data past records 
and physics equations were laying out conflicting futures for hugo 
sheets said 
the best advice forecasters could offer sheets said was for 
coastal residents across the southeastern united states to be ready

the air force said tuesday failure to remove 
an improperly manufactured vent plug during refueling of a b52 
bomber led to a fuel spill and explosion in july that killed one 
person and injured 11 
the vent plug used during pressure checks was mistakenly left 
in place causing overpressurization and a spill said maj gen 
richard d smith commander of the san antonio air logistics command 
at kelly air force base 
in the most laymans terms we filled up a balloon and there 
was no place for the air to go and it ruptured smith said at a 
news conference 
jesus pedraza a worker was killed and three of 11 injured 
people were hospitalized after the july 24 nighttime accident 
the lengthy accident investigation report on the fire did not 
determine a cause of the blaze which charred the b52 one of 
several aircraft serviced at kelly and did total damage estimated 
at 158 million according to the report 
smith said a differently designed vent plug was used at kelly 
before the accident although there was technical data within the 
air force indicating the design was faulty that was not determined 
until after the explosion he said 
a new design is now used on vent plugs at kelly smith said

prodded the democraticcontrolled congress on tuesday to move more 
quickly on his cleanair proposals 
bush challenged democratic leaders to finish work on his proposed 
overhaul of the clean air act of 1974 this year a target foley 
the nations topranking elected democrat had called possible but 
unlikely 
suggesting his legislation had been languishing in house and 
senate committees bush declared every day that passes is another 
day were postponing progress on clean air 
to a crowd of several thousand sprawled on the banks of the 
spokane river under bright skies in foleys hometown bush said 
we need action on the legislation weve proposed now 
weve brought people together and put a sound proposal on the 
table now its up to congress to pass this cleanair legislation 
this year 
bushs proposals call for tougher standards on acid rain urban 
smog and industrial emissions 
in washington the presidents backers won an important victory 
in the envrionment subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee a 1210 vote turned rejected an amendment to the 
presidents clean air package backed by environmental groups that 
bush supporters argued would be too tough on cities and small 
businesses 
the democratic chairman of the parent committee rep john 
dingell of michigan is backing the presidents plan 
meanwhile the president issued in a statement expressing 
concern and sympathy for victims of hurricane hugo spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said all necessary federal resources will be 
quickly mobilized to help the people of the virgin islands and 
puerto rico recover from this disaster 
in advance of bushs speech foley said that the house planned to 
move forward on bushs cleanair legislation but that action this 
year was possible but unlikely 
if i were prudent i would say early next year foley told 
reporters monday also predicting that the house would modify the 
proposal 
bush accompanied by environmental protection administration 
chief william reilly made the excursion into foleys congressional 
district for a ceremony marking washingtons 100th anniversary as a 
state it was the final stop on a twoday swing that included 
similar centennial observations in south dakota and montana 
foley who told the crowd bushs visit was a proud moment for 
the state of washington sat impassively through the presidents 
remarks directed at congress but the speaker clapped politely when 
bushs call for action this year prompted a wave of applause from 
the crowd 
despite needling the democratic leadership bush praised foley in 
the speech as a man of integrity decency fair play ok hes a 
democrat but hes a man i am very proud to be able to work with 
flying back to washington aboard air force one foley told 
reporters i dont think the president really expects that every 
time he should send a proposal to the congress we would just 
automatically say well this is better than anyone could possible 
improve on therefore well enact it without any question or without 
any additions 
asked about bushs complaint monday that the democrats response 
to his drug strategy and other initiatives is always to spend more 
and raise taxes foley replied 
well with the greatest respect since im flying in his 
airplane i dont agree with the suggestion that we are trying to 
tax more or to spend more 
foley also said he thinks bush will eventually lose the fight 
over reducing the capital gains tax despite the presidents initial 
victory in the house ways and means committee 
were going to do our best on the floor of the house and the 
senate to defeat the proposal which i think is unwise and 
illtimed unfair this is one in which the president and we 
have a very clear disagreement and well have an alternative 
proposal to consider when it reaches the house floor 
bush who has planted a tree and stressed environmental themes at 
each stop called for a new environmental awareness on the part of 
all americans 
saying pollution isnt caused just by power plants and large 
industries bush proposed a major volunteer effort on the part of 
all americans to generate less wastes and recycle more of the 
waste that is generated 
he said the opportunity to renew the environmental ethic in 
america was an opportunity we cant afford to miss 
i plan to stay involved helping to protect our precious 
environment as long as i am president he asserted 
bushs cleanair proposals were announced june 12 but not 
formally submitted to congress until july 21 
the package calls for a 10billionton reduction in sulfur 
dioxide emissions from power plant and other industrial stacks by 
the year 2000 
sulfur dioxide pollution drifts in the atmosphere with prevailing 
winds and returns to earth as acid rain 
bushs plan also calls for a 2millionton reduction in nitrogen 
oxide emissions and a 40 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions 
which produce urban smog 
bush as he has done in other centennial states planted in 
spokanes riverfront park site of a 1974 worlds fair a sapling 
from a white house elm planted by president john quincy adams in 
1828 
in washington meanwhile the administration proposed a 
modification in the provision of its cleanair bill that would 
permit automakers to average auto emissions to meet antipollution 
requirements 
the modification criticized by environmental groups would still 
allow motor vehicle manufacturers to meet stricter antipollution 
requirements by averaging pollution among engine families 
but it would make clear that reductions under averaging must 
equal the improvement that would be achieved if each model were 
forced to meet the emissions standards current law requires each 
model to meet the standards

general who once served in a un peackeeping force on tuesday 
became president of the general assembly 
in a news conference prior to tuesdays opening of the united 
nations 44th session secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said i think that in the present general assembly there are 
subjects of great importance politically there is namibia the 
middle east afghanistan iraniraq kampuchea cambodia western 
sahara central america and cyprus 
on the social aspect i think it is extremely important that 
this year the general assembly gives importance to real social 
questions not only human rights which always is reserved in first 
place in our concerns but the environment aids and terrorism he 
said 
rain forests were added to the agenda by environmentalists who 
pushed 12 wheelbarrows into the marble lobby of the un 
headquarters and dumped petitions with 3 million signatures asking 
the world body to save the forests 
organizers from the world rainforest movement refused to leave 
without personally meeting perez de cuellar un officials 
confronted by mounds of paper that the organizers said were 
petitions from 23 countries arranged a meeting with the 
secretarygeneral 
he met with a delegation of representatives from malaysia brazil 
india and britain 
the malaysiabased world rainforest movement which says it 
represents 60 nongovernmental organizations is seeking a special 
general assembly session to halt the destruction of rain forests 
a special session of the 159nation assembly only can be called 
at the request of a majority of its member governments and a costly 
special session is considered unlikely 
garba 46 is nigerias ambassador to the united nations 
he is a former foreign minister and has been chairman of the un 
special committee against apartheid and the un special committee 
on peacekeeping operations 
under a system of rotating regional representation the african 
nations nominated the assembly president this year and garba was 
chosen over paul engo cameroons ambassador 
garba retired from the army in 1980 with the rank of major 
general 
in his address to the assembly he said at the age of 22 as a 
captain in the nigerian army i participated in the un 
indiapakistan observer mission where i donned the blue helmet for 
the first time that operation enabled me to appreciate firsthand 
the laudable role of the united nations in conflict resolutions 
that observer group has monitored the truce between pakistan and 
india since 1949 
garba said international peace cannot be secure in a world in 
which nations economies are in decline and inequity exists between 
classes and states 
there is now widespread recognition that the external debt 
crisis has economic political and social consequences he said 
he called for the world bank and international monetary fund as 
well as major donor countries to provide resources for debt 
reduction

colombia has issued arrest warrants for 
two israelis accused of training hit squads for the drug cartels 
waging war on the government an official said tuesday 
acting on a request by the department of administrative security 
colombias equivalent of the fbi a judge issued the warrants monday 
night for a former israeli army colonel yair klein and businessman 
arik acek 
they are wanted for violating laws against conspiring teaching 
and enlisting civilians in military operations without the approval 
of the defense ministry said security department spokeswoman 
divas rojas 
an israeli embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said israel has no extradition treaty with colombia the 
ambassador has been very clear about this he added 
he said israeli police have concluded an investigation into the 
klein case and the supreme court there has to decide what if any 
action to take five other israelis suspected of training gunmen for 
the cartels also were investigated 
ms rojas said klein and acek are thought to have entered 
colombia in august 1988 and to have left the country this year after 
reports surfaced that foreign mercenaries were training private 
armies for the drug lords mostly in the magadelena medio region in 
mountainous central colombia 
british ambassador richard neilson said on colombian tv on 
tuesday that british and colombian intelligence had information in 
march about british and israeli mercenaries training assassination 
squads for the cartels 
the governmemt of colombia had information about british 
mercenaries in colombia in march and we were in position to help 
them the government he said 
he said britain will try to extradite any british who helped 
traffickers train paramilitary groups but it was not known how many 
british may have been involved 
klein now home in tel aviv has said he trained colombian 
farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas he said he 
was unaware they had any involvement with drugs 
in the northern coastal city of barranquilla an army raid 
tuesday in the house of the manager of a milk company turned up a 
ton of pure cocaine four people were arrested the owner pedro 
rodriguez munoz was not at home 
in venezuela police said they would release a man who was 
arrested at a ranch near the colombian border because he bore a 
strong resemblance to jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha a top leader 
of colombias medellin cocaine cartel 
humberto giffuni deputy director of venezuelas judicial 
technical police said the man and three people arrested with him 
monday would be freed immediately 
the drug war took a new twist monday night when a bomb went off 
in front of a crowded shopping center in the capital bogota 
another bomb damaged a bogota telephone company outlet 
it was the first time a bomb was placed in the early evening in a 
populated area four people including a child were injured 
since the crackdown on drug cartels was launched most bombing 
targets have been banks and government buildings and most explosions 
went off late at night when no one was around 
in the past three weeks 45 bombs have gone off in colombia 
killing four people and injuring 118 no one claimed responsibility 
but officials blamed drug barons 
president virgilio barco announced the crackdown after leading 
presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan was assassinated aug 
18 
barco vowed to extradite traffickers wanted in the united states 
colombian eduardo martinez romero was extradited sept 6 to 
atlanta in connection with the laundering of more than 12 billion 
for the medellin cartel 
two other alleged drug traffickers were arrested last week and 
await extradition to the united states 
but drug kingpins on the united states list of the most wanted 
the socalled dirty dozen remain at large and there is no 
indication the government is close to arresting them 
colombias attorney general alfonseo gomez mendez said tuesday 
that is because drug traffickers have infiltrated the army and 
national police 
its not for lack of military power that the big 
narcotraffickers havent been captured gomez said in an 
interview with the radio chain caracol its because they have 
informants inside the police and army who warn them when there will 
be operations to arrest them

development occurred tuesday the same day miss gabor ran from the 
courtroom hearing testimony she didnt like 
on tuesday afternoon officer paul kramer the officer who 
arrested her on june 14 was hospitalized in stable condition

car at the at rodeo drive intersection he was admitted to ucla 
medical center in westwood where he was in stable condition with 
head trauma severe scrapes and bruises 
kramer had already testified but might be needed for further 
testimony it was not immediately known what effect his injury might 
have on miss gabors trial 
earlier tuesday miss gabor collapsed in sobs after stomping out 
of court during one policemans testimony that immediately was 
branded a lie by the star of such films as picture mommy dead 
and queen of outer space 
in afternoon testimony the actress acknowledged scuffling with 
kramer the 6foot4 motorcycle cop who pulled her over on a traffic 
stop 
im a hungarian woman not a milquetoast but she said she 
came to fear the motorcycle officer more than she feared nazis 
during world war ii 
the beverly hills officer actually stopped her twice the day of 
her june 14 arrest the second time after she drove away as he 
attempted to cite her when he closed on her a second time she 
testified she feared he was going to shoot her 
i was saying to myself uh oh zsa zsa gabor now youve had 
it 
she said she sat on a curb handcuffed i was screaming like a 
pig she said 
earlier in the day miss gabor bolted from the courtroom when she 
disagreed with testimony from another officer who assisted in the 
arrest 
i cant take this its a lie miss gabor blurted as she left 
the courtroom seven days into her misdemeanor trial 
defense attorney william graysen immediately led his client back 
into the courtroom and she broke down in sobs municipal judge 
charles g rubin ordered a recess while the former miss hungary 
regained her composure

she looked at me and said you expletive im having your 
job im calling the reagans on this thompson testified miss 
gabor a longtime friend and neighbor of the former president got

kramer testified he was surprised miss gabor struck him saying 
the assault was unprovoked miss gabor a foot shorter and 100 
pounds lighter than kramer said she struck in selfdefense 
graysen is expected to contend that kramer allegedly had a prior 
history of being abusive with citizens pulled over for traffic stops 
if convicted miss gabor faces up to 18 months in jail graysen 
said he will conclude his case with testimony from miss gabor she 
was expected to take the stand friday or early next week 
unable to discuss the case directly miss gabor said last week 
she feared jail because they are filled with lesbians im afraid 
of lesbians she blurted out 
before her courtroom collapse miss gabor told reporters that a 
homosexual group wrote to protest the remarks 
i never said anything about lesbians i got a letter from the 
lesbians they are outraged i have so many friends who are i

former president jimmy carter 
has successfully negotiated with the leftist sandinista government 
for the return of a rebel miskito indian leader after years of exile 
under the deal the sandinistas dropped a ban on brooklyn 
riveras return to nicaragua after rivera agreed to renounce his 
fight against the government refrain from illegal activities and 
cooperate in the process to hold general elections feb 25 
carter said rivera accepted the terms that he and interior 
minister tomas borge agreed to monday during a visit to this 
northeastern seaport carter said rivera would return to nicaragua 
shortly 
rivera left nicaragua in 1981 to lead an indian armed struggle 
against the sandinistas and has been living in neighboring costa 
rica and talks between the government and exiled miskito leader 
head of the most populous tribe of nicaraguan indians had dragged 
for four years 
miskito sumo and rama indian groups largely englishspeaking 
communities that live along nicaraguas caribbean coast have been 
fighting against the sandinistas alongside the ussupported contra 
rebels since 1980 
these are basically the same conditions the sandinistas set for 
the return of nonindian contras under a previous sandinista offer 
rivera was to disarm his followers within 30 days of his return to 
nicaragua 
rivera said tuesday that he expected other indian leaders 
including steadman fagoth and wycliff diego to return the 
agreement however was specifically for rivera 
carter announced the agreement on the rivera issue on his return 
to managua shortly before heading back to atlanta 
the announcement was the highlight of the former presidents 
threeday trip to nicaragua as head of a delegation that will 
monitor elections in february 
carter expressed optimism that the elections would be fair 
the 14party national opposition union the strongest challenger 
to the sandinista national liberation front delivered a letter to 
president daniel ortega accusing the government of failing to live 
up to agreements reached last month 
carter pointed out that the last paragraph of the letter 
reiterated the oppositions willingness to continue taking part in 
the electoral process although there are problems the agreements 
reached give us optimism that the elections will be free and 
fair he said 
he said his observer team plans to organize an independent 
votecount on elections night of the elections but will not release 
its tallies until after the official returns are announced 
the nicaraguan government the supreme electoral council and the 
political opposition invited carter to observe the elections as 
chairman of the council of freely elected heads of state an 
atlantabased organization 
the united nations and the organization of american states also 
will also sent observer teams 
carter also helped monitor the annulled panamanian elections 
earlier this year and has negotiated with ethiopian officials and 
eritrean rebels to end their civil war

a special bipartisan house task force will 
present to the leadership this week a call for a congressional pay 
increase of about 35 percent over two years a congressional said 
tuesday night 
other recommendations would end fees for making speeches and the 
conversion of campaign funds to personal use 
the source who is in a position to know the recommendations and 
who spoke on condition of anonymity cautioned that the entire 
package of rules changes planned by the task force could be changed 
before it is proposed to the full house which must be done by the 
end of october 
the heart of the package is the pay plan which would include 
about a 10 percent raise in 1990 and an additional 25 percent in 
1991 after 1991 members would get costofliving pay increases 
house and senate members currently earn 89500 per year with 
leaders earning more the senate would have to approve any pay 
increases which would apply to both bodies a 35 percent increase 
would make the salary 120825 
a key part of the plan would phase out honoraria fees for 
making speeches often to organizations lobbying for legislation 
over two years since house members now can keep honoraria totaling 
30 percent of their pay the 35 percent salary increase would mean 
no member would lose money by the phaseout 
the honoraria system has been much criticized by watchdog 
organizations such as common cause critics say the fees limited to 
2000 per occasion too often amount to a reward just for showing 
up sometimes at conventions at plush resorts for which the members 
expenses are picked up by the sponsors 
the plan also would phase out the grandfather clause under 
which members who were in congress in january 1980 can convert 
leftover campaign funds to personal use when they retire the date 
when the prohibition would take full effect has not been settled 
the source said 
other provisions of the package call for tightening requirements 
to disclose gifts 
the ethics panel was appointed by former speaker jim wright 
dtexas after lawmakers earlier this year fought a bitter divisive 
battle over a proposed 51 percent pay raise that was rejected after 
a campaign led by consumer advocate ralph nader and others who 
argued that it was excessive 
the 51 percent proposal came from an advisory commission and was 
recommended by president reagan it would have taken effect without 
a vote unless rejected by congress wright had devised a plan to 
raise salaries by 30 percent in return for dropping honoraria but 
house members overwhelmingly voted to reject such a plan 
backers of a raise say members have not taken costofliving 
increases in recent years and need a substantial increase to catch 
up with inflation many members feel they must maintain two homes 
one in washington and one in their districts and face expenses that 
others with similar salaries dont have the supporters say 
the task force of 10 members is equally divided between the 
parties and chaired by reps vic fazio dcalif and lynn martin 
rill

the three airports serving new york city cannot 
prevent people from giving out literature and asking for 
contributions a federal judge ruled 
the decision by us district judge mary johnson lowe came in a 
1975 suit brought by the international society for krishna 
consciousness inc against the port authority of new york and new 
jersey 
lowe on monday adopted a magistrates recommendation that the 
port authority regulation which prohibited continuous and 
repetitive solicitation violated the first amendment rights of 
krishna members who give out literature about their religion and 
ask for contributions 
arthur berg a port authority lawyer said the ruling would not 
be immediately noticeable at kennedy laguardia and newark airports 
because an interim agreement with the krishnas allowed two 
representatives at each airport while the case was pending 
he said the agreement would likely continue during the appeal 
we do not believe airports are a public forum berg said

federal officials praised 
burroughs wellcome cos decision to reduce the wholesale price of 
azt by 20 percent but some aids activists say the cut isnt deep 
enough 
this is a step in the right direction but a very small step 
says peter staley of the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash 
power its not enough 
burroughs wellcome co announced monday that it will lower the 
wholesale cost of the only federally approved aids treatment citing 
production efficiencies and research that suggests an increasing 
demand for the drug 
the expected growth in patient population coupled with recent 
production economies will reduce somewhat our financial risk and 
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug 
was first introduced said te haigler jr burroughs president

oil companies have obtained waivers from the 
federal communications commission to eliminate radio officers on 
many tankers a costcutting move that critics contend will increase 
the chances of oil spills 
the fcc requirement that all large ships carry at least one 
trained radio officer originated in the 1930s when ships needed 
someone skilled in the pitpatpit of morse code says exxon 
shipping co spokesman leslie c rogers 
since that kind of radio telegraphy is obsolete theres no 
longer a need for a job category like this on these merchant 
ships rogers said in a telephone interview monday 
but two unions the american radio officers association and the 
radio officers union which represent about 600 seagoing officers 
are objecting to the waivers on safety grounds

a year ago international arbitration ended 
the last border dispute between egypt and israel a squabble over a 
250acre strip of beach and the plush hotel on it 
israel lost 
now six months after the israelis ceded taba to egypt the 
former aviyasonesta beach hotel is struggling to develop an 
egyptian image while catering to its main clientele israelis 
its still the same hotel said joe sultan the general 
manager through successive owners and management chains but he 
said instead of a waiter called moshe we now have moussa 
opened in 1982 by its builder the egyptianborn israeli eli 
papouchado the 10story 327room luxury hotel has panoramic views 
of the gulf of aqaba and the sinai peninsulas rugged mountains it 
quickly became a favorite among israelis whose army seized the sinai 
in the arabisraeli war of 1967 
although taba had been in dispute since early 1982 when israel 
refused to return it with the rest of sinai under terms of a 1979 
peace agreement israelis nonetheless were shocked on sept 29 
1988 to find the place no longer belonged to them after 
deliberating 18 months international arbitrators ruled that 
egyptian claims prevailed and ordered israel to end its occupation 
months of haggling followed over special facilities for israeli 
tourists and compensation to owner papouchado the settlement was 
37 million but egypt finally raised its flag over taba on march 
15 
egyptian nationals marched into the hotel tabas only 
significant structure to claim jobs 
outside israeli employees burned street barricades of automobile 
tires and demonstrated to protest their uncertain future about 280 
of the 306 israeli workers last march have been laid off to comply 
with egyptian law that limits foreign employment to 10 percent of 
the work force 
but manager sultan said in a telephone interview the hotel staff 
has become a model of coexistence 
this is beautiful he said i wish the governments would 
take an example from the harmony 
many details remained unsettled and confusion reigned at the 
turnover in march but much of that has dissipated as technical 
problems have been ironed out 
israelis stayed away in the first weeks after the turnover and 
the hotels occupancy rate fell from better than 90 percent to 
around 40 percent sultan said that by august it had recovered much 
of the lost ground 
hotel shopowners mostly israelis feared working under egypts 
more stringent import controls but theyve settled into their new 
state of affairs 
prices on menus are being changed gradually to egyptian pounds 
from israeli shekels and us dollars 
taba at the northern tip of the gulf of aqaba 230 miles east of 
cairo was a wasteland at the end of a desert wadi when israel 
captured the sinai in the 1967 war 
thus egypt has no infrastructure there to support the hotel and 
must buy water electricity and some goods from israel tabas 
telephone lines are linked through israel 
and because there is no housing at taba other than the hotel 
egyptian employees must travel 90 miles a day to and from nuweiba to 
go to work 
the 28 israeli employees commute from eilat the israeli port 
which is close by they work in positions where hebrew is necessary 
to communicate with patrons 
the egyptian personnel manager aly abdelaziz said israeli 
singers and two belly dancers still perform but with fewer hebrew 
songs 
although their flag flies over taba now egyptians havent 
flocked to the resort 
one reason may be room rates of 150 a night few egyptians can 
afford even the reduced rate of 54 which is high for a country 
with an average monthly takehome pay of 40 
but fuad sultan egypts tourism minister said plans are under 
way to promote taba worldwide as a warmweather resort and to equip 
a nearby landing strip for large airplanes 
until taba was returned to egypt it was only a satellite of 
eilat he said 
now its our goal to create something that says this is 
really egypt

environmentalists are concerned 
that a quest for gold uranium and other minerals threatens severe 
damage to venezuelas amazon and the way of life of the territorys 
12 indian tribes 
the territory of about 70000 square miles of jungle and granite 
is an an extension of brazils amazon already exploited and damaged 
by the clearing of rain forests for development and by wildcat 
mining 
the mighty orinoco river forms in venezuelas federal amazonas 
territory and makes its way eastward to the caribbean sea 
but the territory also contains precious minerals in its soil and 
riverbeds mainly gold and uranium and the quest for them and the 
riches they bring threatens a fragile ecosystem and the last of the 
forest indians whose way of life goes back millenia 
most of the territory is unexplored and studies of its mineral 
riches are mere estimates 
venezuela declared the amazonas region a federal reserve in 1972 
off limits to all economic development projects 
but in apparent contradiction of the laws the ministry of mines 
in caracas the nations capital has granted concessions to some 
miners operating inside the territorys three national parks and 
other concessions to gold buyers 
at the same time the ministry of the environment has been 
accused of catering to developmentalists those who would like 
to see venezuela reap economic benefits from its land 
environmentalists complained in january when the government of 
thenpresident jaime lusinchi gave the guayana venezuela corp the 
rights to begin development projects in mining and other industries 
in previously virgin amazonas 
the corporation known by its spanish initials cvg is a state 
entity that has monopolized iron aluminum and gold exploitation in 
nearby bolivar state in southeastern venezuela 
the lusinchi governments decree gives cvg power to move indians 
from their villages when deemed necessary and it has even asked 
indian leaders to work with it in cataloguing the regions potential 
riches 
the cvg plans to create extensive mining zones and rubber tapping 
plantations claims aida santana head of caracas central 
universitys amazonas project 
under the project students travel by river canoe into remote 
indian villages to spend months as part of their training in 
medicine anthropology biology and other specialties 
santana maintains that the cvgs development plans would create 
in amazonas another kilometer 88 an infamous strip of 
malariaand viceridden gold mines in bolivar state 
cvg denies that it plans unbalanced development of the region 
saying it will incorporate environmental impact reports into its 
plans 
however santana said any plans for exploitation of the 
amazonas are not justified the resources are nonrenewable and 
their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice and the 
extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study 
but the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too 
late 
signs in puerto ayacucho the capital of the territory with a 
population of 40000 along the orinoco river already advertise to 
buy gold 
indians have moved to puerto ayacucho from their forest homes and 
roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments 
much of the mining in the territorys national parks especially 
in yapacana park at the confluence of the orinoco and ventuari 
rivers is done by indians generally of the piaroa and guajibo 
ethnic groups said rafael garcia of the national parks institute 
the indians usually use rudimentary mining techniques such as 
picks and shovels and sieves he said but the creoles 
venezuelans of mixed blood who travel down to barter gold usually 
rip them off 
garcia added that in addition to exploiting the indian miners 
outsiders were using mercury to extract gold from riverbeds 
poisoning the water and causing extensive damage to wildlife and the 
indians themselves 
roman catholic missionaries in the southeast of the territory 
home to roughly 9000 yanomami indians who also inhabit areas of 
brazil recently blamed gold miners for the deaths by mercury 
poisoning of some 100 yanomami children 
an invasion of about 3000 brazilian gold wildcatters into the 
venezuelan amazon at the headwaters of the orinoco created a public 
outcry in april 
the brazilians were eventually airlifted by venezuelan and 
brazilian military craft back to brazil but not before they caused 
extensive damage to the headwaters 
the brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation 
within 600 feet of the river scientists estimated the damage would 
take hundreds of years to repair 
the public outrage not only over the environmental damage but 
the assault on national sovereignty led for calls for the 
creation of a national park along the sierra de parima and the 
headwaters of the orinoco and the use of national guard troops and 
student volunteers to man the park system in amazonas

the moment the elevator door opened clareise 
jones sensed the danger she sidestepped a mound of garbage and 
shone a light into the basement corners we dont want to stay 
here too long she said 
she tiptoed in and immediately found evidence fresh rat 
droppings over there she said spotlighting two holes in the 
floor rat burrows 
and there a dead rat 
nasty jones said very nasty 
jones poking into dank places in the largely toney upper east 
side this day is one of new york citys 22 rat inspectors 
rats live in every area of the city surviving off abandoned food 
from the slums and in the sewers to the swanky suites and strawberry 
fields of central park 
no one has taken a census but a conservative count puts the rat 
population at one for each of the citys 8 million human residents 
some experts say it may be as high as four or five rats per person 
the numbers indicate new york is a rat paradise and those whose 
job is to rid the city of the nocturnal rodents agree 
that doesnt mean the rat killers havent made progress three 
hundred rat bites are recorded annually now but thats down from 
about 750 a year two decades ago 
the rat control program has won praise from experts and 
officials from cities in europe asia and elsewhere in the united 
states have come here for training 
the new york city program for all of the problems that come 
with large cities has one of the finest targeted urban rat control 
programs in the nation said jerry hershovitz a publichealth 
administrator for the centers for disease control in atlanta who 
worked with city rat control programs before federal funds for them 
were cut several years ago 
solomon peeples new yorks pest control director calls himself 
a professional killer a hit man 
i kill rats he said in his deep baritone the fourlegged 
kind 
peeples oversees about 1000 full and parttime workers and a 
budget of 10 million a year the youthful 65yearold has held 
nearly every position in the division 
his crusade started about 25 years ago when as a health inspector 
he went on a call to a rundown brooklyn apartment 
this small innocent child had been bitten by a rat on his 
wrist he said something all of a sudden hit me i decided i 
was going to do something about this 
he transferred to the pest control division which had just 
formed and over the years his expertise grew until he knew a lot 
about rats and about people 
i hate to concede the fact that rats are smart it really 
bothers me he said in a recent interview the other part of 
this problem is that people are dumb 
some people unknowingly do their best to fatten rats he said in 
his sparsely furnished office a poster of wellfed rats behind him 
from seven oclock to 11 oclock at night its a rats holiday 
in new york he said thats the major tv time and people all 
over this city rush home make dinner and go to the living room to 
watch tv 
in the meantime rats are in the kitchen having their 
dinner peeples said if you have steak for dinner the rat has 
steak for dinner and if you leave your food out overnight well 
you are just inviting the rat for breakfast 
peeples marvels at the abilities of his nemesis 
rats can walk up the sides of buildings 
rats can swim better than mark spitz in his prime 
rats can gnaw through concrete 
they also gnaw at electrical wires setting off fires rats ruin 
fabrics contaminate food and transmit a variety of diseases through 
bites and through fleas they carry 
the rodents new york has mostly norway rats and black rats 
generally live about a year producing up to seven litters that 
average eight to 12 young each 
rats are savvy in sniffing out poisons they often travel in 
packs and when one finds a trap it will urinate on the bait and 
sound warnings 
others develop immunities this apparently happened in the 
mid1970s in the bronx the surviving breed was called super rat 
peeples switched poisons and super rat fell 
his division focuses on prevention by educating people to put 
food away and patch holes in walls but it also reacts to rat 
complaints by sending out inspectors extermination teams and 
cleanup crews negligent landlords are billed for cleanup costs 
clareise jones sent the landlord a summons following her tour of 
the upper east side basement where a sign read if you dont want 
mice please put garbage in cans garbage sprawled underneath 
jones who has never been bitten by a rat stayed only a few 
minutes long enough to see the dead rat 
fleas and mites can jump off dead rats onto any warm body nearby 
she said 
lets get out of here

gather round the electronic campfire buckaroos 
and abc will show you a preview tonight of its new old west series 
about the gallant lads of the pony express the young riders 
on second thought read a good western instead maybe something 
like he rode tall in the saddle until his blisters broke 
for tonights the young riders the series starts its 
regular thursday night run tomorrow is so mundane and 
clicheridden that teenagers who see it may say so this is how 
the west was wan 
occasionally exhibiting beautiful sunrises and sunsets it 
purports to tell how the pony express dashed the mail by horseback 
from st joseph mo to sacramento calif 
this was back in the halcyon days before fax machines ruined 
everything 
our young riders only orphans need apply as riders risk 
hostile indians brigands the elements and nielsen families to get 
the mail through they are five in number and the show centers on 
the kid a decent rugged sort essayed by ty miller 
the others are a varied lot one swaggers is tough and eager to 
use his pistol another is a halfbreed he wears an earring another 
can hear but cant speak due to a childhood disease that left him 
bald 
for history buffs theres even a william cody who in later 
years would make a living in touring wild west shows 
here he is so cocky that teaspoon the grizzled old plainsman 
who is teaching survival skills to the new riders is moved to ask 
you think youre pretty hot stuff dont you yup young 
cody says 
teapoon fixes him with a steady gaze cowpies he sneers 
well even though the fine actor anthony zerbe plays teaspoon 
this retort indicates a minor flaw in the show such as an awful 
script an awful script sometimes means there will be more of the 
same which does not bode well for the future of this series 
true there is a tiny surprise in tonights premiere lou the 
fifth young rider proves in one regard to be in violation of pony 
express rules which prompts the kid to warn you wont fool 
people forever 
true the plot traditions of the old west are attempted here the 
regulars include the handsome town marshal brett cullen who is 
sweet on a lovely lady melissa leo who is sort of the young 
riders den mother 
and tonights show does have two old west staples a band of 
heartless villains led by a man with rotten teeth and a scar on his 
face and a rousing chase scene involving hostile indians 
but there is no way any of this can work in a show that not only 
has hostile indians foiled by firecrackers but also a grizzled 
hardbitten plainsman who says cowpies

i dont know if spirit should be called bewitched the 
sequel but like the young riders the opening show dealing 
with bowling and character introductions has a script that gives 
lame a bad name 
you get the feeling this newcomer is in trouble when at the 
start of the show luz teenage daughter complains to old dad that 
her teenage brother told one of her classmates that i used to be 
a siamese twin

indications from around the country show many 
homeowners still anxious to exchange variable rate mortgages for 
fixedrate loans even if the numbers might not add up 
for many people they really dont 
is it worthwhile for you to dump your existing mortgage in order 
to save two percentage points even if the lower rate cuts your 
monthly payments by enough to allow you to put money in the bank or 
go out once or twice a month 
maybe not even if your friends financial counselor neighbors 
and spouse say go ahead if you do be sure you know the cost the 
length of time youll be keeping the mortgage and a lot about your 
local market 
1 to refinance usually means a fee of 1 percent or 2 percent of 
the total mortgage and sometimes as much 3 percent these are 
points but seldom are they the only charge 
the additional charges might include origination application 
appraisal legal and other fees in some instances they can add 
another 15 percent of the mortgage amount if so your upfront 
total is then 35 points 
the cost of these fees should make you think again especially if 
you are remortgaging to lower your interest charges by just one or 
two percentage points the charges might be heftier than the savings 
sears mortgage corp offers this formula to clarify your thinking 
add the points being charged by the lender to the total amount 
of fees expressed in points two points plus another 15 points for 
fees is your total upfront cost 
determine the difference between the interest rate you are now 
paying and the rate being offered if you are paying 115 percent 
currently and have the opportunity for a new rate of 95 percent 
unlikely your answer is 2 
divide that 2 or whatever number applies into the total points 
the answer will be the number of years required for you to break 
even that is to pay off the points thereafter you are ahead of 
the game but up to that point you are behind 
if you were saving just one percentage point of interest and 
your total points was 35 it would take you 35 years to break 
even if you were paying 45 points it would take you about 45 
years to break even 
2 these factors have special meanings depending on the owners 
age and likelihood of remaining in the house relatively few people 
pay off mortgages at times the average mortgage has had a life 
span of just seven years 
3 all this should be considered in relation to whats happening 
in your local market not just on what you hear about national 
averages prices vary from one neighborhood to another interest 
rates from one city to another 
never forget that real estate markets are cyclical more so than 
almost any other segment of the economy they have ups and downs 
if your area is down and likely to fall further then interest 
rates might also fall even if only by a fraction of a point more 
importantly your lender might become friendlier perhaps even 
knocking off one full point 
try to get a feel for what might happen nationally too if you 
think rates will fall you might consider delaying your refinancing 
the opposite of course also applies act quickly if youre not 
likely to get better terms 
these factors are extremely important in determing whether to 
stay with a variable rate mortgage or transfer to a fixed if rates 
rise your fixed loan doesnt if rates fall you remain at the 
higher rate and vice versa 
finally the best deal might be with your current lender lenders 
dont like to lose good customers conceivably they might make you 
an offer you cannot refuse

even in a city where titanic deals are fairly 
ordinary the one the william morris talent agency cut for itself on 
the cosby show was a whopper 
for simply introducing bill cosby to the shows producers 
william morris negotiated a contract bringing the agency 10 percent 
of every dollar the cosby show generates a windfall in excess 
of 100 million since 1984 
the pact dramatizes the power that agencies like william morris 
the creative artists agency and international creative management 
now wield in hollywood especially through packaging tv shows 
with packaging a longtime practice in the movie industry agents 
deliver the key ingredients for a hit movie or tv series however 
packaging also sometimes provides agents with extravagant payments 
usually a percentage of a shows revenues for little more than 
introducing one agency client to a producer 
for some the practice smacks of artistic extortion and those 
involved in making deals are reluctant to talk about it 
its al capone saying fellas you wanna open a bar in south 
chicago this is the deal my beer my laundry my glasses my 
bartender my union my trucks said a top tv writerproducer who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
what bothers the production community is that package fees come 
from the production itself taking away funds that could help make a 
better project and for some producers paying a package commission 
can mean the difference between profit and loss 
i think packaging is absolutely the worst waste of money that 
you could possibly imagine said writerproducer danny arnold one 
of the few who would allow his name to be used i think its an 
extortion and one of the worst abuses in this business 
arnold whose credits include the old tv series barney miller 
bewitched and that girl recently signed a deal with disney 
co to create tv and movie products 
at one time and occasionally today television packaging 
represented a real service a packaged show a perry como or danny 
thomas special the dick van dyke show might have included a 
writer a director a star other related talent and perhaps even 
advertisers bookkeepers and lawyers 
the movie business still represents an area in which packagers 
serve an essential role for no extra fee no package commission 
agents bring together several clients to form an outstanding team 
such was the case with oliver stone and the cast of platoon and 
the recent mississippi burning and rain man 
network executives say privately that as much as they despise 
television packaging they are reluctant to do anything about it 
because if one network stops the practice another network will 
accept the deals 
cbs however was so concerned about packaging fees that it held 
discussions during last years writers strike to see whether the 
strike could be settled if packaging fees were abolished the talks 
failed to result in any action 
several top producers maintain that the three top agencies 
william morris caa and icm sometimes are interested more in 
negotiating big packaging commissions for themselves than in 
promoting their clients careers or making good shows 
there are a lot of deals that dont get made that should have 
because somebody objects to a package commission said one top tv 
executive 
at least one tv executive has asked california legislators to 
address the package issue but the department of industrial 
relations which regulates agents fee schedules does not determine 
package fee limits said spokesman richard stevens 
the top agencies are privately held and declined to be 
interviewed caa operates with almost comical secrecy ray kurtzman 
head of caas business affairs department would not even decline to 
be interviewed unless he could do so off the record 
thus it is hard to pinpoint every packaged show however 
published reports suggest that the cosby show roseanne 
golden girls empty nest beauty and the beast and the 
famous teddy z are just a few of the packaged shows now on the air 
the packaged talent in most situation comedies is the 
writerproducer but almost anybody can be packaged in a miniseries 
or movie the payoffs can be tremendous caa more than any other 
agency in town is rolling in money 
to appreciate caas embarrassment of riches consider the case of 
the caa ficus tree im pei the famed architect who designed the 
agencys elaborate new office selected caas huge tree from a 
florida grove and then shipped it to mexico for a years 
acclimatization 
the privately held agency representing more than 600 top clients 
like paul newman bill murray jane fonda and madonna grossed 65 
million last year and caa president michael ovitz himself made 10 
million according to the entertainment industry newsletter show biz 
news 
by controlling so many leading actors writers and directors the 
superagents can cut deals pretty much on their own terms producers 
not willing to play along often find doors locked 
television and movie executives are convinced that anyone 
speaking publicly against the superagents will suffer greatly 
perhaps kept from signing an agencys top talent 
those few agents who do grant interviews defend packaging saying 
it provides a real service often helping to create a hit show 
it doesnt need justification because it works said arnold 
rifkin a founder of triad artists when a network buys a show 
thats successful they increase their revenues and youve 
created that potential for them 
chet migden executive director of the association of talent 
agents said package deals generate more work for actors directors 
and writers in order to get work for clients agents began to 
think creatively about putting properties together 
without package fees agents take a percentage commission 
usually 10 percent on their clients paychecks and no more with 
packaging fees agents charge from 6 percent to 10 percent on the 
total cost of each and every episode in a tv series 
with a normal commission for example a writer paid 50000 a 
week by a situation comedy would give his agent 5000 a week the 
packaged clients keep 100 percent of their checks with a package 
deal on that sitcom costing 700000 a week the agent collects up 
to 70000 weekly plus up to 10 percent of everything the series 
makes in the fruitful syndication market 
producers are trapped by the package commission because networks 
will not buy shows unless they have the top talent usually covered 
by packages if one producer refuses to pay a package fee there is 
always another who will 
the agencies arent fools said one television producer 
they know if we need these things to make the programs we produce 
more noticeable they can extract a premium for that 
the networks continue to ask only for the a players and 
the a players are controlled by fewer and fewer agencies

donna white has a 500 fingernail on her 
pinkie its 14 karat gold 2 inches long and adorned with nine 
dangling charms 
in a society so sated that its garbage provides meals for the 
homeless nail art has become a multimilliondollar business 
booths and salons are springing up as fast as the human nail can 
grow 
when i was growing up in new orleans the only women who 
painted their nails red worked in brothels says manicurist karen 
garlow now women seeking a genteel look can have cameos painted on 
their nails the more showy can have diamonds or pearls drilled in 
for just plain funky theres no limit 
one woman wanted bowling balls painted on her nails for the night 
of her local tournament and after the washington redskins won the 
super bowl in 1987 dozens of fans had the phone number of 
quarterback doug williams painted onto all 10 nails toes too in 
some cases 
when dorothys fiance asked her what stone she wanted for her 
engagement she requested a threecarat diamond drilled into her 
nail itll still be on my finger she says asking that her 
last name be withheld 
now that women have become accepted in the work force and 
realize they dont have to look like men they use nail polish and 
art as accessories for their wardrobe it makes them look 
wellgroomed dressed up says garlow 
and not just women garlow recently painted art work on the nails 
of 20 3yearolds as entertainment at a birthday party you know 
instead of playing pin the donkey 
ms white also a manicurist is adept at using an air brush and 
other art tools to create fancy nails despite her own 2inch talons 
the canvas for most of the art is an acryllic substance 
shaped into the form of nails to make the human nail longer and 
harder a set of artificial nails costs anywhere from 40 to 75 
and upkeep runs about 25 every two or three weeks thats for 
just regular polishing and filing 
nail art runs the gamut of prices as little as 2 a nail for 
simple sparkles or foil paper and as high as 2000 for precious 
stones 
snails a floridabased nail art supply business estimates its 
gross sales this year at about 1 million says owner marlene 
sortino 
she recently moved her offices to the east coast from los 
angeles where nail art first gained fashion in the united states 
expecting a business slump instead her sales have tripled she 
says 
ms sortino also exports her products to australia saudi arabia 
and other farflung spots 
as in the case of many trends california is frequently cited as 
the birthplace of nail art but the ornate decoration actually is 
centuriesold in china long nails were a mark of distinction 
setting the nobles apart from the working class 
robin weir a top society hairdresser in washington has a 
collection of customdesigned protectors used by chinese women to 
guard their jewelencrusted nails which were sometimes grown to as 
much as one foot 
weir who used to do first lady nancy reagans hair and nails 
has judged a number of nail art competitions around the united 
states 
mrs reagan had nails so thin when she first came to the white 
house you could read a newspaper through them weir says but 
she refused artificial nails opting for a naturebased 
nailhardening treatment and subdued polish 
the art competitions held on local and national levels are a 
chance to win thousands of dollars in prizes provided by cosmetics 
manufacturers to promote their products says jacquelyn g randolph 
chairwoman of the washington cosmetology association nail fashion 
committee 
she estimates nail industry sales around the country including 
nail art at 15 billion or more 
ms randolph who holds a degree in business administration and 
accounting from georgetown university opened her nail salon four 
years ago she constantly experiments with new designs her latest 
discovery being hologram paper pasted onto nails in iridescent 
geometric patterns 
now shes turning her attention to male nails 
she already has noticed that many high school boys in washington 
paint art on their pinkies whether that will catch on with older 
men remains to be seen 
but she says you dont have to sacrifice your manhood to get 
artificial nails a manicure doesnt mean youre a sissy

they worked together in the civil rights movement and share a 
faith that recognizes no racial boundaries but christs flock in 
the united states remains largely divided into black and white sheep 
gains in integration in business government and education have 
not been matched in the church which some observers say may be the 
nations most segregated institution 
why 
isnt it obvious its racism thats what brought about the 
black church since its inception slavery and it hasnt 
changed said the rev amos jones jr director of christian 
education for the national baptist convention usa inc 
more than seven in 10 black americans say they are methodists or 
baptists according to a 1988 gallup poll yet in the nations 
largest protestant denomination the 148 millionmember southern 
baptist convention only an estimated 3 percent are black in the 9 
millionmember united methodist church an estimated 4 percent of 
members are black 
in the roman catholic church a black priest has started his own 
church in washington dc and the nations black bishops have 
condemned racism within the us church although the 53 
millionmember body has more black members an estimated 2 million 
than any other predominantly white christian group 
the segregation is even greater in the black churches 
a fraction of a fraction of 1 percent is the estimated number 
of whites in the national baptist convention usa inc according 
to jones officials in the 3 millionmember african methodist 
episcopal church estimate onetenth of 1 percent of its members are 
white 
sunday morning is the most segregated time in the country 
said the rev charles white a white presbyterian pastor who is 
cochairman of the north american interfaith network 
white said there is a profound difference between the teachings 
of christianity and the way it adapts to the society around it 
religion more often than not serves to bolster our own 
identities if we are at heart racist and i believe at heart both 
blacks and whites are racist then we ought not to be surprised that 
religion bolsters that he said 
the attempt by the rev george a stallings to form an 
unauthorized parish for black catholics in washington is full of 
historical precedent introduced to christianity through slavery 
black americans have for centuries moved away from predominantly 
white churches into churches they had more control over and felt 
comfortable in 
once criticized for serving as a barrier to blacks in their 
efforts to make gains in american society the black church has 
enjoyed a resurgence since the late 1960s when blacks and other 
ethnic groups began to question the value of assimilation and place 
greater reliance on institutions that preserved their heritage 
in predominantly white groups people of black heritage often 
feel like theyre the invisible man theyre there but not ever 
seen said bishop cecil bishop president of the board of bishops 
of the african methodist episcopal zion church 
despite the solidarity many within predominantly white churches 
showed in the civil rights movement of a generation ago the racism 
that caused the black church remains today if in more subtle forms 
according to black church leaders 
jones said black churches address the needs of black americans 
while many predominantly white churches embrace the status quo 
for example he said southern baptists are hardpressed to say 
anything against apartheid hunger in mississippi racism among 
elected officials 
some officials in predominantly white churches contend black 
churches make exaggerated claims of racism because they are fearful 
of losing members to churches actively seeking to integrate their 
pews 
the southern baptist convention is on record as condemning 
apartheid hunger and racism said the rev sid smith of that 
denominations black church development board 
i do not mean to imply we have arrived for we have not 
smith said but we are not the oldschool racist denomination of a 
generation ago 
the black church also is not without its own debates on 
prejudice in the african methodist episcopal church for example 
there is only one native bishop in the churchs six episcopal 
districts in africa last year the church elected three bishops to 
serve west africa central africa and south africa all were from 
the united states 
robert h reid editor of the ame christian recorder said 
church officials used to say african blacks were not qualified to be 
bishops that is no longer true and that would have been no 
longer true for decades he said 
still jones said unlike some white churches the doors of the 
black church have always been open 
weve never had a closeddoor policy as white southern 
baptists southern methodists presbyterians have had weve been 
the ones rejected and turned away jones said 
but officials at the nations largest churches say there has been 
some movement toward integration 
in the southern baptist convention which split from northern 
baptists in the 1840s because of its defense of slavery six state 
conventions have elected black presidents and among protestant 
churches we put more money into the black community than any 
other denomination today period smith said 
barbara ricks thompson the general secretary of the commission 
on religion and race of the united methodist church said her 
denomination is giving blacks greater leadership roles for example 
while approximately 4 percent of the church members are black 10 of 
the churchs 49 active bishops are black 
as the estimated number of black catholics has more than doubled 
from 900000 to 2 million in 20 years the church has established a 
national office for black catholics 
deacon ronald walker a black clergyman from buffalo ny 
recalled his baptist grandfather telling him catholicism is the 
church thats going to take a mule to heaven 
but he stayed within the church and eventually sought his 
vocation there 
i was searching for something all my life i love the church 
the roots of the church go back to my grandmother and mother 
walker said 
when he was deciding whether to become a deacon what impressed 
him was that there was an openness a reception and my status as 
being black didnt matter

in scandinavia people drink to get drunk not 
too often but with gusto as one authority says its part of the 
northern culture the governments of sweden norway and finland 
try to control the consumption of alcohol by making it expensive 
and in the process are making a lot of money 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the crowds begin to gather at noon on 
friday by 3 pm customers are spilling into the street 
by closing time at 6 pm the waiting lines run into the hundreds 
as people try to buy their weekend ration of wine beer or hard 
liquor at the staterun store 
its not a matter of shortage but of government attempts to make 
drinking difficult and to make a lot of money in the process 
swedes have a hedonistic way of drinking says hans klette a 
law professor at lund university its part of the northern 
culture 
bjorn hibell director of the swedish council for information on 
alcohol and other drugs says we drink in the scandinavian way 
not too often but a lot we drink more to get intoxicated than in 
other countries 
though scandinavian governments try to control the consumption of 
alcohol at the same time they profit from it through taxes that 
boost the price to the consumer to 10 times the cost 
in sweden finland and norway alcohol is sold legally only in 
state stores at governmentset prices only the soviet union has a 
similar system in europe 
prices are meant to be prohibitive 
finland raised liquor prices twice last year to discourage heavy 
drinkers pushing up the cost of a bottle of scotch to 3640 sales 
dipped briefly but quickly returned to normal 
swedens parliament is considering legislation to reduce the 
level of alcohol tolerated for drivers to virtually nil the legal 
limit in scandinavia already is lower than in most of europe at 
005 percent alcohol in the blood 
courts in the three countries link fines for drunken driving to 
an offenders income a norwegian lawyer set the record this year 
after failing a breath test in a spot road check he was fined 
16000 
compared with other countries alcohol consumption per person is 
low finland rates 26th in the world sweden is 31st and norway is 
33rd 
but scandinavians rarely have a casual glass of wine with dinner 
a cold beer to quench a hot thirst or a predinner aperitif 
a small percentage of the people maybe 10 percent drink about 
half the alcohol sold hibell says 
drinking is ingrained in national customs from the protocol of a 
formal evening party to the celebrations of crayfish day which 
falls on aug 10 
on that day swedes wear party hats tie red napkins below their 
chins sing boisterous drinking songs and plunder a bowl of the 
small lobsterlike shellfish custom dictates that each claw is 
washed down with a glass of schnapps about 20 crayfish make a meal 
the culture of alcohol may have its origins in the chilly climate 
and the long dreary winters the vikings were said to have an 
affinity for mead and other strong drink some social observers say 
the normally shy scandinavians need alcohol to open up 
as early as the 18th century swedens king gustav iii saw liquor 
as a main source of income and urged drinking as an act of 
patriotism in the 19th century swedish companies often paid their 
workers in booze 
excessive drinking led to a powerful temperance movement now 150 
years old sweden imposed rationing in 1917 limiting men to three 
liters of spirits a month and less for women ration books lasted 
until 1955 
prohibition was introduced in norway and finland with as little 
success as it had in the united states 
today advertising alcoholic beverages is forbidden unlike other 
stores liquor outlets are closed evenings and weekends the idea 
is that alcohol shouldnt be too available or too cheap hibell 
says 
the cheapest scotch is sold in sweden at 24 for a fifth and for 
32 in norway in finland a bottle of good 12yearold scotch is 
now up to 60 
tight regulation on liquor supplies created an underground market 
for moonshine in norway police arrested two men last march who 
claimed to be horse breeders but who were accused of building 
stills in their stalls producing 1000 liters a day 
figures published in sweden say about 10 percent of the alcohol 
sold is moonshine 
swedish statistics say 3274 people died in 1986 from alcoholism 
cirrhosis of the liver and other diseases in which alcohol was a 
probable factor that figure compares with 1256 alcoholrelated 
deaths in 1965 
about 9 percent of fatal traffic accidents are linked to 
drinking according to figures compiled by hibells organization 
there is some evidence of a longterm improvement surveys of 
drinking habits among conscripted soldiers show that those who 
reported getting drunk at least several times a month dropped from 
68 percent in 1971 to 42 percent in 1987 
the willingness to drink at any price means enormous tax income 
for the governments 
in 1987 finland earned 85 percent of its national budget from 
its alcohol tax almost enough to pay its entire health care bill 
including medical research 
sweden reckoned on 131 billion in alcohol revenue in its 1989 
budget and plowed back 86 million to fight alcoholism 
of the 24 a swede pays for a bottle of whisky the stateowned 
importer takes 146 for buying bottling labeling and distributing 
the drink to the retailer the stateowned retailer systembolaget 
takes 93 cents the rest 2161 is tax 
drinking habits are changing largely due to government efforts 
steering people away from the brutally strong locally distilled 
spirits and vodkas to wine and beer 
we have become a winedrinking country in the last 10 years 
says goran sandberg a director of the wine and spirit corp 
swedens stateowned importer we have grown up gastronomically 
as the sole importer for an entire nation the company wields 
power in the winemaking world far outstripping swedens comparative 
size the swedes helped establish australian vineyards buying half 
the wine exports of that country on the opposite side of the globe 
the company boasts being the worlds largest customer of wine 
importing 100 million liters a year from 27 countries the wine is 
stored in caverns originally built for the defense department as 
bomb shelters

for george bush this weeks education summit 
with the nations governors provides a unique opportunity to redeem 
a campaign pledge to become the education president but the 
meeting could also leave him vulnerable to blame for the failings of 
americas schools as no president has ever been 
by convening the governors for only the third time in the 
nations history the president has raised expectations that under 
his leadership the country will find ways to remedy persistent 
shortcomings in its schools 
most of the meetings at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville on wednesday and thursday will take place behind 
closed doors the white house says the governors wanted it that way 
were going to have some rollupyoursleeve meetings said 
the president who wants the summit to produce new ideas that can 
help us develop national educational goals and objectives 
americas schools are not making the grade complained bush 
citing a recent comparison of 13yearolds in a dozen countries that 
placed american students last in math and near the bottom in science 
were spending more money on education than most other 
countries and frankly getting less in terms of our investment he 
told reporters last week 
the educational system is basically wellfed but its 
undernourished said bush we must find innovative accountable 
ways to improve performance 
the first time a president summoned the states chief executives 
to a summit was in 1908 when theodore roosevelt brought them 
together to discuss how to conserve americas natural resources the 
second time was in 1933 when franklin d roosevelt sought their 
advice on the great depression 
by investing this session with the stature of a summit the 
president has aroused hopes that as arkansas gov bill clinton put 
it bush will assume some personal responsibility for the future 
of the quality of education 
once you pick up this ball you pretty well got to run with it 
if you try to put it down after the summits over then i think you 
have dashed expectations disappointed people a divided country 
said clinton a democrat who tried but failed to increase taxes this 
year to raise teacher salaries 
apart from bushs education secretary lauro f cavazos no 
educators will take part in the deliberations and the governors 
have been instructed to bring just one aide each to the table 
unlike a superpower summit or the annual economic parlay of 
america and its allies the virginia meeting will not be propelled 
by legions of stripedpants aides toiling behind the scenes to agree 
on accords in advance for the political leaders to ratify 
bush appears intent on hearing firsthand testimony from the 
governors many of them veterans of battles over school reform in 
their states on which ideas hold the most promise 
bush has already indicated his interest in hearing success 
stories on how to recruit and keep teachers how to keep drugs and 
crime out of schools and how to give parents more choice over which 
public school their child attends 
eventually the president will propose new education goals for 
the nation not at the end of this summit but at a later date 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush like ronald reagan before him has been an enthusiastic 
backer of efforts in minnesota and elsewhere to give parents more 
choice in public education the rationale is that public schools 
will be put on their mettle if forced to compete for students 
instead of relying on a neighborhood monopoly 
bush also backs expanded aid for magnet schools which strive for 
excellence through academic specialties 
the president has lauded new jerseys successful experiment with 
an alternative certification program that allows noneducation 
majors into the teaching profession 
virtually every state has raised graduation standards since the 
scorching 1983 report a nation at risk written by a reagan 
administration panel and teacher salaries have spurted ahead faster 
than inflation 
but american pupils still lag behind their counterparts in other 
industrialized nations on virtually every international study 
scores have stagnated on college entrance tests 
americaa schools are beset with drug and dropout problems 
unheard of in japan which graduates nearly all of its teenagers 
from high school 
bush in a public television documentary last spring said he 
viewed the three most pressing problems facing americas schools as 
drugs drugs and drugs 
the federal budget deficit makes it difficult for bush to promise 
major resources to carry out education initiatives 
he sent congress on april 5 a modest 441 million package of 
proposed additions to the education departments nearly 22 billion 
budget 
more than half the requested money 250 million would go to 
create a presidential merit schools awards program providing cash 
grants to top schools in addition 100 million would be earmarked 
for magnet schools 
the proposal has made little headway on capitol hill although 
the house last week passed a small component scholarships for math 
and science majors who become teachers 
cavazos says the charlottesville summit is just the beginning 
of bushs efforts to begin a national dialogue on education 
but after six years of school reform and literally scores of 
reports ruminating on what is wrong with americas schools many 
educators are impatient for results 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
warns it will be a terrible letdown and a waste if the summit 
deals with trivialities if symbolism is all the president has 
in mind and the education summit turns out to be just another media 
event

the trade imbalance between the united 
states and japan is caused by the difference in attractiveness 
of the nations goods not price the chairman of sony corp told 
world business executives 
the answer does not lie in protection for hightech 
industries akio morita said monday protectionism runs counter 
to free market principles and with the lack of external 
competition would only encourage inefficient industries which are 
unable to market their products outside of their protected market 
the real key to competitiveness he said lies not in trade 
policy but in such areas as increasing investment strengthening 
commercial rampd and above all increasing the quality and spirit of 
the labor force 
akio speaking to 500 business leaders from 62 countries 
attending the international industrial conference said investments 
in improving industrial competitiveness must be viewed as a 
longterm proposition 
perhaps my most basic message is that both the us government 
and us corporations should shift their time horizons he said 
investments are needed today that will pay dividends in 10 20 or 
30 years 
morita also said international trade is now being shaken by 
emotional politicization of the trade imbalance 
i must say that the politicians and governments around the 
world are not sufficiently aware of the reality of an 
everdeveloping globalscale economy or a borderless economy he 
said the borderless economy has developed in such a speed and 
scale exceeding our foresight and imagination 
noting the foreign exchange involving billions of dollars yen 
and german marks he said imports and exports of tangible goods are 
not the only items that generate big money intellectual properties 
such as patents knowhow and music also are valuable he said 
in my view bilateral trade is made up of numerous buy and 
sell transactions between companies in the two nations an 
imbalance is the difference in the sum of these transactions over a 
given time 
it is important to americans and the world economy that us 
industry regain its competitiveness he said 
later jacques delors president of the commission of the 
european communities discussed the effort to remove trade barriers 
between european community nations by 1992 
delors said he saw no reason that the deadline for achieving a 
single market would not be reached despite difficulties in coming 
to agreement on the automotive transportation energy and 
telecommunications industries 
in those four fields the antagonisms between the nations are 
very destructive and the interests of firms and the interests of 
nations are mixed he said i must spend all my time to convince 
the 12 governments to fulfill the single market and to not accept 
exceptions because the advantage of a single market is enormous 
in those sectors 
delors provoked nervous laughter among the executives when he 
responded to a question about whether europeans would develop 
different trade policies for the united states and japan 
it depends on the japanese and the americans he said for 
example when i explain the process of reciprocity to american 
businessmen they understand they are very positive about the 
concept unfortunately when i explain this global concept to 
japanese it is more difficult to have an understanding 
and frankly we must be very tough with the negotiations with 
japan he said because it is very difficult for us our 
businesses our banks to penetrate the japanese market 
the remark drew scattered laughs and light applause from the 
audience which included dozens of japanese among them morita who 
chaired the proceedings and introduced delors 
excuse me but it is a matter of fact delors said to more 
nervous laughter 
when delors left the podium morita thanked him for his remarks 
and added i promise you to make japanese easier to understand

last weeks sharp selloff in the junk bond

more difficult for companies to take on much more of the highcost 
debt some analysts say 
by scaring off investors the plunge in junk bonds could make it 
nearly impossible for companies to sell new junk issues unless there 
is a strong likelihood they are able to make payments on it over the 
long run said john lonski senior economist for moodys investors 
service 
you cant continue to leverage forever there has to be some 
end to whats taking place and sooner is better than later 
lonski said monday 
issuers of junk bonds are highinterestrate debt securities 
often used by companies with poor credit ratings must pay high 
interest rates to attract investors in recent years the securities 
have been widely used for such ventures as mergers and acquisitions 
but if the economy sours issuers could be forced to default 
adding to the economys troubles 
quoted bids for junk bonds stabilized monday after last weeks 
selloff although analysts said trading in the most speculative 
issues nearly ground to a halt 
people feel its too late to sell and too early to buy said 
marshall b front an economist at the chicago investment firm of 
stein roe amp farnham 
a cash crunch at campeau corp the canadian retailing giant 
triggered last weeks price plunge carrying down even relatively 
secure issues olympia amp york developments ltd conditionally agreed 
friday to loan campeau 250 million in a deal that was expected to 
give the toronto developer greater influence over campeaus 
management and a greater ownership stake 
after being carried downward by campeaus problems the 
highergrade junk bonds such as stone container corp kroger co 
owenscorning fiberglas corp and harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
were quoted as much as point higher monday a point equals 10 on 
a bond with a face value of 1000 
meanwhile the bid on one issue of campeaus allied stores corp 
unit was quoted down slightly to 26 cents on the dollar from 27 but 
with bond owners not willing to offer the issue at less than 35 
cents there was virtually no trading market participants said 
the bid for campeaus federated department stores inc bonds rose 
10 to 55 but was still well below the asking price of 65 
companies that were planning to issue junk bonds in coming weeks 
might postpone or restructure their offerings because of the 
selloff which pushed up yields and made financing more expensive 
lonski said 
if wary investors demand higher and higher interest on junk 
bonds companies may be less able to rely on the lowgrade 
securities for financing they then may either pull back from 
speculative riskier ventures or finance them in a less risky way 
such as by issuing stock 
the economy is approaching the seventh birthday of the longest 
us peacetime expansion in history but some economists say it may 
not last much longer 
elliot janeway in a column in the new york times on sunday 
warned that dangerously high levels of inventories are accumulating 
in autos housing retailing and metals 
james buchan in a column in mondays editions of the 
londonbased financial times said the shakeout in junk bonds is the 
latest phase of a rolling liquidation that in past years had 
wrung speculation out of agriculture and the energy markets 
the secret is to shake out the speculators in batches not as 
in the 1920s all together buchan said 
james grant publisher of grants interest rate observer said he 
believed buchans assessment seemed on target its always good 
news when false values are exposed for being false he said in an

harbert corp on monday offered about 
385 million for birmingham steel a 5yearold company that 
prospered by buying older often financially troubled steel mills at 
bargain prices 
birmingham steel president james todd said the decision to sell 
the company to birminghambased harbert stemmed in part from a 
desire to keep its headquarters in birmingham 
we have had a number of people express an interest in buying 
out the company he said 
harbert corp offered 30 a share in cash or a total of about 
385 million for the companys stock harbert an international 
construction company also would assume and refinance more than 100 
million in birmingham steel debt 
the companys stock closed monday at 2912 up 450 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
birmingham steel had a profit of about 39 million in its latest 
fiscal year on sales of more than 343 million 
harbert corp was founded by john m harbert iii a major 
birmingham steel investor 
a special committee of outside directors formed by the company 
to study a possible sale recommended the harbert offer after 
determining there was little room for the stocks price to move 
above the low 20s 
the price has been depressed because of birmingham steels 50 
percent investment in redevelopment of a houston texas rolling 
mill which eventually will make flatrolled sheet steel 
harbert chairman of the company said birmingham steels success 
and strong management team prompted him to make the offer he 
already owns less than 5 percent of the companys stock and sits on 
its board of directors 
we are knowledgable about this industry he said 
the offer must be approved by birmingham steel stockholders

a rare datadestroying computer virus that will 
attack personal computers after oct 12 is causing consternation 
among computer owners who fear they will be among its relatively 
small number of victims 
computer security firms and companies that supply antiviral 
software say they have been deluged by calls since word of the 
datacrime virus was spread widely last week by the news media 
frankly the virus isnt all that important a virus yet this 
phone is ringing off the hook ross greenberg a new yorker who 
makes a virus protector called flushot plus said late last week 
the alarms that are going off absolutely staggered me said 
winn schwartau president of american computer security industries 
inc in nashville tenn he said several government agencies and 
fortune 500 companies had contacted him about the virus 
greenberg said he has received maybe a halfdozen reports of the 
virus since it surfaced earlier this year the computer virus 
industry association of santa clara calif has received seven 
reports chairman john mcafee said monday 
in contrast there have been thousands of reports of other 
viruses far more people will be hit on oct 13 by the less harmful 
but more widespread jerusalem virus also known as the plo or friday 
the 13th virus 
im more worried about spilling a cup of coffee on my keyboard 
than i am about the datacrime virus greenberg said 
computer viruses are pieces of software written by anonymous 
programmers that make copies of themselves and spread from one 
machine to another through infected floppy disks office networks or 
phone links such as computer bulletin boards 
the datacrime virus attacks the hard disk datastorage devices of 
ibmcompatible personal computers that use microsoft corps msdos 
operating system it wipes out the directory section making it 
impossible for the disks contents to be read 
the virus is triggered when an infected program is used anytime 
after the computers internal clock passes oct 12 the traditional 
date for columbus day it is also known as the columbus day or 
icelandic virus 
the virus was found lying dormant in computers by people who 
noticed that some of their programs had swollen inexplicably 
infected programs were turned over to experts who dismantled the 
virus and found out how it worked and when it would be triggered 
computer security experts say the best thing computer users can 
do to protect themselves from the datacrime or any other virus is to 
make backup copies every day of everything they want to save 
people should make backups the way they brush their teeth in 
the morning like a basic part of hygiene greenberg said 
users can limit their exposure to viruses by staying away from 
bootleg software while being cautious in their use of computer 
bulletin boards and networks but viruses have even been found in 
new storebought software in a few rare instances 
several companies make software that scans programs for known 
viruses but those scanners wont pick up viruses they dont 
recognize 
other programs stop a machine cold and alert the user when a 
program tries to do something unauthorized such as writing on an 
offlimits portion of the hard disk the latest versions allow users 
to teach them to give fewer false alarms which can be a major 
annoyance 
once an infected program is found the usual course is to erase 
it and write over it with zeroes so it cant be resurrected by a 
clever programmer some companies say they can delete a virus while 
saving the infected program while others say that approach is 
unreliable 
its absolutely impossible for anybody to say we have a fix for 
this said pamela kane president of panda systems of wilmington 
del 
pc magazine earlier this year gave its top ratings to greenbergs 
flushot plus a 10 program distributed through computer bulletin 
boards and certus from foundationware inc of cleveland which 
costs 189 
the small group of people making virus detection or eradication 
software also includes panda systems the computer virus industry 
association mcafees own interpath corp and raymond glaths rg 
software systems inc in willow grove pa

a federal judge has ordered the justice 
department to investigate whether the government has leaked 
confidential information to the press about its case against 
indicted financier michael milken 
but us district judge kimba wood said monday she would not hold 
a hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers until 
after milkens trial so as not to heighten publicity in the 
racketeering and fraud case 
milkens lawyers last week asked wood to order the government to 
halt a constant stream of press leaks they claimed threatened 
the right to a fair trial for the former head of drexel burnham 
lambert incs junk bond division 
were very pleased with the courts decision to direct an 
investigation into the alleged leaks milken attorney martin 
flumenbaum said 
wood who is presiding over the case directed the us 
attorneys office and the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility to examine the alleged leaks by 
government officials she also requested private periodic reports on 
the probe 
but wood also said there was no basis in the record for the 
contention that the alleged leaks could only have come from 
government sources 
milken was first named in news reports as the governments main 
target shortly after nowjailed speculator ivan boesky agreed to 
cooperate with the governments investigation of widespread wall 
street corruption in late 1986 boesky provided much of the 
information used to indict milken 
newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advance 
details of the governments investigation and indictment plans 
stories have appeared leading up to and containing the indictment 
date as well as the charges 
the motion cited stories published in the wall street journal 
the new york times the washington post and the los angeles times 
milkens lawyers asked wood to order the government to stop 
leaking confidential material hold a hearing to identify the 
sources of the leaks impose contempt sanctions on the leakers and 
make public a securities and exchange commission memo detailing 
confidential testimony in the case that recently was written about 
in the post 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said the government had 
requested an investigation of the alleged leaks which defense 
lawyers have protested regularly before the motion was filed last 
wednesday 
the judge also said the government should instruct the grand jury 
in the case not to pay attention to any outside reports on the case 
which prosecutors said they already had done 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were charged in march in a 98count fraud and racketeering 
indictment that alleges insider trading securities violations and 
other crimes they have pleaded innocent and a march 1990 trial is 
set

hertz corp says it is pulling out of airline 
frequentflier programs because the growth of mileage awards had 
made them too costly for the company 
other national carrental concerns indicated they might follow 
the industry leader 
but analysts said monday that while the withdrawal of carrental 
companies would make frequentflier programs less attractive it did 
not mean their demise 
anytime some feature of the program is eliminated it is less 
potent as a marketing tool said tom longman an analyst with bear 
stearns amp co but these programs are here to stay they will just 
evolve a bit more 
hertz the nations largest carrental company said the rate of 
growth of mileage points had doubled in each of the last two years 
the value of the redeemed credits last year exceeded 15 million 
said hertz spokeswoman brenda rigby 
the program has become very expensive to participate in ms 
rigby said double and triple mileage programs have become 
increasingly common in the last couple of years so the frequency of 
the awards has grown 
ms rigby said that because 60 percent of hertz customers are 
business travelers hertz feels it is giving incentives to people 
who likely would rent from the company anyway 
hertz based in park ridge nj said it would end its 
participation with delta air lines america west airlines eastern 
airlines and continental airlines at the end of the year 
frequent fliers on these carriers will have until dec 31 to earn 
mileage for hertz coupons and will have until the end of 1990 to use 
the coupons hertz said 
hertz also plans to discontinue partnerships with american 
airlines united airlines and usair as those contracts come up for 
renewal after dec 31 ms rigby said 
american airlines initiated the frequentflier program in 1981 in 
an effort to draw and keep customers other airlines soon followed 
hertz and other national car rental concerns as well as hotels 
joined with the airlines hoping to generate new business 
travelers in frequentflier programs earn credits for miles they 
fly nights they stay in hotels and each time they rent cars 
credits can be redeemed for free air travel hotel stays and car 
rentals 
but in recent years airlines have been cutting back on the 
programs because they were forced to give out too many free trips as 
the programs became popular hertz said it is having a similar 
problem in addition higher air fares this year have softened the 
carrental business analysts said 
avis inc said monday it is evaluating its own participation with 
frequent fliers in light of hertz move 
obviously theyre expensive said avis spokeswoman demetria 
mudar this sheds a different light on things an industry leader 
making a major move 
national car rental system inc said it also may have an 
announcement soon on its frequentflier participation 
were taking a hard look at the hertz move said michael j 
olsen spokesman for national car rental 
budget rent a car corp said it is not currently considering 
dropping its frequentflier partnerships 
the frequentflier program is very costly and by itself is not 
worth the cost said martin smircich president of budgets north 
american group but the airlines that we are participating with 
have been good to work for and our participation is not limited 
strictly to giving out mileage

despite the savings and loan crisis the thrift 
industry continues to be the largest originator of home mortgages a 
government study reported 
thrifts retain the lead with 43 percent of single family 
mortgages and 46 percent of multifamily mortgages according to the 
office of thrift supervision study released monday 
part of the thrift industry crisis was blamed on some savings and 
loans that engaged in risky investments such as speculative 
commercial real estate projects and junk bonds rather than home 
mortgages 
the recently enacted savings and loan law which authorized 
spending 50 billion to bail out the industry requires thrifts to 
raise the level of housing and housingrelated loans in their 
portfolios to 70 percent from the current 60 percent sampls have five 
years to phase out their risky ventures 
savings and loan companies were estimated to have held nearly 
780 billion in mortgages at the end of 1988 36 percent of the 2 
trillion home mortgage market and only 4 percent less than their 
1970 share the study said

ford motor co says it is recalling nearly 
493000 escorts and mercury lynxes to fix faulty emissioncontrol 
systems and 67156 tracers because of an apparent seatbelt defect 
repairs of either problem will be made at no charge regardless of 
a vehicles age or mileage ford and the environmental protection 
agency said monday in separate statements 
the vehicles recalled for emissionsystem improvements have 
19liter engines and include the 1985 ford escort and mercury lynx 
and the 1986 escort lynx and ford exp 
excessive emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were 
discovered during routine epa tests of 1985 models epa spokeswoman 
martha casey said 
were constantly checking various classes of vehicle to see if 
a few years after leaving the assembly line theyre still meeting 
standards casey said 
the epa didnt request the ford recall but we sort of term 
these recalls epainfluenced casey said 
ford spokesman mike parris in michigan attributed the problem to 
normal wear 
a few years back the equipment was not as good as it was 
now parris said some of the valves and small hoses and pieces 
are starting to wear out and were having to replace them with 
upgraded pieces 
the ford repairs will involve changing the choke system 
distributor spark advance and the airinjection system a 
pollutioncontrol system that helps the catalytic converter control 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide dealers also will install more 
durable crankcase ventilation valves also known as pcv valves epa 
said 
cars made for sale in california are excluded from the ford 
recall because they are manufactured to meet that states emission 
standards which are more stringent than epas parris said 
no california cars have been found to fall short of the federal 
standards casey said 
the tracers being recalled were made in the 1988 model year 
there are 66314 in the united states and 842 in canada ford said 
in some cases it has become difficult to extend the frontseat 
lapshoulder belts for buckling unless they are pulled very slowly 
the company said a few of the belts may lock and be impossible to 
pull out 
owners having trouble extending the belts are asked to return the 
car to the dealer for inspection and repairs if necessary the

macmillan inc the publishing giant controlled 
by britains robert maxwell has agreed to buy the textbook concern 
merrill publishing for 260 million in cash 
the deal would swell macmillans share of the educational 
publishing market while enabling merrills owner the 
privatelyheld bell amp howell co to make a graceful retreat from 
that fiercely competitive business 
merrill publishing based in columbus ohio publishes textbooks 
software and other learning materials for the elementary high 
school and college markets and officials said it was expected to 
post more than 100 million in revenue this year 
the company founded in 1842 has been owned since 1967 by bell amp 
howell which is based in skokie ill 
jerry herb vice presidentadministration at bell amp howell said 
his company decided to sell merrill publishing for strategic reasons 
he said consolidation in the educational publishing field put 
merrill at a competitive disadvantage with larger companies he said 
bell amp howell considered making some acquisitions in this field but 
found few potential candidates and decided several months ago to 
sell merrill 
the deal is subject to regulatory approval 
we are extremely pleased to acquire this excellent publisher 
maxwell was quoted as saying in a twosentence announcement of the 
deal 
maxwell had told shareholders of maxwell communication corp plc 
last week at their annual meeting in london that the company was 
negotiating for a mediumsized educational publishing business in 
north america 
bell amp howell was acquired in may 1988 for 640 million by a 
group led by texas investor robert m bass and including senior 
management before that deal was completed maxwell had indicated he 
was interested in pursuing bell amp howell but never made a formal 
offer 
maxwell subsequently paid 25 billion for macmillan which is a 
leading educational publisher and has a growing information services 
business 
earlier this year macmillan combined its elementary secondary 
and vocational education publishing businesses with those of 
mcgrawhill inc in a 5050 joint venture called the 
macmillanmcgrawhill school publishing co 
macmillan continues to operate its own college textbook 
publishing business separately 
buzz ellis president of the school division at merrill said 
merrill expects to post more than 100 million in revenue this year 
and employs about 650 people at three sites in the columbus 
metropolitan area 
the news release did not say how the merrill operations would be 
combined with those of macmillan and company spokeswoman suzanne 
cummings said she did now know what the plans were 
but if merrills elementary and secondary school operations were 
combined with those of the macmillanmcgrawhill joint venture it 
would become the nations second largest publisher for elementary 
and secondary schools according to educational marketer a trade 
newsletter from knowledge industry publications inc of white 
plains ny 
educational marketer estimated that merrill derived 70 million 
in revenue from elementary and secondary school publishing in 1988 
that would lift the macmillanmcgrawhill total for 1988 to 440 
million second only to 4765 million at harcourt brace jovanovich 
inc 
in the nations college publishing rankings macmillan ranks 10th 
at 583 million and the addition of merrills estimated 20 million 
to 25 million in 1988 revenue would leave the combined operation 
far behind the leader simon amp schuster at 2182 million in 1988 
according to educational marketer 
herb said the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce part 
of bell amp howells debt of about 500 million and to finance 
internal growth of its remaining businesses which include 
republishing databases and a mail handling operation

brazil plans to ask the international monetary 
fund for a 90day extension on payments to service its 110 billion 
debt because it cannot meet its obligations a highranking official 
of the countrys central bank was quoted as saying 
the mexican government news agency quoted wadico waldir bucchi a 
governor of the brazilian central bank as saying president jose 
sarneys administration is seeking to gain time in order to receive 
a 600 loan still pending from the imf which will be used to service 
the debt 
bucchi said the loan is part of a creditline the imf extended 
last year but which brazil has not received yet brazil cannot pay 
its creditors until it gets it 
bucchi was quoted by notimex as saying he is sure the imf will 
grant the 90day extension when he meets friday with officials of 
that organization in new york 
brazil is certain the great majority of creditor banks will 
respond positively to its petition bucchi said 
notimex said that bucchi spoke with reporters in the caribbean 
resort of cancun mexico where the heads of central banks from 
latin america spain and the philippines began meeting to discuss 
international strategies to deal with the imf and the world bank 
latin america alone owes an estimated 104 trillion and brazil 
has the biggest foreign debt in the third world followed by mexico 
with 1074 billion 
the meeting began in a climate of tension caused by rumors that 
brazil may declare a moratorium on 16 billion in interest payments 
that came due last friday 
however sergio amaral adviser on international relations in 
brazils treasury ministry said those reports were wrong 
its not true amaral told the associated press in a 
telephone interview we are going to look for a solution quickly 
to reach an agreement with banks 
amaral would not elaborate on brazils plans 
brazil has previously suspended payments and according to news 
reports in brazil such a moratorium would help the south american 
giant maintain its reserves of 6 billion but would hurt its chances 
of obtaining fresh money from international lenders 
it is our own political economic mistakes that have determined 
that development in latin america is lagging behind the rest of the 
world said miguel mancera aguayo director of mexicos central 
bank at the opening of mondays meetings 
mancera said that business activity increased 50 percent over the 
past 10 years in latin america but has not kept pace with 
industrial nations because the powerful nations have closed their 
markets and paid less for prime materials they import according 
to the independent excelsior news agency 
he said latin american nations should find their own solutions 
and not wait for outside answers because there have been failures 
in the management of the political economy that have aggravated the 
problems

sears roebuck and co has plenty of time to sell 
its towering headquarters building analysts say if it sells it at 
all 
a nosale option reportedly is under consideration by the 
nations largest retailer since its prospective sale of sears tower 
to a canadian developer got sidetracked last week 
sears declined to comment monday on the report in this weeks 
crains chicago business which did not identify its sources for the 
story 
one option being considered according to crains was a 
refinancing plan that would amount to a new mortgage on the property 
among sears watchers the item was received as one more rumor 
swirling in the wind around the worlds tallest building 
im convinced the tower is to be sold said walter loeb a 
retail analyst who follows sears for morgan stanley amp co in new 
york but he added i think it may be sitting on the shelf a 
while longer 
retailing analysts said sears investment value would not suffer 
if the tower were not sold by years end as the company had planned 
but sears had planned to use proceeds from the sale to pay off 
the money it borrowed for its stock repurchase program 
and reducing its debt reported by sears as 2 billion in a july 
31 filing with the securities and exchange commission remains a 
powerful incentive for sears to sell its tower loeb said 
some observers believe sears could still end up selling the 
110story 1707foot landmark to olympia amp york developments inc 
the torontobased company that until last week appeared ready to 
buy sears tower for a widely reported 104 billion 
the prospective sale got stalled in a dispute over which party 
should shoulder a steep increase in property taxes likely to result 
from a postsale reassessment 
olympia amp york declined to comment on the tower sale or on 
whether the firm was backing out in order to devote more resources 
to bankrolling the cashstarved canadian retailer campeau corp 
olympia amp york conditionally agreed friday to loan campeau 250 
million in a deal that was expected to give the toronto developer 
greater influence over campeaus management and a greater ownership 
stake 
sears announced last october it would sell the tower as part of a 
restructuring plan that included an everyday lowprice retailing 
policy the transfer of its retailing division headquarters from the 
tower to suburban hoffman estates in the early 1990s and a buyback 
of 40 million shares or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock 
olympia amp york emerged as the leading bidder in july but the 
negotiations were rocky sears apparently insisted its name remain 
on the building after the sale and the canadians reportedly had 
trouble finding a large tenant to anchor the 2 million square feet 
of office space sears is vacating in the 15yearold building 
britishbased publisher maxwell communications corp was said to 
have been interested in consolidating its chicago operations in 
sears tower but is now considering other quarters including a 
125story skyscraper proposed by local developers miglinbeitler 
developments inc that would be taller than the sears tower 
we submitted a bid to maxwell on friday said 
miglinbeitler spokesman mark jarasek

consumer inflation turned in its best 
performance in more than three years in august as prices remained 
frozen at the previous months level the government reported today 
it was the first time that the labor departments consumer price 
index has not registered an increase since april 1986 when it fell 
by 03 percent the august performance was credited to a 42 percent 
plunge in gasoline prices the steepest onemonth drop in three 
years 
falling energy prices have given consumers three consecutive 
months of good news on inflation prices were up a modest 02 
percent in both june and july 
this was in sharp contrast to the situation earlier in 1989 when 
steep hikes in gasoline and food led to a surge in prices pushed the 
inflation rate up to an annual level of 67 percent for the first 
five months of the year 
but with the price moderation in the three months since then 
consumer prices are now rising at a more modest annual rate of 48 
percent up only slightly from the 44 percent increase for all of 
1988 
in another economic report meantime the commerce department 
said housing construction fell 5 percent in august for the largest 
decline in six months new homes and apartments were built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 135 million units down from 
142 million units in july 
while some economists say the country is in for moderation in 
inflation other analysts are worried that underlying inflationary 
pressures are being masked by the plunge in energy costs 
these economists say energy prices which surged early in the 
year only to fall back somewhat in the past three months are likely 
to begin rising again this fall reflecting higher crude oil costs 
gasoline prices shot up 212 percent in the first five months of 
the year then fell 1 percent in june 22 percent in july and 42 
percent in august the august decline was the biggest drop since a 
52 percent decrease in august 1986 
natural gas and electricity prices registered a 02 percent 
decline while heating oil costs fell by 09 percent last month 
food prices rose a modest 02 percent in august following a 03 
percent july gain those figures were in sharp contrast to the first 
nine months of the year when the lingering effects of the 1988 
drought sent food costs racing ahead at a 93 percent annual rate 
for august declines in the cost of pork and poultry were 
partially offset by increases for beef fish and eggs 
fruit and vegetable prices fell 02 percent in august following a 
05 percent increase in july 
clothing costs fell a sharp 15 percent in august helping to 
push apparel prices down by 34 percent over the past three months 
the price drop was credited to larger than normal endofseason 
price cuts for womens and girls clothing 
the various changes left the overall consumer price index at 
1246 in august meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods 
costing 100 in the base period of 198284 would have cost 12460 
last month 
the price of goods and services other than food and energy rose 
02 percent in august after climbing by 04 percent in july it is 
this underlying inflation rate that has some analysts concerned that 
the battle against rising prices has not been won 
the us inflation rate is not as good as it looks said 
david wyss an economist at drimcgraw hill an economic consulting 
firm in lexington mass 
we are seeing a slow acceleration of inflation but for the next 
few months that will be hidden by soft energy and food prices he 
said 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm agreed with 
this assessment saying the big plunge in gasoline prices is coming 
to an end reflecting the rise in crude oil prices in recent weeks 
gasoline prices will not fall any further while prices other 
than food and energy will continue to rise on a broad front evans 
said 
still analysts believe the inflation rate for all of 1989 will 
not be too much worse than in 1988 when consumer prices rose 44 
percent 
the bush administration is projecting that consumer prices will 
rise 5 percent for all of 1989 a forecast that is generally in 
line with most private economists 
the federal reserve is a bit less optimistic saying it was 
looking for an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 55 percent 
this year 
many economists believe the fed is unlikely to ease up on credit 
anytime soon in spite of the recent good news on inflation because 
of its more pessimistic assumptions about underlying inflationary 
pressures

at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 135 million units down 
from 142 million units in july starts had gained 13 percent in 
july and 75 percent in june 
the august drop was the largest since a127 percent fall last 
february 
it was the first decline since may for the housing industry 
which had been among the sectors hardest hit earlier this year as 
the federal reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth 
and control inflation 
fixed mortgage rates which peaked at 1122 percent in march had 
fallen to 968 percent by aug 4 according to the federal home loan 
mortgage co they stood at 1005 percent last week 
construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight 
months before rebounding in june the longest string of declines 
since activity slowed for five months in a row from february through 
june 1987 the may level of 131 million starts was the slowest pace 
since the 130 million rate in december 1982 
but despite the rebound the federal national mortgage 
association better known as fannie mae said singlefamily starts 
at the end of july were running about 39 percent below their 
average for 1988 
total housing starts during the first eight months of the year 
are down 47 percent from the same period of 1988 
in addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building 
materials industries the housing industry also has an impact on 
other housingrelated businesses such as home furnishings and 
appliances 
construction of singlefamily homes last month fell 25 percent 
to an annual rate of 1 million units singlefamily starts had risen 
59 percent in july after falling 05 percent in june

rate of 350000 units it had fallen 9 percent in july after rising 
311 percent in june 
the northeast suffered the largest percentage decline down 282 
percent to 140000 units at an annual rate it was the largest drop 
in the region since a 29 percent decline in march and the lowest 
number of starts since 128000 units in december 1982 
the midwest suffered a 97 percent decline to 241000 units and 
the west declined 74 percent to 398000 units 
only the south registered a gain up 79 percent to 574000 units

international business machines corp today 
announced a system for writing computer programs with the help of 
computer programs 
the worlds biggest computer company held a news conference to 
announce its commitment to computeraided software engineering 
which is intended to make software more reliable and faster to 
develop 
more than 30 companies expressed their support for ibms 
blueprint another demonstration of ibms influence in the 
largecomputer business 
disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling 
patchedtogether unmanageable programs that take up valuable 
programmers time and stall innovation the problem has become so 
acute that corporate chief executives are pressing their computer 
chiefs for a solution 
the real driving force behind our industry is that we have got 
to figure out how to build better software faster kim addington 
vice president for marketing at knowledgeware inc in atlanta said 
monday in advance of the announcement 
sales of tools for computeraided software engineering already 
total about 300 million a year even though fewer than 10 percent 
of customers are even dabbling in it according to case research 
corp of bellevue wash 
case research expects sales to start jumping about a year from 
now when software toolmakers have brought their products into line 
with ibms de facto industry standard 
at least five years will be required to achieve largely automatic 
programming but ibms commitment at least legitimizes the concept 
of it consultants say 
this is the holy grail the software industry is committing 
itself to the ibm platform they dont have to be cajoled into that 
theyre doing it readily because they see the value of the rules 
being established sam albert a consultant in scarsdale ny 
and former ibm software executive said in an interview monday 
ibm said it will come out next june with a repository a 
library containing the information that all the different software 
engineering tools need to do their jobs strict rules will ensure 
that all toolmakers structure their information in a consistent way 
the tools will help programmers at every stage from the analysis 
of a business problem to the overall design of a software solution 
to the automatic generation and testing of code that actually 
carries out the job 
ibm said programs developed with its socalled adcycle system 
would all have the same look and feel making them easier for users 
to learn how to use 
we believe our announcement today is an important event for 
this world that runs on software george conrades an ibm senior 
vice president said in a prepared statement 
he said programmers speed has lagged far behind the speed of the 
computers themselves 
it doesnt make sense for computers to process hundreds of 
millions of instructions per second while programmers process just 
10 instructions per day conrades said 
by automating software toolmakers hope to keep programmers 
hands off of the actual code so they deal only with the higherlevel 
problems of analysis and design 
a lot of research has shown that 60 to 70 percent of the 
problems in systems are in the analysis and design so lets put our 
money where our problems are greg boone president of case 
research said monday 
the unusual amount of cooperation with other software developers 
some of which sell rival products reflects ibms strategy of 
forming partnerships instead of trying to do everything itself 
by making it easier to write programs for ibm computers ibm 
hopes to sell more machines to existing customers and possibly 
attract new customers albert said 
unisys corp has promoted computeraided software engineering for 
several years but has a much smaller share of the big computer 
market than ibm igital equipment corp has an uncertain strategy in 
the field cases boone said 
hewlettpackard in contrast is sort of the quiet giant in 
computeraided software engineering boone said the difference is 
that hewlettpackard is focusing on aerospace and defense 
electronics while ibms major thrust is in the larger commercial 
market 
knowledgeware bachman information systems inc and index 
technology corp will be three of ibms principal partners in 
computeraided software engineering

manufacturers hanover corp says it expects a 
huge loss after a restructuring that includes the addition of 950 
million to its loanloss reserves a newstock issue and the sale of 
60 percent of its cit group financial services unit to daiichi 
kangyo bank ltd of japan 
but the bank holding company which made the announcement late 
monday said its plan should significantly improve its capital and 
reserve position 
we view this as a very positive endeavor for manufacturers 
hanover chairman john f mcgillicuddy told reporters at a news 
conference 
manufacturers hanover the nations seventh largest bank 
estimated it would suffer a loss of about 775 million for the third 
quarter and 475 million for all of 1989 
for the first six months of this year manufacturers hanovers 
profit was down 62 pecent to 209 million or 370 a share from 
the yearearlier period the 1988 period included about 388 million 
in onetime gains from divestitures and tax benefits 
manufacturers hanover said daiichi kangyo the worlds largest 
bank with assets of 410 billion agreed to pay 128 billion for 
the 60 percent stake in cit the transaction is the largest purchase 
of a us company by a japanese bank 
yuko oana a senior managing director of daiichi said today 
that the investment in cit allows his bank to offer more services 
globally and to expand its customer base to include more mediumsize 
companies in the united states 
cit with its comprehensive range of assetbacked financing 
products will enable us to offer a considerably broader product 
line to our customers around the world oana told a news 
conference 
at the same time we believe that cit will benefit from the 
international exposure and perspective that dkb can provide 
mondays announcements came after the stock market closed in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange manufacturers 
hanover closed up 87 cents at 4175 a share monday in 
latemorning trading today its shares rose 1 to 4275 
analysts said they werent surprised by the moves manufacturers 
hanover had been coming under increasing pressure to raise capital 
and increase reserves for losses on loans to lessdeveloped 
countries 
the addition of 950 million in loanloss provisions in the third 
quarter boosts manufacturers hanovers loanloss reserve to 24 
billion or 36 percent of its portfolio of medium to longterm 
loans up from reserves of 15 billion or 22 percent of its loans 
on average other big money center banks have reserves equal to 
about 30 percent of their loans to lessdeveloped countries 
this should take some of the sting of ldc exposure away from 
manufacturers hanover and give it some room to maneuver said james 
j mcdermott jr an analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods in new 
york i think it was a necessary step 
mcgillicuddy said recent debt negotiations with mexico and the 
us governments plan for reducing the 13 trillion third world 
debt known as the brady plan could make it harder for banks to 
collect on outstanding loans 
manufacturers hanover said it would issue up to 500 million in 
new common stock before years end analysts said the stock sale 
coupled with the sale of a controlling stake in cit should provide 
the bank with muchneeded capital to handle its third world debt 
problem 
cit is the biggest bankaffiliated finance company in the united 
states withassets of 97 billion and 120 million in earnings last 
year it provides loans and leases to mediumsized companies through 
50 offices nationwide manufacturers hanover acquired the business 
from rca corp in 1984 for 15 billion 
the deal also includes a private placement with daiichi of 27 
million in newly issued common shares of manufacturers hanover at 
45 a share for a total of 120 million daiichi promised not to 
acquire more than that 49 percent stake over a 10year period 
the sale of cit to daiichi which had been rumored for days is 
the latest in a series of divestitures in which manufacturers 
hanover has raised cash to bolster its capital last year it earned 
about 400 million from the sale of assets

a california dialaporn company whose 
sexuallyoriented messages were called repeatedly by a 16yearold 
boy will have to pay a 600000 fine under a federal communications 
commission order 
the commission in affirming a 1988 preliminary ruling against 
intercambio of san jose calif said monday the company had not 
prevented minors from listening to the adult material and had not 
prevented interstate telephone calls 
the commissions investigation found the evidence conclusive 
that intercambios messages were obscene and that it had in fact 
operated and was continuing to operate in violation of the law 
the fcc said 
interstate dialaporn calls to minors are banned under federal 
law 
the commission gave intercambio 30 days to pay the fine or face 
criminal action 
the fcc said the complaint that prompted the investigation came 
in 1987 from a woman who said her 16yearold son was dialing the 
phone service 
according to a commission report the mother said her son placed 
more than 280 calls to various dialaporn numbers during a 2month 
period and was seeing a psychiatrist the commission said the boy 
listened to intercambios messages six times between july and 
september 1987 
in its defense the company told the fcc its service was intended 
only for california and it had attempted to restrict access to 
minors the company also said the law and fcc rules on pornographic 
phone messages were unconstitutional 
but it did not provide evidence to back up its claims according 
to commissioner patricia diaz dennis 
there was no phone number listed for intercambio in san jose and 
attempts to locate a number for intercambios president dan 
glassoff were unsuccessful monday 
congress last year attempted to wipe out the dialaporn industry 
by outlawing the sale of indecent phone messages but the supreme 
court in june said only obscene material patently offensive 
sexual and without redeeming value may be banned 
congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents who 
incurred heavy phone bills from children dialing the 976 numbers 
associated with sexuallyoriented material 
but the supreme court said recent technological advances assured 
children could be kept out the reach of dialaporn services and the 
government had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults 
the 600000 fine was the same as one the fcc assessed another 
california company last year for transmitting obscene phone 
messages but mary beth hess chief of the fccs enforcement 
division said monday that audio enterprises of mill valley calif 
paid a 50000 fine and agreed to stop selling sexual phone messages 
while admitting no liability 
a third company 2001 enterprises of reseda calif has also 
agreed to stop its sexuallyoriented message business after paying 
the government 25000 hess said

cosmetics maker avon products inc pursued 
earlier this year by several unwanted suitors tuesday disclosed it 
has lowered 1989 income expectations due to weakening sales and a 
strong dollar 
this years aftertax earnings per share are now forecast at 
about 195 to 215 down from an earlier estimated range of 230 
to 240 earnings in 1990 will be an unspecified amount below the 
previously projected 335 to 345 a share avon said 
last year avon lost 4045 million or 679 a share reflecting 
a loss from discontinued operations 
in the united states our new products but especially our new 
gifts and jewelry products are falling behind sales expectations 
said james e preston avons chairman and chief executive officer 
in the fourth quarter noncosmetic products account for about 
50 percent of sales so that a shortfall in these categories has a 
disproportionate impact on the companys performance preston said 
in a news release 
the dollars strength is contributing materially to the 
shortfall preston said 
the beauty products manufacturer has been under pressure to 
enhance profitability in the aftermath of unsolicited takeover 
proposals that avons board rejected 
avon over the summer received a 41ashare or 285 billion 
takeover bid from investor irwin jacobs the jacobs offer topped an 
earlier proposal from avons rival direct seller amway corp which 
had proposed acquiring avon for 39 a share or about 21 billion 
avon also shunned takeover advances from mary kay corp parent 
of the doortodoor cosmetics company 
under preston avons management repeatedly has said the company 
is better off remaining independent free to carry out plans aimed 
at improving the balance sheet 
preston said tuesday that avon still is committed to the strategy 
outlined at a meeting with financial analysts may 19 and that the 
company is achieving many elements of the strategy 
avon recently said it is considering the sale of its retail 
fragrance subsidiaries giorgio beverly hills and parfums stern 
preston said the revised earnings projections dont include the 
effect of a potential sale of the perfume businesses

surgeon general c everett koop today denounced 
efforts to export us cigarettes as the height of hypocrisy 
koop who is retiring oct 1 testified at a hearing of the us 
trade representative against a request by the cigarette industry for 
government intervention to force thailand to allow sales and 
advertising of american cigarettes 
when we are persuading foreign governments to stop the flow of 
cocaine it is the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco said 
koop who has conducted a vigorous antismoking campaign throughout 
his tenure 
the us cigarette export association has requested the 
intervention and the trade representative is to decide the issue by 
next may 
in 1988 us tobacco exports contributed a record 35 billion 
to helping reduce this countrys onerous trade deficit said 
export association president owen smith 
people throughout asia will continue to buy and smoke billions 
of cigarettes each year with or without us presence in the 
marketplace said rep robin tallon dsc the real issue is 
whether american companies will be allowed to compete or if the 
playing field will be abandoned to other foreign manufacturers and 
local monopolies 
but rep chester a atkins dmass said the real issue is 
about the american government using leverage and tax dollars to 
coerce countries into allowing marketing practices that were 
outlawed long ago in the united states 
the petition seeks to force thailand to overturn a policy of 
banning cigarette advertisements in print and broadcast media 
atkins said 
the export association represents three major cigarette 
companies brown and williamson philip morris and rj reynolds 
since 1986 japan south korea and taiwan have opened markets to 
us cigarette brands after being accused of unfair trade and 
threatened with retaliation against their products 
i believe that most americans would be appalled to learn that 
their government which banned cigarette advertisements on tv 
required warning labels on cigarettes is aggressively pushing 
cigarette addiction overseas through the trade representative 
atkins said 
it is simply inexcusable for the us to exert its great 
influence to force thailand to reverse its health policy he said 
atkins is sponsoring legislation to require that us cigarette 
brands sold abroad carry warnings and advertising restrictions 
equivalent to those in the united states 
the industry argues that foreign countries are competent to make 
their own regulations

financially crippled campeau corp today secured 
an emergency loan that will enable its department stores to pay 
debts but force the companys founder robert campeau to relinquish 
control 
campeaus problems caused largely by obligations on its junk 
bond debts had raised doubts about the future of his company and 
injected uncertainty into the 200 billion market in junk bonds 
which are highyield highrisk securities used to finance takeovers 
and expansion 
olympia amp york developments ltd which is providing the 250 
million loan also obtained the power to steer campeau through a 
major financial overhaul 
olympia amp york owned by torontos reichmann brothers will be 
given three seats on a new 10member campeau board and the right to 
buy almost 16 million shares of the canadian retail and property 
holding company 
the first portion of the loan from olympia amp york became 
available immediately campeau said in an announcement released by 
its toronto headquarters 
the agreement calls for up to 150 million to be channeled to 
campeaus federated department stores inc and the remainder to its 
allied stores corp division 
the money will allow the department store operators to meet 
interest payments now due on debts and to pay suppliers shipping 
merchandise ahead of the crucial christmas shopping season 
under the definitive agreement with olympia amp york a new board 
of directors was appointed the configuration of the board reflects 
the amount of power that chairman robert campeau relinguished in the 
company he built 
three members of the new board come from the campeau group three 
from olympia amp york and four represent minority shareholders 
the board formed a restructuring committee headed by one of the 
three reichmannappointed members of the board lionel dodd the 
committee intends to hire the investment banking firm merrill lynch 
amp co to help develop a restructuring plan and retail business 
consultants from mckinsey amp co also will be engaged 
robert campeau who retained the titles of chairman and chief 
executive officer said the companys us arm will employ a chief 
executive officer and chief financial officer whose main mission 
will be to supervise the restructuring of campeaus retail 
operations in the united states 
the two new executives who have yet to be selected will report 
directly to the board and the restructuring committee 
part of the restructuring includes the sale of the 17store 
bloomingdales chain which is part of federated 
olympia amp york will use its best efforts to arrange temporary 
financing of about 800 million until campeau can arrange for the 
sale of new yorkbased bloomingdales olympia amp york has agreed to 
put up some of the bridge loan if necessary 
for coming to campeaus rescue olympia amp york will receive 
warrants entitling it to purchase up to 15625 million ordinary 
campeau shares at 16 a piece until sept 18 1991 
added to its current 245 percent stake in campeau the purchase 
of 16 million additional shares would raise olympia amp yorks 
interest in campeau to 384 percent on a fully diluted basis 
robert campeaus stake would be cut to 432 percent from about 54 
percent under the agreement 
campeau common stock last traded at 1350 canadian dollars 
before it was halted last wednesday after trading as high as 2225 
a few days earlier 
commenting on the deal with olympia amp york robert campeau said 
after reviewing projected cash flow requirements and the financial 
position of campeau and its subsidiaries he determined that a major 
restructuring was needed to reduce leverage 
at my request olympia amp york has agreed to substantially 
increase its investment in campeau and to be primarily responsible 
for the refinancing and restructuring campeau said the 
significant experience and expertise of the olympia amp york 
organization will greatly assist in the endeavor

housing construction depressed by a spike in 
mortgage rates fell by 5 percent in august the government said 
tuesday in a report many analysts viewed as only a temporary setback 
for the housing industry 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 135 million units last 
month down from 142 million units in july 
it was the first decline since may and the largest setback since 
a 127 percent fall last february housing starts had risen 13 
percent in july and 75 percent in june 
fixed mortgage rates which peaked at 1122 percent in march had 
fallen to 968 percent by aug 4 but then rose by about onehalf 
percentage point through august 
however in recent weeks they have begun edging down slightly 
now standing at 1005 percent according to the weekly survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp economists predicted continued 
small declines in mortgage rates for the rest of the year and said 
this should bolster sales and construction figures 
the august housing starts numbers show builders were waiting 
out the recent uptick in interest rates said john tuccillo chief 
economist of the national association of realtors however the 
higher rate of building permits is a good sign that the stalled 
activity in august is only temporary 
overall applications for building permits considered a good 
barometer of future activity rose 35 percent after falling 21 
percent in july 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said the drop in construction and another report 
tuesday showing consumer prices did not rise in august should 
convince the federal reserve to stop fighting inflation and resume 
lowering interest rates to bolster the economy 
however other economists said they doubted that the weak 
construction number would prompt action on the part of the fed 
given the fact that other statistics show the economy is continuing 
to grow at a healthy rate 
i dont think the fed will do anything to change policy for the 
next several months said david berson chief economist of the 
federal national mortgage association 
richard peach senior economist at the mortgage bankers 
association said he believed that interest rates will fall despite 
fed intervention as financial market fears about inflation ease 
construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight 
months before rebounding in june the longest string of declines 
since activity slowed for five months in a row from february through 
june 1987 the may level of 131 million starts was the slowest pace 
since the 130 million rate in december 1982 
total housing starts during the first eight months of the year 
are down 47 percent from the same period of 1988 
construction of singlefamily homes last month fell 25 percent 
to an annual rate of 1 million units singlefamily starts had risen 
59 percent in july after falling 05 percent in june 
apartment construction fell 114 percent in august to an annual 
rate of 350000 units it had fallen 9 percent in july after rising 
311 percent in june

international business machines corp said 
tuesday it would make 20000 experts available worldwide to help its 
customers adapt to the coming era of software engineering 
the statement came as ibm announced as expected that it was 
committing itself to computeraided software engineering or case 
ibms endorsement is expected to give a large boost to the hightech 
field which already garners about 300 million in annual revenue 
software engineering is intended to replace disorganized methods 
of softwarewriting that have led to chaotic unmanageable and 
failureprone programs for large computers 
consultants said ibms promise of experts to help customers was 
an important part of the announcement since the transition to 
software engineering promises to be a real test of programmers 
flexibility 
the limiting factor on the introduction of case technology is 
the ability of information systems shops to cope with a radically 
new culture it is going to take them quite some years said ian 
palmer chairman of james martin associates in reston va 
its going to require an investment not just of the companys 
time but of a persons ability to recycle themselves reengineer 
themselves said dick welsh the dallasbased director of 
information systems consulting markets for ernst amp young 
some of the 20000 experts will come from ibm and some from four 
outside firms designated by ibm cap gemini america computer power 
group computer task group and ge consulting 
ibm is calling its offering adcycle its strategy relies heavily 
on existing softwaredevelopment tools marketed by other companies 
that beat ibm to the market particularly knowledgeware inc 
bachman information systems inc and index technology inc 
more than 30 companies on tuesday announced their support for 
ibms plan which will roll out over the next several years 
this may be the farthest ibm has ever gone in using other 
companies products as a central part of its own strategy said 
george conrades an ibm senior vice president its a highwater 
mark but its an everrising tide he said in an interview

walt disney world co is challenging a 254 
percent property tax increase county officials say was levied to 
help pay for huge commercial growth and traffic problems near the 
tourist attraction 
disney on monday paid osceola county 12000 the companys own 
estimate of 1989 property taxes owed the county plans to bill 
disney for 14 million 
disney spokesman charlie ridgway said tuesday the company filed a 
lawsuit in state circuit court to protect our rights to challenge 
although we hope to come to an agreement with county authorities on 
the whole subject 
osceola removed the agricultural classification on most of 
disneys undeveloped property in the county and jacked up the tax 
bill to 14 million disneys theme park is located north of the 
area in orlando in orange county 
disney filed the lawsuit friday to beat a monday deadline on 
challenges to tax assessments 
a disney representative on monday dropped off checks totaling 
12012 the companys goodfaith estimate of its 1989 taxes 
its kind of like theyre thumbing their nose at us isnt 
it osceola property appraiser bob day said i mean 12000 vs 
14 million theres a big difference there wouldnt you say 
until this year much of disneys 7013 acres of undeveloped 
property was classified as agricultural because disney leased a 
portion to a cattle rancher and contracted with a timber company to 
harvest pine trees 
the property was assessed at 269 million last year and the 
company paid osceola 395000 in taxes after removing the 
agricultural exemption day in july reassessed the land at 84 
million 
disney contends even last years taxes were excessive because the 
1988 payment was based on a commercial classification for part of 
the property as well as on the portion classified agricultural 
disneys estimated payment monday represents the total amount of 
1989 taxes the company believes it owes because all of that land 
rightfully should be classified as agricultural ridgway said 
under the law you pay what you feel you should properly pay 
he said 
by contrast disney paid its other host county orange 24 
million in taxes last year and is expected to pay 3365 million 
this year 
much of the companys orange county property contains its 
prosperous tourist attractions in recent years disney has built 
the disneymgm studios park pleasure island and typhoon lagoon next 
in orange near the osceola land 
but osceola commissioner larry whaley said we have just as 
many problems from disney as orange county does and theyre getting 
33 million in taxes 
osceola in 1973 tried to strip disney of its agricultural 
classification but disney won a legal battle but the tourist 
attraction has grown since then county officials argue and have 
had a greater impact on the county

apple computer incs first portable macintosh 
computer is more expensive bigger and heavier than the latest 
generation of laptops but the company said tuesday it makes no 
compromises on features 
apple hopes to offset the drawbacks of its macintosh portable by 
giving users all the power and features they would get on a 
fullsize macintosh 
its a macintosh through and through now our customers can 
have macintosh personal computing anywhere jeanlouis gassee 
president of apple products said in a statement 
analysts have been lukewarm toward apples first portable 
i think itll do well with apples existing customer base im 
not sure itll gain share in the overall laptop market though 
said bruce lupatkin an analyst at hambrecht amp quist in san 
francisco its a little little big and its also a little 
pricey 
the portable lists at 5799 or 6499 with an optional 
40megabyte hard disk for data storage a modem for communication 
over phone lines is extra at 449 the weight is 137 pounds or 
157 pounds with the optional 40megabyte hard disk 
the screen is onetone rather than color but is unusually sharp 
because there is a separate transistor for each screen dot or 
picture element the screen contains more than 250000 picture 
elements in a 640 by 400 array making it 50 percent larger than the 
screen on a macintosh se 
to conserve batteries apple used a version of the motorola 68000 
processor chip that requires 80 percent less power it also used a 
lowpower kind of memory chip the lead acid batteries last from six 
to 12 hours and can be recharged to capacity at any time apple said 
apple based in cupertino calif also announced the macintosh 
iici an advanced version of the macintosh iicx which it billed as 
the most powerful macintosh that apple has ever developed 
the macintosh iici starts at 6269 and ranges up to 9152 
putting it in the price range of some computer workstations 
machines designed for scientists and engineers apple said it 
delivers 55 percent higher performance than the macintosh iicx or 
iix it has builtin video capabilities

ford motor co announced plans tuesday to buy up to 
15 percent of jaguar plc saying it wanted a longterm relationship 
with the unprofitable british luxury auto maker 
jaguar which has been battered by flagging sales in its 
principal us market during the past year maintained that it 
wanted to remain independent but didnt rule out collaborating with 
another car company 
ford which already has a huge european presence and is 
negotiating a possible transaction with swedish automaker saab 
could benefit from an association with the wellknown jaguar luxury 
car line analysts said 
jaguar stock soared 97 cents to close at 733 a share on 
londons stock exchange as some speculated that other companies 
also might be assembling stakes in jaguar 
jaguars articles of association limit individual shareholdings 
to 15 percent until the end of 1990 and the government has veto 
power over any takeover through the same period 
it has always been our desire to maintain our independence 
said jaguar spokesman who wasnt identified in keeping with company 
policy however the spokesman also said jaguar has held out the 
possibility of collaborating with another car maker 
the spokesman said the coventrybased company was notified of 
fords plans on tuesday and that jaguar wouldnt make any final 
comment until its board of directors had a chance to discuss them at 
an unspecified date 
ford of europe chairman lindsey halstead speaking at a london 
news conference said his companys intentions are not hostile he 
characterized contact with jaguar chairman sir john egan on tuesday 
as friendly and open and we agreed to leave the lines of 
communication open 
the two companies held private informal talks last year which 
failed to produce any sort of working agreement halstead said 
ford has informed the british government of its plans but has not 
gotten a reaction from british officials said ford spokesman 
michael perry 
the spokesman said it is too early to say what might happen 
then 1990 but we regard the acquisition of a minority 
shareholding in jaguar as a basis for a longerterm strategic 
association between our two companies as we explained to john egan 
in private discussion 
perry also said ford respected jaguars distinctive british 
character and would want to maintain its separate identity and help 
strengthen its image 
last wednesday jaguar posted an aftertax loss of 17 million 
on sales of 870 million for the first six months of the year 
the company expects to sell 20000 cars in the united states this 
year down from 20700 in 1988 
ford of europe which is headquartered in brentwood england 
makes 18 million vehicles a year it has 21 european plants 11 of 
them in britain and employs more than110000 people 
parent ford motor co is the second largest us automaker behind 
general motors corp ford posted an industry record profit of 53 
billion or 1096 a share on revenue of 9245 billion in 1988 
ford confirmed earlier this month that it was negotiating with 
saabscania ab the swedish airplane truck and automaker over a 
possible transaction 
peter caldwell automotive analyst at smith new court plc said 
ford may have made its move now because it believed jaguars share 
price was headed higher or because it wanted to preempt a move by 
another auto maker 
david blackwood an automotive analyst at the london investment 
firm hoare govett ltd said he would not be surprised if other 
automakers also were buying jaguar stakes 
although jaguar is losing money its brand name is highly 
valuable the analysts said 
halstead said jaguar could benefit from fords european 
production and marketing jaguar could benefit from economies of 
scale in parts and materials purchasing as well as from fords 
engineering research 
ford spokesman perry said the company has begun buying jaguar 
shares on the open market but he declined to elaborate on fords 
purchases 
under us antitrust law ford must notify the government once it 
acquiresa 15 million worth of jaguar stock about a 12 percent 
stake and then would have to wait 30 days before buying more

most of united airlines 24000 nonunion workers 
face a 10 percent pay cut if the 675 billion employee buyout of 
parent ual corp goes through as planned according to a published 
report tuesday 
meanwhile united pilots who are spearheading the takeover 
effort demonstrated their good faith by flying the airlines new 
boeing 747400 jets something they had refused to do since june due 
to a labor dispute 
quoting an unidentifed adviser to the buyout group the chicago 
suntimes said the 10 percent pay cut would apply to managers and 
most other salaried workers 
the lowestpaid clerical workers would not be affected nor would 
employees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skills 
and training since those workers could easily find comparable jobs 
with other airlines the newspaper said 
ual spokesman joe hopkins declined to comment on the report 
hank krakowski a spokesman for the united chapter of the air 
line pilots association said he could not confirm the story 
thats between ual management and those workers krakowski 
said we dont have any say about how thats going to come down 
the pilots union revealed last week that uniteds 7000 pilots 
would take pay cuts of up to 10 percent as part of the 300ashare 
buyout plan accepted last thursday by uals board of directors 
the plan calls for ual workers to own 75 percent of the company 
with management owning 10 percent and british airways plc 15 
percent ual chairman stephen wolf and john c pope uals chief 
financial officer would continue to run the company for the new 
employeeowners 
leaders of the united chapter of the association of flight 
attendants were meeting in denver to discuss managementproposed 
contract concessions that would enable them to participate in 
ownership of the nations secondlargest airline

a late bout of selling sent stock prices tumbling 
just before the closing bell despite good news on the inflation 
front that had kept prices firmer during much of the session 
the market opened higher after two new economic reports suggested 
that inflationary pressures had eased further during august but 
while bluechip stocks gained the broader market lagged behind 
traders said 
the labor department reported that consumer prices remained 
unchanged in august as measured by its consumer price index it was 
the best inflation performance in more than three years prices were 
up a modest 02 percent in both june and july 
the commerce department also reported that housing construction 
fell 5 percent in august the largest decline in six months new 
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 135 million units down from 142 million units in july 
wall street analysts said the data suggested an easing of 
inflationary pressures and added to hopes that the federal reserve 
will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates 
although institutional trading was light selling by institutions 
early in the afternoon wiped out some of the markets earlier gains 
the market showed some confidence after a rally in the junk bond 
market following canadian retail giant campeau corps announcement 
that it had secured a 250 million loan to pay its creditors 
junk bond prices had fallen sharply in recent sessions after word 
of campeaus financial troubles raised concern about the viability 
of the highyield highrisk securities campeau had used junk bonds 
to finance recent acquisitions 
but late in the day stocks retreated under pressure of a late 
bout of computerdriven program selling transportation and 
pharmaceutical stocks were among the few standouts in an otherwise 
featureless session traders said

companies to help teach marketoriented management 
mosbacher told an audience of polish and american business 
leaders the economic changes in poland are as impressive as the

foreignowned enterprises mosbacher said

tadeusz mazowiecki and foreign trade minister marcin swiecicki

efforts to reverse polands economic crisis 
mosbacher is one of the first guests at the new marriot hotel 
being completed in a long unfinished warsaw skyscraper the hotel is 
a joint venture with the polish airlines lot and is considered a 
major test of the potential for american investment in poland 
numerous obstacles face wouldbe investors including an 
antiquated telephone system and the scarcity of even basic business 
supplies such as paper 
but beurt servaas an indianoplis publishing executive who heads 
the us polish business council said his seven years of 
investment in poland leads him to believe there are opportunities 
it cost us some money to get started and i call that

the agriculture department reported late monday that 6 percent of 
the corn crop had been harvested in the 17 largest corngrowing 
states as of sunday while 1 percent of the soybean crop had been cut

temperatures sunday night in the corn belt but with the crops at or 
rapidly approaching maturity the danger of significant frost damage 
is almost past mao said 
crudeoil futures fell steeply on the new york mercantile 
exchange paced by liquidation in the expiring october crudeoil

us stocks of petroleum distillates including heating oil 
increased by 161 million barrels last week gasoline stocks rose by

42gallon barrel after having dropped 8 cents on monday

relieve the overbought condition beutel said 
there were spates of buying during the day but prices were 
unable to hold at higher levels beutel said the october west texas 
intermediate contract traded as high as 1980 during the session 
before dropping back 
oil traders have become cautious in advance of saturdays meeting 
of the strategy and pricemonitoring committee of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries 
the eightmember committee which is expected to discuss opecs 
overproduction problems cannot make any changes in the cartels 
policies but can make recommendations to the full 13nation 
organization 
many analysts say market prices could weaken significantly if 
opec fails to show at this weekends meeting that it plans to act 
decisively to contain overproduction

the democraticcontrolled house labor and 
education comittee bowed tuesday to president bushs rejection of 
anything more than a 425 minimum wage 
but it coupled the 90cent increase in the present 335anhour 
wage floor with restrictions on the 80 percent subminimum training 
wage that bush is demanding a move that administration officials 
say will prompt another veto 
on a partyline voice vote the committee approved a bill 
identical to a measure bush vetoed in june except that it provides 
two hourly increases one this january and the other in january 
1991 of 45 cents each the vetoed bill had provided for three 
annual increases to 455 an hour by oct 1 1991 
labor secretary elizabeth dole reiterated in a memo bushs 
promise to veto any bill which raises the current 335 floor to 
425 in less than three years or that establishes a subminimum 
training wage only for firsttime job market entrants bush 
would allow employers to pay an 80 percent subminimum to any newly 
hired workers 
the committees chairman rep augustus f hawkins dcalif 
said the reduction from the previous 455 wage floor that had been 
sought was aimed at garnering support from southern democrats and 
some republicans for an override of another bush veto 
while both the house and senate last year approved the 455 
minimum wage with a 60day subminimum training wage applicable only 
to firsttime workers neither could muster the twothirds majority 
needed to override bushs veto 
there are some republican members ready to change their votes 
if the president doesnt show a willingness to compromise hawkins 
said 
senate sources said the bill could be brought up there within the 
next three weeks just before congress recessed in august the 
senate labor committee reapproved the same 455 minimum wage bill 
that bush vetoed but with the understanding that it would likely be 
modified on the senate floor 
bush has demanded a sixmonth training wage compared to the 
60day subfloor democrats are willing to allow both sides have 
indicated a willingness to negotiate away differences in the time 
span but neither is budging on the applicability 
rep austin murphy dpa chairman of the house panels labor 
standards subcommittee said bushs proposal would allow employers 
to pay a 340 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new hires in 
and out every 60 days to six months 
i must say to the president read my lips murphy said 
adopting bushs campaign motto on higher taxes no way will i 
permit that man to sign a fake increase in the minimum wage for some 
political purpose two years down the road

conagra inc which lost to tyson foods inc 
in the battle to merge with holly farms inc reported record sales 
and earnings tuesday for the first quarter of its fiscal year 
earnings for the quarter ended aug 27 increased 31 percent to 
50 million or 60 cents a share from 382 million or 48 cents a 
share in the same quarter a year ago 
sales rose 43 percent to 401 billion from 281 billion in the 
yearago quarter 
although conagra lost to tyson in the fight for holly farms the 
omahabased food company received a 50 million payment from holly 
farms in june as part of an agreement in case the merger with the 
chicken processor failed 
conagra reported a 269 million onetime aftertax gain in the 
quarter from the settlement after expenses it also took a 248 
million aftertax charge from a realignment of its processed meat 
operations 
charles m harper chairman and chief executive officer said the 
company is headed for its 10th straight year of record earnings he 
said sales could reach 16 billion in fiscal 1990 
the major source of conagras sales gain in the fiscal first 
quarter was sipco formerly known as swift independent packing 
company which has annual sales in excess of 3 billion 
conagra acquired the remaining 50 percent of sipco effective the 
beginning of fiscal 1990 and all sipco sales were included in the 
fiscal first quarter 
harper said gains were made in the quarter in all three of 
conagras basic food industry segments consumer frozen foods 
earnings were up sharply in the largest industry segment prepared 
foods 
poultry earnings advanced and operating profit moved up in the 
fresh red meat business as strong beef processing more than offset 
weak pork results the company said 
tyson foods assumed control of 20 percent of the domestic poultry 
market last month with the completion of its 14 billion merger 
with holly farms the buyout followed a takeover struggle for holly 
farms that began last october and pitted tyson against conagra

payments on its huge foreign debt only if it receives 3 billion in 
pending credits from its lenders 
the position of brazil now is that if it receives the credits 
it will pay otherwise no the mexican government news agency 
notimex quoted de nobrega as saying 
according to notimex de nobrega said brazil expects to reach a 
temporary agreement with the international monetary fund to obtain 
3 billion in credits so it can renew service payments on its 110 
billion foreign debt the largest in the third world 
in may it was impossible to reach agreement with the imf but 
now there is confidence it can be achieved which will allow funds 
to be liberated to cover our commitments with international banks 
de nobrega said 
brazil has not declared a moratorium it suspended payments 
because we did not have money and we have not received around 3 
billion from japan and creditor banks he added 
de nobrega was quoted as saying the credits will tide his country 
over until whoever is elected president in november takes office in 
march 1990 he said the new government then will formulate a policy 
on the debt 
brazil has not paid 16 billion in interest payments that came 
due friday its officials plan to meet with officials of the imf in 
new york later this week 
brazilian officials said their country will not be seeking a 
deadline extension on on debt payments as some reports have 
suggested 
the treasury minister is part of a group of brazilian government 
bankers attending a meeting in this caribbean resort heads of 
federal reserve agencies from latin america spain and the 
philippines are meeting to discuss international strategies to deal 
with the imf and the world bank 
sergio amaral adviser on international relations in brazils 
treasury ministry who spoke with the associated press by telephone 
he denied that his government will ask the imf for a 90day 
extension on debt payments 
notimex on monday quoted wadico waldir bucchi a governor of the 
brazilian central bank as saying brazil cannot meet its 
obligations but is seeking to gain time in order to receive a 600 
million loan awaiting imf approval that will be used to service the 
debt 
notimex quoted bucchi as saying he is sure the imf will grant the 
90day extension when he meets later this week with officials of 
that organization in new york 
however amaral called this report a misunderstanding 
brazil has the biggest foreign debt in the third world 
the south american country has previously suspended payments and 
according to news reports in brazil such a moratorium would help 
maintain its reserves of 6 billion but would hurt its chances of 
obtaining fresh money from international lenders
