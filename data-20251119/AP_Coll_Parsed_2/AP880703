china announced it has developed a new more 
powerful rocket in its successful long march series and said it 
soon will launch a meteorological satellite into space 
the new long march 4 has a propelling power of 300 tons and the 
capability of putting a 25ton payload into orbit the official 
xinhua news agency said late saturday 
aeronautics officials hope the new rocket will help attract more 
foreign customers for chinas nearly 3yearold satellite launch 
service which despite cutrate prices has only one customer under 
contract 
china has launched 22 of its own satellites in the past 18 years 
using the long march 1 2 and 3 rockets 
most recently the long march 3 sent a communications satellite 
into orbit that china said would double domestic communications 
capacity 
the long march 3 was introduced in april 1984 it can put up to 
14ton load in longdistance orbit and up to 3 tons in 
lowaltitude orbit 
the xinhua report quoted chen shouchun chief engineer of the 
great wall industrial corp chinas launch company as saying the 
no 3 rocket uses advanced lowtemperature technology applied in 
only a few other countries 
he did not give any details about the new long march 4 
xinhua said in november that scientists had modified the long 
march 3 to nearly double its launch capabilities it was not clear 
if that modified version was the same as the long march 4 
china announced its international launch service in october 
1985 hoping to take advantage of the halt in the us space 
shuttle and european launching programs caused by accidents 
the great wall industrial corp has reported numerous inquiries 
from potential foreign customers but only one sweden space co 
has signed a formal contract 
china agreed in december to launch a scientific and 
telecommunications satellite for sweden using the long march 2 no 
date has been set 
last month china signed a tentative agreement with a consortium 
of three chinese british and hong kong companies to launch a 
communications satellite to serve asia 
similar nonbinding launch agreements with two us companies 
teresat inc and pan american pacific corp subsequently fell 
through

at least 100000 slovak roman 
catholics converged on a remote hillside sunday in a show of 
religious strength 40 years after the communist takeover 
the pilgrims thronged the virgin mary church in levoca an 
eastern slovak town of 11000 about 25 miles from the polish 
border some said they walked up to 125 miles 
pilgrims and some independent observers said that up to 200000 
people may have attended the pilgrimage which began friday and is 
an annual event started more than 200 years ago 
interest in religion before our very eyes is growing stefan 
garaj the apostolic administrator of spiss diocese told the crowd 
at an open air mass 
thousands arrived friday and stayed through sunday for 20 hours 
of masses prayer sessions and singing that climaxed with sundays 
open air mass 
czechoslovakias catholics have been buoyed by the recent 
consecration of two auxiliary bishops in prague and bishop jan 
sokol in trnava slovakias largest diocese 
the church has also been strengthened by a petition signed by 
about 600000 people calling for religious freedom and the 
appointment of new bishops 
about 60 percent of the 155 million residents of czechoslovakia 
are roman catholics according to church officials most of them 
are slovaks 
garaj hailed pope john paul ii as the greatest pilgrim of our 
century the pope was not at the pilgrimage 
many worshipers spent the night in tents 
elderly slovak women knelt in the mud hours after a downpour had 
soaked the ground groups of young people trekked up and down the 
hill led by youths carrying wooden crosses 
attendance at the levoca pilgrimage dropped during the 1950s but 
began to pick up again in 1968 during a brief liberalization 
attempt in czechoslovakia it was crushed when soviet tanks 
intervened attendance has been growing since then 
police watched the crowd climb the hill on three different treks 
but did not interfere an unspecified number of plainclothes police 
were said to be observing the rites 
the recent appointment of bishops came after 15 years in which 
the prague government and the vatican failed to agree on candidates 
acceptable to both sides 
none of the three new bishops is a member of pacem in terris a 
progovernment clergymens organization banned by the vatican

think of recent democratic national 
conventions sweet harmony doesnt exactly spring to mind 
more like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battles 
in chicago 20 years ago or the lastditch floor fight that sen 
edward m kennedy waged against president carter in 1980 or a 
nasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman four 
years ago that weakened walter f mondale almost on the eve of his 
nomination 
but this time officials in michael dukakis campaign and other 
democrats pointing to quick work on platform rules and 
credentials issues say they expect to present a unified front to 
their fourday primetime television audience beginning on july 18 
barring an unexpected disruption by jesse jackson or his supporters 
over the selection of a vice presidential running mate of course 
the party is as unified as it has been since 1964 and that 
was when you had an incumbent president says paul kirk 
democratic party chairman and the man who managed kennedys 
unsuccessful campaign in 1980 
kirks view is semishared by eddie mahe a republican political 
consultant they are willing to subordinate any and all personal 
and interest group agendas in the interests of victory he says 
of this years democrats 
but mahe added that democratic unity is likely to prove 
shortlived and that special interests will reassert themselves if 
dukakis wins the white house in the fall 
the day they win katie bar the door he said 
thats a problem democrats will worry about if and when the time 
comes 
dukakis has made a number of largely symbolic concessions to 
jackson since the primary season ended and party officials are 
crowing about the relatively smooth transition between the primary 
campaign and the convention 
jackson who will have the support of more 1100 delegates at 
the convention has said repeatedly that he deserves a vice 
presidential offer and that he has decided whether he would accept 
one but wont say what his decision is he and his wife will have 
dinner at the dukakis massachusetts home on monday and the topic 
of the vice presidency is expected to come up 
dukakis is widely expected by his aides to select a different 
running mate and the massachusetts governor frequently quotes 
jacksons earlier statements that a nominee is entitled to make his 
own pick 
other democrats say they doubt jackson will raise a furor if he 
is passed over although there has been no clue about what might 
happen if dukakis chooses a political partner whom jackson finds 
offensive 
i think he has been and will be very positive no matter what 
happens said rep richard gephardt the missouri congressman who 
challenged for the presidential nomination last winter 
with the exception of the vice presidential nomination this 
years democratic campaign has been remarkably free of the types of 
disputes that produced divisions in earlier conventions 
this year 
dukakis wrapped up the nomination on the final day of the 
primaries and unlike in 1980 and 1984 no one has questioned his 
control over a majority of delegates 
jackson has continued to campaign publicly occasionally sniping 
at the massachusetts governor but thus far has never suggested 
summoning his forces for an allout fight such as the one kennedy 
waged in 1980 
the other losing contenders generally have endorsed dukakis 
warmly and most of them are expected to speak at the convention 
although gary hart will be in atlanta writing a newspaper column 
and offering commentary for an italian television audience 
democratic draftsmen came up with the shortest platform in 
decades in keeping with dukakis desires and kirks hope of 
avoiding a litany of social cultural or ideological buzzwords 
dukakis yielded to jackson on some issues notably his desire to 
brand south africa a terrorist state and his call for periodic 
increases in the federal minimum wage to keep pace with inflation 
jackson has described the platform as bland and his aides have 
filed a dozen minority planks for possible votes at the convention 
but kirk says if there are planks that will be discussed and 
debated it will be a civil agreement to disagree 
dukakis aides sound almost like they welcome a floor vote to 
demonstrate their stand against higher taxes and a pentagon freeze 
two key jackson demands there may be some fights and thats a 
normal part of the process and michael dukakis will stick to his 
position says leslie dach the campaigns communications 
director 
dukakis agreed to several concessions sought by jackson on 
party rules covering the 1992 campaign that mollified jackson 
without costing this years winner anything dukakis will not care 
about the selection of delegates in 1992 if he loses this year 
and wont have to worry about it if he wins and is running for 
reelection 
thus he agreed to a sharp reduction in the number of automatic 
super delegates who will attend the 1992 convention the party 
officials who have overwhelmingly favored dukakis this year he 
also consented to jacksons demand to award all other delegates in 
1992 in proportion to the vote received in primaries 
all potential credentials challenges were ironed out between 
the dukakis and jackson forces averting a floor fight jackson 
picked up eight new delegates in new jersey six in puerto rico and 
three in kansas in the process most of them came from dukakis who 
has more than he needs

george bush was talking about crime and 
politics and democrats versus republicans sounding for all the 
world like the presidential candidate he is 
but something was missing there was no specific mention of his 
democratic rival michael dukakis the reason this new york 
speech was not a campaign trip it was a party building mission 
paid for by the gop 
the semantic distinction in which bush attacks liberals or 
democrats but not dukakis by name has allowed the vice president 
to take several trips on the republican party tab at a time when 
his own campaign funds are virtually gone 
since the primaries ended june 7 bush has taken nine 
outofstate swings five of them at least partially financed by 
the republican national committee 
the practice is legal under federal election commission 
guidelines but demonstrates a loophole the bush camp has found to 
keep his campaign in the public eye 
democrats accuse bush of sleight of checkbook to circumvent the 
law that places a 23 million ceiling on primary campaign spending 
bush is pushing the limit having spent 213 million by the 
beginning of june he severely cut back on campaign spending to 
avoid surpassing the cap before the republican national convention 
aug 1518 
the rnc will be pitching in to help with expenses once the 
convention declares bush the nominee but can give him no more than 
5000 while he is still technically a primary candidate 
thats where party building has come in handy the rnc can spend 
whatever it wants to help its gop candidates and state party 
organizations around the country 
such spending logically includes sending a sitting vice 
president on speechmaking tours to help promote the gop cause 
says bush spokeswoman ede holiday 
hes got a proven track record as one of the best fundraisers 
in the republican party she said adding that the party would 
utilize bush even if he was not a presidential candidate 
its not so much his dual role however as the financial 
arrangements that explain why sometimes his talks are peppered with 
criticism of dukakis his certain opponent in november and other 
times laced only with general attacks on democrats 
bush told the new york fundraising luncheon on thursday 
i am under these constraints because this is a partybuilding 
event that means i cannot put in perspective the differences 
between me and the man ill be running against 
he then proceeded with a lively attack on liberals in a clearly 
coded reference to dukakis 
you can call it party building but its campaigning said 
democratic national committee spokeswoman julie anbender when 
the vice president is the certain presidential nominee and is 
traveling around the country it is fairly evident that his 
primary purpose is to promote his candidacy 
if he doesnt talk about his opponent its not a campaign 
trip countered bush campaign attorney trevor potter the 
republicans are being very careful not to do this one wrong if 
theres any question they allocate it to the campaign 
once the republican convention nominates him in august bush 
will get an infusion of 46 million from the federal treasury for 
his campaign and the democratic nominee will get the same amount 
in addition the national parties are allowed to spend 83 million 
each on their nominees 
even trips to raise the 83 million are not necessarily 
considered campaignrelated by the republicans because the 83 
million while designated to help elect bush is party money 
rather than campaign money potter said 
any rnc spending on bush before the convention is not counted 
against the 83 million because he is not the nominee yet 
despite democratic frustration the gop practice is totally 
within the statutes and the regulations said federal election 
commission spokeswoman sharon snyder 
she said the law recognizes the double or triple functions and 
double or triple hats a that a candidate may wear 
the bush forces are quick to point out that they are not 
charging any of bushs travel in this postprimary period to the 
taxpayers even when he is invited to speak in his vice 
presidential capacity in those cases the campaign has scheduled 
fundraising events in the same state so the rnc can pick up the 
tab 
even his air force two plane expenses are charged to the 
campaign to avoid charges of using his office 
the campaign is particularly sensitive on the issue potter 
said in light of a complaint filed against president reagans 
campaign when he charged a veterans of foreign wars speech to the 
white house budget rather than the campaign the fec decision that 
there was no violation in that case is the subject of an ongoing 
federal court case

six weeks before the republican national 
convention officials here are doing everything they can to avoid 
the problems that have been reported in atlanta convention city of 
the democrats 
city officials desperately want to show the world that new 
orleans is a good place to do business not just a great place to 
party 
we have never had this kind of opportunity before and i think 
the people have basically responded said mayor sidney barthelemy 
after a rocky start the civic machinery is humming along for 
the aug 1518 convention 
in atlanta by contrast persistent reports of poor planning and 
confusion are marring the road to the july 1821 democratic 
gathering not ready for prime time barked the headline about 
atlanta in one national newsmagazine last week 
its the kind of spotlight new orleans officials have been 
working all year to avoid 
the city is no stranger to big events annual mardi gras street 
parties six super bowls a papal visit and the 1984 worlds fair 
but this is different the convention comes at a time when the 
city is reeling from an economic depression caused by a slump in 
the oil industry 
ron jones a local businessman and vice chairman of the host 
committee sees the convention as a major step toward helping the 
city and state recover from the oil slump which sent unemployment 
rates in louisiana soaring to the highest in the nation 
we have an opportunity with this convention to change how the 
people of the united states perceive the city of new orleans and 
the state of louisiana said jones 
barthelemy and others are hoping the gop meeting will rid the 
city once and for all of any negative feelings left over from the 
1984 worlds fair 
although the fair was a great party it was a financial flop 
that drew mostly negative publicity bad press started the day 
before it opened and stories of its financial problems and 
lawsuits followed 
there were never any logistical problems with the worlds 
fair wilson said the problem was not enough good publicity 
and not enough people came to it 
when the national media shows up this time organizers will have 
10000 volunteer workers to make sure delegates reporters and 
convention guests find everything in place 
we want to see that everything is ready from hotels and night 
spots down to the little man in his house whos being asked to 
hang a flag out councilwoman peggy wilson said 
a 280000 message center will be set up in the superdome jones 
said computer terminals in the major hotels will allow delegates 
and reporters to check messages from various points in the city 
two fundraising groups are raising the 55 million new orleans 
agreed to put up when it signed the contract to host the convention 
we cant afford another tax barthelemy said we had to go 
another route so were asking for contributions 
collections got off to a slow start but by the third week of 
june 60 percent of the money had been raised according to pat 
taylor head of taylor oil co and head fundraiser 
convention manager bill phillips says hes not worried about the 
citys ability to pay im not concerned about the city living up 
to its obligations they have met every one of them on time he 
said 
phillips also said he sees no reason to worry yet about another 
possible snag a police organizations demands that the city enter 
into a collective bargaining agreement 
in dallas in 1984 the police and the taxi drivers both said 
they were going to strike if something wasnt agreed upon and 
neither did said phillips the city has said theyre talking 
with the police association and its coming along its a wait and

the house and senate are drifting into the 
waning days of this years session gridlocked in a struggle to pass 
legislation addressing the continuing woes of the securities 
industry 
news from the stock market over the last several months raises 
the kinds of issues congress usually pounces on quickly 
one trillion dollars in equity values vanish overnight in 
historys worst stock market crash 
billions of dollars go up for grabs in an endless series of 
corporate takeover battles 
insider trading scams net millions of dollars in illegal profits 
yet no bills are even close to passage 
congressional offices have files fat with testimony theyve 
collected at hearings on wall streets problems but most lawmakers 
and lobbyists seem convinced that the chances of any major 
legislation being enacted in 1988 are increasingly remote 
im unhappy about it said senate banking committee chairman 
william proxmire dwis who is retiring from congress next year 
and has made stock market legislation a priority in his final 
months in office but theres not much i can do 
turf fights have slowed the proposals as regulatory agencies 
securities exchanges and even congressional committees with market 
jurisdiction struggle to expand or retain powers they now have 
deeper divisions exist however over the very need for new 
laws the growing influence of the futures markets increasingly 
common dramatic price swings and hostile takeovers are villains to 
some but others say they are little more than inevitable changes 
that do more good than harm and that legislation could not control 
anyway 
no one is for the crash said executive director sarah 
teslik of the council of institutional investors which represents 
large pension funds it would be lovely to say here are the 
problems but is there a problem 
the measures that have been introduced are ambitious attempts to 
stifle what their sponsors say is abusive unbridled behavior that 
threatens the nations economy 
one proxmire bill a response to last octobers stock market 
collapse would tighten federal regulation of the stock futures 
and options exchanges 
an intermarket coordination committee would be formed 
consisting of the chiefs of the federal reserve board the 
securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures 
trading commission the committee would create circuit breakers 
to automatically shut down trading if wild price swings occur and 
make a range of changes designed to dampen speculation and enhance 
information gathering by the exchanges 
a second proxmire measure attempts to clamp down on corporate 
raiders by forcing them to make their takeover efforts more public 
a third bill introduced last thursday by rep rick boucher dva 
would require brokerage firms to set up systems to weed out insider 
trading and offer bounties to people who tell the authorities 
about the leaking of privileged information 
all three proposals face imposing hurdles in a year in which 
congress has only about 50 work days left and in which lawmakers 
are becoming increasingly distracted by the political campaigns 
the market regulation legislation has yet to make it out of 
proxmires own committee and has still not been introduced in the 
house it has run into opposition from the reagan administration 
many lawmakers federal regulators and market officials who 
question whether any changes are needed and its supporters have 
lost momentum as the crash recedes further into the past 
its a case of everyone sort of stumbling around and in the 
meantime the problem seems to be going away says aa sommer 
jr a lawyer who monitors capitol hill for business groups 
proxmire brought his corporate raider bill to the senate floor 
last month only to see his colleagues vote to attach what he calls 
killer amendments provisions that would help raiders by limiting 
the defenses corporate managers could use the surprised lawmaker 
pulled the bill off the floor and says he still hasnt decided what 
hell do next 
the insider trading legislation may have the best chance of 
passage especially with last weeks new charges against an 
investor and a trader accused of earning 19 million in illegal 
profits 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee and a cosponsor of 
bouchers bill says the insider trading measure is his best 
bet for action as james e heard a washington consultant to 
financial institutions argues theres nobody whos against 
stronger enforcement or tightening up insider trading laws 
but boucher and his allies still need to sell their proposal to 
their colleagues who will have numerous measure competing for 
their attention as the 100th congress winds down 
even if the securities bills are not approved in 1988 lawmakers 
pressing the legislation are succeeding in keeping the stock market 
issue in the news and getting public reaction to their ideas 
we may not be able to get everything passed this year but 
well set the stage for next year markey said

the great cuban jazz musician machito died in 
1986 but the jvc jazz festivals tribute to him provided ample 
evidence that the afrocuban jazz tradition machito fathered is 
strong and well 
on saturday night carnegie hall resounded with the salsa and 
jazz of mongo santamaria paquito drivera tito puente and celia 
cruz in a concert that underscored the continuing vibrancy of 
machitos legacy 
machito came from cuba to new york in the late 1930s and is 
generally credited with being the first to combine cuban rhythms 
with jazz melodies and harmonies 
among the members of machitos early orchestras was a young 
drummer named tito puente who ultimately launched his own big band 
after world war ii and has become one of the biggest names in latin 
music 
puente appeared with his big band saturday night at the machito 
tribute where he performed with all the vigor of the young man who 
once worked for machito 
puentes music is a true salsajazz fusion seamlessly mixing 
jazzinflected horn arrangements with a churning latin rhythm 
section while the latin rhythmic groove was paramount in 
everything puente played he also revealed an introspective side 
with a silky mysterious performance of autumn leaves which he 
played on vibraphone 
puente followed a rousing opening set by mongo santamaria whose 
smaller band revealed crisp clean rhythms and taught arrangements 
santamaria was followed in turn by the cubanamerican alto 
saxophonist paquito drivera who has brought latin music to a 
wider audience of jazz afficionados 
driveras quartet opened with a deft interpretation of all 
the things you are and later welcomed dave valentin the puerto 
rican flute player for a guest spot 
in one of the few apparent instances of poor planning during the 
concert valentin was ushered off the stage after only one 
selection just as he was warming to the sound of the concert hall 
drivera also introduced to new york a young brazilian singer 
and guitarist named anna caram who performed two breezy numbers 
that revealed a supple if slightly hyperkinetic vocal style and a 
considerable talent as a guitarist 
the high point of the evening came with the appearance of celiz 
cruz the great salsa singer whose 35 years in the business earned 
her a standing ovation before she began to sing 
she delivered several selections in a deep powerful voice 
before all of the evenings musicians gathered on stage for a 
freewheeling performance of machito forever a puente 
composition

the democraticcontrolled congress is bragging 
about a session of unusual productivity although the circumstances 
that have helped make that possible may soon be gone 
we think it is probably the most productive congress in recent 
history house speaker jim wright dtexas said 
the record backs up that statement 
for the first time in years the house has passed all 13 of the 
annual spending bills on time when the final two measures were 
voted on wednesday it was the earliest that had been done in 28 
years 
the catastrophic health insurance bill signed into law friday 
by president reagan is the biggest change in the medicare system 
since the program began 23 years ago 
the senate ratified the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty with the soviet union 
after a seemingly endless partisan battle over aid to 
nicaraguas contra rebels through most of the reagan 
administration lawmakers on both sides of the aisle approved a 
nonweapons aid package 
both the house and senate have approved bills to overhaul the 
nations welfare laws and an agreement between the two chambers is 
being negotiated 
the housing aid programs have been renewed and after years of 
stalemate a compromise has been struck on toughening the nations 
laws against discrimination in housing 
those are some pretty significant things done in this 
congress conceded rep robert h michel the house republican 
leader michel was also quick to point out that republicans 
played a meaningful role in those accomplishments 
still on the agenda are senate completion of the spending bills 
a preelection antidrug bill and another veto fight with 
president reagan over trade and a companion plantclosing 
notification bill and lawmakers are talking optimistically about 
finishing the session on time in the first week of october 
the reason we have been productive is because we have a 
democratic house and a democratic senate wright said after six 
years of gop control democrats won back the senate in the 1986 
election 
but crediting a unified congress as the main reason for the 
legislative success would be misleading 
last year when both chambers were democratic not one of the 
annual spending bills was finished on time the most important 
reason congress was able to move speedily this year was last falls 
deficitreduction pact with reagan which set in advance the 
overall spending levels 
another reason for this years success has been justdeparted 
white house chief of staff howard baker the former senators 
nonconfrontational style and his work directly with congress to 
iron out wrinkles helped keep the process moving on several 
occasions 
this illustrates that there is nothing wrong with the budget 
process that a cooperative president cannot fix said rep 
william h gray iii dpa chairman of the house budget committee 
reagan himself of course is in his final months in office 
like other presidents after a long tenure he has been 
concentrating on foreign policy initiatives including the summits 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
meanwhile domestic programs have regained some of the 
attractiveness in congress that was tarnished in reagans early 
years of antibiggovernment rhetoric 
its in large measure due to the fact that its an election 
year said rep leon panetta dcalif republicans too are 
voting for measures that members can point to as establishing 
their credibility on a broad range of domestic issues 
wrights chief votecounter rep tony coelho dcalif said 
that while republicans have complained about the sometimes 
strongarm tactics of the democrats to keep the schedule moving 
members of both parties were tired of congress traditionally 
chaotic approach 
you have an atmosphere for strong leadership he said but 
if the leadership wasnt willing to take advantage of that it 
wouldnt happen we are always working the system its 
handson 
the test of whether congress is running better will come next 
year 
although most observers expect congress will remain in 
democratic control there will be a new president ambitiously 
pursuing an agenda that may not jive with that of congress and the 
budget summit with reagan will be a memory 
im not so naive as to think we wont fall back into the same 
old syndrome michel said 
if george bush wins congress will again have a white house 
opponent and one with more vigor if dukakis wins there could be 
a clash of the expectations that democrats have pent up in the past 
eight years and the huge national debt that has built up 
we have begun to reverse the trend that was eroding and 
beginning to do away with our domestic infrastructure wright 
said 
a dukakis victory would also take away wrights muchenjoyed 
role as the top elected democrat in the country an adjustment some 
associates say might be difficult for him 
another adjustment will come by next year when the house ethics 
investigation against wright who is accused of using his elective 
office for financial gains should be completed if wright is found 
to have done wrong it could shake up the house leadership 
wright has declared his innocence and has called the current 
probe wearying 
but the ethics case is also a useful distraction for the 
rightwing opposition in the house which is spending more time 
attacking the speaker and less time sabotaging the legislative 
schedule 
i dont think i intended it that way chuckled wright

meteorologists know that a stalled high 
pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in 
middle america but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena 
occurred and when they might end 
in a highpressure system also known as an anticyclone dry air 
gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise 
pattern around the center 
it is the opposite of a cyclone where rising moist 
counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds and thus 
rain 
as followers of newspaper weather maps and broadcast reports 
know americas changing weather pattern generally consists of a 
series of highs and lows anticyclones and cyclones marching 
across the country from west to east 
that pattern is stalled has been for a month or more and is 
likely to stay stalled according to donald l gilman head of the 
longrange predictions group at the national weather service 
in normal times the highs and lows and their accompanying 
weather fronts are steered across the nation by strong 
highaltitude winds known as the jet stream 
tearing across the nations middle and southern sections in 
winter these winds pull along the major storms that many people 
dread 
when warm summer weather comes the jet stream usually edges to 
the north there it brings in moisture from the pacific northwest 
while at the same time helping pull storms north into the nations 
middle from the gulf of mexico 
not so this year gilman said 
the jet stream has split in two one stream is sweeping to the 
north in canada steering pacific storms north of the farm belt 
the second is moving across just south of the united states 
blocking gulf storms from coming north 
and trapped in the middle is that dismally warm and sunny 
anticyclone 
this split is not a rare event if you define rare as 
something that almost never happens but its not frequent 
either said robert livezey an associate of gilmans at the 
federal climate analysis center 
can he say why it occurs 
unfortunately not the processes which lead to this sort of 
event arent well understood right now livezey said 
it may simply be part of the natural variability of the 
atmosphere he said at any rate the meteorologists arent ready 
to attribute it to any specific cause 
thats one of the problems in dynamic meteorology that were 
still working on figuring out how these patterns occur is one of 
the keys to longrange forecasting said paul sabol of the 
climate analysis center 
even determining whether the high caused the jet stream to 
split or the split jet stream trapped the high is difficult 
livezey said 
at any rate the two work together 
the high blocks the movement of storms into the farm belt while 
the jet stream guides them around it 
once that pattern starts the hot dry weather tends to worsen 
and reinforce itself said vernon e kousky also of the climate 
analysis center 
everybody has felt the cooling sensation when water evaporates 
after they get out of the ocean or a pool he explained 
in the same way if you have wet ground some of the solar 
radiation is used to evaporate water the area is kept cooler and 
this is good for man and plants as well 
the drought however has reduced ground moisture without the 
cooling of evaporation and the clouds that the evaporated water 
might eventually form the weather can get hotter and hotter 
you might call it a drought feedback mechanism it tends to 
perpetuate on itself kousky said 
when it will end no one was willing to say 
there is no normal lifetime of a drought they can last from 
several months to years the national weather service noted in a 
statement on the drought 
unfortunately reliable predictions of the droughts end its 
geographic spread or changes in severity cannot be made today 
the service said 
in his longrange forecast gilman called for the current 
weather pattern to continue at least through july the most 
intense focus of the drought may drift to the east and south in the 
next three months he said 
but the pattern of rainfall behind it will be spotty he said 
with only the western parts of the great plains likely to see much 
increase in rain through the end of september whether that will be 
in time to save threatened crops remains to be seen

premier turgut ozal on sunday 
inaugurated the second bridge linking europe to asia and was the 
first to cross it after a ritual sheep sacrifice opened the 
ceremony 
ozal called the eightlane suspension bridge across the bosporus 
strait a monument symbolizing friendship and cooperation between 
turkey and japan and italy the bridge was built by a consortium 
of japanese italian and turkish companies 
the turkish premier then drove his car 14 miles from levent on 
the european side to kozyatagi on the anatolian side followed by 
hundreds of vehicles 
the bridges main span reaches 3597 feet and is about 192 feet 
above the strait it is the sixth longest suspension bridge in the 
world 
thousands of people crowded nearby hills to watch the 
inauguration ceremony which opened after the sheep sacrifice an 
islamic ritual 
dozens of helicopters hovered and thousands of police and 
soldiers enforced tight security measures following reports of 
sabotage threats by japanese red army terrorists 
the 123 million bridge was built in 2 years by ishikawajima 
heavy industries company mitsubishi heavy industries and nippon 
kokan kk of japan impregilo spa of italy and the sezai turkes 
and fevzi akkaya turkish construction company 
in addition to the bridge 111 miles of highways will be 
constructed starting from kinali near the greek border in the 
west passing through istanbul and ending in sakarya in the east 
an additional 24 miles of peripheral roads will be built the total 
cost of the project including the bridge is estimated at 551 
million 
the new bridge is three miles north of the first bridge over the 
bosporus which stretches from hisarustu on the european side to 
kavacik on the anatolian side 
the new bridge was built because of increased traffic over the 
strait between the middle east and europe but the traffic will 
not be significantly eased until the peripheral roads are completed 
by the end of this year officials said 
the daily traffic volume over the first bridge which opened in 
1973 reached more than 130000 vehicles in 1987 according to a 
highways directorate report the report said 426 million vehicles 
had crossed the bridge by november 1987

mikhail s gorbachev emerged from the communist 
partys first national conference in nearly 50 years with political 
reforms he championed but he also endured hostility toward his 
drive for more openness 
such was the mixed scorecard of the fourday conference that 
ended friday 
the 5000 delegates met in the partys first conference since 
josef stalin convened one in 1941 
at gorbachevs urging they ordered an overhaul of the late 
dictators system that vested the nations power and prestige in 
the partys bureaucrats 
by charting the path of political reform gorbachev said the 
kremlin conclave pointed the way to a new democratic image of 
socialism that would enable his economic and social reforms to 
proceed 
resolutions adopted at the conference on topics including 
political reform the openness policy known as glasnost and 
interethnic relations were not immediately made public but a 
preliminary scorecard can be drawn based on delegates speeches 
reports in the staterun media and officials comments to reporters 
gorbachev himself looks like a winner he gained his mandate 
for political change and led the kind of frank often searing 
debate he espouses the disputes starkly contrasted with the 
polite wellordered ceremonial conferences of past kremlin rulers 
among their political reforms the delegates approved creating a 
new more powerful presidency with powers to draft legislation and 
oversee foreign policy and defense a post apparently tailormade 
for gorbachev 
however some delegates to the conference said they were 
awaiting proof that gorbachevs economic reform program in its 
third year will improve life 
until the fine print of the resolutions is made public it would 
be premature to call the conference an unqualified triumph for the 
57yearold communist party chief 
yegor k ligachev the no 2 kremlin leader often rumored to be 
at odds with gorbachev also appeared to have gained ground 
ligachevs extraordinary speech in which he disavowed any 
ideological differences with gorbachev amounted to a ringing 
defense of the partys old guard and a stinging blow to his 
wouldbe rival boris n yeltsin 
yeltsin the onetime protege of gorbachev and former moscow 
party boss came away from the conference a loser he asked 
delegates for political rehabilitation and instead culled 
attacks from a succession of speakers including ligachev and 
gorbachev himself 
yeltsin was stripped of his moscow party post last year and an 
alternate seat on the ruling politburo in february after 
complaining that entrenched bureaucrats were blocking gorbachevs 
reforms 
gorbachev says yeltsin has some good ideas and is energetic but 
that he lacks tact and has been rude 
segments from yeltsins speech and from the frequently acidic 
attacks on him were shown on national television apparently to nip 
any vestiges of popular support for him 
president andrei a gromyko and fellow longtime politburo 
member mikhail s solomentsev both in their 70s may have also 
come away losers in a rare public attack one delegate called them 
and two other senior party figures holdovers from the period of 
stagnation as the era of leonid i brezhnev is now known 
yeltsin also attacked solomentsev by name accusing him of 
protecting corrupt party officials 
ligachev however defended his politburo colleagues saying 
they helped engineer the election of gorbachev as party chief in 
march 1985 
in addition the conference raised questions about the future of 
some groups affected by its decisions 
the journalists known as the glasnost gang the most 
outspoken advocates of gorbachevs openness campaign may have 
suffered a setback 
vitaly korotich editor of the weekly magazine ogonyok and 
grigory baklanov editor of the znamya literary monthly met a 
chilly sometimes hostile reception gorbachev had to intervene 
twice to silence delegates so baklanov could finish speaking the 
editor of the government daily newspaper izvestia ivan laptev was 
also jeered from the floor 
gorbachev proclaimed that openness has been the hero of the 
conference but ligachev specifically endorsed some sentiments in 
a speech by a conservative writer who denounced recent daring press 
forays into the soviet past and present 
party bureaucrats from the countryside to the senior 
leadership suffered 
all party officeholders will now be limited to two fiveyear 
terms before they could serve for life 
it was also clear that local party leaders will lose their jobs 
if they cannot muster enough support to be chosen as chairmen of 
the countrys 50000 local governing councils 
finally the 20 million members of the party rank and file 
whose qualifications will be reviewed this year face uncertainty 
a reevaluation of their standing could be used to blunt 
conservative opposition to gorbachevs reforms

about 3000 nurses walked off the job sunday to 
protest a government health plan they say will increase the burden 
on already understaffed hospitals 
also sunday 900 workers of magen david adom israels version 
of the red cross shut down services after failing to receive june 
paychecks and physicians who have been staging short strikes for 
several months closed outpatient clinics and performed only 
emergency surgery 
the doctors also oppose the governments health proposal which 
calls for shortening the waiting list for operations by introducing 
a second daily surgery shift 
ilana cohen head of the nurses union said the government 
should first substantially increase the number of public hospital 
nurses there are now about 12000 
its inconceivable that they should talk about a second shift 
when the nurses can hardly cope with the first shift she said 
she said the 12000 nurses will take turns striking groups of 
3000 nurses will rotate taking twoweek vacations 
israels debtridden hospital system has been plagued for the 
past two years by strikes and walkouts the government says more 
than 22000 people have been waiting months for elective surgery 
and medical unions say the number is 50000 
the new health plan calls for medical staff to do 15000 
operations in the next nine months 
a committee consisting of prime minister yitzhak shamir deputy 
premier shimon peres finance minister moshe nissim and health 
minister shoshana arbelialmoslino has been named to propose a 
solution to the health crisis 
ms cohen called on the committee to include the professional 
workers in their deliberations

administration sources said it was 
doubtful that the plane shot down by us forces sunday was an 
iranian f14 fighter and that the joint chiefs of staff were 
trying to determine whether it was a civilian airliner as claimed 
by iran 
it is doubtful that an f14 was up there at all said an 
administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
earlier pentagon spokesmen said that us navy forces had shot 
down an iranian fighter jet over the persian gulf and that 
officials were checking out an iranian report that an 
americanfired missile had downed an iran air jetliner carrying 290 
passengers 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm wiliam crowe 
was to brief reporters on the matter early this afternoon 
lt col arnold williams said us officials are aware of the 
iranian claim of the press reports of it and were checking it 
out at the white house a spokesman said the president had been 
kept informed of the incidents in the gulf 
the islamic republic news agency said the iran air jetliner took 
off from bandar abbas at 1015 am 245 am edt and was last 
tracked 7 minutes later the agency said 100 bodies had been 
recovered and all aboard the jetliner were feared killed when two 
us missiles hit it 
major mike stepp said hostilities began in the gulf sunday when 
an iranian gunboat fired at a helicopter at 210 am edt he said 
the helicopter was not hit and that the uss vincennes and the 
frigate uss montgomery returned fire sinking two iranian boats and 
downing a f14 fighter plane that apparently joined the battle 
the spokesman gave no exact time for the shooting down of the 
f14 
no american casualties were reported 
the incident was the first such hostility between the two 
nations since the united states destroyed two oil platforms in 
april 
our reports indicate that two small iranian patrol boats were 
sunk and one was damaged the uss vincennes also reported that it 
downed an iranian f14 aircraft that was approaching in a hostile 
manner the spokesman said 
lt col keith schneider said the fighter jet was approaching 
the vincennes at a high rate of speed in the strait of hormuz 
and that warnings were issued 
it was clearly identified as an f14 it ignored warnings and 
was approaching in a hostile manner schneider said 
he said pentagon officials had not determined whether the f14 
was in sight at the time it was shot down 
he said that after the incident us forces watched an iranian 
helicopter search the area where he said the fighter jet was downed 
and that the american forces were standing clear and allowing 
them to continue their operations 
phyllis oakley state department spokeswoman said seven hours 
after the airliner went down we are certainly very much in touch 
with this but the defense department is handling everything at 
the moment there is not anything for the state department to say

robert merkle who successfully 
prosecuted colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas traded 
his clout as a crimebusting us attorney to mount a us senate 
bid as a latecomer with no money headquarters or paid staff 
he faces a party favorite with a 10month 2 million head start 
and the endorsement of president reagan 
in announcing his candidacy last week merkle forced a sept 6 
republican primary with us rep connie mack who had had no gop 
opposition in the race for the seat being vacated by veteran sen 
lawton chiles a democrat 
that rankles state gop leaders who consider merkle a spoiler 
and an underdog with no chance of winning they complain he never 
even sought the blessing of his party 
it delights democrats and merkles wife and nine children 
its been a long decision said merkles 17yearold son 
matt we all sat around the dinner table and talked everyone put 
in his two cents 
the 44yearold prosecutor who dumped a 17year career to make 
his first try for political office is no stranger to controversy 
during his six years as us attorney in floridas 32county 
middle district merkle battled corrupt public servants drug 
lords attorneys prominent businessmen and highprofile figures 
he took on the governor us senators a county commission 
panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega and onetime 
baseball pitching ace denny mclain 
he just finished successfully prosecuting lehder a leader of 
the violent colombian medellin drug smuggling cartel and he openly 
criticized the reagan administration for considering dropping drug 
indictments against noriega if he would leave panama 
ive dealt with the law in all fashions drugs environment 
national security civil rights labor veteran issues any issue a 
senators work touches on i have worked with because i enforced the 
laws merkle said im sure i understand those issues better 
than connie mack does 
his hard work in the courtroom won him a lot of attention not 
always good 
republican gov bob martinezs office tried to get him fired 
after the governor wound up as a witness combating claims that he 
took illegal campaign contributions while running for mayor of 
tampa martinez was never charged with wrongdoing 
newspapers campaigned for merkles ouster defense attorneys 
decried what they called abusive terrorizing overzealous 
bullying prosecutorial tactics they compared it to mccarthyism and 
called for us justice department investigations which always 
cleared merkle of any inappropriate behavior 
supporters who know him well say he is a masterful litigator 
with an uncanny street sense and he has earned an outstanding 
reputation throughout the criminal justice system 
hes always given 100 percent to everything says his wife 
angela who has been sharing duties as scheduling secretary with 
their older children 
were all pitching in said matt who enlisted three high 
school buddies to help carry campaign posters were all making 
some sacrifices but no one minds 
how many 17yearolds get to be campaign manager at least 
for the first few days when i was the only one around matt added 
merkle has 30000 from his government pension fund for his 
campaign and his classic 1968 mustang for travel 
he doesnt have one iota of a chance said le tommy 
thomas former gop state chairman and head of vice president george 
bushs steering committee in florida 
jeanie austin gop state chairman said she didnt know merkle 
was running until she read about it i think he should have 
contacted the party out of courtesy she said 
there was no comment from mack he is vacationing with his 
wife said press aide mark mills 
marjorie kincaid gop leader in tampa came to merkles defense 
i think theyre wrong hes going to have the power of the people 
behind him she said merkle couldnt enter the race earlier 
because he had an obligation to his job 
democrats locked in a fourway primary battle are thrilled 
with merkles entry 
its a brand new ballgame for the republicans said charlie 
whitehead state democratic chairman the number one issue with 
people today is crime and drugs and bob merkle has been in the 
forefront of that battle prosecuting people 
i dont think he is a fool if he didnt have some indication 
he had a chance he wouldnt have gotten into the race

fearing a loss of identity not to mention 
overworked index fingers a number of massachusetts towns are 
waging a lastditch battle against their banishment from the 617 
area code 
those digits have become synonymous with high technology urban 
sophistication and progressive politics town officials say while 
the new 508 area code is strictly for hicks 
on july 16 approximately 190 communities in central and eastern 
massachusetts are slated to switch from 617 into 508 new england 
telephone co says that the new area code is unavoidable 
quite literally were running out of phone numbers said 
company spokeswoman clare t silvestri 
the states economic boom in addition to launching gov michael 
s dukakis toward the white house has pushed up demand for new 
telephone connections particularly in the corridor of high 
technology firms along route 128 around boston 
part of the problem was caused by the growing number of 
telephone lines needed by computers said spokesman mark marchand 
without the new area code silvestri said the phone company would 
have to set up a waiting list for new numbers sometime early next 
year 
by adding 508 well double the number of numbers available 
essentially overnight she said 
in dover a wealthy bedroom community 15 miles southwest of 
boston residents object to being lumped with rural communities and 
small cities in central massachusetts dovers appeal to remain in 
617 was turned down 
we are intimately a part of the boston area and theyre 
casting us off as total exurbia said j peter grant a mutual 
fund investment manager who lives in dover and works in boston 
we are being put in with worcester and other communities we have 
nothing to do with 
the new boundary of 617 is a rough semicircle around boston 
from marblehead on the north shore to kingston to the south since 
announcing the switchover two years ago the telephone company has 
been assuring the public that it will not hike its fees as a result 
of the change 
when the first map of the 508 district came out 25 cities and 
towns objected to their inclusion in it six of them eventually won 
their return from area code exile two others north reading and 
wilmington are still waiting for rulings from the states public 
utilities commission but without much optimism 
we understand the reasons why theyre doing it and we realize 
it probably has to be done said james c stewart chairman of 
wilmingtons board of selectmen but wed prefer to stay in 617 
and we just wanted to throw in our request even though we realize 
its probably a futile shot 
stewart said businesses object because of the cost of changing 
their stationery and brochures while residents are unhappy about 
having to dial an extra four digits 1 and 617 every time they 
call boston 
wilmington officials also raised some frightening scenarios 
like residents dialing a bostonarea hospital but forgetting about 
the new area code and panicking when they doent get through 
theres going to be a lot of confusion said the towns 
assistant manager jeffrey m hull most of the hospitals that 
wilmington residents use are in the 617 area and that could be a 
problem in an emergency 
following the advice of telephone companies in other states that 
have made similar switches new england telephone has launched a 
directmail and advertising campaign to educate the public about 
the change 
in addition the company said it will provide a threemonth 
grace period in which calls to the wrong area code will still go 
through 
then for approximately a year people who use the wrong area 
code will get a recorded message telling them to redial using the 
correct code 
when new york city separated three of its boroughs queens 
brooklyn and staten island into the 718 area code in 1985 a 
similar public education campaign and a grace period worked well 
according to tina m gimas a spokeswoman for new york telephone co 
massachusetts hasnt always been so resistant to change after 
all the telephone was invented in boston and it was during a 
measles outbreak in 1879 in northern lowell that a major innovation 
in phone service was made 
until then telephone operators memorized each customers name 
and position on a switchboard fearing operators might fall ill 
physician charles parker hit on the idea of assigning each customer 
a number

though william cushner has never felt the 
sweet rhythm of casting a fly rod or the glowing satisfaction of 
tying a fly he has been hooked by a passion for the work of the 
worlds greatest fly tiers 
its the artistry the craft and the skills these men 
possess said cushner a master picture framer who also frames 
flies for display 
cushners been a fly admirer for a long time but what got his 
collection rolling was the demise of the venerable new york city 
angling supplier wm mills amp son 
harry hunt who was liquidating the companys assets opened 
the doors for me cushner recalled we all knew that somewhere 
in that place were the flies of theodore gordon the father of 
american fly fishing i kept buying all morning long 
he suggested he would like to have a set of flies framed for 
himself once i agreed to that the whole picture changed he took 
me down to the basement and showed me flies that were tied in 1870 
i wound up with an inventory of 100000 flies 
the flies are put together with bits of fur feathers and 
anything else that a tier thinks might attract a fish all tied to 
a small hook most are designed to imitate flies that trout and 
salmon feed on along streams and are less than half an inch long 
cushner shows them off with a flair so compelling that other 
collectors frequently offer to share their most prized flies with 
him if he will frame a set for them 
joe howell was here from the north umpqua a famed steelhead 
river in southern oregon cushner said 
he says have you heard of herb howard i said you have a 
set of herb howard he said he had 38 of them he said ill 
split them down the middle with you 
cushner uses a watersoluble glue so they can be removed 
without harm to mount the flies on a tiny clear plastic post 
within the frame 
when i first thought of it i was sitting in the subway and 
all of a sudden i could see in my mind the man casting and the fly 
floating in space said cushner a former denizen of new york 
that got to me so i raised it from its background which gives 
it its whole dimension 
cushner combines flies with a painting print carving 
photograph or some other work of art taking special care that they 
relate to each other 
given the fact that i did not fish or tie flies i had to make 
this interesting for myself cushner said 
an etching by english artist norman wilkinson showing a single 
salmon leaping from a river has been combined with four 
featherwing salmon flies tied by spanish master belarmino martinez 
other fly tiers represented include carrie g stevens inventor 
of the gray ghost streamer lee wulff originator of the royal 
wulff dry fly and c jim prey creator of the thor steelhead 
pattern 
a photo of famed pensylvania angler jim leisenring is mounted 
with a set of 11 trout flies and the dogeared piece of paper on 
which he stored them complete with pencil notations about the 
flies 
cushners work has been displayed at the american museum of 
sports and the american museum of natural history in new york a 
collection of 230 pieces is been at the american museum of fly 
fishing in manchester vt 
the fly fishing museum and cushners workshop now occupy the top 
floor of his small twostory house now 75 cushner figures he has 
another 10 years to build up the collection and hopes to see the 
work continued by his soninlaw who lives nearby with cushners 
daughter and two grandchildren 
visitors to the museum are few so far it opened in may and 
not all of them understand what he is doing 
i had a man in here the other day who said he loved fishing so 
much you could put a bucket of water in front of him and he could 
fish all day said cushner yet with all this around him he 
wasnt interested fascinating

immigration and naturalization service has a strong case hes had 
21 felony convictions and spent six years in a florida prison for 
armed robbery since he left the army in 1970

to posttraumatic stress disorder and he hopes an immigration 
judge takes that into consideration at his july 21 deportation 
hearing 
he said the disorder which has been found in vietnam veterans 
and victims of violent crimes led him to heavy drug and alcohol 
abuse to escape flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights 
from his nine months in vietnam 
jackson wearing his silver and bronze stars and two purple 
hearts staged a small demonstration with family and friends 
outside the federal building here friday before heading for 
washington to join other veterans at the vietnam war memorial

of his friends said he is getting a raw deal 
there was a war going on and i thought i had an obligation to 
defend the country i was living in said jackson a slight man 
with a wispy moustache and a rash of blue tattoos on both arms who 
speaks with a hint of an accent

jackson his wife their baby and her young son live in a tough 
housing project in norwich on 628amonth disability payments from 
the army he will soon begin treatment at a posttraumatic stress 
unit at the veterans administration medical center in northampton

family emigrated to norwich an industrial city about 30 miles 
southeast of hartford he was shipped off to vietnam in january 
1968 as an infantryman with the 1st air cavalry division 
in may 1968 he said he was wounded when his squad was 
ambushed he recovered and was sent back into action and was 
wounded again with shrapnel jackson said he still cant get the 
episodes out of his mind 
i seclude myself i sort of live in my own prison he said 
im up and down looking out the windows all the time my wife 
tells me i check the perimeter all night 
after nine months in vietnam jackson said he was sent to fort 
benning ga 
he said he started drinking heavily and used marijuana 
barbituates and heroin anything that would make me pass out so i 
wouldnt have to face the flashbacks the army gave him a 
badconduct discharge later upgraded to an honorable discharge 
he did time in county jails in five or six states for 
drugrelated offenses and petty crimes before he held up a store in 
florida in 1979 when he got out of prison in 1985 the government 
renewed earlier efforts to deport him 
john weiss officerincharge of the ins office in hartford 
said resident aliens who have been convicted of two crimes 
involving moral turpitude are subject to deportation but would 
not comment on jacksons case 
robert d money of the international institute of connecticut 
inc jacksons legal representative said he believes there is a 
good chance jackson will be allowed to stay and jacksons

police fired tear gas and rubber bullets sunday 
to disperse hundreds of stonethrowing palestinians enraged by an 
israeli archaeological dig near one of islams holiest sites 
white clouds of tear gas hung over the biblical via dolorosa and 
other parts of jerusalems walled old city as the twohour battle 
raged 
at least 15 palestinians were injured including eight by tear 
gas five by beatings and two by rubber bullets said officials at 
jerusalems mukassad hospital several police officers were hit by 
rocks police officials said 
police said seven arabs were arrested and authorities later 
closed most schools in arab east jerusalem 
the protests began after israels religious affairs ministry 
launched a dig sunday to clear an ancient underground staircase 
near the temple mount a site sacred to both moslems and jews 
the temple mount known in arabic as haram al sharif or noble 
enclosure houses the dome of the rock and al aqsa mosques 
a crowd gathered and moslem religious leaders using 
loudspeakers called on arabs to defend the temple mount saying 
they feared the israelis would dig a passage to the mosques 
government officials said the dig would not violate moslem 
religious property 
massive police reinforcements were rushed to the old city and 
police blocked gates and streets leading to it 
dozens of palestinian youths some of them masked dashed from 
behind street corners to throw rocks police chased the crowd 
firing rubber bullets and tear gas 
an arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flowerprint 
dress covered with blood witnesses said she was hit with a rubber 
bullet 
the riot was one of the most widespread and violent in east 
jerusalem since the palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories started dec 8 at least 215 palestinians and four 
israelis have died in the uprising 
most of the occupied territories were quiet sunday but a 
firebomb set ablaze an army vehicle in downtown gaza city it was 
quickly extinguished and soldiers put the area under curfew 
in jerusalem government archeologist dan bahat said the dig was 
intended to open a stairway and clean up part of a more than 
2000yearold tunnel bordering the temple mount 
the temple mount is also bordered by the western wall the last 
remnant of the second temple and judaisms holiest site 
bahat said the 70yardlong tunnel links the wall with the via 
dolorosa which according to christian tradition was the route 
jesus took to the cross according to bahat and arab reports the 
call broadcast from the mosque claimed that the jews planned to 
dig a tunnel to the temple mount 
anwar kkatib deputy head of the moslem supreme council which 
administers the sites said moslem religious officials were aware 
of plans for the dig but opposed it 
bahat said the dig was started in coordination with the moslem 
authorities but uri mintzer spokesman for religious affairs 
ministry said moslem officials were not notified the work would 
start sunday 
jerusalems adviser on arab affairs amir cheshin said it was a 
mistake to start the dig without making a prearrangement with 
moslem authorities 
moslem and israeli officials decided later sunday to hold 
further talks about the excavation and cover up the dig for the 
time being 
moslems said they want the hole to remain closed zevulun orlev 
director general of the religious affairs ministry said he hoped 
the tunnel eventually could be opened as a tourist attraction

iran outgunned by iraq has to scrounge 
around the world for its military hardware because of a western 
arms embargo and western military analysts say it is short of 
aircraft tanks and artillery 
but when the war with iraq broke out in september 1980 irans 
armed forces were the bestequipped in the oilrich persian gulf 
region 
its air force for instance had 77 usbuilt f14 tomcats the 
only military force outside the us navy to have the advanced 
interceptors 
us officials said crewmen aboard the guided missile cruiser 
vincennes believed they were being attacked sunday by an iranian 
f14 when they downed an iranian passenger jetliner in the strait 
of hormuz iran said all 290 people aboard the iran air jetliner 
were killed 
at the outset of the iraniraq war iran also had 190 f4 
phantoms 166 f5 tigers and 205 usbuilt helicopter gunships 
they were purchased by prowestern shah mohammed reza pahlavi who 
was ousted in the 1979 islamic revolution 
now after nearly eight years of war and a chronic lack of spare 
parts military analysts estimate iran has 60 to 80 f4s and f5s 
and less than 10 operational f14s 
by comparison iraq has more than 500 combat aircraft supplied 
by the soviet union and france along with advanced missiles and 
laserguided bombs 
however reliable sources have reported the iranians have 
recently obtained some spares for the f14 and avionics for their 
f5s it is not clear to what extent this has helped their forces 
hardpressed to get its hands on spares for its usbuilt 
weapons the iranians have in recent years turned to china and 
north korea for hardware 
despite beijings denials that it supplies iran with weapons 
us military officials say china is now tehrans main arms 
supplier usually through north korea 
but the iranians are outgunned on the ground by iraq and by the 
us navy in the gulf 
in the two major naval clashes in the gulf april 18 and sunday 
the iranians have lost eight craft sunk or damaged 
but despite the americans vastly superior firepower the 
iranians are still considered a threat at sea 
they have several british or usbuilt destroyers and frigates 
although some are believed to be nonoperational and 610 
frenchmade kamaclass missiles boats

following is the text of the persian gulf 
briefing conducted by adm william crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff at the pentagon on sunday 
good afternoon after receiving further data and evaluating 
information available from the persian gulf we believe that the 
cruiser uss vincennes while actively engaged with threatening 
iranian surface units and protecting itself from what was concluded 
to be a hostile aircraft shot down an iranian airliner over the 
straits of hormuz 
the us government deeply regrets this incident 
a full investigation will be conducted but it is our judgement 
that based on the information currently available the local 
commanders have sufficient reasons to believe their units were in 
jeopardy and they fired in self defense 
the sequence of events commenced when the vincennes helicopter 
was fired upon by iranian surface units at 1010 am local gulf 
time for a correlation that was 210 am eastern daylight time 
approximately 40 minutes before the air action 
subsequently the vincennes identified the iranian firing units 
and closed to engage the iranian gunboats turned toward vincennes 
at high speed and were engaged at 1042 am with gunfire from the 
cruiser and the frigate albert b montgomery 
while so involved the vincennes detected an aircraft over iran 
at about 1047 am again local time this aircraft headed toward 
the vincennes and commenced closing at high speed the vincennes 
immediately began assessing this new threat 
the suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air 
corridor more importantly the aircraft headed directly for the 
vincennes on a constant bearing at high speed approximately 450 
knots a warning was sent on both military and civilian distress 
frequencies beginning at 1049 am this procedure was repeated 
several times but the aircraft neither answered nor changed its 
course 
there were electronic indications on the vincennes that led it 
to believe that the aircraft was an f14 there have been a number 
of f14 flights in the area over the last few days 
given the threatening flight profile and the decreasing range 
the aircraft was declared hostile at 1051 am local 
at 1054 am when the aircraft was about nine miles away 
the vincennes fired two standard surfacetoair missiles at 
least one of which hit at an approximate range of six miles due to 
the limited visibility the aircraft was not visually sighted until 
the missile impacted 
in understanding this incident it is important to appreciate 
the total context in which our ships operate the us government 
emphasized from the outset that committing military units to the 
persian gulf mission would involve risks and uncertainties this 
conclusion has been reinforced by several incidents for example 
the bridgeton mining the stark tragedy and the samuel b roberts 
mining 
a decision was made early in the commitment to give our 
commanders sufficient latitude to protect their people and 
equipment when hostile intent was manifested they do not have to 
be shot at before responding throughout our involvement in the 
persian gulf the iranian government has repeatedly threatened and 
fired upon us forces 
in september 1987 as a result of the attack on the uss stark 
and other incidents the united states issued a notice to airmen 
locally known as a notam which advised all aircraft in the persian 
gulf region that us navy ships were taking additional 
precautions and of the need to identify themselves and to state 
their intentions 
additionally they were advised that failure to respond to 
requests for identification and intentions or to warnings and 
operating in a threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk 
by us defensive measures 
as to the recent environment we have alerted our forces to 
indications that iranian units might attempt to carry out attacks 
against our forces over the july 4th holiday period 
we are still in the process of reconciling and collating all the 
data an official investigation of the incident will be conducted 
by rear adm william n fogarty united states navy of the us 
central command that concludes my statement

q admiral has there been contact with the iranian government 
and if not is any planned 
a there has not been direct contact no i think we will be 
awaiting the results of the sar effort and any other indications 
q have any orders been issued to change the mode of our 
operations in the gulf 
a no 
q admiral the aegis cruiser is supposed to be one of the most 
sophisticated in the fleet in determining threat how is it that it 
apparently misidentified this aircraft 
a im a little confused by your statement it is one of the 
most sophisticated ships we have and certainly the improvements 
made in aegis weapon system have greatly amplified our capability 
and im talking about the number of targets that we can track the 
ranges that we can detect a target the altitudes and our ability 
to detect and classify emanations from an aircraft but it has not 
solved all of our problems and it does not defy the laws of 
physics and one of the most difficult problems is from a radar 
blip particularly from a head on target to identify the type of 
aircraft and so forth i repeat for you that the people in the 
command center and the people operating the radar had about four 
minutes from the time they picked this target up until it was 
declared hostile that alone is a severe constraint 
q but what lead them to believe that it was an f14 echo 
a some other electronic information which is classified and 
im not willing to discuss 
q was the airliner squawking as it should be with its iff 
two did the airliner have the right to be where it was and what 
was your judgment was the skipper acting under the rules of 
engagement or was he a little bit impetuous here 
a let me do it in reverse order if i could please it is my 
judgment on the information that is available to us that the 
commanding officer conducted himself with circumspection and 
considering the information that was available to him followed his 
authorities and acted with good judgment in a very trying period of 
time and under very trying circumstances let me repeat that not 
only was he following this aircraft and was he concerned about it 
he was engaged on the surface with iranian units at the time the 
aircraft was not in the the air corridor that it would normally be 
in but the air corridor has a limited amount of air space and he 
was outside of that whether that is a factor i dont know at this 
point and what was your first one 
q the last one was whether his iff was squawking and whether 
it would have happened if the old rules of engagement were still in 
force 
a the old rules of engagement 
q if we hadnt changed the rules in september would he have 
held his fire the skipper 
a certainly the rules of engagement would not have been as 
specific in the authorities it granted him i dont know whether he 
would have or not under the old rules youre asking me about iff 
we did have some electronic emanations but i really cant say any 
more than that 
q but do you he didnt identify himself as a commercial or 
 
a no he did not 
q how come did he 
a now i should stress of course in that regard that we 
warned him on the civialian air distress net three times in these 
few minutes and four times on the military air distress net 
q saying we have you 
a yes we received no answers nor did he vary course or he 
did he indicate in his conduct in any way that he had received our 
communications 
q he was squawking something but not the recognizable i am 
an airliner 
a well it led us to believe that it was a military aircraft

if anybody is happy about the devastating 
drought that is parching the south and midwest it has got to be 
leslie skip stewartabernathy and steve masler 
stewartabernathy is the historical archaeologist for the state 
of arkansas for the past few days hes been having the time of his 
life delving into steamboat wrecks left high and dry by the 
receding river 
im trying to keep this in perspective stewartabernathy 
admitted during a weekend interview if all the farmers in 
arkansas go broke because of this drought its a major major 
disaster but for an archaeologist its a delight for several 
reasons 
one of the them is the chance to see centuryold steamboats up 
close 
we usually only get to see a little piece of these boats and 
then through a filter of dark river water said 
stewartabernathy who has been scrutinizing two wrecked steamboats 
and an old wooden barge on the arkansas side of the river just 
below memphis 
they are contained in an area about the size of two city 
blocks he said one of the boats is really large about 140 
feet long and 30 feet wide we havent identified it yet but we 
probably will 
masler director of the mississippi river museum in memphis has 
also been haunting the newly exposed river banks and the sandbar 
islands which have appeared as the mississippi dropped more than 20 
feet below normal during the drought 
masler has been busy photographing the river documenting what 
he believes is an event of historical importance 
its an exciting time he said in addition to the old 
wrecks some recent wrecks also have been found including a large 
threedeck diesel towboat it sank in more than 20 feet of water 
and now its totally exposed 
many people he said have been scouring the river banks for 
relics such as old bottles square nails and boiler bricks from 
steamboats 
im not collecting though he added im just 
documenting as far as collecting goes this situation is of much 
more value to the archaeologists 
stewartabernathy who works for the arkansas archaeological 
survey said several excavation teams would be working on the 
wrecks while the water is low 
well be taking measurements and noting construction 
techniques and so forth you must remember there were no 
blueprints for these old boats the people who constructed them 
knew what they were doing and they simply built them he said 
stewartabernathy said it wont be possible to remove the 
wrecked boats which have been attracting hordes of sightseers 
the wrecks are far too large and weigh far too much to be 
removed from the sites he said but the fact that they are 
uncovered at this time provides us a onceinalifetime 
opportunity really its thrilling to be able to examine these 
neat old boats and show them off to the public its an 
archaeologists dream come true

q was this an accident waiting to happen 
a you could in a sense of course characterize all combat 
operations as an accident waiting to happen we have said from the 
very outset of our involvment there that when youre using force 
when youre putting combat operations on to support your policy 
and it is a policy that is resisted and not agreed to by another 
party who is likewise willing to do things youre running risks 
weve never pretended otherwise we have been very successful with 
our using our strength to keep down these kinds of accidents and 
incidents i think that if we have contacted airliners before we 
have had them respond they have varied course that policy has 
been very successful and again i repeat if a country is going to 
wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a commercial 
airline in the area during that of course its an accident waiting 
to happen and if airliners do not pay attention to these 
instructions and guidance that we have put out and the warnings we 
put out then that poses a problem we do deeply regret the loss of 
life though 
q admiral would you imply that not only was this out of the 
air corridor and not responding to your signals but that you 
detected that it was losing altitude and gaining speed and flying 
over an area where combat activity was occurring in addition to 
all those irregularities concerning this aircraft have you been 
able to determine whether it took off on schedule as a normal 
commercial flight or are there any other irregularities 
a were trying to detect that or determine that right now i 
would like to emphasize your point for a moment f14 on 
corridors out of corridors the important points here are the 
commanding officer has a responsibility to protect his people his 
unit he is engaged already in a surface action he has a minimum 
amount of time it is logical to conclude that while he is firing 
and they are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from iran 
goes toward him steady course high speed decreasing altitude 
will not vary will not contact him its a more than logical 
conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy 
q admiral on the origination of the flight did it come from 
i dont know what city i missed that 
a we believe bandar abbas 
q it did thats a military base isnt it 
a no its joint civil and military 
q just let me finish with that you tracked that plane on 
takeoff 
a we dont know but maybe we did 
q is the first time an iranian commercial airliner has acted in 
this way 
a i dont have a specific example of where it has before we 
have multination airliners in the gulf in general our policy has 
been respected responded to occasionally we have an airliner that 
ignores it but usually they are at very high altitude the reason 
that these accidents are avoided mainly is that civilian airliners 
fly at very high altitudes and particularly because of that area 
this one did not 
q admiral the ship captains responsibility notwithstanding 
an f14 being an americanmade plane shouldnt it be one of the 
easier aircraft to identify especially stacking its information 
radiated against a fourengine commercial airliner 
a it depends on of course what it does and it depends on how 
much information you have on it it depends on the attitude which 
its flying it depends on the altitude it depends on the 
atmospheric conditions it depends on how much time youve got to 
process the data and unfortunately this has been the one of the 
major difficulties in the persian gulf from the outset were 
fighting in a lake and when flights come feet wet out of iran 
very few seconds no matter what 
q admiral arent comparisons going to made with this was the 
case of us mistaken identity and a commercial airliner was shot 
down the soviet union was a case of mistaken identity in korean 
oo7 what is the difference in your view between this shoot down 
and that one 
a i think there are two very fundamental differences there are 
probably a whole host of them with more thought but the 
fundamental differences are of course that it was not war zone 
there was not combat in progress there was not combat there 
normally and secondly the kal 007 was not warned in any way 
form or fashion nor was as far as i can tell or determine was 
any attempt made to to warn it was a very high altitude and 
even after the completion of the incident i dont think any claim 
was made that it was there to bomb or destroy it was accused of 
being an intelligence gatherer that was certainly not the case 
q admiral thank you very much admiral crowe

a newspaper disclosed sunday that the soviet 
airline aeroflot has experienced more than 50 attempted hijackings 
in the past 15 years only a few of the hijackings had been 
previously reported in the soviet media 
the article by the labor daily trud was believed to be the most 
complete report on air piracy in the soviet union to date 
trud quoted deputy aviation minister mikhail a timofeyev as 
suggesting the more than 50 attempts on the staterun airline could 
have been caused by strict regulations limiting emigration 
in western and developing countries he was quoted as saying 
hijackers basically were trying to solve their personal criminal 
or political problems 
in contrast statistics showed most soviet hijackers to be 
antisocial and criminal elements who are trying to escape 
responsibility abroad the newspaper quoted him as saying 
before soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or increased openness on some issues staterun media 
and officials often maintained that terrorism was exclusively a 
western problem that position has now changed 
in march the media reported extensively on the attempt by an 
11member siberian family of jazz musicians the ovechkins to 
hijack a jetliner bound for leningrad from irkutsk five of the 
hijackers three passengers and a stewardess were killed in the 
attempt 
airports are using tougher security measures but timofeyev was 
quoted as saying they do not guarantee safety from hijackings 
life shows that hijack attempts are still being made that 
there are people who are ready for terrorist acts practice shows 
that security systems dont always and everywhere work without 
fail he was quoted as saying

the sky but said he would not cut short his july fourth holiday 
weekend 
we dont expect him to come back early white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reagan whose statement was relayed by fitzwater called the 
accident a terrible human tragedy 
i am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper 
defensive action by the uss vincennes this morning in the persian 
gulf an iranian airliner was shot down over the strait of 
hormuz reagan said 
our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers crew 
and their families the defense department will conduct a full 
investigation reagan said we deeply regret any loss of life 
reagan defended the us action saying the civilian aircraft 
had headed directly for the vincennes while it was engaged in

the producer of this years jvc jazz festival 
says the 10day event went beyond our expectations and hes 
already looking ahead to next years program but it does get 
tougher and tougher each year 
im ecstatic about the reviews which have been totally fair 
and good said producer george wein they reviewed the music 
and not the sound system this year we seem to have solved the 
sound problem in carnegie hall that really hurt us last year 
the festival closed sunday 
in a festival of such magnitude where so many things can go 
wrong on a scale of one to 10 with 10 being perfect this year 
was 8 to nine last year was a six said wein 
wein feared the concurrent first new york international festival 
of the arts might smother the jazz festival but he says 
advertising for the arts festival which announced the jazz 
concerts increased gross sales over last year some 8 to 12 percent 
my problem is what do i do next year wein says last 
night i couldnt sleep trying to think of what im going to do 
next year 
jvc the japanese victor co maker of audio and video 
products is happy as sponsor well be back next year and jvc will 
be back with us well try to come up with a slightly new face next 
year 
wein reviewed some of the festivals events 
were really pleased with the love of louis armstrong 
program which opened the festival wein says and the fact that 
ella fitzgerald made an appearance was a highlight carlos 
santana and wayne shorter did an exciting event i thought one of 
the best things was miles davis who was better than ever kenny 
g did well the latin jam was a great success 
wein said he thought booking singer miki howard would be a risk 
but her concert was almost sold out two days beforehand 
shes a very good young singer were trying with her like we 
did with anita baker who became an instant star

sen dale bumpers said sunday he would have 
problems accepting an offer from likely democratic nominee michael 
dukakis to fill the vice presidential spot on the party ticket 
the arkansas democrat who is rumored to be under consideration 
for the no 2 job said his relunctance is rooted in the nature of 
the vice presidency 
every partys presidential nominee offers his running mate an 
opportunity to be a player but it never happens that way 
bumpers said 
ultimately the vice president gets lost in the shadows of the 
president 
in modern times it is a deadend street he said in an 
interview following a speech to the governors school at hendrix 
college 
bumpers told the crowd of more than 500 he had discussed the 
vice presidency with the dukakis campaign but he said speaking 
of vice president dont hold your breath on that 
he said the vice president is wed to positions taken by the 
president 
as george bush has learned the vice presidency gives you none 
of the pleasure and all of the guilt bumpers said 
the vice presidency is much like a me too position unless 
youre going to a funeral he said

the selection of arkansas gov bill clinton 
to deliver the speech nominating michael dukakis as the democratic 
presidential candidate shows the dukakis campaign is reaching out 
for southern support local political observers said sunday 
what i think gov clinton will be doing is hoping to mold a 
coalition said larry smith who teaches a politics course at the 
university of arkansas at little rock i think he was selected 
mainly because hes a southerner and this night is when we wave 
old glory 
clinton should address concerns that southern voters have 
about dukakis being a massachusetts liberal said david england 
a professor of political science at arkansas state university in 
jonesboro 
england said clinton can help clarify dukakis positions on 
national defense and nuclear weapons while stressing his fiscal 
conservatism in massachusetts 
that would help appeal to southern voters england said 
he could bring some of the politicos in the south in behind 
dukakis 
clinton should describe the massachusetts governors 
incredible burning compassion but shouldnt try to change his 
image as a technocrat said kip blakely executive director of the 
arkansas democratic party 
i wouldnt say thats a deficiency blakely said of dukakis 
image i think the people want someone whos steady 
clinton is to deliver the sole 15minute nominating speech for 
dukakis during the democratic national convention on july 20 
campaign officials announced saturday in boston 
lilburn carlisle chairman of the arkansas democratic party 
said clinton will be able to reveal insights into dukakis 
character 
i think he can convey to the american people what kind of man 
dukakis really is carlisle said and his speech will convey to 
the south how important this election really is 
clinton said saturday he hoped to introduce dukakis to millions 
of voters 
all the surveys show that a lot of people in the country dont 
know him very well and that a lot of the support for both 
candidates is still somewhat soft he said a lot of people are 
really going to be looking at him very closely for the first time 
in this convention 
however smith said most television viewers have already come 
to grips with who gov dukakis is through the long primary season 
i dont think gov clinton is going to be very effective in 
introducing gov dukakis to the american people 
michael hemphill associate professor of speech at the 
university of arkansas at little rock had this advice for clinton 
reinforce the strength of dukakis but dont expect to change 
many minds about dukakis

a handgunsafety group on sunday urged parents 
to take precautions to keep handguns away from their children 
especially at this time of year when children are off from school 
the center to prevent handgun violence a nonprofit group 
established in 1983 to educate americans about the risks of handgun 
ownership released a study that found that 38 percent of the 
unintentional shootings of children were either selfinflicted or 
inflicted by other children 
the study called childs play a study of 266 unintentional 
handgun shootings also found that an additional 41 percent of 
the guns used in shootings of children were owned by a friends 
parents or by relatives other than the victims parents 
the center studied 266 unintentional shootings of children that 
took place between january 1986 and may 1988 the shootings were 
either selfinflicted or inflicted by other children age 16 and 
under the center said it compiled its data from reports in the 
news media and in some cases followup conversations with police 
departments and hospitals 
peter shields chairman of the center recommended that parents 
either remove handguns from their homes or at the very least 
keep them unloaded and securely locked up 
shields also suggested that parents check with adults at other 
places where their children play to make sure that loaded guns are 
not easily accessible 
he added that children may be at particular risk of 
unintentional shooting during the summer because children arent 
in school and have more free time theyll be spending more time 
playing at their homes and those of friends and relatives

beginning this week it is easing limits on checking account 
withdrawals imposed when banks reopened may 9 after a twomonth 
closure 
starting monday customers will be able to withdraw 40 percent 
of the funds in their accounts up to a maximum of 20000 said a 
communique released by the national banking commission a 
government regulatory agency 
since may 9 customers have been permitted to withdraw only 25 
percent of their funds with a maximum of 10000 
the government closed 67 of the countrys 117 banks march 3 
after a run on deposits provoked by a political crisis 
large bank withdrawals began feb 26 the day gen manuel 
antonio noriega the countrys de facto ruler deposed president 
eric arturo delvalle a few hours after the president tried to fire 
the general 
a us freeze on 50 million of panamanian government money in 
the united states left the national bank of panama a commercial 
and central bank unable to cover the large withdrawals 
the bank closings reduced the economy to a cashonly system and 
shut down the countrys oncethriving international banking center 
which had attracted deposits from throughout the world 
particularly latin america 
after weeks of negotiations with private bankers banks reopened 
may 9 restrictions imposed then on withdrawals from savings and 
fixedterm accounts remain in effect 
in addition to the freeze on government funds the united states 
imposed other economic sanctions and sent additional troops to us 
bases in panama in an effort to force noriega to resign as head of 
the defense forces and leave the country noriega was indicted 
earlier this year on drug trafficking charges in miami

missiles antisubmarine rockets five 1inch gun four fixed 
torpedo tubes and one phalanx system 
the standard missile fired at the iranian plane is described 
by the pentagon as one of the most reliable in the navys 
inventory it is designed for use against missiles ships and 
aircraft the range and speed of the 14foot 7inch weapon are 
classified 
the iranianoperated usmade f14 tomcat fighter that the 
pentagon originally said approached us forces was one of the most 
advanced american weapons when sold to iran in the 1970s only 
about 10 of the scores of f14s sold to iran are thought to be 
operational the commander of us forces in the region marine 
corps gen george b crist told reporters last thursday that iran 
had recently received more f14 spare parts from an undisclosed 
source and had stationed some of the warplanes at bandar abbas an 
iranian navy base near the mouth of the persian gulf 
f14 fighters in the us arsenal and those originally sold to 
iran were equipped with phoenix missiles a 13footlong weapon 
that can travel faster than 3040 mph and has sophisticated 
tracking devices for targets up to 104 nautical miles distant us 
officials say they are unsure whether the iranian f14s are armed 
with phoenix missiles 
none of irans silkworm antiship missiles were reported to be 
involved in the fighting sunday in the persian gulf but the 
weapon which carries a deadly 1000pound warhead is a main 
concern of us forces there crist told reporters on thursday that 
the vincennes had been stationed near the mouth of the gulf to 
protect shipping against silkworms that may be stationed later this 
year in a concrete and earth bunker under construction at 
kuhestak crist said iran is believed to have about 20 
chinesemade silkworms at bandar abbas a permanent battery at 
kuhestak armed with the 57milerange missiles could hit 
anything moving in and out of the gulf he said the vincennes was 
under orders to protect any merchant vessel threatened by the 
silkworms he said 
the boghammer the type of speedboat that the vincennes and the 
montgomery were fighting is manufactured by sweden as a pleasure 
boat the vessel about 43 feet long has been modified with a 
heavy engine to give it great speed and equipped with machine 
guns rocketpropelled grenades and other weapons for use by irans

delegates to the american federation of 
teachers called sunday for curbs on standardized testing of 
kindergarten children and endorsed their leaders call for radical 
reforms in running schools 
but on the issue of reform they amended the original resolution 
proposed by the afts executive council to add a call for more 
money to raise teacher salaries and school budgets 
gail gordon a jersey city nj college professor argued 
its very important to link the reform with adequate funding if 
we dont do that well just be saying a lot of words without any 
teeth to back it up 
the 3000 delegates also called for higher taxes on families 
earning more than 75000 a year to help close the federal deficit 
and pay for social programs they rejected an amendment seeking 
cuts in pentagon spending 
the delegates heard aft president albert shanker open the 
convention saturday with a warning that public schools will 
collapse unless teachers find new and better ways to educate 
children 
shanker reiterated his call for experiments in a thousand or 
more districts where groups of six or more teachers would be given 
a green light to set up schools within schools run by teams of 
teachers without interference from central office bureaucracies 
the resolution adopted sunday said much that has happened as 
a result of education reform is bad it said more and more 
teachers are being told what to do when to do it and how 
oldfashioned teacher proofing in the name of reform 
it said the union will encourage its locals to find ways to 
enable any group of qualified teachers in abuilding to create a 
different type of public school these experimental schools would 
be voluntary for both teachers and parents they would be subject 
to both union and school board approval 
shanker suggests team teaching approaches and wider use of 
technology to free teachers from lecturing and allow students to 
advance at their own pace 
gordon a jersey city state college associate professor of 
health sciences said she was concerned that new jersey gov thomas 
kean has pushed reforms without adequate support for ongoing 
school programs 
victor gallis president of the patchoguemedford congress of 
teachers in new york said theres no way we can make the kinds 
of revolutionary and very necessary changes unless additional 
funding is available 
on kindergarten testing the aft criticized georgias new law 
requiring children to pass a standardized test to enter first 
grade it said such tests can at best offer only a snapshot 
representation of a childs skills 
it said using standardized tests to decide whether a child is 
ready to enter or exit kindergarten can be harmful to young 
children expecially the disadvantaged 
but the delegates accepted an amendment from sandra feldman 
president of new yorks united federation of teachers supporting 
tests if parents and teachers agree to them and if teachers have 
the final say on promotion 
feldman said tests can help detect handicaps in young children 
on the pentagon thomas y hobart an aft vice president from 
albany ny questioned whether we in this room are able to 
establish exactly what is the level that is necessary for the 
common defense of this country 
we do not want to indiscriminately cut the defense spending 
and say its to go to the schools said hobart 
the amendment to cut the military was defeated by voice vote 
the 677000member aft part of the aflcio has traditionally 
taken a more hawkish stance on the military and foreign affairs 
than its rival the national education association 
the union also voted to seek increases in federal programs to 
help innercity school districts 
it presented a human rights award to marian wright edelman 
president of the childrens defense fund and announced a drive to 
alert innercity parents to the importance of getting their 
children immunized the drive is cosponsored by lederle 
laboratories of new jersey

a us navy ship shot down an iranian 
jetliner over the persian gulf on sunday and iran said all 290 
people aboard were killed the united states said its forces 
mistook the jet for a warplane 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi said the incident showed 
that the us had entered a more direct war with our nation 
and he warned it must face the consequences of this criminal 
act 
irans official islamic republic news agency said the iran air 
jet was hit by two american missiles minutes after leaving iran for 
dubai in the united arab emirates all the passengers were believed 
killed after the plane exploded in the sky at an altitude of 
7500 feet irna said the report was monitored in nicosia cyprus 
iranian television showed helicopters shooting flares across the 
crash area and small motor boats moving in to pick up floating 
corpses it said 110 had been recovered 
a camera zeroed in on a rescue ship on the ships deck a 
rescue worker held up the corpse of an infant shook his fist 
the report said the victims included 66 children iran declared 
july 4 a day of mourning 
president reagan said the shooting occurred during proper 
defensive action after the jet headed for the uss vincennes as 
the ship was engaged in a battle with iranian gunboats in the 
strait of hormuz the entryway to the gulf he promised a full 
investigation 
we deeply regret any loss of life reagan said from camp 
david 
musavi warned the united states that its latest crime against 
the iranian people would only further arouse the abhorrence of 
iranians against washington according to irna 
the report did not say what actions iran might take it said the 
shooting would strengthen iranian resolve to continue its war with 
iraq 
iraq had no immediate comment on the incident 
irna said eyewitnesses on hengham island and iranian military 
forces in the persian gulf all clearly saw the passenger plane hit 
by two surfacetoair missiles fired by the american warships 
the jet iran air flight 655 was on a routine 150mile flight 
between irans coastal city of bandar abbas and dubai across the 
gulf in the united arab emirates irna said 
the gulf air corridor is one of the worlds busiest despite the 
hazards of flying over the waterway where iran and iraq have been 
at war for nearly eight years 
irna said the jet left bandar abbas at 1015 am 245 am 
edt and crashed at 1030 am the casualty toll of 290 would make 
it the sixthworst commercial air crash in history 
the pentagon said the gulf skirmish began at 210 am when the 
cruiser vincennes and the frigate elmer montgomery encountered 
iranian patrol boats in the strait of hormuz the elmer montgomery 
had been involved in an encounter with iranian gunboats saturday 
night 
iran claimed its naval forces shot down an american helicopter 
and that two iranians were missing in addition to those killed in 
the air crash us sources in the gulf said an american helicopter 
was fired upon but they did not acknowledge irans claim that it 
was shot down 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
emphasized that the american troops acted with good judgment 
he told reporters at the pentagon that the american ships fired 
only after sending warnings to the incoming aircraft the missile 
that hit the jet came from the vincennes he said 
crowe said the vincennes crew believed it was firing at an 
iranian f14 fighter jet 
how could a sophisticated warship like the vincennes mistake 
an airliner for a military jet thats the question that 
everybodys asking said one military source in the gulf who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the 9600ton vincennes the first of the navys billiondollar 
superpowerful aegistype cruisers to be assigned to gulf duty has 
been on patrol in the hormuz area for the past month it is 
equipped with an array of missiles including the sm2 standard a 
potent longrange antiaircraft weapon 
the incident underscored the danger faced by us warships in 
the gulf 
on may 17 1987 the us frigate stark was hit in the gulf by a 
missile fired by an iraqi warplane and 37 crew members died iraq 
said the attack was a mistake and reagan said at that time that 
such a mistake must never be repeated 
the incident also evoked memories of the sept 1 1983 incident 
in which a soviet fighter shot down a south korean airliner with 
269 people aboard after it strayed into soviet airspace all aboard 
were killed 
in addition israel destroyed a libyan arab airlines jet over 
the thenoccupied sinai desert on feb 21 1973 killing 106 of the 
113 people on board 
the us policy in the gulf was recently expanded to allow 
american warships to aid tankers of any flag that come under attack 
and ask for help it used that new power for the first time late 
saturday when the elmer montgomery came to the aid of a danish 
supertanker under attack by three iranian speedboats 
the officials said there were no american casualties in sundays 
clash the second major one between us and iranian forces in the 
gulf in three months 
on april 18 american warships and planes retaliating for the 
mining of a us missile frigate destroyed two iranian oil rigs 
and sank or disabled six of irans naval craft including two of 
its best frigates

their garbagepacked house and garage in a middleclass 
neighborhood were uncovered last month 
i always thought well ill get to it ill get to it 
she said 
a few years ago mrs eggert said she began to feel hopeless 
about ever changing her life she did less and less housekeeping 
i guess you kind of get to a point where you give up said 
eggert im having a hard time understanding how it did happen 
but i remember feeling there wasnt anything i could do about it 
when i went into the house i just blanked the mess out of my 
mind 
now the eggerts are trying to understand how they allowed their 
lives to run utterly out of control 
the couples four children are living in two foster homes mrs 
eggert 34 has changed her name and taken refuge in a safe 
house for abused women eggert 42 has checked himself into the 
psychiatric unit of a hospital 
and their home has been condemned and and boarded up 
in the months before the house was discovered the entire family 
slept on a single set of bunkbeds clean clothes were stored in the 
closet and stuffed into bureau drawers a clear path led to the 
beds through putrid piles of soiled diapers garbage and plastic 
bags of trash 
without running water for the past two years the eggerts washed 
their clothes at a laundromat they carried home jugs of water from 
a gas station or nearby brewery they stood in a plastic baby tub 
and poured water over themselves to wash they went to the bathroom 
in plastic trash bags 
the kids asked about it at first said eggert who was laid 
off two years ago by the citys parks department they wanted to 
know why the house was getting dirty i guess i told them it was 
going to get better but it got worse 
several times he said they attempted cleanups once he called 
a disposal company but they couldnt afford the cost of a trash bin 
the eggerts said they realize their children suffered 
i hate myself for it eggert said it kept the kids from 
doing a lot they should have been able to do 
i know they have got to have anger not being able to have 
friends in and having this horrible secret that they kept too 
mrs eggert said 
the house was discovered when mrs eggert didnt show up at her 
nursing home job one day and authorities went to the house to check 
on her she has started a new job hoping one day get her children 
back 
im beginning to take control of my life and it feels good 
she said but it is hard ive lost everything i ever had and i 
feel like its me again having to be the responsible one moving 
ahead 
eggert is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to a charge 
of domestic assault against his wife and is thinking about entering 
an intensive longterm treatment program 
when this happened i realized i needed help he said i 
figured this was the place to come but until you realize yourself 
that you need help you dont get it and by the time i did finally

introduced the measure after seeing lewd bumper messages once too 
often ill worry about whether its constitutional later 
bellas bill would limit to oneeighth of an inch high and wide 
the letters used for six specific words describing bodily 
functions body parts and sex acts 
this is not a joke bella a republican told the house of 
representatives when initial debate on his bill drew laughter from 
his colleagues i am just getting tired of seeing things like 
this attached to cars my daughter my granddaughter has to see 
this filth 
other lawmakers and a representative of the american civil 
liberties union questioned the constitutionality of the bill which 
gained final legislative approval friday 
when you start limiting freedom of expression you are 
starting problems said rep arthur morrell a democrat you 
dont need a law like this well be the laughingstock of the 
nation 
gary clements a spokesman for the aclu told a senate committee 
the legislation would be challenged in court we have a situation 
of trying to define what obscene is he said in practical 
terms its never been defined 
violators could be fined 200 for a first offense a second 
offense could result in a fine of up to 350 while subsequent 
violations would carry fines of up to 500 
roemer said a quick review of the bill did not show any 
obvious constitutional problems i will sign it he said 
however the governor said he might change his mind if his staff 
attorneys decide that all the flags are up and its obviously 
unconstitutional 
louisiana is not the first state to try to restrict offcolor 
messages on vehicles 
in georgia a law barring bumper stickers containing profane or 
lewd comments went into effect friday violations can draw fines of 
up to 100 
alabama enacted a law last year barring obscene bumper stickers 
from the highways but a federal court declared it unconstitutional 
after a truck driver was ticketed 
florida lawmakers passed a bill that would group obscene bumper 
stickers into a law that covers other obscene media such as comic 
books movies magazines and records 
the tennessee legislature passed a bill earlier this year that 
outlaws the display of obscene or patently offensive bumper 
stickers signs or other markings on a vehicle violators are 
subject to fines up to 50 
earlier in the louisiana legislative session bella said he 
liked the idea of an outright ban but questioned whether it would 
pass court muster bella said he thinks the size limitation is 
constitutional 
thats why i amended it the bill so many times to get it in 
the position i wanted it in he said 
clements said courts are historically reluctant to allow states 
the right to restrict expression through prior restraint 
were not in favor of corrupting children said clements 
but we see it as a dangerous precedent 
id be a wealthy man if i had a dollar for every lawmaker who 
had told me that they agreed with the aclu position that a bill is 
unconstitutional but they were going to vote for it anyway he 
said 
clements also said the bill would give a black eye to the 
states image 
the way people are looking at it across the country there 
goes louisiana again he said

us relations with iran have been frigid in 
the decade since a revolution toppled prous shah mohammed reza 
pahlavi and ended what president carter had called a close 
friendly relationship between the two countries 
the shahs departure from iran in january 1979 was followed by 
the return from exile and rise to power of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini leader of irans 32 million shiite moslems and of the 
religious opposition 
on nov 4 1979 militant iranian students overran the us 
embassy in tehran after a threehour struggle taking 100 hostages 
including 62 americans the students demanded extradition of the 
shah who was undergoing cancer treatment in new york city so he 
could be tried in iran as a war criminal 
that idea won swift support from khomeini who called on the 
students to act against the great satan america but carter 
refused the extradition request 
carter tried throughout his tenure to gain release of the 
hostages but 52 of them remained captive for 444 days and didnt 
win their freedom until jan 20 1981 just hours after president 
reagan was sworn in to office 
officials from the two nations have met since then at 
conferences held by international organizations and had contact in 
the hague netherlands where the usiran claims tribunal was 
formed to disentangle the countries economic ties 
but not since 1981 have they had official highlevel talks on 
bilateral issues 
however it was revealed during the irancontra hearings that 
the reagan administration had conducted secret talks with the 
iranians in 1985 and 1986 and sold them arms in an effort to build 
better relations and to win the release of hostages from captors in 
lebanon over whom iran was believed to have influence 
reagan has barred further arms sales but also has said the 
united states would be willing to talk with the iranians to get 
them to moderate their policies 
tensions with iran flared again in the past year as hostilities 
increased in the persian gulf region where iran and iraq have been 
at war since 1980 
the united states began escorting kuwaiti tankers flying the 
american flag through the tense gulf in july 1987 
on the first us convoy through the gulf the reflagged kuwaiti 
tanker bridgeton hit a mine us officials have accused iran of 
laying the mines that damaged the bridgeton and the uss samuel b 
roberts last april 
after the roberts was damaged the united states retaliated by 
destroying two of irans persian gulf oil platforms in the ensuing 
conflict us forces sank or damaged four iranian attack boats and 
disabled two frigates 
iran responded with attacks on arab oil facilities and us 
british and cypriot commercial vessels 
on sunday a us navy missile cruiser shot down an iranian 
passenger jetliner that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft 
tehran radio called the american destruction of the iranian 
jetliner new evidence of american crimes and mischiefs crimes 
which expose americas nature more than ever before

a un special envoy said sunday he has 
presented concerned parties with a comprehensive plan for peace in 
cambodia and had achieved general agreement to work toward a 
settlement 
un envoy rafeeuddin ahmed said he gave a working paper for the 
plan to thai foreign minister siddhi savetsila for distribution to 
foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian nations 
ahmed was scheduled to meet with the asean ministers before they 
open their annual meeting monday 
the situation has evolved in a direction where there is 
general agreement among all the parties in reaching a settlement 
ahmed said in an interview 
he confirmed the document called for an international 
peacekeeping force and that such forces should monitor ceasefires 
and withdrawals of troops but he declined to disclose any further 
details 
he said that in the past few days he also gave copies of the 
plan to vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach cambodias 
prime minister hun sen and the antivietnamese resistance a 
coalition of three guerrilla groups led by prince norodom sihanouk 
which includes the khmer rouge 
the communist khmer rouge defeated a usbacked government in 
1975 and according to some estimates killed 3 million cambodians 
before they were toppled by the vietnamese invasion of 1978 
the intensified search for a political settlement appears to 
have been sparked by fears from several sides that the khmer rouge 
could return to power 
ahmed said he will soon distribute the working paper to the un 
security council and indicated it would be involved in guaranteeing 
a settlement 
ahmed declined to elaborate on how the different parties reacted 
to the document but said they have all indicated their interest 
and they have asked the un secretarygeneral to continue his 
efforts referring to javier perez de cuellar 
all sides would have to make concessions if we are going to 
reach a solution there has to be give and take he said 
ahmeds recent meeting in cambodia with hun sen was the first 
time the envoy visted phnom penh he has been involved in seeking a 
cambodian settlement since 1982 
the meeting also marked the first formal talks on the issue with 
the vietnameseinstalled government which the united nations does 
not recognize 
hun sen flatly rejected the idea of an international 
peacekeeping force after it was earlier proposed by sihanouk at a 
news conference in phnom penh wednesday hun sen said it was 
nonsense to replace one foreign force the departing 
vietnamese with another foreign force 
vietnam has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from 
cambodia by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50000 troops 
and withdrawn top military command 
ahmed said it will take some time for the different parties to 
give final reactions to the document he said it may provide some 
input for the informal talks scheduled for july 25 in indonesia 
the sihanoukled coalition and vietnam have already agreed to 
take part in the talks but there has been no final word from the 
prohanoi government in cambodia 
the official cambodian news agency spk said friday that hun sen 
received an invitation but did not say whether the government would 
attend

ridding cambodia of the vietnamese and 
khmer rouge likely will dominate discussions this week among 15 
foreign ministers and other senior officials from asia north 
america and western europe

began a partial withdrawal of 50000 troops from cambodia last week 
amid fears that a power vacuum in that country could be filled by 
the khmer rouge guerrillas 
they precede informal talks in jakarta indonesia on july 25 
among cambodian combatants the informal talks are aimed at finding 
a political solution to the conflict which began in 1978 ago when 
hanois forces invaded that country 
the cambodian problem is likely to be dramatized by the presence 
at some meetings of prince norodom sihanouk the charismatic leader 
of a threeparty antivietnamese coalition 
the six foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian 
nations will hold their 21st annual meeting through wednesday it 
will be followed by sessions between asean and close supporters

state george p shultz hansdietrich genscher west germanys 
foreign minister and the foreign ministers of australia canada 
japan new zealand and greece 
thailand indonesia malaysia brunei singapore and the 
philippines are members of asean which was founded in 1967 
the officials are likely to review several recent plans for 
peace in cambodia including ones from the sihanoukled coalition 
china and the united nations 
all the plans call for the total withdrawal of vietnamese 
forces which hanoi has promised by 1990 most stress the need for 
an international peacekeeping force to prevent armed takeover by 
any one of the warring cambodian sides 
the khmer rouge which imposed a reign of terror on cambodia 
form the most powerful group within the sihanouk coalition and are 
viewed as superior to the forces of the peoples republic of 
kampuchea the prohanoi government in cambodia 
on sunday special un envoy rafeeuddin ahmed said he has given 
the un plan to end fighting to all combatants and each has 
expressed interest ahmed said there is general agreement among 
vietnam cambodia and the three rebel groups for a settlement 
but he declined to give details of his plan 
the khmer rouge were in power in cambodia in 19751978 
according to some reports up to 3 million of cambodias 8 million 
people died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest 
the united states and other dialogue partners are expected to 
push strongly for strategies that would deny access to power by the 
khmer rouge 
the asean ministers in turn are expected to press the united 
states canada australia and france the main refugee 
resettlement countries to accept more indochinese and help stop 
the recently increased flow of boat people from vietnam

a kuwaiti panel on sunday said lax security 
measures at bangkok airport facilitated the april hijacking of a 
kuwaiti airliner en route from the thai capital to kuwait 
in a report submitted to the cabinet of ministers the committee 
headed by justice minister dhari abdullah alothman also said 
insufficient security measures taken by the kuwaiti interior 
ministry and the kuwaiti airways corporation helped the hijackers 
to commit their crime 
despite the fact that the committee was unable to determine 
how the hijackers managed to smuggle their arms into the plane the 
lax security measures at bangkok airport have undoubtedly 
facilitated the crime to take place minister of state for 
foreign affairs rashed abdelaziz alrashed told reporters 
he said a second committee had been formed to deal with 
implementing the reports recommendations 
moslem shiite hijackers seized the kuwait airways boeing 747 
april 5 beginning a 16day ordeal during which they killed two 
passengers 
the plane was taken to mashdad in northeastern iran then to the 
mediterranean island of cyprus and finally to algeria where the 
hijackers surrendered and were given safe conduct 
the hijackers were demanding the release of 17 islamic militants 
imprisoned in kuwait

convention we believe that democracy can be reinstated once 
again in chile 
verdugo president of the 100000member colegio de profesores 
de chile is on parole awaiting sentencing from his arrest two 
years ago for leading protest strikes 
verdugo who needed a ruling from the chilean supreme court to 
leave the country to deliver his speech here said today is a 
historic moment for the teachers union movement in chile 
verdugo addressed the 3000 delegates in spanish a translator 
repeated his remarks 
he said his countrymen were commited to a peaceful movement to 
rid chile of the government of gen augusto pinochet 
after 12 years of lack of freedom to do anything we feel that 
there will never be any change to benefit education or any 
chilean if we cannot first overcome the pinochet regime he 
said 
verdugos union is leading a campaign for a no vote on a 
plebscite expected this fall that would give pinochet eight more 
years in power

before you to share what we are going through in my country

for giving us the opportunity of being here said verdugo 
our fight is not only a fight for the teachers its not only 
a fight for education it is really a fight to try to recoup and 
recover our democracy in chile he said 
with your help and solidarity and support we will win the 
battle he concluded to a standing ovation 
aft president albert shanker said it is hard for any one of 
us to imagine how much courage it takes to do what oswaldo verdugo 
has done 
shanker said that when he visited chile last october as part of 
an international delegation they visited a cemetery to pay our 
respects to other union leaders who tried to take on the regime in 
the last few years 
a yes vote would extend pinochets rule for eight years a no 
vote could lead to an open election for president by march 1990 
verdugo who spent 50 days in jail in 1986 said afterwards he 
was unsure what he will do next on his american visit i know 
only that i have to be back in chile by july 15 he said

a un special envoy on sunday urged 
members of the afghan resistance to turn to their traditional local 
councils in forming a government after the departure of soviet 
troops from afghanistan 
diego cordovez who negotiated the april 14 geneva accord under 
which soviet troops are withdrawing from afghanistan leaves 
tuesday for the afghan capital of kabul there he is expected to 
meet with president najib to try to negotiate a coalition 
government which would include the moslem rebels 
but the sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in 
this northwestern pakistani city has voted to boycott cordovez 
efforts despite opposition from a more moderate faction the 
alliance has rejected any coalition government with afghanistans 
ruling marxist government which the usbacked rebels are 
fighting 
we would never accept a coalition government with the 
communists said mahmood hasrat an afghan elder who spoke on 
behalf of about 200 refugees who met with cordovez in a tent 
we will fight until the last soviet soldier and the communist 
regime of president najib leaves afghanistan said hasrat he 
echoed guerrilla charges that the geneva accord did not bring peace 
to afghanistan because the resistance was not involved in the 
negotiations 
cordovez pleaded with the rebels to turn to a solution that 
will have the legitimacy to gather the kind of support you need now 
to have a government acceptable to all afghan people 
the peshawarbased afghan resistance has said that the moslem 
rebels will hold elections within 90 days in afghanistan and in

president reagan declared sunday that the us 
downing of an iran air jetliner was a proper defensive action 
and pentagon officials said navy officers believed they were 
fending off an attacking iranian fighter that ignored seven 
warnings 
reagan called the incident a terrible human tragedy and 
said we deeply regret any loss of life the incident occurred 
on the second of two days of skirmishes between iran and the united 
states on oil lanes through the strait of hormuz at the mouth of 
the persian gulf 
the islamic republic news agency said the plane a commercial 
airbus carrying 290 people from the iranian port of bandar abbas to 
dubai was hit by two us missiles and that all aboard were 
presumed dead 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
there had been a visual sighting as the missiles hit the craft and 
that eyewitnesses had seen the craft disintegrate he said the 
incoming craft had not been visually identified when the missiles 
were fired but defended the commander who he said ordered the 
firing in the belief his ship was in jeopardy 
crowe said it had been thought the incoming aircraft was an 
iranian f14 fighter the most lethal plane owned by iran 
the us ship which fired was the uss vincennes an aegis class 
cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles 
the airliner was four or five miles outside the commercial 
corridor between dubai and a joint civilianmilitary airfield at 
bandar abbas and flew directly at the vincennes as the us 
warship exchanged fire with several of irans boghammer gunboats 
said crowe 
the vincennes and a smaller us frigate the uss elmer 
montgomery firing 5inch guns sank two iranian patrol boats and 
damaged a third pentagon officials said the number of victims 
aboard the iranian boats was not known 
no american casualties were reported 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus was quick to react to the 
incident americas crime today in downing an iranian airbus is 
new evidence of american crimes and mischiefs crimes which 
expose americas nature more than ever before it said 
vice president george bush who has a lock on the republican 
presidential nomination learned about the incident during a 
conference call with reagan and other senior administration 
officials he had no immediate comment a spokeswoman said 
michael dukakis his likely democratic opponent in november 
said plainly our armed forces have a right to defend themselves 
when attacked 
he said however that the downing of the plane is further 
evidence that the war between iran and iraq must end we and the 
international community have a responsibility to stop it 
jesse jackson said it is not enough just to be sorry the 
us has been more than a year in the persian gulf and still there 
is no defined policy still no firm commitment to end the war 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he would reserve judgment until receiving further 
information 
another member of the committee sen carl levin dmich said 
that from what he knows so far it seems reasonable to believe 
that the us navy acted in an appropriate manner 
like others i too have many unanswered questions levin 
said ill reserve final judgment until i have more details 
the pentagon early sunday announced that the vincennes had shot 
down an iranian f14 but hours later sources told the associated 
press that military officials had come to believe the 
identification of the craft was wrong at 130 pm edt crowe 
appeared before reporters to say he now believed the downed 
aircraft was a civilian airliner 
as crowe spoke reagan in a statement read by spokesman marlin 
fitzwater promised a full investigation by the defense department 
reagan said the iran air jet was headed directly for the uss 
vincennes 
when the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings the 
vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized 
procedures firing to protect itself against possible attack 
reagan said in his statement 
crowe expressed deep regret over the loss of life but 
emphasized time and again that the military commanders in the 
persian gulf had acted with good judgment in that they believed 
american ships were being approached by a hostile aircraft 
as the aircraft approached the vincennes it dropped in altitude 
and accelerated to about 450 knots as a warplane would do if 
preparing to fire an antiship missile crowe said 
those actions and electronic transmissions led us to believe 
it was a military aircraft he said 
in the seven minutes between the detection of the aircraft on 
us radar and the firing of the missiles crowe said the us 
warship sent three warnings on a civilian distress network and 
four warnings on a military distress network 
the iranian aircraft neither answered nor changed its 
course he said there were electronic warnings on the 
vincennes that led it to believe the aircraft was an iranian 
f14 but which crowe described as classified and refused to 
discuss most civilian aircraft emit signals identifying themselves 
and monitor specific civilian radio frequencies 
when the iranian aircraft was about nine miles away the 
vincennes fired two standard surfacetoairmissiles at least one 
of which hit at an approximate range of six miles crowe said 
crowe said he did not intend to imply that iran sent the 
airliner into the combat zone on purpose but said if a countrys 
going to wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a 
commercial airliner in there during that of course its an 
accident waiting to happen 
an iranian f4 was sighted a few minutes later by us radar 
but did not approach the combat zone and no us warplanes were in 
the area he said 
the important points here are the commanding officer has a 
responsibility to protect his people his unit he is engaged 
already in a surface action he has a minimum amount of time 
crowe said it is logical to conclude that while he is firing and 
they are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from iran goes 
toward him steady course high speed decreasing altitude will 
not vary will not contact him its a more logical conclusion 
that he may very well be in jeopardy 
crowe noted that us forces had been alerted that the iranians 
might attempt to carry out attacks against our forces over the 
july fourth holiday period and that there had been a number of 
f14 flights in the area over the last few days 
in his statement reagan said i am saddened to report that it 
appears that in a proper defensive action by the uss vincennes this 
morning in the persian gulf an iranian airliner was shot down over 
the strait of hormuz 
fitzwater said reagan who was at camp david for the fourth of 
july weekend received a telephone call at 452 am edt from 
national security adviser colin powell who told him that us 
forces believed they had shot down an iranian f14 he received 
another update in writing at 811 am that noted the iranian claim 
that a civilian jetliner had been downed 
at 950 am he was told that the iranian allegations might be 
correct 
fitzwater said reagan had no plans to return to the white house 
before noon monday 
the only us interest in the persian gulf is peace and this 
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible 
speed reagan said 
on saturday the montgomery responded to a distress call from a 
danish merchant vessel the karama maersk that was being harassed 
by iranian gunboats in the strait of hormuz the pentagon said in a 
statement the montgomery dispersed the iranian craft with a 
warning shot believed to be the first exchange of fire since the 
united states sank an iranian frigate badly damaged a second and 
set fire to two iranian oil platforms last april

the uss vincennes destruction of an 
iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its 
captain and crew doing their duty members of the ships namesake 
organization said sunday 
on the basis of what we can find out on news reports the 
captain acted the best way he knew how said william e brooks 
jr publisher of the vincennes suncommercial newspaper and a 
member of the uss vincennes association 
the association is made up mostly of men who served on the two 
ships of that name during world war ii the current uss vincennes 
is the fourth naval vessel to bear the name of this southwestern 
indiana city 
the other thing in my opinon this is the other side of the 
stark incident brooks said referring to the may 1987 iraqi jet 
attack on the us missile frigate stark which cost 37 american 
lives 
if the captain had stayed there and not done anything we 
might have been reading about loss of life on the vincennes 
brroks said 
the islamic republic news agency said the iran air jet shot down 
was a commercial airbus carrying 290 people from the iranian port 
of bandar abbas to dubai the news agency said all aboard were 
presumed dead 
the two us missiles were fired by uss vincennes an aegis 
class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles 
the current 9600ton vincennes was the third in a new class of 
guided missile aegistype cruisers and was christened april 14 
1984 at pascagoula miss and commisioned on july 6 1985 
it was the fourth us navy ship to bear the name of vincennes 
the first was commissioned in 1826 and assigned to service in the 
pacific it was decommissioned in 1867 
association member gene thurmond 65 of evansville served on 
the second uss vincennes a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and 
sunk by japanese cruisers in 1942 
a light cruiser named for vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and 
received six battle stars for service in world war ii before it was 
decommissioned in september 1946 
thurmond said he met the captain of the newest ship capt will 
c rogers iii at an association meeting in vincennes in august 
i met the skipper last summer and hes a real captain and 
levelheaded and i think he did the proper thing he said 
the associations 500 members meet annually in vincennes to 
reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead 
said vincennes liaison officer and honorary member bill toth 64 
members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290 
people who were killed 
theres no way of rectifying this kind of situation so all we 
can do is remember these people toth said our prayers and 
those of the commuity are with the ships commander and crew 
members 
from what ive heard about the ship its like everybody on it 
is family and theyre trying to be the best in the navy toth 
said but as this incident shows that can be good and bad 
its a hard situation today until all the knews came in it 
was hard to really understand what happened over there said 
toth we have such a close tie to the ship and its personnel we 
regret the situation that happened as far as the civilians 
involved 
but the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was 
best for the personnel he added

the elvis presley memorial trauma center 
has received 100000 elvisinspired donations from as far away as 
tasmania since being named for the rocker in 1983 officials say 
that amounts to about half of the donations to the trauma 
center part of the regional medical center at memphis in that 
time 
the hospital receives a couple of presleyinspired contributions 
each week said marler stone director of development for the 
regional medical center at memphis foundation which raises money 
for the hospital 
it would be wrong to create the image that elvis fans 
worldwide are raising millions of dollars for the trauma center 
he said recently we naturally wish that were true 
about 50 fan clubs have donated to the hospital including 
groups in england brazil and tasmania said center spokeswoman 
linda brigance 
among them is the elvis presley burning love fan club which 
will have donated about 20000 to the trauma center by the end of 
this year said club president bill denight of streamwood ill

a former rooming house left over from an 
earlier era of catskill mountains summer tourism is the home of the 
ultratraditional catholic convent thats been disrupted by the 
puzzling story of a novice nun taken away by her family 
rising behind the aging rooming house that has housed the st 
josephs novitiate convent for four years are the still skeletal 
beginnings of a new novitiate what the rev clarence kelly calls 
a proper convent 
kelly said last week he doesnt envision any problems filling 
the new building although it would mean doubling the ranks of the 
fledgling order of the daughters of mary a group of nuns opposed 
to modernism and church reform 
weve had very encouraging signs he said 
kelly foresees growth in a brand of catholicism that isnt 
recognized by the local diocese doesnt accept the reforms of the 
second vatican council but endorses the ultimate infallibility of 
the pope 
members of the community perform all masses in latin and the 
sisters wear traditional long black habits unlike those of many 
orders that have accepted modern dress 
attention was drawn to socalled traditional catholicism 
last week when archbishop marcel lefebvre was excommunicated for 
defying the pope after years of fighting the satanic influence 
of modernism 
the st joseph novitiate itself was in the news last week when 
the family of a 22yearold novice nun until recently members of 
an ohio church affiliated with the convent came to the catskills 
and abducted the young woman 
although officials in new york issued arrest warrants for the 
womans father and brothers mary sue greve told officials in ohio 
after a fourday disappearance that she was not being held against 
her will 
kelly said he fears miss greve known at the convent as sister 
mary cecilia had been brainwashed by her family 
the convent is run by the st pius v association which also 
operates affiliated schools and churches on long island and in 
cincinnati and detroit it was during his involvement with those 
institutions that kelly saw a need for an unliberated convent 
situation he said in a recent interview 
there was always a pressing need to have sisters said 
kelly the convents spiritual adviser i received petitions from 
young women who wanted to become religious to become nuns but 
they could not find a traditional convent 
traditional means the way that religious congregations were 
before the changes of the second vatican council 23 years ago 
kelly said 
at the convent there are 10 postulants women who took a 
temporary vow of silence at the end of their first year of 
preparation for the sisterhood a secondyear novice and three 
professed nuns six other professed nuns teach at an affiliated 
school on long island 
the nuns follow a strict schedule with everyone rising at 530 
am attending several masses devotions and classes performing 
chores like lawn work and washing dishes and fulfilling one of the 
convents missions through a designated holy hour 
the sisters have as their primary work the work of consoling 
the heart of the son of god said kelly 
during this holy hour 5 pm to 6 pm every day but thursday 
when its 11 pm to midnight nuns try to make up for peoples 
indifference to christs sacrifices said kelly this duty fulfills 
the mission of st margaret mary described by kelly as a very 
obscure nun in an obscure convent in france 
he said women training to be nuns are free to leave the vocation 
at any time and are given many opportunities to do so during their 
nineyear training 
miss greves family kept her whereabouts a secret this has 
been tough on all of us mary sue is very upset one of her 
brothers said 
ohio officials quoted the greves as saying they took their 
daughter because they were upset by a lack of communication with 
the convent 
but kelly said the greves could have visited their daughter 
they didnt even avail themselves of all the opportunities they 
had to visit her 
he speculated on why the family took the young woman from the 
convent 
mrs greve does not want her pretty daughter to be a nun he 
said

meteorologists know that a stalled high 
pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in 
middle america but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena 
occurred and when they might end 
in a highpressure system also known as an anticyclone dry air 
gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise 
pattern around the center 
it is the opposite of a cyclone where rising moist 
counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds and thus

more like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battles 
in chicago 20 years ago or the lastditch floor fight that sen

nasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman four 
years ago that weakened walter f mondale almost on the eve of his 
nomination

democrats pointing to quick work on platform rules and

george bush was talking about crime and 
politics and democrats versus republicans sounding for all the 
world like the presidential candidate he is 
but something was missing there was no specific mention of his 
democratic rival michael dukakis the reason this new york 
speech was not a campaign trip it was a party building mission 
paid for by the gop 
the semantic distinction in which bush attacks liberals or 
democrats but not dukakis by name has allowed the vice president 
to take several trips on the republican party tab at a time when 
his own campaign funds are virtually gone

a government attempt to take control of the 
teamsters has dissolved a threedecade marriage of convenience 
between the nations largest union and the republican party while 
forging an unlikely alliance michael dukakis and sen orrin hatch 
to try and put in trusteeship a complete union like the 
international brotherhood of teamsters smacks of 
totalitarianism says hatch a conservative republican from utah 
who is an outspoken critic of unions but fervent defender of 
teamster president jackie presser 
its the kind of thing you would expect in russia not the 
united states hatch said of the governments suit last week 
branding the union corrupt and seeking to dethrone presser and 17 
other top teamster officers 
dukakis also condemned the justice departments use of the 1970 
racketeering influenced corrupt organization rico act to place 
the 16millionmember union under the supervision of a 
courtappointed trustee 
such an extreme remedy is fundamentally inconsistent with the 
very concept of independent and democratic trade unions he said 
in a letter to aflcio president lane kirkland 
dukakis who with union support has wrapped up the democratic 
presidential nomination said he would vigorously prosecute and 
seek to remove from office individual union leaders corporate 
executives or government appointees who misuse their jobs 
however i simply see no need to resort to an extreme legal 
approach that would unnecessarily deprive rankandfile union 
members of their right of selfgovernance he said 
equally ironic is what sen edward m kennedy dmass and vice 
president george bush have in common on the governments proposal 
to take over the teamsters neither has anything to say about it 
dont wait on us for a reaction said a spokesman for 
kennedy the liberal prounion chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee whose brother robert succeeded in 
putting both pressers father and former teamster president jimmy 
hoffa in jail 
bush declined a solicitation from labor leaders to all of the 
presidential candidates to criticize the governments anticipated 
takeover attempt when us attorney rudolph giuliani of manhattan 
was still putting the suit together 
new york rep jack kemp and former secretary of state alexander 
haig two onetime contenders for the gop nomination both eagerly 
responded to teamster pleas for support as did all of the 
democratic candidates 
with the biggest campaign war chest of any group in the country 
50 percent larger than the american medical associations this 
year teamster leaders for decades have danced with politicians 
from both parties while prosecutors pursued them in court 
lost in the glare of publicity over the teamsters support for 
republicans dwight eisenhower richard nixon and ronald reagan for 
the presidency was the flow of most of its money in congressional 
and state races to democrats 
in 1986 for example 87 percent of the teamsters campaign 
money in senate and house races went to democrats but with a 
political fund of 4 million two years ago and 6 million so far 
this year the union has plenty of cash to spread among members of 
both parties 
the majority of teamsters are probably democrats hatch 
said most of the people they endorse are democrats but that has 
nothing to do with the philosophical and legal approach being used 
here this is not what you do to free institutions in our society 
whether its the campaign dollars or the fact that one of every 
70 workers in the country is a teamster the union has no problem 
raising an outcry from politicians to counter the governments 
prosecutors 
prior to the filing of the suit last week in new york at least 
269 of the 535 members of congress signed letters to attorney 
general edwin meese iii condemning the suit as a precedent which 
strikes at the very foundation of government 
if the us government can move in and take over the teamsters 
union they can take over the united steel workers the first 
national bank any business any entity said sen paul simon 
dill a former democratic presidential contender 
pressers indictment in 1986 on embezzlement charges fractured a 
teamster alliance with republican administrations and presidential 
candidates dating back to the middle 1950s 
but teamster presidents have been indicted before three of the 
last four of them under republican administrations and the wounds 
have always healed by the time the next presidential election came 
around 
however when leaks to the press about the governments takeover 
suit began surfacing a year ago the teamsters abandoned any 
lingering notion of cutting their own deal this year with the gop 
against the democratic leanings of the rest of the labor movement 
anticipation of the suit and reports that three more just like 
it were being prepared against the laborers international 
longshoremans association and the hotel and restaurant workers 
helped catalyze a reunion of the teamsters and the aflcio last 
october after a 30year rift 
the future will hold that the teamsters union being back in 
the aflcio joining forces together are going to create the 
greatest political giant this country has ever seen presser said 
then 
the aflcio is forgoing an official presidential endorsement 
this year until after the republican national convention in august 
when it will convene and formally poll the presidents of its 91 
affiliated unions 
but like many other union chiefs weldon mathis who is acting 
as the teamsters president while presser recovers from brain and 
lung surgery for cancer has spoken favorably of dukakis 
the bloom was off the lily a long time ago with the reagan 
administration and the republican party said one senior teamster 
official well take our lead from the aflcio

when thousands of general electric co workers 
across the nation vote on a proposed threeyear contract later this 
week one union will urge approval of the contract but call it 
inadequate at the same time 
members of the pittsburghbased united electrical radio and 
machine workers of america ue which claims a membership of 
9400 and the washington dcbased international union of 
electronic salaried technical and furniture workers iue which 
has about 40000 members will vote on the contract wednesday and 
thursday ue union spokesman peter gilmore said saturday 
the unions represent ge production and maintenance workers 
nationwide their last contract expired june 30 
after meeting to discuss the proposal friday the ue voted to 
recommend acceptance rather than call for a strike because of 
disagreement among the leadership of the iue gilmore said 
he said some iue negotiators recommended acceptance of the 
proposal and others called for rejection some executive boards of 
major iue locals voted to approved it while others rejected it he 
said 
under the current circumstances an effective nationwide 
strike against ge is impossible the union said in a written 
statement while we firmly believe the companys offer is 
inadequate we cannot lead our members into a long strike that has 
virtually no chance of success because of the lack of unity 
the agreement was reached june 26 between the company and the 
two unions which are the largest of the 14 ge unions and the only 
ones to negotiate national contracts the other 12 with a combined 
membership of about 20000 also were represented on the 
negotiating team gilmore said 
its a very modest agreement with minimal increases in wages 
and costofliving adjustments he said workers would lose in 
other areas including medical insurance nightshift pay and wages 
for newlyhired workers he said 
lessons learned from a 102day strike in 1969 show that it 
takes total unity of all unions in ge to take this company on and 
win the ue statement said 
ge thinks the agreement is fair said spokesman jack batty who 
works at the companys fairfield conn headquarters 
we believe that its a good contract and that once the union 
membership understands it they will ratify it batty said 
the agreement calls for three wage increases 25 percent this 
year 15 percent in 1989 and 15 percent in 1990 plus a 165 cash 
payment in july 1988 and a 900 payment in june 1989

the united states already the worlds largest 
debtor country could see its foreign debt increase to more than 2 
trillion by 1995 seriously cutting into american living standards 
a congressional study said 
the report relesed saturday by the congressional research 
service rejected claims by the reagan administration that the 
countrys status as a large debtor country was not cause for 
concern 
the study predicted that while the countrys trade deficit will 
finally show an improvement this year after deteriorating for six 
years this improvement could be shortlived 
the report forecast that the deficit in the broadest measure of 
trade the current account would fall to 151 billion this year 
down slightly from a record 154 billion deficit in 1987 
the report predicted a further decrease to 129 billion in 1989 
saying these improvements were virtually assured given the declines 
in the value of the dollar that have already taken place 
but the study said the trade deficit would begin rising again 
sharply in the 1990s and could hit 326 billion by 1995 
the study said it based this outlook on assumptions that the 
dollar does not decline further in value and that current growth 
rates and interest rates in the united states relative to other 
countries remain essentially unchanged 
the dollar has actually been rising in recent weeks prompting 
concern among economists who believe the us currency still needs 
to drop for the us trade deficit to narrow further a cheaper 
dollar makes us exports more attractive on overseas markets and 
imports more expensive to americans 
if the dollar does not decline the report projected that the 
heavy import penetration the united states has suffered through the 
1980s will continue 
the string of higher trade imbalances would mean that the 
countrys position as a net debtor would worsen as well 
the government announced on thursday that total us foreign 
debt increased to 3682 billion at the end of 1987 further 
lengthening the countrys lead as the worlds largest debtor 
nation this means that foreigners now own more in us investments 
than americans own in overseas investments 
the congressional study projected that us foreign debt would 
climb to 576 billion at the end of this year and surpass 1 
trillion in 1991 by the end of 1995 the total foreign debt would 
be 206 trillion or onefourth of the countrys total gross 
national product the report said 
a debt of that size would require an annual payment of 96 
billion to foreigners to service the debt an amount equal to 12 
percent of the projected gnp for that year the study said 
that would mean if the gnp increased by 3 percent in 1995 a 
generally optimistic outlook onethird of the increase would be 
siphoned off to meet debt obligations to foreigners 
if on the other hand we are pessimistic about real growth 
prospects seeing only a 1 percent annual increase as likely then 
debt service would tend to preclude any improvement in us living 
standards in the next decade the report said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who requested the congressional 
study said it showed that without a dramatic change in the 
countrys trade policies the size of americas foreign debt will 
explode over the next six years 
bentsen was a key sponsor of an omnibus trade measure recently 
vetoed by president reagan he is leading the effort to get a 
strippeddown version less objectionable to reagan passed into law 
even though the trade deficit will go down a little this year 
and again a little bit next year unless trade policies 
dramatically change then theyre going to start up bentsen said 
the congressional study while presenting a pessimistic view of 
what could happen is not out of line with projections made by 
private economists morgan guaranty trust co said that depending 
on what happens to the dollar world growth rates and the us 
federal budget deficit americas foreign debt burden could be 
anywhere from 900 billion to 25 trillion by 1995 
the us debt of 3682 billion for 1987 was 368 percent higher 
than the previous year and served to illustrate how fast the 
foreign debt is accumulating the united states had an investment 
cushion of 894 billion as recently as 1983 making it the worlds 
largest creditor nation a position now held by japan 
democratic critics hope to make the countrys slide from the 
largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation an issue in 
this years presidential campaign they contend that the burgeoning 
foreign debt is eroding americas political and economic standing 
in the world 
but the administration sensitive to the issue in an election 
year held a lengthy briefing last thursday when the new debt 
total was released to argue that the united states should not be 
considered in a class with such large third world debtors as 
brazil mexico and argentina 
we are nowhere near getting into trouble commerce 
undersecretary robert ortner told reporters he said that 
foreigners still own no more than 5 percent of the assets in an 
economy that turns out 45 trillion in goods and services a year 
but private economists contend that the growing foreign debt 
makes the united states more vulnerable to pressure from foreign 
investors driving up us interest rates and heightening the 
volatility of the dollar

most federal efforts to halt discrimination 
against female business owners have been superficial 
unimaginative and lacking in longterm commitment a bipartisan 
house report said 
the report released saturday by the small business committee 
also concluded that the federal government has been seriously 
delinquent in helping female entrepreneurs gain access to 
government contracts and subcontracts 
furthermore the report said women face genderrelated barriers 
that severely limit their access to business credit it also said 
that statistics on female entrepreneurs are insufficient to help 
policy makers deal with these problems 
women owned 25 percent of us businesses in 1982 but received 
only 10 percent of business receipts according to the census 
bureau business size and type account for some but not all of the 
discrepancy the report said 
there are other less defensible reasons namely sex 
stereotyping and continued discrimination the report said 
women have had to work harder wait longer manage with fewer 
dollars and be content with smaller operations just to maintain 
their present levels of independence and business success 
the chairman of the small business committee john j lafalce 
dny plans to introduce an omnibus womens business ownership 
bill later this month along with rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
head of the congressional caucus on womens issues 
in a statement accompanying his committees report lafalce said 
that the bill will address the four principal barriers blocking 
equal economic status for female entrepreneurs lack of management 
training and technical assistance lack of access to capital the 
virtual exclusion of women from government contracts and lack of 
accurate and timely data on femaleowned businesses 
according to the report women owned less than 5 percent of 
american businesses 15 years ago compared with 28 percent today 
they are starting firms at twice the rate of men and are expected 
to own 50 percent of us businesses by the year 2000 
these women are part of the most educated generation of women 
that has ever existed they are a gold mine of human capital the 
report said it is essential that remaining barriers to women 
entrepreneurship be eliminated 
the committee recommended a number of steps to correct problems 
that came to light during a series of hearings on the issue among 
them 
establishment of a womens business council with both public 
and private representatives to develop an action plan that 
includes goals and timetables the plan would be due at the end of 
1989 
creating a guaranteed miniloan program within the small 
business administration for loans of up to 50000 firms in the 
fastgrowing service sector where femaleowned businesses are 
concentrated would be targeted 
requiring the federal reserve to limit inquiries into marital 
status for commercial loans and requiring lending institutions to 
notify clients of their right to learn why they were denied loans 
forming a publicprivate partnership fund to provide management 
training and technical assistance for female business owners 
reforming the federal procurement system to give women greater 
access to contracts and subcontracts including annual 
participation goals 
requiring large government contractors by statute to 
establish subcontracting goals for femaleowned businesses 
developing a highquality computer listing of firms controlled 
by women

11 a published report said 
security guards at the plants in amsterdam and mayfield ny 
near albany said workers were given friday off as a paid holiday 
the hartford courant reported saturday 
the guards said the plants also would be closed this week but 
employees would not be paid for that time off 
about 110 people work at the coleco plants 
the companys ability to make this weeks payroll was questioned 
after a new york court issued a restraining order wednesday 
freezing coleco bank accounts in albany at the request of coleco 
suppliers who had not been paid 
officials from the international leatherworkers union which 
represents colecos production workers at the new york plants 
could not be reached for comment friday 
the companys west hartford headquarters were closed for the 
long holiday weekend but a security guard said the offices would 
reopen tuesday 
company chairman morton e handel said friday his company has 
enough funds to carry it through another week he said a group of 
12 foreign and domestic lenders to which coleco owes 103 million 
agreed to provide money to the company through thursday 
handel recuperating at home from openheart surgery said no 
steps had been taking toward a bankruptcy filing if anything is to 
happen it would be this week he said 
on thursday the west hartford toy company gave up on its plan 
to restructure its debts after it had repeatedly extended a 
deadline for agreement by debtholders 
coleco had proposed exchanging 335 million of bonds for a 
combination of new bonds and stock the company said the exchange 
would save it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and 
supply cash for the business 
the original exchange terms were rejected by some of the 
bondholders who contended the exchange would have reduced the 
value of their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from 
colecos stockholders and bankers 
the company produces such wellknown toys as cabbage patch kids 
dolls and scrabble board games 
coleco has been trying since january to cut costs and 
restructure its finances it lost 474 million in the quarter that

illinois businessman edward f heil has 
purchased 62 percent of morrison knudsen corps shares but wall 
street analysts dismissed speculation he might try to take over the 
engineering shipbuilding and construction company 
in a statement filed with federal regulators heil of the 
chicago suburb downers grove said his purchase of 670300 morrison 
knudsen shares was intended as an investment but also said he 
wanted to win a seat on the companys board of directors 
heil is president of american environmental construction co 
neither he nor his attorney could be reached for comment 
morrison knudsen a major contractor for the pentagon released 
a statement friday saying the company was aware of heils filing 
and reviewing the situation closely with its advisers 
the company said it knew little about heil but noted he is a 
defendant in a lawsuit brought by the state of illinois morrison 
knudsen said the suit charged heil and his company with a variety 
of fraudulent activities in connection with a construction project 
on which heils company was a prime contractor 
according to ileen lasko of the illinois attorney generals 
office heil was among 14 contracting companies and their officers 
named in a civil suit brought by the state over a major chicago 
convention center project 
illinois attorney general neil f hartigan charged the 
contractors with submitting phony bills for labor and materials 
through dummy minority contractors 
morrison knudsen said the suit sought to prevent any company of 
which heil is a director from doing business with illinois since 
morrison knudsen has a contract on a public project in illinois and 
is bidding on another the company said it was investigating 
other potential violations of applicable law by heil 
meanwhile wall street analysts discounted a possible takeover 
attempt by heil 
he doesnt represent a real threat to morrison knudsen said 
robert mccoy an analyst at the investment firm kidder peabody amp 
co inc 
the company has disappointed certain people with their real 
estate writeoffs and shipbuilding writeoffs but theyre 
trying to make their business more competitive and there is no 
reason to believe they wont mccoy said 
in the statement filed with the securities and exchange 
commission heil revealed that he had acquired the outstanding 
morrison knudsen common stock from may 12 through thursday at 
prices ranging from just over 36 to nearly 41 a share there are 
about 109 million shares of common stock outstanding 
morrison knudsen stock closed at 42 in trading friday on the 
new york stock exchange up 75 cents a share 
morrison knudsen posted an operating loss for 1987 but has been 
undergoing a restructuring that included closing its real estate 
development subsidiary 
in the first quarter morrison knudsen reported it earned 659 
million up 9 percent from 603 million in the first three months 
of 1987 
as a defense against any unfriendly takeover attempts the 
company adopted a poison pill stock purchase right in 1986 
under the plan morrison knudsen shareholders can buy additional 
stock at a discount while such a plan might not prevent a 
takeover it would force hostile buyers to negotiate with the 
companys board before making such a move
