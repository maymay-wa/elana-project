a denver minister said monday that he would drop 
his churchs sponsorship of a boy scout troop unless the 
organization reverses itself and allows a homosexual man to serve on 
the troops parents committee 
i believe the boy scout law is a correct one to serve god and 
country said the rev edward ostertag rector of st barnabas 
episcopal church 
but i dont think god or my country trashes people if the boy 
scouts have departed from that they should let the sponsoring 
agencies know they have departed from that old law 
ostertag said the homosexual man who has a son in troop 13 was 
one of 16 people appointed to the parents committee which 
supervises the activities of the 35 scouts in the troop 
he said the boy scout organization revoked the mans registration 
after learning that he was an admitted homosexual ostertag would 
not name the father 
the boy scouts of america has upheld the decision at the district 
and regional levels the case now is before the national council of 
the boy scouts ostertag said 
barclay bollas a spokesman at the organizations national 
headquarters in irving texas said monday that the boy scouts of 
america has a policy barring membership to homosexuals and has 
invoked that policy before 
we do not believe homosexuals make appropriate leaders for a 
youth organization like the boy scouts bollas said 
both the troop committee and the parents of the scouts have voted 
to support ostertags campaign on behalf of the man 
ostertag said it is not easy finding volunteers who will take 
scouts on camping trips and oversee their work on merit badges 
especially in denvers capitol hill neighborhood where many 
residents are single 
this is holy week and i feel uncomfortable celebrating good 
friday and then having to turn around to this man and say youre 
trash and we dont want you around the minister said i dont 
go for that

president bush on monday defended his lifelong 
membership in the national rifle association while voicing support 
for a constitutionally sound further crackdown on semiautomatic 
weapons 
we are in different times now and i am convinced that 
reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the 
problem he told a group of women state legislators at the white 
house 
meanwhile white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called 
for a cooling down of emotions in the guncontrol dispute saying 
the president feels we dont need to be threatening each other 
he was referring to news reports that nra officials had 
indirectly threatened drug czar bill bennett with political 
retaliation if he pursues a course toward more firearms restrictions 
allegations that the gun owners lobby denied anew monday 
this is not a time to be threatening people but rather a time 
to try to work together to solve a problem that clearly needs to be 
solved fitzwater said 
while considering gun measures bush is also looking at moves to 
fight the drug problem in the nations capital including the 
possible use of federal troops the new york times reported 
bush is willing to consider bringing in the national guard under 
federal command or using regular military forces if the district 
of columbia police force is unable to curb washingtons mounting 
murder rate the newspaper reported in its tuesday editions 
the administration has not detailed how the guard might be used 
the newspaper said 
the administration last week announced it was banning the import 
of semiautomatic weapons bush had said the move reflected a pulse 
change on his part on the subject of gun control which in the 
past he has steadfastly opposed 
clearly theres been some evolution of his bushs thinking 
on gun control fitzwater said monday 
bush has directed bennett to review the entire subject of 
semiautomatic weapons fitzwater said that neither an expansion of 
the ban nor other new restrictions on guns would be proposed during 
the overall review that bennett is overseeing 
the president told his audience on the nra of which im a 
member a proud member i might add i believe that we can find 
accommodation between the legitimate interests of the sportsman and 
the interest of the police chiefs in protecting their people who put 
their lives on the line every single day 
the country needs to know that there is some answer to this i 
dont yet know what it is he said 
while much of the answer rests with the states we have a 
responsibility at the federal level as well bush said 
we have got to give the police proper support when they lay 
their lives on the line for us and so well find some answer that 
is constitutionally sound and that also protects the lives as best 
one can from washington of police officers 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press last week that bennett had been receiving warnings from the 
rifle association through third parties hinting that nras campaign 
fundraising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought 
political office 
bennett said through a spokesman don hamilton that there have 
been a lot of phone calls a lot of pressure lets cool off 
wayne lapierre legislative director for the nra insisted monday 
that we never made a threat in the first place its not the way 
we operate its not the way the nra functions i dont know how to 
be any clearer than that 
he said that the nra shares the nations heightened outrage 
about violent crime on the nations streets we want to be a 
part of the solution were going to be in there in a constructive 
way 
but he said in an interview we dont believe we should be 
pushed into a cosmetic solution that wont address the real issues 
and wont solve the real problems 
theres nothing new about semiautomatic firearms theyve been 
around for a century he said he claimed the problem was failure 
to use existing laws to prosecute drug dealers who use guns 
illegally its not that we dont know who these people are they 
glow in the dark 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile said he had not heard about 
alleged nra threats against bennett but if theyre saying that 
they shouldnt 
bill bennetts doing a good job the president is very serious 
about what he has had to say quayle said

the rightwing republican 
nationalist alliance claimed victory in sundays presidential 
election scarred by clashes between rebels and troops that left at 
least 29 dead three journalists also were killed 
the alliance known as arena said its candidate gained more than 
50 percent of the vote 
that would be enough to avoid a runoff election next month 
against the incumbent christian democrats 
we are sure and we proclaim oursevles the victors roberto 
daubuisson founder of arena told a news conference 
arena presidential candidate alfredo cristiani said the party had 
results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of 
victory 
election authorities said preliminary officials results were 
expected monday 
a boycott by leftist rebels and scattered gun battles between 
guerrillas and troops trimmed the voter turnout 
six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the 
rebels tried to disrupt the voting according to col emilio ponce 
chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
two salvadoran journalists and a dutch television cameraman also 
were killed one during clash at a rebelheld town and the others 
at military checkpoints 
christian democratic candidate fidel chavez mena had said he 
expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital but 
san salvadors channel 12 television station said cristiani was 
running strongly enough to win a clear majority 
the christian democrat headquarters was virtually deserted sunday 
night and the party provided no results 
we have the 50 percent that is needed to win and i can assure 
you there will be no second round said daubuisson i am proud 
to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as freddy 
cristiani to the presidency 
critics claim arena is still controlled by daubuisson a retired 
army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death 
squads daubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations 
polls closed at 5 pm 6 pm est there was no official word 
on turnout but a spot check by the associated press at several 
polling places in san salvador showed between 55 and 65 percent of 
those registered had cast ballots 
ana guadalupe martinez a rebel spokeswoman in mexico city said 
enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no 
election could be held without participation by the guerrillas 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
she said no polling places or voters had been attacked as the 
guerrillas had pledged but rebel assaults on government 
installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls 
the guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged 
telephone lines and electricity which cut or restricted power to 80 
percent of the country 
roman catholic churches were crowded with palm sunday worshipers 
and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in 
san salvador turnout was light in many smaller towns 
with these problems its better to stay home said jose 
carlos ortiz 23 he spoke in front of his home in the capital as 
guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks 
away 
sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the guazapa volcano 
a guerrilla stronghold north of san salvador as troops fought 
insurgents in the 9yearold war that has claimed an estimated 
70000 lives 
there were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones 
were cristiani chavez mena and guillermo ungo of the leftist 
democratic convergence 
christiani and chavez mena were the only contenders with a chance 
to win 
christian democrat president jose napoleon duartes fiveyear 
term ends june 1 duarte barred by law from running for 
reelection is washingtons staunchest ally in central america he 
is dying of liver cancer 
cristiani has vowed to follow freemarket policies and reduce 
state intervention in the eonomy his party promised to step up the 
war if the guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front do not agree to lay down their arms 
cristiani voted sunday morning in san salvador and told a group 
of his supporters i hope the united states realizes that 
salvadorans want democracy with this effort theyre making to 
vote we dont want any more bombs 
chavez mena is a lawyer and heads the christian democrats 
conservative wing he struggled against opposition charges of 
corruption in the government and inability of the christian 
democrats to deal with the economy and the civil war 
leaders of the democratic convergence maintain formal links with 
the guerrillas this is the first election since 1977 in which 
socialist candidates have competed 
about 183 million people out of a population of 5 million were 
eligible to vote polls opened at 7 am in 243 of the countrys 262 
municipalities and closed at 5 pm 
nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting stations 
because election officials deemed those rebelheld zones too 
dangerous 
in san sebastian 30 miles east of the capital turnout was light 
the people are frightened said william doherty of the 
american aflcio there is no question that the intimidation by 
the guerrillas is working 
doherty is one of 21 congressmen state politicians and private 
citizens named by the white house to be official election observers 
he said turnout sunday was far less than during three previous 
elections he attended this decade 
cornel lagrouw a cameraman for dutch national television was 
killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern 
town of san francisco javier said bill gentile a us photographer 
for newsweek 
lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers 
who were in the town the others dragged him away and fled in two 
cars but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press 
markings and white flags on the vehicles gentile said 
the military said it had no immediate information on the report 
two salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously 
wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles the armed 
forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks 
in the march 1988 elections for the national assembly arena won 
32 seats the christian democrats 23 and the national conciliation 
party six but a group called the authentic christian movement split 
from the christian democrats taking 16 seats from duartes faction 
the next legislative elections are set for march 1991

laura goldin wants to substitute five words 
in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would 
undo years of antigay discrimination and opponents say would 
undermine societys structure 
the change goldin wrote in a proposed code revision unanimously 
endorsed by the bar association of san franciscos directors would 
define marriage as a personal relation arising out of a civil 
contract between two people 
under the law now its between a man and a woman 
the change would have let larry brinkin take a threeday leave 
after the death of his lover of 11 years his employer wouldnt let 
him off though a coworker got time off for the death of a 
stepmother he had never met 
it would have made it easier for donna hitchens and her partner 
to adopt hitchens an attorney had to become the childs guardian 
leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they 
successfully challenged the law ultimately they legally adopted 
two children 
it also would force hospitals to allow a gay aids patients lover 
into intensive care many only let in relatives 
gay couples live in a limbolike state outside of the law 
said peter keane president of the local association its a 
pariahtype class thats set up within the law to me its an 
unfairness issue 
redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the 
rights privileges and burdens of marriage to gay couples among 
the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax 
exemptions inheritance laws pensions and health plans as well as 
parenting privileges and adoption rights 
were not for it said deacon norman d phillips spokesman 
for catholic archbishop john quinn to us marriage is a sacrament 
with deeply religious overtones our church believes marriage can 
only be entered into by a male and a female quinn believes some 
inequities may warrant compensation but calls for use of contracts 
that dont establish a quasimarriage 
the resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by 
the state bar conference of delegates in september when about 500 
representatives of the states 117000 lawyers will consider and 
propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts if it passes bar 
lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor 
the specification of a man and a woman became law in 1977 
after a spate of gay marriages which werent prohibited then under 
the amendment signed by gov jerry brown homosexuals have little 
say regarding partners medical care and cannot share insurance 
coverage or health benefits 
in west hollywood the first us city governed by a majority of 
gay city officials unmarried city employees may add their partners 
to health benefit and pension plans berkeley and santa cruz offer 
similar benefits 
in san francisco where an estimated 10 percent of residents are 
gay board of supervisors president harry britt the panels only 
gay member has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to 
alternative families 
goldin who is not gay is a member of the bar association she 
said her proposal also would include child custody community 
property and spousal support obligations 
supporters dont anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to 
the altar but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity 
and equal rights 
auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude 
homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples and income tax laws 
favor married couples in some ways according to karen strauss of 
the lesbian rights project 
so long as benefits are given or taken away based on 
relationship status then we want access to them as well said 
cynthia goldstein an attorney with national gay rights advocates 
like many lesbians hitchens says she would marry if she could 
after 12 years with her partner and two adopted children she said 
economics not emotion would prompt her to tie the legal knot 
brinkin who lost a court battle against his employer over 
bereavement leave for the death of richard reich isnt sure whether 
he would marry my commitment comes from my heart and i dont need 
a piece of paper to do that 
advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of 
law that the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the 
constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and 
should cover homosexuals 
my guess is that the debate is going to be much more 
sociological than legal said colin wied president of the state 
bar society would recoil at this idea my guess is that lawyers 
will follow suit

miguel braschi and leslie blanchard were 
regarded by friends as a loving couple their manhattan apartment 
the home of any happily married couple but braschi faces 
eviction because their landlord disagrees 
when blanchard died in braschis arms in 186 blanchards name 
was on the lease to the rentcontrolled apartment the two men had 
shared for a decade 
leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the 
rent control laws in new york citys tight and pricy real estate 
market braschi says that as a family member he should have 
succession rights even though his name wasnt on the lease 
the landlord stahl associates co maintains braschi had no 
right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of 
blanchards traditional family unit those related by blood 
marriage or adoption 
according to thomas stoddard executive director of the lambda 
legal defense fund a gay rights group the case is about 
individuals who live in families that vary from the ozzie and 
harriet mold 
state court judge harold baer ruled that the men were a family 
under the rentcontrol law because of the time love and 
commitment given by braschi to blanchard baer halted the 
eviction but was overturned on appeal the court of appeals new 
yorks highest court will hear arguments april 26 
braschi is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in 
court 
its not just a question for gay people stoddard said 
its an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a 
nontraditional nonorthodox relationship and be protected by the 
law 
the court of appeals must decide whether people in 
nontraditional living arrangements homosexuals unmarried 
heterosexuals even elderly couples have the same protection as 
married couples and blood relatives 
the court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple 
couldnt adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an 
apartment that only allowed family members to live together 
this is the most important case in the country dealing with 
nontraditional family arrangements said stoddard the courts 
decision could affect insurance hospital visiting rights 
inheritance and other areas in which the definition of family is 
crucial 
blanchard had hired braschi to manage his exclusive manhattan 
beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary leaving him 5 million 
braschi and blanchard exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of 
their commitment braschi 33 now wears both 
he cared for blanchard during the final months of his life and 
was holding blanchard in his arms when he died in september 1986 
braschi 33 says he and blanchard regarded one another as 
spouses 
their friends regarded them as a married couple and their 
apartment as the home of any happily married couple according 
to court papers 
stahl associates has argued that the legislature never extended 
succession rights to members of a nontraditional family unit 
and has accused braschi of trying to turn the case into a 
referendum on homosexual rights 
braschis lawyers say stahl is trying to create that impression 
to prejudice the atmosphere and that the case is simply about 
family rights 
what this case is about is peoples relationships whether they 
will be protected based on the strength of the relationship said 
nan hunter a lawyer for the american civil liberties union which 
represents braschi 
it speaks in terms of family relationships family would be 
not just spouses youre protected under this law if its your 
uncle

this towns oneman police force says 
officials have idled his squad car because he wont turn the town 
into a speed trap 
out of gas mayor and city council refuse to buy gas reads a 
plywood sign on top of the car parked at melvin villemarettes house 
theyre wishing that id quit but im too old in this game to 
quit that easy said villemarette police chief and only officer 
in this central louisiana village of about 800 
villemarette claims mayor nathan jeansonne and the board of 
aldermen want him out of office and have heated up a longrunning 
feud over speeding tickets since he won reelection in october to a 
third term he says he encouraged two parttime patrolmen to quit by 
giving them bad working hours after the board urged the officers to 
set traps 
theyd park on the edge of town near the speed zone signs a 
person from marksville comes cruising in and they would stop 
that person no questions asked to me thats a big ripoff 
or they would be hiding in the brush waiting for a nice little 
family to come down i dont go for all that malarkey the police 
chief said 
but jeansonne said the board decided to allocate 50 a month for 
gasoline instead of reimbursing the chief an average of 275 a month 
because the squad car is driven much less 
most times his car is parked at city hall or the baptist 
church alderman james gauthier complained 
while the dispute simmers villemarette said he will use his own 
car to answer police calls and gauthier said avoyelles parish 
sheriff bill belt has agreed to patrol the town

the selection of a shrewd 
affable pragmatist as president pw bothas successor is 
contributing to a surge of hope for a peaceful breakthrough in south 
africas political stalemate 
so far however the optimistic musings are coming almost 
exclusively from whites 
black leaders make clear they will be relieved when botha steps 
down but they suspect his heir apparent fw de klerk will 
preside over changes more cosmetic than substantive 
mangosuthu buthelezi the zulu political leader denounced by many 
black activists as too conservative says he will oppose de klerk 
until the government gives blacks full voting rights there is no 
sign de klerk contemplates such action 
at the other end of the black political spectrum the african 
national congress guerrilla movement says changes under de klerk 
will be in personal style not national party policy 
de klerk and botha are pieces of the same carcass spokesman 
tom sebina said from the outlawed movements exile headquarters in 
lusaka zambia if the meat is bad the meat is bad 
botha 73 resumed his presidential duties last week after an 
eightweek convalescence from a stroke in the interim he resigned 
as national party leader and was replaced by de klerk the minister 
of national education 
in a dramatic chain of events nationalist newspapers and 
politicians began suggesting that botha should retire botha 
responded by declaring he would stay in office until next year and 
the partys parliamentary caucus resolved that it wanted de klerk to 
be president 
however the party has neither the constitutional power nor the 
appetite to force botha from office de klerk said friday he will 
seek cordial coexistence with the president while urging his party 
to break new ground in pursuing political reform 
de klerk who turned 53 saturday has never been viewed as 
liberal but supporters and skeptics alike depict him as more 
openminded and less imperious than botha who has headed the 
government since 1978 
after becoming party leader de klerk called for a south africa 
free of domination and oppression other party officials say at 
least some remaining apartheid laws those segregating residential 
areas and public facilities may be modified 
helen suzman longserving legislator for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party said of de klerk people are being too 
optimistic if they think he is going to throw fundamental policy 
overboard 
but i think hes pragmatic and intelligent she said he 
realizes that change is absolutely inevitable that the sooner we 
get on with it the more chance there is that change and reform will 
be accomplished peacefully 
de klerk does not have the same close ties to the military and 
police that botha nurtured but he is committed firmly to 
segregating neighborhoods and schools for whites who want them and 
his proposal for genuine power sharing with blacks as yet has no 
substance 
his ascendency coincides with other developments that have 
induced the broadest optimism about south africa since black unrest 
broke out in 1984 british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
last week encouraging changes were unfolding in south africa 
these include major foreign policy initiatives such as 
independence for namibia and rapprochement with mozambique after 
prolonged hostility but antiapartheid leaders view seemingly 
notable domestic developments with skepticism for example a 
governmentappointed law commission attracted international 
publicity this month by calling for a bill of rights abolition of 
apartheid laws and full voting rights for blacks human rights 
activists doubted the proposals would be implemented and the 
government reacted with silence 
similarly black clergymen were unimpressed when delegates from 
the white dutch reformed church to which most national party 
officials belong issued a statement describing apartheid as a sin 
last week the full policymaking body of the afrikaner church balked 
at endorsing the delegates stance 
the government spurned recent suggestions by dutch reformed 
church leader johan heyns and beeld a major afrikaanslanguage 
newspaper that it drop its demand the anc renounce violence before 
negotiations are held there is no indication jailed anc leader 
nelson mandela will be freed soon 
one of the most informed assessments of de klerk came in a recent 
magazine article by his brother willem a former newspaper editor 
who quit the national party out of disenchantment with apartheid 
willem de klerk described his brother as fair friendly and 
humble but committed to the ideology of separating racial groups 
if fw can give the national party a new credibility among all 
population groups and in international politics he will herald a 
breakthrough toward a new future but if he continues along the old 
path he will merely be a transitional figure who will let us keep 
treading water he said

washington mayor marion barrys security force 
often erforms duties such as babysitting running personal errands 
and soliciting home telephone numbers from new female acquaintances 
the washington post reports 
the post in its monday editions said two citypaid security 
officials babysat the mayors son and a playmate while the mayor was 
in a hotel 20 minutes away during a trip to the virgin islands last 
year 
the paper quoted a model identified as grace t shell as saying 
that one of the mayors security officers approached her for her 
telephone number in 1987 
about two dozen security officers make up the 1 millionayear 
detail 
the paper said police officials have voiced concern that the 
mayor often requires the officers to station themselves a few blocks 
away or at the police garage where the security detail is based 
the security detail should not be leaving the mayor anywhere 
the paper quoted one highranking police official as saying 
mayoral spokesman john white said he had received no official 
notification of any practice of using security officers for 
babysitting or personal errands while barry is left unprotected 
white said it is important for the mayor to be adequately 
protected adding from time to time the mayor has had threats 
against his life and his family 
barry has been dogged by recent allegations that he has used 
drugs and by charges of drugselling lodged in the virgin islands 
against a former associate charles lewis whom barry had visited 
several times at a washington hotel in december the mayor has 
repeatedly denied using drugs or having any knowledge of any 
possible drug connection involving lewis

february 
the job apparently involving research for legislation shaw 
sponsored to end pricefixing in the book trade entitled the 
27yearold aide to a security pass that gave her access to much of 
the house of commons 
on sunday the news of the world alleged the woman identified 
variously as pamella bordes pamella bardes and pamela singh also 
works as a call girl charging at least 860 a night the newspaper 
attributed its information to an investigator who spoke with her 
in a hotel bedroom 
other newspapers rushed into print with an array of pictures of 
darkmaned miss bordes hobnobbing with the london glitterati 
they reprinted pictures of her as sports minister colin 
moynihans date at the conservative party winter ball there were 
photos of her out and about with andrew neil editor of the sunday 
times and at a party with donald trelford editor of the rival 
observer 
no one has suggested there is anything wrong with miss bordes 
seeing the high and mighty after hours but on friday the tabloid 
evening standard introduced a new element libya 
quoting a close unidentified friend of miss bordes the standard 
said she is believed to have close social links with one of 
revolutionary libyan leader colonel moammar gadhafis closest 
aides 
it said she made regular trips to paris to meet ahmed gadaff al 
daim whom the paper identified as a cousin of gadhafi and a major 
in the libyan security service 
the paper quoted a security source as confirming that al daims 
movements are monitored in the west and claimed miss bordes made 
several visits to tripoli by private jet 
the news will have grave security implications for the british 
government opined the standard and some lawmakers were quick to 
agree 
ted leadbitter of the opposition labor party an expert on 
espionage said the persistent reports linking pamella bordes 
with people in prominent positions and more recently actually 
touching upon areas of possible security risk suggest if true 
the urgency of the government undertaking the fullest possible 
pressing and penetrating inquiry 
the today newspaper has already dubbed miss bordes the new 
keeler referring to the former call girl whose simultaneous 
affairs with war minister john profumo and a soviet diplomat rocked 
a british government 26 years ago 
on thursday the sun britains largest circulation newspaper 
quoted an acquaintance david sullivan as saying miss bardes told 
him my secrets could bring down the government just like 
christine keeler did 
what these secrets might be nobody knows miss bordes has 
not publicly commented on her newfound notoriety and has not 
surfaced in public 
but if she was correctly quoted said labors dale 
campbellsavors then im sure many members of parliament will 
wonder to put it bluntly what the hell is going on 
her security pass was yanked as soon as her name hit the 
headlines and house of commons security rules are to be tightened 
next month

christianinwonderland did it again 
after the patchwork blaze of color in his winter readytowear 
collection last week christian lacroix topped his own act sunday 
with a second show the more expensive and sublime luxe 
collection 
often capping the outfits with his favorite mad hatter hat 
he showed rich clothes in the line he nicknamed jogging to 
byzantium 
lacroix led off with a bronze taffeta belted trench coat with a 
grand fox collar followed up by a tangerine long wraparound skirt 
topped with a beavercollared raspberry jacket 
soft imitation leopard added more deluxe touches to jacket 
linings big stoles and an occasional turban cap 
little short fitted suits with flared bell skirts came out in 
stainedglass shades of persian killim rug patterns 
his favorite trapezeshaped topper looked great with deep mink 
cuffs on hot orangered bouclette wool over a mildly flared skirt 
a fabulous eggshaped carnation pink iridescent taffeta coat 
over a salmon satin suit was breathtaking 
for evening wear rich women might choose the strapless dresses 
in fortuny panne velvets with strapless bosoms draped in lame 
the gold of byzantium was shot through the collection even for 
evening blazers with paisley patterns in the brocade and goldfinger 
himself couldnt have faulted the shimmering lame trouser outfit 
with flared pants 
never one to shy away from color and opulence lacroix laid on 
both in plenty especially for evening but he did it with such a 
light touch that the audience was dazzled 
the grand finale was a group of oriental odalisque outfits 
with harem pants in turquoise red and gold iridescent panne velvets 
meanwhile this versatile designer is already well into his next 
project designing 350 costumes for a spectacular production of 
carmen to take place in early july in the ancient arena at 
nimes near lacroixs native arles in provence 
this time hes putting all his inventiveness into costumes for 
the american stars of the opera grace bumbry and neil shicoff 
singing carmen and don jose 
i grew up with carmen a very sexy lady and the first woman in 
my life lacroix said in an interview her outfits will be in 
gold and white coral shades and earth colors depending on the 
act 
one sure thing with lacroix dressing her miss bumbry wont look 
like the downandout cigarette girl she will play 
japanese designer hanae mori showed a gently demure collection 
under the rotunda of the old commodities market 
the most french of oriental designers and the only one to 
show haute couture as well went in strongly for feminine shapes and 
soft fabrics 
her navy pinstriped coatdresses suits with skirts and pants 
couldnt have been more classic 
diagonallystriped black and turquoise knit outfits were lively 
but never out of line lengths just around knee level 
like designers all over town miss mori is seeing spots for next 
winter and imitation leopard surged up here in flyaway trapeze 
shortie coats over narrow black skirts and animalspotted stockings 
for a touch of hot jazz she showed puffy tibetan lamb coats dyed 
in amethyst royal blue and shocking pink 
iridescent taffeta dresses with clocheshaped skirts over mounds 
of crinolines harked back to teadances for debutantes in the 1950s 
more interesting were the evening outfits in hanae moris forte 
flowerprinted silks this time they were beautiful and bold in 
turquoise peacock flame with gold borrowed from the best of 
japanese kimono fabrics 
on easter sunday miss mori will celebrate the opening of her new 
shop in monte carlo by presenting the collection at a charity gala 
for les oeuvres de soeur marie which benefits underprivileged 
and elderly people princess caroline will host the event for about 
700 guests 
maryll lanvins collection was eclectic bright and attractive 
aimed at women who frequent the best shops clubs and restaurants 
as usual the clothes were young and wellcut mainstream rather 
than trendsetting 
navy and big bands of violet piping were combined happily in a 
daytime group that had short flannel skirts pants shetland blazers 
and boleros 
worth noting were her big bold diagonal plaids in shades of 
yellow red emerald purple fuzzy plaid mohair coats and flyaway 
short trapeze coats looked outstanding over suits with long shetland 
jackets and lean dark skirts 
another new plaid was multicolored windowpane style on a dark 
boucle fabric it was striking in suits with both pants and short or 
longer skirts the easy alternatives here 
the shimmering dresses with hipbloused tops and leg omutton 
sleeves or shifts were looked pleasingly different in their outsized 
paisley patterns 
sleekly fitted moire dresses in gem colors with short skirts 
flaring at the hem are made to order for little dinners or big 
cocktail parties 
and lanvins lateday wear was best in fitted quilted silk 
jackets with splatter motifs on very bright colors over dark silk 
jersey skirts or flowing pajamas

the 5000 new words in the second 
edition of the oxford english dictionary say more about the glacial 
pace of lexicography than about the age of the words 
there are freshly minted terms such as aidsrelated antiquark 
fax filofax and ghettoblaster words or word senses redolent of 
the 1960s such as acid downer grok and chopper and jazzage 
coinages such as big apple 
theres even one new word from anglosaxon ash the symbol 
that combines the letters a and e 
the second edition to be published march 29 reflects more than 
a century of scholarly labor 
it pulls together the 400000 entries in the first edition 
completed between 1879 and 1928 the first supplement of 1933 the 
fourvolume second supplement of 19721986 and the 5000 new 
entries 
that chronology explains why the oed took so long to catch up 
with big apple new york citys nickname 
the first use of the term recorded by the dictionary is in 1927 
though weve since heard there was record of it in 1906 said 
john simpson the coeditor responsible for new words in the second 
edition 
now in the first edition of oed the letter b came out in 1885 
1886 so big apple wasnt available for inclusion then 
i think it was a pity it wasnt included in the supplement 
perhaps it wasnt really widely well known i dont know 
simpson also doesnt know why his entry for pythonesque 
inspired by the satirical lunacies of comedy troupe called monty 
pythons flying circus was ultimately rejected by robert 
burchfield editor of the second supplement 
so i thought ive had enough of that so i put it back in 
again for the second edition simpson said nobody objected so 
its gone in 
also inducted acid rain acupressure barf bleeper creation 
science detox diners club dingbat dutyfree endangered est 
fast track foxy great leap forward greenmail laptop nose job 
passive smoking plastic money and visa 
from now on the 20volume dictionary will be subject to rapid 
updating because this edition was prepared on a computer oxford 
university press hopes to offer it on computer discs by 1991 
the computer version will solve the ageold problem of looking up 
a word you cant remember the computer can look for definitions 
and much more 
the basic work of lexicography however is still done on index 
cards now numbering in excess of 3 million each containing a 
quotation found by a paid or volunteer reader to illustrate the use 
of a word 
the method is the same used by james ah murray the first 
editor of the oed who took on what was supposed to be a 10year 
task in 1879 and had completed the letter t at his death in 1915 
murray who appears in photos looking like an old testament 
figure in mortarboard and long white beard instructed his 
researchers to make a quotation for every word that strikes you as 
rare obsolete oldfashioned new peculiar or used in a peculiar 
way they were also asked to produce as many quotations as 
possible for ordinary words 
the oed surveys english from the middle of the 12th century and 
the research net covered the united states australasia india and 
the englishspeaking parts of africa and the caribbean 
we regard the oed as an international dictionary now said 
coeditor edmund weiner 
thats reflected in its production the dictionary was edited in 
oxford the computer program was developed by the university of 
waterloo in ontario the text was keyboarded in fort washington 
pa and the 10000 sets each weighing 1377 pounds were printed 
in taunton mass 
its hard to explain exactly when a word becomes so widely used 
that it qualifies for the oed weiner said but in practice words 
are almost always added by consensus based on citations from 
printed sources 
it is not our job to lay down what standard english is said 
weiner but to produce a photograph of english as it is used 
the dictionary records the language warts and all simpson 
said i would say we dont prescribe ourselves but we try to make 
it obvious in the entries if you are dealing with a particular use 
that a group of people dislike 
if a word is misused enough it may rate an entry thus 
contractural a common misspelling of contractual earned a citation 
in the oed simpson said 
some day it may be the standard spelling 
over history over and over again you see what was originally a 
nonstandard variation becoming standard and the standard one 
becoming oldfashioned and falling out of use weiner said 
these days disinterested is condemned when being used in the 
sense of not interested but actually its older in that sense 
we can only report that people grammarians or whatever said 
that a usage was wrong weiner said but very often you will 
find in the quotations that shakespeare or dryden or whoever 
actually did use this supposedly wrong usage and that rather 
confounds the extreme prescriptivist point of view

us customs officials are trying to block a 
shipment of a rocket fuel component allegedly headed for iran but a 
lack of cooperation between federal agencies could help free the 
chemical soon it was reported 
a shipment large enough to fuel 300 military missiles was seized 
in europe in february 1988 when customs service agents said it was 
being loaded onto an iranian freighter according to sundays los 
angeles times 
but the state department issued a special export license to the 
chemicals owner blocking customs court fight to forbid the 
shipment the newspaper said 
a federal judge in houston issued a temporary injunction 
requiring the government to release the 1144 drums of ammonium 
perchlorate last week another hearing is scheduled for today 
us district court judge sim lake ruled the rocket fuel 
ingredient was not among munitions restricted for shipment to iran 
by the state department and that customs failed to prove the 
shipment was bound for iran 
the 286000 pounds of the rocket fuel component shipped from 
houston in january 1988 by grindius corp of tampa fla was seized 
the following month as it was being loaded onto an iranian freighter 
in the dutch port of rotterdam 
the shipment was being sent during the iraniraq war when those 
countries were using surfacetosurface missiles 
grindius contends it never intended to sell the chemical to iran 
the shipping bill of lading shows it was bound for a buyer in basel 
switzerland 
following the seizure the state department issued a special 
export license covering the shipment 
the customs service has urged the state department to revoke the 
license the department has declined to do so and wouldnt comment 
on the case pending its court outcome 
customs officials also said the justice department is not sure 
whether it will pursue the agencys case because of lakes initial 
ruling 
lake blamed a lack of cooperation and communication between the 
various governmental agencies for the apparent conflict 
the united states exports between 1 million and 2 million pounds 
of ammonium perchlorate every year mostly to friendly nations 
the compound has been in short supply since may when an explosion 
in henderson nev destroyed a plant operated by pacific 
engineering and production co the primary manufacturer of ammonium 
perchlorate

thats my problem im a survivor said the 
old woman 
as she said it she raised her blue eyes so they made contact 
with the social worker sitting across the table and coincidentally 
with the camera 
there was a smile on her face as she talked about how strong she 
was how strong she had been all her life how she had always taken 
care of herself and of her husband before he died 
but now she was alone and sick and poor and beyond finding much 
to look forward to on earth 
the more she talked the sadder she became until she concluded 
that 68 is long enough to live and then she wept 
it is but one of several such scenes from a television 
documentary on the other side of easy street airing this 
week on public broadcasting system stations across the nation 
without exception the old people put on faces of strength even 
humor for the camera but they are not actors and also without 
exception their eyes reflect despair and in some cases a 
bewildered sense that they thought it wasnt supposed to turn out 
this way 
indeed that is the central point to the film that despite the 
social security program that has helped keep an increasing 
proportion of elderly americans from the poverty that afflicted 
their own elders those who remain poor well over 3 million do 
so with little hope 
the film shatters the stereotype that elderly persons are well 
off and none are poor said horace deets executive director of 
the american association of retired persons so many people 
struggle every day to retain some dignity in the face of extreme 
poverty 
ronald f pollack executive director of the villers foundation 
which financed the film along with aarp said after a preview 
screening that the problems portrayed in the film are not 
insoluble 
frankly its a question of political will said pollack who 
made the point that unlike younger and healthier people the 
elderly have little prospect of working their way out of poverty 
while not a pleasant viewing experience the film drives home the 
point that even the best laid plans dont always turn out 
and it shows that cutting through government red tape to get 
available benefits is not the easiest thing to do especially for a 
new widow reeling from the death of her husband from a long illness 
that wiped out what they thought would be a financial cushion 
aarp issued a study in conjunction with release of the film that 
showed fewer than half the elderly people eligible for the 
supplemental security income program which is supposed to provide a 
safety net for the poorest of the poor actually get their benefits 
the reasons vary widely from state to state and individual to 
individual but in most cases result from failure of the 
bureaucracy make the program easily available for those too 
unsophisticated or too proud to seek it out 
for those who do the maximum benefit is 368 per month for an 
individual and 553 per month for a couple

in the aftermath of the brutal senate battle 
over former sen john towers attempt to run the pentagon the tenor 
of a confirmation hearing seems to be getting as one senator says 
a little bizarre 
as evidence here are a few questions put by sen gordon 
humphrey rnh to lawrence eagleburger during his confirmation 
hearing last week to be deputy secretary of state 
humphrey well lets get to the important questions mr 
eagleburger first of all have you ever drunk anything stronger 
than warm milk 
eagleburger yes sir laughter 
humphrey strike one i notice you smoke too strike two 
have you ever in public or private pinched a womans behind 
eagleburger can i divide that into two questions laughter 
no sir 
the nominee a man to whom laughter came as easily as diplomatic 
analysis during the drawnout hearings apparently took no offense 
at humphreys questions and went on to discuss with him the tragedy 
of hunger that is gripping the african nation sudan 
the 30year veteran of government service whod accumulated a 
massive store of goodwill among senators was swiftly confirmed a 
day later by the full senate 
but all kidding aside eagleburgers two days of confirmation 
hearings served to point out that much confusion remains about what 
is required of a nominee for high public office whether in personal 
standards of conduct or in attempting to deal with questions of 
real or apparent conflict of interest 
it was clear that the shadow of towers ruined quest for 
confirmation which foundered on allegations of alcohol abuse 
womanizing and the nominees 1 million in fees as a consultant 
for defense contractors haunted eagleburgers nomination and may 
well haunt others in the future 
some of the most tense questioning during the senate foreign 
relations committee hearings came from sen jesse helms rnc he 
prodded eagleburger about the more than 900000 in income bonuses 
and severance the nominee received during his last of four years 
with the international consulting firm headed by former secretary of 
state henry kissinger 
you know the big deal that was made about john tower helms 
told eagleburger he was a piker compared to your income 
helms an archconservative who had been a vocal critic of 
kissingers policy of pursuing detente said he was worried about 
possible influence by the firms foreign clients 
there are a lot of people who wonder whether the advice you 
might give to the president or the secretary of state might be 
colored by the ongoing interest of firms foreign firms who have 
been paying you substantial fees helms told eagleburger 
eagleburger said he had provided analyses of political economic 
and societal developments for his clients many of them 
multinational corporations but that he never lobbied the us 
government on their behalf or engaged in any political activity for 
them 
to return to government and avoid even the appearance of a 
conflict of interest eagleburger said he cut all ties with 
kissinger associates sold all his investment stocks and 
volunteered to disqualify himself for a year from any dealings with 
the 15 clients hed worked for while at kissingers firm and been 
paid more than 5000 
this his attorney william rogers argued went far beyond 
what has customarily been required from government appointees such 
as cutting all ties with their former business associates and then 
being recused on a casebycase basis on the advice of government 
ethics attorneys 
but eagleburgers actions did not satisfy helms who said he 
wanted the names of all of the kissinger clients made public 
whether eagleburger had worked for them or not 
helms argued that since eagleburger had been paid out of a 
company pot of funds and not just by the clients he served it was 
necessary for the senate panel to have such information 
eagleburger said that was difficult for him since the list was 
considered confidential by the company 
helms request proved too much for sen joseph biden ddel who 
argued that its bizarre to require a nominee to disqualify 
himself from all dealings with any client that paid part of his 
income even though hed had no business dealings with them 
he said such a requirement would have disqualified former 
secretary of state cyrus vance former deputy secretary of state 
john whitehead treasury secretary nicholas brady omb director 
richard darman secretary of state george shultz and agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter many of whom had extensive business 
contacts with huge investment or law firms 
i think were getting a little daffy well be assured that 
the only person wholl well ever have as a secretary of state will 
be someone who has a career that is distinguished by doing 
nothing biden argued 
eagleburger sought to defuse the problem by offering to 
disqualify himself from any possible future dealings with any client 
of the kissinger firm from the past two years even those he didnt 
work with 
as well an informal arrangement was worked out biden said 
that did not require the nominee to meet a higher standard than what 
is required under the law 
eagleburger agreed to disclose the names of the clients to the 
state department legal adviser who is obligated to keep them 
private under an attorneyclient relationship and provide the list 
to the committee chairman sen claiborne pell dri and helms 
who agreed to treat it as a classified document

as congress goes into its third century the 
history of the first two is coming in for some increased attention 
it has been a neglected subject with much more scrutiny focused 
on the white house at the other end of the central stretch of 
pennsylvania avenue 
now however there is a 724page book on the history of the 
senate made up of speeches by former majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva 
and tonight most public television stations are carrying a 
90minute special called the congress using paintings 
photographs newsreels sound recordings and narration to depict the 
200 years since the first congress met in new york on march 4 1789 
historian william e leuchtenburg of the university of north 
carolina speaking at a recent gathering at the capitol to launch 
byrds book lamented that members of his profession have paid 
relatively scant attention to congressional history 
others whose business it is to get a balanced view of washington 
agree with him 
few good books have been written about congress despite the 
richness of the subject matter don phillips who covers the house 
for the washington post wrote recently 
in tonights television program writer david mccullough the 
narrator and coauthor stands before a backdrop of the capitol and 
says we are so accustomed to seeing our history measured by the 
presidency that we forget the extent to which the real story of our 
country takes place right there 
and it is in fact the building that is in many ways the star of 
the film whose producer ken burns won academy award nominations 
and other honors with previous documentaries about the brooklyn 
bridge and statue of liberty 
roaming around the capitol the camera fixes lovingly on the 
glowing rotunda presents speededup images of tourists passing the 
buildings monumental statues focuses on the hands of henry clay in 
a 19thcentury portrait 
it picks out the bust of richard nixon tucked away in an alcove 
off the senate floor along with those of others who presided over 
the senate as vice president 
there is also the voice of douglas macarthur interrupted by 
applause as he tells a joint session of congress old soldiers 
never die they just fade away 
there is even a shot of jimmy stewart awed by his first sight of 
the capitol dome as he arrives in washington to take up his senate 
duties in the movie classic mr smith goes to washington 
the film deals with the silliness and the backroom deals on 
capitol hill as well as such high drama as the civil rights debates 
of the late 1950s and early 1960s on the whole it is as burns told 
a preview audience at the national press club a very uncynical 
though not entirely uncritical view of the congress 
if all of this sounds to you like a valentine to an institution 
that is so often a whipping boy surely we can count on the 
washington reporters those hardbitten men and women who cover the 
congress to provide a more realistic and perhaps cynical view 
well burns and his colleagues interviewed some of them so 
listen 
charles mcdowell richmond timesdispatch and media general news 
service speaking of the capitol dome its a hat its a very 
majestic nice hat but a little bit ludicrous on something that we 
all care very much about the people are being represented under 
that thing and i can live with that corny thought 
cokie roberts national public radio and abc news it would be 
a true disaster if the modern demands of security keep american 
children from the ability to just sort of roam the capitol 
building 
david broder the washington post its also a kind of a 
wonderful place if you just let yourself have the freedom to do it 
to stand still for a moment and look at the people who are coming 
there to see their congress at work its marvelous to see their 
expressions as the dignity and the beauty of that building reach 
them for the first time 
ms roberts again on how the lawmakers go about their work i 
think quite frankly by the time the whole messy business is over 
with congress after congress that theyve done a pretty good job 
of it 
so much for cynicism 
the film was underwritten by the information industry giant 
ameritech and coproduced by weta of washington and florentine films 
byrds book the senate 17891989 is available from the 
government printing office in washington and its depositories around 
the country for 55

citing a report that found the superfund 
program ripe for a contracting scandal a house panel chairman says 
the environmental protection agency must avoid the morass of 
abuses that have plagued pentagon purchasing 
the general accounting office concluded in a new report that the 
epa is letting the growing number of contractors in the superfund 
program police themselves on potential conflicts of interest 
procedures are so lax that the agency might not discover a 
company it hired to investigate a hazardous waste dump also was 
working for the polluter of the site the gao said in a report 
obtained over the weekend by the associated press 
rep john d dingell dmich who requested the study wrote epa 
administrator william k reilly on friday the superfund contract 
program must avoid at all costs the morass of abuses and conflict of 
interest problems that plague the defense procurement system 
while it is important for contractors to have effective 
internal procedures in place it is also important that epa 
personnel have the independent capability to police the superfund 
contract system 
dingell is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
and the panels investigations subcommittee which has been 
investigating the superfund program 
the report concluded this system is currently dependent on 
contractors identifying and informing appropriate epa officials 
about conflicts 
it warned that a company working for both sides could feed the 
epa biased data thereby weakening legal efforts to recover cleanup 
costs from a polluter 
the report said the epa relies heavily on contractors to avoid 
conflicts but does not review contractors performance to ensure 
compliance with epas conflict of interest requirements 
the investigators said few conflicts have been found so far but 
cautioned this risk is a growing possibility in light of epas 
continuing efforts to expand the number of contractors used to 
perform remedial and technical enforcement activities 
in the 1988 fiscal year more than 600 million in contracts were 
approved by the agency for superfund projects compared to 973 
million in fiscal 1982 
superfund an 85 billion program to clean up hazardous waste 
sites relies increasingly on private companies for the preliminary 
investigations of polluted sites because the government has neither 
the manpower nor the expertise to do the work 
david oconnor director of epas procurement and contracts 
management division said were not in a position to police every 
situation with every firm out there the amount of effort required 
to do that would just be overwhelming 
he said a company caught working for both the agency and 
polluters at the same site could face a ban on epa work or 
termination of the contract 
we could take the position of being purists he said by 
prohibiting even the appearance of a conflict but he asked 
how strict can we get in appearance situations and still have 
companies that will work for us there is a limited industry we 
dont want to set up private sector contractors vs public sector 
contractors 
the gao investigators looked at seven contracts valued at 745 
million and involving work at sites all across the country 
five of the contracts were for studies that led to 
recommendations on how to clean up the sites two contracts were for 
investigating the parties responsible for pollution so legal cases 
could be developed for recovery of cleanup costs

ms rice said she frequently is recognized in public and has 
tried to hide her appearance by pulling her hair back 
in addition she added i have a disguise i have buck teeth

bent over and inserted the false teeth she stood upright looking 
like quite a different person

the action in congress this week is in the 
house which has a minimum wage debate on its agenda as well as 
items that could reshape the leadership of both parties in the 
chamber 
little legislation has moved through the congress so far this 
year with most of the time spent on the failed plan to raise 
congressional pay and the senate battle over the nomination of john 
tower for defense secretary 
president bush lost that one but his nomination of rep dick 
cheney to the pentagon post sailed to confirmation last week before 
the senate shut down for a twoweek recess 
in the house another fight between majority democrats and the 
white house looms 
bush has been adamant in saying he will agree to raise the 
minimum wage to no more than 425 an hour by 1992 and only if an 
accompanying training wage provision is approved allowing 
employers to pay new workers 335 the present minimum for up to 
six months 
democrats mindful of former president reagans success in 
blocking any increase are moving toward accepting some form of 
training wage but are refusing to scale back their bill which would 
boost the minimum to 465 in three years 
debate in the house is scheduled to begin wednesday or thursday 
when republicans will try again to substitute bushs proposal for 
the democrats bill and democrats tack on their own version of a 
training wage one unlikely to meet white house standards 
i think they want to play hardball with this bill and test the 
presidents mettle said rep dick armey rtexas a member of the 
house education and labor committee 
jay butler an aide to rep augustus hawkins dcalif the 
sponsor of the bill and chairman of the labor panel said hawkins 
was reviewing a handful of democratic proposals for a training wage 
and despite his longstanding opposition to such provisions will 
choose one to add to his bill that is a tacit admission democrats 
do not believe they could override a threatened veto 
the provision would require certification of training and have a 
life span considerably shorter than the six months espoused by bush 
butler said bushs proposal requires no skills training 
republicans argue that would discourage hiring in lowskills 
entrylevel jobs 
democrats argue that those paid the minimum wage frozen at 
335 for eight years have seen their buying power erode by nearly 
40 percent and that even an increase to 465 will lag behind 
inflation 
republicans counter by saying that raising the minimum wage will 
result in dramatic job losses cost the federal government millions 
if not billions and fail to help the working poor 
democrats have played down the employment implications of their 
bill which the bush administration says would cost 650000 jobs a 
congressional budget office analysis released friday put the number 
at 125000 to 250000 
backers of hawkins bill also have dismissed talk about the 
potential budget cost but republicans last week asserted that 
hawkins bill would result in the loss of more than 430000 jobs in 
four popular government programs alone unless another 570 million 
is spent on them 
the programs are college work study head start community 
service employers for older americans and the federal summer jobs 
program for youths 
the democrats are trying to represent the minimum wage as 
having no cost to the government armey said my point is if you 
believe in these programs do you want to cut thousands of people 
from them 
armey failed in an attempt to amend the legislation to exempt 
those programs from having to pay any increase in the minimum wage 
another bill due for floor debate this week would expand the 
rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud 
the measure sailed through the senate and bush supports it 
similar legislation was the subject of a controversial reagan veto 
the week also should bring changes to the house republican 
leadership and include debate that ultimately could reshape the 
democratic leadership as well 
gop lawmakers are expected to choose wednesday between two 
candidates vying to replace cheney in the no 2 leadership post 
pragmatist edward madigan of illinois and flamboyant conservative 
newt gingrich of georgia 
the balloting in that race will come as the chambers ethics 
committee deliberates whether speaker jim wright violated house 
rules through his financial dealings which have been the subject of 
a ninemonth panel investigation 
budget negotiations also are expected to continue this week and 
the house banking subcommittee will hold a final hearing on the 
savings and loan crisis before writing a 100 billion bailout plan 
likely to be drawn heavily from bushs recent proposal

now that nasa has completed its third 
straight successful postchallenger shuttle flight atlantis will be 
rolled to the launch pad wednesday for a mission that will include a 
planetary probe 
packed in atlantis cargo bay for the scheduled april 28 liftoff 
will be the magellan venus spacecraft the first planetary probe to 
be carried by a space shuttle and americas first planned planet 
flight since 1978 
magellan is to be released from the cargo bay after 466 days it 
is to orbit venus and map its cloudshrouded surface with high 
resolution radar 
discoverys return to earth on saturday following a successful 
fiveday mission buoyed the national aeronautics and space 
administrations ambitious plan to launch seven shuttles this year 
as it continues its recovery from the 1986 challenger explosion and 
builds toward a launch rate of 12 a year by 1992 
our goal is to fly again and again with safety always a 
prime consideration said richard truly shuttle program director 
he said discovery returned in better condition than any other 
shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch 
schedule 
truly said one stumbling block may be the extensive modifications 
being made to columbia the oldest shuttle that shuttles july 1 
target launch date with a classified military payload already has 
slipped about two weeks 
any additional holdup could push back another military shuttle 
flight planned in august and that could begin affecting the high 
priority october launch of atlantis with the galileo probe to 
jupiter 
we want very much to launch columbia in july truly said 
if not well delay it to meet the galileo window 
this is the third successful flight of the space shuttle since 
we have returned to flight truly said after discovery landed 
saturday it shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this 
is 
it also demonstrates he said that nasa has the capability of 
flying a busy and safe launch rate 
magellan and galileo are highpriority missions because there is 
only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are 
in the proper alignment for a launch 
heres the launch schedule for the remainder of the year 
april 28 atlantis with the magellanvenus spacecraft 
midjuly columbia with a defense department payload 
midaugust discovery with a defense department payload

dont look for the superheated exports of the 
1970s to return soon but an agriculture department economist says 
rising global demand for us agricultural products could bring at 
least a miniboom in the 1990s 
ron trostle of the departments economic research service says 
the growing demand isnt expected to match the fast pace of the 
1970s when the volume of farm exports rose an average of 9 percent a 
year the worlds economic growth rate in the 1990s simply is not 
expected to support that kind of growth 
but incomes in other countries are likely to rise faster in the 
next decade than they have in the 1980s trostle said and higher 
incomes should translate into greater demand for agricultural 
products 
the best markets for the united states will be the developing 
countries trostle said in an article prepared for the april issue 
of farmline magazine 
more of the worlds population will seek higher quality 
diets he said we will see a continuing gradual change toward 
higher valued and processed products such as meats fruits and 
vegetables and dairy products 
people with rising incomes will want more protein and that will 
generate a growing demand for livestock feed such as us corn so 
the countries can produce more meat trostle said foreign use of 
feed grains is expected to climb faster than food grains which 
include wheat and rice 
trostle and his agency colleagues say they cant make a flat 
prediction about the 90s being the start of a golden era because 
the future demand for american farm products could be either 
stifled or stimulated by any number of factors 
last years cropdepleting drought in the united states could 
trigger larger production by some export competitors wanting to cash 
in on the higher commodity prices 
developing countries could let domestic food prices rise thus 
encouraging farmers to produce more food for their own people in 
general that would tend to boost import demand by raising incomes 
and when incomes rise demand usually outruns a countrys ability to 
produce 
the soviet unions import needs particularly for soybean meal 
and other highprotein feeds are unknown at this time 
the outcome of current negotiations under gatt the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade and the future of trade barriers and 
export subsidies 
trostle said the years 198188 when us shipments abroad 
tumbled showed that exports are critical to american agriculture 
and when they suffer so do farmers 
the production from about one of every three acres harvested in 
the united states is marketed to consumers in other countries 
trostle said in recent years the value of total us 
agricultural exports averaged more than 16000 a farm 
trostle said foreign demand for agricultural products will 
probably grow more slowly in the 1990s than it did in the 1970s 
but faster than it did in the first half of the 1980s he cited 
several forces that help shape this outlook 
world population growth has slowed from a peak of 2 percent 
annually in the 1960s to about 17 percent now and the trend is 
expected to continue even so the slower growth will add about 80 
million more mouths to feed each year 
many countries will have slower income growth than in the 1970s 
but the increases in the 80s are projected to be faster than in the 
early 1980s particularly in the developing countries 
surpluses will continue to be more common than shortages in 
world markets so most commodities will be priced competitively 
often with favorable credit terms 
debt problems will continue to hold back both income and import 
demand in debtor countries but to a lesser degree over time as debt 
is gradually retired restructured forgiven or otherwise resolved

congress is trying to move the issues of 
affordable housing and homelessness to the forefront of the national 
agenda after eight years of cutbacks under the reagan 
administration 
more than a quarter of the senate last week cosponsored a bill 
that seeks to address the housing concerns of everyone from 
firsttime home buyers to the homeless 
the bill called the national affordable housing act seeks to 
set the framework for a new national housing strategy said sen 
alan cranston dcalif chairman of the banking housing and urban 
affairs subcommittee on housing 
it is imperative that we reverse a decade of neglect in 
housing i sense a growing impatience to raise housing back to 
the place it deserves in the nations priorities said cranston 
the bills primary sponsor 
the act would require states and local governments to submit 
fiveyear housing plans to the department of housing and urban 
development and update the plans annually it also would create a 
single institution within hud with the authority to provide direct 
assistance to government agencies 
it would establish an assistant housing secretary post to 
administer programs for the elderly handicapped and homeless 
for individuals the bill would seek to reduce the size of down 
payments and allow firsttime home buyers to use funds from 
individual retirement accounts or 401k retirement plans for the 
investment reduce fha mortgage rates while increasing the ceiling 
of loan amounts in many cases and set limits on the percentage of 
income paid by tenants receiving rental assistance 
lowincome tax credits for developers set to expire next year 
would be made permanent through provisions set forth in an earlier 
bill cosponsored by senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
and sen john danforth rmo 
there have been no specific commitments from the bush 
administration but housing secretary jack kemp likes many of the 
bills elements is very interested in the measure according to 
cranston who has met with kemp several times 
were going to enact housing legislation this session 
declared mitchell 
the subcommittee will begin hearings on the proposal next month 
as the cranston bill came out of the senate rep henry gonzalez 
dtexas chairman of the house subcommittee on housing and community 
development held the second in a series of allday hearings on the 
need for permanent housing for the homeless 
earlier in the month sen al gore dtenn challenged bush to 
show the leadership this issue demands and called for a white 
house conference on homelessness 
in addition sen barbara mikulski dmd is set to challenge 
the bush administration if it intends to replace rental assistance 
certificates with vouchers as proposed in former president reagans 
budget 
mikulski has released a study by the general accounting office 
the research arm of congress which presents compelling evidence 
that the administrations housing voucher program will cost as much 
as 96 billion more over the next 12 years than the rental 
assistance certificate program it was designed to replace 
and rep tom lantos dcalif said kemp has agreed to appear 
before the government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing which lantos chairs kemps appearance would follow his 
expected selection as chairman of the interagency council for the 
homeless 
the council the governments chief coordinating agency for 
homelessness programs was roundly criticized by lawmakers last week 
as a donothing panel under reagan

secretary of state james a baker iii appears 
close to making a decision on sending a special ambassador to the 
usbacked rebels fighting the sovietsupported regime in 
afghanistan administration officials say 
the move is aimed at broadening us influence among the 
longfeuding moslem rebel factions the officials said over the 
weekend 
a white house official said the envoys role could be seen as 
attempting to limit pakistans influence among the afghan 
guerrillas in particular its backing of radical moslem 
fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions 
he said baker has the matter under consideration and that he 
may be close to a decision point 
the official who spoke on condition his name not be used said 
the proposal is still on bakers desk and has not yet reached 
president bush 
a state department official who also spoke privately said the 
proposal has been under consideration for a long time but said 
he was uncertain of the timing of the decision or its possible 
announcement 
the first official emphasized that the move would not imply us 
recognition of any interim government established by the rebels 
also known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
civil war has ravaged afghanistan for more than 11 years and 
divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting the 
seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in 
pakistan but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for 
power and attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a postwar 
islamic republic of afghanistan 
throughout the war the united states has funneled aid to the 
rebels through pakistan that nation has directed the lions share 
of support to one of the most successful rebel groups the radical 
fundamentalist unit headed by gulbuddin hekmatyar 
he not only has sought domination over the other groups but also 
advocates restructuring afghan society along strict fundamentalist 
islamic lines 
the soviets who entered afghanistan in 1979 withdrew in 
february under an agreement mediated by the united nations 
last week the soviets renewed arms shipments to the communist 
regime in kabul saying they will continue to supply equipment to 
president najibs troops as long as pakistan and the united states 
supply the guerrillas 
last year sen gordon humphrey rnh pushed a law through 
congress that required the appointment of a special ambassador 
on friday senators renewed the call for the appointment in a 
resolution 
the resolution which was referred to the senate foreign 
relations committee also said the united states should not cut the 
amount of military equipment it gives the afghan guerrillas until it 
is absolutely clear that the soviet union has ended assistance 
to its proxies 
sen robert byrd dwva authored the resolution which was 
signed by senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and 
minority leader bob dole rkan among others

the rightwing republican 
nationalist alliance claimed victory in the presidential vote 
sunday a day of fierce clashes between leftist rebels and troops 
that left at least 29 people dead 
three journalists were among those killed 
the alliance known as arena said its candidate gained more than 
50 percent of the vote enough to avoid a runoff election next 
month against the incumbent christian democrats 
we are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors roberto 
daubuisson founder of arena told a news conference 
arena presidential candidate alfredo cristiani said the party had 
results from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured of 
victory 
the us embassy which surveyed 21 polling places in san 
salvador that it considered would predict results for the entire 
city found arena getting 605 percent the christian democrats 317 
percent and the leftist democratic convergence 57 percent 
is it now quite possible that arena is headed for a firstround 
victory the embassy said in a cable addressed to secretary of 
state james a baker iii that was obtained by the associated press 
the document which cited no raw vote figures predicted turnout 
would be 58 percent 
election authorities said preliminary official results were 
expected monday 
a rebel boycott and scattered firefights between guerrillas and 
troops trimmed the voter turnout 
six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as the 
rebels tried to disrupt the voting according to col emilio ponce 
chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
two salvadoran journalists and a dutch television cameraman also 
were killed one during clash at a rebelheld town and the others 
at military checkpoints 
christian democratic candidate fidel chavez mena had said he 
expected to do better in the countryside than in the capital but 
his partys headquarters was virtually deserted sunday night and the 
party provided no results 
we have the 50 percent that is needed to win and i can assure 
you there will be no second round said daubuisson i am proud 
to have been able to carry such a good and capable man as freddy 
cristiani to the presidency 
critics claim arena is still controlled by daubuisson a former 
army major who has been accused of having links with rightist death 
squads daubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations 
there was no official word on turnout but a spot check of 
several polling places in san salvador showed about 60 percent of 
registered voters cast ballots 
ana guadalupe martinez a rebel spokeswoman in mexico city said 
enough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that no 
election could be held without participation by the rebel farabundo 
marti national liberation front 
she said no polling places or voters had been attacked as the 
guerrillas had pledged but rebel assaults on government 
installations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls 
the guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotaged 
telephone lines and electricity which cut or restricted power to 80 
percent of the country 
roman catholic churches were crowded with palm sunday worshipers 
and by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations in 
san salvador turnout was light in many smaller towns 
with these problems its better to stay home said jose 
carlos ortiz 23 he spoke in front of his home in the capital as 
guerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocks 
away 
sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the guazapa volcano 
a guerrilla stronghold north of san salvador as troops fought 
insurgents in the 9yearold war that has claimed an estimated 
70000 lives 
there were seven presidential candidates and the three major ones 
were cristiani chavez mena and guillermo ungo of the democratic 
convergence 
christian democrat president jose napoleon duartes fiveyear 
term ends june 1 duarte barred by law from running for 
reelection is dying of liver cancer 
cristiani has vowed to follow freemarket policies and reduce 
state intervention in the economy his party promised to step up the 
war if the guerrillas do not agree to lay down their arms 
chavez mena a lawyer heads the christian democrats 
conservative wing he struggled against opposition charges of 
corruption in the usbacked government and inability of his party 
to deal with the economy and the civil war 
leaders of the democratic convergence maintain formal links with 
the guerrillas this is the first election since 1977 in which 
socialist candidates have competed 
about 183 million people out of a population of 5 million were 
eligible to vote and polls were open in 243 of the countrys 262 
municipalities nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting 
stations because election officials deemed those rebelheld zones 
too dangerous 
in san sebastian 30 miles east of the capital turnout was light 
the people are frightened said william doherty of the 
american aflcio there is no question that the intimidation by 
the guerrillas is working 
doherty is one of 21 congressmen state politicians and private 
citizens named by the white house to be official election observers 
he said turnout was far less than during three previous 
elections he attended this decade 
cornel lagrouw a cameraman for dutch national television was 
killed as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the eastern 
town of san francisco javier said bill gentile a us photographer 
for newsweek 
lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two drivers 
who were in the town the others dragged him away and fled in two 
cars but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite press 
markings and white flags on the vehicles gentile said 
two salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriously 
wounded when security forces fired on their vehicles the armed 
forces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks 
in the march 1988 elections for the national assembly arena won 
32 seats the christian democrats 23 and the national conciliation 
party six but a group called the authentic christian movement split 
from the christian democrats taking 16 seats from duartes faction 
the next legislative elections are set for march 1991

theyre at it again those bickering states who 
share the hudson river and a hearty animosity theyve battled over 
westway the statue of liberty and the new york giants 
the latest provocation in the new yorknew jersey border war a 
new york tax law passed in 1987 and discovered just recently which 
will tax jerseyans new york income at a rate based on their total 
income 
translation if you make 25000 a year in new york and your 
spouse makes 75000 annually west of the hudson youre taxed on 
the 25000 as if youre in the 100000 bracket 
adding insult to usury or so say the jerseyans new york gov 
mario cuomo invited irate new jerseyans to sue and suggested any 
commuter who didnt like the law could quit and leave those jobs 
for new yorkers 
after pulling his foot from his mouth cuomo called new jersey 
gov thomas kean and apologized but it was too late to stop angry 
residents of the garden state from some nasty cuomobashing 
his arrogance has infuriated new jerseyans said new jersey 
republican assemblyman charles hardwick who has filed suit on 
behalf of his state hes supposed to be the compassionate 
governor hes made it clear his compassion ends at the hudson 
river 
agreed carl golden keans press secretary to people on this 
side o the hudson commuters legislators whoever this is seen 
as another attempt to step on the people of new jersey 
the level of bile gets even higher among those who will be 
actually hit by the tax 
can you believe this guy we dont get education dont get 
welfare what do we get for our tax dollars asked commuter thomas 
stokes of middletown nj we get sewer service and that winds 
up on the jersey shore anyway 
stokes heads up the taxpayers revolt an ad hoc committee that 
has encouraged new jersey commuters to stop spending money in new 
york until the law is rescinded 
they did a real pearl harbor job on us they passed this in 87 
to take effect in 88 and told us about it in 89 said stokes 
but this dispute is just the latest round in a seemingly endless 
struggle between the two neighbors connecticut commuters affected 
by the tax arent screaming for cuomos head but then theyve 
been able to stand by and enjoy these nynj spats 
new jerseys courting of new york businesses and the citys 
subsequent battle to keep the companies home a highlight of this 
continuing competition a newspaper ad depicting mayor edward koch 
hammer in hand boarding up the holland tunnel to prevent defections 
the moves to the meadowlands in east rutherford nj by the 
new york giants from yankee stadium and the new york jets from 
shea stadium a split decision in this fight new jersey got the 
teams but both still use new york in their names 
both sides claimed the statue of liberty which stands in new 
york harbor between the states the courts finally ruled in new 
yorks favor another slap at the garden state the statue stands 
with its back to jersey city 
new york complains new jersey factories are poisoning its air 
new jersey claims new yorks staten island landfill known as 
mount koch in the garden state is polluting waterways 
a delegation of jersey congressmen helped sink westway the 2 
billion highway development planned for manhattans west side one 
of the controversial projects biggest boosters gov mario cuomo 
after that defeat the governor pointed directly at new jersey 
and affixed the blame the people from jersey did it in response 
to a war with new york city obviously that war continues 
but cuomo doesnt have only bad things to say about new jersey

hundreds of people rallied in moscow to vent anger 
at the communist party elites alleged campaign to discredit ousted 
city party boss boris n yeltsin a maverick reformer who is running 
for national office 
in a rare display of political passion about 3000 people 
marched on city hall sunday to drum up support for the popular 
candidate police made no move to break up the unauthorized 
gathering 
yeltsin is seeking a seat in the new national parliament the 
congress of peoples deputies in elections next sunday that will 
represent the countrys first experiment with contested elections 
hes against the party mafia and thats why the party mafia is 
against him declared marcher taras osipov a 65yearold retired 
engineer yeltsin is with the people and for the people 
yeltsin 58 is running to represent the soviet capital where he 
headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before 
president mikhail s gorbachev fired him for criticizing the slow 
pace of reform 
yeltsin has charged that the party machine is conspiring to 
derail his candidacy and restricting voters access to his campaign 
yeltsins opponent in the election is yevgeny brakov director of 
the zil automobile factory 
as the soviet union lurches toward sundays vote it is clear 
that gorbachevs reforms have brought amazing latitude in public 
debate to a country that only recently punished unorthodox ideas 
with harsh prison terms 
pravda reported on sunday that even gorbachev and other members 
of the partys ruling politburo failed to win unanimous support in 
their bids for seats on the new legislature 
providing unusual insight into divisions in the policymaking 
central committee the communist party newspaper said that of 641 
central committee members and alternates who voted thursday 12 
opposed gorbachevs candidacy 
yegor k ligachev reputedly a conservative force on the 
politburo recieved the most no votes of any politburo member 
78 pravda said 
the communist party and some other organizations are entitled to 
directly choose 750 of the 2250 members of the legislature the 
other 1500 will be chosen march 26 in nationwide elections 
although party members proposed 31000 candidates for its 100 
seats in the legislature the central committee chose to nominate 
all 100 people suggested by the politburo then elected all their 
nominees 
the central committee vote showed there is considerable 
opposition not only to ligachev but also to politburo members 
closely linked to gorbachev prior to gorbachev such votes were 
customarily unanimous 
thousands of yeltsin supporters had planned to rally sunday at 
moscows gorky park when they were told permission for the meeting 
had been refused they set off for the city center 
their anger was kindled by a central committee decision last week 
to form a special commission to investigate charges that yeltsin 
who is still a central committee member opposes some party policies 
yeltsin won support from many muscovites with a campaign against 
corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges available to the 
government and party elite 
at one point during the march scores of police officers barred 
the crowd from getting near the kremlin the seat of soviet power 
police and kgb agents along the route directed the marchers but 
made no attempt to halt them even though their protest violated 
city regulations that require seven days notice of any 
demonstration 
the street resounded with the chant of hands off yeltsin as 
the marchers approached city hall there a cordon of police barred 
their way 
in unison the protesters shook their fists and chanted their 
demand to meet with lev n zaikov a politburo member and the 
current moscow party boss 
zaikov leads the party machine yeltsin claims is working for his 
defeat 
one proyeltsin speaker near the buildings doorway shouted 
shame on our soviet democracy shame on our leaders 
when the elderly man called for a oneday strike across moscow if 
yeltsin is defeated the crowd roared and raised its hands in 
approval 
yeltsin told the central committee on oct 21 1987 that faith 
in gorbachevs reforms was waning and gorbachev was becoming the 
subject of intolerable glorification 
yeltsin who had been named moscow party boss in december 1985 
and a nonvoting member of the politburo two months later lost both 
posts as a result of his remarks 
he was later named to a ministerialrank job in the state 
construction committee

americans widely expect the federal government to 
fail in its search for a lasting solution to the savings and loan 
crisis a national survey by media general and the associated press 
has found 
the poll of 1108 adults also revealed a considerable lack of 
confidence in the beleaguered sampl industry only half the 
respondents called thrifts safe and a third of those with sampl 
deposits feared losing their money 
half those surveyed favored greater government regulation of the 
industry and a majority preferred bailing out failing thrifts to 
closing them but most opposed having the public bear the brunt of 
the costs 
federal insurance is insufficient to cover accounts at the 
estimated 350 savings and loans that are failing and the government 
so far has taken over 166 of them while congress and the white house 
devise a rescue plan the nation has 2955 savings and loan 
associations in all 
president bush has proposed using 50 billion in 
governmentbacked bonds to help cover the accounts in addition to 
40 billion pledged last year to sell or prop up failed thrifts but 
in the poll just 27 percent said the government should pay most of 
the costs of salvaging the industry 
instead a 42 percent plurality said the sampl industry should bear 
most of the costs by paying higher insurance premiums on its 
accounts a lesser feature of bushs plan just 14 percent supported 
a fee on sampl depositors an idea the administration considered and 
dropped 
whatever the eventual plan only 31 percent believed the 
government will find a longterm solution to the crisis thirtynine 
percent expected only a temporary solution and 19 percent 
predicted no solution the rest expressed no opinion 
the survey did find support for the government program of giving 
sampls financial assistance to attract buyers of those who had an 
opinion 51 percent favored such bailouts while 29 percent preferred 
closing down failing thrifts and paying off their depositors 
of the 35 percent of respondents who had sampl accounts only 9 
percent said they were withdrawing money because of the industrys 
problems but a fifth said they were considering that step and as 
many said they were holding off on new deposits 
sampls have sustained record withdrawals lately but federal 
analysts have chiefly blamed the higher interest rates that are 
available elsewhere rather than concern about the industrys 
financial problems 
but while the poll found that the sampl crisis had not yet prompted 
many depositors to reduce their accounts others said they were 
staying away of those who have not had money in sampls during the 
past year 18 percent said they were keeping their money out because 
of the thrifts woes 
the industry problems were widely recognized only 53 percent 
overall regarded sampls as a safe place to keep their money compared 
with 93 percent who saw banks as safe thirtysix percent called 
sampls unsafe and 11 percent werent sure 
a 48 percent plurality blamed the sampl crisis on bad management by 
the thrifts among other respondents with an opinion 21 percent 
blamed general economic problems and 11 percent blamed fraud by sampl 
managers 
only 10 percent blamed a lack of government regulation but 53 
percent nonetheless favored bolstering goverment regulation twice 
the number who said current regulation was about right 
the survey conducted march 615 found relatively little 
variation in opinion across the demographic spectrum in the south 
where thrifts have fared worst 49 percent rated them safe in the 
northeast 56 percent called them safe that gap slightly exceeded 
the margin of error plus or minus 3 percentage points 
the poll was conducted by the ap and media general inc a 
communications company based in richmond va that publishes the 
richmond timesdispatch the richmond news leader the tampa fla 
tribune and the winstonsalem nc journal and operates tv

discoverys astronauts fresh after 
a day of rampr today were briefing nasa on their mission which 
the shuttle apparently weathered better than its predecessors 
discovery remained at edwards air force base calif where high 
winds hampered crews working sunday to get the craft ready for its 
ride atop a jumbo jet to florida officials however expected it to 
leave on time friday 
after their desert landing at edwards early saturday the five 
astronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families 
they were going back to work today briefing the space agency on 
the shuttles performance and the experiments conducted during the 
nearly flawless fiveday mission said steve nesbitt a johnson 
space center spokesman 
a preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection 
tiles will need to be replaced in contrast to the last shuttle 
flight in december when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged 
this is one of the best yet said cindy lodge who works on 
the shuttles tile system weve had no major damages theres a 
few dings around the nose cap nothing severe at all 
the tiles shield orbiters during the fiery reentry into earths 
atmosphere 
five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure 
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped ms lodge 
said only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced she 
said 
the brakes which have caused problems during previous shuttle 
landings also performed well engineers said 
the brakes looked the best ever no signs of any heat there 
was no damage whatsoever said nasas tip talone who coordinates 
processing of the orbiter for each flight 
the mission ended with a pictureperfect landing that was watched 
by a nearrecord crowd of 460000 
five hundred people cheered the astronauts return to houston 
later in the afternoon 
weve had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight 
said mission specialist james f buchli who had been on two 
previous discovery missions 
the flight was commanded by michael l coats who had flown one 
previous shuttle mission the other crew members pilot john e 
blaha and mission specialists robert c springer and james p bagian 
made their first voyages 
discoverys flight the 28th shuttle mission was the third since 
challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on jan 28 1986 seven 
astronauts died in the explosion which brought shuttle flights to a 
halt for nearly three years 
discovery blasted off from cape canaveral fla a week ago 
today six hours into the mission the crew accomplished its primary 
mission the deployment of a 100 million communications satellite 
the satellite completes a network that will enable the national 
aeronautics and space administration to have nearly constant contact 
with space shuttles and other satellites 
the astronauts also photographed the earth their film will be 
edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man 
and nature 
four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments were killed 
shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their 
intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity many of the 32 
fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to 
see how space affected embryo development 
other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a 
project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in 
microgravity the results will be studied by the researchers who 
designed the experiments 
the only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure 
reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the 
orbiter the astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground 
controllers corrected the difficulty 
the next shuttle to fly atlantis is expected to be rolled out 
to a cape canaveral launch pad wednesday for its scheduled april 28 
liftoff the atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map 
the surface of venus

the devastating drought of 1988 is still 
fresh on farmers minds and insurers say theyre getting a bumper 
crop of business this year a lot earlier than usual 
more than 100 million acres of farm land are expected to be 
insured this year compared with about 75 million acres in 1988 
says gene gantz executive director of the american association of 
crop insurers 
it is a gigantic record he said adding that up to 150 
million acres could be covered if conditions remain dry through the 
april 15 deadline for signing up for federally subsidized 
multiperil crop insurance 
rainfall has been in short supply so far this year scaring many 
farmers who watched their fields and pocketbooks shrivel during last 
years long hot and dry summer across the farm belt 
the drought resulted in a 39 billion federal bailout 
when the house burns down down the street most people get out 
their homeowners policy to check and see if theyre covered gantz 
said in a telephone interview from the washington dc office of 
the trade group and if you dont have a policy you get one 
gantz said some insurers already are reporting two to three times 
their normal farm business 
joy tegels general manager of agribusiness insurance 
consultants ltd in the central iowa community of nevada said crop 
insurance business already is up 25 percent 
she said that in iowa where 44 percent of the crop land was 
covered by federal crop insurance last year an estimated 60 percent 
of crops would be covered this year if theres no substantial 
rainfall soon 
we have not yet seen the deluge were going to see if the 
weather pattern stays the same she said our office will be 
like sears youll have to take a number to be served 
the selling point this year said tegels is that people 
collected on federal crop insurance policies 
the federal crop insurance corp reported paying claims of nearly 
12 billion on 435 million in premiums collected last year said 
michael forgash a spokesman in washington for the 
governmentsupported program the program insures against drought 
losses and protects against insect infestation plant disease and 
damage from hail winds and flooding 
the biggest payout to any state went to north dakota where 550 
in claims were paid for every 100 in premiums collected covering a 
total of 1871 million in damages 
iowa ranked second with 1277 million or 320 in claims for 
every 100 in premiums collected 
congress has warned that it wont be so willing to stage a rescue 
this year for those who failed to insure themselves against losses 
last year 
i wouldnt count on it in 1989 said rep tom tauke riowa 
tauke said congress was able to help droughtplagued farmers last 
year because there were a couple of billion dollars to play with 
after a miscalculation of the cost of the farm program and it was 
an election year 
fueling the pressure to buy coverage was a requirement that those 
who received federal emergency assistance last year be insured this 
year 
bankers too are demanding borrowers to carry drought policies 
as collateral on crop loans 
federal crop insurance plans allow farmers to choose coverage 
that will pay the equivalent of 50 percent 65 percent or 75 percent 
of the 10year average yields on production 
forgash said premium rates wont change this year as a result of 
last years heavy claims he said the system is not geared to 
reacting quickly to such payouts 
it would be patently unfair to recover an entire catastrophic 
loss in one insurance year he said 
the rush to insure apparently has not been affected by 
allegations last year that an insurance company had reneged on 
droughtinsurance policies 
the chubb corp of new jersey wound up agreeing to pay 48 
million to settle a classaction lawsuit on behalf of about 8000 
farmers in 10 states

a cree indian driven by a vision has led a 
2700mile run to meet with museum officials and request that a 
clothwrapped bundle sacred to the tribe be returned to his people 
in western canada 
weve been running every mile of the way its indian 
custom to send foot messengers jim thunder 38 said friday as he 
and two companions neared the american museum of natural history 
at stake is a bundle assembled by chief big bear more than 150 
years ago to give his people spiritual guidance and protection 
complicating the quest is a competing claim for the relic and 
museums reluctance to part with it 
in 1979 i had a dream in which chief big bear appeared to me 
and offered a ceremonial pipe with the request that i bring the 
bundle home from new york city thunder said i made a vow that 
i would do it 
the calicowrapped bundle about the size of two opened hands 
and containing a bear claw a clump of sweet grass and a plug of 
tobacco was acquired by the museum in 1934 when a son of big bear 
gave it to an anthropologist for safe keeping said museum spokesman 
herb kurz 
the bundle never put on display has remained in storage as part 
of a collection studied by scholars kurz said its also made 
available to indians who occasionally want to see it 
thunder saying the sacred object is homesick maintains it 
should be returned to the native americans who would use it in their 
religious ceremonies 
kurz said staff anthropologists would meet with thunder on 
wednesday but the spokesman held out little hope the museum would 
surrender the bundle 
this object was given to the museum by a son of the chief big 
bear he asked the museum to keep it kurz said the museum 
doesnt usually give away objects that were acquired legitimately 
thunder views himself as big bears greatgreat grandson but 
admits hes not a blood relative in 1985 i was adopted by an old 
indian woman who was a great granddaughter of big bear he said 
indians who oppose thunder have asked the museum not to give him 
the bundle 
we want it were the descendants of this great man russell 
standing rock 36 said in a telephone interview from his home on 
the rocky boy indian reservation in montana he is my greatgreat 
grandfather 
we dont even know jim thunder he said 
standing rock said his family and other indians in montana have 
asked the museum to reject thunders claims and give the object to 
them instead 
but thunder said im not doing this because im a descendant 
of chief big bear im doing it because big bear requested of me to 
bring this bundle home this is not something i chose for myself 
big bear who created the bundle when he was 13 wore it into 
battle in 1885 when the cree joined canadian rebel louis riel and 
the metis indians of central saskatchewan to fight white settlers 
legend has it that the bundle helped big bear and his people escape 
after the revolt failed 
in the more than 50 years the museum has had the bundle no one 
made any attempt to return it to the indian people before thunder 
began his run from edmonton on sept 1 
thunder a twopack a day cigarette smoker and companions 
lindsay cote and henry basil set out with a pace car some money 
and words of discouragement from critics who said they had little 
chance of success 
we were a determined little bunch we left on faith and 135 
thunder said 
throughout they depended on people they met for money food and 
shelter at the mohawk reservation near montreal indian leaders 
raised nearly 5000 for the effort he said 
they occasionally had to wait out blizzards but on the days they 
could travel they averaged 20 miles a day taking turns running 
across southern canada in a series of relays 
if the object is surrendered by the museum a council of three 
chiefs three elders and descendants of big bear will meet to decide 
who will be named the keeper of the bundle thunder said 
to us its not just a historical artifact it has a lot of 
ceremonial value what you call spiritual significance thunder 
said 
and if the museum refuses 
were going to honor that thunder said were not here to 
have a protest rally go on a hunger strike or do anything drastic 
its just a simple request and all we want is an answer

president roh taewoo announced today 
that he is postponing a national referendum on his performance a 
campaign promise and claimed leftist forces are trying to 
overthrow the government 
in a nationally televised address roh said the nation faces a 
major threat from radical groups and that going ahead with the 
referendum now would risk plunging south korea into new chaos 
violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the 
government he said 
the former general said the referendum would be held sometime in 
the future but gave no indication of when or how roh had been 
expected to announce this week that the referendum would be held 
about april 12 
it was not clear if roh was backing away from the referendum 
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the 
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new 
elections some government officials had expressed concern about 
rohs ability to win a referendum 
the government had said earlier that roh would not resign if he 
was defeated but some administration officials conceded a defeat 
would put pressure on roh to call elections 
critics said roh could not win a referendum roh said on 
television that it would not be of help to the country to hold a 
national referendum for my performance in office at this juncture 
the main opposition parties said they accepted rohs decision 
but would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat 
on any other promises to bring in full democracy 
we feel sorry for the people to have such a president who has 
unilaterally postponed the referendum without presenting a concrete 
alternative said the reunification democratic party one of the 
two main opposition groups 
dissidents groups denounced rohs decision saying it proved the 
government never intended to hold a referendum and proved that the 
administration knew it could not win a popular vote 
the united national democratic movement the nations main 
dissident alliance said it would proceed with plans to campaign for 
rohs ouster 
rohs postponement of the referendum is an act deceiving the 
people the alliance said 
several hundred radical students shouting punish roh taewoo 
attacked two police stations with firebombs today in the southern 
city of kwangju the south korean news agency yonhap reported no 
arrests or injuries were reported 
radicals have organized a series of violent antigovernment 
protests but they lack broad public support 
leftist forces are trying to use the midterm appraisal as a 
foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system roh said 
roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office 
in late 1987 but many south koreans distrust the government because 
of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former president chun 
doohwan 
the party of peace and democracy of kim daejung welcomed the 
referendum delay the reunification democratic party of kim 
youngsam said it would accept only a temporary delay 
kim youngsam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting 
roh would lose kim daejung opposed a referendum apparently 
because kim youngsams party had overtaken his party in opinion 
polls and could win presidential elections 
the kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the 
december 1987 elections allowing roh to win with 36 percent of the 
vote roh promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum 
after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate 
his performance

a film proposal to depict the story of the 
late mob leader meyer lansky reportedly triggered a struggle between 
two powerful mafia families according to federal court documents 
recently unsealed fbi affidavits revealed evidence that new 
yorks genovese crime family wanted to win the lead role for actor 
james caan the los angeles times reported sunday 
a prominent hollywood executive backing a different script about 
lansky turned for help to the rival gambino crime family according 
to the affidavits 
the present status of the rival concepts werent reported 
the involvement of the genovese and gambino crime families 
demonstrated the fascination mobsters have with their image as well 
as with potential profits from boxoffice successes the times said 
the bickering over the lansky film began in 1987 when the 
untouchables a film about treasury agent elliot ness campaign 
against al capone already had grossed nearly 75 million the 
newspaper said 
lansky died in 1983 at age 81 as what investigators called the 
undisputed patriarch of an organized crime syndicate founded on 
drugs loan sharking gambling and prostitution 
martin bacow a writer producer and labor negotiator claimed to 
have known lansky personally and said in 1987 he already had a 
lansky script in hand 
eugene f giaquinto then president of mca incs home video 
division tentatively offered to pay bacow 45 million for the 
video and paytelevision rights to the film if it was made the 
newspaper said 
but bacow said caan was proposing his own lansky project and 
allegedly told several reputed members of the los angeles mafia 
family during a dinner party that the rival movie would never be 
distributed according to the newspaper 
caans attorney donald e santarelli said the actor dined with 
mafia figures but neither made nor was aware of any attempt to 
interfere with bacows project 
he called the dinners actors research saying caan has had a 
fascination with organized crime figures since his oscarnominated 
performance in the godfather 
there is no evidence he knew that the mob tried to intercede on 
his behalf the newspaper said 
but the fbi is investigating whether genovese family members 
tried to pressure bacow and giaquinto 
federal agents also contend giaquinto said in a telephone call 
that he had thwarted genovese pressure tactics by getting help from 
the gambino crime family 
giaquinto was unavailable for comment sunday he was put on 
forced leave of absence from mca and his attorney richard p crain 
jr does not have a local telephone listing a call to mca was not 
answered

closed

leftist rebels who have been at war with the usbacked government 
for nine years 
this nation wants to govern itself with the most powerful 
ammunition there is the vote the republican governor said 
despite widespread fighting between government troops and the 
guerrillas the observers were never exposed to combat or attack 
officials said 
the observers said they talked to voters election workers and 
soldiers 
what we have observed in el salvador is a passionate commitment 
of a people to participate in the democratic process despite being 
faced with intimidation threats violence and death from persons 
outside the political process the report said 
still observer william doherty of the aflcio said rebel 
intimidation hindered the voting we have still got a long way to 
go until we call this a democracy he said 
the white house named the official delegation of congress 
members state politicans and private citizens the us embassy 
selected the precincts the observers visited by motorcade and 
helicopter

appeared to be conducted under conditions designed to prevent fraud

lot of people voting today we saw nothing but essentially a civic 
fiesta 
delegation member rep robert k dornan rcalif said he 
welcomed a victory by the rightwing nationalist republican 
alliance or arena over the incumbent christian democrats 
now i see that the momentum has changed to the arena party 
dornan said im a conservative its time for my guys to win 
rep tony coelho dcalif said arena supporters apparently 
turned out strongly lining up at polling stations in the capital 
and countryside it looks like they the voters were chosen by 
the arena party he said 
coelho said disputes may arise in washington after the election 
because current policies have not brought an end to the war and 
congress will need to debate whether military and economic aid to el 
salvador should continue at present levels

the top judges in connecticuts federal 
district state supreme court and state appellate court are women 
but the members of this unique judicial troika say women still have 
ground to make up 
ellen bree burns is chief judge for the us district court in 
connecticut ellen ash peters is chief justice of the state supreme 
court and antoinette l dupont is chief judge of the appellate court 
the state attorney general also is a woman clarine nardi riddle 
was promoted to acting attorney general when her former boss joseph 
lieberman won a us senate seat in november 
no other state has a similar combination of top female jurists 
and the judges say the distinction underscores not how far women 
have come but how far they have to go 
overall one cant be overjoyed by the fact that a few of us do 
have positions that are conspicuous said peters 58 who was 
appointed to the supreme court in 1978 and became chief justice in 
1984 
theres more to be done and the fact that im the chief 
justice antoinette dupont is the chief judge in the appellate 
court ellen bree burns is the chief judge in the federal district 
and clarine nardi riddle is attorney general doesnt mean its 
over 
the countrys only other female state supreme court chief justice 
is dorothy comstock riley in michigan 
in the federal system judith w rogers serves as chief judge for 
the district of columbia court of appeals 
of the state appellate courts only dupont serves as a chief 
judge said philip a lattimore staff director for the national 
association of women judges in williamsburg va 
nationally 1200 of 25000 state judges are women these include 
30 women supreme court justices and 66 appellate judges lattimore 
said 
we are at a point in our history where women are entering the 
state courts of last resort supreme courts he said 
the ranks of female jurists is bound to increase because about 
half of the students in law schools now are women lattimore said 
elaine martin an assistant political science professor at 
eastern michigan state university said women are bringing a fresh 
perspective to courtrooms 
some say they are more compassionate and others say they are 
more attuned to gender bias said martin who has a 10000 grant 
from the american center for women in politics to study the 
influence of women in the nations state supreme courts 
a state task force is preparing a report on gender bias in 
connecticut courts based on testimony gathered during public 
hearings last year 
the report is expected to cite examples of bias including male 
attorneys frequently addressing female witnesses by their first 
names while being more formal with male witnesses 
members of the general assemblys judiciary committee have asked 
female judicial candidates whether their family life would interfere 
with judicial affairs one candidate was asked if she would be able 
to meet mortgage payments on a judges salary 
the three judges say signs of continuing gender bias dont 
suprise them they saw plenty while breaking into the legal 
profession in the 1950s 
you were often told we dont hire women because our clients 
dont like women lawyers said 60yearold dupont recalling her 
days as an attorney in new york city 
burns 65 recalled the cold reception she got at lawyers 
function years ago 
i went to a new haven county bar association meeting and they 
told me i was in the wrong place she said i assured them that 
if this was a bar association meeting then i was in the right 
place

rioters broke windows and spraypainted 
buildings in a moslem neighborhood of this northern city with 
slogans of support for salman rushdie whose novel the satanic 
verses has enraged many moslems 
reporters saw windows smashed small trees pulled up paint 
sprayed on cars homes and religious centers and painted slogans 
demanding rushdie be left in peace no injuries were reported after 
the rampage sunday night

after protests in india pakistan and other countries against the 
book ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on feb 14 called on moslems to 
seek out and kill rushdie 
the novelist a naturalized briton born to a moslem family in 
india has since gone into hiding 
the sheffield neighborhood where the rioting occurred is mainly 
inhabited by pakistanis the words pakis die were scrawled on 
a mosque 
police said they made no immediate arrests 
community relations in this area are good we cannot say what 
is behind the incidents at this stage said a police spokesman who 
would not give his name

an organized gang said city councilman choudry walayat

affair it is very alarming 
at least 19 people have been killed in india and pakistan in 
riots protesting the novel

the socialists wrested control of several large 
cities from conservative and centerright parties in municipal 
elections that party leaders said represented a vote of confidence 
in president francois mitterand 
its a very beautiful and very ample victory for the president 
the government and the presidential majority socialist premier 
michel rocard said of the results in sundays vote 
it is the first time that we have seen a government receive a 
powerful popular encouragement during the municipal elections 
said socialist interior minister pierre joxe 
the first round of the municipal elections was held last week in 
communities where no slate won 50 percent of the vote then all 
slates that won at least 10 percent were eligible to participate in 
the second round 
turnout in this ninth trip to the polls for the french in less 
than a year was estimated at between 72 and 735 percent 
conservative bastions such as strasbourg mulhouse brest 
dunkirk orleans blois avignon and quimper fell into socialist 
hands on sunday the right made some inroads into leftist territory 
but in general won fewer smaller cities 
many of the conservatives problems were caused by the extreme 
right national front which siphoned votes from the traditional 
rightist parties in the runoffs the conservative rally for the 
republic rpr and the centerright union for french democracy udf 
refused to deal with the national front for secondround support 
it would be an exaggeration to believe that we are seeing a 
grassroots wave for the presidential majority said rpr secretary 
general alain juppe its true that the socialist party is 
retaking a part of the terrain that it had lost in 1983 but only a 
part 
the overall number of municipalities with a population of more 
than 30000 lost by the right was small but the right lost 
important cities while taking smaller less important ones from the 
left 
the right had made serious gains in the countrys city councils 
in 1983 two years after the socialists came to power nationally 
said former conservative premier jacques chirac mayor of paris 
who turned in one of the few smashing victories of the night on 
the national level we have seen the socialists win back cities they 
lost six years ago and it is a victory for them on the other hand 
the number of abstentionists the large number of votes for the 
ecologist and national front slates expresses a malaise 
perhaps the socialists most satisfying victory came in 
strasbourg where they ousted an incumbent centerright mayor in an 
election in which the ecologist slate also won 12 percent 
the results confirmed the leftist trend that reelected 
mitterrand last spring and gave him a leftist majority in the 
national assembly frequently local elections are used as a means 
of protesting government policy but that was not the case this 
year races largely were fought on local issues 
there was a little good news on the right however chirac who 
won a grand slam in 1983 by taking all 20 of paris districts 
repeated the feat despite a cliffhanger in the 20th district where 
national front leader jeanmarie le pens slate drew away a lot of 
votes 
it was satisfying for chirac who took a battering from 
mitterrand in presidential elections last may 
another grand slam was registered by michel noir a 
conservative deputy in the national assembly and former foreign 
trade minister noir a dynamic 45yearold politician won all 
nine of the districts in the southeastern city of lyon frances 
thirdlargest municipality defeating a centerright incumbent 
le pen said the traditional rights strategy of refusing to deal 
with the national front had failed yet again the national front 
has shown by its sucess that it accepting the national front is 
unavoidable 
the fronts campaign focusings largely on antiimmigration and 
law and order issues

a 43hour hostage siege ended in tragedy 
when a mentally deranged gunman killed his girlfriend 
critically wounded her sister and then fatally shot himself 
authorities said 
the bodies were discovered sunday evening after police fired tear 
gas into the heavily barricaded house 
we thought that it got to the point after 40 hours of 
negotiating that we had done all that we could and we were concerned 
about the lives of the two remaining hostages said police chief 
mike walton 
police fired the first of two tear gas volleys into the house 
about 20 minutes after the gunman douglas dougie thomas had 
discarded the phone he had been using to talk with police walton 
said 
the negotiations got to the point where it wasnt 
negotiating walton said he never had any demands he never had 
anything he was mentally deranged 
police rushed the house after they heard thomas singing walton 
said two wounded hostages were found by the front door under 
several quilts the chief said 
thomas and his girlfriend karen lambert both 20 were dead of 
gunshot wounds when they arrived at st johns hospital said 
sangamon county coroner norman richter 
ms lamberts 14yearold sister nicole was in critical 
condition today after surgery for a gunshot wound to the head 
hospital spokeswoman agnes hayner said 
during the standoff thomas released unharmed his girlfriends 
4yearold daughter katrina lambert after police cut off 
electricity and gas to the house said police cmdr dave searcy 
another hostage kelisa lambert the 2monthold daughter of 
thomas and his girlfriend was released saturday police said 
police did not know what led thomas to take the hostages walton 
said 
heavily armed police had surrounded the house which searcy said 
is the home of the lambert sisters and their mother more than 30 
families were evacuated saturday from neighboring houses 
police were called to the house late friday in response to a 
report of a domestic disturbance 
police spokesman neil williamson said thomas was hospitalized 
recently for depression and police believe he had been taking 
medication that might have affected his moods 
thomas spent a year in prison for shooting two men at a dance in 
1985 a judge reduced charges of attempted murder to two counts of 
aggravated battery because a question existed about whether thomas 
intended to kill the men

a political game of musical chairs has 
some republicans fearing they could be left standing in the cold 
while the democrats plop into a gop congressional seat 
on march 28 for the second time in less than five months voters 
will elect a us house representative from northeast indianas 4th 
district 
last november the seat was again a republican shooin 
littlewatched as political interests focused on closer races 
the good fortune of two indiana republicans however may have 
changed that 
with the election of dan quayle to the vice presidency and the 
appointment of incumbent rep dan coats to fill quayles vacated 
senate seat republicans were forced to pick a special election 
candidate from a field of relative unknowns 
against the gop choice the democrats already had decided to run 
jill long a candidate with a mixed resume long already had lost 
two races for federal office both by wide margins quayle defeated 
her in 1986 to win a second senate term and coats repeated the 
drubbing in 1988 for his fifth house term 
the republicans picked dan heath a 36yearold aide to fort 
wayne mayor paul helmke heath an attorney with washington 
experience as a member of coats staff had never sought elective 
office 
he began the campaign largely unrecognized outside fort wayne 
where he had served helmkes administration as public safety 
director republicans concede long on the other hand despite her 
defeats was better known among voters when the campaign began in 
midjanuary 
with both parties predicting an extremely low voter turnout 
republicans fear a democratic candidate could slip through the lines 
theres nothing well need to do that we wont do said rich 
galen director of the national republican congressional committee 
were not going to lose this seat 
the committee has given heaths campaign access to active 
contributors help with voter turnout programs and phone banks the 
gop committee and the democratic congressional campaign committee 
may spend an estimated 50000 in cash and even more with inkind 
contributions on the campaign 
democrats concede the circumstances of a special election mean 
problems for their candidate as well a low voter turnout in a 
district that has voted 21 republican in past congressional races 
may still favor the gop and long as well as heath has had trouble 
igniting enthusiasm among party stalwarts during the relatively 
brief period between nomination and election both sides say 
neither candidate has a lengthy public record to run on or to 
attack 
long has attempted to play on a perceived resentment of 
attorneys frequently pointing out that heath holds a law degree and 
contending that washington doesnt need another lawyer 
heath reaches back more than a decade to critize long for 
supporting a local tax increase while a member of the valparaiso 
city council in the 1970s he has attempted to tag long as a 
liberal with one advertisement combining photos of long and michael 
dukakis the 1988 democratic presidential candidate whose 
unsuccessful campaign was wounded by the same label

the chrysler corp and sears roebuck amp co have 
decided not to advertise any more on nbctvs nightingales 
which has provoked criticism from women because it has shown 
scantily clad nurses 
chrysler advertised on one episode of the wednesday night series 
about student nurses because nbc owed it time said chrysler 
spokesman thomas houston 
but based on the response we got from viewers which was 
obviously negative the company reviewed the show and decided not 
to continue houston said 
sears ran a few commercials about its new pricing strategy but 
we pulled the one more that we had because we decided that the 
program did not meet our guidelines as suitable for family 
viewing said a spokeswoman kathy gucfa 
the kansas citybased american nursing association said last week 
it has circulated lists of nightingales advertisers to its 
189000 members urging them to communicate their concerns about 
the series which began jan 25 
nightingales exploits women said association spokeswoman 
carol grimaldi 
it uses nurses to show these very pretty girls in their 
underwear and in the shower grimaldi said it shows very lax 
educational standards when it does say anything about nursing 
education 
nbc responded that nightingales is a continuing drama about 
the personal lives of fictional people who happen to be nurses 
the network noted that a registered nurse reviews every script and 
consults with the production company on nursing procedures and other 
medical aspects 
its a drama about young women coming of age in los angeles 
today added nbc publicist merry aronson its very focused on 
their personal lives the hospital setting is almost an aside

earlier 
the dead girls uncle robert player said sunday that neighbors 
will never allow these people to ever live here again 
more than 40 people taunted the golub family outside the long 
island residence where the body of kelly tinyes 13 was found march 
4 
the golub family returned to the house saturday night for the 
first time since investigators ordered them out 
monsters seed of the devil get out jeered members of the 
crowd which included the dead girls father richard tinyes 
ms tinyes was seen entering the golub home march 3 but was 
never seen leaving her body was found in the basement authorities 
said investigators had ordered the golubs to vacate their house 
because it was the scene of the crime 
police have said the only two suspects in the case were the two 
golub brothers robert 21 and john 14 but no arrests have been 
made the nassau county district attorney plans to present evidence 
to a grand jury on wednesday 
the twohour verbal assault on the family began when robert golub 
left the house on foot and was followed by richard tinyes and an 
angry crowd 
a nassau county police spokesman officer charles koller said a 
patrolling officer saw golub being followed and called for 
assistance 
when golub reached a grocery store about six blocks from his 
home some of those following repeatedly called him a devil 
eight police cars arrived and officers protected golub as he 
left the store with his older sister adele who had come to pick 
him up in a car

to ms golub you are a devil for being with him 
ms golub yelled back my brothers were innocent then broke 
into sobs

and john and their mother elizabeth left the house and drove away 
about 10 minutes later their father john sr left in a 
separate car to the applause of the crowd 
the golubs destination was not known said koller 
the familys lawyer john ogrady said they pay taxes on the 
house there so why shouldnt the golubs go back home where else 
are they supposed to go should they be deprived of going home

one neighbor jack deluca told reporters were not 
vigilantes we would not have killed them we are aware they have

yasser arafat will not take part in the talks with the 
americans at the level of ambassadors said natsheh we are 
demanding that the united states upgrade the level of the talks so 
that abu ammar can take part abu ammar is an arafat nickname 
to upgrade the talks would be place them on a level 
commensurate with the developments in the region said natsheh 
who also expressed strong displeasure at the slow pace of 
the dialogue to date 
he added we look forward to serious americanpalestinian talks 
through which we can reach a just settlement that guarantees the 
palestinian peoples rights 
the dialogue began formally on dec 16 when washington lifted a 
13year ban on official dealings with the plo after arafat and the 
palestine national council which acts as a parliamentinexile 
made clear their acceptance of the state of israel and renounced 
terrorism 
the plo is seeking to create a palestinian state in the west bank 
and gaza strip where palestinians have been demonstrating for 15 
months against israels 21year military occupation 
the us ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau is the highest 
ranking american diplomat authorized to handle discussions with the 
plo 
the session in tunisia on wednesday will only be the second 
formal session but there have been informal contacts between 
pelletreau and the palestinians 
his plo counterpart in the talks has been yasser abedrabbo a 
member of the plo executive committee 
a weekend report in the kuwaiti newspaper alrai alaam said 
arafat would sit opposite pelletreau at the wednesday session 
arafat is presently in the iraqi capital of baghdad where the plo 
has military headquarters 
meanwhile salah khalaf arafats secondincommand in the 
mainstream plo group fatah was quoted as saying that no particular 
agenda has been fixed for the wednesday session 
khalaf in statements published in the saudi arabian newspaper 
okaz said the talks will be open to deal with all issues and 
measures related to developments of the palestinian case and the 
practical american steps to solve the problem 
khalaf also disclosed that arafat will be holding a summit 
session with president francois mitterrand of france in egypt in 
april 
under the plo umbrella are several organizations which sometimes 
battle among themselves 
in damscus syria the dissident palestinian fatahuprising 
guerrilla group threatened sunday to assassinate palestinians who 
make direct contact with israeli leaders 
in a statement sent to the associated press fatahuprising 
particularly mentioned people considered by the enemy close to the 
palestine liberation organization it gave no names in the threat 
which apparently was designed to jeopardize arafats peace 
initiatives 
on friday arafat spokesman bassam abu sharif said several 
palestinians have been meeting with the israelis 
fatahuprising a syrianbacked group led by col saeed mousa 
broke away from arafats mainstream fatah movement in 1983

platt when officers stormed the house early sunday and an officer 
fired a single shot that struck hill in the face said police capt 
bruce erickson 
the girls 8yearold brother dominic was nearby when the 
shooting occurred police had detonated two flashbang grenades

leave 
they said they had to be allowed to leave if they didnt they

opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when 
it did

opened for soft drinks to be delivered 
the children seemed perfectly fine when we found them they 
cried and said they missed their mother cook said

thousands of people welcomed 
the return of the swallows to mission san juan capistrano but they 
were a little late the birds arrived in february 
tourists came from as far away as new york city to witness the 
traditional st josephs day arrival 
there may have been few swallows but 94yearold paul arbiso 
began his annual rite of ringing the mission courtyard bells on 
schedule on sunday which also marked the 50th anniversary of leon 
renes 1939 song when the swallows come back to capistrano 
for the air fare that i paid from new york i wanted swarms 
said colleen dunnholzworth 21 of new york city a rutgers 
university student spending spring break in southern california 
television camera crews eager for the proper dramatic effect 
resorted to throwing pebbles at the mission walls to get the already 
nesting birds to take flight 
although bird watchers say the swallows now roost throughout the 
sprawling orange county community tourists swarmed to the mission 
area and to nearby gift shops 
this year the first of the birds reached southern california in 
february said sandy wohlgemuth of the audubon society los angeles 
first accounts of the swallows coming from south america to san 
juan capistrano date to 1776 the year father junipero serra founded 
the picturesque mission as part of spains effort to colonize the 
new world 
mission museum director nick magalousis said the birds numbers 
at the mission have dwindled in recent years as they choose new 
sites to roost 
the main place thats most obvious is the mission viejo mall 
he said referring to a nearby shopping center theres hundreds 
of nests over there

yolondas first lesson about guns was almost her 
last 
it happened two years ago while she was taking a nap the 
thirdgrader said 
i felt something very very hard under the mattress she 
said i picked up the mattress and i saw a big old gun and it 
almost went off 
in the dade county public schools children are no strangers to 
guns thirtyeight students died of gunshot wounds in the first 11 
months of 1988 
the public school system has gotten into the business of gun 
education launching a say no to guns program modeled after the 
just say no to drugs campaign 
its just another no said bill harris safety and driver 
education supervisor with the dade county public schools 
superintendent joseph fernandez issued a memo alerting staff that 
gun safety would be a priority last dec 9 was proclaimed gun 
safety awareness day 
principals in all the countys schools delivered messages on 
firearm safety to kick off the program which was supported by 
posters 
at yolondas elementary school in miamis overtown notorious as 
the scene of civil disturbances high crime rates have given the 
neighborhood an atmosphere reminiscent of frontier days in the last 
century 
its very scary sometimes first grade teacher sandra banky 
said some of the parents come in and theyre actually carrying 
guns 
one of her students a 6yearold has been instructed in how to 
use a gun by a guardian who told the teacher if theyre left 
alone they have to know how to protect themselves 
harris said the typical gun casualty is a 10 to 12yearold 
male playing with a gun with a friend at one of their houses 
when the county decided to address the issue of gun safety 
school board members wanted to investigate existing programs they 
checked with other school systems and learned there were none 
the national rifle association offered its program which 
features a coloring book and a poster the poster instructs children 
not to touch a gun if they find one instead it tells them to leave 
the area and tell an adult 
but the art work shows a gun lying on a table some of the 
senior staff believed the message was subliminal telling children 
its ok to have guns left out harris said 
the gun lobby is concerned that the dade county program teaches 
children to fear guns 
some of it may instill fear among children harris said we 
dont have any problem with that 
we want to teach them to have respect for guns so much that 
they dont touch them

west german authorities showed british 
experts a bomb disguised as a radiocassette player five weeks 
before a similar device blew up pan am flight 103 and killed 270 
people an official said today 
the statement by interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier 
came amid criticism that british authorities knew such a bombing was 
possible but failed to warn airlines prior to the dec 21 disaster 
british authorities acknowledged sunday that a warning about such 
a disguised bomb was not mailed to airlines until after the tragedy 
also today west german authorities denied a report by londons 
sunday express that said a libyan terrorism mastermind known as 
the professor was believed to have plotted the tragedy 
bachmeier said british authorities attended a briefing by the 
west german federal crime bureau on nov 15 at which an explosive 
device hidden in a radiocassette player was demonstrated 
the radiocassette player contained a plastic explosive and a 
timing device that authorities have said are the same as those used 
in the bomb that destroyed the boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland 
the bomb shown to british authorities had been seized by west 
german police during an oct 26 raid on a hideout of the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command in the city of 
neuss 
they were in possession of all the information bachmeier 
said adding that the british security experts took photographs and 
made detailed notes on the disguised bomb 
both bachmeier and alexander prechtel a spokesman for the west 
german federal prosecutors office denied that authorities had 
identified the perpetrator 
the sunday express quoting unidentified west german detectives 
said authorities believe the bombing was plotted by a libyan 
nicknamed the professor by international security agencies 
the weekly said lebanese student khalid jaafar 20 of dearborn 
mich probably unwittingly carried the bomb on board hidden in a 
radiocassette player which the libyan had given him he was killed 
in the crash 
earlier news reports in the united states and london have quoted 
unidentified sources as saying jaafar may have carried the bomb when 
he boarded flight 103 in frankfurt west germany the fbi has 
questioned his father nazir who has denied those reports 
the flight originated in frankfurt then changed planes in london 
for a flight to new york 
the sunday express said the libyan whom it did not name flew 
to bonn from greece on dec 13 and met an iranian diplomat who let 
him work from the iranian embassy 
it said he stayed in germany at least until jan 6 he was seen 
three weeks ago driving a car with german license plates in lisbon 
portugal the report said 
the report said the professor trained as a member of an elite 
squad in the libyan army in the 1960s and called him a master of 
electronics explosives and forgery 
the sunday express said the libyan trained recruits for a 
libyabacked group headed by abu nidal who has been blamed for 
attacks on the rome and vienna airports in 1985 and other terrorist 
incidents 
the paper said the fbi has confirmed the man was being hunted in 
connection with the bombing 
in washington fbi spokesman steve gladis on sunday declined to 
comment on the report 
meanwhile british transport secretary paul channon was under 
pressure to explain or resign over his departments handling of 
warnings received before the bombing 
unless he comes to the house of commons at the earliest 
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail the 
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the atlantic will 
become irresistible said paddy ashdown leader of the social and 
liberal democratic party 
channon said sunday he told parliament as much as it is in my 
power to tell government ministers should not go around 
revealing things that might be against the national interest he 
told the british broadcasting corp 
the transport department confirmed last week it prepared a 
warning dated dec 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in 
a radiocassette player but did not mail it until after christmas 
a department spokesman said the warning was not sent until the 
new year because the accompanying photos had to be prepared the 
spokesman who demanded anonymity did not give the exact date of 
the mailing 
pan am has said it received the letter jan 17

a small circulation soviet magazine has printed an 
essay alexander solzhenitsyn wrote shortly before he was forced into 
exile in which he appeals to his countrymen to cast off 
officiallysanctioned lies 
the magazine also carried a commentary crediting the nobel 
laureate for helping prepare the way for president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms 
the publication represents another step in the gradual 
rehabilitation of an author whose major works remain banned in his 
homeland 
however the magazine did not publish solzhenitsyns most 
trenchent criticisms of soviet politics including his charge that 
repression has been a key element of kremlin policy since the days 
of vladimir i lenin 
moreover the essay was printed in a magazine destined in part 
for foreign markets selling 50000 copies abroad in russian 
english french spanish and german and with only a 100000copy 
circulation at home 
the 2page essay live not by lies was published in the 
february bulletin of the officially sanctioned soviet peace 
committees monthly twentieth century and peace 
it was written shortly before solzhenitsyn was arrested and 
expelled from the soviet union for his writings 
in the essay which was circulated at the time in thousands of 
illegal selfpublished copies solzhenitsyn called on his countrymen 
to display courage and resist pressure from the countrys rulers 
an honest man wrote solzhenitsyn does not raise his hand to 
vote for a proposal that he does not sincerely sympathize with does 
not vote either openly or in secret for a person he believes is 
unworthy or doubtful 
that sort of language considered antisoviet and seditious under 
president leonid i brezhnevs rule in the 1970s is now fully in 
line with gorbachevs calls for greater openness civic 
responsibility and democracy 
author igor vinogradov in the commentary appended to 
solzhenitsyns essay called the arrest and banishment of the 1970 
nobel prize winner a shameful act and lauded the writers high 
spiritual and civic courage 
without such brave people who spoke out against abuses of the 
soviet rulers of their time gorbachevs drive for perestroika 
social and economic reforms may never have come about vinogradov 
said 
those changes which started in our country three years ago 
could they be possible if in our society in all its strata 
contempt and loathing had not ripened among nearly everyone for 
those who personified the ruling evil and violence and for their 
miserable servants flooding the country with lies and 
demagoguery he wrote 
in an interview published today by the new york times 
solzhenitsyns wife natalia who often speaks for him said she was 
disappointed that the essay was published in such a 
smallcirculation journal because the piece was written as a broad 
national appeal 
given that this was meant as an address to the people this is 
not the place it should be published mrs solzhenitsyn was quoted 
as saying in a telephone interview from her home in cavendish vt 
vadim a medvedev the communist partys ideology chief said 
late last year he favored a continued ban on publishing works by 
solzhenitsyn because they would undermine soviet society 
i am against the publication of a number of works by 
solzhenitsyn and in the first place such works as lenin in zurich 
and the gulag archipelago the politburo member told a nov 29 
news conference 
to publish solzhenitsyns works would mean to in effect 
undermine the foundations on which todays life rests medvedev 
said 
his remarks indicated there are still limits on the amount of 
openness allowed under gorbachevs reforms 
solzhenitsyns one day in the life of ivan denisovich a 
chronicle of life in soviet labor camps under dictator josef v 
stalin was published in 1962 during the thaw allowed by nikita s 
khrushchev following stalins death 
some soviet writers artists and activists have clamored for the 
publication of solzhenitsyns works and his return to the soviet 
union in october the filmmakers union asked for a review of his 
1974 expulsion

the farm chemical alar has for four years been 
a symbol of industrial arrogance and regulatory footdragging to 
followers of the consumer movement 
but despite activists efforts its a safe bet most americans 
knew little or nothing about alar which is used to grow crisper 
more colorful apples and which has been linked to cancer in animal 
tests 
thats changed dramatically in the last two weeks 
the alarapple debate quickly gained publicpolicy star status 
through a 60 minutes television report the involvement of 
actress meryl streep and surprise moves by educators in new york and 
los angeles to yank apples from school lunchrooms 
despite reassurances from the government and health establishment 
that alar isnt all that unsafe signs of alarm have mounted 
by the end of last week the heads of the environmental 
protection agency and the food and drug administration both felt 
compelled to defend the nations apple supply they were joined by 
surgeon general c everett koop who released a statement saturday 
saying i wish to send a message to mothers across the country 
its ok mom apples are good for your kids 
apple growers in washington state blamed the controversy for a 
drop of nearly 10 percent in shipments of apples out of state in two 
weeks 
grocers and apple processing companies across the country 
reiterated policies against accepting apples sprayed with alar 
meanwhile the manufacturer of the chemical uniroyal chemical co 
of middlebury conn has repeatedly cited research showing alar in 
the concentrations found in apples doesnt pose a cancer threat 
the alar debate has been around with varying degrees of fervor 
since august 1985 when the epa considered but rejected a ban on the 
chemical used to control ripening and improve quality consistency 
and shelf life of apples 
in early february the epa finally did propose a phaseout of use 
of the chemical which would take it off the market starting 
probably next year but the epa said the threat of alar was not so 
severe that the ban had to start right away 
consumer groups including ralph naders public citizens health 
research group and the national resources defense council have 
campaigned for an immediate ban instead 
the periodic consumer campaigns have prompted many big 
supermarket chains and apple processors across the country to quit 
accepting alartreated apples as a result use of the chemical fell 
to an estimated 5 percent to 10 percent of the crop from a high 
around 50 percent many growers hoped controversy was behind them 
but on feb 26 the dormant controversy erupted anew 
the cbs television show 60 minutes reported a study by the 
natural resources group suggesting children because of low body 
weight and proportionately high consumption of apples had a 
heightened risk of cancer from alar 
then miss streep appeared on tv talk shows and gave interviews 
about her fears for her three childrens health 
the resulting blast of publicity prompted officials in the 
nations two biggest school districts new york and los angeles to 
temporarily pull apples and apple products from their cafeterias 
reports of the apple bans quickly spread 
in our democratic process an angry mob will be listened to no 
matter what the facts are said mark helmke a washington dc 
consultant with the robinson lake lerer and montgomery public 
relations firm 
thats whats happened in this case this story has struck a 
nerve helmke said 
studies show alar a trade name for the chemical daminozide 
could be linked to cancer in laboratory animals a breakdown product 
of alar called udmh also was shown to cause cancer when give to test 
animals in large amounts 
the american academy of pediatrics adopted a position paper march 
11 calling for an end to alar use but said parents shouldnt worry 
about farm chemicals applied in legal amounts

premier li peng opened the annual session of 
chinas legislature today by calling on chinese to work harder and 
make more financial sacrifices to collectively overcome worsening 
economic woes 
both government and people should be mentally prepared for a 
few years of austerity li told more than 2000 delegates at the 
great hall of the people in central beijing 
he urged officials to give up their vested interests in favor 
of the interests of the whole 
if we set a good example and explain clearly to the people the 
need for tightening our belts they will surely understand and 
support it he said 
the only exceptions li made to the tightmoney policy were 
agriculture and education li said the education budget would be 
increased and more loans would be made to farmers 
sitting behind li on the rostrum were other government and 
communist party leaders senior leader deng xiaoping 84 was 
absent but there was no official explanation deng attended last 
years opening session 
the chair normally filled by deng next to communist party chief 
zhao ziyang was filled by president yang shangkun next to yang sat 
li and next to him sat vice premier wang zheng two chairs were 
empty 
the tone of lis speech contrasted with last years when he 
called for bold new efforts to move the economy away from rigid 
central planning that long stifled growth since then however 
inflation has climbed to a postwar record annual rate of 36 
percent and overheated demand has caused shortages hoarding and 
several bank runs 
li blamed the economic problems on a tendency to be too 
impatient for quick results 
more often than not we tended to ignore the fact that china has 
a huge population is relatively short of resources and has an 
unevenly developed economy li said in a criticism of policies 
that he helped shape 
we did not pay sufficient attention to taking comprehensive 
and coordinated measures and failed to tighten control and 
supervision at the right moment he said we were too 
optimistic 
li was interrupted by applause when he reaffirmed chinas claim 
to sovereignty over tibet and denounced foreign support of tibetan 
separatism as outrageous interference in chinas internal 
affairs 
he also reiterated chinas position that it was justified in 
imposing martial law in tibet on march 8 after three days of 
antichinese violence in which at least 12 people died tibetan 
activists claim the region was independent before the communist 
takeover in 1950 
li did not mention letters sent to the congress by more than 100 
intellectuals appealing for an amnesty for political prisoners or 
the growing public clamor for greater freedom of speech 
most of lis speech was devoted to economic problems and 
austerity measures including strengthening control over price 
increases loans and new construction 
however he said the state would increase its grain purchase 
price by 18 percent beginning april 1 in an effort to end a 
fouryear slump in production banks will increase agricultural 
loans he said 
agriculture stands out as the weakest link in the national 
economy at present he said 
li also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget 
to 10 billion 
this figure is the best the government can do under the present 
tight budget although it still falls far short of actual needs 
he said he said alternate sources of funding would have to be found

republican political activists and business 
people from across the country contributed 105000 to an unusual 
limited partnership that then paid to promote a book coauthored by 
rep newt gingrich according to a published report today 
gingrich rga has been a chief accuser of house speaker jim 
wright in an ethics investigation focusing on issues including a 
book deal for the speaker gingrich also is a candidate in this 
weeks republican race to become house minority whip 
the washington post reported today that gingrich and his 
coauthors of a 1984 book set up the limited partnership that raised 
money for a promotion budget 
the post said gingrich asked the newspaper if he could delay his 
responses to its queries because a story that described his book 
deal as equally as weird as jim wrights would be to his 
disadvantage before the vote for minority whip the no 2 
republican leadership post in the house 
wright has been accused of using a congressional aide to edit his 
book and of using bulk sales of the volume to interest groups as a 
way to make money while skirting limits on outside income 
gingrich had acknowledged last summer even as he raised 
questions about wrights ethics that he once had a congressional 
aide work on window of opportunity which he coauthored with 
his wife marianne and david drake but gingrich said his aide did 
much less work than wrights staffer did on the respective volumes 
house democrats last year also attacked gingrich for a 1977 deal 
in which he allegedly was paid 13000 for a book he never produced 
questioned on friday about the limited partnership gingrich told 
the post that it was set up with the idea that a large promotion 
budget could force a bestseller i was real naive publishers 
normally pay promotion costs 
the 21 investors each put up 5000 and were to split half of the 
publishers profits however the publisher lost money and the 
investors thus were able to take a tax writeoff the paper said 
mrs gingrich told the paper she had a share of the partnership 
and was paid almost 10000 by it for her work as general partner 
the congressman said the partnership was his idea it spent 
70000 for promotion while most of the rest of the money went for 
expenses including the payment to mrs gingrich 
the book sold about 12000 hardcover copies and another 17000 in 
paperback 
gingrich is running against rep edward r madigan rill for 
the minority whip post vacated by former rep dick cheney rwyo 
who was sworn in friday as secretary of defense

journalists were harassed by 
gunfire from an army helicopter as they rushed a fatally wounded 
dutch television cameraman to the hospital after a firefight the 
reporters said 
it seemed as if soldiers in the helicopter were playing a 
game by firing ahead of and behind the journalists car said 
producer peter elenbaas who was among those trying to save his 
coworker cornel lagrouw 
the military said it regretted the deaths of lagrouw and of two 
salvadoran journalists killed in separate incidents while covering 
the presidential vote it said a soldier was arrested in one of the 
slayings 
the deaths brought to 15 the number of foreign and salvadoran 
journalists killed covering the nineyear civil war 
lagrouw 30 of the dutch television church network ikon was 
shot sunday during a clash between army troops and leftist 
guerrillas in san francisco javier a town about 70 miles east of 
san salvador 
he was standing next to guerrillas when he was struck in the 
chest by a bullet fired from an army position as troops moved in to 
take back the town said journalists who were with him 
he was pale but still alive said photographer bill gentile 
of newsweek who with arturo robles of jb photos and freelance 
newsman scott wallace pulled lagrouw out of the area and into a car 
to rush him to a hospital 
i was cradling him he was dying in my arms gentile said 
were not sure when cornel died on the ground or in the car 
two cars rushing lagrouw to the hospital in usulutan came under 
repeated fire from a helicopter gentile and robles said 
elenbaas told a news conference the moment we were out of the 
village the helicopter started pursuing us its probable they were 
playing a game with us if they had wanted to hit the car they 
probably could have hit it 
robles who was in a jeep ahead of the car carrying lagrouw 
said we had signs and we had four white flags 
under established protocol generally respected by both army and 
guerrillas reporters and photographers in el salvador travel in 
vehicles marked press or tv with white flags affixed to car 
doors 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek today called lagrouws 
death an extremely regrettable incident however he told 
reporters in belgium that it was an apparent accident and his 
government was not considering diplomatic steps against el salvador 
the dead salvadoran journalists were identified as roberto navas 
30 a photographer who worked for the reuters news agency and 
mauricio pineda 26 of channel 12 television in el salvador 
luis galdamez another reuters photographer was with navas on a 
motorcycle when the two were fired on by soldiers at a checkpoint 
saturday night on the outskirts of san salvador 
galdamez who was wounded told doctors at the rosales hospital 
before emergency surgery that he and navas were shot without warning 
pineda was with a mobile tv unit traveling to the coastal city of 
la union 115 miles from the capital when a soldier shot at the 
pickup truck according to station spokesman william figueroa 
the van was identified as a television vehicle and carried a 
white flag figueroa said it passed through a checkpoint early 
sunday to get to a regional airport and deliver film 
on the way back as it passed the checkpoint in daylight a 
soldier fired three shots from behind the vehicle killing pineda 
responding to the three killings the salvadoran correspondents 
association said in a statement in these three incidents we note 
with alarm a tendency on the part of the armed forces that appears 
aimed at intimidating and frightening the press corps in order to 
make their work more difficult 
col emilio ponce head of the joint chiefs of staff said the 
armed forces genuinely laments the deaths and promised to 
investigate the slayings and said the corporal who shot pineda was 
under arrest 
though they happened in a brief lapse this kind of incident is 
isolated it does not represent any policy or desire on the part of 
the armed forces to intimidate journalists or keep them from doing 
their job ponce said 
defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova said navas and 
galdamez did not heed orders to stop at checkpoints he offered 
condolences and most sincere apologies to their families 
four dutch tv journalists were killed on march 17 1982 in the 
northern province of chalatenango the government said they were 
slain during a gunbattle between rebels and army troops but the 
dutch government said it had evidence security forces were 
responsible

ten people criminally convicted for their 
participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a philadelphia 
abortion clinic lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that the 
defendants wrongly were barred from asserting medical justification 
as a defense for their crimes 
the appeal also urged that the philadelphia case be used to 
reverse the high courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
the justices already have under study an abortionregulation 
dispute from missouri in which they are being asked to reverse or 
limit the 16yearold ruling in a case called roe vs wade 
in the philadelphia case the 10 were convicted of defiant 
trespass and acquitted of all other charges stemming from an aug 
10 1985 antiabortion demonstration at the northeast womens 
center 
a state appeals court said the 10 pushed their way into the 
clinic and occupied several rooms once inside they damaged two 
aspirator machines and other medical instruments threw equipment 
out of a thirdfloor window and placed prolife stickers on the 
doors walls and ceilings the state court said 
after refusing to leave the 10 protesters were carried away by 
police officers 
each drew a sentence of one day to three months in jail

may 2 and the pennsylvania supreme court refused to hear their 
appeal last oct 20

their clients are among thousands of lawabiding citizens now 
engaging in heightened demonstrations or rescues at abortion 
clinics throughout the united states

her conduct would otherwise be criminal except for the defense of 
justification sought to be interposed in this case

a floridabased company wanting to require all 
its employees to attend weekly christian devotional services lost a 
supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment left intact rulings that the 
requirement violated the rights of an atheist who worked at the 
companys plant in eloy ariz 
lawyers for the company argued that its owners constitutionally 
protected religious freedoms were violated 
unless employers may operate their businesses in 
accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs the private 
workplace will increasingly become void of religion the appeal 
contended 
jo jake and helen townley control and manage the townley 
manufacturing co based in candler fla 
the couple are bornagain christians who said they promised god 
their miningequipment manufacturing company would be a christian 
faithoperated business 
the company founded in florida in 1963 since has opened other 
plants including one in eloy ariz 
employees at townley plants for years were required to attend 
weekly devotional services 
louis pelvas identified in court documents as an atheist began 
working as a machinist at the townley plant in eloy in 1979 
mandatory attendance at devotional services was not required there 
until 1984 
pelvas attended several and then asked to be excused because he 
was an atheist his supervisor told pelvas that he had to attend but 
that he could sleep read a newspaper or otherwise engage himself 
durng the services 
pelvas continued to attend the services which usually lasted 30 
to 45 minutes during the work day but in october 1984 he filed a 
religiousdiscrimination complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission pelvas left the company two months later 
saying he was offered a transfer that amounted to a firing 
the commission in 1986 ruled that townley violated a part of the 
civil rights act of 1964 barring onthejob religious discrimination 
a federal trial judge in arizona barred townley in may 1987 from 
continuing mandatory devotional services at the eloy plant 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges 
injunction last oct 20 
the appeals court noted that the federal law imposes a duty on 
employers to accommodate an employees religious practices unless 
doing so would cause undue hardship 
the appeals court said townley had failed to prove any undue 
hardship in pelvas case and rejected the companys argument that 
it is a religious corporation congress intended to exempt from 
the law 
the eeoc does not seek to enjoin the services altogether 
rather it only objects to their mandatory nature the appeals 
court said 
the bush administration urged the court to rule against townley 
and its owners 
any minor burden on the townleys religious practices is 
justified in this case government lawyers said 
the case is townley manufacturing co vs eeoc 88988

the supreme court today overruled south 
african president pw bothas order to halt the murder trial of six 
soldiers charged in the stabbing death of a black activist 
it marks the second time in four months that namibias highest 
court has overturned a decision by botha to grant immunity to 
soldiers accused of murder in namibia also known as southwest 
africa 
a threejudge panel said the soldiers of namibias south 
africanled army will have to stand trial for the nov 30 1986 
killing of immanuel shifidi 
those accused are four white officers two colonels a 
commandant and a lieutenant and two black enlisted men a corporal 
and a private 
shifidi 56 was stabbed fatally at a rally outside windhoek 
staged by the legal political wing of the southwest african 
peoples organization 
shifidi was a founding member of the organization which has 
fought a 23year bush war for independence from south african 
administration the organizations military wing is outlawed 
namibias attorney general has said the soldiers arranged for 54 
black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes and disrupt the rally in 
katutura a black township outside windhoek the capital 
the six pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and public 
violence but before the trial could begin botha last march invoked 
a section of south africas defense act that empowers him to grant 
immunity to any soldier for any action committed in good faith 
in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any 
operational area 
harmut ruppel a lawyer representing the shifidi family has said 
there is no evidence shifidi was a preselected target for 
assassination he said it appears the soldiers sought to discredit 
the guerrilla organization and intimidate its supporters by 
provoking violence at its rally 
the supreme court ruled bothas order was invalid but did not 
disclose its reasons 
on dec 15 it ruled against botha in a similar case arguing the 
president did not present important evidence botha had granted 
immunity to four soldiers accused of beating to death a black man in 
northern namibia 
south africa has agreed to begin implementing independence in 
namibia on april 1 leading to elections in november 
in other developments 
south african and namibian officials set up checkpoints monday 
to monitor crossborder movements previously no identity documents 
were required when traveling between south africa and namibia 
namibias south africanled army sunday demobilized a battalion 
made up mostly of troops from the bushman tribe known for its 
extraordinary tracking skills the bushmen part of 201 battalion

the supreme court today agreed to decide a 
narrow but potentially significant point of environmental law that 
may affect the effectiveness of enforcement by private citizens 
the justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit 
against a tillamook county ore landfill by the couple who own an 
adjacent dairy farm 
a federal appeals court threw out the 1982 suit because the farm 
couple failed to notify everyone they were required to under the 
environmental law they used to sue the county 
olaf and mary hallstrom live on a dairy farm near the landfill 
their 1982 suit alleged that contaminated liquid called leachate 
discharged from the landfill caused or contributed to bacterial and 
chemical pollution of the surface and ground water on their farm 
they contended that the county was violating the resource 
conservation and recovery act one of at least a dozen federal 
environmental laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for 
enforcement 
the hallstroms notified the county of their intent to sue well 
before the 60day period required by the federal law but they did 
not as required by the law give the same notification to the 
federal environmental protection agency or the oregon department of 
environmental quality 
a federal trial judge treated the failure to comply with the 
notification requirements as a procedural flaw remedied by merely 
delaying the suit for 60 days 
the judge ruled in 1985 that the county had violated the resource 
conservation and recovery act and ordered the county to remedy the 
violation within two years 
the judge refused to award the hallstroms 95000 in attorney 
fees and legal costs the couple appealed and the county filed a 
crossappeal 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1987 that the 
hallstroms lawsuit should have been dismissed because of their 
failure to notify the epa and the state agency 
the appeals court said the failure represented a jurisdictional 
flaw not a procedural one other federal appeals courts have 
reached the opposite conclusion 
the bush administration urged the justices to use the hallstroms 
appeal to resolve the conflicting appellate court rulings 
the different approaches can cause significantly different 
results government lawyers said 
they noted that the resource conservation and recovery act allows 
private enforcement lawsuits only if a defendant is allegedly 
violating the law at that time 
if a plaintiffs action is dismissed for lack of proper notice 
and the defendant promptly comes into compliance with the rcra the 
plaintiff may not file his action again the government lawyers 
said by contrast if the plaintiffs case were stayed the 
same defendant would remain liable for civil penalties and possibly 
attorneys fees 
the government said the 9th circuit court ruling was correct 
the case is hallstrom vs tillamook county 8842

the supreme court today turned away a 
stillpending bigmoney antitrust dispute over the sale of raw milk 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of 
dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives 
the case is nearly 18 years old dating back to a 1971 lawsuit 
filed by one of the dairy cooperatives who ended up an unsuccessful 
defendant in a countersuit 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in 1982 ruled against 
midamerica dairymen of springfield mo associated milk producers 
inc of san antonio texas and the central milk producers 
cooperative based in chicago 
the appeals court said they had engaged in a broad illegal 
conspiracy to eliminate competitive sellers of grade a raw milk in 
the midwest the appeals court ruled that the conspiracy hurt the 
national farmers organization inc a nationwide farm bargaining 
organization 
the 8th circuit courts 1982 ruling instructed us district 
judge john w oliver in kansas city mo to determine what monetary 
damages nfo should collect 
in ensuing proceedings before judge oliver nfo advanced 
alternative damage measurement theories it claimed tripled damages 
of 554 million under one theory and tripled damages of 222 
million under the other 
the trial judge refused to award any damages 
ruling in the case a second time last july 6 the 8th circuit 
court reaffirmed its holding that nfo incurred substantial 
damages as a result of illegal acts 
the appeals court again sent the case back to oliver with more 
specific directions with respect to the computation of damages 
the appeals court also said the trial judge should determine 
and award appropriate attorneys fees and costs to nfo 
it said oliver was right in rejecting the theory under which nfo 
said it was entitled to 554 million but it said the theory under 
which nfo claimed 222 million in damages is a proper basis for a 
substantial damage award 
the cases are central milk producers cooperative vs national 
farmers organization 881247 and associated milk producers vs 
national farmers organization 881248

the supreme court today again refused to let 
states and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal 
copyright laws 
the justices without comment refused to revive allegations that 
ucla a california staterun university illegally copied a 
companys computer programs and instruction manuals 
the justices on feb 21 turned away a similar appeal by a 
photographer who accused a state university in virginia of 
unauthorized use of his photographs 
in the case acted on today bv engineerings appeal was supported 
by numerous members of the artistic entertainment and literary 
community 
nine major motion picture studios urged the court to hear bv 
engineerings appeal to broaden protection against what they said is 
widespread copyright infringement 
the movie producers said for example that prisons in kansas 
west virginia idaho utah delaware north carolina and rhode 
island are refusing to pay for films shown to inmates 
bv engineering sued ucla in 1986 accusing the university of 
illegally copying seven computer programs and the accompanying user 
manuals 
the suit was thrown out by a federal judge and the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled last october that states and state 
agencies are immune from copyrightinfringement suits 
the appeals court said states are protected by the constitutions 
11th amendment which shields them from a variety of lawsuits 
the appeals court citing previous supreme court rulings said 
the federal copyright act of 1976 does not explicitly remove or 
abrogate the 11th amendment protection 
we are constrained by the supreme courts mandate that we find 
an abrogation of 11th amendment immunity only when congress has 
included in the statute unequivocal and specific language indicating 
an intent to subject states to suit in federal court the 9th 
circuit court said 
we recognize that our holding will allow states to violate the 
federal copyright laws with virtual impunity the appeals court 
continued it is for congress however to remedy this problem 
bv engineering said it was left without a remedy since federal 
copyright law bars the company from suing ucla in state court in 
california 
the case is bv engineering vs ucla 881099

an irs employee who under a cloak of 
anonymity accused the agency of not telling people who neglect to 
subtract withholding when figuring their taxes went public on 
network television today and was promised protection by sen albert 
gore jr 
if they try any kind of reprisal they better watch out gore 
dtenn said of internal revenue service officials 
the irs employee linda johnson a return examiner in the 
agencys service center in memphis appeared with gore on nbcs 
today show she had planned to appear in silhouette and with her 
voice disguised but dropped those precautions because i found out 
that its probabaly known out there who has actually reported 
it she said 
ms johnson originally told her story during a private meeting 
with gore she repeated it in an interview with the associated press 
last week but insisted that she not be identifed at the time 
because of fear of retaliation 
she is involved in the irss program to detect taxpayers who fail 
to report some or all their taxable income 
about 15 months after tax returns are filed computers match 
returns with form 1099s w2s and other sourceofincome reports and 
if some income does not show up on a return examiners such as ms 
johnson decide whether the taxpayer should be sent a letter 
demanding an explanation 
in 1987 while checking 1985 returns ms johnson said she and 
colleagues found numerous returns on which filers had failed to 
subtract withheld taxes from taxes owed that meant the taxpayers 
were overpaying 
when she went to supervisors she said they told her irs policy 
required taxpayers to find their own mistakes after protests she 
added her superiors checked with irs headquarters in washington and 
were told to abide by the policy 
it was stealing from the taxpayers ms johnson said 
she said the disputed policy was changed last year to allow irs 
employees to notify taxpayers when they fail to subtract taxes that 
have been withheld from wages or periodic pension payments but the 
old policy still stands for taxpayers who neglect to subtract taxes 
withheld from lumpsum pension payments 
the irs has steadfastly refused to comment directly on ms 
johnsons assertions saying it is reviewing its employee manual and 
policies 
however in an appearance before the house ways and means 
oversight subcommittee last week acting irs commissioner michael 
murphy said it is possible that taxpayers did not get the refund 
they were entitled to 
even after changes were made last december murphy said i 
still am not completely satisfied with that program

the supreme court today refused to bar oklahoma 
prosecutors who seek incriminating evidence from forcing the 
surgical removal of a bullet from a murder suspects arm 
the court without comment turned down harold allan andrews 
arguments that removing the bullet would violate his constitutional 
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures 
the oklahoma court of criminal appeals by a 21 vote last oct 
27 ruled that the surgery could be peformed against andrews will 
the operation has not yet taken place 
andrews is charged with firstdegree murder in the march 3 1988 
shooting death of hatten lee ledford in rural mcclain county 
before he died ledford told someone he thought he had wounded 
the man who shot him whom he identified as john d miser 
andrews was found suffering from a gunshot wound about 750 feet 
from ledfords home 
a state judge approved county prosecutors request to compel 
surgical removal of the bullet lodged in andrews upper arm 
the state appeals court in upholding that ruling noted a 
doctors testimony for prosecutors that removal of the bullet would 
not be lifethreatening and would require only a local anesthetic 
the extent of the surgical intrusion upon the defendants 
protective interests privacy personal dignity and body 
integrity is not impermissibly significant the state appeals 
court ruled 
in the appeal acted on today andrews argued that the oklahoma 
courts decision conflicts with what the justices ruled in a 
virginia case four years ago 
in the 1985 decision the high court refused to let virginia law 
enforcement officials force the surgical removal of a bullet from a 
criminal suspects chest 
a compelled surgical intrusion into an individuals body for 
evidence implicates expectations of privacy and security of such 
magnitude that the intrusion may be unreasonable even if likely to 
produce evidence of a crime the court said in the 1985 case 
the justices in that decision drew a distinction between the 
surgical removal of a bullet and the taking over a suspects 
protest of a blood sample to establish intoxication 
the court allowed such takings of blood samples in a 1966 ruling 
the oklahoma court distinguishing andrews case from the 1985 
decision said the surgery required in the virginia case was riskier 
the case is andrews vs love 881296

a newspaper photographer convicted for pursuing 
a police chase and photographing a suspects arrest in troy mich 
three years ago lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment left intact mark robert hoffmans 
conviction on charges of obstructing police work 
hoffman also convicted of reckless driving in connection with 
the may 6 1986 incident was sentenced to five days in jail and 
fined 400 
his appeal did not challenge the recklessdriving conviction 
but the appeal attacked a troy city ordinance that states no one 
shall obstruct resist hinder or oppose any police officers 
duties 
hoffmans lawyers said the ordinance when invoked against him 
violated freepress rights they also argued that the ordinance 
should be struck down because it places unfettered enforcement 
discretion in the hands of the police 
hoffman then working as an intern photographer for the detroit 
news was driving along interstate 75 when he heard on his radio 
that a nearby police car was pursuing a car that had rammed it 
hoffman pulled onto the highway shoulder and waited until he saw 
a state police car chasing another car he then followed driving up 
to 80 miles an hour to stay right behind the state troopers car 
when the suspects car came to a stop the state trooper stopped 
his patrol car right behind it jumped out and drew his gun 
troy police also had guns drawn and pointed at the suspect 
hoffman photographed the tense scene from what his lawyers said 
was about 10 feet away but lawyers for the city told the justices 
that hoffman was as close at 18 inches to the suspect and that he 
refused to get out of the way when ordered to do so by police 
hoffman no longer lives in michigan his lawyer said but still 
works as a newspaper photographer 
he has not yet completed the 5day sentence or paid the 400 
fine 
the case is hoffman vs troy 881212

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
workers at a california nuclear power plant who are challenging 
their employers random drug tests 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that threw out 
at least temporarily a lawsuit attacking the tests 
the justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in 
three other cases one involving a private employer and two 
concerning federal workers or federal regulations 
the case acted on today stems from tests initiated by southern 
california edison co at its san onofre nuclear plant 
the tests modified in december 1986 require randomly selected 
workers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis the 
workers are told the day before they are tested 
the plan was challenged by local 246 of the utility workers union 
of america 
the union said the tests violate the collective bargaining 
agreement between the workers and the utility and also violate 
provisions of the california constitution protecting privacy and 
freedom from unreasonable searches and seizure 
the unions lawsuit was filed in state court and transferred to a 
federal court at the request of southern california edison 
a federal judge in 1987 temporarily blocked the tests pending 
resolution of a grievance filed by the union 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
injunction and also ruled that the lawsuit was preempted by federal 
labor law 
the appeals court said the federal labor management relations act 
governing workeremployer disputes bars the nuclear plant workers 
from filing a suit now claiming their rights guaranteed by the 
california constitution were violated 
drug testing does not implicate the sort of nonnegotiable 
statelaw rights that would allow the suit to be decided in court 
before it is determined whether the tests violate the workers 
collective bargaining agreement the appeals court said 
the appeals court said the next step for the union is to submit 
the case to arbitration to decide whether the contract was violated 
because the utility unilaterally adopted the tests 
the appeals court did not rule out the possibility that local 246 
could return to the courts if it loses in arbitration 
the union said it should be entitled now to a ruling on whether 
the california constitution protects workers against random drug 
tests 
the case is utility workers union vs southern california edison

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by a federal judge in pittsburgh who issued orders in a 
bankruptcy case after he disqualified himself from presiding over 
the matter 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that set aside 
the judges orders 
us district judge paul a simmons announced in his courtroom on 
jan 29 1988 that he was disqualifying himself from a case 
involving the jeannette corp glass company because of the 
appearance of a conflict of interest 
simmons disclosed that his daughter worked for mellon bank a 
creditor of jeannette corp 
the judge then continued to preside over a hearing that lasted 
more than six hours 
on march 16 1988 simmons granted a request to convert 
jeannettes bankruptcy petition from one aimed at reorganizing the 
corporation to one dissolving it 
simmons also sharply criticized two lawyers involved in the case 
robert a cindrich and douglas a campbell he accused them of 
trying to rip off this estate in millions of dollars 
the lawyers said simmons announcement of his orders in the case 
were a press conference to which reporters had been summoned by 
the judges secretary the attorneys also said there was no basis to 
simmons accusations against them 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
simmons should have stepped aside immediately after announcing there 
was a potential conflict of interest 
once a judge has disqualified himself he or she may enter no 
further orders in the case the appeals court said in ordering the 
bankruptcy matter assigned to a different judge 
the appeals court also urged simmons in light of the animosity 
that appears to have arisen between himself and the two lawyers 
to consider never again presiding over any matter involving their 
firms 
the appeals court also said the way simmons announced his orders 
at the march 16 proceeding appeared to highly inappropriate 
the case is simmons vs moody 881174

two women active in fighting pornography today 
lost supreme court attempts to revive libel lawsuits against hustler 
magazine and its publisher larry flynt 
the court without comment let stand rulings that 1985 articles 
villifying each woman in pornographic terms are constitutionally 
protected expressions of opinion 
peggy ault who founded an antipornography group in milwaukie 
ore and dorchen leidholdt a new yorker who helped found women 
against pornography were the targets of a column published each 
month in hustler 
the column which frequently elicits libel suits from its 
subjects singles out people who oppose the sexually explicit 
magazines views carrying an epithet as its title the column 
usually engages in personal attacks as well as criticizing its 
targets views 
ms ault was the columns target in the magazines april 1985 
issue ms leidholdt in the june 1985 edition 
some of the gentler terms used to describe ms ault included 
fanatic crackpot threatened by sex and deluded 
busybody 
ms leidholdts lawsuit charged that the june 1985 column falsely 
described her as sexually repressed a person who hates men and 
herself and suffers from bizarre paranoia vengeful 
hysteria and demented thinking 
ms ault sued in federal court in oregon ms leidholdt in 
federal court in wyoming 
both suits were dismissed by a trial judge before they reached a 
jury and the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
dismissals last october 
in ms aults case the appeals court said we think it clear 
that there is a heated and spirited debate on pornography of which 
this article is a part in which epithets fiery rhetoric and 
hyperbole are expected 
the appeals court added it is unfortunate that the legal 
category of opinion must be used to describe a statement that is no 
more than a vicious slur but base and malignant speech is not 
necessarily actionable libel 
in the appeals acted on today lawyers for both women argued that 
the 9th circuit court rulings unduly expanded the concept of legally 
protected expressions of opinion 
what public debate is furthered by this type of assault on 
personal dignity one appeal asked elevation of such conduct to 
the pedestal of protected speech should not be tolerated 
but lawyers for flynt and his magazine in urging that the 
appeals be rejected argued that the constitution protects even 
vituperative pejorative or pernicious opinion 
the cases are leidholdt vs lfp inc 881214 and ault v 
hustler magazine inc 881215

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
libel lawsuit against the los angeles times by a naval commander 
courtmartialed in 1984 after his ship ran aground in hawaii 
the justices citing a lack of jurisdiction left intact 
california court decisions dismissing cmdr willard g bud 
chrismans suit that alleged seven times articles ruined his naval 
career 
the state courts cited chrismans failure to request a correction 
or retraction a requirement under state libel law and the legal 
protection given to fair and accurate reports of governmental 
proceedings 
the first suedover article reported allegations that chrisman 
had been intoxicated when his ship the san diegobased uss 
thomaston ran aground in port allen kauai on jan 24 1984 
the second article reported that the navy had decided to 
courtmartial chrisman on charges stemming from the grounding 
the last five articles reported on each day of the courtmartial 
concluding with a report that chrisman had been convicted of 
negligently hazarding his ship but acquitted of charges that he was 
drunk at the time 
a state trial judge refused to dismiss chrismans suit against 
the times but an appeals court later ordered that the case be 
thrown out 
the california supreme court refused to hear chrismans appeal 
last july 28 
in the appeal acted on today chrisman argued that the california 
retraction law should not have been invoked in his case because the 
times articles had been published with actual malice 
the appeal also contended that the articles reporting his 
courtmartial were neither true or fair because the testimony was 
incorrectly or falsely summarized 
chrisman said the state court rulings unconstitutionally extend 
the scope of the neutral reportage privilege and literary license 
doctrine so as to deprive him of the right to protect his 
reputation from defamatory statements 
lawyers for the newspaper urged the justices to reject chrismans 
appeal 
the case is chrisman vs times mirror co 88844

the supreme court today refused to let idaho 
officials tax the income of railway workers who live elsewhere but 
pass through the state as crew members on nonstop freight trains 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that such a tax 
would violate the constitution and be unfair to the workers 
the idaho supreme court ruled last may that burlington northern 
railroad crews working on trains traveling between spokane wash 
and whitefish or missoula mont may not be forced to pay the tax 
the trains cross idahos panhandle without making any scheduled 
stops in the state 
idaho officials in 1983 ordered the railway workers to pay taxes 
on income received from 1978 through 1982 the state sought to 
impose the tax on a portion of the workers income state officials 
said was earned while in idaho 
the state supreme court said idaho is not the source of this 
income since there is no contribution by idaho to the production of 
this income it would be unfair to allow the state to impose a tax 
on the income of the train crews earned while they are merely 
passing through idaho 
the state court said the tax violates the constitution by 
interfering with interstate commerce and by denying the workers due 
process protection 
the state court added that the workers wages while passing 
through idaho are not attributable to any economic activity within 
idaho and idaho markets and commerce do not affect their income in 
any degree 
the state court relied largely on us supreme court rulings 
holding that the test for the constitutionality of a state tax 
affecting outofstate residents is whether the state has given 
anything for which it can ask return 
the state court said while the state has given something of value 
to burlington northern it has not given anything to the train 
crews for which it can ask return 
in the appeal acted on today idaho officials said the state 
court ruling sets a dangerous and disruptive precedent and 
conflicts with decisions by other courts giving states sweeping 
power to tax nonresidents who work within those states 
taxpayers in other jurisdictions are now lining up to challenge 
taxation of nonresidents based on idahos decision the states 
appeal said 
the case is idaho tax commission vs blangers 881266

republicans in the house of representatives are 
like a losing team in search of a new manager do they want someone 
wholl stress fundamentals and building for the future or a 
scrapper who promises an allout assault with the weapons at hand 
thats the issue as house republicans try to decide on a 
successor to dick cheney the new secretary of defense who vacated 
the job of minority whip the gops second highest post in the 
chamber 
rep edward madigan 53 of illinois is the solid steady 
lawmaker who makes few headlines but has climbed to stature within 
the hallways of capitol hill 
rep newt gingrich 45 of georgia is the ideological 
rabblerouser who brashly describes himself as a national leader 
who serves in the house 
the clear choice between two styles and directions is being 
presented this week to a republican group that is itself torn the 
gops usual posture of working with the ruling democrats to win what 
it can has lost favor with some republicans who want to lash out in 
frustration after more than three decades as the minority party 
the decision could color the proceedings of the house for some 
time to come the winner of the race will become the heir apparent 
to house minority leader bob michel rill who is expected to 
retire in the next few years 
it is a kind of a watershed said rep bill frenzel rminn 
outside of washington gingrich is by far the better known of the 
two candidates the leader of the conservative opportunity society 
cant keep away from the television cameras and like his nemesis 
house speaker jim wright dtexas has a penchant for hyperbole that 
leaps into print 
i bring to the office of whip a national network national 
issues national resources personal ties to republican chairman 
lee atwater personal ties to the bush presidential campaign 
personal ties to the executive branch he said touting his 
qualifications at a news conference last friday 
madigan is what the party wants if it would prefer to remain in 
the minority gingrich said i am deeply committed to ending the 
36year democratic monopoly of power in the house he said 
it was gingrich who made the official complaint that launched the 
current house ethics committee probe of the democratic speaker jim 
wright of texas a move that many on both sides of the aisle at 
first considered too daring too much rocking the boat 
part of that complaint involved an favorable deal under which the 
speaker published and sold a compilation of personal reflections a 
published report today showed that gingrich also had an unusual book 
arrangement with political allies forming a limited partnership to 
pay for promoting a book gingrich cowrote 
gingrich argues he is cut out for being the minority whip a job 
of head counting head bashing and organization he cites his fight 
in the house administration committee to get republicans more staff 
slots in the house 
he says his election as whip also would mean integrating 
the process of legislation and the process of national opinion 
thats a totally different race than the normal whip race 
it would be a handy cliche to say that madigan bristles at 
gingrichs suggestion that hes the choice of the status quo 
republican minority but he doesnt he calls no press conferences 
in an interview he calmly tries to refute gingrichs portrayal of 
the race and makes clear that hes talking only about a different 
kind of hardball 
there are no content republicans all republicans want to be in 
the majority he said and we are an oddson bet to do that in 
1992 without respect to who is elected whip because of 
reapportionment and party strength he said 
madigan the current deputy whip and a senior member of the 
agriculture and energy and commerce committees has been conducting 
a lowkey campaign based on my demeanor and experience and 
legislative accomplishments 
i love this institution i want it to be occupied by a 
republican majority i do not want it destroyed the last is a 
clear reference to gingrichs willingness to employ radical tactics 
but madigan denies it im not saying anything about mr gingrich 
his campaign or anything that he says he said 
to gingrich the democratic majority is a corrupt dictatorship 
hes even compared his feelings toward speaker wright to his 
feelings toward convicted murderers 
madigan is more sympathetic 
the democrats are as frustrated as the republicans and are no 
more effective as a majority than we are as a minority he said 
i think they relieve their frustrations by crapping on republicans 
and think that thats some kind of accomplishment when its no 
accomplishment at all 
i just feel that somebody needs to challenge them to a higher 
standard of behavior and productivity he said 
the republican election is expected to take place at a party 
conference next wednesday 
there are just 174 qualified voters and its hard to predict 
wholl come out on top 
and theres a potential wild card rep henry hyde of illinois 
a popular conservative who declined to run but has left himself open 
for a draft movement announced by rep jerry solomon rny 
on friday both gingrich and madigan said they were about to go 
over the top in commitments predictions close watchers of the race 
took with a grain of salt 
with those numbers were now a majority party quipped a top 
house gop aide

president bush said today that hes pleased by 
management reforms at the united nations and said he believes it is 
on the right track toward securing greater influence in world 
affairs 
speaking at a swearingin ceremony for thomas pickering the new 
us ambassador to the united nations bush said i take the united 
nations very seriously and i am pleased with the changes that have 
been taking place there 
in the first days of his presidency bush invited un secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar to a private white house dinner in a 
meeting that bush aides said was aimed at conveying the new 
administrations support for the world body 
the reagan administration late last year agreed to begin repaying 
to the united nations more than 474 million in payments that the 
united states had withheld in protest over what it said were 
inadequate management controls and insufficient attention on 
peacemaking initiatives 
in his remarks today bush who served as un ambassador during 
the nixon administration said he wants pickering to put the 
spotlight on the human rights situation in communist cuba as he 
takes up his post 
the united nations is on the right track toward reform and is 
not a more effective organization the president said he praised 
pickering 67 as a skilled diplomat a veteran of highpriority 
tough assignments 
bush also said that there was a time when a lot of us got a 
little pessimistic about the uns peacekeeping role but said 
that the bodys performance has improved vastly in recent times 
including its mediating role in afghanistan the iraniraq war and 
the angolanamibia conflict 
pickering after taking the oath of office from secretary of 
state james a baker iii joked that he and james lilly the new 
ambassador to china might find themselves working under close 
scrutiny by bush who he said knows more about our jobs than we 
do bush headed the us liaison office in beijing in 197475 
i will be on my toes in new york said pickering who 
previously held ambassadorial posts in israel jordan nigeria and 
el salvador

more than 3500 public pay telephones located 
on federal government property controlled by the general services 
administration will remain under license to local bell companies and 
the american telephone and telegraph co the gsa said today 
richard g austin acting gsa administrator said the decision 
was preliminary until gsa conducts a further analysis about 
licensing a pay phone company 
he said the gsas decision would not prevent the agency from 
selecting a longdistance carrier other than atampt or pay phone 
companies other than the bell companies at a future date 
gsas decision was in response to an order in october by us 
district judge harold greene under which the owners of premises 
where bell pay phones are located must decide by april 1 which 
longdistance carriers to use if they dont make a choice they 
will be assigned to a longdistance carrier by lottery 
greenes order was part of his supervision of the breakup of atampt 
in 1984 atampt now has a monopoly on longdistance calls from bell 
pay telephones and greene said other companies should get a chance 
to compete for the 2 billion in longdistance revenues generated 
each year from the nations 15 million pay phones 
the calls in question are those made by dialing 0 plus the 
longdistance number and either using an operator to charge the call 
to a home phone to make it a collect call or use a credit card 
longdistance carriers pay commissions to the businesses where 
the pay phones are located gsa said it received 399156 in such 
commissions in 1988 it said it expects to receive about 663000 
for the federal treasury this year because of increases in the 
commission rate

the supreme court today agreed to use a new 
jersey case to decide whether federal courts may make it easier to 
broaden age discrimination lawsuits against employers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by hoffmannla roche inc 
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 
1200 employees at new jersey plants 
the company dismissed the employees on feb 4 1985 a group of 
older workers who called the day black monday for many veteran 
hoffmannla roche workers said a disproportionately high number of 
those laid off was over age 40 
the group filed a federal lawsuit charging the company with 
violating the federal age discrimination in employment act 
the groups leaders then sought to contact all fired hoffmannla 
roche employees over 40 eligible to join the socalled classaction 
lawsuit 
some 400 employees agreed to join but the leaders of the court 
battle against the company said they believed there may be 200 
additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly 
victimized by age discrimination 
the leaders sought to contact the potentially missing workers by 
directmail and notices posted at hoffmannla roche plants 
us district judge harold a ackerman authorized the employees 
group once the missing workers are found to provide them with an 
explanation of the suit and a form that would allow them to join the 
suit 
hoffmannla roche officials appealed the ruling arguing that 
ackerman exceeded his authority but the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals upheld the judges decision 
there is no legal impediment to courtauthorized notice in an 
appropriate case where those who have filed a classaction suit 
are seeking other potential plaintiffs the appeals court said we 
assume that the district courts will exercise caution that notices 
approved by the courts will not give the erroneous impression that 
maintenance of the action has a judicial imprimatur of approval 
an increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big 
advantage because it spreads out the court costs in seeking workers 
to join the suit the leaders of the court fight asked for but did 
not require a 200 contribution to help defray the costs 
in appealing to the supreme court hoffmanla roche officials 
noted that federal appeals courts elsewhere have disagreed with the 
3rd circuit court decision the officials urged the high court to 
clear up the confusion 
the case is hoffmannla roche vs sperling 881203

the planes wreckage was concentrated in a small area and parts 
were buried deep in the ground indicating that it fell at a steep 
angle said robert benzen national transportation safety board 
investigator 
benzen said the crew reported an emergency and a problem with a 
cargo door shortly before the crash 
that is a focus of the investigation but were still keeping 
our eyes wide open benzen told the fort worth startelegram 
structural engineers are looking at parts of that door now and at 
this juncture its not telling us what we want it needs more 
study 
the jets flight data recorder was recovered saturday the 
cockpit voice recorder was sent to washington for analysis sunday 
the flight data recorder was battered and very damaged but we 
are very sure the magnetic tape inside was intact benzen said 
the cockpit voice recorder was very burned with components melted 
out of it but the magnetic recording tape is shielded against such 
heat we hope and hopefully it will tell us something 
the plane built in 1968 was owned by oregonbased evergreen 
international aviation and was en route from carswell to tinker air 
force base near midwest city okla on a routine cargo flight for

prime minister yitzhak shamir today opened a 
conference of 1100 visiting jews by saying israel needs peace but 
rejected talks with the plo or creation of a palestinian state 
as shamirs conference on solidarity with israel began an aide 
to finance minister shimon peres broke ranks with shamir and called 
for talks with the plo 
deputy finance minister yossi beilin who spoke on israel radio 
urged the leftofcenter labor party led by peres to open talks with 
the plo even if shamir and his rightwing likud bloc disagree i 
think its time to say dear friends the emperor is naked beilin 
said 
in the occupied territories israeli soldiers shot and wounded a 
20yearold palestinian protester in the thigh arab reports said 
about 330000 palestinians in the gaza strip were kept indoors by 
curfew restrictions imposed as merchants launched a threeday 
general strike to protest seven palestinian fatalities in clashes 
with the israelis over the weekend 
four of the deaths were sunday bringing the death toll in the 
15month palestinian uprising to 403 arabs seventeen israelis have 
also died including six soldiers 
israeli news reports said some leading jewish personalities 
declined to attend shamirs conference attended by jews from 30 
countries 
the haaretz daily listed among the absentees hollywood stars 
including kirk douglas and barbara streisand who reportedly gave 
nonpolitical reasons for staying away 
critics complain the threeday conference aims to boost support 
for shamirs hardline policies before his us visit next month 
however jewish leaders at the conference were cautious about 
endorsing israels policies we are not here to support specific 
peace proposals seymour reich president of the usbased 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations 
told reporters 
in his keynote speech shamir restated positions he is expected 
to bring to washington offering the palestinians a maximum degree 
of selfrule that is consistent with our security 
we fully recognize that the status quo is not in our interest 
because it means absence of peace and peace is our paramount 
goal shamir said in the speech closed to the press but later 
distributed to reporters 
shamir reiterated his reasons for refusing to talk to the 
palestine liberation organization or withdraw from the west bank and 
gaza strip which it seized from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
we are opposed to negotiations with the plo because it will 
inevitably lead to a demand for a palestinian state west of the 
jordan river he said 
he referred to the strategic dangers and vulnerability of our 
eastern borders 
the israeli leader also voiced veiled criticism of jewish leaders 
abroad who have met with plo leaders 
peres suggested today he is willing to talk to plo supporters in 
the occupied territories if they prove they are nonviolent asked 
his conditions for negotiating with the plo he said we want to 
negotiate with people who reside in the territories we will not 
censor their minds 
the us government agreed to talk directly with the plo after 
leader yasser arafat renounced terrorism in december

an offshore oil drilling platform burned early 
today after explosions on it and an adjacent rig injured at least 10 
crewmen and left seven missing the coast guard said 
a helicopter and more than a dozen boats searched the gulf of 
mexico for the missing men about 30 people were rescued from the 
burning rigs and surrounding water according to the coast guard and 
the atlantic richfield co 
flames on the second rig connected to the burning one by a 
catwalk were extinguished a few hours after they started sunday 
evening said coast guard chief mike robling 
the rigs were in an area just off the southeast tip of louisiana 
and near the mouth of the mississippi river about 70 miles from new 
orleans known as the arco south pass block 60 said company 
spokesman earl sims in dallas 
five of the missing men work for atlantic richfield which 
operated the rigs and two are contractors said sims 
coast guard petty officer bob morehead said an oil slick two 
miles long and about 100 yards wide extended from the rigs he said 
at least four oil crew boats were reportedly attempting to 
extinguish the blaze 
sims said determining exactly how many people were on the rigs at 
the time of the fires would be difficult because there are about 10 
rigs within several miles of each other in the area and workers 
sometimes move from rig to rig during an assignment 
it would be like trying to tell how many people are in a 
building at one time he said 
the cause of the explosions has not been determined but will be 
investigated by the marine safety office the coast guard said 
i just dont know of any specific operations at the time of the 
explosion that would have caused this sims said the damage is 
extensive 
ten of the injured were taken to west jefferson hospital in 
marrero a new orleans suburb eight of them were burned including 
two who were in critical condition and the other two suffered 
multiple injuries said spokeswoman beth dutcher 
coast guard petty officer bob morehead said 13 injuries were 
confirmed but he did not know where the other three men were taken 
for treatment sims said he knew of only 10 injured crewmen the 
ones at west jefferson hospital 
cmdr gerry donohoe pilot of one of the helicopters which took 
some of the injured to the hospital said when he left the area 
flames were still shooting high from one rig 
it looked like the entire rig would be down to the waterline by 
tomorrow he said sunday 
one crewboat was shooting water trying to put the fire out 
but it probably wont help much he said it couldnt get very 
close 
he said he landed on one of the other oil platforms in the 
immediate area where crewboats were taking the injured and others 
including some who apparently jumped into the water

sporting a shamrock on his lapel vladimir 
orekhovsky chuckled when he told of singing an irish lullaby during 
the annual st patricks day parade down main street 
he and 10 other members of a soviet inspection team in utah under 
provisions of a 1987 nuclear arms reduction treaty were invited to 
the parades reviewing stand in one of many appearances sponsored by 
utahans eager to foster international goodwill 
i sang danny boy he said in an interview at the apartment 
complex that is home to the 26member contingent maintaining a 
roundtheclock vigil at hercules aerospaces missile manufacturing 
plant 
orekhovsky was public relations officer for the team whose 
members serve sixweek tours before rotating back to the soviet 
union 
but until he left for home monday his movements like those of 
all the soviet inspectors who will be in utah for the next 13 years 
were under the strict supervision of the us onsite inspection 
agency 
its a control many utah peace activists want relaxed 
since the original team arrived last july the soviets have been 
warmly received in classrooms and at sporting and cultural events 
team commander nickolay shabalin speaking through an 
interpreter recalled the special satisfaction of seeing ballet 
west a regional professional ballet company perform anna 
karenina and a local exhibit of paintings by soviet children 
but shabalin emphasized the soviets principal duty is to ensure 
that no pershing ii missile motors banned under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty leave hercules the company 
stopped producing the motors in 1986 and none are stockpiled here 
one should not get the wrong impression that the soviet 
inspectors came here as tourists said orekhovsky the most 
important reason that we arrive here is the verification of the 
treaty 
eightman squads serve 24hour shifts at a checkpoint by an 
entrance to the hercules complex in western salt lake valley 
inspecting outgoing vehicles and patrolling a road surrounding the 
former pershing building they work one day then have two days off 
the work of monitoring is not very complicated but it is very 
responsible shabalin said 
under terms of the treaty the visitors may not travel without an 
american escort or or go more than 31 miles from hercules the same 
conditions apply to us inspectors at a similar plant in the soviet 
city of votkinsk 
the inspectors have been tireless in accepting invitations to 
public forums they say they dont chafe under the rigid rules 
governing their excursions but the same cant be said for some of 
their hosts 
edwin firmage a university of utah law professor and 
antinuclear activist and rosemary holt president of women 
concerned about nuclear war are trying to persuade the inspection 
agency to allow the inspectors to accept dinner invitations at 
private homes 
both believe the agencys denial of private visits for security 
reasons is without merit especially since the soviets have 
appeared so often in public 
when the first group of soviets arrived some were permitted to 
attend barbecues at a couple of private homes before the policy was 
changed holt said 
we saw that not only as an opportunity lost for the citizens of 
utah but for the soviets to know us in a personal way she said 
theres a difference between sitting down with a cup of coffee as 
opposed to speeches a world of difference 
we must see each other fundamentally in our common humanness 
firmage said the overwhelming transcending reality is that we 
are human beings 
inspection agency spokeswoman mary wilson declined to discuss 
details but said security is paramount 
there are other considerations she said if you get to where 
youre accepting some but not others you get into a discrimination 
problem she said 
shabalin vice director of the national nuclear risk reduction 
center in moscow avoids any appearance of taking sides 
the solution of this question rests with the proper american 
authorities he said its positive or negative solution doesnt 
affect in any way the accomplishment of the mission we have

climate warming could mean higher crop 
yields in the northern states and canada but agricultural pests and 
diseases could well follow a columbia university researcher said 
monday 
cynthia rosenzweig told the association of american geographers 
that the effects of threatened global warming must be studied in 
combination not one at a time 
for example she said scientists have tended to look at such 
things as temperature and rainfall and how those affect crops 
instead she said an overall study must be done not only of how 
each change affects life but of how the changes interact 
rosenzweig spoke at a session on global change which focused on 
the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere many scientists say could 
have serious effects on mankind 
the greenhouse theory is that carbon dioxide and other gases 
released into the atmosphere by industrial and other processes will 
trap heat from the sun warming the planet in somewhat the same way 
that a greenhouse is warmed 
scientists speculate this could have an impact on crop growth and 
rainfall patterns and even could melt some of the polar ice caps and 
produce a disastrous rise in sea levels 
there is disagreement over whether such a warming has already 
begun most meteorologists contend that last years hot dry summer 
was part of normal weather variability and not a result of the 
greenhouse effect 
nonetheless scientists tend to agree that warming is likely in 
coming years although the amount depends on factors not fully 
understood 
rosenzweig reported that she has looked at two models of 
potential climate change and found that the likely result would be 
smaller crop yields in the southeast and midwest but increases in 
production in the northern states and parts of canada largely due 
to the longer growing season as the climate warms 
this warming led to increased need for irrigation in some areas 
she added and irrigation could become more costeffective as 
smaller crop yields drove up prices 
in addition to better crops in the northern areas however the 
warmth will also allow survival of crop pests during the winter in 
more northerly areas as well as the mosquitoes and other factors 
that can spread livestock diseases she said 
these findings illustrate the need to look at economic medical 
and other results of climate change she said 
william e easterling of the research firm resources for the 
future inc told the same meeting that his company has begun a 
study focusing on the gradual response to change 
global warming will come gradually and people will seek ways to 
adjust to it he said it is necessary to start thinking about the 
technology crop varieties and economic system that will exist 50 or 
75 years in the future said easterling in order to plan for 
climate change 
since the 1920s he said the growing of hard red winter wheat 
has expanded from a region focused on kansas and nebraska to areas 
extending all the way from canada to texas 
this happened because of improvements in the varieties of wheat 
available and in farming methods he said 
both easterling and rosenzweig stressed the need for increased 
research on drought and on crops that can resist heat 
rosenzweig however added that adjusting the type of crop grown 
helps cope with change in some areas but isnt effective in all 
regions 
at the same time she said climate change will be affecting the 
whole world not just the united states so farmers need to keep in 
mind the needs of other nations and the export demand for their 
products

president bush today called himself a proud 
member of the national rifle association but said a compromise must 
be struck on automated weapons because were in a very different 
time now 
the country needs to know that there is some answer to this i 
dont yet know what it is he told a group of women state 
legislators 
later white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told 
reporters clearly theres been some evolution of his bushs 
thinking on gun control 
fitzwater also voiced white house concerns over reports that nra 
officials had hinted at political repercussions to national drug 
control director william bennett if he cracks down too hard on gun 
sales 
this is not a time for threatening people but time to work 
together fitzwater said 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press last week that bennett had been receiving warnings from the 
rifle association through third parties hinting that nras campaign 
fundraising abilities might be used against him if he ever sought 
political office 
bennett said through a spokesman don hamilton that there have 
been a lot of phone calls a lot of pressure lets cool off at 
the time nra official wayne lapierre called the allegations 
absolutely ridiculous 
bush directed bennett to review the entire issue of 
semiautomatic weapons fitzwater said today that the administration 
would take no further action until that review is complete beyond 
last weeks banning of the import of semiautomatic weapons 
in his talk to women legislators bush said on the nra of 
which i am a member a proud member i believe we can find an 
accommodation between the legitimate interest of sportsmen and the 
interests of police chiefs whose men put their lives on the line 
every day 
were in very different time now i am convinced that 
reasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to the 
problem of these automated weapons bush said 
bushs comments came against a backdrop of disagreement among 
senior federal officials over how fast and far the government should 
go in urging gun manufacturers to follow the example of colt 
industries inc and stop nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic assault 
rifles 
the head of the drug enforcement administration john lawn on 
sunday urged an end to such sales but drug czar bennett and 
attorney general dick thornburgh advised caution 
i thought that was a very courageous action on the part of 
colt guns are dangerous law enforcement is suffering because of 
these guns lawn said on the cbstv program face the nation 
i am asking them to take this action on behalf of the 
officers who are in danger every single day because a police 
officer dies every 57 hours in this country he said 
colt announced that it was suspending sales of its ar15 
semiautomatic rifle starting last thursday the day after president 
bush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreignmade assault 
rifles 
bennett and thornburgh urged a broader approach to combating 
illegal narcotics and said there are limits on what the government 
can tell private manufacturers of semiautomatic weapons 
this is not a dictatorship bennett said on cbs we do not 
tell people how to do their business 
but in a separate appearance on the nbctv program meet the 
press bennett said i think we can make the case that we dont 
need a whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now 
bennett also said we have to get the person who is 
sometimes called the casual user one expert in this field has told 
me that 70 percent of the cocaine thats used in this country is 
used by the socalled recreational user the yuppie user 
that person bennett said needs to realize the kinds of 
things hes responsible for the murder and mayhem thats going on 
in washington the fact that we have babies now being born addicted 
to cocaine the murder of dea agents in other countries 
these people are accessories to all those things and they need 
to start paying a price for that if youre using cocaine and 
driving around in your bmw when you get stopped you lose your bmw 
there are ways we can make people pay the price and help them 
recognize what theyre doing to the nations children 
thornburgh cautioned against believing that gimmicks could 
stop drug abuse 
if we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is 
to ban a particular type of weapon were dead wrong thornburgh 
said on the abctv program this week with david brinkley 
addressing the issue of drug use in nations capital bennett 
said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district 
a high intensity drug trafficking area enabling him to assemble 
a government strike force to fight drug dealing in washington 
as of sunday 118 murders had been reported in washington in 
1989 a record rate and police say that nearly all are drugrelated 
the washington post quoting unidentified bennett aides said 
sunday that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders try 
to shut down the citys 90 openair drug markets and use abandoned 
military facilities as temporary prisons for drug offenders 
we are looking at whether we should do that or not bennett 
said

a federal judge today stopped the district of 
columbia from enforcing the citys new emergency curfew law for 
teenagers 
after a hearing on a suit brought by the american civil liberties 
union us district judge charles richey issued a 10day temporary 
restraining order blocking enforcement of the statute in issuing 
his ruling the judge said the law was too broad 
he noted that mayor marion barry jr has said alternative 
legislation will be proposed to narrow the law 
richey said he would extend the restraining order if barrys 
legislation does not differ from the emergency bill reviewed today 
barrys revised measure is expected to go to the city council on 
tuesday or next week 
the law went into effect last thursday but barry delayed 
enforcement of the measure until monday night to give police time to 
become familiar with its provisions and to inform the public 
aclu attorney arthur spitzer said the law would penalize youths 
and also could give them a permanent legal record 
city attorneys however argued that parents would be penalized 
but richey noted that the students names would be entered into a 
permanent police record which might affect their ability to get jobs 
the aclu filed suit on friday to declare the temporary 90day 
law unconstitutional 
the classaction suit was filed on behalf of the parents of five 
teenagers a 12yearold boy and three other individuals 
barry criticized the aclu suit last week saying the aclu 
lawyers dont sleep in these neighborhood where you cant sleep at 
night because gunshots killings are going on 
the curfew law requires persons under age 18 to be off the 
streets at 11 pm during the week and by midnight on weekends the 
curfew ends daily at 6 am

the late cia director william casey tried to 
discredit a congressional staffer who had met with an official of 
nicaraguas leftist government a former house member said today 
former rep michael barnes dmd gave the testimony at oliver 
norths irancontra trial while answering defense questions about 
victor johnson staff director of the foreign affairs subcommittee 
on western hemisphere affairs that barnes chaired 
johnson at the time was assisting barnes in pressing the reagan 
administration to respond to press reports that north was soliciting 
contributions and providing tactical advice to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
under crossexamination by north lawyer brendan sullivan barnes 
said casey requested a meeting in the fall of 1985 in which the cia 
director said the spy agency had intercepted a conversation of a 
nicaraguan official 
the other party in the conversation was johnson casey died in 
1987 
barnes said casey quoted johnson as telling the nicaraguan 
official that if nicaragua improved human rights and took other 
steps those actions would help members of congress who were trying 
to reject aid to the contras 
i found the allegations he made to be basically frivolous 
said barnes he didnt allege that members of my staff were 
passing classified information to the nicaraguan government 
i told him in my judgment based on what he told me that 
what johnson had done was perfectly appropriate said barnes 
earlier today barnes testified that thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane seemed very nervous about congressional 
inquries over norths activities 
barnes described how mcfarlane in a 1985 meeting offered to let 
him examine national security council documents pertaining to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels but that mcfarlane refused to let 
congressional staffers see them 
the meeting in mcfarlanes office occurred after he had denied in 
a sept 12 1985 letter to barnes that national security council 
staffers were engaged in fundraising assistance and offering 
tactical advice to the contras 
north now is accused of obstructing congress and making false 
statements in connection with that letter and two others written in 
1985 
were you aware that north collaborated with mr mcfarlane on 
writing that letter prosecutor michael bromwich asked no 
responded barnes 
the excongressman said that in a subsequent letter with 
mcfarlane and facetoface meeting he requested all documents 
relating to communications between the united states government and 
the contras 
i felt that mr mcfarlane was very concerned about our 
investigation very nervous about it barnes said he emphasized 
that i felt he was very nervous in the meeting 
barnes said he rejected mcfarlanes offer to examine the 
documents saying it was always necessary in such cases to have 
knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them 
i wasnt prepared to accept the restrictions that only he be 
permitted to look at the documents said barnes 
on crossexamination sullivan referred to a memo by 
congressional staffer johnson five days after the sept 12 written 
denial of contra assistance 
the memo said that if congress puts the executive branch in the 
position of nondisclosure on the contra issue that refusal 
embarrasses the administration and helps us 
sullivan sought to show that the contra issue had become highly 
politicized he brought out in questioning barnes that all members 
serving on a house task force that was dealing with the issue were 
opposed to starting up aid to the rebels 
during the period of barnes inquiries the boland amendment 
enacted by congress specified that no federal agency engaged in 
intelligence activities could spend money to assist the contras

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether taking a hallucinogenic drug as a religious practice can be 
made a crime 
the justices voted to review a ruling that oregon officials 
violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to 
two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies 
in their decision expected sometime next year the justices 
necessarily must resolve whether any state may criminally prosecute 
someone for the religious use of peyote 
in other matters the court 
cleared the way for the partial merger of detroits two daily 
newspapers 
agreed to let the bush administration through the solicitor 
generals office participate in the april 26 oral argument 
scheduled for an abortionregulation case from missouri 
state officials are asking the justices to use the case to 
reverse or limit the courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
let stand the criminal convictions of 10 people who participated 
in a 1985 protest demonstration at a philadelphia abortion clinic 
refused to revive libel lawsuits one in oregon and one in 
wyoming against hustler magazine and its publisher larry flynt by 
two women active in fighting pornography 
turned down the appeal of california death row inmate william 
george bonin the freeway killer of four teenage boys in orange 
county 
refused to bar oklahoma prosecutors who seek incriminating 
evidence from forcing the surgical removal of a bullet from a murder 
suspects arm 
left intact decisions thwarting a floridabased companys 
requirement that all its employees attend weekly christian 
devotional services lower courts said the mandatory services 
violated an atheists rights 
in the peyote case the oregon supreme court last year ruled that 
its states criminal law makes no exception for the religious use of 
peyote a cactus button containing the hallucinogen mescaline 
but the state court ruled that the federal constitutions first 
amendment which protects religious freedom bars state officials 
from denying unemployment compensation to two members of the native 
american church 
in effect the state court said oregon criminal law must make an 
exception for good faith religious use of peyote by adult members 
of the native american church 
the two men galen black and alfred smith had been fired from 
their douglas county ore jobs counseling people who suffer from 
drug or alcohol addiction 
there is no dispute that both men are members of the native 
american church and sincerely believe that peyote is part of the 
churchs religious practices 
lawyers for the two men said using small quantities of the drug 
in that church is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities 
of wine in christian religious ceremonies 
the case was before the nations highest court last year and the 
justices voted last april to send it back to the oregon supreme 
court 
the april decision held out the possibility that states in which 
peyote is outlawed may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired 
for using it during religious ceremonies 
but justice john paul stevens in writing for the court then 
noted that the federal government and some states exempt the 
religious use of peyote from criminal prosecution

americans are flushing too much of a precious 
resource down the toilet say two lawmakers who are pushing for 
strict waterflow standards on household plumbing fixtures 
manufacturers are fighting the congressional attempt to impose 
firstever federal efficiency standards on toilets shower heads and 
other fixtures 
the average american uses more than 18000 gallons of water a 
year in the home about 50 gallons a day of that 40 percent goes 
down the drain from toilets said rep chester g atkins dmass 
the amount that is used unnecessarily is staggering especially 
in light of the fact that new technology to improve performance of 
watersaving products is commercially available he said 
atkins and sen wyche fowler dga have drafted legislation 
that would mandate national water efficiency standards for household 
plumbing fixtures such as faucets washing machines dishwashers 
shower heads and toilets 
the largest savings would come from better toilets 
only one state massachusetts has imposed toilet efficiency 
standards 
amy vickers project manager at the massachusetts water resource 
authority estimates that the new 16 gallonsperflush state 
standard which took effect earlier this month will save the 
typical boston household 70 a year 
older toilets typically use 5 gallons of water per flush newer 
models 35 gallons 
massachusetts standard will save the state about 70 million 
gallons of water daily by early in the 21st century ms vickers 
projected 
on a national scale that would mean a savings of 2 billion to 3 
billion gallons of water a day from the most efficient toilets she 
said 
proponents of lowflow standards say they could eliminate the 
need for building expensive water supplies and watertreatment 
facilities especially in big cities such as boston and new york 
where officials already are worrying about balancing limited water 
supplies against everincreasing demand 
toilet manufacturers oppose the legislation saying it would 
create an unnecessary bureaucracy and amount to an improper 
intrusion by washington into an area that has been traditionally 
handled by local governments 
it puts the federal government for the first time directly into 
the process of writing building codes and standards and the federal 
government for the last 200 and someodd years has tried very hard 
to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local 
communities said richard church president of the plumbing 
manufacturers institute 
church said it would be dangerous to force manufacturers to 
bring that technology out before its completely tested 
especially for installing the more efficient water closets as 
the industry still calls toilets in older houses 
were quite concerned that in specific localities theres apt 
to be severe problems if 16 gallonsperflush toilets are the 
only ones available said church youre asking for problems 
water closets are flushed with gravity at 16 gallons were 
right on the edge of what gravity can actually do he said 
but proponents of the legislation scoff at the suggestion that 
the bills 1992 deadline for more efficient toilets would be 
difficult for the industry to meet 
this isnt like trying to go to the moon said ms vickers 
the two leading us toilet manufacturers american standard and 
kohler co are fighting the legislation 
although the toilet provision has drawn the most controversy the 
legislation is as an atkins aide rob henken says by no means 
just a toilet bill 
the proposal would set a 25 gallonsperminute standard for 
shower heads and kitchen faucets a 2 gallonsperminute standard 
for bathroom faucets and a 1 gallonperflush standard for urinals 
henken said 
those requirements would take effect in january 1991 a year 
before the standard for toilets he said 
the bill also would require the energy department within three 
years of enactment to set water efficiency standards for washing 
machines and dishwashers

realestate magnate donald trump said today he is 
no longer willing to pay 365 million for the eastern airlines 
shuttle citing the labor problems that have largely grounded the 
financially troubled air carrier 
he said he wants to cut the price by more than onethird there 
was no immedite response from texas air corp easterns 
houstonbased parent company 
in a letter to frank lorenzo head of easterns parent company 
texas air trump said the shuttle has become an entirely 
different business in that its market share and customer base may be 
lost for some time to come if not forever 
today the business is worth considerably less than the price 
negotiated last fall trump said 
asked in an interview today how much he wants to cut the price 
he said im looking for a reduction in excess of 125 million 
the new york billionaire financier announced last october that he 
would purchase the moneymaking operation for 365 million in cash 
and name it after himself 
however the strike by easterns machinists union members 
chiefly mechanics and baggage handlers and the unwillingness of 
most of the airlines pilots to cross their picket lines has forced 
eastern to file for bankruptcy 
only about 200 of the 3600 eastern pilots have been working 
since the strike by the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers began march 4 
eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily 
fights about one10th its normal level 
the airline which has begun advertising for new pilots has 
acknowledged there are no nearterm prospects for expanding its 
operations 
shuttle flights are among those still taking off the airline has 
been struggling to keep the shuttle between boston new york and 
washington in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives 
including promotional fares as low as 12 fares returned to normal 
saturday 
trump said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would 
like to close a deal before the shuttle operations become worse 
in his letter he asked lorenzo to call him later today to 
discuss the sale 
asked about the trump report eastern spokesman jim ashlock said 
we dont have any comment at all we know absolutely nothing about 
it here in houston texas air spokesman art kent did not 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment

pan american world airways is still failing to 
heed many antiterrorism measures an israeli security firm suggested 
to the carrier more than two years ago a congresswoman said today 
the security consultant concluded that pan am conducted 
insufficient checks of baggage did a poor job of questioning 
passengers boarding planes and was slow to react to warnings of 
possible terrorist activity rep cardiss collins dill said in a 
letter to the federal aviation administration 
she quoted passages from two reports kpi inc presented to pan am 
in september and november of 1986 
the firm had reviewed pan am security at nine airports including 
frankfurt and londons heathrow airport pan ams flight 103 on 
which a bomb exploded last dec 21 over scotland killing 270 
people originated in frankfurt and stopped at heathrow 
pan am is highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorist 
attack the september report said the fact that no major 
disaster has occurred to date is merely providential 
that report was written within days of a sept 6 1986 attack 
on a pan am plane in karachi pakistan in which 18 passengers and 
crew members were slain mrs collins said 
she quoted the kpi report as saying in conclusion there are 
no adequate safeguards under the presently operating security system 
that would prevent a passenger from boarding a plane with explosives 
on his person or in his baggage whether or not he is aware of the 
fact 
in her letter to acting faa administrator robert e whittington 
mrs collins chairwoman of the house government operations 
transportation subcommittee wrote based on its own 
investigation the subcommittee has determined that many of the gaps 
in pan ams security system that were identified in the 1986 kpi 
reports have not yet been corrected 
she added that pan am insists that the security breaches 
identified in the kip reports have been addressed 
louise kuzma a secretary at pan ams new york headquarters said 
spokesmen for the airline were at lunch and could not immediately 
comment on the letter

iran on monday said an iraqi proposal to 
exchange all prisoners of war is a propaganda ploy and insisted on 
the return of more than 700 iranians that tehran says were captured 
since an august truce 
on march 5 iraqi president saddam hussein proposed the exchange 
of all 100000 prisoners held by both sides outside the framework of 
the peace talks which have been deadlocked since they opened in 
geneva on aug 25 
in a letter to the international committee of the red cross 
released monday at un headquarters iran noted that it had 
informed the red cross that iraq seized over 700 iranians mostly 
soldiers in the first weeks after the truce in the iraniraq war 
began aug 20 
the eight years of fighting came to an end after both sides 
agreed to negotiations that use un resolution 598 as a blueprint 
for a permanent peace settlement among other things the resolution 
calls for withdrawal of occupying forces and prisoner exchanges 
tehran said the detention of the iranians violates the third 
geneva convention regulating the treatment of pows and it called on 
the red cross to pressure iraq to release them 
it is worth noting that during the first round of negotiations 
in geneva for the implementation of resolution 598 the foreign 
minister of iraq announced the said prisoners would be released 
soon irans letter said referring to the un security councils 
peace plan 
it is now clear that the iraqi foreign ministers promise was 
made only for propaganda purposes at the time which like all other 
iraqi statements of repatriation of prisoners of war are void of any 
humanitarian substance said the iranian letter 
the red cross has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 
19284 held by iraq but un officials and diplomats estimate the 
total number of pows is about 100000 
an agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners of war in 
november broke down over mutual recriminations of bad faith 
including the numbers of prisoners requesting asylum on both sides

the army said monday it will conduct a special 
onetime evaluation of every nightvision goggle in its inventory to 
ensure the devices are safe for use by aviators 
the service in a brief statement said the evaluation would 
involve about 12700 of the devices and would require at least two 
weeks and possibly more to complete 
the evaluation will include not only the two models of night 
vision goggles that are being used now but also two other models 
that were suspended from flight use a year ago when safety questions 
began arising 
critics have questioned whether the goggles function properly 
when used if there is no moon or in cloudy weather according to 
recent published reports 37 of 41 army helicopter crashes since 
1978 in which night goggles were used occurred when there was not 
enough moonlight for the devices to amplify 
the most recent incident in which the use of night vision goggles 
has been questioned occurred just a week ago on the night of march 
12 a ch3e helicopter assigned to the air force reserve crashed 
near tucson ariz while ferrying some soldiers to a training 
range fifteen servicemen died in the accident 
according to capt carlos roque a spokesman at the davismonthan 
air force base where the helicopter was based the crewmen on that 
chopper were wearing goggles that night but investigators have 
determined the goggles were not a factor in the accident roque said 
the evaluations will be conducted by experienced army pilots and 
will take about 20 minutes each said lt col greg rixon an army 
spokesman they can be performed on the ground in a specially 
lighted room 
rixon said the army inspections are aimed at eliminating from the 
stockpile any goggles that suffer from a distortion problem that was 
identified some time ago inside the lightamplifying tubes of each 
goggle there is a builtin twist to an optical fiber line that can 
produce distortion in the lens if not made properly he explained 
every goggle that can be used for flight is going to be 
evaluated rixon said if there are no problems the goggle is 
cleared for use if there is a problem it takes about 45 minutes to 
change the tube 
the spokesman said the cost of replacing the goggle tubes ranged 
from 1100 to 5000 depending upon the model

a vermont town showed a markedly reduced drunken 
driving rate after residents were taught to use an inexpensive 
gadget to estimate their bloodalcohol levels according to a study 
that experts called promising 
the towns rate of driving with hazardous bloodalcohol levels 
was only about half that of a similar community that gave no 
training the study found 
although the small study could provide only preliminary evidence 
that the program works the results look encouraging said coauthor 
john k worden of the university of vermont college of medicine 
he and colleagues from the university and state government 
present the work in this months issue of the american journal of 
public health 
experts said the results were promising but that some questions 
about effectiveness remain to be answered they also said such a 
program should be considered only in combination with other 
strategies to reduce drunken driving 
the study involved three vermont communities which worden 
declined to identify two with populations of about 5000 and the 
third approaching 12000 they were similar in terms of education 
level household income and the proportion of males among residents 
aged 16 to 29 
in one community an education program featured walletsized 
cards and small cardboard dials for estimating ones own 
bloodalcohol concentration according to body weight and the number 
of drinks consumed about 3000 dials were handed out in bars 
stores restaurants and filling stations 
customers were trained to use the dials at those outlets and in 
television announcements broadcast about 20 times a week worden 
stressed that training at the outlets was important because it 
ensured a lot of conversation about the program 
a second town was exposed only to the television announcements 
which mentioned a couple of local outlets for the dials no training 
was provided at those outlets 
the third town received no portion of the program 
six months after the program began police stopped all traffic on 
six weekend nights in the three communities bloodalcohol 
concentrations were measured in 333 drivers from the community that 
had no part of the program 405 from the town with only the 
television announcements and 154 from the community with the full 
program 
analysis found that 111 percent of drivers from the town with no 
intervention had concentrations of at least 005 percent the level 
at which the dial warned that driving becomes impaired 
in the televisiononly community 101 percent of drivers also 
reached that level but only 58 percent of drivers from the 
fullprogram community scored that high 
the legal driving limit of 01 percent blood alcohol was reached 
by 3 percent of drivers from the noprogram community and 47 
percent from the televisiononly community but only 06 percent 
from the fullprogram community 
philip graitcer of the federal centers for disease controls 
division of injury epidemiology and control cautioned that 
questions remain about how effective such a program would be over a 
longer period whether it would work in other settings and whether 
it would in fact reduce accidents 
still the relatively inexpensive program offers a strategy 
that may work he said 
james f mosher program director at the marin institute for the 
prevention of alcohol and other drug problems in san rafael calif 
said the program would be best used in combination with other 
efforts such as training bartenders and waiters to regulate 
drinking among patrons 
such a package of strategies could also include increasing the 
excise tax on alcoholic beverages and using local laws to decrease 
risk of drunken driving said alex wagenaar head of the injury 
analysis and prevention group at the university of michigan 
transportation research institute in ann arbor

dissidents said monday they will fight 
on to oust president roh taewoo who indefinitely postponed a 
promised national referendum on his performance 
hundreds of students threw dozens of firebombs into two police 
stations in the southern city of kwangj shouting punish roh 
taewoo according to the south korean news agency yonhap 
the attack destroyed a police motorcycle and caused other 
extensive damage yonhap said there were no immediate reports of 
injuries and arrests 
yonhap said the students also shouted slogans demanding an end to 
annual team sprit exercises involving 200000 south korean and 
us soldiers 
the attack came after police sneaked into chosun university in 
kwangju and removed wall posters denouncing the exercises yonhap 
said dissidents have accused the exercises of heightening tension 
on the divided korean peninsula and hampering unification with 
communist north korea 
roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since winning office 
in late 1987 but many south koreans distrust the government because 
of its ties to the authoritarian regime of former president chun 
doohwan 
south koreas main dissident alliance the united national 
democratic movement urged roh to stop fooling the people with 
the referendum issue and said the alliance will push for rohs 
resignation 
roh postponed the midterm referendum he had promised during the 
1987 election campaign accusing antigovernment forces of trying to 
use the vote to organize violent protests and topple the government 
the vote was expected to be scheduled for midapril 
violent leftist forces are trying to overthrow the 
government roh said in a nationally televised address monday 
leftist forces are trying to use the midterm appraisal as a 
foothold for overthrowing the free democratic system 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
roh was not legally required to call the vote 
his decision is outside the normal constitutional requirements 
in the sense that this is a referendum that he proposed himself we 
certainly want to see a democratic process followed but at this 
point we dont have any comment on the postponing of the 
referendum fitzwater said 
the dissident alliance charged roh wants to delay the referendum 
by recognizing his unpopularity some opposition and dissident 
forces have demanded roh stake his presidency on the referendum and 
step down if defeated 
it was not clear if roh was backing away from the referendum 
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the 
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new 
elections some government officials had expressed concern about 
rohs ability to win a referendum 
the government had said earlier that roh would not resign if he 
was defeated but some administration officials conceded a defeat 
would put pressure on roh to call elections 
the main opposition parties said they accepted rohs decision but 
would watch to ensure the government does not attempt to retreat on 
any other promises to bring in full democracy 
the party of peace and democracy of kim daejung welcomed the 
referendum delay the reunification democratic party of kim 
youngsam said it would accept only a temporary delay 
kim youngsam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting 
roh would lose kim daejung opposed a referendum apparently 
because kim youngsams party had overtaken his in opinion polls 
the kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in the 
december 1987 elections allowing roh to win with 36 percent of the 
vote roh promised during the election campaign to hold a referendum 
after his first year in office to give voters a chance to evaluate 
his performance

at first glance puerto rican mountain music 
break dancing and the house under the roller coaster at coney 
island dont have a lot in common 
but to steven zeitlin director of city lore all three pieces of 
the citys folk culture are worth preserving 
city lore documents and promotes ethnic traditions and 
neighborhood pastimes what zeitlin calls the artistic genius of 
the average person 
new york has always been regarded as the cultural capital 
because of the opera and the ballet and things like that he said 
we say its also the cultural capital because of the enormous 
diversity of the population 
artists showcased by city lore range from afghan immigrants 
making rugs to women from senegal braiding hair in traditional 
elaborate designs the afghans live in brooklyn the senegalese in 
harlem 
by presenting these art forms at our annual summer festival in 
central park in museums at concerts in the schools we give these 
people a reason to keep their art form going said zeitlin 
its not something they have to give up to become american 
other artists featured by city lore have included papa manteo a 
staten island puppeteer whose sicilian marionettes enact the legend 
of the ninthcentury roman emperor charlemagne and shenaz hooda 
who uses crushed henna leaves to paint lacelike designs on the hands 
of muslim brides if the dye left on the hands fades too quickly 
during the first weeks of marriage the husband is said to have 
forced his wife to wash too many dishes hooda brought the tradition 
from her native bombay 
city lore tries to preserve the best of pop culture before it 
gets repackaged by madison avenue and the media 
theres so much pressure in new york for things to be 
commercialized that something like rap music gets picked up 
immediately and becomes a national phenomenon said zeitlin 
neighborhood break dancers and rappers were featured at city lore 
events long before these genres became staples on the rock video 
channel mtv 
musicians with roots in puerto rico cuba and other latin 
countries are given a forum in city lores musica tradicional 
concert series held each summer 
city lore which started out 10 years ago has a 300000 annual 
budget funded by private and government grants students writers 
and artists use the groups archives folk artists come looking for 
a place to perform and for help with grant applications 
neighborhood storytellers are featured on city lores monthly radio 
show on a public station 
city lore also is concerned with preserving the citys past a 
project is under way to compile an oral history of the men who built 
the subway and the organization is mounting an effort to save what 
it calls endangered spaces sites like the oldfashioned 
merchant stalls in the essex street market and the house under the 
roller coaster at coney island 
immortalized in woody allens movie annie hall the house is 
in danger of being demolished city lore wants to save it although 
the woman who lives there the widow of the man who ran the roller 
coaster was just as happy to move out said zeitlin 
city lore is hoping the house can be preserved in a form that 
will please developers as well as coney islandlovers a restaurant

premier li peng opened the annual legislative 
session monday with a somber speech on chinas economic crisis that 
stressed centralized control and the need to halt political reforms 
chinas senior leader 84yearold deng xiaoping did not attend 
the session of the national peoples congress as he did last year a 
foreign affairs ministry official said only that deng asked for 
leave 
lis speech to the 2768 legislators in the cavernous great hall 
of the people marked the consolidation of a policy of economic and 
political retrenchment that began in september 
whereas congress last year called for democracy and bold attempts 
to free chinas economy from rigid central planning lis speech 
called for control 
experience has proved time and again that without the necessary 
centralization and unity without strict organization and 
discipline it would be absolutely impossible to readjust the 
economy and overcome difficulties he said 
li also appeared to level veiled but pointed criticism at 
communist party chief zhao ziyang who as premier in 1987 launched 
china on an ambitious reform program 
silent for most of the 130minute speech the delegates erupted 
in applause six times near its end when li turned from the troubled 
economy to issues at the heart of chinese nationalism tibet and 
foreign affairs 
any support for the independence of tibet li said in reference 
to recent bloody riots in lhasa constitutes an outrageous 
interference in chinas internal affairs and will absolutely not be 
tolerated 
he also warned the united states to refrain from interfering 
with chinas internal affairs lest the existing friendly 
relations between the two countries be impaired 
the us senate and state department have expressed concern over 
the violent suppression of lhasa riots in which at least 16 people 
were killed this month 
most of the speech however focused on chinas troubled domestic 
situation li read slowly in a low monotone pausing often to clear 
his throat 
china faces a record 36 percent inflation that has sparked panic 
buying and bank runs rising crime affects its cities and corruption 
sullies the halls of government 
much of the troubles have been blamed on inflation in 
septemberchina began a program to tackle price rises by slowing 
reforms designed to introduce elements of a market economy to the 
staterun system 
both government and people should be mentally prepared for a 
few years of austerity li warned 
price reform construction projects loans industrial growth and 
consumer demand all should be cut he said 
even some productive projects should be stopped or suspended 
and necessary construction projects follow an order of importance 
and urgency 
only education and agriculture would be spared li said 
to halt a fouryear slide in grain production the state will 
raise its grain purchase price by 18 percent on april 1 he said 
and banks will increase agricultural loans 
he also announced a 15 percent increase in the education budget 
to 10 billion 
both sectors are considered key to development and critics say 
they have been overlooked in recent budgets 
li appeared to blame party leader zhao for inflation the root 
of chinas trouble 
zhao backed a fullsteamahead approach to reforms when he was 
premier in 1987 while li was more cautious at one point zhao said 
the only criterion for whether reforms were successful was whether

we were too optimistic in our assessment of the economic 
situation in 1987 he said instead of taking effective measures 
we relaxed control over and readjusted the prices of more 
commodities only to intensify the panic of the masses over the price 
hikes and evoke a buying spree 
the premier ignored a growing public clamor among intellectuals 
for greater freedom of speech evidenced by a recent call for an 
amnesty for political prisoners 
instead he said all dialogue must take place under the 
leadership of the communist party 
li also said the economic troubles made it necessary to postpone 
temporarily political reforms that would give more decisionmaking 
power to businesses previously run by the state also overstaffed 
governments were to be cut back and a civil service system 
introduced 
the congress is meeting through april 4 
two important laws are expected to pass one will give citizens 
the right to sue the government the other outlines the powers of 
the congress which does little but routinely endorse policy 
directed by the communist party

a federal judge turning aside a plea for 
desperate measures against drugrelated violence in the nations 
capital on monday temporarily barred the city from enforcing a 
curfew aimed at keeping most teenagers away from openair drug 
markets late at night 
us district judge charles b richey in issuing a 10day 
temporary restraining order ruled that the overnight curfew law 
could unfairly penalize thousands of youths and result in 
permanent and irreparable injury to those detained unfairly 
under the antidrug trafficking statute 
his ruling came despite an argument by district officials that 
the citys record murder rate required immediate action 
these are desperate times and they require what may well be 
considered desperate measures argued robin alexandersmith 
assistant corporation counsel you see it on tv every night the 
criminal element has taken over the streets and is seducing the 
children 
the district has recorded 119 homicides this year up from 73 for 
the same period last year for all of 1988 there were 372 
homicides an alltime high 
the district of columbia council last week passed an emergency 
law banning teenagers under the age of 18 from gathering on city 
streets after 11 pm sunday through thursday and after midnight 
friday and saturday the curfew would have ended at 6 am each day 
it was designed to keep young people from buying or selling drugs on 
city street corners or openair drug markets 
enforcement was scheduled to begin monday night even though 
mayor marion barry jr and corporation counsel fred cooke 
acknowledged that the plan might violate constitutional guarantees 
of freedom of assembly and privacy rights 
to enact a law that raises serious constitutional questions 
when city officials know themselves it will not work gives me 
chills the judge said 
cooke also had said the bill might not slow the pace of 
drugrelated shootings since police statistics indicate that the 
average ages of murder victims and perpetrators in the nations 
capital are both over 30 
the american civil liberties union asked that the curfew be ruled 
unconstitutional claiming that it unfairly prevented thousands of 
city teens from attending church school or other legitimate 
functions late at night 
this curfew was a reaction to this problem not a solution 
said arthur spitzer legal director for the aclus national capital 
chapter it will hardly deter a teenager bent on committing a 
crime it will deter lawabiding teenagers from going about their 
business 
richey said he was also worried that those detained while waiting 
for a bus or coming home from a school play would have what amounted 
to a police record that could harm their future employment or 
educational prospects 
a police enforcement order indicated that those detained would 
not formally be charged but still would have their fingerprints 
taken and their names entered into a permanent police data bank 
once those names get in there how do you get them out 
richey asked 
barry anticipating legal opposition to the plan last week 
drafted an alternative bill richey ruled that he might extend the 
restraining order indefinitely if barrys alternative bill is not 
satisfactory 
barrys bill includes a broad range of exemptions from the 
curfew including starting the curfew at 1145 pm to allow 
teenagers time to return home from social events 
in addition it includes a blanket exemption for those returning 
from school or church functions and those traveling with parents or 
guardians 
barrys bill also attempts to resolve a conflict with 
constitutional freedom of assembly guarantees by allowing for 
teenagers to gather on city streets during curfew hours for 
protests or forums provided that police officials have been 
notified first 
both bills penalize parents not the teenagers starting with 
the second offense parents would be forced to pay a series of 
graduated fines ranging from 200 to 500

astronaut robert c springer had hoped 
something might go wrong on the fiveday voyage of discovery so he 
could leave the space shuttle to fix it his mother says 
bob was hoping for just some little problem so he could take a 
space walk betty springer said sunday from her sons home in 
seabrook texas 
instead the flight was almost perfect which suited mrs spring 
fine 
the only problem concerned an erratic pressure reading from a 
hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the orbiter the 
astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground controllers 
corrected the difficulty 
mrs springer and her husband walter watched the shuttle take 
off in cape canaveral then went to houston and watched on tv the 
landing saturday 
springer a 46yearold mission specialist aboard the shuttle 
returned to his home in the houston suburbs after the landing 
it still seems like a dream but he really liked his trip up 
into space his mother said 
springer was born in ashland ohio where his parents still live

the latest polls show voters favor a 
leftofcenter coalition over chancellor helmut kohls conservative 
government and a cabinet shakeup is in the works to arrest his 
partys tumble in popularity 
kohl is on his annual slimming down cure at a spa in austria but 
he announced before his departure from the capital on friday that he 
would spend his twoweek easter break considering changes in his 
coalition government 
in his absence west german media and prominent politicians have 
been speculating on the impending reorganization and some want the 
embattled chancellor to cut down his own portfolio by resigning as 
party leader 
an atmosphere of political crisis has marred kohls christian 
democratic union for more than a week and called into question 
whether the cdu can stay in power after the next federal balloting 
in december 1990 
the prospect of a liberal coalition governing in bonn portends a 
major policy shift in west germany an important us ally where a 
leftist and pacifist trend has been gaining ground for more than a 
year 
major newspapers on monday continued to give the political 
turmoil top priority as they did over the weekend when new opinion 
polls were released showing a further slide in support for kohls 
cdu and the centrist free democratic party with which it is aligned 
a survey conducted by the respected emnid institute indicates 
more interest among west germans for an alliance between the liberal 
social democrats and the environmentalist greens party the 
hamburgbased weekly welt am sonntag reported the poll shows a 
majority of voters would back a liberal alliance but it did not 
provide specific figures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a poll of 1018 west germans conducted by the voter research 
group of mannheim showed only 30 percent support kohls policies 
when the same questions were put to respondents a year ago 83 
percent supported kohl according to the zdf television network that 
commissioned the poll 
both opinion surveys showed the cdu trailing the social 
democrats as have similar polls over the past month 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
kohls popularity and that of the cdu have suffered from a 
scandal over west german companies involvement with a libyan 
chemical weapons plant and bonns footdragging over whether to 
support nato plans to replace some aging lance missiles with 
longerrange rockets 
domestic issues such as the unpopular reform that made health 
care more expensive have also contributed to cdu troubles 
the cdus problems have rubbed off on its coalition partner the 
free democrats who have also been losing ground in recent elections 
and opinion polls 
the christian democrats have been losing ground in state 
elections since kohl was reelected in 1987 most recently in hesse 
state balloting where the party lost control of the frankfurt city 
government and other important industrial centers 
the hesse setbacks followed a surprising loss jan 29 in 
elections to the berlin legislature in which the left and far right 
posted gains the citystate that had been controlled by the cdu for 
more than a decade is now being governed by a coalition of social 
democrats and an umbrella group of leftists known as the alternative 
list 
in an effort to invigorate the cdu and boost its appeal to 
voters kohl is weighing calls from his party and the free democrats 
to cast off unpopular cabinet members like defense minister rupert 
scholz and health minister ursula lehr

a judge monday ordered the release of randall dale 
adams who was imprisoned for 12 years for the slaying of a police 
officer but whose guilt was questioned in the film the thin blue 
line 
adams was ordered released on a 50000 personal recognizance 
bond and he was expected to be freed later in the day 
adams served 12 years in a texas prison for the 1976 slaying of 
dallas police officer robert wood originally sentenced to death 
adams sentence was commuted to life in 1980 
his conviction was unanimously overturned by the texas court of 
criminal appeals march 1

state district judge larry baraka of dallas who said after a 
hearing in december that adams did not receive a fair trial 
baraka ordered adams released on bond but he refused a motion by 
adams attorney randy schaffer of houston to dismiss the 
indictment 
prosecutors did not appear for the bond hearing monday afternoon 
the dallas county district attorney has not made a decision whether 
to retry adams 
adams case was resurrected with the help of new york filmmaker 
errol morris whose documentary the thin blue line strongly 
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecutions chief 
witness david harris harris who is on death row for another 
slaying was not charged in the shooting of wood

the supreme court was urged monday to overturn 
a 200000 libel award against a hamilton ohio newspaper 
a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the award makes a 
mirage of the required appellate court review of libel lawsuits 
won by public figures the justices were told 
the central difficulty of the court of appeals ruling is that 
it eviscerates the rule of independent review argued lee levine 
a washington lawyer for the hamilton journalnews 
the award was won by daniel connaughton a hamilton lawyer who 
unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 1983 
election against incumbent james h dolan 
john a lloyd of cincinnati a lawyer representing connaughton 
urged the justices to uphold his clients legal victory 
his evidence was massive his cause was just lloyd contended 
after accusing the newspaper of writing falsehoods about connaughton 
with perverse premeditated ignorance 
the courts decision expected by july could supply important 
new guidelines about how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury 
findings of actual malice when a public figure sues for libel 
about five weeks before the municipal judge election connaughton 
filed a private criminal complaint with hamilton police based on 
corruption allegations against billy new then the municipal courts 
chief administrative officer 
connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paid 
bribes to new to fix cases and that one of the women said some 
of the transactions had occurred in dolans presence 
new eventually was convicted of bribery dolan was not indicted 
connaughtons campaign contended that dolan bore the ultimate 
responsibility for any failure to manage the court or its 
employees 
a nov 1 1983 article in the journalnews said one of the women 
who offered grand jury testimony against new claims dan 
connaughton offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to florida 
in appreciation for their help 
the article quoted the woman as saying she thought connaughton 
used dirty tricks in obtaining her cooperation with his 
investigation of new 
connaughton sued hartehanks communications the newspapers 
publisher for libel a federal jury awarded him 5000 in 
compensatory damages and 195000 in punitive damages 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals upheld the award last year 
rejecting the newspapers arguments that a 1984 supreme court 
decision required a reversal of the verdict 
in a case called bose vs consumers union the nations highest 
court in 1984 said appeals courts have broad authority and a 
constitutionally required obligation to secondguess trial courts 
in libel cases filed by public figures 
to win a libel suit a public figure must prove the allegedly 
libelous statement was false and was made with actual malice 
knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity 
in the 1984 ruling the justices said appeals court judges must 
independently decide whether the evidence in the record is 
sufficient to cross a constitutional threshold that bars the entry 
of any libel judgment that is not supported by clear and 
convincing proof of actual malice 
in connaughtons case the 6th circuit court said the 1984 call 
for independent review does not apply to a cases facts but instead 
was limited to a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and 
convincing proof of actual malice 
attacking that ruling monday levine argued for the hamilton 
paper that the 6th circuit erected a presumption of actual malice 
in every case 
but lloyd contended that if the justices reverse connaughtons 
victory they would be erecting a rule of absolute immunity for 
the news media against libel suits by public figures 
he said a decision favoring the hamilton journalnews would 
send a signal to other defamed public figures to give up 
the case is hartehanks vs connaughton 8810

fidel chavez mena the christian 
democratic presidential candidate today acknowledged the victory of 
rightwing arena candidate alfredo cristiani in the presidential 
election 
as a democratic party we recognize the victory of alfredo 
cristiani with more than 50 percent of the vote chavez mena told 
a news conference i have called him personally to congratulate 
him and express my desire that god illuminate him in governing the 
country 
cristiani a wealthy coffee grower said sunday night his partys 
unofficial tally showed him leading with 54 percent of the vote with 
about 75 percent of the ballots counted 
leftists rebels tried to thwart the voting with nationwide 
attacks and the military said six soldiers and 23 guerrillas died 
in clashes during the balloting security forces killed three 
journalists two salvadorans and a dutchman 
the guerrillas today lifted the road transport ban that paralyzed 
traffic for four days but rebels sabotaged communications and power 
lines slowing the vote count 
we are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors said 
roberto daubuisson founder of the party known as arena 
jorge alberto diaz an arena delegate to the central elections 
council said that unofficially cristiani received 5496 percent of 
131832 votes counted by early today 
chavez mena a 49yearold lawyer was running second with 3448 
percent of votes counted with moran castaneda of the conservative 
national conciliation party third at 468 percent said diaz he 
told reporters he was speaking as the arena delegate and not for the 
elections council 
diaz did not say how many people voted or explain how the figures 
were obtained earlier today he said the results were delayed 
because local officials had trouble reporting results by telephone 
a cristiani victory would leave washington supporting a 
government run by a party long associated with extremism in 
elections last march arena wrested control of the national assembly 
from the christian democrats 
the rebels claimed a low voter turnout rendered the results 
meaningless 
their farabundo marti national liberation front had called for a 
boycott and mounted widespread attacks to keep voters at home 
although they promised not to attack those who went to the polls 
unofficial reports by a television station the us embassy and 
the leftist democratic convergence party indicated arena gained the 
majority needed to avoid a runoff 
a team of 21 us observers said the vote appeared to have been 
fair but one observer said violence frightened many people away 
there is no question that the intimidation of the rebels is 
working said william doherty an aflcio official on the team 
cristiani 41 campaigned as a moderate however at his side 
throughout the campaign was daubuisson a former army major accused 
of links to rightwing death squads 
the united states has sent 35 billion in military and economic 
aid to the government during its 9yearold war with the rebels that 
has left 70000 dead mostly civilians 
us policy in el salvador has been aimed at shoring up a 
centrist government represented by the christian democrats and 
president jose napoleon duarte who is dying of liver cancer and 
leaves office june 1 
some us lawmakers have said that if arena wins the united 
states should reevaluate its policy among the election observers 
was rep tony coelho dcalif who said congress will need to 
debate whether to continue current levels of military and economic 
aid 
the united states must recognize the will of salvadorans 
cristiani said in a television interview sunday night he said he 
saw no reason we cant have a relationship of mutual 
understanding 
us ambassador william walker said a victory for arena would not 
signify a defeat for american policy 
us policy here was not to project an image of being in 
support of a party or a candidate he told abcs good morning 
america from san salvador whatever party wins as long as 
theyre a democratic force as long as they observe human rights in 
this country we dont care really whether theyre right of center 
center or left of center 
government forces and leftist guerrillas battled in 12 of the 
countrys 14 provinces on sunday and combat prevented voting in four 
of the nations 262 municipalities no voting had been planned in 19 
others that were under rebel control 
col rene emilio ponce chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said the armed forces repelled what was in reality a nationwide 
offensive by the rebels 
the salvadoran correspondents association citing the deaths of 
the three journalists covering the vote accused the military of 
intimidation 
ponce said a soldier was arrested in one of the killings and the 
others were being investigated 
arenas campaign blamed the christian democrats for failing to 
end the war and for a steady economic slide 
cristiani has said arena will negotiate peace once the rebels put 
down their arms otherwise he has said they can expect an 
intensification of the stalemated war 
cristiani describes his economic policy as capitalism for the 
masses he is expected to return the national coffee company 
incafe to private hands and allow the return of private banks 
incafe and the banks were nationalized as part of usbacked duarte 
economic reforms 
about 183 million people out of a population of 5 million were 
eligible to vote

at the center of the controversy over bomb warnings 
before the pan am flight 103 disaster is a classic british political 
confrontation an old etonian millionaire cabinet minister vs an 
exwaiter leading an opposition onslaught 
for transport secretary paul channon son of a british brewing 
heiress and an american social highflyer the dec 21 crash in 
scotland was the low point in an unprecedented string of rail air 
and sea disasters in the past two years 
and from his departure for a vacation at his private villa in the 
caribbean on dec 23 through mounting charges the past five days 
that he bungled bomb warnings channon has been under concerted 
attack by john prescott a railmans son who is the opposition labor 
partys transport spokesman 
my response is one of contempt channon said over the 
weekend his behavior has been both callous and cynical he is 
exploiting the grief of the bereaved 
the latest furor began after a newspaper revealed last week that 
channons department warned british airlines nov 22 of a 
radiocassette bomb four days after the federal aviation department 
sent the same warning to us airlines including pan am 
a detailed description and picture of the bomb dated dec 19 was 
mailed in the new year by the transport department to british 
airlines and us airlines well after a bomb hidden in a 
radiocassette player brought down flight 103 over the scottish 
village of lockerbie killing 270 people 
despite unattributable briefings from conservative party prime 
minister margaret thatchers aides that she still supports him 
channon looks increasingly defensive as prescott hammers home 
charges of cavalier and secretive behavior 
channon has said the dec 19 warning was unimportant and that 
he didnt tell parliament about either warning because of the 
continuing inquiry and because the faa dealt with pan am 
said prescott this has all the signs of a coverup once they 
realized the bungle they had made of it all 
channon and prescott come from the extremes of mainstream british 
political life 
prescott 50 left school at age 15 to become a ships waiter and 
got to parliament after battling through the ranks of the national 
union of seamen 
channon 54 is reputedly the richest member of the thatcher 
cabinet he was born to privilege and politics and an inherited 
fortune as a member of the guinness brewing family 
his father sir henry channon came from a rich chicago family 
married into the guinness family and became a member of parliament 
after eton an elite guards regiment and oxford channon was 
elected to parliament at the age of 23 he was then its then 
youngest member representing a safe conservative party district 
southend west that had been held by his father and before that by 
two other family members 
however it took channon 27 years to get into the cabinet 
mrs thatcher named him trade and industry secretary in 1986 and 
in what was widely seen as a demotion moved him to transport after 
britains june 1987 general election 
channons 22yearold daughter olivia an oxford university 
student died of a drug overdose in 1986 after an aroundtheclock 
party at the university to celebrate final examinations 
three fellow undergraduates including a cousin and another 
guinness heir were charged with drug offenses raising a public 
outcry over a drugs scandal among the children of privilege 
since then channon has been one of the most publicized members 
of the 22member cabinet announcing in slightly tentative upper 
class tones another inquiry into yet another disaster his face 
anxious and solemn at another scene of carnage 
he took over transport during an inquiry into the march 1987 
british ferry disaster off the belgian port of zeebrugge that killed 
193 people and revealed lax safety procedures 
then followed a fire at londons kings cross subway station that 
killed 31 people in november 1987 the pan am disaster a british 
midland jet crash onto a highway on jan 8 killing 37 people and 
three major rail accidents since december that killed 42 people

the 50000 bristolmyers cancer research award 
has gone to peter k vogt of the university of southern california 
school of medicine for his discovery of a cancercausing gene that 
regulates other growthrelated genes it was announced monday 
the identification of the gene is one of the most significant 
discoveries in the last several years said philip sharp director 
of the center for cancer research at the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
sharp chaired the selection committee that chose vogt for the 
annual award 
vogt has also discovered several other cancer genes and has made 
important contributions to the study of virology bristolmyers said 
his is an astonishing record of sustained productivity 
unrelenting in its importance and impact wrote j michael bishop 
a noted cancer researcher in support of vogts selection the 
company said 
vogt discovered the socalled jun cancer gene which is partly 
responsible for switching other genes on and off inside living cells 
when the gene is altered it may send defective signals to the 
genes it governs producing the abnormalities seen in cancer 
vogt is the author of more than 210 scientific papers and was 
elected to the national academy of sciences in 1980 the company 
said 
he was selected by a 14member independent group of researchers

poison specialists on monday demonstrated a new 
childresistant medicine cap they hope will solve the problem of 
caps that are too difficult for the elderly to open 
in ceremonies marking the opening of national poison prevention 
week anne graham the acting chairman of the consumer product 
safety commission noted that roughly half the accidental medical 
poisonings of children under age 5 were from childresistant 
packages that had not been properly resecured or from nonchild 
resistance containers holding medicines originally packed in 
childresistant containers 
child poisonings have declined greatly with the advent of the 
childresistant caps from 216 deaths of children under 5 in 1972 to 
59 in 1986 
nonethess ms graham noted studies show that 35 percent of the 
medicines ingested in childpoisoning cases come from people not in 
the immediate family most frequently grandparents 
like the present mechanism the new cap device has an inner and 
outer cap that lock together when the outer cap is pressed down on 
the inner cap 
unlike the present design the inner and outer caps of the new 
mechanism each has a small slot across part of a diameter when the 
slots are aligned a spoon handle may be inserted into both to make 
the two caps turn together using the spoon as a lever without 
downward pressure on the outer cap 
this is our first effort said robert wygant professor of 
industrial engineering at western michigan university in kalamazoo 
at the news conference at the national capital poison control center 
at georgetown university hospital we have many other tests to 
do 
wygant developed the prototype cap from a design by professor 
hugh lockhart of michigan state university 
the design emerged from earlier work by western michigan 
university michigan state university and the university of 
wisconsin 
wygant who estimated that more than a billion caps are made for 
medicine alone every year said that among other problems to be 
solved was the production of clear instructions and making the caps 
easy to manufacture 
commission spokesmen said the commission plans to require use of 
the caps or something similar once all the bugs are worked out

almost a quartermillion soviets are living on land 
so contaminated by the chernobyl disaster that they must receive 
special food supplies to avoid overexposure to radiation the 
newspaper pravda said monday 
the communist party daily printed maps showing contaminated areas 
of byelorussia the ukraine and the russian republic in response to 
readers complaints they still didnt have full information about 
the level of contamination nearly three years after the accident 
it was accompanied by a commentary by pravda science editor v 
gubarev who criticized officials for trying to duck public concern 
about the safety of nuclear power 
yes it is impossible to get around using nuclear power 
stations however why then are they proposed for heavily populated 
or seismic zones gubarev asked why is the quality of 
construction so low and why does so much defective equipment arrive 
at nuclear plants and finally what is the source of this fear 
before a public which rightly demands a wide debate of every 
proposed nuclear power station 
yuri izrael chairman of the state committee for 
hydrometeorology said with decontamination efforts and food brought 
into the area those on the lands contaminated by cesium 137 can 
live safely without exceeding radiation limits set by the government 
soviet officials began bringing food supplies into areas 
surrounding the chernobyl plant shortly after the accident but they 
had not previously said how many people were living in those areas 
the publication came as soviet officials again started to move 
villagers who have continued to live in areas surrounding the plant 
since the accident in april 1986 that killed at least 31 people 
in february scientists decided that 20 byelorussian villages 
must be evacuated because over a lifetime their residents would 
receive an unacceptably high dose of radiation earlier this month 
officials announced that five villages in the ukraine also would be 
evacuated 
in november the soviet government set a maxium lifetime dose of 
35 rem roetgen equivalent man for exposure to radiation that 
figure has a comfortable margin of safety built into it izrael said 
izrael said the area of the three republics where the current 
level of radiation from both the environment and existing food 
supplies would expose residents to more than 35 rem includes 4000 
square miles including about 640 settlements with 230000 people 
that includes 800 square miles in the russian republic 600 
square miles in the ukraine and 2800 square miles in byelorussia 
including 1200 square miles in areas that have been evacuated 
so far they have gone the route here of trying to guarantee 
this population clean food and extra income izrael said 
izrael said studies showed that residents could remain safely as 
long as they did not eat the food especially meat and milk produced 
in the area which sharply increased the amount of radiation to 
which they were exposed 
he quoted the newspaper sovietskaya byelorussia as saying in a 
study of the gomel mogilev and brest regions of the republic less 
than 01 percent of the population had received an unacceptably high 
level of radiation as of last fall there had been no cases of 
radiation sickness he said 
scientists are debating how many more cancer deaths might be 
expected in the soviet union and europe as a result of the chernobyl 
accident in poland they have estimated there may be up to 200000 
deaths in the next 20 to 25 years from chernobyl radiation 
but izrael said that long years of work were ahead to 
decontaminate the region insufficiencies in this work must be 
compensated by replacement with clean food especially by bringing 
in milk in this case life and work is possible within the 
framework of the acceptable levels established by the soviet 
ministry of health he said 
izrael said that within the first days after the explosion and 
fire at the chernobyl plants no 4 reactor the direction of the 
wind made a complete circle and dropped radiation all around the 
plant 
the entire population living within 18 miles of the plant or 
about 135000 people were evacuated and resettled 
since then many soviets have begun to speak out against nuclear 
power citizens protests or tougher standards imposed after the 
chernobyl accident have stopped several nuclear power plants a 
plant near yerevan armenia not far from the site of the dec 7 
earthquake was shut down saturday

detectives whose partner was killed during a drug 
raid lied so many times to try to bring the alleged murderer to 
trial that they blew the case defense lawyers argued monday 
other lawyers say the admitted misconduct by police could also 
call into question dozens of convictions in which the officers 
participated 
defense attorneys and the prosecutor agreed during the superior 
court hearing monday that there was serious police misconduct in the 
case against albert lewin 33 accused of shooting the detective 
feb 17 1987 
but the prosecutor assistant district attorney francis omeara 
argued that lewin should stand trial because there is strong 
evidence against him and because the police have come clean by 
admitting they lied to obtain a search warrant and hid the identity 
of potential witnesses 
the three detectives carlos a luna 32 hugo amate 31 and 
paul schroeder 33 were suspended with pay while the attorney 
general investigates possible perjury 
judge charles m grabau dismissed the murder charge against lewin 
last month but agreed to consider reinstating it after the 
detectives filed affidavits last week admitting they previously lied 
grabau said he would rule next week whether lewin can be tried 
for the murder of detective sherman griffiths 
defense attorney max stern argued that the case against lewin is 
weak and depends heavily on testimony from other potential suspects 
who may be lying to protect themselves 
griffiths 36 was killed by a bullet shot through a door that he 
was trying to break down to execute a drug search warrant 
by the time his partners got through the steelreinforced door 
the thirdfloor apartment was empty they rushed down a back 
staircase and found lewin and six other people in an apartment on 
the first floor 
charges were later dropped against the others in return for 
damaging testimony against lewin 
a weakness in the prosecutions case from the outset was that 
lewin did not match the search warrants description of the cocaine 
dealer police said occupied the apartment and presumably fired the 
fatal shot 
an informant named john tipped detectives that drugs were being 
sold from the apartment by a 5foot6 inch hispanic man according 
to the police application for the warrant lewin is 6foot2 and 
jamaican 
after the judge ordered the detectives last year to bring the 
informant into court they said they couldnt find him 
in throwing out the case last month grabau said he believed the 
police had intentionally disobeyed his orders to produce the witness 
but in a stunning turnaround last week the detectives admitted 
john did not exist 
according to the affidavits the information attributed to john 
actually came from two other informants identified in court only as 
y and z 
omeara said monday the detectives created john to protect their 
real informants 
when the playing field is not level when its skewed when 
its fixed then the court system cant work stern said 
thats what you have here 
stern also said the detectives obtained at least 30 other 
warrants and conducted drug raids using information attributed to 
john 
martin rosenthal a staff member for the massachusetts committee 
for public counsel services said sunday that defense lawyers are 
now examining many of those cases and are likely to file motions for 
new trials 
where faulty warrants led to arrests and convictions he said 
convicted dealers could go free under a rule that bars evidence 
obtained through police misconduct 
harvey silverglate cochairman of the 320member massachusetts 
association of criminal defense lawyers said the lewin case has 
revealed what many lawyers suspected all along 
anybody who practices criminal law here can tell you that we 
have great skepticism about these warrants silverglate said

an ammonia tank exploded at a factory in lithuania 
on monday killing at least two people and injuring 41 state media 
said 
the blast released a cloud of gas into the air that was being 
pushed eastward by the wind but officials said it was unlikely that 
any populated areas would have to be evacuated 
a government commission was formed to investigate the cause of 
the blast at the azot factory in ionava about 45 miles northwest of 
the lithuanian capital of vilnius the official tass news agency 
said the tank contained about 7000 cubic meters of ammonia 
it took firefighters several hours to put out blazes that broke 
out and an unspecified number of people were evacuated near the 
plant lithuanias deputy premier yl rusenko told soviet 
television 
i think that the concentration will not be increased because 
all the ammonium has practially been evaporated above ionava he 
said 
if it is necessary people will be evacuated in other regions 
if a cloud approaches and the concentration is high but i think the 
danger has passed rusenko said 
residents were warned about the explosion and the release of 
ammonia by official radio after the late morning explosion he said 
without being specific tass said that security had been tightened 
residents of lithuania and the other soviet baltic republics of 
latvia and estonia are concerned about environmental damage caused 
by the heavy concentration of industry in the almost 50 years since 
they were absorbed into the soviet union 
many people blame the central government in moscow for ordering 
the heavy industrialization without showing concern for 
environmental damage

deng xiaoping chinas 84yearold leader was 
conspicuous by his absence from fridays opening of the nations 
annual legislative session 
as the national peoples congress opened western reporters 
sitting in the balcony of the huge great hall of the people clutched 
their binoculars and scanned the dais for the countrys senior 
statesman they came up empty 
an official from the ministry of foreign affairs would say only 
that deng had asked for leave from the conference chen yun 
another elderly leader who heads the communist partys advisory 
committee had done the same she said 
deng attended the opening last years opening session as a 
delegate from sichuan province he sat between communist party chief 
zhao ziyang and premier li peng 
this year president yang shangkun took dengs seat 
no empty seats appeared to have been set aside for the man who 
fathered chinas current economic reforms in 1978 two seats were 
empty on the left side of the dais not traditionally the places for 
highranking officials 
although he remains the power behind party and state in china 
deng officially only has charge of the military 
as the peoples liberation army does not report directly to the 
national peoples congress his presence at the meeting is not 
mandatory 
still dengs absence and the reaction it created among members 
of the western press illustrates one of the difficulties of 
understanding chinese politics much here is done for effect but 
often it is difficult to tell what the desired effect is 
deng last was seen friday when he greeted thai prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan in beijing 
he appeared spry and remarked that chatichai had played golf with 
zhao the day before 
im also a sportsman deng said i play bridge

its easier to buy and register a handgun in 
illinois than to apply for a drivers license two lawmakers said 
monday in proposing a package of laws to keep better track of 
weapons and their owners 
residents now can obtain a firearm owners identification card by 
mail the card is valid for five years and allows its possessor to 
keep as many weapons of any kind as desired without reporting the 
total number or serial numbers 
under the legislation proposed by democratic state sens william 
marovitz and phil rock owners would have to get separate id cards 
for each handgun and fill out the applications at a local law 
enforcement agency 
the card would be good for three years and applicants would have 
to furnish more detailed personal history than currently required 
chicago police supterintendent leroy martin said chicagos crime 
rate dipped last year and said his forces confiscation of 14000 
weapons had a significant effect 
over 50 percent of the 14000 cant be identified he said 
if we could trace them it would make a big difference we know 
people are buying the guns and selling them or renting them to 
gangs and this would enable us to follow some of the weapons back 
to the source 
james zangrilli a member of the national rifle associations 
board of directors objected to the legislation 
many states and localities have taken steps limiting gun sales or 
possession in recent weeks president bush last week ordered a 
temporary ban on imports of assault rifles

warned businesses and public institutions that soviet intelligence 
has obtained passwords and codes to gain access into their computers

apparently were passed to the soviet kgb by three west german 
hackers arrested this month

passwords from western military and research computers to soviet

police authorities investigating the case have determined that 
the hackers allegedly planned to break into or succeeded in breaking 
into many other computers the statement said 
the kgb is capable of gaining full access to computer data of 
businesses and public institutions it added 
it said obtaining computer codes and passwords has become a new 
type of espionage by the east

former rep michael barnes testified monday 
that former cia director william casey tried to discredit a 
congressional committee staff member at a time the panel was 
investigating oliver norths efforts on behalf of nicaraguan rebels 
he indicated that a member of my staff had met with a 
representative of the nicaraguan government said barnes a 
maryland democrat the cia barnes said found out about the meeting 
by intercepting a conversation between the nicaraguan ambassador and 
that countrys foreign minister 
barnes identified the staff member as victor johnson who was 
staff director of the subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs at 
the time in late 1985 when official aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
was forbidden by us law barnes subcommittee was trying to pry 
information from the national security council on its activities 
his voice rising the former congressman strongly denied there 
was anything wrong with johnsons contact with the nicaraguan 
government 
my memory of what casey said is that a member of my staff had 
met with a representative of the nicaraguan government said 
barnes he told them if they were to improve the human rights 
situation in their country lifting martial law restoring freedom 
of the press such steps could be of help to members of congress 
trying to reject aid to the contras 
did he indicate to you the staff member gave classified 
information asked brendan sullivan norths lawyer 
no sir barnes said i found the allegation he made 
basically to be frivolous he didnt allege a member of my staff was 
passing classified information to the nicaraguan government on the 
contrary from what he told me my staff was doing what it had 
routinely done 
i told him in my judgment based on what he told me that what 
this individual had done was perfectly appropriate 
casey died in early 1987 
barnes who left his house seat to make an unsuccessful try for 
the senate in 1986 said after meeting with casey he told the 
chairman of the full foreign affairs committee about the 
conversation and he agreed the meeting was appropriate 
the former democratic congressman told sullivan heatedly there 
was never any allegation that victor johnson or any other member of 
my staff had provided classified information in any form to the 
nicaraguan government or any other government 
barnes one of the leaders against aid to the contras also 
testified monday that thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane had seemed very nervous about the questions being 
raised about norths activities 
barnes said he was dissatisfied with a sept 12 1985 letter 
from mcfarlane denying that nsc staffers were raising money and 
offering tactical advice to the guerrillas fighting the leftist 
nicaraguan government 
they met in mcfarlanes white house office and mcfarlane offered 
to let barnes but no congressional staffers examine documents 
relating to the contras 
north who was on mcfarlanes staff is being tried on charges 
that he obstructed congress and made false statements in connection 
with the sept 12 letter and two others written in 1985 
were you aware that north collaborated with mr mcfarlane on 
writing that letter prosecutor michael bromwich asked no 
barnes said 
he said that in a later letter to mcfarlane and in the 
facetoface meeting he requested all documents relating to 
communications between the united states government and the contras 
i felt that mr mcfarlane was very concerned about our 
investigation very nervous about it barnes said 
barnes said he rejected mcfarlanes offer to let him alone look 
at the documents saying it was always necessary in such cases to 
have knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them 
the next witness after barnes thomas latimer staff director of 
the house intelligence committee testified about attempts by his 
committee chairman in september 1986 to follow continuing reports 
that the nsc was violating the prohibition against helping the 
contras 
latimer set up an aug 6 meeting between north and the committee 
in the white house north spoke for 4045 minutes he said denying 
again that he had violated the law 
he was asked specifically if he had given any miitary advice to 
the contras latimer said he said he had not he was asked if 
he was involved in any fundraising he said he had not 
one of the obstructionofcongress charges against north is based 
on his answers at that meeting under the ground rules set by the 
national security council no transcript was made but the 
prosecution introduced the notes that latimer made at the time 
they reflected that north said he had explained the boland 
amendment restrictions to the contra but never violated 
stricture and merelygave advice on human rights civic action 
programs 
testimony at the trial has indicated that north made many 
speeches to potential donors to the contra cause although he left 
the pitches for money to others and that he gave extensive advice 
to the nicaraguan rebels

diplomats and ministers from 111 
nations met monday for a unsponsored toxic waste conference to 
culminate in a treaty regulating international trafficking of 
dangerous products 
but african delegations demanded alterations in the 51page draft 
document and threatened to stall the threeday meeting 
if approved the treaty formally gives all signing countries the 
right to refuse imports of hazardous wastes and requires exporters 
to provide prospective recipients details of shipments 
signatories will pledge to dispose of dangerous waste in an 
environmentally sound way and also will commit to keep international 
toxic waste traffic to a minimum 
mostafa tolba executive director of the united nations 
environment program said international hazardous waste trade is 
threatening public health and the environment 
at least 100000 shipments of toxic waste crosses international 
borders annually in a commerce of poison worth billions of 
dollars tolba told delegates at the opening session 
tolba said the basel treaty would signal the end of uncontrolled 
hazardous waste transport 
but malis environment minister morifing kone speaking for the 
organization of african unity said the treaty contains gaps he 
said some african nations want a guarantee that industrialized 
countries wont use developing areas as a dumping ground for 
poisonous wastes 
greenpeace the international environmental group on monday 
criticized the treaty for not covering radioactive waste and 
allowing member countries to sign waste trade pacts with nonmember 
nations 
the problem of international trafficking in dangerous wastes was 
dramatized last year when several waste shipments from 
industrialized countries were found dumped in african nations 
including nigeria and guinea wasteladen ships traveled from port 
to port looking for a place to dispose of their cargo 
environmentalists said they were concerned that importing toxic 
waste had become a source of income for poor countries with no safe 
disposal plans 
europes attention was drawn to the problem earlier when barrels 
of toxic waste from italys seveso chemical plant spill vanished in 
1982 before turning up months later in france the incident led to 
the adoption of european community rules on crossborder dangerous 
waste transport

catholic extremists 
on sunday gunmen stormed a belfast home and killed a man while 
he said his prayers with his wife 
eamonn mallie a reporter for downtown radio in belfast said the 
slain officers were a constabulary divisional commander and his

inside the british province of northern ireland the area was sealed 
off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops 
moved in 
seamus mallon an opposition member of parliament from northern 
ireland said the deaths of the two officers were a calculated and 
brutal act of slaughter carried out by people for whom murder has 
become a way of life 
northern ireland secretary tom king pledged that the security 
forces would take every possible step to combat the wave of 
retaliatory murders 
king the british cabinet minister responsible for northern 
ireland discussed the violence monday with deputy police chief 
michael mcatamney of the royal ulster constabulary 
what the ruc and all the security forces need at this time is 
the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of 
violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these 
evil groups he said afterwards 
david braniff 63 and a father of 13 was shot dead in his north 
belfast home sunday night neighbors said two gunmen burst into 
braniffs house and shot him at pointblank range they said he died 
with his rosary in his hands

braniff a catholic was a bricklayer who had been a protestant 
before he married he had british flags tattooed on his arms and 
worked in protestant areas of belfast 
on friday catholic civil servant niall davies 42 was shot in 
his home apparently in retaliation for the ira killing the previous 
night of jackie irvine 49 a former commander of the protestant 
paramilitary ulster volunteer force 
the latest round of killings began feb 12 when catholic attorney 
patrick finucane was shot in his home the protestant underground 
ulster freedom fighters said they killed him because he was an ira 
officer his widow denied it 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the province with the catholic irish 
republic to the south while the protestant majority wants to remain 
under the british flag

a massive stockpile of governmentowned grain 
and other commodities has been reduced to about half what it was a 
year ago the agriculture department reported monday 
the departments commodity credit corp which handles price 
support operations said the value of products under its control as 
of dec 31 totaled 158 billion down from 296 billion a year 
earlier 
under ccc programs when a crop is placed by farmers under price 
support loan the commodity cannot be sold or used by producers 
until the loan is settled in many cases when market prices fail to 
rise enough to make it worthwhile to pay off the loans farmers 
forfeit the commodity to the ccc which then holds it as 
inventory or surplus 
as of dec 31 the ccc had loans outstanding on 11 billion worth 
of commodities and held 48 billion in its inventories a year 
earlier ccc holdings were 173 billion and 123 billion 
respectively 
last years drought which cut production sharply helped force 
up market prices and ease the ccc load overseas demand also has 
been a factor domestic use and also higher market prices or changes 
in program policies have been other reasons 
in the case of corn and other feed grains for example the dec 
31 total held by ccc was about 236 billion bushels valued at 777 
billion including both loans and inventory a year earlier feed 
grains totaled 752 billion bushels worth 167 billion 
the dec 31 wheat total was less than 768 million bushels valued 
at 269 billion down from 177 billion bushels worth 599 billion 
a year earlier 
holdings of dairy products bought by ccc to support the price of 
milk paid to farmers totaled 4547 million pounds valued at 6022 
million compared with 116 billion pounds and 143 billion a year 
earlier

opposition parties said monday that local elections 
show voters want prime minister noboru takeshitas government to 
quit but the ruling party said political reform would win back the 
peoples confidence 
chief government spokesman keizo obuchi dismissed opposition 
calls for general elections saying sundays ballot was a 
gubernatorial election to select the governor and not a referendum 
the ruling liberal democratic party candidate narrowly defeated a 
communist contender to win the governorship of chiba province 
neighboring tokyo 
newspapers said monday the result showed waning support for the

gov mario cuomo told a college audience 
monday that new york state must show leadership in this hour of 
fright and then vetoed the latest legislation that would restore 
the death penalty 
before issuing his seventh consecutive veto cuomo defended his 
opposition to the death penalty before a rally of about 400 people 
at albanys roman catholic college of st rose he again urged 
lawmakers to approve his alternative of life without parole for some 
murderers 
the people of new york ought now in this hour of fright to show 
the way cuomo said we should refuse to allow this time to be 
marked forever in the pages of history as a time that we were driven 
back to one of the vestiges of our primitive condition because we 
were not strong enough to find a better end to the violence 
it was the opening salvo of what is expected to be an intense 
legislative battle new york is one of 13 states without an operable 
death penalty law new york which introduced the electric chair to 
the world in 1890 has not executed anyone since 1963 
with a crack epidemic and its accompanying violence sweeping 
through new york city supporters of the death penalty in the 
legislature claim theyll have enough votes to override cuomos 
veto an override attempt is expected in june 
i know that this society should strive for something better 
than we are in our worst moments cuomo said it isnt easy for 
people to hold back their anger but that is the only rational 
course 
cuomo said theres no persuasive evidence the death penalty 
deters murderers he said most would be more frightened by the 
thought of spending the rest of their lives in prison 
both houses of new yorks legislature have already approved the 
latest death penalty bill for the 13th consecutive year cuomo has 
vetoed the legislation every year hes been in office as did former 
gov hugh carey in the six years before that

andrei d sakharov urged members of the academy of 
sciences on monday to reject the leaderships list of candidates for 
the new soviet legislature which does not include the nobel peace 
prize winner 
the 67yearold nuclear physicist and human rights activist who 
won the nobel in 1975 said in a speech to the academy that many 
scientists objected to the slate for sundays election approved by 
the leadership in january 
sakharov and several other wellknown proponents of reform are 
missing from the list the official news agency tass quoted him as 
saying however that scientists were upset not because sakharov 
was not nominated but because the role of scientific institutions 
was ignored 
he called for reversal of what he called the antidemocratic 
decision which produced a list of what critics describe as 
oldguard managers of scientific institutions 
a vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for tuesday 
sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a 
seat in the new 2250member congress of peoples deputies but he 
decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an academy of 
sciences seat 
under an election law approved in december 750 seats in the 
legislature are reserved for the communist party and its affiliates 
and for professional social and trade union organizations the 
other 1500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 soviet 
republics and their electoral districts 
those in the academy who support sakharov hope to force a new 
round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all 
nominees a majority said andrei mironov a former political 
prisoner 
that would force the academy to start over and produce a new list 
of nominees under terms of the new election law 
twentyfive seats were allotted to the academy but it gave five 
to affiliated societies and associations from 121 nominees the 
academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats 
although 60 research institutes nominated sakharov he was not 
chosen for the final slate the leaderships decision inspired 
widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academys 
moscow headquarters 
tass said 1108 academicians corresponding members and 
representatives of reseach institutes attended the threeday meeting 
that began monday 
the first three days of this week may become the hottest 
spring days for soviet scientists it said alluding to the 
leaderships rejection of such reformers as sakharov space 
scientist roald sagdeev and sociologist tatyana zaslavsakaya 
the agency acknowledged many scientists were unsatisfied with 
the slate of candidates 
mironov said two other academicians also spoke on monday in favor 
of new nominations no details of their remarks were available

residential telephone users feel theyre 
receiving about the same quality of service they got before the 
breakup of the american telephone amp telegraph co and business 
customers think their service has improved according to a federal 
analysis of phone company surveys 
the percentage of residential customers who reported they were 
satisfied with their phone service climbed from about 931 percent 
to about 941 percent from 1985 to june 1988 the federal 
communications commission concluded 
small business user satisfaction increased from about 916 
percent in 1985 to near 942 percent in the first half of 1988 the 
most recent period for which figures are available the fcc said 
large business user satisfaction climbed from about 903 percent 
in 1985 to 947 percent in mid1988 the commission said 
residence customer perceptions have not changed significantly 
since 1985 while business perceptions have noticeably improved 
it said 
the fcc study released last week was based upon semiannual 
reports the commission has required the seven baby bell 
companies to file in the wake of the 1984 atampt divestiture 
the bell company reports were broken down into five broad 
categories for analysis customer satisfaction dial tone delay 
transmission quality on time service orders and equipment failure 
and blocking 
in the areas of customer perception transmission quality and 
dial tone speed the companies generally improved since 1985 
the companies do show some decline with respect to on time service 
performance for residential customers the report said 
the percentage of customers satisfied with dial tone speed a 
connection within three seconds rose from about 976 percent in 
1985 to nearly 989 percent in 1988 transmission quality 
satisfaction climbed from about 899 percent to 945 percent 
however on time service order satisfaction for residential users 
fell from 981 percent in 1985 to 97 percent in june 1988 the 
report said 
the report covered the local phone companies operated by us 
west southwest bell bellsouth nynex pacific telesis bell 
atlantic and ameritech 
the commission cautioned that data collected from state public 
utilities commissions may be more detailed and that the data should 
not be used to compare companies 
the individual reports provided by the companies tend to 
obscure trends since the indices almost always register over 90 
percent the commission said

the recent spurt of inflation is raising fears 
of a recession with some economists predicting monday that a 
downturn could begin in the second half of 1989 
these analysts believe that the federal reserve faced with 
alarming news of increasing price pressures will squeeze credit so 
tightly that an economic slump will be all but inevitable 
once you get inflation up to the levels we have right now it 
has taken a recession to cool things off that is an unfortunate 
fact of life said bruce steinberg senior economist at the new 
york investment firm of merrill lynch 
inflation worries were heightened last friday when the government 
reported that prices at the wholesale level had shot up a full 
percentage point for the second straight month 
it was the worst backtoback inflation news in nearly eight 
years and it sent stock and bond prices plunging as investors 
worried that the federal reserve would be forced to drive interest 
rates higher in an effort to dampen demand 
markets continued to be battered by inflation worries on monday 
with the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks falling 2964 
points to close at 226250 after a 4857 point drop on friday the 
worst oneday loss in nearly a year 
investors were braced for an even bigger market drop tuesday if 
the governments monthly check of consumer prices comes in with a 
worsethanexpected number 
economists were looking for consumer prices to rise by about 05 
percent in february they feared that a figure as high as 07 
percent could send markets into a tailspin even a 05 percent 
increase would translate into an annual advance above 6 percent 
sharply higher than the price increases of 44 percent or less 
during the past seven years 
the bush administration sought to play down inflation worries on 
monday with white house spokesman marlin fitzwater telling reporters 
that a number of recent business reports paint a picture of a 
slowing economy which will be enough to break any inflationary 
pressures 
but private ecoomists said fears were now so widespread that the 
federal reserve will be forced to take actions that will likely send 
a variety of consumer and business interest rates higher 
we are looking at potentially the worst inflationary bout since 
the late 1970s and early 1980s said allen sinai chief economist 
of the boston co it is a policy problem of immense proportions 
for the federal reserve and it will require sharply higher interest 
rates and potentially a recession to deal with 
starting a year ago the central bank under chairman alan 
greenspan began gradually nudging interest rates higher in an 
effort to keep inflation from getting out of control 
some economists complained that the fed was too tentative 
especially in the second half of 1988 and now is faced with the 
need to slam on the brakes 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer predicted that the federal reserve 
would boost the discount rate the rate it charges to make loans to 
financial institutions two or more times in coming months 
the fed increased the discount rate to 7 percent on feb 24 in a 
move widely seen as a signal that it intended to move more strongly 
against inflationary pressures 
the fed gave up on gradualism in february jones said now 
that they have become tougher and more aggressive it makes the 
danger of a recession greater 
both steinberg at merrill lynch and sinai said they were now 
forecasting recessions the merrill lynch forecast calls for a mild 
downturn to begin in the julyseptember quarter this year while 
sinai said he was not looking for a downturn until early next year 
however other economists while forecasting slower growth said 
there was still a chance that the fed would be able to achieve its 
hoped for soft landing where growth slows enough to ease 
inflationary pressures but not enough to mean an end to the 
sixyearlong economic recovery from the severe 198182 recsssion 
a recession occurs when businesses get nervous and start laying 
off people i dont see that happening said michael evans head 
of a washington forecasting firm businessmen are still optimistic 
and they are holding on to their qualified employees 
but the shadow open market committee a group of economists who 
monitor federal reserve actions released a report monday saying 
that the central bank had increased the risk of a recession by 
its recent actions 
politicians are worried as well six republican senators last 
week signed a letter complaining about the feds inflationfighting 
efforts 
if the fed persists in tightening credit and raising interest 
rates we fear it will sow the seeds of a recession said the 
letter signed by sens bob kasten rwis don nickles rokla 
steve symms ridaho connie mack rfla trent lott rmiss and 
orrin hatch rutah

four black detainees on a 
hunger strike escaped monday from a johannesburg hospital fled 38 
miles to pretoria and took refuge at the west german embassy there 
officials said 
the four men who were held without charge for between 10 months 
and 23 months demanded that the government guarantee that they and 
all other political detainees will be freed 
we have committed no crime the escapees said in a statement 
we have been kept in detention for so long that we felt we had to 
embark on a lifeanddeath hunger strike to dramatize our plight in 
detention and to ultimately secure our immediate release 
west german embassy counselor klaus bonnemann said monday night 
they can stay and we will not make them leave against their will 
he said the men will have access to medical treatment if needed 
hundreds of detainees have taken part in hunger strikes since 
january demanding to be released or put on trial the government 
says it freed more than 400 detainees in the past month and that 
about 350 remain in custody 
an estimated 30000 people have been held without charge for 
varying lengths of time since the state of emergency was imposed 33 
months ago 
foreign minister pik botha said his government is in contact with 
the west germans and the matter was receiving attention botha 
did not say what actions south africa plans 
the men said through the detainees aid center that they belong to 
organizations affiliated with the banned united democratic front 
the countrys largest antiapartheid coalition 
they identified themselves as job sithole 21 ephraim nkoe 28 
mpho lekgoro 24 and clive radebe 28 all are from the townships 
around johannesburg and pretoria and have been active in various 
youth and student organizations their statement said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
the men did not disclose how they escaped from the hospital and 
got to the west german embassy 
but lawyer priscilla jana who met the men monday evening told 
the south african press association the four took a taxi from the 
hospital to the embassy 
journalists were not allowed inside the embassy but from the 
gates four black men clad in tshirts and jeans could be seen 
standing in the foyer of the building 
the embassy surrounded by 13foot high walls is less than a 
halfmile from union buildings south africas administrative 
capital 
people have escaped from south african custody and taken refuge 
in foreign diplomatic missions several times in recent years 
most recently three detainees escaped from a hospital in 
september and holed up in the us consulate in johannesburg for 
more than 40 days before deciding to leave the south african 
government promised the three men all united democratic front 
members would not be detained or restricted once they left the 
consulate the three have spoken regularly on behalf of the 
organization in recent months 
in another incident klaas de jonge a dutch citizen accused of 
smuggling weapons for the african national congress guerrilla 
movement took refuge in the dutch consulate in pretoria for more 
than two years before he was returned to the netherlands in 
september 1987 in an exchange involving prisoners in four countries

victoria burton 11 shivering in a cold wind 
on the first day of spring sang the national anthem at an empty 
robert f kennedy stadium better than three other children and 29 
adults monday and won the right to sing it again with the sun 
presumably warmer and the stands fuller 
the girl from the baltimore suburb of cockeysville won an 
audition to sing the starspangled banner on april 2 the day 
before the baseball season begins for real at an exhibition game 
between the baltimore orioles and the st louis cardinals two 
foreign teams named after birds 
the nations capital has been without a team since the second set 
of senators headed west to dallasfort worth in 1972 that version 
of the senators had been created as an expansion club by baseballs 
rulers in 1961 to fill the void when the first senators skipped town 
for minneapolis 
victoria wearing a bow in her hair and braces on her teeth said 
she was nervous but not at all worried about forgetting the words 
she said she had known the words by heart for years 
her mother sarah burton said victoria started singing even 
before she learned to walk 
she recalled that when victoria was in the second grade her 
teacher called and said ive got to talk to you about your 
daughter 
i thought shed done something terrible mrs burton said 
but when i went to school he said shes got this remarkable 
voice weve got to do something about it 
victoria joined the maryland childrens chorus she also sings at 
dinner theaters and her mother said at every opportunity 
for several hours the national anthem echoed in the empty 
stadium contestants sat in highpriced seats along the first base 
line awaiting the chance to stand at a microphone behind home plate 
and sing 
among them were mike ferraro 57 needing a shave just off the 
nightshift at the merrifield va post office who carried the

alfredo cristiani used his own 
commercial success and public discontent with a long civil war to 
overcome his partys image of an ultraright movement linked to 
death squads 
cristiani who claimed victory in sundays presidential election 
says his republican nationalist alliance party known as arena is a 
political force no one can ignore 
arena was founded by roberto daubuisson a former army major 
frequently accused of organizing rightwing death squads and many 
people wonder whether cristiani runs the party or is a figurehead 
for daubuisson 
before the election cristiani said the us government cannot 
dismiss his party in the simplistic manner it did in the past 
we consider the united states our natural ally but it cannot 
come and impose models or conditions said cristiani who attended 
georgetown university in washington 
us administrations have criticized daubuisson who was 
dismissed from the army in 1980 on grounds of plotting a coup the 
party founder denies the allegations against him 
daubuisson formed the party in 1981 it has gained popularity in 
recent years and it won a slim legislative majority in 1988 which 
puts it in the position of controlling both the legislative and 
executive branches 
cristiani a 41yearold coffee farmer and distributor of medical 
supplies appealed in the campaign to el salvadors traditionally 
conservative middle and upper classes and to others tired of a 
9yearold war that has taken more than 70000 lives 
id rather be sitting in my office than running for 
president he said in a preelection interview i am here 
because i am convinced that my country can progress if we are free 
in every sense of the word and adopt an economic model for 
development 
at his side throughout the campaign was daubuisson stirring up 
the crowds at rallies 
daubuisson lost the 1984 presidential election to christian 
democrat jose napoleon duarte cristiani a member of arena since 
1982 became the party president in 1985 when daubuisson stopped 
down from that post 
daubuisson is currently an arena representative in the national 
assembly and is still referred to by many party members as maximum 
leader 
cristiani who has not been linked to the death squads was 
elected to the national assembly in 1985 and reelected last year 
in a recent interview by the associated press christiani was 
asked why daubuisson had quit as arena president 
he recognized that his figure and all that had been said about 
him was prejudicial to the partys image he said 
cristiani also commented on the united states and daubuisson 
daubuisson personally cannot expect the support of the united 
states he said even if he were to be born again his image 
could not be changed there they damaged it so much beyond 
salvation 
cristiani blames arenas image problem on the foreign news media 
especially the us media he also has criticized the us 
government for what he calls the distortion of arenas image 
cristiani is a tall angular man with a soft voice graying 
moustache and hair combed straight back an exemplar of the economic 
class that blames the military and politicians of the past for the 
nations ills 
we may be conservative he said of arena but we are the 
only party that has defined the social problems of the country and 
that offers a solution 
he said president duarte barred by the consitution from seeking 
reelection failed to end the war and solve economic problems 
we must have a clear economic model a free market that 
benefits all sectors of society avoid protectionism and let the 
government take care only of those services where private business 
will not enter he said 
peace is a viable probablity if leftist guerrillas join the 
democratic process he said 
if they dont the alternative is efficient professional use 
of the armed forces but we would rather sit down and talk about a 
national peace proposal so we all may reenter a peaceful life 
cristiani declared 
some objectives have been achieved and the main thing is that 
all political parties are participating in the election 
ana guadalupe martinez a member of the rebel political 
commission said in an interview in mexico city that cristiani is on 
the rational right but she fears daubuisson is the power 
behind the throne

the minister of justice and labor under 
deposed president alfredo stroessner was charged monday under a law 
he often used to harass political dissidents 
also monday a chilean convicted of participating in the 
september 1980 assassination of anastasio somoza who was ousted as 
president of nicaragua in july 1979 said he will appeal a police 
order expelling him from paraguay 
charges filed by attorney general diogenes martinez said the 
former minister jose eugenio jacquet would attack opponents of 
the former regime calling them subversives and implicating them in 
terrorist plans 
jacquets statements and actions were an open incitement to 
violence to disobedience of laws and a form of preaching hate 
between paraguayans the document said 
law 209 titled in defense of public peace and the freedom of 
persons says anyone convicted of inciting violence or urging 
people to disobey laws can be given a jail sentence of one month to 
three years 
preaching hate between paraguayans carries a sentence of one 
to six years 
the law also forbids defaming the president or his ministers it 
often was used to detain opposition leaders for several days and 
sometimes for months 
excerpts of martinezs charges published by the newspaper ultima 
hora cited an occasion in 1987 when jacquet threatened to 
neutralize those who criticized the ruling colorado partys 
leadership 
gen stroessner was deposed feb 3 by gen andres rodriguez a 
longtime associate after ruling paraguay for nearly 35 years 
opposition leaders have asked rodriguez to repeal the law 
manuel modesto esquivel former director of the postal service 
also was charged with violating law 209 days before the coup he

the payment of monthly imminent danger 
bonuses to sailors deployed in the persian gulf will come to an end 
april 1 the pentagon said monday 
the bonuses previously known as hostile fire or combat pay are 
worth 110 a month and have been paid to servicemen working inside 
the persian gulf since august 25 1987 
defense sources disclosed almost two months ago that gen h 
norman schwarzkopf the head of the us central command had 
recommended an end to the bonuses because the truce in the iraniraq 
war was continuing to hold 
adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
approved the recommendation recently and officials in the defense 
departments manpower office then signed the order monday said 
william caldwell a pentagon spokesman 
according to pentagon statistics about 16 million has been paid 
out in danger bonuses since august 1987 before the ceasefire took 
hold in the iraniraq war last august about 8000 servicemen were 
receiving the payments every month 
while most of those receiving the bonuses were deployed on ships 
in the region or flew warplanes over the persian gulfs waters 
servicemen assigned to small bases in bahrain and kuwait were also 
eligible as a result about 1300 women also received the bonuses 
at one point or another the pentagon said 
according to defense officials who declined to be identified 
schwarzkopf concluded early last january the threat to americans 
assigned to the region has receded to the point that it is 
difficult to justify danger payments 
and the fact that we went to a different regime one of 
monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers 
directly changed things too observed one source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the central command is the organization responsible for american 
military operations in the middle east and indian ocean region as 
such it is the parent command for the joint task force middle east 
the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships 
flying the us flag in the persian gulf 
the administration of former president ronald reagan agreed in 
the spring of 1987 to extend american military protection to 11 
kuwaiti tankers after they reregistered under the stars and 
stripes kuwait a friend of the united states and a key ally of 
iraq had seen its ships become a special target of iranian forces 
in august 1987 one month after the first kuwaiti tanker to be 
escorted ran into an underwater mine the pentagon announced it 
would start making the payments to the crews of warships operating 
inside the persian gulf the strait of hormuz and a small portion of 
the gulf of oman as well as personnel in kuwait and bahrain 
iran and iraq agreed to a truce last august in their bloody 
8yearold war and to date the ceasefire has held as a result 
the united states has slowly reduced the number of warships 
operating in the region and stopped conducting closely supervised 
convoy runs 
instead the ships now in the region maintain what the navy calls 
a monitoring regime of keeping usflag tankers within radar or 
radio range 
the authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to 
the pentagon in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously 
established procedures for providing hostile fire or combat pay 
the new law specified that danger pay could be provided to 
servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or 
other physical threats even though american forces were not 
directly involved in combat 
after april 1 only a small number of servicemen assigned to four 
countries lebanon el salvador colombia and peru will be 
receiving the danger bonuses

the state department said monday it is prepared 
to support the salvadoran government that emerges from sundays 
national election but only so long as it respects democracy and 
protects human rights 
department spokesman charles redman praised the salvadoran people 
for having braved violence and terror by leftist guerrillas who 
he said tried harder to disrupt sundays balloting than in any 
other election in seven years 
our position is that we support the democratic process that we 
are prepared to support the person who emerges from that democratic 
process redman said 
our relationship with that new government will dependon its 
adherence to democracy and respect for human rights the twin 
pillars of our approach to el salvador 
redman spoke hours before the candidate of the ruling christian 
democratic party fidel chavez mena conceded defeat to alfredo 
cristiani nominee of the rightist arena party 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
judgments about human rights will be a very important factor in 
guiding us policy toward el salvador 
vice president dan quayle also criticized fmln guerrilla attempts 
to disrupt the voting asked by reporters about the deaths of two 
salvadoran and one dutch journalist sunday at the hands of security 
forces quayle said he lacked details 
but what ought to be disturbing to the american people and i 
know its disturbing to the people of el salvador is the fact that 
the fmln threatened the people of el salvador with their lives for 
exercising the democratic right to vote that is a very disturbing 
shocking event and we ouht to be shocked about that quayle said 
after an awards ceremony 
two members of a us delegation sent by president bush to 
observe the election sen mitch mcconnell rky and rep tony 
coelho dcalif said the process appeared to be fair but the 
actions of the new government will decide whether us aid continues 
we concluded that it was a free and fair and honest election 
mcconnell said clearly the activities of the fmln had some impact 
on turnout in some areas of the country 
coelho said the delegation met with cristiani and told him that 
if they return to the death squads return to the killing of the 
early 80s they should not expect support from individuals in our 
legislature as well as our government 
but mcconnell cautioned against applying an unreasonable standard 
we had more murders in this city washington last year than 
they did in the occupied territories of the middle east were not 
in a very good position to be lecturing people about violence he 
said the standard we need to apply here is not to expect that no 
violence will occur in a country in which a war is going on but 
rather how incidents are handled 
meanwhile dozens of demonstrators were removed by police monday 
from a state department entrance as hundreds of others protesting 
us support for the salvadoran government chanted from across the 
street 
the demonstrators did not resist as they were dragged away from 
the diplomatic entrance barricades were then put up and employees 
were diverted to other entrances 
placards and chants accused the united states of supporting 
rightwing death squads 
redman said the government of outgoing president jose napoleon 
duarte was committed to democracy and to improving human rights 
performance 
we will look to the new salvadoran government to uphold the 
same standards and to press for improvement redman said 
the election took place amid growing restiveness in congress 
about american policy in el salvador partly because of the arena 
partys growing strength 
a key figure in the arena hierarchy is maj roberto daubuisson 
who was once described by a former us ambassador to el salvador 
robert white as a pathological killer in 1980 the carter 
administration stripped daubuisson of his us visa 
as administration and congressional sources see it continued 
legislative support for largescale aid for el salvador will depend 
in some measure on cristianis ability to demonstrate that he is 
more than a front man for daubuisson 
although returns are not final cristiani has claimed victory 
over the candidate of the ruling christian democratic party fidel 
chavez mena 
the united states has provided about 35 billion in economic and 
military assistance to el salvador during this decade making it the 
largest recipient of assistance in the hemisphere 
some in congress maintain that the united states has received 
little in return on its investment pointing out that 
politicallymotivated killings average about 20 a month and that 
efforts to negotiate an end to the strife have not succeeded 
the conflict now nearly 10 years old is estimated to have 
claimed about 70000 lives

government and opposition negotiators 
attacked a series of unresolved problems monday as talks on 
political and economic reform entered a crucial phase 
solidarity the banned independent union movement reported 
progress on amending a draft law on upcoming parliament elections 
that the government last week sent to parliament for discussion 
without consulting the opposition 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said the 
government agreed to an opposition proposal that each candidate have 
a representative on votecounting commissions that clause had been 
dropped from the government draft sent to parliament 
government negotiators also accepted an opposition demand that 
the draft clearly state the law would be valid only for the upcoming 
elections in june onyszkiewicz said 
he said other problems remain including a debate over the number 
of signatures needed to nominate a candidate but it is a fact 
that the government side is ready to assume a flexible stand on all 
those problems 
negotiators hope to wrap up talks at the working groups so that a 
plenary session can be held april 3 the talks began feb 6 
negotiators at a working group on trade union issues have reached 
agreement on most issues said opposition negotiator henryk wujec 
but he said the two sides had failed to agree on the future of 
workers who were fired for their participation in solidarity or 
their refusal to leave it when it was banned after the december 1981 
martial law crackdown 
solidarity wants a statement saying the fired workers have the 
right to return to their jobs included in the roundtable document 
on trade unions the government says it is prepared to issue an 
appeal to managers to allow the workers to return wujec said 
tens of thousands of workers were dismissed from their jobs after 
martial law wujec said 
we solidarity decided if this problem is not solved we 
wouldnt be able to sign the final document i think some solution 
must be found he said 
although disputes remain one senior solidarity supporter 
expressed optimism that the talks would end in agreement 
i am not that much of a pessimist to think that the round table 
will end with a crash jerzy turowicz editor of the respected 
catholic weekly tygodnik powszechny told reporters 
in another development the banned union rural solidarity 
concluded a twoday national congress by expressing reservations 
about the upcoming parliament elections and asking that its property 
confiscated under martial law be returned a spokesman said monday 
the meeting saturday and sunday in a warsaw church brought 
together more than 400 private farmers from around the country in 
the first congress of rural solidarity since it was declared illegal 
following the imposition of martial law 
negotiators at the roundtable talks have agreed in principle to 
grant legality again to rural solidarity solidarity and rural 
solidarity are separate groups but are allied on most issues 
rural solidarity spokesman jacek szymaderski said the union does 
not plan to boycott parliamentary elections now being negotiated 
between the opposition and the government despite the fact that 
the proposed electoral law is not democratic and the proposed date 
is premature 
szymanderski said rural solidarity can expect to gain the support 
of about a million private farmers when it is legalized

two senior police officers were 
killed monday while returning from a meeting with colleagues in the 
irish republic authorities said the ira claimed responsibility 
lawmakers from northern ireland said the slayings suggested a 
serious breach of security involving the regular consultations 
between the two police forces set up under the angloirish accord 
to coordinate action against terrorism 
irish prime minister charles haughey condemned the murders and 
pledged full cooperation in the investigation 
the south armagh brigade of the irish republican army sent a 
message to news media claiming responsibility and saying the 
movements of the victims had been monitored 
the deaths followed a series of retaliatory slayings by 
protestant and roman catholic extremists on sunday gunmen stormed 
a belfast home and killed a roman catholic man while he said his 
prayers with his wife 
a police spokesman said the names of the two dead officers were 
not released and said he had no firm information on how they were 
killed we assume they were shot he said on condition of 
anonymity 
press association britains domestic news agency identified the 
victims as chief superintendent harry breen and superintendent bob 
buchanan breen the police commander in the south armagh area was 
said to be the highestranking police officer killed in 20 years of 
sectarian violence in the province 
they were in an unmarked car without uniforms so their 
identity had to be through information supplied to the terrorists 
said the rev william mccrea a democratic unionist member of 
parliament 
the constabulary said the car was found near jonesborough just 
inside the british province of northern ireland the area was sealed 
off and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troops 
moved in 
northern ireland secretary tom king pledged that the security 
forces would take every possible step to combat the wave of 
retaliatory murders 
king the british cabinet minister responsible for northern 
ireland discussed the violence monday with deputy police chief 
michael mcatamney of the royal ulster constabulary 
what the ruc and all the security forces need at this time is 
the full support of the whole community in a total rejection of 
violence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against these 
evil groups he said afterwards 
david braniff 63 and a father of 13 was shot dead in his north 
belfast home sunday night neighbors said two gunmen burst into 
braniffs house and shot him at pointblank range they said he died 
with his rosary in his hands 
police appealed to the public to help find braniffs killers no 
group immediately claimed responsibility 
braniff a catholic was a bricklayer who had been a protestant 
before he married he had british flags tattooed on his arms and 
worked in protestant areas of belfast 
on friday catholic civil servant niall davies 42 was shot in 
his home apparently in retaliation for the ira killing the previous 
night of jackie irvine 49 a former commander of the protestant 
paramilitary ulster volunteer force 
the latest round of killings began feb 12 when catholic attorney 
patrick finucane was shot in his home the protestant underground 
ulster freedom fighters said they killed him because he was an ira 
officer his widow denied it 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the province with the catholic irish 
republic to the south while the protestant majority wants to remain 
under the british flag

toxic railroad accidents pose a growing threat 
to communities nationwide and federal regulators do too little to 
prevent them a private group contended monday 
more than 24000 people were evacuated as a result of 351 rail 
accidents involving toxic materials in 1987 according to citizen 
action a public interest group based in washington with chapters in 
25 states 
fortyone of 50 states had at least one accident the group said 
basing its findings on figures supplied by the federal railroad 
administration 
a spokeswoman for the federal agency defended enforcement 
efforts saying that more hazardous material is being transported by 
rail and yet figures on rail cars leaking such material show a 
decline from 1984 and 1985 
in 1987 the private group said illinois led the nation with 49 
rail accidents involving hazardous materials followed by texas with 
46 and louisiana and michigan with 15 each 
texas had the greatest number of railcars leaking toxic 
materials 29 or nearly onethird of the total in what the 
group considered the most accurate measure of accident severity 
pennsylvania led the country with 12360 people evacuated 
although the number of toxic rail accidents nationwide declined 
37 percent from 1986 citizen action said the severity of those 
accidents increased significantly with the number of railroad 
cars leaking toxic substances up 127 percent from 79 in 1986 to 89 
in 1987 
those numbers however are down from 109 railcars that released 
hazardous materials in 1985 and 100 in 1984 said the federal 
railroad administration 
most toxic rail accidents were concentrated in heavily populated 
states bordering the great lakes and the gulf coast states with 
heavy industry or oil and gas production citizen action said 
few communities are safe from the environmental contamination 
of these catastrophes on wheels said robert creamer spokesman 
for citizen action and executive director of the illinois public 
action council which conducted the study 
citizen action said 4 billion tons of hazardous materials are 
shipped annually involving 250000 shipments and 3000 carloads a 
day 
the group contended that although 53 percent of rail accidents 
involving hazardous materials stemmed from mechanical failures the 
federal railroad administration does not effectively enforce rail 
safety standards 
the greatest contributor to toxic rail accidents are unsafe 
track and roadbeds yet even when fra inspectors find a defect they 
do not assess a penalty they only notify the railroad of its 
noncompliance creamer said 
a spokeswoman for the agency said notifications come only in very 
minor cases and she said the agency in 1987 assessed hazardous 
materials penalities totaling 646750

investigators found no evidence of fire or 
incorrect wiring in the righthand engine of a british midland 
airways jetliner that crashed on jan 8 killing 47 people an 
interim report said monday 
the bulletin issued by the governments air accident 
investigation branch reached no conclusion about the cause of the 
crash and said much work remains to be done on the investigation 
the righthand engine was shut off and the lefthand engine on 
fire when the plane crashed early in the flight from london to 
belfast northern ireland the report said 
it confirmed passengers reports of a fire in the lefthand 
engine of the brandnew boeing 737 and said one fan blade had 
fractured 
in his first public comment since the accident pilot kevin hunt 
said both the first officer david mclelland and i agreed that 
the right engine was causing us the problem 
hunt still hospitalized said in a statement the crew had no 
indication of a fire in the left engine until less than a minute 
from crashing while trying to land at central englands east 
midlands airport 
the report quoted the flight crew as saying cockpit instruments 
confirmed their belief that they had resolved their onboard 
emergency by shutting off the right engine and that the left engine 
was operating normally 
the left engine lost power when the airplane was nearly 2 miles 
from the airport and 900 feet above ground and hunt told mclelland 
to restart the right engine the report said 
seventeen seconds later a bell rang warning of a fire in the 
left engine and 36 seconds after that the plane crashed without 
ever regaining power in the right engine 
michael bishop chairman of british midland said the airline was 
satisfied the report accurately relates the sequence of events so 
far as theyre known he said he did not expect a final report to 
be available until early next year

democratic mayoral candidate richard m daley 
picked up an endorsement monday from democratic national committee 
chairman ron brown who spurned the candidate of his close ally 
jesse jackson 
he is the democratic partys nominee and i am the national 
democratic partys chairman brown said rich daley stands for 
the future of chicago for reaching out to all democrats for 
building better schools safer streets and a stronger economy 
these values are at the heart of the democratic party he 
said and i heartily endorse them and him 
jackson who supported mayor eugene sawyer in his losing primary 
election bid against daley has since shifted support to a 
thirdparty candidate alderman timothy evans 
the victor of the april 4 election will serve the final two years 
of the fouryear term won by the late mayor harold washington in 
april 1987 he died in november 1987 
daley the son of former mayor richard j daley is white evans 
like jackson brown sawyer and washington is black 
jackson was pivotal in helping brown secure the democratic 
chairmanship but brown also worked hard to prove to moderates and 
conservatives that he would be independent of jackson and other 
party liberals 
the reverend knows im here im not here to pick a fight with 
rev jackson or any other democrats brown told reporters after 
joining daley for a breakfast with more than 100 black business and 
political leaders 
the rev jackson and i are friends i respect him i told him 
what i planned to do and he didnt try to persuade me otherwise 
brown said 
evans the nominee of the harold washington party attempted to 
take some of the glow off the morning meeting calling it the 
quickest trip a national party chairman has ever taken he waved 
hello and waved goodbye in a matter of a few hours 
it doesnt sound like a ringing endorsement of rich daley to 
me i dont put down ron brown he added i know hes between a 
rock and a hard place 
the most recent poll in the campaign done by wlstv showed 53 
percent of the respondents favoring daley to 36 percent for evans 5 
percent for vrdolyak and 6 percent undecided 
the results of the telephone poll of 700 registered voters taken 
march 11 through march 15 had an error margin of plus or minus 4

use of a linear accelerator to produce tritium 
for nuclear weapons appears to be a promising alternative to current 
energy department plans to build new production reactors according 
to a scientific report released monday 
the report prepared by scientists at the los alamos nm and 
brookhaven ny national laboratories urged consideration of an 
accelerator as a possible backup to building new reactors at the 
savannah river complex in south carolina and the idaho national 
engineering laboratory in idaho falls 
the report said construction of new reactors was the lowest 
technical risk approach to supplying the critical need for tritium 
however we believe it is prudent that doe pursue other 
technologies for tritium production to provide potential 
alternatives as a contingency for the future the report said 
one concept that appears to be particularly promising is the 
accelerator production of tritium 
ronald cochran acting head of the energy departments office of 
new production reactors told a special panel of the house armed 
services committee on monday that the department has yet to see the 
report 
we will review the report with great interest cochran said 
adding that department believes the accelerator proposal involves a 
level of risk too great at this time to make it an alternative 
to constructing the reactors 
the nations current supply of tritium is threatened by the 
crumbling conditions at the departments existing production 
reactors and weapons plants 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium a critical element in nuclear weapons that 
increases the power of warheads but decays rapidly 
the report said that an accelerator could be completed within 
eight to nine years on an aggressive schedule compared with at least 
10 years to finish a new production reactor 
an accelerator would cost about 23 billion including 600 
million for contingencies the report said the estimated cost of 
the new savannah river reactor has been pegged at about 32 
billion while the idaho reactor would cost about 36 billion

the next us move in the middle east will be a 
plea to the palestine liberation organization on wednesday to ease 
tensions on the israeliheld west bank and in gaza us officials 
said monday 
but prospects for success apparently are dim plo officials 
already have vowed not to relent in their 15month uprising while 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir told 1100 visiting foreign 
jews in jerusalem that he would not deal with the plo 
diplomatic sources said shamir would come to washington on april 
5 and meet with president bush on april 6 a us official said 
meanwhile that president hosni mubarak of egypt would be here april 
3 to 5 for similar meetings king hussein of jordan is expected 
later in the spring 
secretary of state james a baker iii told a house appropriations 
subcommittee last week he might urge israel to talk to the plo if 
negotiations could not be held with other palestinians 
baker also unveiled during a visit by israeli foreign minister 
moshe arens his hopes for reciprocal gestures by the plo and israel 
on the west bank and in gaza 
the idea would be for israel to relax its grip on the territories 
by reversing its detention of palestinians while the plo would try 
to moderate the protests that began in december 1987 since then 
403 arabs and 17 israelis have been killed 
charles e redman the state department spokesman announced on 
monday the sixth us session with the plo would be held in tunisia 
he said its purpose was instituting a dialogue with yasser 
arafats organization 
without going into detail redman said the idea was to try to 
make some concrete progress in the peace process 
other us officials who declined to be identified said 
ambassador robert pelletreaus meeting with a plo representative on 
wednesday would provide an opportunity to seek reciprocal easing of 
tensions 
the us enovy has held five sessions in carthage since the 
reagan administration ended a 13year ban on dealing with the plo 
last december 
plo officials have complained the meetings were not substantive 
israel on the other hand criticized the united states for 
accepting a pledge by arafat renouncing terrorism 
since then pl0 guerrillas have conducted several raids against 
israelis in southern lebanon baker has concluded the attacks do not 
amount to terrorism requiring the talks to be broken off 
shamir in a speech in jerusalem said we fully recognize that 
the status quo is not in our interest because it means absence of 
peace and peace is our paramount goal 
at the same time shamir reiterated israels reasons for refusing 
to talk to the plo or to withdraw from the west bank and gaza which 
were lost by jordan and egypt in the 1967 sixday war 
the government is united in its opposition to the creation of a 
palestinian arab state west of the jordan river we are opposed to 
negotiations with the plo because it will inevitably lead to a

members of congress asked the commerce 
department on monday to explain why testing of westernmade 
highdefinition television equipment in the soviet union wouldnt 
violate laws prohibiting the transfer of advanced technology to the 
soviet bloc 
reps edward j markey dmass and don ritter rpa said in a 
letter to commerce undersecretary paul freedenberg they were 
concerned about affording the soviet union access to advanced 
television cameras displays video recorders and signal processing 
technology that could result in the transfer to the soviet union 
of sensitive technology that has potential for both military and 
commercial applications 
the soviet union has offered to conduct the first sidebyside 
tests of competing hdtv technologies being developed in japan the 
united states and europe the soviets say the tests would be an 
objective assessment of the differing systems and could speed 
development of a single system for worldwide use 
at hearings earlier this month before the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance which is 
chaired by markey questions were raised about possible violations 
of exportcontrol accords 
hdtv which promises motionpicture quality images has a number 
of potential uses including entertainment medicine education and 
the military 
the commerce department has jurisdiction over cocom the 
coordinating committee on multilateral export control which is an 
international watchdog agency regulating the flow of hightechnology 
products from western nations to the communist bloc 
markey and ritter asked freedenberg to report back within 30 days 
on whether advanced television technologies are subject to the cocom 
restrictions and if they had been approved for transfer to the 
soviet bloc 
their letter asked freedenberg to spell out what actions the 
commerce department and other federal departments agencies or 
entities presently are taking or prospectively will take to ensure 
that hdtv or advanced television technologies if they are 
prohibited technologies are not transferred to the soviet union or 
other eastern bloc nations by domestic or foreign entities 
they also asked freedenberg to outline how commerce determines 
what is prohibited by cocom and how the united states monitors 
adherence to the accords by other nations 
ken robinson a policy adviser in the commerce departments 
national telecommunications and information administration said 
agency officials could not comment on the letter until they had seen 
it 
but he noted that commerce secretary robert mosbacher during a 
recent appearance before the subcommittee said he was not in 
favor of exporting potentially strategic sensitive technology to the 
eastern bloc 
mosbacher also told the subcommittee his department had not 
agreed to any such transfers robinson said

pan american world airways has yet to implement 
many steps recommended by a security consultant who in 1986 warned 
that the airline was doing little to prevent bombs from being 
smuggled onto aircraft a congresswoman said monday 
according to rep cardiss collins dill the israeli security 
firm kpi inc cautioned the carrier more than two years ago that it 
was highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks 
the fact that no major disaster has occurred to date is merely 
providential kpi wrote in september 1986 mrs collins said 
last dec 21 pan ams flight 103 was blown from the skies over 
scotland by a bomb authorities say was placed in a radiocassette 
player killing 270 people 
mrs collins chairwoman of the goverment operations 
transportation subcommittee wrote a letter to the federal aviation 
administration on monday quoting portions of reports the security 
company wrote to pan am in september and november of 1986 
mrs collins wrote that within days of the completion of the 
september 1986 paper a terrorist attack in karachi pakistan 
killed 18 pan am passengers and crew members 
the studies included examinations of security at nine airports 
including frankfurt west germany and londons heathrow airport 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt and had landed in london 
mrs collins letter said that according to information her panel 
has gathered from a variety of sources pan am has yet to 
correct many of the gaps specified in the 1986 studies 
if they had been it is possible that those lives could have 
been saved she wrote referring to the scotland and pakistan 
disasters 
jeffrey kriendler pan ams corporate communications vice 
president at the airlines new york headquarters said kpi is 
unfamiliar with pan ams current security program he said the 
company would not respond to collins criticism until corporate 
officials had seen the letter 
the kpi reports concluded that pan am conducted insufficient 
checks of baggage did a poor job of questioning passengers boarding 
planes and was slow to react to warnings of possible terrorist 
activity according to mrs collins 
in conclusion there are no adequate safeguards under the 
presently operating security system that would prevent a passenger 
from boarding a plane with explosives on his person or in his 
baggage whether or not he is aware of the fact the security 
company wrote 
the reports said xray examinations of luggage should be replaced 
with manual searches which were performed too infrequently 
on the whole the presently employed search techniques stand a 
low chance of discovering concealed explosive charges if at all 
the consultant wrote 
the company wrote that careful scrutiny of lostandfound baggage 
is very rare making it simple for explosives to be sent 
ownerless to a supposed destination 
at some airports including london baggage with a pan am tag 
simply placed on a conveyer belt would be loaded onto planes even 
without a registered passenger kpi said 
the consultant criticized airline employees for being too lax 
when searching the baggage of americans and of citizens of each 
airports country considering them safer 
it might be pointed out that the question of citizenship is 
irrelevant to the terrorist threat kpi said 
the consultant said it found little effort to carefully 
scrutinize suspiciouslooking passengers 
it also complained that in some instances warnings of terrorist 
plans were not relayed to all pan am security workers in one 
incident all pan am security employees at frankfurt and paris were 
not told of a warning received about two middle eastern women who 
were planning to place explosives aboard a plane the report did not 
say what the consequences were

michelangelo would have run afoul of massachusetts 
law if he tried to sell his painting of the sistine chapel as an 
original an attorney challenging the states new schlock art 
law claimed monday 
the statute as it is written defines original as requiring 
only one person to work on it and michelangelo had apprentices that 
helped him out said attorney alvin nathanson 
nathanson represents united oil paintings inc which sells oil 
paintings for 35 to 200 in seaside art galleries and shopping 
malls up and down the eastern seaboard the company sued 
massachusetts saying the state law the first of its sort in the 
nation is vague and unconstitutional 
the law bans the sale of nonoriginal art unless it is 
labeled not an original it defines original as independently 
created and executed and signed by the individual artist a 
standard nathanson insists many old masters could not meet 
after a threeday trial last week both sides are now waiting for 
suffolk superior court judge john cratsley to decide what separates 
original art from schlock cratsley is not expected to rule until 
next month at the earliest 
the state legislator who wrote the law said he only intended to 
keep consumers from being sold cheap copies under the guise of 
original art 
state sen robert buell said schlock art companies put names 
similar to those of famous artists on paintings that are very 
similar to the wellknown works while such paintings stop short of 
forgery buell said they are certainly not original 
theres nothing wrong with selling it said buell who 
sponsored the law on behalf of artists in the seaside resort of 
rockport its just deceitful to tell the customer whos paying 
45 or 65 that hes getting an original painting 
united oil in a broad attack on the law has asked the court not 
only to define original but also to explain how police officers 
charged with enforcing the law could be expected to make such 
distinctions 
douglas h wilkins the assistant attorney general defending the 
state has argued that the point is moot since united oil has never 
been prosecuted though it has sold more than 60000 paintings since 
the law was passed 
wilkins also has argued that the law is constitutional because it 
protects consumers against deceptive marketing 
he told the judge it could be used to prosecute those who copy 
others work make machine reproductions and sell them as original 
oil paintings or sign false names to paintings 
wilkins dismissed the michelangelo example saying any law could 
be challenged in the abstract using farfetched examples 
how are they going to sell the sistine chapel anyway he 
said is it like selling the brooklyn bridge

the boss of a gang battling japans top underworld 
syndicate told police his gang will disband ending the bloodiest 
gangster vendetta in postwar japanese history police said monday 
hiroshi yamamoto 64 visited a police station near his home 
sunday afternoon to announce his decision to disband the ichiwakai 
gang said police in kobe a major port city in western japan 
he came here told us the gang was disbanding and left it all 
took about three minutes the officer at higashinada precinct 
said 
it is not uncommon for gangsters to make such appearances at 
police stations and many bosses even make written vows to police to 
end conflicts or disband gangs said the officer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but he said police are still waiting for a reaction from the 
rival yamaguchigumi by far the nations largest crime syndicate 
and further skirmishes could erupt 
the ichiwakai which had an estimated 6000 members at its peak 
was created in june 1984 after an internal dispute over 
yamaguchigumis leadership led to a revolt by followers of 
bosscandidate yamamoto 
in january 1985 two ichiwakai gangsters fatally shot 
yamaguchigumi boss masahisa takenaka and two other syndicate 
leaders 
the osaka high court on monday upheld a lower court verdict 
sentencing the two to life imprisonment and also upheld sentences of 
10 years for three ichiwakai lookouts 
the ichiwakai attack left the yamaguchigumi without a leader 
although acting boss kazuo nakanishi and young leader yoshinori 
watanabe quickly led the gang into the bloody vendetta known to the 
japanese as the yamaichi war 
police say 315 armed incidents during the fouryear battle 
between the two gangs left 25 people dead and more than 70 injured 
a yamaguchigumi source said yamamoto timed the breakup of the 
gang to match the sentencing as a kind of gesture to the 
yamaguchigumi he spoke on condition of anonymity 
in japan where gun laws are strict and violent crime rates low 
the highprofile gunfights created public outrage and spawned 
grassroots movements to rid residential areas of gang headquarters 
and offices 
the strongest of those movements evicted a yamaguchigumi 
affiliate from a residential area in hamamatsu central japan and 
the gang today is on the verge of disbanding 
headquarters of both the yamaguchigumi and the ichiwakai are in 
expensive residential districts in kobe but their presence has not 
faced serious local opposition 
when the ichiwakai split from the yamaguchigumi the 
organization had roughly 10000 members police say it now has more 
than 20000 
police say about 86000 gangsters operate in 3200 gangs in 
japan nearly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide 
syndicates the yamaguchigumi sumiyoshi rengokai and inagawakai 
the latter two are based in tokyo

egyptians and israelis discussing their 
countries relations after a decade of peace agreed monday that 
solving the palestinian problem is the only way to foster true 
friendship between the former enemies 
an israeli cabinet minister and two egyptians all major players 
in development of the peace treaty signed march 26 1979 urged the 
jewish state to recognize the palestine liberation organization as a 
first step toward peace across the region 
they and a group of students journalists and others met for a 
discussion organized by the british broadcasting corp and taped for 
broadcast tuesday five days before the anniversary of the first and 
only treaty between an arab state and israel 
let us make a difference between the two aspects of the 
treaty the first was peace between egypt and israel the second 
was the solution of the palestinian problem said butros ghali 
egypts minister of state for foreign affairs 
we have been successful in achieving the first we have 
completely failed in achieving the second one 
ghali was deeply involved in negotiations over the 1978 
usbrokered camp david accords which set a framework for the 
treaty and over the treaty itself 
we decided in camp david on a very important issue that we are 
going to solve the palestinian problem said ezer weizman 
israels minister of science and development and another key player 
in the process this is the next issue coming up and i believe 
that to continue what we started we have to do that 
ghali agreed and added sooner or later you will talk to the 
plo 
israel considers the plo a terrorist group and a succession of 
israeli governments has vowed never to negotiate with it 
weizman a leading member of the leftleaning labor party 
reiterated his wellknown position that israel should negotiate with 
the plo and predicted that talks could begin within two years 
mondays third main participant mustafa khalil was a senior 
aide to the late president anwar sadat whose 1977 trip to jerusalem 
led to peace between the two countries 
despite diplomatic relations egyptianisraeli cooperation in 
most fields has been very limited large numbers of israeli tourists 
come to egypt but few egyptians go to israel 
several egyptian participants at mondays session indicated the 
extent to which bad blood remains from four arabisraeli wars since 
1948 
khaled daoud a student at the american university in cairo said 
he had come to the session to discuss egypts relations with israel 
but i did not know there would be israelis here before i came if 
i had known personally i would not have come

the justice departments withholding of 
documents about the toxicwaste cleanup superfund arguably had the 
purpose or the effect of obstructing a 1983 congressional inquiry 
an independent counsel said monday 
but alexia morrison also concluded there was a lack of evidence 
that the subject of her criminal investigation former assistant 
attorney general theodore b olson was part of any conspiracy to 
withhold documents in the matter 
olson made misleading and disingenuous statements during a 
march 10 1983 appearance before a house subcommittee but there is 
insufficient evidence that he knowingly testified falsely 
morrison concluded in a 225page report 
olsons answers were not overly helpful but it clearly 
cannot be said in our view that the testimony actually obstructed 
the committees inquiry 
morrison had announced last aug 26 that she would not seek an 
indictment aganst olson 
her report detailing the reasons was released by a special 
court that appointed ms morrison independent counsel to investigate 
allegations that olso gave false testimony to obstruct the inquiry 
of the house judiciary monopolies subcommittee 
the panel was investigating allegations that the justice 
department concocted an executive privilege claim to prevent 
congress from obtaining environmental protection agency documents 
concerning possible misconduct by superfund officials 
the confrontation between congress and the executive branch 
helped bring the ouster of epa administrator anne m burford and 
other top officials including superfund director rita lavelle 
lavelle was later convicted of lying to congress about conflicts 
of interest in her management of the epas superfund program 
morrison who unsuccessfully sought to broaden her investigation 
to consider conspiracy charges against two other former top justice 
department officials suggested in her report that there was a basis 
for suspecting a concerted effort to thwart the subcommittees 
inquiry 
the principal act which arguable had the purpose or the effect 
of obstructing that inquiry was the failure to disclose to the 
committee the existence of documents which the department had 
withheld from its production to the committee morrison said we 
could find no evidence linking mr olson to that failure 
morrison noted that thendeputy attorney general edward c 
schmults withheld handwritten notes of department officials from the 
documents turned over to the subcommittee 
carol e dinkins then assistant attorney general in charge of 
the lands and natural resources division also withheld a draft 
chronology of the executive privilege dispute compiled within the 
department 
the subcomittee was not told that these documents were being 
withheld and was led to believe that virtually everything covered by 
its request was turned over morrison said 
the concealment of the notes and chronology arguably 
obstructed and certainly substantially delayed the successful 
completion of the committees inquiry morrison said 
and there were enough people involved in this course of conduct 
to give rise to the question whether they acted in concert to 
obstruct the committees inquiry 
for this reason morrison said that in late 1986 she asked 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii to expand her jurisdiction to 
pursue conspiracy allegations against schmults and dinkins 
on the advice of the criminal division meese refused to expand 
morrisons mandate and opposed her request to the special court for 
permission to broaden the investigation the special division of the 
us circuit court of appeals here ruled that it couldnt overrule 
meese but said morrison could investigate whether olson participated 
in a conspiracy 
in her report morrison said the withheld materials were 
plainly within the compass of the panels request and they 
contained information critical to any assessment of the departments 
role in the epa documents controversy 
even though there may have been a valid basis for withholding the 
material there could not be in our view any justification for the 
failure to inform the committee of the existence of the withheld 
documents morrison said 
in a statement attached to the report schmults now general 
counsel of gte corp in stamford conn pointed to a 1986 justice 
department memo concluding that there are no reasonable grounds to 
believe that further investigation or prosecution is warranted 
with regard to him 
olsons attorneys in another statement said he was unaware of 
any evidence suggesting the existence of a department of justice 
conspiracy to obstruct the house judiciary review process indeed 
he views the very concept of a possible conspiracy as preposterous 
the totality of this evidence demonstrates conclusively that 
mr olsons conduct throughout the judiciary committee process was 
wholly inconsistent with the notion that he participated in a scheme 
to obstruct congress by secretly withholding documentary 
materials olsons attorneys said

the army on monday barred 
journalists from the border region where nicaraguan rebel camps are 
located after two soldiers were killed by mines in the area 
the soldiers were patrolling on foot near the town of la 
congolona 100 miles southeast of tegucigalpa when they stepped on 
the mines thursday according to armed forces spokesman col manuel 
suarez benavides 
military teams worked over the weekend to clear mines from a 
20squaremile area at the border he said 
the sandinista army has intensified the mining of different 
honduran border zones with nicaragua by making rapid incursions into 
our territory with what appears to be an attitude of provocation 
suarez benavides said 
to avoid acts that we would later regret the decision was made 
not to permit journalists to enter yamales the area is along the 
yamales river 102 miles east of tegucigalpa the road to yamales 
runs to within 200 yards of the border with nicaragua in some places 
contra rebels who have operated from camps in honduras since 
1981 also are known have planted mines when retreating across the 
border 
nicaraguan officials had no immediate comment the two countries 
regularly exchange accusations on border incidents 
also monday foreign ministry spokesman eugenio castro claramount 
said at least 14 hondurans are among the 1894 former nicaraguan 
national guardsmen released last week in nicaragua he said they 
will soon be returning to tegucigalpa 
the nicaraguan army reported 20 incidents of harassment from 
honduran troops across the border from teotecacinte near the 
yamales area this year no casualties were reported 
about 11000 contra rebels and their families retreated to base 
camps in honduras after the united states cut off military aid about 
a year ago they have been receiving food medical supplies and 
other nonlethal us aid 
for many years access to the camps was strictly restricted by the 
honduran government but foreign journalists have been able to visit 
the camps frequently in recent months usually traveling there by 
road from tegucigalpa

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
88yearold patriarch said in a new year message monday that 
moslems must overcome carnal desires but admitted being unable to 
do so himself 
tehran television quoted him as saying i hope the iranian 
nation and other moslems throughout the world will transform 
themselves so they can work for the sake of god and not for their 
own victory or their carnal desires 
in his lifetime man is afflicted with carnal desires he needs 
selfdiscipline and i as the speaker of these words have not 
succeeded in this task 
the persian new year begins march 21 
president ali khamenei delivered a message stressing postwar 
reconstruction and development of oil and related industries a 
unsponsored truce was reached with iraq last august after eight 
years of war 
in the past year he said undoubtedly the most important event 
was the acceptance of the ceasefire by ayatollah khomeini and 
its support by the people 
chief justice musavi ardebili canceled new year vacations for 
judges and magistrates because of a government antinarcotics 
campaign tehran radio reported 
it quoted him as saying the vacations had been canceled so judges 
could continue stamping out malicious elements and drug 
smugglers

the african national congress vowed monday to 
step up its military and political resistance to south africas 
racial policies and it expressed support for the embattled winnie 
mandela 
after a fiveday conference of 88 leaders the main guerrilla 
group fighting the south african government also said it saw an end 
in sight to apartheid 
the apartheid regime is not only steeped in an irreversible 
crisis it is weakening in many ways secretarygeneral alfred nzo 
told a news conference the end i think is in sight 
nzo also said the group had discussed the issue of mrs mandela 
and winnie should be given the opportunity to continue to be the 
symbol of our struggle 
mrs mandela wife of jailed black leader nelson mandela was 
sharply condemned last month when her personal bodyguards were 
implicated in the alleged abduction of four black youths and the 
death of one of them 
the anc dismissed as a bluff hints of nelson mandelas early 
release from jail it said an increasing number of political 
opponents had been imprisoned since a state of emergency was imposed 
in 1986 
the closeddoor conference the largest since 1986 was called 
to review the situation in southern africa and to discuss 
antiapartheid strategies which nzo said will remain unchanged 
the recent election of fw de klerk as leader of the ruling 
national party will not result in any significant change in policy 
his recent utterances about a dialogue have no substance said 
nzo who is based in lusaka zambia 
the situation in south africa remains unchanged in its main 
elements he said accordingly we must escalate both the mass 
political offensive and our armed actions 
thomas nkobi the anc treasurer general said military forces 
will soon begin moving out of angola under the terms of the southern 
africa peace accord but he would not say when or where they would 
go when they move the people of the world will know he said 
nzo said the anc does not seek to operate from namibia after the 
south africancontrolled country becomes independent 
the southwest africa peoples organization which has fought a 
guerrilla war in namibia against south africa since 1966 is widely 
expected to win elections scheduled for next november 
i have heard different reports in the past swapo said it will 
do nothing to stop the struggle against apartheid nzo said the 
anc has not asked to have bases in namibia 
he said the anc will open new missions in washington madrid 
tripoli caracas and elsewhere to press for continued international 
sanctions against pretorias white minority government 
the conference was sponsored by norways largest labor union lo 
with help from the foreign ministry

it might have been a warning or a prank but the 
gift someone left for reputed mobster john gotti in front of his 
little italy hangout on monday was not a workable bomb police said 
when bomb squad officers opened a plastic box they found on the 
step of the ravenite social club they at first described what they 
found inside as an explosive powder 
but further analysis disclosed the powder to be two pounds of 
salt and an ounce of gunpowder given such a small amount of powder 
plus faulty batteries and wiring it appears the device would not 
have detonated chief of detectives robert colangelo told 
reporters if it had he added it probably couldnt have done much 
damage 
asked to explain the incident he said we could assume its 
either a message to gotti that perhaps he is vulnerable or that his 
club is vulnerable it could have been a prank it could have been a 
lot of things 
a man telephoned the police departments organized crime bureau 
shortly after 5 am and said there is a gift for john gotti at 
the social club he did not give his name but identified the club 
as the ravenite in lower manhattan 
police inspector richard mayronne said the device included a 
10inch aluminum bottle packed with powder the bottle was partially 
contained in a 4by6 inch plastic box which contained batteries 
wired to a circuit board with an electric timer the bottle which 
contained the powder and a coil protruded from inside the box 
the nonbomb was the latest slap at gotti reputed boss of the 
gambino crime family who is besieged by law enforcers and mob 
rivals 
in january a battalion of police officers some of them posing as 
street vendors arrested gotti on the street near the ravenite they 
threw him against a wall patted him down and read him his rights 
gotti apparently stunned to be treated like a common criminal 
asked whats wrong with you guys 
he was charged with ordering the shooting of a union official who 
had himself ordered the trashing of a restaurant owned by a gambino 
family member 
meanwhile prosecutors in a mafia trial in newark say members of 
the genovese crime family headed by vincent chin gigante 
plotted to kill gotti to stop him from infringing on their rackets 
fbi agents in fact warned gotti in 1987 that he was the subject of 
such a murder plot gigante and gotti are virtually the only major 
new york mafia figures to have avoided long prison sentences 
the ravenite which has been the subject of intense surveillance 
by investigators is a simple storefront that sits inconspicuously 
on a street of colorful lively italian restaurants the club has 
long been frequented by members of the gambino crime family notably 
aniello dellacroce a professional murderer who became one of the 
familys two most powerful leaders 
dellacroce was gottis patron and after the older man died in 
1985 gotti allegedly ordered the murder of gambino boss paul 
castellano and seized control of the family

rep newt gingrich striving to prevent damage 
to his race for the no 2 leadership post among house republicans 
promised monday to provide full accounting of his unusual book 
promotion deal 
well check with our attorney and get it out into the open 
said the georgia congressman trying to distinguish his book deal 
from the one that led to ethics charges brought by gingrich against 
house speaker jim wright 
we were not trying to make a quick buck or arrange any 
sweetheart deal he said at a news conference although the 
limited partnership formed for promotion was unusual in publishing 
it was much like the arrangement used for producing and promoting 
a broadway play he said 
wright dtexas clearly reveled in the attention being paid to 
his nemesis 
people who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones he 
said 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said gingrich should 
expect to face an inquiry himself 
he should anticipate somebody filing charges and hell have 
to live by the same standard he has set for others coelho said 
gingrich made a plea to you and the press and the american 
public to listen and understand the truth he said but others 
asked for the same thing and newt wasnt always interested 
coelho said 
three house democrats reps barney frank of massachusetts 
martin sabo of minnesota and lawrence smith of florida sent a 
letter to gingrich late monday asking that he answer a list of 
questions they said are raised by the promotion deal 
the letter says the questions involve house rules financial 
disclosure requirements the federal election campaign act and the 
internal revenue service code 
an article in mondays washington post said 21 investors put up 
5000 apiece to promote gingrichs 1984 book window of 
opportunity in exchange the investors were to receive 45 percent 
of the profits but there werent any 
they did however gain tax benefits from the arrangement the 
article said 
gingrichs wife marianne who coauthored the book received 
less than 10000 from the 105000 for her work in arranging 
the deal and coordinating the promotional efforts her tax benefit 
amounted to 26 gingrich said 
she said the house ethics committee was consulted before the 
partnership contracts were signed and their earnings were fully 
disclosed as house rules require 
i did a lot of work she told reporters adding that the book 
was still for sale and reciting a tollfree number if anybody wanted 
to buy 
contrasting his volume with the one wright has privately 
published and sold gingrich said his book was a real book 272 
pages long with real ideas not a collection of house floor 
speeches and memories and it was sold in regular bookstores 
gingrich said he held the news conference as soon as he could 
because he wanted to quickly dispel any notion of wrongdoing in the 
midst of his campaign for minority whip 
gingrich is one of two announced candidates for the post which 
became vacant when dick cheney was confirmed last week as secretary 
of defense rep edward madigan rill is also campaigning for the 
position 
gingrich said monday he believes he has a majority of the 174 
house republicans committed to him and that the article about his 
book deal would not hurt except that it was a distraction for a few 
hours 
meantime the house ethics committee convened for its first full 
day of deliberations in wrights case following three weeks of 
presentations and counterarguments from its special counsel and 
wrights attorney 
chairman julian dixon dcalif said the deliberations would go 
through wednesday but added he could not predict whether final 
decisions on the charges against wright would be completed by then 
if not the panel would reconvene early next month following the 
easter recess he said 
rep john t myers of indiana the senior republican on the 
panel said he expects the panel will act to release the full report 
of its independent counsel richard phelan but added that decision 
had not yet been made 
both men said they expected that whatever the final outcome it 
would be bipartisan and not be the result of a polarized committee 
the 12member panel unique in the house is evenly divided between 
democrats and republicans 
both also said they did not expect the gop leadership race to 
impact their deliberations and myers said he did not believe 
gingrichs book promotion deal would be relevant 
theyre two separate issues he said that is not an issue 
before the ethics committee and hopefully it will not be later 
asked about the impact of the book deal on gingrichs chances myers 
added i dont see how they can help any mr gingrich it poses 
i think some problems for him 
abctv reported monday night that wright was a silent partner 
with a major savings and loan operator in a florida land development 
deal at the same time wright was involved in legislation affecting 
the savings and loan industry 
the deal involved a 20acre parcel of land near orlando fla 
according to abc the land was subdivided into housing lots and 
wright tripled his money in three years making a 90000 profit 
abc said one of the other buyers was richard swann an orlando 
lawyer who was chairman of the citys largest savings and loan the 
network said 
mark johnson a spokesman for wright the abc story was utterly 
false there was not even the slightest potential for a conflict of 
interest as abc suggested the whole underlying premise of that 
story is that there some connection to the sampl issue and its just 
utterly and totally false

a judges lastminute intervention kept randall 
dale adams in prison monday as he was about to walk free after 
serving 12 years in prison on a controversial conviction for the 
killing of a police officer 
district judge ron chapman reset adams bond at 100000 
superseding another judges decision to release adams simply on a 
promise to appear in court 
the action which culminated an afternoon of confusion among 
prosecutors judges and defense attorneys came after the district 
attorneys office filed a motion to have state district judge larry 
baraka removed from the case 
in another late development prosecutors said for the first time 
that they were prepared to retry adams since his conviction was 
overturned after being questioned in the film the thin blue line 
we are ready for a trial right now said assistant district 
attorney winfield scott we could call and crank up this trial 
right now if you wanted us to were fully prepared to proceed with 
the trial 
prior to scotts comments it was unknown whether prosecutors 
felt they had enough evidence to seek a new trail 
vances office in filing the motion to have baraka removed 
charged that the judge was biased when he ruled there was not enough 
evidence in the original 1977 case to convict adams 
judge chapman said 54th district judge carl anderson would hear 
the motion tuesday afternoon if the judge rules that baraka should 
not be removed from the case adams could be released under the 
50000 personal recognizance bond that baraka set for him earlier 
monday 
but chapman said once the motion to recuse is filed judge 
baraka has no other authority to do anything further on the case 
chapman and baraka are both state judges but chapman presides as 
administrative judge for the region 
defense attorney randy schaffer said adams did not have the 10 
percent necessary to post bail on the 100000 bond adams remained 
held in the lew sterrett justice center monday night 
i guarantee its not tonight and i dont know when if ever 
schaffer said on whether adams would be able to post bail 
district attorney john vance said i dont think randall dale 
adams ought to be out on the street i think anybody thats indicted 
for killing a police officer is a danger to society 
adams 40 has steadfastly maintained his innocence in the 1976 
shooting death of dallas police officer robert wood he originally 
was sentenced to death but his sentence was commuted to life in 
prison in 1980 
his conviction was unanimously overturned by the texas court of 
criminal appeals on march 1 
the appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of 
baraka and agreed with his ruling that adams did not receive a fair 
trial 
adams case had been resurrected with the help of new york 
filmmaker errol morris whose documentary the thin blue line 
suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecutions chief 
witness david harris 
harris who is on death row for another slaying was not charged 
in the wood shooting he testified at adams 1977 trial that adams 
was driving a car that the police officer pulled over and that 
adams shot the officer 
however in a hearing before baraka last december harris 
testified that adams did not kill wood 
schaffer also presented evidence at the december hearing that 
prosecutors had suppressed evidence at adams trial 
the district attorneys office earlier monday filed a motion 
asking that adams bond hearing be presented before a different 
judge baraka rejected the motion 
there are no lengths they will not go to to pursue this man 
schaffer said prosecutors were not present in court much to the 
annoyance of schaffer 
ive been to three goat ropings and a county fair and ive 
never seen this kind of childish behavior schaffer said 
before chapmans decision schaffer had said adams planned to 
join his family in ohio and morris the filmmaker called barakas 
release order a wonderful step toward exoneration

manager faces possible suspension for gambling

statement did not say what the allegations were rose admits to a 
fondness for betting on horse and dog races but has never been 
accused of betting on baseball 
the usually effusive rose declined comment on the investigation 
if something happens when it happens ill talk about it then 
he said 
the commissioners statement was issued jointly with a bartlett 
giamatti the national league president who has been selected to 
replace ueberroth 
the office of the commissioner which was founded to preserve 
the integrity of the game has for several months been conducting a 
full inquiry into serious allegations involving mr pete rose the 
statement said

commissioner will consider the information presented and take 
whatever action is warranted by the facts consistent with the rules 
and procedures of major league baseball it continued 
rose flew to new york from spring training on feb 20 to meet 
with ueberroth giamatti and several lawyers at the time the 
commissioners office said the matter was private but several 
published reports said gambling was discussed 
not until monday did baseball acknowledge it was investigating 
rose and one baseball source who asked not to be identified said 
that the statement was a prelude to whats going to happen in the 
next couple of days he said rose might be suspended for gambling 
activities

task force from 1972 to 1978 and led investigations of the fbi and 
of former pennsylvania rep dan flood dowd said monday that he had 
been investigating rose for about a month and did not know how much 
longer the inquiry would last 
he would not discuss the nature of the investigation

umpire dave pallone it was the longest suspension given a manager

alfredo cristiani who tried to 
erase memories of his rightwing partys links to death squads that 
killed thousands of salvadorans celebrated his presidential victory 
monday over the usbacked government 
fidel chavez mena candidate of the incumbent christian 
democrats conceded defeat and told a news conference i have 
called him cristiani personally to congratulate him and express my 
desire that god illuminate him in governing the country 
us ambassador william walker said the election result was not a 
defeat for us policy in washington the state department said it 
was prepared to support the new salvadoran government but only if it 
protects democracy and human rights 
cristiani of the republican nationalist alliance or arena will 
take over from president jose napoleon duarte on june 1 duarte one 
of washingtons staunchest allies had been unable to end a 
9yearold civil war with leftist rebels that has taken an estimated 
70000 lives 
duarte barred by the constitution from seeking reelection has 
said his proudest moment will come when he hands over power to an 
elected successor duarte suffers from terminal liver cancer 
cristiani immediately urged all political parties to put down 
their political banners and unite to ensure progress he told a 
monday news conference that his party doesnt want a sectarian 
government 
he also thanked chavez mena for accepting in a very democratic 
manner the results of the elections 
the central elections council said arena had 5381 percent of the 
576339 votes counted from sundays election compared to 3659 
percent for the centrist christian democrats trailing were the 
conservative national conciliation party with 421 percent and the 
leftist democratic convergence at 32 percent other votes were 
divided among three smaller parties 
arena has won and i congratulate alfredo cristiani publicly 
said ricardo perdomo the christian democratic chairman of the 
council he said final official results would not be announced until 
a recount is concluded thursday 
agriculture minister antonio morales erlich estimated voter 
turnout at between 850000 and 900000 one of the lowest in 
salvadoran history and less than half of those eligible walker the 
us ambassador had said a turnout of 60 percent or better would 
represent a defeat for the guerrilla strategy 
chavez mena conceded that cristiani would win more than 50 
percent of the vote thus enabling him to evade a runoff election 
that would have been held next month between the top two contendes 
state department spokesman charles redman said our 
relationship with that new government will depend on its adherence 
to democracy and respect for human rights the twin pillars of our 
approach to el salvador said department spokesman charles redman 
redman praised the salvadoran people for braving violence and 
terror by leftist guerrillas who he said tried harder to disrupt 
sundays balloting than any other election here in seven years 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the elections 
represent a strong desire by the people of el salvador for the 
ability to participate in the election process but he said the 
united states was concerned about the level of guerrilla attacks 
and human rights abuses during the balloting 
the united states has supported el salvador with 35 billion in 
aid this decade and some congressmen have said the results leave 
much to be desired 
cristiani a 41yearold coffeegrower and businessman said late 
sunday he would be the president of all 5 million salvadorans we 
are going to unify this people in order to pull ourselves out of 
this profound crisis 
arena was linked in the early 1980s to rightist death squads 
blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected leftists 
cristiani contends the party has changed significantly and his 
candidacy was evidence of that 
but fanatical rightists remain prominent in the party including 
party founder roberto daubuisson who was once called a 
pathological killer by a us ambassador daubuisson has 
repeatedly denied links to death squads 
daubuisson a former army major who was cashiered in 1980 for 
allegedly plotting a coup is an arena legislator although he holds 
no formal party post he was the partys top drawing card at 
election rallies where he was introduced as maximum leader 
the election marked the first time salvadoran voters had a chance 
to replace an incumbent civilian government with a distinctly 
different government 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front tried 
to thwart the voting with a transport ban across the 
massachusettssized country and attacks on military positions in 12 
of the countrys 14 provinces 
the insurgents lifted the ban monday and said that the high 
absentee rate proved their contention that el salvadors problems 
could not be solved without their participation 
at least 29 guerrillas and soldiers were killed in sundays 
fighting as well as two civilians according to col emilio ponce 
chief of the joint chiefs of staff ponce told the associated press 
the attacks constituted a nationwide offensive 
three journalists two salvadorans and a dutchman also were 
killed and a fourth seriously wounded by security forces over 
election weekend

municipal judge david horwitz presiding at the preliminary 
hearing determined there was enough evidence to try bridges and set 
the 23yearold former actors superior court arraignment for friday 
the judge rejected a plea from bridges attorney to reduce the 
charge on grounds that bridges was too drugged to form the intent to 
shoot his alleged victim 
the defendant is grossly overcharged said attorney johnnie 
cochran who noted that witnesses said bridges ingested rock cocaine 
at least four times the day of the shooting at a house that was a 
cocaine hangout

23yearold bridges as based out from freebasing smoking 
cocaine when the shooting occurred feb 2 
it was the worst i seen him said clay 25 he looked like 
his eyes were about to jump out of his head hed lost a lot of 
weight just wasnt hisself 
clay described himself as a bodyguard at the house in 
southcentral los angeles where bridges was living he said he had 
seen bridges have apparent epileptic seizures after consuming large 
amounts of cocaine and once stuffed a towel in bridges mouth to 
keep him from swallowing his tongue 
on feb 2 clay said bridges came to the house and they argued 
he said bridges left and later returned with a gun and a friend 
harvey duckett when bridges fired the gun clay said duckett urged 
him on saying shoot him shoot him 
duckett who has a long record of felony convictions pleaded no 
contest to being an accessory in the case however he denied clays 
account and said he didnt arrive until the shooting was over 
authorities allege that bridges shot clay eight times the actor 
who appeared in jail garb monday has been unable to post 2 million 
bail horwitz refused a request from cochran to lower the bail

the transport department told airlines and airports 
monday there is a high and continuing risk of more devices like 
the bomb in a radiocassette player that destroyed pan am flight 
103 killing 270 people 
the department said it sent a telex as a reminder of its previous 
warnings which have been the subject of controversy and to suggest 
new safety measures transport officials would not elaborate on the 
statement 
pressure grew for the government to explain whether the flight 
103 disaster on dec 21 could have been averted with better 
dissemination of warnings and information about bombing equipment 
found before the explosion over lockerbie scotland 
opposition politicians have demanded transport secretary paul 
channon resign because of how he handled events before the bombing 
which killed all 259 people on the boeing 747 and 11 on the ground 
the evening standard newspaper said police believe the bomb 
contained only one or two pounds of explosives but its location 
near a weakened seam in the baggage hold increased its effect 
inspector tom mccullough of the lockerbie police who are 
conducting the investigation refused comment beyond saying the 
report was most likely speculation by the press 
a source the evening standard did not identify was quoted as 
saying if the bomb had been almost anywhere else it might have 
killed half a dozen people or maybe even just shredded some bags 
in washington a member of congress said pan am still is not 
following many antiterrorism measures an israeli security firm 
suggested to it more than two years ago 
rep cardiss collins dill said in a letter to the federal 
aviation administration the security consultant concluded the 
airline was not careful enough in checking baggage did a poor job 
of questioning passengers boarding planes and was slow in reacting 
to warnings of possible terrorist activity 
she quoted from reports kpi inc gave pan am in 1986 after 
reviewing pan am security at nine airports including frankfurt and 
londons heathrow airport flight 103 originated in frankfurt and 
changed planes at heathrow 
one of the kpi reports said pan am is highly vulnerable to 
most forms of terrorist attack the fact that no major disaster has 
occurred to date is merely providential 
opposition lawmakers in london continued claiming monday that the 
public was not given a full explanation of events before the 
bombing channon made no comment 
he canceled a speech to an airline magazine conference and did 
not address parliament after the second rejection of an opposition 
labor party request to force him to speak 
labor and other opposition leaders want channon to explain why a 
warning that might have alerted pan am to the type of bomb used was 
not sent until after the disaster 
it was the second of two issued after the discovery oct 26 by 
west germany of explosives hidden in a radiocassette player in the 
possession of suspect palestinians 
mondays statement by the transport department said since the 
discovery in germany in october last year of an explosive device 
hidden in a radio we have considered it possible that there might 
be other similar devices in existence in germany or elsewhere 
in view of the high and continuing risk for electronic devices 
the department has today by telex issued a further reminder to 
airports and airlines drawing attention to the guidance issued 
earlier and suggesting some further steps that should be taken 
the first warnings were issued in november but pan am says it did 
not receive the second more detailed bulletin until jan 17 
channons department said the fact that us airlines were not 
told until january a delay it said occurred because color 
photographs were being prepared was not important because the faa 
and west germany provided similar information a month earlier 
channon also has been criticized for failing to tell parliament 
of either warning until last week and failing to order tighter 
airport security 
roland bachmeier of the west german interior ministry said monday 
that british experts attended a briefing nov 15 on the 
radiocassette player found in west germany and they were in 
possession of all the information 
faa spokesman john leyden said in washington on monday that his 
agency did not send a photograph of the explosive device to airlines 
he said the faas nov 18 security alert to carriers contained 
technical details of the bomb and how it would work he said it 
wasnt until later that the west germans developed material on the 
bomb that included photographs 
us carriers serving london received the photograph from british 
authorities he said

top army and intelligence officials told the 
cabinet that israel must deal with the plo if it wants to reach a 
settlement with palestinians and end the uprising in the occupied 
territories news reports said monday 
the reports came as prime minister yitzhak shamir opened a 
conference of world jewish leaders with a call for solidarity and 
won a standing ovation for equating the plo to the biblical 
murderers of the jews 
the daily newspapers haaretz and yediot ahronot said authorized 
elements of appraisal believed to be military and intelligence 
officials concluded the palestine liberation organization has made 
substantive changes and wants a realistic political settlement 
that assessment was given to shamirs cabinet along with the 
judgment that no dialogue with the palestinians was possible without 
the plo the newspapers said 
according to the reports the intelligence sources said the 
palestinian uprising could continue for years and be kept at 
manageable levels by the military but it would not end without a 
political solution 
avi pazner a spokesman for shamir said the reports were 
inaccurate and misleading but would not comment further 
a succession of israeli governments have refused to deal with the 
plo which israel views as a terrorist group however some doves in 
the centerleft labor party have recently advocated talking to the 
plo as the only way to resolve the palestinian problem 
shamir made it clear at the conference he had not softened in his 
approach to the plo 
we have the power and determination to confront the hamans of 
this generation and to expose their deception their doubletalk 
and to rid the world of their venom and ideology once and for all 
shamir said 
haman plotted to exterminate the jews at the time of the persian 
king xerxes the book of esther says 
at times like this when our peoples desperate yearning for 
peace is questioned by some we want our sisters and brothers to 
come forward and explode this blasphemy shamir declared we may 
have our differences on how to achieve our dream of peace but we 
are united that peace is our goal 
in prepared remarks handed out earlier to reporters shamir said 
agreeing to a palestinian state in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip would not solve the problem 
our government is united in its opposition to the creation of a 
palestinian arab state west of the river jordan he said we are 
opposed to negotiations with the plo because it will inevitably lead 
to a demand for a state 
israel radio said some delegates rose at an earlier closed 
meeting to recommend negotiations with the plo 
president chaim herzog opened the conference of 1100 jewish 
leaders from 30 countries 
we dare not underestimate the feelings expressed in the unrest 
nor should we expect it to simply fade away he said of the 
palestinian uprising that began more than 15 months ago in which 
403 palestinians and israelis have been killed 
there is no way but peace no solution but through open free 
bilateral negotiations 
this requires emergence of a fearless sober palestinian 
leadership which will abandon negation of israels right to 
exist will abandon the path of violence and terror and will enter 
into negotiations without preconditions 
a call for talks with the plo by deputy finance minister yossi 
beilin an aide to labor leader shimon peres brought criticism from 
members of shamirs conservative likud bloc and predictions of an 
end to the laborlikud coalition 
peres also suggested the coalition partners might divide over the 
peace issue 
i think in the coming months we shall have to make up our 
mind he said on israel radio if we can find a joint solution 
fine if not we will have to make an historic choice 
in baghdad iraq plo chairman yasser arafat told a news 
conference israel government is using a plan to halt the uprising 
that consists of escalating oppressive measures and intensifying 
the ironfist polices against our people while offering some 
new ideas on a settlement to the conflict aimed at distracting 
world opinion 
he denied reports the united states asked the plo to halt 
military operations against israel as a condition of continuing a 
dialogue that began in december washington lifted a 13year ban on 
dealing with the plo after arafat publicly renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist 
arafat said the plo has the right to conduct all kinds of 
struggle against israel but indicated recent attacks were mounted 
by rival palestinian factions to embarrass him 
israeli forces repelled four guerrilla incursions last week 
including two from lebanon and one each from jordan and egypt five 
guerrillas and one israeli soldier were killed 
arafat said plo officials meeting in tunis on march 29 with us 
ambassador robert pelletreau will ask for active american 
involvement in efforts to convene an international peace conference 
on the middle east peace conference

a former methodist minister found financially 
liable for an attack that has left his wife comatose said he will 
honor a subpoena he was confronted with when he came to town to 
visit his children 
walker railey told kdfwtv in dallas on sunday that he has agreed 
to make his financial records available to the attorney who 
represents his wifes parents 
railey was served the subpoena saturday morning as he approached 
the home of a friend who has custody of his two children railey 
said he was in town from california to help his children celebrate 
their march birthdays 
no criminal charges have been filed in the april 21 1987 attack 
on peggy railey but in a civil suit filed by mrs raileys parents 
against railey a state district judge awarded nearly 18 million in 
a default judgment railey was served the suit twice but never 
responded to the allegation that he attacked his wife though he 
denied it out of court 
despite the judges ruling mrs raileys parents william and 
billie joe nicolai have yet to collect any money from railey 
bill arnold the attorney for the nicolais subpoenaed railey for 
questioning about his financial status last week 
this is just part of the process the judge found him liable 
for trying to kill his wife said arnold said this is just the 
next step in trying to find what assets he had it will never make 
peggy railey whole but its the only thing we have left to do 
railey said he didnt respond to the earlier subpoenas because 
i had nothing to gain in the suit and i didnt have the money to 
go to court 
railey has denied any knowledge of the attack that left his wife 
in a coma mrs railey is in a nursing home and doctors say she is 
not expected to recover 
railey has said he was working late the night of the attack and 
returned to find his wife near death but there were several 
inconsistencies in the information railey provided to police about 
his whereabouts on the night of the attack 
eight days after the attack he took an overdose of pills on the 
morning police wanted to question him he wrote a note saying he 
felt besieged by demons 
railey then pastor of the first united methodist church in 
dallas eventually surrendered his church credentials citing 
increasing stress from the attack and the investigation 
later he turned custody of his children over to friends and 
moved to california

missing after explosions and fires swept through the platforms 
sunday night 
thirtyfive men escaped the blazing platforms according to the 
coast guard ten of those were injured two critically 
the sidebyside oil production platforms which were connected 
by catwalks erupted in flames about 730 pm sunday the coast 
guard said men were working on natural gas lines at the time of the 
fires but a spokesman for owner atlantic richfield co said the 
cause was unknown monday 
there was work going on said company spokesman earl sims 
but we dont know if it was the cause 
sims had no assessment of loss and said he did not know how 
severely the two platforms were damaged 
arco identified five of its employees who were among the seven 
missing it said the other two were employees of contractors working 
aboard the rigs 
the missing arco workers were richard freeman jr of meadville 
miss james r gibbs of elba ala doyle henson jr of deridder 
la barry pritchard of lafayette la and jb suharto an 
indonesian on assignment with arco in lafayette the two contractors 
were not identified

sundown monday quartermaster 1st class fred kephart said the coast 
guard was deciding whether to resume searching tuesday morning 
sims said arco and other rig operators in the area would continue 
searching tuesday but at a reduced level with just two boats 
at their disposal 
sims said searchers boarded one of the platforms during the day 
but found no survivors or bodies 
the other platform the one where the fire started was much more 
badly damaged there is some question about the integrity of the 
structure and whether we can get on it in a safe manner said 
sims well be looking at that tomorrow 
the two platforms just off the southeast tip of louisiana were 
about 50 to 100 feet apart with living quarters on one 
coast guard petty officer bob morehead said 42 people were 
believed to be aboard the arco platforms when the fires broke out 
helicopters and boats rescued the survivors some of whom jumped 
directly into the water while others fled the platforms in covered 
capsulelike life boats 
morehead said an oil slick two miles long and about 100 yards 
wide extended from the structures 
the 10 injured men were taken to west jefferson hospital in 
marrero a new orleans suburb said spokeswoman lynne pourciau 
eight were suffering from burns and two others from multiple

a sting operation has dealt a body blow to a 
brisk methamphetamine trade by targeting alleged drug dealers who 
ranged from health care workers to gang members officials said 
monday 
this is the largest single enforcement operation directed 
against illicit drug manufacturers ever undertaken in the united 
states said agent charles hill of the us drug enforcement 
administration 
ninetyone people were charged in 27 separate federal 
indictments unsealed monday with manufacture and distribution of 
methamphetamine an illegal stimulant known as speed meth 
or crystal 
in addition 29 methamphetamine labs were seized state attorney 
general john van de kamp said 
philip donohue jr agent in charge of the local office of the 
state bureau of narcotic enforcement said 78 people were in custody 
and authorities had seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and at 
least 38 weapons including combat assault rifles and one uzi 
submachine gun 
the first arrests came sunday as 350 officers from several law 
enforcement agencies made sweeps of homes in san diego orange 
county and mammoth lakes in the sierra nevada more arrests were 
planned donohue said 
the sting involved the placement of an undercover state agent 
inside a legitimate retail chemical supplier triple neck scientific 
co of san diego with the owners consent 
starting last june the agent made contact with customers buying 
chemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine and other illegal 
drugs said van de kamp 
methamphetamine makers in san diego arent limited to the 
traditional subculture of outlaw motorcycle gangs the attorney 
general said 
only half those arrested in this operation fit that 
description among the other half we had people like a retired 
pharmacist and a registered nurse we found whole families 
involved in the drug trade he said 
this gigantic sting will deal a body blow to the 
methamphatamine trade in san diego van de kamp added 
donohue said san diego has the dubious distinction of being the 
meth capital of the united states 
nearly half of the illegal methamphetamine labs in the united 
states are located in california and san diego county has led the 
nation in the number of labs seized for each of the past five years 
according to federal figures

heidi holland has made the journey from 
offbroadway to broadway with her wit and wisdom intact in fact 
she has gotten better although shed be the first to deny it 
heidi is the insecure heroine of the heidi chronicles wendy 
wassersteins funny feminist travelogue that takes theatergoers from 
the late 1960s to the present the play now on view at broadways 
plymouth theater after a successful run at playwrights horizons 
remains one of the unqualified joys of the new york theater season 
in a series of sketches wasserstein traces heidis changing 
ideas about herself about men and about other women heidi an art 
historian may not embrace every trend notion or belief that pops 
up during her 20year odyssey but she examines them with a 
discerning attitude that is rich in humor and not above a little 
anger 
director daniel sullivan has enlarged the production for 
broadway but he hasnt diluted its effectiveness large slide 
projections that pinpoint specific historical moments from vietnam 
war protests to the first rumbles of womens as well as gay 
liberation enhance its appeal snippets of old pop music also help 
anchor the play in the particular time periods 
at the center of the play stands joan allens radiant performance 
as heidi she projects an intelligence and likability that never 
waver during the characters many moments of selfdoubt its a 
richly drawn portrait 
peter friedman has polished his performance as the egocentric 
babyboomer publisher who is in love with heidi but marries someone 
else hes arrogance at its most ingratiating boyd gaines is funny 
and at times poignant as a sardonic but caring baby doctor cynthia 
nixon the one new addition to the cast demonstrates her virtuosity 
in two roles as a flower child in a hilarious womens rap session 
and as an ambitious corporate groupie of the reagan years 
wasserstein has had some offbroadway successes most notably 
isnt it romantic and uncommon women and others the heidi 
chronicles is her broadway debut and its something to cheer

great britain but not the company of actors sent overseas by its 
educational division with a ragtag version of macbeth 
the production now on view at the harry dejur playhouse toured 
colleges and universities across the country before coming to new 
york for a twoweek run shakespeares shortest play has been made 
even shorter in this production performed at just over two hours 
with no intermission it just seems longer 
director nick ward has a concept but not a play this is bare 
bones shakespeare with no scenery and tattered grimy allpurpose 
costumes eight actors play all the roles when not acting they sit 
trancelike on benches located on three sides of the stage 
that dispassion carries over to their performances ken drury a 
nicol williamson lookalike possesses a resonant voice but it has 
little emotion at least a quivering amelda brown suggests lady 
macbeths obsession with power nothing else in this forlorn revival

sabotaged electrical and 
telephone service hampered election officials plan for a quick vote 
count in the presidential election 
the plan had been for each of more than 260 voting location in 14 
provinces to transmit facsimiles of its returns by telephone to the 
national election council in the capital sunday night after the 
polls closed 
election officials had said they expected to have preliminary 
returns on election night that turned out to be optimistic 
at midnight on election night the council announced it was 
suspending the count because of technical problems with the 
computer 
on monday morning jorge alberto diaz the council member who 
represents the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena 
told reporters that returns were not yet in from some areas affected 
by power outages 
leftist rebels lifted their transport ban on monday but on 
election day there were reports that returns could not be delivered 
because of dangerous conditions on the roads 
basic service like telephones and electricity are favorite 
guerrilla targets and more than half the nations electrical grid is

an appeals court has denied a widows claim 
for 100000 in life insurance saying it couldnt create a legal 
purgatory in which her braindead husband could be judged dead for 
life insurance and alive for his medical insurance 
the judges suggested a change in floridas insurance laws 
ken kepler 49 suffered a heart attack may 28 1986 it left him 
with extensive irreversible brain damage and he was in a vegetative 
state in a hospital for 11 months 
he was pronounced dead april 29 1987 20 days after the family 
obtained a court order allowing doctors to withhold food and water 
that date also was 10 days after expiration of his term life 
insurance policy the only life insurance he had 
family attorney bruce marger contended kepler died when he 
suffered the heart attack since paramedics revived his heart rate 
and breathing but he never regained consciousness or more than 
minimal brain function 
marger said his position was supported by public policy set by 
courts in at least three other states concerning the time of death 
where the dying process is interfered with by artificial means 
a pinellas county judge rejected that argument as did the 2nd 
district court of appeal last month 
under any acceptable definition of death mr kepler did not 
die before the expiration of his life insurance policy the 
appeals court ruled we cannot rewrite the contract between the 
parties 
while the plaintiffs argument would provide a comforting 
solution in this case it would create numerous problems in other 
cases 
the judges said they could not invent a legal purgatory in 
which kepler would have been dead for life insurance purposes but 
alive so medical insurance could cover the remaining time he was 
hospitalized 
but in the same ruling the judges said the case suggests the 
florida legislature should pass a law to automatically extend the 
coverage of term life insurance policies when the insured is in a 
chronic vegetative state 
term life insurance pays benefits if the insured dies during a 
certain period premiums are less than for whole life insurance 
which has no expiration date provides larger benefits and offers 
investment opportunities 
the judges said they could foresee people forced to balance 
their love for a family member against their needs in the future for 
life insurance proceeds 
tampa attorney michael n brown who represented keplers 
insurer georgia international life insurance co said extended 
coverage as the court suggested would require increased premiums and 
negate the attraction of term life insurance 
we sympathize with her brown said of widow lynnette kepler 
45 who was married to kepler 20 years and had four children with 
him she got a bum deal but it wasnt the fault of the insurance 
company 
brown said the company could not voluntarily pay the 100000 she 
was seeking because of the precedent it would set and the concern it 
would raise among stockholders

police had to use tear gas to break up a melee 
monday between about 50 jewish feminists trying to worship at the 
sacred western wall and angry orthodox men who hurled chairs 
bottles and fruit at the women 
the ultraorthodox men apparently feared the women would try to 
repeat past feminist efforts to carry the bible which jewish 
tradition says only men may do and don the prayer shawls worn 
exclusively by male jews 
orthodox tradition has a virtual monopoly on religious affairs in 
israel 
one woman was slightly injured by a chair that struck her head 
and neck police spokesman uzi sandori said he said there were no 
arrests 
the western wall also known as the wailing wall is judaisms 
holiest site it is the only remaining wall of the ancient jewish 
temple destroyed by the romans in 70 ad 
after the women entered a specified womens prayer area orthodox 
men stormed the cordonedoff section and threw chairs fruit and 
anything they put their hands on at the praying women sandori 
said 
ushers who work at the western wall tried to protect the women 
and warded off the men but police only firing tear gas after a 
woman began bleeding when she was hit by a chair sandori said 
he said the police did not act earlier because they are not 
allowed to interfere in a religious area unless called in by the 
religious ministry 
amihud bahat a spokesman for the ministry said the women at the 
wall had deliberately left their prayer shawls and bible at home and 
did nothing against the rules 
they are feminists but they behaved appropriately he said 
adding they were welcome to pray at the wall in the future

the action in congress this week is in the 
house which has a minimum wage debate on its agenda as well as 
items that could reshape the leadership of both parties in the 
chamber 
little legislation has moved through the congress so far this 
year with most of the time spent on the failed plan to raise 
congressional pay and the senate battle over the nomination of john 
tower for defense secretary 
president bush lost that one but his nomination of rep dick 
cheney to the pentagon post sailed to confirmation last week before 
the senate shut down for a twoweek recess 
gop lawmakers are expected to choose wednesday between two 
candidates vying to replace cheney in the no 2 leadership post 
pragmatist edward madigan of illinois and flamboyant conservative 
newt gingrich of georgia 
the balloting in that race will come as the chambers ethics 
committee deliberates whether speaker jim wright violated house

a boy who turns into a man an autistic 
genius a swedish peasant a hardbitten fbi agent a dedicated math 
teacher 
has there ever seem such a diverse collection of nominees for 
best actor each performance seems unique creating a difficult 
choice for academy voters 
gene hackman has been in oscar contention before he was 
nominated for supporting performances in bonnie and clyde 1967 
and i never sang for my father 1970 and won the big prize as 
the relentless popeye doyle in the french connection 1971 
hackman 58 is one of those actors who seems to get better with 
age he gets kidded about his lack of selectivity last year he 
appeared in five films within three months but invariably he draws 
praise from critics and his fellow actors his one memorable film of 
1988 was mississippi burning for which he was nominated 
as the southern sheriff turned fbi agent hackman once more 
brought depth to what could have been a surface role i always 
manage to find a way in films to be a bit introspective he said 
in a recent magazine interview it helps me as an actor makes me 
feel as if im doing something important 
max von sydows nomination as the downtrodden farmhand in pelle 
the conqueror was a rarity he won the recognition speaking a 
foreign language only one oscar has ever been awarded to a 
performer in a subtitled film sophia loren for two women 
although he has been acclaimed as a star of ingmar bergman films 
and international movies von sydow 66 has had no academy 
recognition until now 
i am not american and i am not english he says so my 
choice of parts in englishlanguage films is limited 
von sydow was delighted with his pelle role because it 
allowed him to use his own childhood dialect like the character 
lasse he grew up in a small swedish town he liked the role because 
it offered such a great variety of emotion in every new scene 
there is a new situation and a new attitude from the man 
although robin williams had a breakthrough nomination last year 
with good morning vietnam comedy has traditionally been held 
in low regard by academy voters now tom hanks is trying to break 
that tradition as a nominee for big he made a comedic gem out 
of the role of 13yearold josh baskin who overnight is granted his 
wish to become a grownup 
for hanks 32yearold graduate of sitcom bosom buddy the 
role required no methodactor searching for identity i just 
imagined what it would be like to be a 13yearold he says simply 
the kid is on the immature side hanks adds and i must say 
i was much the same when i was his age it wasnt until i was 14 
that i started growing up and becoming highly intelligent and 
debonair 
two of the other nominees for best actor faced more difficult 
transformations edward james olmos the slim laconic lt martin 
castillo of tvs miami vice shaved his mustache thinned his 
hair and added 40 pounds to portray east los angeles teacher jaime 
escalante in stand and deliver the boliviaborn escalante 
attracted wide attention by inspiring his students to such high 
academic achievements that they were suspected of cheating 
what motivates escalante is the sheer love of teaching 
observes olmos 42 when he see the light in a students eyes 
its a natural high like adrenalin he needs it like a performer 
who needs applause 
olmos himself has been attracting applause since his appearance 
as the macho narrator of luis valdez play and the 1971 movie 
zoot suit his role as lt castillo won him the emmy 
dustin hoffman exerted his customary thoroughness in preparing 
for his role as raymond babbit the autistic man with a genius for 
numbers in rain man after reading the initial script he 
puzzled over the paradox of a man whose autism crippled him for 
normal living but who nevertheless could perform superhuman feats 
of calculation 
for a year hoffman visited with autistic savants and their 
families and talked with medical experts about the phenomenon out 
of his research came the portrayal of a man who seemingly could not 
converse with anyone yet was capable of surprising flashes of 
wisdom 
hoffman 51 had plenty of time to prepare as rain man 
underwent changes of directors and scripts in the first days under 
director barry levinson the actor remained unsatisfied but the 
pair finally reached agreement 
its like in baseball he says you hit a home run and then 
you start popping up what youre trying to do is just connect meet 
the ball in the movies youre trying to make contact but not 
until its over do you find out where it went

portraying the physically or mentally impaired 
presents a challenge to film actors who must make the part credible 
as well as sensitive academy award voters have rewarded several for 
their efforts with the coveted oscar this year dustin hoffman and 
tom hanks are competing for the best actor prize based on their 
roles as adults with diminished mental capacities as critics noted 
both infused their parts with credibility keeping their characters 
grounded in the realities of their predicaments rather than playing 
tinsel town cliches 
tom is fun but he had to be more restrained said 
director penny marshall innocent and shy was better than loud and 
brash and broad if his character is just skipping down the block 
and making silly faces i dont think you get involved with the 
movie 
basically you have to not act like what you think a child acts 
like but get in touch with the child inside of you 
indeed both actors found the key to their depictions from within 
i simply pretended i was 12 years old thats all i did said 
the 32yearold hanks of his role as josh baskin a child locked in 
a mans body in big 
hoffman who plays a compulsive autistic savant in rain man 
discovered the secret to raymond babbitt by examining his own 
fastidious acting habits i suddenly realized that i was playing 
off myself because i know something about obsession and im 
comfortable being obsessive the 51yearold actor said the 
rest of it just took care of itself 
such introspection brought more than believability to rain 
man and big it also allowed both actors to touch on emotions 
not limited to their characters situation 
in rain man for example hoffmans autistic savant was used 
not for melodrama but to illuminate the fear of the unknown and the 
desire for order that many of us share and as a youngster suddenly 
thrust into a cutthroat corporate environment hanks hinted that 
innocence and fairness can in the end prevail 
yet given their subject matter both films ran the risk of 
falling into hollywood formula where complicated disorders are 
reduced to plot devices and multidimensional people with 
disabilities are simplified for audience appeal 
actors such as oscarwinner jack nicholson as a renegade mental 
patient in 1975s one flew over the cuckoos nest and 
emmywinner larry drake the mildly retarded office clerk on la 
law have been singled out for accurately portraying the mentally 
impaired 
and academy award voters and film critics have praised a variety 
of other actors playing characters with mental and physical 
impairments jane wyman won an oscar for playing a deafmute in 
1948s johnny belinda patty duke was awarded a statuette for 
her depiction of helen keller in 1962s the miracle worker 
marlon brando was commended for his performance as an injured war 
veteran for 1950s the men cliff robertson won an oscar for 
playing a man with mental retardation in 1968s charly jon 
voight took the best actor prize for playing a paraplegic in 1978s 
coming home john malkovich was a best supporting actor nominee 
for his role as a blind border in 1984s places in the heart 
and john hurt and charles laughton suffered pounds of daily 
makeup and folded their bodies into contorted positions for 
sensitive roles they played for his lead in 1980s the elephant 
man hurt received a nomination for best actor laughton won 
critical and industry praise in 1939s the hunchback of notre 
dame 
but many others have been faulted for overblown inaccurate 
representations 
josie abady directed the play the boys next door about four 
mentally handicapped men in a group home 
like all people people who are handicapped are funny theyre 
pathetic theyre great abady said 
you just think cheap shot and youve got the stereotype 
drake said hoffmans character and my character both have a full 
range of emotion and that seems to surprise people that the 
characters can feel as much as they feel and note as much as they 
note 
as originally written by barry morrow rain man described 
hoffmans autistic character as an overgrown cabbage patch doll 
a person with the lovable huggable habits of the mentally retarded 
as typically seen through entertainment industry eyes 
but dustin suggested that it would be more interesting if the 
guy was more autistic more quirky and less cuddly said rain 
man coscreenwriter ron bass the idea is that there would be 
two autistic characters the raymond character who is clinically 
autistic and the charlie character a coldhearted car salesman 
played by tom cruise who is emotionally autistic 
in this situation you dont fall in love with dustin right 
away bass said hes a difficult guy and just when you think 
what hes doing is kind of cute and sweet he does something 
completely weird 
hoffmans depiction of autism was much better than what hes seen 
in the past said george zitnay executive director of the joseph p 
kennedy jr foundation 
zitnay said movies tend to depict the disabled as being much 
more disabled than they really are my attitude has always been 
that films have done a disservice to persons with mental 
retardation 
as the creators of rain man tried to be true to the autism 
disorder the makers of big also chose not to let the script or 
its star resort to shtick 
its such a highconcept idea that theres a huge temptation to 
just play the jokes and not the emotion or character said big 
cowriter gary ross 
but i think the movie lets us reveal a lot about the adult 
world using josh as a mirror that we all have a child inside us 
and we all can operate childishly as soon as you start trying to 
figure the character out intellectually you lose it

five impressive performances have made the 
competition for best supporting actress one of the most difficult to 
predict in recent academy history 
the portrayals are diverse a secretary a dog trainer a bigots 
wife a french noblewoman a business executive three of the 
actresses are in the early stages of promising careers two are 
unquestioned stars 
sigourney weaver is the only one of the five to have been 
nominated before as the female rambo in aliens 1986 this year 
she finds herself in two categories as leading actress in 
gorillas in the mist and supporting actress in working girl 
weaver 39 has been praised for her bravery in both films for 
working with the gorillas and for taking a secondary role as the 
duplicitous boss of melanie griffith in working girl 
its a very funny role as a wall street tycoonshark or 
sharkess weaver said the film really stars melanie griffith 
and harrison ford but i have a very juicy supporting role i 
thought it was a good antidote to the hardship and sadness of 
gorillas in the mist 
geena davis is a new girl in town about 30 she declines to 
state she has played a ghost in beetlejuice an insects 
girlfriend in the fly and a spacelings lover in the forthcoming 
earth girls are easy her costar in the latter two films was 
her husband jeff goldblum 
the accidental tourist is a more conventional role though 
she is definitely offbeat as the freethinker who comes to train 
william hurts dog and stays to form a romance 
i read the ann tyler book when it first came out and i loved 
the character of muriel she says its kind of amazing that i 
got to work in the movie and people liked it and its all worked 
out 
frances mcdormand 31 the least known of the supportingactress 
nominees is well respected among her fellow professionals a 
graduate of the yale school of drama she has won acclaim for stage 
portrayals especially for her role as stella in a streetcar named 
desire for which she won a recent tony nomination she appeared 
in two films by joel and ethan coen blood simple and raising 
arizona 
in mississippi burning mcdormand plays the pivotal role of 
the wife of a deputy sheriff who is involved in the murder of three 
civil rights workers in a recent magazine interview she upheld the 
film against its detractors 
a lot of things havent changed that much since 1964 thats 
why i think the movie is so important i would consider the movie a 
failure if people came away from it saying oh these things 
happened in mississippi in 1964 how terrible 
instead i hope they come out of it thinking these things 
happen all over the country and theyre still happening 
joan cusack is best remembered as the frantic news producer in 
broadcast news and as a regular on nbcs saturday night 
live shell be seen next month in say anything as the sister 
of john cusack her reallife brother 
cusack 26 won her nomination as the wisecracking pal of melanie 
griffith in working girl she recently talked about the 
difference between the two women 
melanie and i are best friends but she wants to move up from 
being a secretary to being an executive and it distresses me i 
mean we have a life together we ride the same ferry to work we 
take our coffee break together we lunch together thats enough for 
me im a basically happy person but melanie wants more 
a former beauty pageant contestant in orange county calif 
michelle pfeiffer languished in forgettable films grease 2 
charlie chan and the curse of the dragon queen and what she 
calls junk television delta house bad cats that 
changed when she scored as al pacinos cool mistress in scarface 
after playing one of the title roles opposite jack nicholson in 
the witches of eastwick pfeiffer 31 became a hot ticket last 
year she appeared in three major films tequila sunrise 
married to the mob and dangerous liaisons the latter 
brought her the nomination for supporting actress 
it was no easy role she played the almost saintly madame de 
tourvel who is cruelly seduced by a rakish nobleman john malkovich 
and then destroyed when he abandons her the role required her to 
have about three nervous breakdowns she says 
the actress recalled sitting in with malkovich in her dressing 
room and complaining i cant do this i cant do this again 
though she cried so much she came to work with her eyes swollen 
shut she reverted to her native confidence that it was all there 
and i wouldnt have any trouble

after years of tv addiction italians are finding 
their way out of the house and rediscovering the pleasures of 
theatergoing 
internationally known actors are turning down movie scripts in 
favor of the stage and spectators are responding by forming ticket 
lines at dawn to get into the hottest shows 
marcello mastroianni has tackled russian drama swedish film star 
ingrid thulin the sensuous woman in ingmar bergmans classic 1957 
film wild strawberries plays a domineering mother in a tragedy 
by the spanish playwright federico garcia lorca 
actress monica vitti is being peppered with offers to bring her 
hilarious performance as a brash reporter in ben hechts the front 
page back to the united states 
after more than a decadelong love affair with television 
italians are once more thirsty for their roots of great comedy and 
tragedy says university of rome sociology professor alberto 
abruzzese 
they want to be moved by reallife sounds and be tickled by the 
comedians they saw on the screen 
last year movie attendance in italy dropped by 18 percent while 
movie houses have been closing throughout the country new theaters 
have opened in naples florence and smaller cities to bring the 
total to 1700 nationwide 
thulin one of bergmans favorite actresses has returned to the 
stage after a 20year absence in lorcas the house of bernarda 
alba which is presently on tour in italy 
bergman himself will come to italy this year to direct an italian 
version of eugene oneills long days journey into night 
mastroiannis performance in nikita michailovs mechanical 
pianola produced a nightly traffic jam in romes central piazza 
argentina they play is adapted from a short story by chekhov 
mastroianni told interviewers he hadnt felt so thrilled since he 
won an oscar nomination for his role in dark eyes three years 
ago 
comedian ugo tognazzi riled a few government ministers and 
triggered controversy by improvising lines about corruption in high 
places during his stage version of molieres classic the miser 
italians spent 118 million on theater tickets in 1987 a 23 
percent increase from 1986 and 1988 figures point to another 20 
percent jump during that period the average price of an orchestra 
seat increased only about 16 percent from 18 to 21 
government statistics show that one out of five italians attended 
some sort of theater performance in 1988 
just as in roman times the government organized theater events 
for its people todays network of 14 statesubsidized theaters 
offer stage variety that ranges from translations of broadway hits 
to greek tragedy to italian classics 
post avantgarde performances and experimental groups at 500 
private theaters and four drama schools also get a share of the 42 
million which the italian government annually allocates to encourage 
the theater industry 
italys ancient theater tradition has its roots in the classics 
of greek theater tragedy comedy and satire in medieval times 
religious themes were popular 
during the renaissance a new form based on classic theater was 
shaped by machiavelli and others it gave way to the commedia 
dellarte which dominated italy and most of europe until the end of 
the 1700s 
luigi pirandello master of italys 20thcentury theater focused 
on the condition of the modern man 
while the classics are still popular they have competition from 
broadwaystyle productions 
vitti who starred in an allwoman version of neil simons odd 
couple last year has been touring italy in front page 
the success has been incredible she said spectators have 
stood on line all night in turin and lucca police have had to 
intervene to stop punchups over tickets and were still going 
strong after four months on tour 
vitti has received offers to bring the show to new york los 
angeles and buenos aires but her fear of flying makes her hesitate 
a scuffle erupted new years eve in milan over the presentation 
of trojan women in ancient greek fifty spectators fought over 
the remaining four tickets on sale at a theater 
other serious dramas including works by shakespeare and 
pirandello are playing to soldout crowds andrea jonasson the

there arent many bands who have made charlie 
chaplin cry and brigitte bardot laugh but then they arent many 
bands that sound like the gipsy kings 
their music is a fiery blend of flamenco jazz and latin sounds 
driven by a halfdozen guitars their lyrics are sung in gitane a 
mixture of spanish french and gypsy 
its not the usual top 40 fare yet the band from the south of 
france international stars in europe has broken onto the us 
charts with their catchy bamboleo 
its funny to see in billboard that were in different 
categories each time said chico bouchikhi speaking through an 
interpreter nobody knows where to place us 
the music isnt the only thing thats different about this band 
the groups army of six guitar players are all related brothers 
nicolas and andre reyes are joined by their brotherinlaw 
bouchikhi and three cousins diego paco and tonino baliardo 
a family is able to live work do music and have fun together 
its better to have it that way said bouchikhi speaking just 
prior to the bands appearances this month on saturday night 
live and the tonight show starring johnny carson 
the band has played together for the past 16 years crossing 
barriers of language music and geography as their career slowly 
progressed they started out playing street corners and cafes for 
change where they quickly attracted an impressive coterie of fans 
one of their first boosters was the legendary comic charlie 
chaplin they met the little tramp while playing on the streets of 
switzerland and he became their biggest fan weeping as the gypsies 
played their traditional songs 
it was a very very strong moment for the band because he 
cried as he listened to the music said bouchikhi it was very 
strong to realize that someone who had made the whole world laugh 
for so long could cry to our music 
and what about bardot 
we met by chance about 10 years ago when we received an offer 
to play for one of her birthday parties bouchikhi said it went 
really well and everybody was dancing and happy so we became 
friends she was kind of a godmother for the group 
the gipsy kings repaid her friendship by recording a song about 
bardot titled in english woman 
language has never been a problem for the group as they moved 
around the world bamboleo and its followup djobi djoba 
were huge hits 
emotion and passion do not need language really and thats the 
most important language really bouchikhi said words to us are 
not secondary but not that important its a general feeling of the 
music 
and despite the growing success the band doesnt want to become 
too successful the idea of the gipsy kings headlining at giants 
stadium doesnt hold much appeal for the group bouchikhi said 
whats important is to keep the idea of a big party some kind 
of joy and emotion he said and if youre playing to too many 
in a group its kind of difficult to keep the emotion together 
you have to keep some kind of balance its pretty easy to lose 
yourself while going up and up and up 
to prevent that group members rejoin their friends and relatives 
each year in an 80trailer caravan in arles france for an annual 
gypsy festival it is a time for the band to renew its family ties 
and relax 
we need to come back its very important to have the time to 
be together again before going out and traveling again said 
bouchikhi so we try to spend a lot of time in france

this is one of a series of periodic reports by 
the associated press on the economic social and political 
turbulence that has turned south america into a continent in crisis

these are the days of the anonymous nocturnal 
bullet of the slashing of throats of village officials of the 
disappearance of union leaders 
so wrote cesar hilderbrandt in a column recently in si magazine 
in a passage that epitomizes the desperation of todays peru a 
nation struggling with economic chaos and a savage leftist 
insurgency that threatens to explode into civil war 
from cab drivers to congressmen peruvians are asking themselves 
what went wrong in their andean country which had one of south 
americas strongest economies until the 1960s 
more than 14000 people have been killed in the nineyear 
uprising by the the leftist shining path sendero luminoso 
guerrilla organization blackouts and bombs have become part of 
daily life in lima a paramilitary death squad has made its 
appearance 
inflation hit a record 1722 percent in 1988 and is widely 
projected to soar above 10000 percent this year pushing wages and 
salaries down to baresurvival levels the economy shrank 9 percent 
in 1988 and is likely to contract even more this year 
the collapse is putting hundreds of thousands of people out of 
work in the continents third largest country and one of its 
poorest in 1976 peru produced 34000 automobiles this year it is 
expected to assemble at the most 3500 few people can afford them 
although many peruvians blame president alan garcia for the 
chaos most independent analysts say the economic crisis had been 
building toward an eruption for the past several decades garcias 
populist freespending policies lit the fuse 
highway bandits have begun waylaying buses and automobiles 
making travel outside lima dangerous and adding to the sense of a 
disintegrating nation where law and order has broken down 
many peruvians now speak of the civil war that is coming 
seeing it as inevitable 
there is a very real danger that peru without realizing it is 
sinking deeper into the swamps of fratricidal war the magazine 
oiga commented in a recent editorial 
surveys indicate most people have little faith that solutions 
will be found 
garcia a dynamic young leader was elected in 1985 as the 
president of hope but his defiant stance against paying the 
foreign debt now 19 billion cut peru off from international aid 
and his uncontrolled spending bankrupted the country critics say 
these days angry crowds shout alan you charlatan when he 
speeds by in heavily armed convoys 
in recent months lima has been hit by waves of coup rumors and 
many peruvians doubt the presidential election scheduled for april 
1990 will take place leftist military officers seized power in 
1968 constitutional government was restored in 1980 
former mayor alfonso barrantes of lima a marxist is one of the 
favorites in the campaign the other frontrunner is the writer 
mario vargas llosa leader of a centerright coalition 
peruvians frequently mention the opening passage in vargas 
llosas 1974 novel conversation in the cathedral saying it 
succinctly reflects their feelings now 
from the doorway of la cronica santiago looks at the avenida 
tacna without love cars uneven and faded buildings the gaudy 
skeletons of posters floating in the mist the gray midday at what 
precise moment had peru screwed itself up 
one who saw things that way was morty weisselberg 41 a 
secondgeneration peruvian who had a highpaying job as the manager 
of a small metallurgical company he packed up and left a few months 
ago for canada with his wife and two small daughters before he left 
he explained why 
what worries me is the kind of future i am going to leave my 
children the future that this country offers is very different 
from the one 30 years ago when i was in the position of my children 
then there was a bright future for the country at least 
apparently 
the weisselbergs were among 150000 peruvians most of them 
professionals and skilled workers who bought oneway tickets out 
the country in 1988 the largest exodus in perus history

many blame perus economic decline on several decades of 
government mismanagement controls that have stifled private 
enterprise and strident nationalism that has frightened away foreign 
investors and isolated peru from world financial centers 
more than anything weisselberg said before he left he was 
frightened by what he saw as the countrys deep class divisions and 
its growing violence 
political analysts agree with him that perus social and racial 
divisions inherited from the spanish colonial era have spawned 
class hatred that threatens to rip apart the fabric of peruvian 
society 
the scorn and discrimination shown by perus white elite toward 
the darkskinned indian and mestizo majority has generated deep 
resentment among perus poor say social scientists 
political violence in peru is not the result of poverty alone 
but of humiliation oppression class hatred racism said sen 
enrique bernales head of a blueribbon senate panel on violence 
for many peruvian and foreign political experts peru now stands 
at a critical point in its 165year history where an antiquated 
inequitable and inefficient politial structure is crumbling 
for me the shining path is nothing more than the violent 
natural expression of this social explosion said luis lumbreras 
one of perus most important archaeologists if it had not been 
shining path sooner or later there would have been another group

dick cheney may be too good for the pentagon 
theyre starting to make him sound like a saint 
the senate confirmed cheney at top speed unanimously one week 
after president bush named him to be secretary of defense a 
striking contrast to the 10week struggle that led to the rejection 
of former sen john g tower for the job 
one republican senator called the quick confirmation a rush to 
judgment but voted for cheney anyhow but then speed and harmony 
were understandable given the senators appraisals of the sixterm 
congressman from wyoming 
cheney was pronounced trustworthy steady realistic pragmatic 
remarkable moral unique superb experienced tough 
compassionate outstanding academically exemplary committed 
unflappable smart a man of integrity and the ultimate legislator 
all of that in an hours discussion with no harsh words except 
for leftover complaints that tower had been treated unfairly and was 
still being maligned by published accusations of excessive drinking 
cheneys path to confirmation began with banter after weeks of 
gallows humor about dry happy hours cheney said he had enjoyed his 
one public appearance before the senate armed services committee 
it was a lot of fun he said 
none of it was fun for tower even before he was publicly accused 
of drinking too much and stepping out on his wives when he was 
married from the outset he had faced critical questions about the 
consulting fees he received from defense contractors after he left 
the senate in 1985 contractors he would have dealt with as 
secretary of defense 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said there was nothing on the cheney record to even hint at a 
conflict of interest or any other problem he insisted the committee 
had taken no shortcuts on the cheney nomination that this nominee 
is being treated like all others 
but the senate obviously was in a hurryup mood after the tower 
rejection besides the twoweek easter recess began on friday and 
the people who had rejected one nominee didnt want to leave on 
vacation without filling the job 
it usually is easier the second time around senators who have 
voted against a presidential nominee dont want to do it again but 
it doesnt always work that way richard m nixon was defeated on 
successive nominations to the supreme court 
cheney would have been overwhelmingly confirmed in the first 
place he does not pose as a defense expert but he needs no pose 
cheney knows government from the inside as a white house aide and 
gerald r fords chief of staff he is a firmly conservative 
republican no 2 in his partys house leadership but he draws 
solid praise from democrats as well as gop colleagues 
towers nomination was damaged by delay before it ever got to the 
senate it took more than a month for the president to announce that 
he was choosing tower a delay the white house blamed on the need to 
check out accusations it said were proven groundless the senate 
heard similar accusations and decided otherwise 
nunn leading the debate against tower said even the bush 
transition team had internal differences on the nomination there 
was no hesitation on the cheney appointment bush made it one day 
after tower was rejected it was not set up in advance of the senate 
vote but chief of staff john sununu had raised the possibility with 
cheney by seeking his counsel on candidates for the pentagon 
one public and one closeddoor hearing later the armed services 
committee voted 20 to 0 for cheney and a day after that he was 
confirmed 
nunn insisted the committee had checked cheney out carefully and 
thoroughly and had followed its standing procedures on nominees 
that included an fbi report sen john warner rva said more than 
100 people were checked in that part of the process 
the fbi report on tower concentrating on his drinking habits 
became a central issue in that debate even though it was secret 
senators could read it but could not cite or quote from it that 
process was unique 
nunn and warner read the fbi report on cheney and told other 
committee members they found nothing detrimental nunn said that is 
standard and sufficient in most cases although other committee 
members can arrange to see fbi reports if they deem it necessary in 
this case none did 
lets not make any mistake about it this is a rush to 
judgment insisted sen arlen specter rpa lets not make it a 
precedent 
he also observed that it is possible to rush to the right 
judgment

war whoops pierced the desert stillness 
tomtoms kept the beat as dancers circled under the starry sky and 
the campfire flickered their shadows on the adobe walls 
the american indian had come to arabia 
the fascinated onlookers were bahrainis who also have tribal 
origins but dance to different drums 
the occasion was a crosscultural powwow during a visit by the 
american indian dance theatre a 15member troupe touring the middle 
east and europe under the auspices of the us information service 
the americans representing eight indian tribes from apache to 
zuni said they were delighted by the arabs enthusiasm at their 
performances featuring traditional dances in authentic dress 
we show them the vibrant colors our beadwork the songs 
dances in a sense theyre just like us they have their tribal 
songs and dances that are new to us just as ours are to them 
said marty pennecoose 31 a southern ute who now lives in salem 
ore and works as a highiron construction worker 
the desert gathering arranged by the us embassy was a private 
affair held in the ruins of an 80yearold sheiks palace within 
sight and smell of bahrains oil and gas fields 
the 50 or so guests sat on rugs in the sand eating middle 
eastern food including four roast lambs to watch an allmale 
bahraini dance group perform 
the indians later staged an impromptu performance long hair and 
braids flew as the dancers wearing jeans cowboy boots and sneakers 
instead of tribal costumes mingled with the bahrainis in their 
white dishdashi robes and arab headdress 
pennecoose said it was a learning process going to these 
different countries experiencing their surroundings and cultures 
things that wed only see in books 
we want to show the rest of the world what we have to offer 
he said its a good thing what were doing dancing around the 
world 
arlie neskahi 32 a navajo and lead singer said he found 
cultural similarities as well as differences 
our people are shepherds and i grew up eating lamb and goat 
said neskahi who wore an arab head scarf wrapped in the style of 
yemen one of the groups earlier stops 
my father always told me it takes all the colors of the rainbow 
to make it beautiful he said 
we want to share our cultures with other people who dont know 
anything about us said chester mahooty 60 a zuni indian from 
new mexico and the troupes senior member 
the people here think that john wayne is the most popular not 
the indians we have to tell them the truth 
it was that stereotype that the companys founder and producer 
barbara schwei said she wanted to dispel 
i felt there was definitely a need to express the american 
indian culture to people because there is such a lack of 
information i thought it was time for a company done properly 
playing firstclass theaters all over the world schwei with 
director and choreographer hanay geiogamah picked the dancers 
during visits to indian powwows and festivals in the southern and 
northwestern united states 
the members are drawn from both american and canadian tribes 
geiogamah a kiowa delaware from oklahoma said the result is a 
kind of new pantribal idiom that helps indians preserve and 
expand an important art form 
mahooty who adorns himself with huge turquoise breastplates and 
rings said american indian dances emphasize a religious 
relationship with nature 
many are actedout prayers to the great creator mother 
earth or mountain spirits for rain good harvest or hunting 
eagle dances common from the northern plains to the 
southwestern pueblos pay homage to the soaring bird that indians 
believe has direct contact with deities in the sky 
for one bahraini it was a new look at a people we know only 
from cowboy films

twoyearold margaux lorraine and claire are busy 
bathing their dolls zoe is spongepainting three other toddlers 
paste spots inside a drawing of a big blue fish 
in the next room excited 15montholds throw rubber balls into a 
plastic swimming pool and then jump in 
in france where women make up 42 percent of the work force 
collective infant care subsidized by federal and local funds is a 
way of life for nearly 335000 children rich and poor under the 
age of 3 
to get a firsthand look at frances muchadmired system 14 us 
childcare experts recently spent two weeks touring nearly two dozen 
day care centers preschools and dropin centers in paris and the 
provinces 
they met with french child care professionals and government 
officials looking for ways to improve child care services in the 
united states 
in the us were still light years away from what weve seen 
here said evelyn k moore executive director of the national 
black child development insitutute in washington dc who took 
part in the visit sponsored by the frenc 
receive special training including nursing skills day care center 
directors are registered nurses who have had additional training 
plus five years of day care experience 
the law requires one aide for every five infants who do not walk 
and one aide for every eight who do walk each center has its own 
pediatrician child psychologist and dietician who make two visits 
weekly along with a fulltime laundress cook and cleaning 
personnel 
in the us we basically have untrained people working in child 
care in france child care is considered a profession and has 
status said susanne martinez legislative counsel to sen alan 
cranston dcalif 
mrs revel said the locale a cheerful brandnew facility 
designed to handle young children was another reason she opted for 
day care 
its very safe the children arent being told constantly not 
to do this or that their only restraints are with regard to each 
other 
health and safety regulations are a major concern for child care 
advocates in france and the united states while many mothers say 
children in day care are sick more frequently than children kept at 
home child care professionals disagree 
bettye caldwell professor of early childhood education at the 
university of arkansas in little rock says statistics show that 
infants under 12 months in day care get 10 colds a year as opposed 
to 8 colds for children who stay home 
out of 66 children here there are always about a dozen who are 
sick and theyre always the same ones said nada finztler the 
director of a day care center in central paris 
american experts are also examining french day care funding 
parents pay the equivalent of 150 to 1800 a day on a sliding 
scale linked to their income 
officials say the overall costs for a single day of child care in 
paris is about 33 and up to 50 in the provinces parent fees cover 
roughly 30 percent of operating costs national and municipal 
government funds make up the difference 
im especially impressed by frances commitment to child care 
from the national level down to the municipal level and the 
integration of support from each level ms martinez said 
french municipalities pay for building child care facilities and 
provide equipment the education ministry oversees preschool 
teacher training and the social affairs ministry handles child care 
aids 
several experts said they were surprised by the french systems 
near universal availability 
what strikes me is that programs in france are for all kinds of 
families whereas in the united states the care would be directed 
towards lowincome and disadvantaged families said david edie a 
day care specialist at the wisconsin department of health and social 
services 
he said the proposed act for better child care known as the abc 
bill in congress in washington targets only lowincome families 
it would earmark 25 billion to provide more child care 
facilities upgrade training for child care workers subsidize the 
care costs for lowincome families and create resource and referral 
services 
edie called the bill a drop in the bucket and said it would 
not affect middleclass doubleincome families who would still have 
to scramble for costly private care 
frances child care system is an extension of family policies 
adopted decades ago to counter a falling birthrate and population 
devastation wrought by war 
edie says the french have understood better than most that child 
care is not just a babysitting service but an educational 
experience 
we can learn a lot from the french said mrs moore its 
clear their government has made a firm commitment to young children 
and families were just not there yet but child care is a service 
whose time has come 
at mrs finztlers day care center in les halles nearly 100 
children from 2 months to 3 years of age are engaged in different 
activities 
the 2yearolds bang on drums and blow into recorders 
afterwards they lie on the floor breathing deeply to relax 
we focus on introducing new physical sensations and 
experiences mrs fintzler said earlier the toddlers took off 
their clothes and slid around in soft white flour learning about 
softness and slipperiness 
the tots also love splashing finger paint all over each others 
naked bodies learning about sexual difference and losing 
inhibitions about whats clean or dirty she said

editors note the idea was to protect the elderly from 
catastrophic health bills without adding to the deficit the 
solution was to tax affluent retirees to fund a new insurance 
program but what seemed like fiscal prudence to congress smacked of 
tax tyranny to dan hawley a retired airline pilot whos launched a 
grassroots rebellion against the new medicare law

with his bolo ties and legs bowed by knee 
troubles daniel hawley has the look of an aging cowboy bent on 
kicking up one more ruckus thats precisely what the 64yearold 
retired pilot has in mind 
hawley and his wife marsha 51 have launched a momandpop 
petition drive aimed at a decision by congress to fund a new 
catastrophic health insurance program for old people by taxing 
elderly retirees 
the petition drive has attracted 140000 signatures from people 
irate about the new medicare law which will tack 800 or more onto 
the annual tax bills of hawley and other affluent retirees 
its a grassroots rebellion fed by retirees fears that if 
congress can put a special tax bite on them to pay for these 
benefits the lawmakers will do it again and again 
the outcries have caught lawmakers by surprise they were trying 
to patch some of the cracks in medicare that had spurred sales of 
highcost lowbenefit medigap insurance policies 
they also wanted to free the aged of the worry of being 
bankrupted by catastrophic medical bills without adding to the 
deficit or raising taxes 
when thenpresident reagan signed the legislation last july 1 he 
noted with pride that it follows the same premise as all sound 
insurance programs it will be paid for by those who are covered by 
its services 
thats a change in attitude in this country boasted sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee 
the new law divides the 33 billion fiveyear cost of benefits 
among the 33 million medicare beneficiaries not equally but 
according to ability to pay 
all but the poorest pay a 4amonth premium that generates 37 
percent of the money needed the other 63 percent of the costs are 
picked up by a supplemental premium or surtax on the 40 
percent of medicare beneficiaries with enough income to owe at least 
150 in federal income taxes 
what seemed like fiscal prudence to reagan and bentsen smacked of 
tax tyranny to dan hawley and his loosely knit band of confederates 
he claims the new medicare benefits are minuscule and the costs 
are steep and he inveighs bitterly against the dictators who 
railroaded this big caboozle through congress 
the senior citizens of america are in the greatest fight they 
have been in since world war ii and this time it is with their own 
congress said the whitehaired hawley a onetime pile driver 
from chicago who boasts that he never bent any tin during nearly 
34 years as an american airlines pilot 
congress did a marvelous job of keeping the public uninformed 
on the total extent of this bill the seniors are saying we did 
not ask for this bill take your benefit back leave us alone 
each mornings mail brings another stack of letters petitions 
and a few small checks for hawleys cause 
in florida we are all hopping mad who was on the committee 
that passed this abomination wrote a punta gorda fla man 
a pottstown pa retiree sent hawley a copy of the note he now 
sends charities informing them that until the new medicare act is 
repealed all of our funds previously available for good causes 
such as yours have been confiscated by the us government 
a lake city mich man complained that senior citizens are being 
forced to pay for the health care of profligate drug users and 
aids victims who for any reason have gained a place on the rolls of 
medicare and medicaid 
if indeed this concept is the trend of the future ie 
make those who benefit pay then please hasten to take us from 
the list of those who pay for child care education welfare adc 
lowincome housing and a myriad of other government giveaway 
programs from which we receive no direct benefit wrote the 
michigan retiree 
in washington bentsen and some of the other dictators at 
whom this torrent of complaints is aimed defend their legislation 
and argue that many of the critics are misinformed 
medicare remains the best buy in town for its rly or disabled beneficiaries 
including the 16 million seniors 
who will be hit with the maximum tax bentsen insists 
i hear some of these folks say well the odds are that 
theyre not going to need catastrophic illness covera33 million 
eldege well 
thats wonderful said bentsen 
well theres only onehalf a percent chance that your homes 
going to burn down but to be prudent most of us go out and buy fire 
insurance on our homes and if we dont go out and voluntarily do 
it the people that carry the mortgage insist that we do it and 
were delighted that we dont have to collect on it he said 
the same thing is true in catastrophic you would hope you 
never had to collect on it but 
the hawleys began their organization last summer after reading a 
senior columnists article in the las vegas reviewjournal and 
calling a meeting at a local senior citizens center 
some were aarp members dissatisfied with their own organizations 
stance 
aarp says it likes the catastrophic benefits but not the way 
they were financed the organization has held its ground despite 
pressure from some chapters 
hawley has debated a top aarp executive on public televisions 
macneillehrer news hour and squared off with aarp officials on 
other television and radio shows 
he isnt camerashy we are constantly talking over microphones 
in an airplane he explained 
while hawley speaks of waging a david vs goliath struggle 
against the aarp to lobby for repeal of the catastrophic act he 
disavows any intention of trying to turn his coalition into a 
permanent lobbying force 
others are using the fight over catastrophic coverage to try to 
sign seniors up for new organizations and banks and securities 
firms are using it to pitch taxfree investments 
hawleys petition warns that the elderly could wind up footing 
the bill for most of the medical costs of aids patients with 
the aids medication azt costing up to 10000 a year per patient 
hawley fears that elderly people with big drug bills could get 
frozen out of the program 
the prescription drug benefit has a cap so that only those with 
the steepest drug bills are helped some 55 million beneficiaries 
one in six will get medicare reimbursement for some of their drug 
costs 
but relatively few aids patients live long enough to get medicare 
some 10000 aids patients receive social security disability 
payments but only 900 have been on the disability rolls for the two 
years required to qualify for medicare according to social security 
spokesman phil gambino 
despite its name the catastrophic coverage act makes only a 
small dent in the financial problems confronting families trying to 
pay for longterm nursing home care which costs an average of 
25000 a year the new medicare law relaxes restrictions on the 
income and assets an elderly person can own when a spouse needs 
medicaid to help pay nursing home bills 
the uproar may make lawmakers leery of ever attempting to cover 
longterm care costs under medicare 
horace b deets the aarps executive director said the 
complaints about the medicare catastrophic act are a good example 
of what happens when you take a patchwork approach to a systemic 
problem we need something done for universal access to 
comprehensive care and it isnt here yet for everybody 
in addition to repealing the catastrophic act hawley also wants 
congress to set up a blueribbon presidential commission to examine 
the monstrous unresolved health care issues he would set one 
rule for this commission no politicians allowed 
hawley isnt saying when he will deliver his petitions to 
congress 
eisenhower didnt tell the germans when he was going to land 
the pilot said when the snowball is rolling down the mountain 
you dont stop it halfway 
if he loses the fight then i almost guarantee you that in two 
years congress has its greatest turnover ever the senior power 
will vote them out of office 
if he wins then you will never hear daniel hawleys name 
again hes going down and start playing golf all across this 
country

here is a look at the new or expanded benefits 
provided the elderly and disabled by the medicare catastrophic 
coverage act and how much beneficiaries will have to pay for them 
hospital medicare beneficiaries will pay a deductible of 564 
for their first days stay in the hospital each year but medicare 
pays the rest of their hospital bills no matter how long the stay 
previously there were limits on how much medicare would pay for 
stays longer than 60 days and patients were charged a deductible 
for each hospital admission after a 60day spell of illness 
effective jan 1 1989 
doctor bills starting in 1990 medicare beneficiaries will have 
to pay no more than 1370 in outofpocket expenses for doctor 
bills and other services under medicares part b however if their 
physician charges more than medicare approves they will still be 
liable for the difference 
medicare patients must pay the first 75 as a deductible on 
approved charges then medicare will pay 80 percent of other 
approved charges up to the 1370 threshold and 100 percent beyond 
it if a patients private insurance pays some of the bills that 
still counts toward the 1370 effective jan 1 1990 
drugs currently medicare pays only for prescription drugs 
administered in the hospital and for immunosuppressive drugs 
administered during the first year after an organ transplant 
starting in 1990 it will begin covering outpatient prescription 
drugs for the first time 
in 1990 medicare will help pay for certain antibiotics and other 
intravenous drugs and it will cover immunosuppressive drugs beyond 
the first year of a transplant after a 550 deductible medicare 
will pay 80 percent of the cost of intravenous drugs and 50 percent 
for the immunosuppressives 
in 1991 medicare will begin covering most other prescription 
drugs and insulin there will be a 600 deductible and 50 percent 
copayment for 1991 a 652 deductible and 40 percent copayment for 
1992 and a 20 percent copayment and deductible to be determined 
for 1993 and beyond 
skilled nursing facility medicare will pay for 150 days of 
skilled nursing care up from 100 days the copayment is limited to 
an estimated 22 per day for the first eight days the new law 
scraps a requirement that a patient had to be hospitalized for at 
least three days before entering a skilled nursing facility 
effective jan 1 1989 
home health care for those who meet medicares restrictive 
eligibility requirements the catastrophic act will provide up to 38 
consecutive days of care those who do not need daily care will be 
eligible for up to six days a week for as long as prescribed by a 
doctor effective jan 1 1990 
hospice care the new law provides unlimited hospice care for 
terminal patients it was previously limited to 210 days effective 
jan 1 1989 
respite care for someone caring at home for a medicare 
beneficiary requiring daily personal care medicare will pay for up 
to 80 hours per year of home health aide and personal care services 
limited to those who have met either the annual deductible for 
prescription drugs or the 1370 part b catastrophic limit 
effective jan 1 1990 
mammography medicare will pay up to 50 for xray screenings to 
detect breast cancer effective jan 1 1990 
taxes and premiums all medicare part b beneficiaries now must 
pay an extra 4 premium each month this will rise to 1020 per 
month in 1993 those who owe at least 150 in federal income taxes 
will also pay a supplemental premium based on that income tax 
liability the supplemental premium rate for 1989 is 2250 for each 
150 of federal income taxes or 15 percent if someone owes 1000 
in federal taxes they will have to pay an extra 150 in medicare 
supplemental premium the maximum supplemental premium is 800 per 
medicare beneficiary or 1600 per couple enrolled in medicare 
the supplemental premium or surcharge rises from 15 percent for 
1989 to 25 percent for 1990 26 percent for 1991 27 percent for 
1992 and 28 percent for 1993 in effect a 15 percent surcharge on 
the elderly boosts their 15 percent marginal tax rate to 1725 
percent and the 28 percent rate to 322 percent in 1993 the 28 
percent surcharge will boost the 15 percent rate to 192 percent and 
the 28 percent rate to 358 percent 
the house ways and means committee says 60 percent of the elderly 
will not be subject to the supplemental premium paying only the 
4amonth premium for their coverage it predicts that 5 percent of 
the elderly in 1989 and 10 percent in 1993 will pay the maximum 
supplemental premium they are generally individuals with adjusted 
gross incomes above 43000 this year and couples with incomes above 
85000 
the committee says more than 78 million medicare beneficiares 
or 22 percent will receive new benefits each year when the 
catastrophic act is fully implemented some 58 million will receive 
prescription drug benefits 24 million will have doctor bills and 
other charges in excess of the 1370 cap paid and 15 million will 
be spared having to pay more than one hospital deductible of 564 
each year 
although the new law does not provide direct coverage of 
longterm care costs it eases medicaid restrictions on how much 
income and assets an elderly spouse can keep when the other spouse 
is a medicaidfinanced nursing home resident 
effective sept 30 1989 spouses will be able to keep income of 
at least 122 percent of the federal poverty level or 786 per 
month these limits will rise to 133 percent of the poverty line on 
july 1 1991 and 150 percent on july 1 1992 in addition the new 
law allows states to permit the spouse to keep assets in addition 
to a home worth at least 12000 and possibly as high as 60000

granddaughter alice who lives in seattle she likes country and 
western she sings you are my sunshine my only sunshine 
alices singing is imitated by her famous grandmother 
imitating is one of the things miss fitzgerald does best in 
radio city she sings ghost of a chance like she thinks it would 
be done by a tenor saxophone trades scat phrases with bassist 
keeter betts and offers a louis armstronglike growl in her 
flagwaving final encore mack the knife 
in a voice that is light girlish and true she slips easily in 
and out of jazz always swinging when norman granz became her 
manager in 1954 he bought her contract from decca records and began 
recording her on his own new label verve instead of easing her 
slowly from jazz into the days pop hits he boldly moved her into 
classy popular music her first verve recording was the cole 
porter songbook 
shed been traveling with dizzy gillespie and was apprehensive 
about drastically changing styles id been singing bebop i 
thought the man was trying to get me out of the business 
instead the cole porter songbook introduced the singer to a 
larger nonjazz audience the record was followed by other 
songbooks devoted to the music of gershwin ellington rodgers 
and hart berlin arlen kern and others these days miss 
fitzgerald sweetly reminds audiences theyre available on cd 
if there was anybody left who didnt know ella fitzgerald they 
met her through commercials she sang for memorex tapes and a glass 
shattered kids liked it theyd always ask me when im going to 
break another glass we get on an airplane and pilots say whatever 
you do dont sing next to the window 
slimmed down from her previous look as a comfortably plump 
grandmother she posed for annie leibovitz for an american express 
ad the photographer chose a red dress hat and leopard coat from 
miss fitzgeralds closet posed her by her old convertible that had 
to be pushed into place and said something a bit raunchy miss 
fitzgerald doesnt say what to put a foxy lady look on her 
face 
she got me snazzy the singer smiles people take that 
picture out of magazines and ask me to autograph them they also 
recognize her voice singing isnt it romantic in american 
express tv ads as a couple loses a credit card in venice and picks 
up a replacement in beijing

mother slapped me down youve heard of seeing stars i saw stars 
she told me if somebody speaks to you you say hello 
once when she was pining miss fitzgerald says duke ellington 
told me its like a toothache itll hurt for awhile but when you 
take that tooth out you miss it but youll feel better 
and a cousin told her to smile even if people said something bad 
about her i used to be very selfconscious somebody looked at 
me i thought oh what are they saying i learned to smile its 
beautiful to feel you can smile and you can love people 
in 1987 after she recovered from her heart attack she played 
the hollywood bowl other dates were lined up but another shorter 
layoff intervened one of my toes had to be amputated i was 
wearing pointytoed evening shoes now i have to wear opentoed 
shoes i say thank god here i am walking 
last summer miss fitzgerald fell on a step on the hollywood bowl 
stage forget malpractice suits the backstage was instantly full of 
doctors eager to help the singer took a short intermission then 
returned to sing since i fell for you now she enters and leaves 
the stage holding her pianists arm 
her last recording easy living made with guitarist joe 
pass came out before her heart attack the month she turned 70 a 
30yearold record ella in rome the birthday concert was 
released for the first time it was taken from a recently found tape 
of a concert she did in rome on her 40th birthday 
shell record again this spring and would like to make her first 
music video in which she would dance possibly with children from a 
watts nursery thats named for her then break into song 
i love ballads because they tell a story miss fitzgerald 
says if its a pretty tune people start thinking about something 
that happened in their lives she told her radio city audience 
there will be something for everybody the only thing i dont have 
is rap i might try it as well as ballads and jazz she included 
a bossa nova had a rock beat behind aint nobodys business 
sang a stevie wonder song and did a gentle rap 
dont be surprised if she tries a countrywestern duet someday

editors note some years ago public outrage threatened to end a 
booming industry that of the tennessee walking horse the industry 
and the breed survive one reason is because of people like charles 
thomas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it would be nice if everybody could claim 
the title his government has bestowed upon charles thomas but few 
measure up thomas is officially a designated qualified person 
i dont know who thought up that name says thomas i guess 
they had to call us something 
what thomas and only about 75 others are designated to be 
qualified at is deciding whether a horse specifically a tennessee 
walking horse is fit to compete in a horse show 
for a while there he was saying the other day stroking the 
forehead of a brood mare who ambled over to the fence to greet him 
it looked like the whole walking horse business was going down the 
drain that would have been a shame its a beautiful breed 
it is most gentle with an easy gait that doesnt jar the rider at 
any speed it reaches its front feet high and far out one and then 
the other and brings its back feet forward to overstride the front 
its back remains as level as a love seat the high stretch of the 
front feet is what horsemen call the big lick a crowdpleasing 
action prized in show rings 
the gait is bred into the horse thomas explains with 
regular training a good horse will develop the big lick naturally 
but some trainers werent satisfied they took shortcuts tried to 
make something artificial out of whats supposed to be natural 
thats why we now have dqps designated qualified persons 
the shortcuts brought down upon the walking horse industry 
the wrath of the american horse protective association and other 
humane groups and finally congress in 1970 it passed the horse 
protection act aimed specifically at tennessee walking horses and 
assigned the us department of agriculture to enforce its 
provisions 
what the trainers would do says thomas grimacing was 
sore the horse 
first they built up the front feet by putting thick pads 
between the hoof and the shoe this raised the horse in front and 
gave him a longer reach a higher step then they did the worst 
part they burned the horse with a chemical blistering it above the 
front hooves and attached a heavy rough chain that would rub on 
the sore part 
the horse would try to kick the chains off like you would try 
to throw a bracelet off your wrist that bothered you the whole 
effect was to exaggerate the big lick 
the crowds loved it it really is exciting to watch the judges 
listened to the crowds and soon soring as it was called became 
the accepted way to treat a walking horse 
ive seen horses so sore they couldnt finish just give out 
ive seen horses walk off with blood running from above their 
hooves 
the memory causes thomas to shudder he cannot abide cruelty 
charles thomas is 50 he is a gentle soul with a voice like a 
southern lullaby he and his wife christine and their three 
children live in a friendly farmhouse a century old nestled against 
a clear spring on 96 acres of cumberland mountain foothills in this 
rural community near lynchburg 
both charles and christine work at the nearby jack daniels 
distillery he in the steam plant she in the bottling house 
walking horses are important to me thomas says but just 
as a sideline of course for a lot of folks around here their living 
is the walking horse business 
quite a business shelbyville a few miles north of here bills 
itself as the walking horse capital of the world and is the site 
of an annual 10day show called the celebration it is to walking 
horses what the kentucky derby is to thoroughbreds 
last years 50th annual celebration drew more than 3500 horses 
who competed before a paid attendance of 231000 devotees of the big 
lick 
its like a 10day carnival says thomas the fans get 
really into it one time i had to disqualify the favorite and i 
thought it might cause a riot they werent pleased 
thomas has been a dqp for six years and an inspector at the 
celebration the past five 
he recalls that when he first became an inspector he disqualified 
a horse at a small show and the trainer threatened him 
that hasnt happened since and i dont believe it will ever 
happen again the inspection program is accepted now and im 
accepted as a fair person so are the other dqps 
the owners and trainers realize its in their best interest we 
reject fewer horses each year at last years celebration for 
example 56 horses were rejected compared with 185 the year before 
why did i apply to become a dqp well i grew up around walking 
horses and love the breed i never could abide that business of 
soring them 
in the old days they were called plantation horses just a good 
sturdy horse you could ride all day without getting tired people 
around here would ride them to a show on sunday and ride them home 
it wasnt until they became big business sort of show 
business that trainers began soring them theres big money in it 
so when i heard about the dqp program i decided i would like to 
be one like to help get the breed back to what its supposed to be 
every friday and saturday night from the first of may through 
the end of october says thomas there will be a horse show at 
one place or another sometimes just small places around here like 
wartrace and belt buckle and winchester and i will be at one of 
them 
i will also go to auction sales and inspect there so the 
buyers can be sure they arent getting a horse thats been sored 
the way i do it i take up each front foot in turn i press all 
around the top of the hoof at one oclock two oclock all the way 
around 
i press with my thumb until my nail turns a little white that 
much pressure if the horse flinches at all just moves a little 
thats it i turn him down 
has it made the shows less sensational less spectacular with 
those highprancing steeds 
no says thomas emphatically 
now they have to produce that action by breeding it into the 
horse not by abusing them knowing that i believe the fans feel 
the shows are better than ever 
what designated qualified person would disagree

editors note foreign cadets at west point what better way to 
build good will and expose future foreign leaders to american 
ideals says a congressional report this years foreign cadets hail 
from bangladesh and botswana among other places 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the united states military academy is 
legendary for producing such allamerican war heroes as ulysses s 
grant douglas macarthur and dwight d eisenhower but the 
country in west points motto duty honor country does not 
necessarily mean the united states 
for the past century west point has also been a training ground 
for future generals of foreign armies dictatorships as well as 
democracies 
soldiers like filipino general fidel ramos the late nicaraguan 
dictator anastasio somoza and prerevolutionary chinese army gen 
ying hsing wen marched out of west points storied long gray line to 
play key historical roles 
this years foreign plebes come from bolivia guatemala lebanon 
liberia malaysia the philippines malawi singapore jordan 
turkey and zimbabwe currently 30 foreign cadets are training at 
west point from bangladesh haiti senegal cameroon liberia and 
botswana among other places 
once approved by the secretary of defense a nations politics or 
relations with the united states are not considered in judging an 
applicants merits says capt robin carrington admissions officer 
for foreign cadets 
we do not deal with philosophy carrington says we try to 
keep standards for foreign cadets exactly the same as us 
citizens 
there are cadets from countries ruled by hardline dictators who 
do not tolerate dissent or hold elections as well as from countries 
with democratic governments like that of the united states 
the purpose of educating foreign cadets at west point according 
to a congressional report is to build good will and expose future 
foreign military leaders to american ideals especially in 
developing nations where the united states seeks to promote 
stability 
annapolis and the air force academy have similar programs by 
law each military academy is allowed 40 foreign cadets at a time 
at the moment the air force academy has 37 and the navy academy 32 
our goal is to provide an opportunity for students from 
selected countries to attend the air force academy and learn more 
about the way we do business in this country and go back home with a 
firstrate military education and hopefully be better allies says 
lt col john swiney associate director of admissions at the us 
air force academy 
fidel ramos graduated from west point with honors in 1950 
thirtysix years later he played a pivotal role in the revolt that 
ended ferdinand e marcos 20year reign in the philippines and put 
corey aquino in power 
ramos developed friendships with west point classmates who went 
on to powerful posts in the us military including charles 
gabriel an air force chief of staff and john wickham who became 
the us armys chief of staff 
ramos is now philippine defense secretary and one of his 
countrys most popular figures a veteran of the korean and vietnam 
wars ramos is using his education to fight a communist insurgency 
and quell coups in the philippines 
natee wongissares a senior from bangkok thailand agrees that 
both countries have benefited from thailands cadets at west point 
in the future these people west point graduates have a 
tendency toward the united states the thai cadet says they can 
affect the relationship between the two countries for a better 
relationship they will work together 
unstable political climates in some third world countries where 
change is more apt to take the form of a coup than a democratic 
vote have created unusual situations for west point graduates 
capt moises cortizo class of 1980 is a loyal aide to 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega at odds with the united 
states since his indictment by an american grand jury on drug 
trafficking charges last year 
ricardo ernesto castro class of 1973 sought political asylum in 
the united states after testifying before congress about his 
activities as a leader of a salvadoran death squad 
anastasio debayle somoza son of the original nicaraguan dictator 
anastasio somoza was given command of the nicaraguan national guard 
when he graduated from west point in 1946 he went on to succeed his 
father as president before the sandinista revolution ended that 
regime 
west points first foreign cadets came from south america but 
the program has expanded virtually worldwide countries with cadets 
at west point are no longer necessarily us allies 
soviet cadets may enter west point classrooms next fall under a 
program approved by the reagan administration allowing west point 
and soviet military academies to exchange cadets for twoweek visits 
american cadets also have the opportunity to spend two weeks at a 
foreign military academy in one of more than 30 countries including 
venezuela jordan belgium morocco the dominican republic and 
japan 
of more than 70 nations invited 25 to 30 send applications many 
of americas strongest allies do not send cadets to west point nato 
member countries are invited but dont participate although a 
canadian midshipman is attending the naval academy 
foreign cadets dont compete against american candidates says 
academy spokeswoman andrea hamburger these spaces are 
specifically designated for nonamerican cadets they have to meet 
the same basic criteria as a cadet here would 
at west point all cadets eat the same food adhere to the same 
dress code take the same courses and meet the same requirements for 
graduation 
in addition to chemistry engineering and science courses they 
can study the history of technology and warfare the american 
experience in korea and vietnam space mechanics terrain analysis 
military computer systems military ethics and nuclear reactor 
design 
they are usually very very serious students and good students 
depending on where they are from some struggle with english says 
carrington 
some have more than a language barrier to overcome 
carrington recalls one cadet from an african tribe who had never 
flown on an airplane until he came to west point he had only heard 
about water coming out of the walls but had never seen or taken a 
shower and had to be shown how to drink out of a soda can 
there is some culture shock especially in the beginning 
carrington says 
otherwise foreign cadets are not so different from american boys 
who grow up dreaming of going to west point 
in bangkok natee wongissares dreamed of becoming a west point 
cadet it was my life goal since i was 12 to get to west point 
he says since i saw a movie about eisenhower when he was a 
general i wanted to be just like him

editors note records were made to be broken but sometimes a 
bit of history fades with their passing such was the case when 
warren luhrs sailed from new york to san francisco in 80 days 20 
hours breaking a record that had stood since the era when clipper 
ships roamed the seas 
</TEXT>

when warren luhrs sailed into san francisco on lincolns birthday 
in his 60foot sloop thursdays child he killed the last living 
remnant of one of the nations most picturesque and romantic 
chapters the era of the clipper ships 
luhrs time of 80 days 20 hours from new york to san francisco 
beat a record that had stood since 1854 when millard fillmore had 
just turned over the white house to franklin pierce france had an 
emperor and the worlds first oil well was still five years away 
the old mark of 89 days eight hours had held off challengers for 
135 years it had been set by the clipper flying cloud a 
masterpiece of master shipbuilder donald mckay which was navigated 
by the skippers wife mrs josiah creesy with himself at the helm 
creesy his 40odd member crew and his passengers were in a rush 
because there was gold in california his cargo could fetch 1 an 
egg and 40 for a quart of whiskey 
clipper ships the greyhounds of the sea were built for speed 
anything fast in those days could be called a clipper clipper 
sleds clipper buggies 
mckay a native of nova scotia turned out swift sharpprowed 
and daringly overcanvased fliers at his yard in east boston there 
were to be 14 instances when a tall ship logged more than 400 miles 
in 24 hours ten were mckay creations including the fastest 
champion of the seas which once covered 465 miles in a days run 
flying cloud in fact broke her own record in 1854 three years 
earlier with her white and gold goddess figurehead cutting the 
waves flying cloud sped around the horn with eleanor creesy 
navigating past the rocks and through snow and gales to beat the old 
record by more than a week the crew who had blown out several 
topmasts under creesys iron rule that time was money and speed 
advertising of the finest kind promptly deserted for the gold 
fields 
the clipper era was actually shortlived and marked the last 
undisputed primacy of the american merchant marine american 
clippers in the opium trade to china set speed records all over the 
world their names were as glorious as the ships comet eagle wing 
westward ho sovereign of the seas young america sea witch sea 
witch sailed from hong kong to new york in 74 days 14 hours in 1849 
in getting to california pronto in the 1850s to pan gold in the 
sierras there was no lesser of evils overland there were indians 
and deserts and mountains transshipping across the isthmus of 
panama there were malaria and yellow fever around the horn there 
was the horn 
rounding the horn is like walking up a dark alley at midnight 
with the cape being the mugger rounding it east to west is 
particularly lifeshortening because the westerlies whirl unimpeded 
around the world goaded by incessant storms into some of the most 
awesome waves in the world a sailing vessel could spend a month 
battling gales to double the cape some gave up and turned around to 
sail to the orient via the cape of good hope at the tip of africa a 
speed merchant like the frostytempered creesy keeping his foot to 
the pedal only made the hazards greater 
the americans had another unsung hero matthew fontaine maury 
maury was a navy lieutenant who had been beached due to a leg 
injury so he was given a berth as superintendent of the sleepy 
department of charts and instruments 
he began collecting log books from as many voyages as he could 
find and gradually drew up charts of wind patterns and currents 
armed with these americans became briefly monarchs of the oceans 
the era didnt last because the civil war concentrated the nations 
energies away from the sea and because of the development of the 
ironclad steamboat mckays last clipper the glory of the seas 
launched in 1868 ended her days as a frozen fish warehouse 
about the only glory remaining were the old clipper records 
records and the seas have always conspired to lure mankind out of 
his easy chair the blue ribband for the fastest time was always a 
coveted trophy in the heyday of the transatlantic liners but 
yachtsmen if they ventured on the high seas at all usually endured 
cold wet and hunger until they reached distant ports at the other 
end 
joshua slocum another nova scotian became the first amateur to 
sail alone around the world at the turn of the century but with an 
old alarm clock as his navigational timepiece he was not intent on 
speed indeed he would freeload for months at a time en route at 
hospitable yacht clubs 
with transoceanic jets leaving few worlds to conquer however 
yachtsmen increasingly looked to old records to test their mettle 
sir francis chichester circled the globe with gypsy moth iv in 1966 
at age 66 in 226 days with only one stop three years later another 
englishman robin knoxjohnston who a psychiatrist said was 
distressingly normal before and afterward won a race around the 
world in 313 days to become the first nonstop solo 
circumnavigator another contestant a frenchman named bernard 
moitessier was winning on the home stretch he decided however he 
preferred his own solitary company at sea to that of his fellow 
humans ashore and sailed on for another half of the globe finally 
stopping in tahiti 
since then racing across large bodies of ocean alone or with 
crew has become commonplace it has become particularly appealing to 
frenchmen who excel at sailing highspeed multihull sailboats vast 
distances with occasional interruptions when the technology falls 
apart and sinks 
luhrs a rhode islander is also a transoceanic soloist as is 
dodge morgan a former journalist turned manufacturer now living in 
maine after setting a nonstop record around the globe of 150 days 
if luhrs record stands for another 135 years it wont be for 
lack of challengers even as he finished under the golden gate 
bridge two french persons phillipe monnet who left new york jan 
8 and anne liardet a 27yearold sailing with her fiance had 
already rounded the horn monnet reportedly hit an iceberg liardet 
was ahead of flying clouds time but behind luhrs 
luhrs said on arrival in san francisco once is enough this 
leaves eleanor creesy with some consolation she is the only 
navigator to have guided her husband around the horn to a record 
twice

editors note infertility is a problem among aging wildborn 
gorillas and few zoo gorillas were born in the wild by adapting a 
human artificial fertilization technique for use on wildborn 
gorillas scientists hope to expand the genetic pool and guard 
against inbreeding 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
becky and mimbo have the same 
problems as many infertile couples but theirs have greater 
ramifications they represent a possible threat to their species 
infertility among aging wildborn gorillas prompted specialists 
to adapt a human artificial fertilization technique for use on 
becky a lowland gorilla at the cheyenne mountain zoo in colorado 
springs 
the hope is to have a diverse genetic pool so the gorillas 
dont become inbred by managing the population to the maximum 
genetic representation of all captive gorillas says dr paul 
calle cheyenne mountain zoo veterinarian 
if three of 10 gorillas are responsible for 80 percent of the 
offspring the contribution of the others get lost over time 
estimates by experts on the wild gorilla population range from 
10000 to 70000 
only 15 percent to 20 percent of the 297 captive gorillas in 
north america are wildborn or of the foundation stock for carrying 
on the bloodline experts say many of them are reaching the end of 
their reproductive years 
such is the case with becky 32 and mimbo 26 who have just one 
surviving offspring 
the denver and cheyenne mountain zoos are working under a 
twoyear grant from the institute of museum services last 
september they assembled a team including zoo veterinarians an 
infertility specialist and a reproductive physiologist to perform 
gamete intrafallopian transfer gift on becky it was the first 
reproductive procedure ever tried on a gorilla according to dr 
richard cambre a denver zoo veterinarian 
becky did not become pregnant but the surgery did provide 
information on the gorillas reproductive system that could increase 
the chances for success when she undergoes the procedure again 
similarities in the reproductive systems of humans and gorillas 
make gorillas likely candidates for artificial fertilization 
techniques such as gift says dr william yee a university of 
california at irvine infertility specialist who performed beckys 
surgery 
we learned that like in humans gorillas respond 
differently yee says it seemed beckys eggs were not mature 
enough 
in the normal process of reproduction after the egg is 
released the fallopian tube picks up the egg from the ovary inside 
the fallopian tube is where fertilization occurs 
with gamete intrafallopian transfer were placing the eggs and 
sperm inside the tube so when were finished were assured the egg 
and sperm are present in the spot where fertilization occurs 
gift has a live birthrate of 25 percent among women compared 
with 17 percent with invitro fertilization he says 
similar efforts have been made at the dallas zoo where three 
gorillas have undergone unsuccessful reproductive surgeries 
following beckys says naida loskutoff a phd candidate at texas 
aampm who participated in beckys procedure 
eggs were collected for future artificial inseminations from a 
32yearold and a 17yearold physically unable to bear offspring 
the third like becky an infertile female in her 30s was 
artifically inseminated loskutoff says 
conservationists find the prospect of apparently infertile 
gorillas producing offspring encouraging for the species future 
in cases where a species exists only in captivity often because 
of habitat destruction zoos have crossed the line from 
entertainment to conservation to ensure the species survival 
cambre says 
the goal in such cases is to return the species to the wild once 
survival can be ensured he says 
their numbers dont place lowland gorillas among the most 
endangered species but they are among the biggest draws to zoos 
experts say their popularity has increased since the recent film 
gorillas in the mist which depicts dian fosseys work with the 
more severely endangered mountain gorilla 
if you sit and watch a family of gorillas you see a little 
insight to human behavior says lester fisher coordinator of the 
species survival plan gorilla committee based at chicagos lincoln 
park zoo 
natural breeding among captive gorilla groups is preferred over 
surgical procedures and fisher says the natural method is proving 
increasingly successful especially among larger zoo populations 
our breeding program in our north american ssp has definitely 
turned the corner fisher says 
to that end the ssp committee for lowland gorillas documents the 
family trees of captive gorillas in north america and monitors 
interzoo transfers of the animals to avoid inbreeding and the 
subsequent loss of genetic diversity 
genetic diversity means the animals carry a variety of genes 
representing a crosssection of the population fisher says in 
the wild if you have normal groups you would have total genetic 
diversity 
since we are no longer taking the animal from the wild we are 
dealing with a captive population and we have to look at a bigger 
picture so we can look specifically at the problems of managing 
husbandry and reproduction

the paradox that is grace shes in a very serious environment 
she feels safest when shes at work shes most insecure when shes 
away from that environment dey says 
i like her best in a dilemma when the crisis comes in a 
dramatic or comedic conflict she has a vulnerability in a conflict 
shes really a powerful woman shes strong when something gets to 
her its wonderful she gets frustrated she can be outwitted 
because shes so serious her determination boxes her in 
makeup artists lee mitchell and candy conery work on her face for 
the next scene then sarah her 10yearold enters the trailer 
booboos here dey exclaims jumping off the high makeup chair 
to hug her 
sarah is from a previous marriage dey is now married to 
television producer bernard sofronski 
van owen isnt known for doing things on impulse but on a show 
early this year she did suddenly kiss victor sifuentes jimmy smits 
nothings come of that yet says dey for us the moment 
was so wonderful for grace to fulfill this fantasy but theres no 
talk that anything will come of it steven bochco said it was just 
something grace has always wanted to do 
that was one of the few times i got to work with other members 
of the cast besides harry im usually in court it was a new 
experience and it was fun too im kind of lucky theres a lot of 
give and take i work the long hours in the courtroom which makes 
you kind of crazy but i get to work with all these wonderful guest 
stars 
she was not in the la law pilot but was cast after running 
into executive producer bochco at a school function for their 
children bochco was looking for a love interest for kuzak as well 
as another view of the law 
dey says she spent about a month in court with a deputy public 
defender researching an earlier role for another pilot she used 
that as background for the character of van owen 
the daughter of a newspaper editor from upstate new york dey had 
done commercials and modeling before making her debut as laurie in 
the partridge family in 1970 the show starring shirley jones 
and david cassidy was about a singing family 
it was pure luck that i got the partridge family says dey 
i thought i was an adult i was 16 when i did the pilot and 17 
when we started the show i was 21 when we finished 
her next series was loves me loves me not a romantic comedy 
costarring kenneth gilman that lasted only a few weeks in 1977 she 
was also in the shortlived cbs primetime soap opera emerald

acting in the comedy cafe crown at 
broadways brooks atkinson theater is like being in a musical 
without having to sing says anne jackson 
its such a joyous play to do there are 18 actors its an 
ensemble piece audiences seem to have a really good time 
eli wallach anne jacksons husband of 41 years plays flamboyant 
impresarioactor david cole in cafe crown his actress wife 
plays his actress wife 
cafe crown is a revival of hy krafts 1942 comedy which was 
the first broadway success for director elia kazan its set in the 
real cafe royal which opened in 1920 amid 80 yiddish theaters a 
haven for dealmaking actors and eccentric waiters 
wallachs character is fighting to keep yiddish theater alive 
another character a gifted young actor based on paul muni wants to 
leave the yiddish theater for hollywood 
remember those ads you dont have to be jewish to like levys 
rye bread wallach says you dont have to be jewish to enjoy 
cafe crown 
its a family play wellplotted the play reflects hy krafts 
personality there is no meanness in it no discomfort 
the decline of the yiddish theater was based on the fact that 
young people didnt want to learn yiddish wallach adds i 
didnt learn it when my parents argued they spoke polish german 
or yiddish 
wallachs most difficult acting in cafe crown is telling the 
young actor hell release him from his contract giving him a chance 
at hollywood its a very moving thing to me wallach says i 
say what right have i to demand your sacrifice one generation is 
saying to another we must move onits in only two lines in 
acting you just have to go along with the notes like music 
the couple has acted together in murray schisgals the typist 
and the tiger luv and twice around the park 
cafe crown opened in october offbroadway at the public 
theater a hit it moved to broadway feb 18 fyvush finkel and 
felix fibich both veterans of yiddish theater are in the cast so 
is bob dishy 
wallach turned down a film to do the broadway run the movie 
was interesting but i love doing the play he says i didnt 
want to go to germany for two months id rather spend it on 
broadway 
in 1953 he turned down the role of maggio which then went to 
frank sinatra in the film from here to eternity he says it 
was the choice between that or a brilliant play by tennessee 
williams camino real where hed tailored a role for me kazan 
was directing it wasnt an act of heroism it was a choice 
im a contented actor i read of actors making 800000 im 
happy doing what im doing 
once the ego drive to be in the limelight to make a killing 
to be the biggest flattens out you begin to relish the work for 
the work 
we paid our dues in the theater says wallach we spent 
years working with great stars learning from the ground up we were 
bequeathed certain values in the theater that are important to us 
so when we find projects we want to do we do them 
miss jackson is writing a second book her first early 
stages ends with the birth of the couples son now a married 
father of two little boys whos working on special effects on star 
trek 5 the couples two daughters are actresses one married one 
getting married in may 
though they also act independently miss jackson says we do 
have a lot of fun working together were both quite good character 
actors the characterizations that we come up with make it seem like 
its a different person were relating to 
wallachs acting in cafe crown changes he says depending on 
what bob dishy does as the legendary cafe royal busboy i never 
know if hes going to be polite or irascible theres a little 
mystery in his acting which is why hes always interesting 
the rather small part of mrs cole originally didnt appeal to 
miss jackson i thought they just wanted me because of eli when i 
got involved in it i realized it was better than i thought she 
says 
her role is very important in cafe crown says wallach 
they talk about her before she comes on she has one scene with me 
and one scene in the final act its really not much but its so 
carefully woven into the fabric of the play that the character 
emerges very strongly 
it was a surprise to me the actress says and its fun to 
play 
one day during the offbroadway run miss jackson climbed on a 
chair in their apartment fell and missed four performances wallach 
opens his mouth to comment on her understudy hears be careful 
what you say about how good she was from his spouse and says 
mildly i was happy when you came back

once a place only for the penguin adventurer and 
the scientist antarctica now is attracting the tourist and casual 
visitor increasing the danger to earths last pristine environment 
an associated press correspondent traveled to the frozen continent 
recently and this is what he found 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like a monument to the end of 
antarcticas age of innocence the bahia paraisos badly gashed 
orange hull rises out of iceblue waters 
penguins calmly perch atop the overturned vessel unaware of the 
danger in thin oily sheen in the water around them most of the tens 
of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that spilled out in the 
shipwreck jan 28 has since evaporated but more is slowly leaking 
times are changing at earths last frontier 
countries eager to stake or reinforce their claims to a slice of 
the frozen continent are dispatching ships and aircraft bulldozers 
and amphibious trucks with nationalistic fanfare they are building 
new bases and launching new research projects 
during the austral summer wellheeled tourists arrive by the 
hundreds each week on cruise ships supply vessels or military 
transport planes contracted by specilized travel agencies even 
private yachts and polar skiing expeditions are venturing into the 
last place on earth where no passport is needed 
accidents are happening and in the case of the bahia paraiso 
antarctic wildlife paid the price a host of legal environmental 
and highly political questions are surging up like the hazardous 
icebergs in antarcticas poorly charted seas 
youre confronted daily with an everhastening chain of 
events peter wilkniss polar programs chief for the 
washingtonbased national science foundation told a visiting 
associated press correspondent at palmer station the foundation 
directs all us research in antarctica 
wilkniss advocates increased international regulation 
theres nothing that prevents anyone from doing anything they 
want he said i dont think we can live with that situation 
he described the continents 51 million square miles as a 
judicial nomans land 
no laws apply to antarctica because no one owns it according to 
the terms of the antarctic treaty the pact was signed in 1961 by 12 
countries who agreed to put all territorial claims on hold for at 
least 30 years and reserve antarctica for peaceful research 
eight other nations since have joined the treaty with full voting 
powers while an additional 18 have agreed to abide by its 
provisions and hold observer status the treaty nations meet about 
every two years 
the organization recently drafted a plan to permit strictly 
regulated exploration and exploitation of the continents mineral 
resources after 1991 when the treaty itself is up for review 
but it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as the 
proliferation of bases marine and air safety indemnification and 
medical and rescue facilities 
the wreck of the bahia paraiso exemplifies the regions 
predicament 
the 435foot supply and research vessel operated by the 
argentine navy called on palmer station in glacierrimmed arthur 
bay on jan 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around 
it also carried a crew of 235 
on its way out of the bay it ran aground in a passage marked on 
sea charts as containing danger ledges and pinnacles crew and 
passengers got off safely in lifeboats and found shelter at the 
station 
the ship over a period of four days gradually rolled over and 
sank about 180000 gallons of diesel oil from its storage tanks 
spilled into the water 
during the austral summer season more than 30 cruises were 
scheduled to call on palmer bringing an average 100 tourists on 
each occasion 
tourism is uncontrolled and to some out of control 
in 1982 we got three cruise ships all season said bruce 
carter of ittantarctic services which is contracted to supply and 
maintain palmer station this year we got as many as five a week 
wed sometimes get two in one day 
the science foundation briefly tried to ban tourist visits last 
year arguing that it interfered with research but the ban was 
lifted when influential americans complained claiming a right to 
see how their tax dollars are being spent the bahia paraisos 
tourists included 46 americans who paid from 3000 to nearly 7000 
for the cruise 
the stations staff includes a medical corpsman with a small 
oneroom clinic for treating the two to four dozen people at the 
base it is not designed for handling a maritime disaster

<TEXT>
and station workers said only fair weather prevented a disaster 
they said most of the bahia paraisos lifeboats were open 
inflatable rafts without oars or motors the day was calm and they 
could be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty but 
they could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatile 
antarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse the workers said 
in response to the diesel spill the national science foundation 
dispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tons 
of specialized equipment the mission cost more than 2 million the 
chilean and argentine navies also sent costly cleanup missions 
the cleanup ended in midmarch although the bahia paraiso still 
holds about 63000 gallons that cant be safely reached and pumped 
out it could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm or 
simply seep out for many months as the wreck gradually 
disintegrates experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreck 
away 
the area of the spill teems with wildlife including penguins 
skuas cormorants arctic terns and other birds seals and whales 
frequently pass through the bay 
scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that many 
penguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill but they have 
been unable to determine the extent of the damage a special team of 
15 researchers from the united states argentina and chile has 
arrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spills environmental 
impact it will take years to complete 
yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made since the 
united states has no property rights to the area at or around palmer 
station it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation the area 
of the accident on the antarctic peninsula is claimed by chile 
argentina and great britain 
chile recently announced plans to propose at the next antarctic 
treaty meeting in paris in october an article to hold each country 
financially responsible for environmental or other damage the 
science foundation plans to press for agreement on cost sharing in 
cleanup of spills and other accidents and for formation of an 
international coordinating office for emergencies 
but there could be some opposition 
we must act with prudence without falling into decisions that 
could be a little hasty said roberto daverede head of antarctic 
affairs for the argentine foreign ministry argentina claims a thick 
wedge of the continent and like the other claimant nations rejects 
any foreign or international jurisdiction 
daverede played down the effects of the bahia paraiso spill 
this is far from being a natural catastrophe he said he 
called the wreck an isolated incident 
nonetheless less than a month after the bahia paraiso accident a 
peruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away near king george 
island the vessel called the humboldt and touted as the flagship 
of perus territorial claim also spilled some diesel fuel but was 
soon refloated 
by world standards neither accident would qualify as a major 
environmental disaster 
ive walked away from bigger diesel spills than this where 
nothing died absolutely nothing said jim obrien of gretna la 
a pollution control expert hired by the us government for the 
bahia paraiso cleanup 
but there is special concern that antarcticas environment may be 
especially fragile theres also a growing belief that its huge cold 
mass plays a key role in longterm global weather patterns 
there also are some indications that the strain on the local 
environment may be straining political relations 
for decades a unique spirit of international friendship and 
cooperation has reigned in antarctica political conficts were left 
at the doorstep and missions from such idealogically distinct 
countries as the soviet union and rightwing chile lived as 
nextdoor neighbors sharing supplies equipment and a drink or two 
on the cold nights 
in early march however the chileans criticized what they called 
the poor waste handling at the soviet bellinghousen base literally 
a stones from their own marsh base on king george island they said 
they would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting

for two decades scientists 
enjoyed a cloistered existence at this us research center 
studying wildlife in conditions as unspoiled as anywhere in the 
world 
no longer 
the mission of palmer station perched on a gravelly point 
beneath a towering glacier changed overnight when the argentine 
supply ship bahia paraiso ran aground jan 28 and spilled its cargo 
of diesel fuel just offshore 
this is changing from a place where people studied untouched 
nature longterm to a place where people study the effects of an oil 
spill longterm said margaret rubega an ornithologist from the 
university of californiairvine she was studying skuas and kelp 
gulls at the station when the wreck occurred 
as an ecosystem that was basically undisturbed its a horrible 
loss really its tragic miss rubega said 
william fraser an ornithologist from the point reyes calif 
bird observatory said there already are indications of some 
poisoning of penguins skuas cormorants and other bird species that 
populate the rocky islands around the spill 
we have no direct evidence of heavy mortality but we have 
indirect evidence he said 
scavanging giant petrels who live on the rocky islands around the 
base were feeding their newborn chicks an unusually rich diet of 
penguin meat after the spill fraser said 
what this means is you had large numbers of penguins dying 
locally 
in addition 726 pairs of polar skuas were nesting in the area 
when the spill occurred 
every single one lost their chicks frazer said 
he stressed that the evidence was not conclusive a team of 15 
us scientists has just begun more comprehensive studies 
ironically the site offers an excellent base of information for 
a beforeandafter examination of a spill the wealth of data on 
bird and marine life collected since the station went into operation 
can be used for comparison fraser said 
its a terrible disaster but its an incredible natural 
experiment

aboard the r ship captain grant 
philpott says a chill runs through him every time he passes sail 
rock 
the 91foot pinnacle rises out of waters 700 feet deep like a 
sailors bad dream 
you get to wondering how many others are lying just under the 
water philpott said 
according to antarctic sea charts plenty of them are on the 
jagged bottom at sail rock near deception island ready to rip 
through the strongest of hulls like the reinforced one of the polar 
duke a modern us research ship 
but even the charts cant be trusted they are loaded with 
hazards marked pa position approximate and ed existence 
doubtful some areas have never been sounded 
theres a lot of old data being used philpott said 
throw in roving icebergs as tall as highrise buildings and 
sudden storms with winds up to 90 knots or more and youve got a 
place where even the bestrun ship may well bump into something 
sooner or later 
the 219foot polar duke has stateoftheart navigational 
equipment including two radars two depth sounders and a sitescan 
sonar nonetheless it ran into uncharted shoals two years ago and 
put a 1million dent in the hull 
a british icebreaker the endurance hit an iceberg earlier this 
year and still had a patched hull when it came to the assistance of 
a grounded peruvian research ship the humboldt in late february 
philpott said he grew up on the ice of his native 
newfoundland in canada and has navigated in antarctica since 1985 
experience is essential he said 
but the increasing number of ships plying the antarctic coast is 
raising questions about the judgment of some crews when the 
argentine research vessel bahia paraiso wrecked on shoals jan 28 
it was attempting to cruise through an area marked on sea charts 
with the warning dangerous ledges and pinnacles 
once upon a time a ship in these waters sailed virtually alone 
on a recent 8500mile expedition however the chilean ship 
capitan alcazar reported sighting 27 other vessels including two 
private yachts and three tourist cruise ships from a host of 
countries from singapore to spain 
more traffic is expected to produce more mishaps but according 
to philpott theres a saving grace it also means more ships to come 
to your rescue 
the biggest danger is the lack of other ships if you do get in 
trouble he said

here are some facts and figures about antarctica 
history britains capt james cook is believed to have first 
entered antarctic waters during an expedition in 177375 and he was 
followed by several other mariners who discovered land there in the 
early 1800s the american capt charles wilkes first identified it 
as a continent in 1840 when he traced 1500 miles of coastline the 
first inland expeditions were carried out by norways leonard 
kristensen and britains robert f scott and ernest shackleton in 
the late 1800s and early 1900s roald amundsen of norway reached the 
south pole in december 1911 and scott arrived a month later but his

rounded cap of ice more than a mile deep in some places the total 
volume of ice on the continent is equivalent to 72 percent of all 
water on earth the continent is divided by the transantarctic

an ambitious experiment to allow chinese to 
own their homes has halted in this seaside city because of 
complaints from powerful officials and austerity policies in beijing 
other experiments in housing reform throughout china are also off 
to a slow start due to the skyhigh price of living space and lack 
of confidence in the government 
the policies are in contradiction we dont know what the 
future holds said qin shiyu a housing reform official in yantai 
a breezy town in shandong province on the bohai sea 
in beijing apartments cost the equivalent of about 45 a square 
foot meaning that an average college graduate would have to save 
his total income for 70 years to buy a basic threeroom flat 
in crowded shanghai prices can be even higher 
a recent report by the official xinhua news agency said living 
space per person in a shanghai neighborhood amounted to nine by nine 
feet or 54 square feet 
and thats only for the relatively well off it said 
thousands it said were living in 216 square feet of space 
in yantai prices have been more reasonable and 1600 homes have 
been sold in about two years but 16000 families are still waiting 
for a chance to buy 
yu bingmo a worker at the yantai general synthetic leather 
factory was lucky 
in october he scraped together his life savings took out a loan 
and bought his threeroom 600squarefoot apartment or about 30 
feet by 20 feet for about 12000 yuan 3243 
it may mean a few more years of lousy cigarettes but i was 
willing to take the risk said yu 57 as he sat with his wife in 
the living room its not a palace but at least its mine 
china began housing reform in the mid1980s in an attempt to 
correct a serious housing shortage that had left millions of chinese 
urban dwellers with nowhere to live 
the plan picked up urgency over the past few years as part of 
chinas effort to reform its heavily subsidized housing system 
in chinas countryside houses are privately owned and passed 
from generation to generation but in the cities home to 40 percent 
of the countrys 11 billion people housing has been built and 
maintained by state funds and rented at rockbottom prices 
chinas housing industry is a welfare undertaking making no 
profits at all said a recent edition of the beijing review 
china also looked at private housing as a way to channel peoples 
money into the countrys infrastructure and halt spending on 
consumer goods they reasoned that less consumer spending would 
limit record high inflation of around 30 percent 
in addition reformers wanted to battle corrupt officials who use 
their power to secure bigger and better apartments for themselves 
and their friends 
in 1986 yantai and three other cities were selected as the first 
group of pilot cities for urban housing reform 
in yantai rent was raised almost 2000 percent to 124 yuan a 
square meter 3 cents a square foot to chinese accustomed to 
paying around 3 percent of their salaries for rent the jump was 
substantial 
next the housing department ordered businesses in the city to 
add a subsidy of 235 percent of each workers salary to his 
paycheck to make up for the rent increase 
as rent payments to work units increased the state cut the 
amount it gave them for housing residents were also made 
responsible for the upkeep of their homes 
youve got a broken toilet well fix it yourself said wang 
qingyuan head of the real estate management office in yantai the 
end result is that people are being made more responsible for their 
lives 
workers were encouraged to buy their houses at cutrate prices 
onetenth to onefifth of the market rate special low or 
nointerest loans were offered 
to discourage speculation resale was permitted only after five 
years 
the sales pace was quick 
but chinas economy was overheating to cut spending the state 
council chinas cabinet ordered all money received in the sales of 
housing frozen in bank accounts for two years and the ministry of 
finance clamped a 40 percent tax on those funds 
other problems were brewing 
yantai known for its clean air and fresh fish is a retirement 
area for some of chinas most powerful former officials when rents 
went up they complained some went on rent strikes others used 
connections to avoid paying 
the effect on yantais reform was deadening work units which 
own all the housing stopped selling a halt in sales meant housing 
construction stopped 
we were like a truck moving downhill and then somebody slammed 
on the brakes said one official it was a pretty big shock 
other cities like beijing and shanghai have also begun housing 
reform but to them it only means putting a few houses on the market 
their success has been even less notable than yantais 
because housing prices are so high and no attempts have been made 
to change the rent system only successful individual businessmen 
still a rarity in china are able to afford their own home 
on a recent afternoon sun xiaofeng a cab driver who makes 300 
yuan 81 a month a good deal by chinese standards strolled into 
the beijing real estate exchange 
im just curious he said ill never be able to buy a 
house not in 10000 years

slaves of new york 
 
the film production team of ismail merchant and james ivory has 
specialized in literary adapations creating such cinematic jewels 
as a room with a view maurice and the bostonians all 
three movies had their bases in works with rich backdrops and meaty 
characters 
now theyve used their production and directorial skills in 
trying to turn a hunk of coal into a diamond unfortunately 
slaves of new york doesnt glitter its still a rough dark 
lump 
slaves of new york is also a meandering melange of 
superficialites it was written by tama janowitz who also wrote the 
book of short stories from which it was adapted both are shallow 
works there is no flesh and not even an interesting skeleton upon 
which to fashion a story that will grab us inspire us make us feel 
something or just entertain us 
the action such as it is takes place in the selfabsorbed and 
limited downtown art world an environment that works hard at 
causing narcolepsy 
eleanor bernadette peters a copyreader at an east village 
newspaper is an artsy type she designs outrageous hats she also 
is massively insecure and doesnt think she measures up to her 
bohemian friends she lives with a pseudoartist named stash adam 
coleman howard who dots the world with all those cookie cutter 
cartoons and graffitilike drawings the downtown world calls art 
the miserably highstrung stash is having an affair with daria 
madeleine potter whos having an affair with marley nick corri 
slaves of new york is bernadette peters first movie role 
since 1981s pennies from heaven since then shes gone on to 
greater glory on broadway receiving a tony award from her 
performance as dot in stephen sondheims sunday in the park with 
george and starring in song and dance and into the woods 
she is terribly miscast in slaves of new york and her 
talents largely go unused 
mary beth hurt is wonderful as an acidic art dealer but we see 
too little of her ditto tammy grimes as georgette 
ivorys direction lacks heart he just doesnt seem to like what 
hes doing or even understand it but then again janowitz hasnt 
given him very much material too much of the movie seems like guess 
work and hence incomplete 
slaves of new york was produced by ismail merchant and gary 
hendler and is released by tristar pictures this film is rated r

moon over parador mca home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
the farce moon over parador is better than it seems at first 
but its nowhere near as good as it could be with paul mazursky as 
director and actors richard dreyfuss sonia braga and raul julia 
its a little like tootsie goes bananas 
dreyfuss who puts in a very good performance plays an ambitious 
actor in search of a really meaty role he inadvertently finds it 
when he is kidnapped to fill in when the dictator of a caribbean 
country parador where hed been at work on a film dies julia is 
the evil police chief the power behind the power braga who had 
been the dictators mistress takes dreyfuss on and gets him to do 
some good in her country 
but underneath it all the movie is about acting and entertaining 
jonathan winters fernando rey sammy davis jr ed asner dick 
cavett and ike pappas make appearances julias character educated 
at harvard university talks about wayne newton and lou grant and is 
fascinated with acting and movie making 
in parador dreyfuss character gets a copy of the sunday new 
york times and reads about acting opportunities dreyfuss and braga 
perform for an applauding crowd of paradorans at a beach by 
smooching as dictator dreyfuss recreates a scene in which the real 
dictator visited the shooting of a film in parador and mazursky 
himself appears crossdressing as the late dictators mother 
and finally when drefuss leaves parador to return to the new 
york city acting scene he left he bids farewell to braga in what he 
exclaims to be a moment right out of casablanca 
but for all the attention to acting many of the lines leave much 
to be desired and simply fall flat when the dictator passes out 
drunk julia looks at him and says he cant drink anymore his 
liver is totally damaged 
still there is much in the movie that is witty and fun

pg 
 
a summer to remember does have tess harper a cute orangutan 
and a couple of kids who triumph over adults but it is so syrupy 
that its hard to swallow 
the film directed by robert lewis is about a deaf boy sean 
gerlis who feels isolated and extremely angry after his dad leaves 
him and his mother harper and sister his stepfather james 
farentino tries desperately to reach him and break him from his 
shell 
but what it takes to bring him out is an unlikely relationship he 
and his sister develop with an escaped ape who has been trained to 
speak in sign language its a clever idea and the acting is fine 
also in the cast are louise fletcher burt young and bridgette 
andersen 
the movie deals well with the difficulties that can develop 
between a stepfather and stepson and with the way the world can 
seem to a deaf boy

especially heavyhanded are the music and and a slowmotion scene in

born to burn mca ethel and the shameless hussies 
 
ethel and the shameless hussies working at some lonesome 
intersection where the andrews sisters meet bob wills are really a 
lot more talented than the dopey names and outrageous outfits would 
have you believe in fact thats the problem here the joke 
quickly wears thin pulling down what could be a real upandcoming 
country band with a difference 
ethel and her polyester pals bunni and blanche we 
are led to believe are three good ol gals who were all married to 
the same lout they sing clever things i thought he was mr 
right but he left and wear a lot of animal prints and 
seminaughty corsets 
but amid the schlock there is some quality their singing is 
right on the mark and their sound leans to texas swing the rebirth 
of which is the happiest country music trend in a long time in real 
life ethel even comes with credentials shes actually the 
songwriter kacey jones who cowrote the mickey gilley hit im the 
one mama warned you about which is reprised on born to burn 
these women though face a big decision is this a country band 
or a vaudeville act the gimmick that got them their big break is 
going to turn them into the buster poindexter of campw if thy dont 
find a way out real fast

mystery girl virgin roy orbison 
 
roy orbisons sudden death last december makes it hard to 
objectively consider this comeback album is it really good or 
does sentimentality make it seem so 
its really good not perfect but it would have been a hit even 
if orbison hadnt succumbed to a heart attack 
orbison imports an allstar crew to help him including george 
harrison tom petty and most of his heartbreakers bono and the edge 
of u2 jeff lynne elvis costello steve cropper and a host of 
studio stars all orbison needed to bring was that sweet 
otherworldly voice 
you got it the single is successful for the same reason as 
the traveling wilburys its light breezy feel good pop 
but the meat of the album are the bono and edgecomposed shes 
a mystery to me and costellos the comedians the spare 
arrangement of the former lays bare a tale of romantic torment 
the comedians adds a bizarre new twist to romantic loss the 
narrator is left stuck on the top of a ferris wheel while his 
girlfriend walks off holding the operators hand the song builds to 
a dramatic climax before orbison leaves the listener like himself 
hanging in midair 
each of the albums 10 songs go down easily with only all i 
can do is dream you having much of a rock n roll kick 
that eventually becomes a problem songs such as a love so 
beautiful windsurfer and the only one are predictable and 
tend to blend together after awhile orbison was successful when he 
tackled challenging material he should have tried it a few more 
times 
still this rock n roll hall of fame member managed to thrust 
himself onto the contemporary scene without looking foolish that 
happens less often than it seems

lieder by franz schubert kathleen battle soprano james levine 
piano deutsche grammaphon 
 
kathleen battle and james levine present a varied selection of 
schubert songs spanning a broad emotional range in the first half 
battle sings mostly about the sunnier side of love her light 
supple voice is perfectly suited to schuberts setting of goethes 
liebhaber in allen gestalten with its repeated line would 
that i were a fish so nimble and agile those words nicely sum up 
battles fine voice 
her instrument changes color for the interesting an die 
laute in which a young man confides his love to a lute levine 
whose pianism is as welcome as his podium work perfectly 
approximates the sound of the lute in the accompaniment 
this recording amply demonstrates that battle does not lack for 
charm and does not hesitate to show it the listener is won over on 
the eighth track a hauntingly beautiful lullaby called nacht und 
traume she sings softly throughout with a heartaching sweetness 
the song is about the joy men take in their dreams and ends with a 
depressing conclusion a call for a return to sleep when day breaks 
the program now takes a darker turn battle sings of aching 
hearts in rastlose liebe or restless love and the 
turbulent night of a young nun awaiting her saviour like a trembling 
bride in die junge nonne finally comes the wondrous shepherd 
on the rock which transverses the range of a lovers emotions 
yearning grief loneliness longing and the joy of anticipation 
to some tastes this song is better for a deeper voice and 
battle has trouble with some of the low notes but she sings with 
conviction and attention to detail clarinettist karl leister is 
flawless sounding like a cool mountain stream bubbling over 
polished rocks

the land that was to become the state of 
oklahoma was a patchwork of indian nations and unassigned territory 
surrounded by a maturing frontier 100 years ago 
but that all changed with the roar of a cannon on april 22 1889 
signaling the start of the first of the great land runs that would 
open millions of acres to white settlement 
as many as 40000 people participated in the run of 89 each 
hoping to stake a claim to 160 acres of land or a lot in a 
designated townsite the 2millionacre rectangle later would form 
parts of six central oklahoma counties 
reenactments of the run and related observances are scheduled as 
part of a statewide centennial this spring state officials say the 
focus on the states frontier heritage should draw an additional 1 
million visitors during 1989 
fort reno west of el reno will be the site of one of the largest 
reenactments the fort reno and indian territory days 
observance will draw up to 500 reenactors in military civilian and 
indian dress to an encampment april 15 and 16 organizers say 
after the fort reno event a cavalry unit will spend three days 
riding 54 miles to guthrie just as soldiers did in 1889 when they 
policed crowds gathering for the land run the largest reenactments 
of the run are scheduled as spectator participation events in 
guthrie april 22 
according to state tourism officials other centennial 
reenactments will be in oklahoma city april 89 lawton may 2021 
pawnee and fort gibson may 27 yukon june 811 norman july 2123 
ponca city sept 16 fountainhead state park sept 30 salina oct 
7 lawton oct 2930 and in oologah nov 11 
whit edwards coordinator of the living history program for the 
oklahoma tourism and recreation department said he hopes 
participants gain a better understanding of what life was like in 
1889 through the reenactments 
they can actually feel and touch a little bit of history 
whether its in the foods or the clothing edwards said its a 
lot more human feeling than reading it out of a book 
indian tribes routed from their homelands in other parts of the 
country had been moved to oklahoma for decades before the land run 
oklahoma comes from a choctaw phrase meaning home of the red 
people 
but when many indians sided with the confederacy during the civil 
war it gave the federal government the rationale it needed to begin 
taking land away from the tribes says stan hoig a retired central 
state university professor who has written 10 books about oklahoma 
history 
a decade before the run of 89 railroad interests and socalled 
boomer groups began lobbying congress for the land to be opened 
for settlement 
president benjamin harrison used the land run approach 
apparently because he was familiar with smaller runs used in 
illinois and indiana hoig says 
homesteaders made the run on foot on horseback by wagon and 
even bicycle although it was used four more times to settle 
oklahoma land hoig says it was a poor system 
i would say there was very little fair about it hoig says 
it was an exercise in american enterprise everybody had his own 
way of beating the game 
often settlers would sneak into the area to be claimed hours or 
days in advance to scout out desirable land when the run started 
these sooners would emerge from the brush to stake their claims 
before legitimate racers 
sooners became the nickname for oklahomans 
oklahomas territory days ended in 1907 when it became the 46th 
state

relatives he says he feels related this way to some of the indians 
he has met and worked with

are a people of the 1990s as well as a people of the 1860s with 
the same inherent faults and virtues as the rest of us

the pot of gold may remain elusive but here the 
rainbow is back in the sky 
the rainbow room of beloved memories the first really big date 
the celebration of certain wedding anniversaries and birthdays the 
one goforbroke dinner on that vacation in new york is operating 
again recalling bygone days 
as the song says theyve put it back the way it was when 
it opened in 1934 as the epitome of elegance on the 65th floor of 
the art deco rca building at 30 rockefeller center 
the rainbow room has never been updated but joseph baum whose 
company now leases the two floors of the rainbow complex says that 
changes had crept in all of us make little changes suddenly they 
become big changes 
the rainbow room which has spectacular views of the manhattan 
skyline and a revolving dance floor reopened in december 1987 after 
a twoyear 20 million renovationit was completely rebuilt down 
to the steel every square inch refurbished put back to be in 
perfect condition says baum 
renovation became complete this year with the opening of a cozy 
cabaret named rainbow and stars 
baum who likes to talk about an ambiance of dine dance and 
romance says that the rainbow room now has alternating dance 
bands and its circular wooden dance floor revolves again it 
hadnt been used for years he says 
what isnt in the rainbow room that was at its opening 55 years 
ago is the color organ it shot lights in the colors of the 
rainbow onto the ceilings white dome and crystal chandelier 
depending on what notes were played and gave the rainbow room its 
name 
the rainbow theme updated is carried out in rainbow and 
stars the long interior wall is dotted with tiny lights the 
stars periodically the stars disappear and the wall becomes curved 
rows of rainbow colors i think what we have is what rainbow 
stands for says baum history memory and the energy of today 
baum says the whole idea of rainbow is again to be showing the 
world what it means to be a new yorker and those who want to be new 
yorkers for a short time how to enjoy seduction and celebration 
waving at the view he adds this is your town expressing all its 
possibilities people dress up we have 30 to 40 percent every night 
in black tie 
rainbow and stars is on the north side of the rca buildings 65th 
floor and a bar rainbow promenade is on the south 
on the west where the ellington band formerly swung two 
engagements a year in the rainbow grill the room is renamed rainbow 
pavilion and is rented for private parties the entire floor is a 
private luncheon club on weekdays the rainbow room is open to the 
public for brunch on sundays 
baum says the average food check in the rainbow room is around 
50 for food per person drinks tax tips and a 15 music charge 
take it higher 
dinner prices in rainbow amp stars are comparable with an 
entertainment charge usually at 35 per person

when it comes to deciding what to do for a vacation this year 
many travel consultants are of the opinion that some 3 million 
americans cant be wrong 
thats the number of us travelers expected to take cruises in 
1989 
the choice of itinerary ranges from a 25cent ride on the 
manhattanstaten island ferry round trip to a roundtheworld trip 
in a penthouse splitlevel suite aboard the queen elizabeth 2 at 
360000 each double occupancy 
for travelers lured by faraway places with strangesounding names 
theres a cornucopia of adventurous cruises offered vacationers this 
season 
for example 
an amazon river expedition that includes fishing for piranhas 
that later become a luncheon treat 
a visit to the galapagos islands described by charles darwin 
as a living laboratory of evolution where he formulated his 
origin of species in 1835 
siberian river cruises led by sir fitzroy maclean a noted 
soviet expert from great britain 
a trip aboard what is billed as the first and only luxury ship 
to cruise chinas yangtse river 
indepth luxury cruises in the baltic sea and gulf of bothnia 
despite the millions of cruising americans each year travel 
experts say less than 10 percent of us vacationers have discovered 
cruising 
but because of an expected increase in popularity more ships are 
being constructed according to douglas ward executive director of 
the international cruise passengers association 
the result is an overcapacity of berths in certain cruising 
areas keeping prices modest and competitive for passengers says 
ward author of the berlitz complete handbook to cruising 
since 85 percent of those who take cruises are eager to go again 
he adds the overcapacity is expected to decline as the margin grows 
robert thornton professor of marketing at miami university of 
ohio agrees with ward that overcapacity means the cruise industry 
may not be in for smooth sailing 
while cruises are in the midst of an unprecedented boom in 
popularity thornton foresees a change in marketing strategy if that 
growth which averaged 105 percent annually from 198087 is to 
continue 
plans by the cruise industry to expand by 30000 berths in the 
next five years he says could result in a classic overcapacity 
squeeze in profits 
because the market is already so heavily discounted the miami 
university professor recommends that consumers find a travel agent 
who specializes in cruises 
bargains exist and more may be in the offing for those who can 
wait for a lastminute trip he says for no cruise line will leave 
with an empty cabin if possible 
thornton says industries approaching overcapacity typically 
attempt to segment the market and he believes that tactic will be 
used more and more by the cruise industry as capacity exceeds demand 
that means youll have dinks double income no kids on 
cruise a singles on cruise b and retirees on cruise c he says 
ward puts it another way he notes a trend toward specialty 
cruising using smaller ships equipped to cater to young active 
passengers pursuing their hobbies or special interests 
in advising vacationers how to make a selection ward says there 
is a trend by some cruise lines to offer more ports in a week 
than their competitors according to ward 
but such intensive island hopping gives little time to 
explore a destination to the full before you have to nip back on 
board for a quick ride to the next port he says adding 
while you see a lot in a week by the end of the cruise you may 
need another week to unwind and youll be hard put to remember what 
you saw on which day 
ultimately this is not the best way to cruise except for 
those who want to see as much as possible in a short space of time 
ward who has been on more than 600 cruises himself agrees with 
the old maxim that the best way to unwind quickly is to travel 
slowly

irelands aran islands have so many 
stone walls that only seeing is believing 
the three inhabited islands inishmore inishmaan and inisheer 
add up to about 18 square miles but there must be hundreds of miles 
of stone walls they are usually dry walls of mostly sharp stones 
enclosing tiny pastures and gardens 
the walls are the key to the makeup of the aran islands lying 
across the mouth of the bay of galway on irelands west coast they 
are islands of limestone solidified sediment of a tropical sea that 
covered the area more than 270 million years ago 
documentary filmmaker robert flaherty in man of aran filmed 
on inishmaan in the 1930s showed viewers what seemed the epitome 
of isolation and struggle against the odds of nature 
the islands also inspired playwright john millington synge 
author of riders to the sea and the playboy of the western 
world when he visited in the 19th century he made the trip from 
galway by curragh the native open irish canoe made of timber lathes 
and canvas and rowed by two or more people 
although the islands are only about six miles from doolin in 
county clare and some 30 miles from galway they must have seemed 
remote indeed 
but today kilronan the main village on the biggest island 
inishmore can seem quite crowded by people looking for the remote 
boats bring day trippers from rossaveal north of galway and 
doolin both boat trips are far shorter than the three hours it 
takes the boat from galway 
the bedandbreakfasts in the aran islands have television hot 
water electricity and radiators in the bedrooms 
but the aran islands are still a world of their own and still 
remote in their way for visitors who spend days rather than hours 
on them walking and looking around and listening to the gaelic 
language 
a horse cart van or bike will take a visitor to the foot of the 
hill where stands dun aengus one of the best preserved prehistoric 
fortlike structures in europe the climb to the top has to be done 
on foot across a wet rockstrewn meadow with dainty little flowers 
and over rocks worn so smooth by nature and so crisscrossed by 
little crevices that they resemble giant tiles they are slippery in 
wet weather and chances are it will be misting if not raining 
there or anywhere else on the aran islands 
in addition to the stone walls stone ruins and stone houses 
stone crosses dot the landscape in memory of islanders killed at 
sea 
fishing is still a major occupation of the islanders and the sea 
still rules their lives the man running the tourist office may 
suddenly shoo away the tourists close down and dash to the beach 
where others clad in orange rescue suits are already launching a 
motorized rescue raft for a boat in trouble under the cliffs of 
moher across the water in county clare 
as dusk falls on inishmeer on a broad sand beach small boys 
play with their dogs the friendly donkeys no longer used for 
tilling the soil come up to nuzzle a passerby there are piles of 
curraghs on the beach for inishmeer is the only place in the 
islands where theyre still made 
beyond the beach on a sweep of dune are an old burying ground 
and various ruins dating back to medieval times or even earlier up 
a steep hill one comes upon a cashel wall ancient circular wall 
that used to enclose ecclesiastical buidings and within it a more 
modern tower house built perhaps in the late 14th century 
alone in the misty twilight visitors can still feel the 
remoteness of time and place

americans made 12 billion person trips in 1987 
according to the us travel data center 
a person trip is travel by one person a distance of 100 miles or 
more from home 
whether they traveled for business or pleasure many depended on 
a travel agent for help 
who are these travel agents 
sharon walker in her 20s works for the ohio motorists 
association travel agency in oberlin ohio its one of 27 
association branches throughout the state 
miss walker headed for the travel business straight out of high 
school lured by her love of travel an interest in geography and 
the prospect of free or cutrate trips a school in florida that 
offered a sixweek crash course plus six months of home study sent 
her on her way 
kaye jones a vice president of barnett travel tours and cruises 
in greensboro nc has been in the business more than 25 years 
she went into the travel field after trying and discarding nursing 
and banking 
jean chipman coowner of the encore preston ii travel agency in 
dallas was divorced and in her 30s when she went to work about 25 
years ago for a friend who owned a travel agency 
it was a traditional business for women without specialized 
training to enter when they wanted something to do after the 
children were grown much like real estate mrs chipman explained 
in a telephone interview 
but computerization has changed all that she said and most 
travel agencies dont have much time for inhouse training these 
days to get a job one needs computer knowhow she also notes that 
more and more men are entering the field especially at management 
level 
both mrs jones and mrs chipman are certified travel counselors 
ctc meaning they have taken courses offered by the institute of 
certified travel agents icta a nonprofit organization 
headquartered in wellesley mass devoted to educating travel 
industry personnel to earn the initials an agent must have 
completed a fivepart travel management program served at least 
five years in the travel industry and signed a code of ethics 
the icta also has started a new program of training in 
geographical areas that will allow agents who complete the course to 
use the desination ds or destination specialist 
a louis harris survey for the american society of travel agents 
asta showed that the gross dollar volume of all bookings handled 
by us travel firms in 1987 was 642 billion 
and yet it seems there is relatively little formal regulation 
in the field 
a spokesman for astas state legislative affairs department says 
only seven states regulate agents and agencies with the regulations 
varying statetostate the seven are california hawaii ohio 
rhode island washington illinois and florida 
various organizations within the industry itself including asta 
have codes of ethics for members astas covers such things as 
accuracy of any information an agent gives out full information to 
travelers about terms and conditions of any sale and prompt 
remittance of any undisputed funds 
the airlines reporting corp is owned by major us airlines and 
serves as a clearing house for receipts that agents get from airline 
tickets they sell it also sets standards for the agents with which 
it has agreements more than 33600 of them if an agency does not 
live up to its agreement arc can pull the plates through which 
it makes out airline tickets 
the icta quotes estimates that there are about 200000 travel 
agents across the country waiting to help travelers usually their 
services are free and they say that especially in this day of 
airline deregulation agents can save the traveler time and money 
with their computers contacts and background 
but how many travelers actually follow the advice to see your 
travel agent 
relatively few according to the travel data center it estimates 
that 13 percent of us travelers consulted an agent in 1987 and of 
those only 10 percent used them to book hotel or airline 
reservations 
asta however estimates that almost 90 percent of cruises are 
booked through travel agencies and 80 percent of airline travel 
but it estimates bookings of hotels through agents only in the 
mid20 percent range with most of that for hotels outside the

a good one 
the institute of certified travel agents a nonprofit 
organization headquartered in wellesley mass and devoted to 
educating travel industry personnel offers some advice 
first ask a friend whos had a good experience with an agent 
it also suggests that one look for the ctc certified travel 
counselor or ds destination specialist designations given by 
icta to those who have completed its courses 
also icta says membership of an agency in such trade 
associations as asta american society of travel agents and arta 
association of retail travel agents is an indicator of a 
seriousminded agent 
note too how long the agency has been in the field and how 
long its staff has been in the business beware of rapid turnover 
and note whether the office is neat wellstocked with brochures 
and well organized and whether the staff is helpful and friendly

americans are combining travel with volunteer service says the 
council on international educational exchange ciee 
volunteer workcamps have been popular in europe since the

relatively unknown concept for americans thats growing rapidly 
the ciee sponsors an international workcamps program in 14 
countries typically the summer workcamps involve 15 to 20 
volunteers living in communal fashion working and sightseeing 
together

the minimum age 18 there are limited opportunities for 16yearolds 
volunteers are responsible for transportation costs to the 
workcamp and a 100 program fee they are provided with free room 
and board

business travel has become a big ticket item for many 
corporations and many of them are learning to manage their own or 
to cut deals to cut rising travel costs 
us corporations are expected to spend over 115 billion on 
travel and entertainment in 1990 up from an estimated 95 billion 
last year according to an american express survey a similar survey 
by runzheimer international puts the median percompany travel 
expenditure for 1987 at 2348000 a rise of about 120000 over 
the previous two years travel and entertainment costs are the third 
largest controllable expense for most companies after salaries and 
data processing american express says 
one way companies are dealing with travel expenses is to do it 
themselves by adding inhouse travel specialists to their staffs 
about 29 percent of the 1600 companies surveyed by american express 
say they added travel managers in l988 an increase of 16 percent in 
two years 
many companies have computerized reservation equipment on their 
premises coupled with frequent reviews and closer enforcement of 
travel policies their travel costs continue to rise but at a rate 
less than overall average travel costs according to runzheimer a 
travel and living cost consulting company 
employers are finally realizing how much theyre spending on 
travel and theyre zeroing in on ways to control this major 
expense says bradford burris runzheimer publisher 
still nine out of 10 companies use travel agencies the american 
express survey shows heavy spending companies are able to get lower 
fares and better services by consolidating the number of agencies 
they use about half use a single agency but even when they use 
outside agencies more companies have become more directly involved 
in travel and entertainment expense management

here in one place you can contemplate 
18thcentury agricultural life 19thcentury industry and 
20thcentury music 
waterloo village is a restored rural village with buildings 
spanning two centuries offering the visitor a visible historic time 
chart

how the homesteaders who settled here along the banks of the 
musconetcong river milled grain by water power and worked their 
trades as weavers tavern keepers blacksmiths apothecaries and the 
like

revolutionary war andover forge in the village was producing gun 
barrels for the continental army in 1815 brig gen john smith an 
early landowner renamed the community to celebrate wellingtons 
victory over napoleon at waterloo that year 
the opening of the 102mile morris canal in the 1830s marked the 
next era with waterloo serving as an inland port for barges 
transporting coal iron and grain from pennsylvania to the hudson 
river the barges have gone now but the towpaths remain for walking 
through forests along lakes and rivers tall victorian mansion 
houses also remain as a legacy of waterloos mid19th century 
prosperity

1840s and nearly disappeared after the market crash in 1929 but the 
abandoned village was discovered by percival leach and louis 
gualandi in the 1940s and they began its restoration the two men 
partners in a design firm solicited money for restoration and 
antiques for the 11000acre property turning it into a historical 
museum now owned jointly by the state and the nonprofit waterloo

inflation has been heating up in europe for the 
first time in years and that plus the higher interest rates being 
used to combat it are causing a lot of worry across the continent 
but few economists believe europe will return to doubledigit 
inflation or that it will threaten the european economies comeback 
of the late 1980s 
the pickup in prices which coincides with a resurgence in us 
inflation is being blamed on fasterthanexpected economic growth 
which caught european governments by surprise central banks across 
europe it turned out slackened their grip too much after the 
october 1987 stock market crash economists said 
both consumer buying and investment spending have been strong in 
europe and as a result factories have been working at or near 
capacity 
economists also blame the upward trend in the dollar and the 
weakness of european currencies particularly the west german mark 
last year as well as higher commodity prices especially for oil 
higher prices are being exacerbated by higher wage claims 
threatening to cause wageprice spirals in some countries 
since the second half of 1988 european countries have tried to 
stop inflation by raising interest rates to discourage that spending 
and borrowing but there is no clear indication it is working 
signs are that consumers are continuing to spend in britain for 
example retail sales spurted 25 percent in february 
this renewed inflation is a big disappointment for europe 
following the great successes the oncelumbering and mature 
economies have had in turning themselves around by making their 
industries more modern and efficient 
there are inflationary pressures within most of the economies 
in europe i think the inflation fear is fairly widespread said 
nigel rendell an economist at the london investment firm james 
capel and co 
european inflation will peak at 5 percent this year its highest 
level since 1985 up from with 35 percent last year he predicted 
it should fall back to 4 percent next year as us economic growth 
slows and the dollar weakens he said 
britain and italy are expected to fare the worst with an average 
annual rate of up to 7 percent in 1989 economists say 
the continental economies are not as overheated as those of the 
united states and britain said anthony thomas an economist with 
the london investment firm kleinwort grieveson ltd as a result 
inflation is a much easier problem for them to contend with he 
said 
indeed rendell said its important to stress that although 
were going to get back to inflation were not going to get back to 
the teenage doubledigit inflation we saw in the 1970s or the 
doubledigit inflation we saw earlier in the 1980s 
many economists think interest rates will have to go even higher 
particularly after the us government reported friday that 
wholesale prices surged 1 percent in february prompting the stock 
markets to plunge the rates might go up within the month they said 
but david bowers an economist at barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
said he is not convinced higher interest rates will work in spain 
for example because spanish consumers arent heavily indebted and 
because a large amount of investment is foreign and funded from the 
outside 
in addition these high rates besides squeezing mortgage holders 
and other borrowers are boosting currencies and that is worsening 
trade imbalances in britain and italy 
however economists are not concerned that the higher interest 
rates will lead to a recession 
in europe there is a lot of economic momentum rendell 
said we see economic growth at relatively high levels it will 
be less than last year but it still will be pretty strong 
rendell expects economic growth of 3 percent in europe this year 
compared with 4 percent in 1988 
here are annual inflation rates for 1988 and forecasts for 1989 
and 1990 for the major european countries they were provided by 
james capel and co 
west germany 12 percent 29 percent 2 percent 
france 27 percent 32 percent 2 percent 
britain 49 percent 71 percent 45 percent 
italy 5 percent 65 percent 6 percent 
spain 49 percent 6 percent 55 percent

a multimillion dollar agreement to import 
angolas diamonds announced this month by new yorkbased lazare 
kaplan international could translate into more than just muchneeded 
hard currency to the warravaged southern african nation 
under terms negotiated with endiama the angolan state diamond 
company lazare kaplan will import 20 million a year in 
highquality uncut gem diamonds for processing at its plant in 
caguas puerto rico company spokeswoman amy wiener said in a 
telephone interview from new york 
wiener said the first shipment has arrived for cutting and 
polishing in the plant 
the agreement is the first major international business deal 
announced with the marxistoriented government since the signature 
dec 22 of usbrokered accords by angola cuba and south africa on 
the phased withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola 
the withdrawal is being made in return for the independence of 
the south africancontrolled territory of namibia formerly known as 
southwest africa 
i was impressed by the fact that all those with whom we met in 
luanda took a businesslike nonideological approach lki 
chairman maurice tempelsman said in a company news release 
in view of the close diplomatic cooperation between the 
american and angolan authorities in connection with the withdrawal 
of south african and cuban forces from angola and namibia there is 
no reason why this agreement should not be followed by many mutually 
beneficial examples of economic cooperation between our two 
countries 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with angola which 
gained independence from portugal in 1975 after a 14year colonial 
war and has since been fighting usand south africanbacked rebels 
ms wiener said the diamond importing agreement the first lki 
has made with angola was indirectly related to the december accords 
the peace process was moving forward and continues to move 
forward she said it can only help business and were 
encouraged by it 
south africa agreed to stop supporting jonas savimbi and his 
national union for the total independence of angola but the united 
states continues to supply about 15 million a year in military aid 
through bases in neighboring zaire 
before his inauguration president bush wrote savimbi assuring 
him of continued us support in order to pressure angolan president 
jose eduardo dos santos into negotiating 
nearly 90 percent of angolas hard currency earnings come from 
oil pumped mainly by an angolanamerican consortium in fields near 
the mouth of the zaire river 
under portuguese rule angola was exporting between 5 percent and 
8 percent of the worlds diamond production exports fell following 
independence but rose in 198182 to 13 million carats worth 165 
million 
in 1987 the portuguese company spe portuguese entrepreneurial 
society signed a cooperation agreement with endiama and 50 
portuguese technicians are working in angola as diamond mining 
advisers 
a delegation from endiama visited lisbon earlier this month 
following a trip to the united states and there have been newspaper 
reports here of a possible joint venture between portugal and angola 
in mining and finishing 
throughout the 1980s portugal has been an illicit export route 
for unfinished angolan diamonds the lisbon daily europeu said the 
illicit trade amounted to 200 million in 1983 alone 
in 1984 savimbiled rebels attacked diamond mines in 
northeastern angola and production fell off sharply 
the area was later divided into production blocs and leased to 
mining companies in the same way angola has awarded concessions to 
oil companies the angolan army now provides security in the 
diamondmining areas 
ms wiener said lki does not plan to become involved in actual 
diamond mining in angola

companies ranging from breweries to 
playboy enterprises to atampt now view the the worlds most famous 
beach through greentinted glasses 
instead of seeing a halfmillion tanned and sunburned college 
students in town to party until they drop they see dollar signs 
students spend big bucks on their annual excursion to the sand 
surf and bars of daytona beach a fact increasingly recognized by 
both big and small entrepreneurs 
during the fiveweek period betwen march 4 and april 1 this year 
an estimated 100 million will be spent by spring breakers here for 
everything from hotels to food to beer according to evelyn fine 
director of the midflorida research and business center in daytona 
beach 
since fort lauderdale cracked down on the merry making in that 
sun capital a few years ago daytona beach has become a haven for 
college students nationwide 
were the biggest spring break destination in the world ms 
fine said fort lauderdale bitterly regrets losing the spring 
break market 
if the college students are here can businesses which cater to 
that age group be far behind 
playboy magazine which featured the women of spring break in 
its april issue is one company with an active beach presence 
playboy is here because were no 1 in the college market its 
a great party said cindy rakowitz a communications director for 
playboy enterprises the majority of our readers are in the 18 to 
34yearold range and thats the market thats here 
on the pool deck of penrods clarendon plaza hotel a long line 
of young men waited for bikiniclad lynne austin miss july 1986 
and ava fabian miss august 1986 to autograph pictures 
i am in love screamed a somewhat inebriated young man 
holding his autographed photos 
the two signed such things as my no 1 sweetheart and love 
and kisses on the black and white publicity photographs 
playboy also gave the young men a plastic bag containing a 
variety of cologne samples sunscreen and condoms all products 
advertised in the mens magazine 
also in the bag was playboys spring break magazine 
i read about daytona beach in playboy said senior kurt 
brewer a chemical engineering major from wichita kan who added 
that in past years that he had spent spring break on padre island in 
texas 
while playboy was using sex to push its products atampt was trying 
to appeal to students minds 
for students trying to get away from the studying rat race a 
10000squarefoot openair sevenfoothigh plastic and maze was 
constructed on the beach 
known as the atampt maze challenges students were encouraged to 
use their wits and legs to try to make it through the maze in record 
time 
each day the mazes pathways which contain atampt advertising 
posters are reconstructed into a different configuration giving 
students a chance to try several different mazes 
we estimate on the average it will take people between 15 and 
20 minutes to complete the maze said david pugliese atampt college 
market manager who said those that complete the maze in record time 
receive tshirts beach towels and duffel bags 
lots of people are vying for the attention of the college 
students and i feel this is a healthy and positive event as 
compared to some of the things spring break is known for 
explained gail piccirilli in charge of the college marketing for 
atampt basking ridge nj as she led a reporter through the maze 
she added though she hadnt come to daytona beach as a student 
my father wouldnt let me she said 
other companies catering to the student crowd included brewers 
anheuser busch miller and coors and automakers chrysler and general

share prices plunged today in tokyo for their 
sharpest oneday decline this year and the dollar gained against 
the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average a 7701point loser friday 
shed another 36621 points or 114 percent to finish trading at 
3165480 
the indexs decline marked the largest oneday drop this year in 
a trading session dominated by sell orders following a sharp fall at 
the start of todays session 
volume traded on the first section today was estimated at 950 
million shares compared with fridays 118 billion shares 
share prices were lower across the board said manji ueda of 
nomura securities japans largest brokerage 
he attributed the indexs plunge to a 50point decline in the dow 
jones industrial average in new york on friday and the trend toward 
a weaker yen 
in new york the dow jones index fell sharply following a us 
government report friday that the nations producer price index of 
finished goods rose a full percentage point in february triggering 
concern that inflation will grow and interest rates will rise 
instability on the foreign exchange market and higher interest 
rates tend to discourage market participants from investing in 
stock while higher us interest rates would make the dollar more 
attractive to foreign currency investors 
the majority of japanese investors collected profits by selling 
off risky issues after they were discouraged by the decline on the 
new york market and the yens weakness ueda said 
a national holiday tuesday also prompted them to sell off 
he said 
financial markets will be closed in tokyo on tuesday a national 
holiday marking the spring equinox 
in currency dealings the dollar gained ground and finished 
trading at 13192 yen up 085 yen from fridays 13107yen close 
the us currency opened at 13188 yen and fluctuated in a range 
between 13179 yen and 13208 yen 
the 1 percent rise in the us producer price index of finished 
goods in february triggered a new wave of worries about inflation 
and interest rate hikes said a trader with bank of tokyo speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the dollar fluctuated in a fairly tight range in tokyo mainly 
because of position adjustments the trader said speculative 
investors sold the dollar for profittaking around the 132yen 
level while they bought it near 13170 yen he said 
the tokyo markets dollarbuying interest is still strong and 
investors are now concerned about the us consumer price index in 
february due out tuesday the trader said 
he said a higher consumer price index would further encourage 
investors to buy the dollar and boost its value against the yen

a federal jury reported an 111 deadlock but 
decided to continue deliberating as the possibility of a second 
mistrial emerged in the watershed gaf corp stock manipulation case 
on the ninth day of deliberations sunday the jury in the first 
criminal trial linked to the confessions of ivan boesky reheard more 
of two hours of testimony but gave no indication it was closer to 
breaking the impasse 
us district judge mary johnson lowe told the panel of nine 
women and three men to reconsider the evidence after the panel 
reported the split saturday the sole juror said he or she could 
shift positions under no circumstances 
the jury was sequestered march 10 after a sixweek retrial 
attorneys for both sides declined to comment sunday on the 
protracted deliberations 
the case in federal court in manhattan is considered a key test 
of the governments ability to try wall street corruption emanating 
from the insider trading scandals of the mid1980s it is the first 
securities fraud case to reach the trial stage 
gaf and its vice chairman james t sherwin have denied charges 
of trying to boost the price of union carbide corp stock in october 
1986 in an attempt to reap gains from the planned sale of a large 
block of shares they are charged with eight counts including stock 
manipulation conspiracy wire fraud and securities fraud 
the jury in a note read in court saturday asked the judge for 
help in resolving the deadlock but did not say whether the majority 
favored acquittal or conviction the move came after more than 65 
hours of deliberations 
your honor we need help there are 11 jurors who have come to 
a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who 
does not agree the jury said 
lowe said that before declaring a mistrial because of the 
deadlock she wanted the jurors to reassess their positions but she 
said jurors should not vote against their conscience just because 
they were outnumbered 
lowe called a mistrial jan 10 after ruling the prosecution 
unintentionally withheld from the defense a piece of evidence that 
showed a key document had been altered 
an acquittal would be a major setback for the manhattan us 
attorneys office which chose gaf as its leadoff case in a series 
of securities fraud trials set for this year 
prosecutors based the gaf case on information supplied by boyd l 
jefferies a los angeles broker who was fingered by boesky in late 
1986 and testify under an agreement with the government he already 
has agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts for breaking 
securities laws 
boesky a former arbitrager is serving a threeyear term for 
insider trading charges under a settlement in which he also paid 
100 million in fines and restitution 
jefferies testimony is considered central to the boeskyderived 
trials of speculator salim b lewis and takeover specialist paul 
bilzerian later this year attorneys for those two defendants have 
been attending the gaf trial 
during deliberations the jury asked to rehear testimony of 
jefferies and several other witnesses as well as review charts 
tables and other documents presented during the sixweek trial 
gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building materials 
manufacturer and two subsidiaries face a maximum total fine of 12 
million sherwin 55 of princeton nj faces 40 years in prison 
and a fine of up to 2 million

a delaware judge this morning granted an injunction 
sought by shamrock holdings inc to keep polaroid from completing 
its share repurchase program one of the key elements in the instant 
camera companys fight against a shamrock takeover 
shamrock had said earlier today that if the injunction was not 
granted it would tender its 49 million polaroid shares 
vice chancellor carolyn berger of the delaware chancery court 
granted the injunction for one week while shamrock appeals her 
rulings of last week to the delaware supreme court she said the 
week would give the higher court time to decide if it would accept 
the appeal 
berger ruled friday that polaroid can go ahead with its plan to 
buy back 22 percent of its shares and reaffirmed the companys 
controversial employee stock ownership plan the buyback offer was 
set to expire at midnight tonight 
shamrock claims the stock buyback plan would stack the deck in 
favor of polaroid management in a proxy fight 
polaroid has been resisting shamrocks hostile takeover bid since 
july when the burbank calif company made an unsolicited offer of 
40 a share in january shamrock increased the bid to 45 
last july polaroid put 97 million shares into an employee stock 
ownership plan in january the company announced a recapitalization 
plan that included selling 300 million of stock to corporate 
partners lp a private investment group 
shamrock a radio and television concern owned by the roy e 
disney family owns about 48 million shares of polaroid and is 
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the 
may 9 annual meeting

traders went back to work in the stock and bond 
markets today worried about the economic outlook and wondering is 
history going to repeat itself 
a repeat of history would mean a precipitous drop in prices 
another crash like black monday oct 19 1987 
the financial markets have been nervous for months about 
inflation and the prospect that the federal reserve board would 
continue to drive interest rates higher to curb prices and cool off 
the economy 
but concerns about how the economy could affect stock and bond 
prices became fullfledged anxiety on friday after the labor 
department reported inflation at the wholesale level soared 1 
percent for the second month in a row in february 
the news unleashed a storm of selling in the stock and credit 
markets the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more 
than 48 points and the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell 
more than 17 for each 1000 in face amount that meant higher 
interest rates 
bond traders were so upset by the inflation report they totally 
disregarded the strength of the dollar friday in many sessions in 
the past the credit markets shrugged off negative economic signals 
because the dollar moved higher 
traders didnt care about the dollar all they saw was interest 
rate hikes in the offing 
fridays market trends continued today as stocks slumped and 
interest rates and the dollar rose 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 1250 
points at 227964 as of 11 am est the treasurys long bond was 
off another 150 per 1000 face value as its yield which moves 
in the opposite direction rose to an even 93 percent the dollar 
was slightly up against the japanese yen west german mark and 
british pound 
to some observers fridays performance bore a disquieting 
resemblance to oct 16 1987 also a friday that day the dow jones 
industrial average lost 108 points in a precursor to its 508point 
collapse three days later on black monday 
could it happen again 
a crashtype situation is conceivable said robert brusca 
chief economist with nikko securities international noting that 
overseas things dont look any better 
japan has a currency thats falling and an economy thats 
runing at a high rate of speed he said 
the japanese face high inflation because they are heavily 
dependent on oil imports and the price of oil keeps climbing 
brusca said 
european nations face similar problems he said 
but raymond stone manager of global and fixed income and 
economic research for merrill lynch capital markets discounted the 
possibility of a repeat of october 1987 
there is one difference stone said before the crash the 
dollar was heading south the dollar has been firming the last 
several days 
you dont have the same lack of confidence you had at that 
time said stone you had a bad inflation number but theres 
no fear of a collaspe of the currency 
i wouldnt go too far in making a comparison he said 
economic fundamentals aside there is little chance of such a 
steep decline in stock prices as on oct 19 1987 because safeguards 
have been implemented as a result of the crash on friday some of 
those safeguards were deployed 
price limits on stockindex futures trading on the chicago 
mercantile exchange known as circuitbreakers were used for the 
first time since being imposed last year by major financial markets 
many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategies 
involving simultaneous trading of stocks and the stockindex futures 
for worsening the crash leading to the development of the 
circuitbreakers which also provide for a temporary halt in stock 
market trading if the dow jones average falls 250 points in one day 
even with safeguards in place stone doubted there would be much 
movement in the markets monday because of the impending release of 
another inflation indicator the consumer price index for february 
on tuesday 
i think theres going to be a lot of reluctance to make a major 
commitment until cpi he said 
the consensus among economists was for a 05 percent increase in 
consumer prices 
if the consensus expectation is realized it could take some 
of the steam out of the ugly number we got on friday stone said 
william v sullivan director of money market research for dean 
witter reynolds inc said it would take more than just a few good 
economic reports to turn the markets around 
there is almost a sense of despair in the marketplace regarding 
the outlook for interest rates he said 
sullivan said he expected the fed would tighten credit further 
its highly improbable for any chance of a drop in interest rates 
in the next few months 
the fed increased its discount rate the interest it charges its 
member banks half a percentage point to 7 percent almost four 
weeks ago 
but brusca of nikko securities said the fed is faced with a 
really terrible dilemma if the fed were to tighten any quicker 
what would it do to the dollar which is already stronger than it 
should be 
when us interest rates go up the dollar becomes more 
attractive to foreign investors and also rises but when the dollar 
is too high the us trade deficit increases so a surge in 
interest rates could widen the trade gap 
the trade deficit was cited as one of the factors contributing to 
the 1987 crash

the supreme court today cleared the way for the 
partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers 
the court over two dissenting votes set aside an earlier 
postponement that had been granted by justice william j brennan 
a federal appeals court panel here voted 21 last jan 27 to 
uphold thenattorney general edwin meeses decision to allow the 
newspapers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal 
newspaper preservation act 
the 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially 
failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws 
under the joint operating agreement the detroit free press and 
the detroit news would combine their business advertising and 
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial 
staffs 
by a 54 vote last month the full appeals court refused to 
reconsider the threejudge panels january ruling 
brennan in a threeparagraph order march 4 postponing the 
merger said he was referring the matter to the full court 
a group of michigan readers and advertisers who sued to stop the 
partial merger contend that the free press a morning newspaper 
owned by knightridder inc is not a failing newspaper even though 
it lost 10 milion a year between 1981 and 1986 
the opponents calling themselves michigan citizens for an 
independent press say the free press and news which lost 50 
million in the same period were unprofitable solely because both 
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out 
of business 
gannett co which owns the news is the nations largest 
newspaper publishing group knightridder is the second largest 
knightridder has threatened to close down the free press if the 
joint operating agreement is not approved 
the opponents emergency request said the agreement threatens 
the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities where like 
detroit competing newspapers still exist 
justices harry a blackmun and john paul stevens voted to extend 
the postponment until the court considers a formal appeal by those 
who oppose the partial merger 
finally we seem to be near the point where we can assure the 
readers of the free press that their newspaper is saved said free 
press publisher david lawrence 
in other action today the court 
agreed to decide whether there is a constitutional right to 
take the hullocinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice 
the court agreed to review a ruling that oregon officials 
violated religious freedom by denying unemployment compensation to 
two men fired for using peyote at religious ceremonies 
agreed to use a new jersey case to decide whether federal 
courts may make it easier to broaden age discrimination lawsuits 
against employers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by hoffmannla roche inc 
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off some 
1200 employees at new jersey plants 
turned away an appeal by 10 people criminally convicted for 
their participation in a 1985 protest demonstration at a 
philadelphia abortion clinic 
let stand rulings that 1985 articles in hustler magazine 
villifying two women active in fighting pornography are 
constiutionally protected expressions of opinion 
the two women lost their attempts to revive libel lawsuits 
against hustler magazine and its publisher larry flynt 
left intact rulings that the requirement of a floridabased 
company that all its employees attend weekly christian devotional 
services violated the rights of an atheist who worked there 
the townley manufacturing co based in chandler fla lost its 
appeal in which its lawyers argued that the owners 
constitutionally protected religious freedoms were violated 
agreed to decide a narrow but potentially significant point 
of environmental law one that may affect the effectiveness of 
private citizen enforcement 
the justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuit 
against a tillamook county ore landfill by the couple who own an 
adjacent dairy farm 
turned away a stillpending bigmoney antitrust dispute over 
the sale of raw milk 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that could cost millions for two cooperative associations of 
dairy farmers and a marketing agent for dairy cooperatives 
the detroit newspaper case is michigan citizens for an 
independent press vs thornburgh a695

after their desert landing at edwards early saturday the five 
astronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families 
they were going back to work today briefing the space agency on 
the shuttles performance and the experiments conducted during the 
nearly flawless fiveday mission said steve nesbitt a johnson 
space center spokesman 
a preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection 
tiles will need to be replaced in contrast to the last shuttle 
flight in december when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged 
this is one of the best yet said cindy lodge who works on 
the shuttles tile system weve had no major damages theres a 
few dings around the nose cap nothing severe at all 
the tiles shield orbiters during the fiery reentry into earths 
atmosphere 
five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure 
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped ms lodge 
said only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced she 
said 
the brakes which have caused problems during previous shuttle 
landings also performed well engineers said 
the brakes looked the best ever no signs of any heat there 
was no damage whatsoever said nasas tip talone who coordinates 
processing of the orbiter for each flight 
the mission ended with a pictureperfect landing that was watched 
by a nearrecord crowd of 460000 
five hundred people cheered the astronauts return to houston 
later in the afternoon 
weve had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight 
said mission specialist james f buchli who had been on two 
previous discovery missions 
the flight was commanded by michael l coats who had flown one 
previous shuttle mission the other crew members pilot john e 
blaha and mission specialists robert c springer and james p bagian 
made their first voyages 
discoverys flight the 28th shuttle mission was the third since 
challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on jan 28 1986 seven 
astronauts died in the explosion which brought shuttle flights to a 
halt for nearly three years 
discovery blasted off from cape canaveral fla a week ago 
today six hours into the mission the crew accomplished its primary 
mission the deployment of a 100 million communications satellite 
the satellite completes a network that will enable the national 
aeronautics and space administration to have nearly constant contact 
with space shuttles and other satellites 
the astronauts also photographed the earth their film will be 
edited into a movie that will document environmental damage by man 
and nature 
four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments were killed 
shortly after touchdown so researchers can study how their 
intentionally cut legs healed in microgravity many of the 32 
fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch to 
see how space affected embryo development 
other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of a 
project to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow in 
microgravity the results will be studied by the researchers who 
designed the experiments 
the only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressure 
reading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to the 
orbiter the astronauts conserved electricity for a day until ground 
controllers corrected the difficulty 
the next shuttle to fly atlantis is expected to be rolled out 
to a cape canaveral launch pad wednesday for its scheduled april 28 
liftoff the atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will map 
the surface of venus

continental airlines flight attendants announced a strike today 
and began picketing at airports but no immediate effects on flights 
were reported at strikebound easterns sister carrier 
i can only confirm that the strike has been called myra 
clayton spokeswoman for the union of flight attendants said today 
in houston she said the decision was made among union leaders 
sunday night but it was not directly related to the strike that has 
all but shut down eastern airlines since march 4 
meanwhile donald trump said today he is no longer willing to pay 
his prior offer 365 million for easterns profitable east coast 
shuttle because of the labor troubles at continentals sister 
airline and eastern began efforts to hire new pilots to replace the 
ones who have walked out 
as the continental strike deadline came at 10 am est some 
flight attendants set up picket lines at the carriers main houston 
hub but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally 
there are about 6800 continental flight attendants the company 
and union give differing figures on how many are union members in 
the largely ununionized carrier 
its like an annual event continental spokesman dave messing 
said an easter 1988 call for a sickout failed to materialize and 
theres no reason to believe this attempt will be any more 
successful he said 
about 10 members of the union of flight attendants dressed in 
maroon uniforms with continental emblems walked a picket line at 
houston intercontinental airport carrying yellow signs proclaiming 
on strike 
we were prepared to strike in december and we were promised at 
the time that if we waited the company would be willing to sit down 
and negotiate a contract with us in january but that still has not 
happened sheila hammond one of the pickets said 
there were also pickets reported at newark nj international 
airport and denvers stapleton international airport two other 
major continental airports 
it was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked 
off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off 
there were no immediate reports of problems at airports affected 
by the picketing or at other airports many airports require 
wouldbe pickets to seek permission in advance 
we dont see any evidence of that at this point said richard 
boulware public affairs director for denvers stapleton 
international airport we have not received any requests for 
permission to demonstrate or picket by the flight attendants 
continental said in a statement that the flights were running 
normally which shows that our flight attendants are proud of 
their service and will continue to support the companys goal of 
providing for the customer 
the company says that only about 5 percent of its flight 
attendants are actually duespaying members of the attendants union 
which is the only union at the airline since 1983 the union says 
that more than 60 percent of the attendants are members 
continentals flight attendants voted in december to authorize a 
strike over wages and have been free to walk out since that time 
union president carla winkler said sunday 
messing said the company had reserve attendants it could call in 
if the walkout became significant he said continental operates 
about 1400 flights daily serving 120 cities in the united states 
and numerous foreign countries 
continentals flight attendants although represented by a union 
have been operating without a collective bargaining agreement since 
september 1983 when frank lorenzo chairman of texas air corp 
continental into bankruptcy and abrogated his union contracts texas 
air is the parent company of both eastern and continental 
winkler said she hoped a continental walkout would make it clear 
to travelers and government officials that the problem with 
lorenzo isnt just at eastern 
eastern meanwhile announced this weekend a campaign to hire 
pilots to replace those who have refused to cross the picket lines 
the union for the 3600 pilots who have honored the machinists 
strike since it began march 4 said it will go to us bankruptcy 
court in new york to fight the plan the airline filed for protectio 
under the bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began 
all transactions outside the normal course of business need 
the judges approval said air line pilots association attorney 
james linsey hiring a new work force is certainly not in the 
normal course of business 
only about 200 eastern pilots most of them management are 
flying and eastern is operating less than 10 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights most of the 
stilloperating flights are on the shuttle service between boston 
washington and new york which eastern has been trying to sell to 
trump 
in a letter to lorenzo disclosed today trump said he wouldnt 
pay 365 million for the shuttle because it has become an entirely 
different business in that its market share and customer base may be 
lost for some time to come if not forever 
today the business is worth considerably less than the price 
negotiated last fall the multimillionaire real estate developer 
said 
eastern has said that increasing the number of pilots is the key 
to its survival 
we need pilots to start rebuilding eastern spokesman robin 
matell said sunday weve waited patiently for the pilots union 
to come to its senses 
a union spokesman jb stokes said he doubted eastern would 
find many applicants because of an industrywide pilot shortage 
they want to test the marketplace and they also want to try to 
frighten our pilots into thinking theyre being replaced they 
should have learned by now that intimidation isnt going to work 
stokes said

realestate magnate donald trump said today he 
wants to chop more than a third off the 365 million price hes 
willing to pay for the eastern airlines shuttle because of the 
strike that has grounded the carrier 
in a letter to frank lorenzo head of easterns parent company 
texas air corp trump said the shuttle has become an entirely 
different business in that its market share and customer base may be 
lost for some time to come if not forever 
today the business is worth considerably less than the price 
negotiated last fall trump said 
he did not specify how much hes willing to pay now but told the 
associated press in a telephone interview im looking for a 
reduction in excess of 125 million 
the new york billionaire developing announced last october that 
he would purchase the moneymaking operation for 365 million in cash 
and name it after himself 
however the strike by easterns mechanics and the unwillingness 
of most of the airlines pilots to cross picket lines has forced 
eastern to file for bankruptcy court protection 
only about 200 of the 3600 eastern pilots have crossed the lines 
since the strike by the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers began march 4 
eastern has been operating only slightly more than 100 daily 
fights about onetenth its normal level 
the airline which has begun advertising for new pilots has 
acknowledged there are no nearterm prospects for expanding its 
operations 
shuttle flights are among those still taking off the airline has 
been struggling to keep the shuttle between boston new york and 
washington in the air by offering a number of passenger incentives 
including promotional fares as low as 12 
trump said he remained interested in buying the shuttle and would 
like to close a deal before the shuttle operations become worse 
in his letter he asked lorenzo to call him later today to 
discuss the sale

the supreme court on monday cleared the way for 
the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers under a 1970 
law that permits an antitrust exemption for financially failing 
newspapers 
the court over two dissenting votes set aside an earlier 
postponement granted by justice william j brennan 
in other decisions the high court again refused to let states 
and state agencies be sued for allegedly violating federal copyright 
laws and rejected an appeal by workers at a california nuclear 
power plant who are challenging their employers random drug tests 
in the detroit newspapers case a federal appeals court panel in 
washington voted 21 on jan 27 to uphold thenattorney general

photographer who accused a state university in virginia of 
unauthorized use of his photographs

a ruling that threw out at least temporarily a lawsuit attacking 
the tests 
the justices already are studying the validity of drug tests in 
three other cases one involving a private employer and two 
concerning federal workers or federal regulations 
the case acted on monday stems from tests initiated by southern 
california edison co at its san onofre nuclear plant

dispute over the sale of raw milk the justices without comment 
let stand a federal appeals court ruling that could cost millions

wheat futures prices closed sharply lower monday 
on the chicago board of trade amid reports of a blizzard in kansas 
but other grain and soybean futures advanced with soybeans posting 
fairly strong gains 
the wheat market had opened lower and remained depressed 
throughout the morning on perceptions that weekend precipitation in 
the great plains had improved growing conditions for the maturing 
winter wheat crop and added badly needed moisture to the soil 
wheat doubled its losses in the afternoon as selling increased 
following reports that winddriven snow had closed several highways 
including interstate 70 in western kansas an area especially in 
need of moisture 
the market went through some liquidation despite the fact that 
when we look at all the precipitation recording during the past 24 
hours it wont necessarily be characterized as a droughtbreaker 
said ted mao a grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
soybean futures contined their recent upward trend on continuing 
concerns about tight supplies of soybeans for immediate delivery 
at the close wheat was 5 cents to 8 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 427 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents higher with march at 279 a bushel oats were cent lower 
to 1 cent higher with march at 209 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents 
to 8 cents higher with march at 777 a bushel

the former head of a defunct wall street 
brokerage firm was charged monday with illegally inflating the 
prices of three stocks in a twoyear scheme undone by the 1987 stock 
market crash 
in a 15count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury 
eugene laff former chairman of haas securities corp was charged 
in what authorities called the first securities fraud case emanating 
from the oct 19 1987 crash 
the indictment is the latest in a threeyear federal crackdown on 
wall street crime and the first by the manhattan us attorneys 
office since the government formed nationwide securities and 
commodities task forces in january 
laff 51 of greenwich conn was charged with conspiring to 
manipulate the prices of three overthecounter stocks to increase 
the value of substantial holdings owned by laff and haas securities 
the indictment is based on the confessions of stanley a aslanian 
jr 29 a former haas trader and presidentwho pleaded guilty in 
january to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the government 
he has not been sentenced 
i think its a reflection of an ongoing problem of penny stock 
fraud acting us attorney benito romano said its one that 
deserves our serious consideration generally 
attorneys for laff denied the charges suggesting that 
coconspirators including aslanian wrongly accused laff of 
participating in the alleged fraud 
it seems that in looking at the indictment a lot of conduct of 
other individuals appears to be attributed to mr laff based on the 
theories of conspiracy said john lang an attorney for laff 
the indictment alleges that laff took part in a conspiracy 
starting in january 1986 to manipulate the stock prices of flores de 
new mexico inc ts industries inc and big o tires inc 
he is charged with conspiracy securities fraud mail fraud and 
obstructing a securities and exchange commission investigation each 
of the 15 counts carries a maximum five years in jail and 250000 
fine 
haas securities through laff allegedly cornered the market on 
shares of the stocks and set artificially high prices by sustaining 
the high price laff allegedly was able to reap a large profit the 
indictment does not specify how much money was involved in the 
schemes 
haas securities a 75yearold firm that had 12000 customers 
before going out of business nine days after the crash is now 
liquidating its assets in us bankruptcy court proceedings 
the indictment says laff acted as a market maker on the 
stocks by being ready to buy and sell a specific stock at prices 
published by the firm 
laff aslanian and several unnamed coconspirators the 
indictment says allegedly raised the prices of the manipulated 
stocks and placed large blocks of shares in friendly accounts that 
were concealed from the public to create the appearance of demand 
the indictment names but does not charge henry lorin president 
of a private investment company that allegedly controlled the 
accounts and bought blocks of the three stocks 
laff made bogus nonmarket unauthorized transactions that 
artificially boosted the share prices without money ever changing 
hands the indictment claims laff then sold some stocks accumulated 
by haas securities at the inflated prices 
the charge also says laff published false information about the 
stocks made unauthorized sales to customers who did not have the 
money to pay and refused to accept sell orders from customers 
haas securities went bellyup after the crash because it no 
longer had the capital to stay in business authorities said the 
alleged scheme to manipulate the stocks couldnt be maintained after 
the market drop and the share prices collapsed 
after the crash investors demanded information about the stocks 
haas securities allegedly was able to sustain the prices for several 
days after the crash until it filed for bankruptcy and the 
manipulated share prices plunged

the number of working oil and gas rigs declined by 
three this week to total 740 baker hughes inc reported 
despite occasional weekly increases the count has followed its 
historical pattern of decline during the first months of the year 
falling from a latedecember high of 940 
a year ago the total was 943 the company said monday 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker copmany that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states louisiana showed the greatest 
decrease nine while pennsylvania was down five and michigan was 
off four other declines were in north dakota two and colorado and

coleman co inc said monday it had accepted 
a 545 million buyout offer from takeover strategist ronald o 
perelman who apparently outbid the companys founding family 
macandrews amp forbes holdings inc which is controlled by 
perelman agreed to pay 74 a share in cash for the company which 
is the maker of the famed coleman lantern other outdoor recreation 
equipment and home heating and air conditioning equipment 
the coleman family which controls about 27 percent of colemans 
71 million common shares outstanding had offered 64 a share feb 
14 to take the company private in a debtfinanced takeover 
sheldon c coleman the companys chairman and chief executive 
is the grandson of company founder wc coleman 
the family reportedly raised its offer to 68 per share during a 
sealedbid auction required by a special committee of the coleman 
board that was reviewing the bids 
coleman stock rose 425 a share at 7275 in heavy new york 
stock exchange trading 
a number of analysts had speculated the familys initial overture 
may have been an attempt to open the company to competing higher 
offers 
but the family indicated its buyout proposal was aimed at 
enabling it and senior management to focus on colemans longterm 
interests family members also repeatedly said privately they wanted 
to retain control of the corporation 
neither company would comment beyond a brief statement announcing 
the deal the statement did not indicate whether other bids were 
received 
the merger agreement was approved unanimously by the special 
committee and by colemans board of directors 
under the agreement macandrews amp forbes would begin a 74 a 
share tender offer by friday for all outstanding coleman shares the 
offer was conditioned on at least twothirds of the shares being 
tendered 
the deal also gives macandrews amp forbes the option to acquire up 
to 185 percent of colemans outstanding common shares for 74 a 
share if those shares are needed to help satisfy the minimum tender 
provision the companies said 
coleman had record sales of 6579 million and record earnings of 
245 million in 1988 
in addition to lanterns coleman is one of the worlds biggest 
makers of outdoor recreation equipment such as coolers sleeping 
bags and popup travel trailers the company also makes air 
conditioning equipment lawn movers home and recreational vehicle 
heaters air guns and electrical generators 
macandrews amp forbes interests range from cosmetics and jewelry to 
comic books and licorice extract 
it is controlled by perelman who became chairman of revlon group 
inc after leading a successful takeover fight for the cosmetics 
company and made a lucrative although unsuccessful run at gillette 
co the personal products maker 
late last year a perelmanled group put up 315 million and got 
51 billion of government aid to acquire five bankrupt texas thrift 
institutions with assets of more than 12 billion 
the coleman family had indicated it might sell off the companys 
heating and air conditioning products division to help pay for its 
proposed leveraged buyout 
analysts said perelman also might want to sell part of the 
companys operations but they doubted there would be a wholesale 
breakup of coleman 
so far they havent chopped up companies theyve acquired 
said harold vogel a merrill lynch analyst who follows coleman

crude oil prices plummeted in heavy trading on 
the new york mercantile exchange monday reversing last weeks rally 
in which prices rose nearly 2 a barrel 
the april contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude dropped 82 cents to a closing price of 1951 a 
barrel taking back 45 percent of the previous weeks gains 
on friday the april contract closed at 2033 the highest level 
since aug 14 1987 when crude prices were 2057 a barrel it 
capped a weeklong rally during which prices rose 183 a barrel 
from the previous friday 
refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined but 
not as sharply 
unleaded gasoline for april delivery declined 14 cent to 5548 
cents a gallon while april heating oil lost 21 cent to settle at 
5336 cents a gallon 
traders said the crude market was technically driven fueled in 
part by normal dealings on the last day of the april contract other 
contract months for 1989 had only modest declines 
but market fundamentals had not warranted the high price levels 
reached on friday they said 
the market realized that and took profits today said james 
steel an energy broker at refco inc 
the market had expected problems with april deliveries to 
underpin the recent price rise but they never materialized some 
analysts said 
instead the market got a bucket of cold water in the form of 
the april squeeze not developing said nauman barakat vice 
president of energy investments at prudentialbache securities inc 
steel said once prices broke through the 20 mark on the 
downside the momentum picked up that prompted a sharp 
selloff he said 
strong demand and declining world oil production have helped 
boost prices recently but energy specialists had forecast that the 
market could not sustain prices much higher 
demand is not that strong given that and given expected 
slowdowns in economic growth it doesnt justify oil being over 20 a 
barrel steel said 
brokers said the slower decline in product prices helped an even 
sharper fall in crude prices

opponents of the partial merger of detroits 
two major daily newspapers will ask the supreme court to hear their 
appeal despite the courts refusal monday to further delay the 
business deal 
the court with only two justices dissenting lifted without 
comment a postponement granted march 4 by justice william j brennan 
the order cleared the way for the detroit news owned by gannett 
co and detroit free press owned by knightridder inc to merge 
their business and production operations under an antitrust 
exemption allowed by the 1970 newspaper preservation act 
the justice departments approval of the partial merger was 
challenged by a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers 
michigan citizens for an independent press and public citizen a 
washingtonbased advocacy group 
we lost a battle in the war said william schultz attorney 
for public citizen on the other hand i feel much better because 
there were two dissents than if there would have been no dissents at 
all the fact that we got two dissents puts us in the serious 
category 
with the lifting of the stay the newspapers can begin 
immediately to put their partial merger into effect 
but a knightridder vice president frank hawkins jr said it 
was too early to discuss timing of the merger obviously there 
have to be some discussions with our friends at gannett hawkins 
said 
opponents intention to continue their appeal to the supreme 
court means the newspapers had to decide whether to proceed with the 
merger at the risk of the court later ordering it dismantled 
once the merger is implemented the egg has been scrambled and 
how do you unscramble the egg said harold spaeth a political 
scientist at michigan state university in east lansing mich who 
specializes in the supreme court 
if the merger was consummated and then terminated it would be 
almost like starting up a new newspaper and you just dont do that 
in a metropolitan area on a daily basis at this point in time he 
said 
schultz said he was confident there were sufficient votes on the 
court to grant a petition to hear the cases the courts order did 
not specify how many of the seven nondissenting justices in fact 
supported lifting the stay 
spaeth however said the courts refusal to delay the merger 
made it unlikely they would consent to hear the case 
justices harry a blackmun and john paul stevens voted to extend 
the postponement until the court considers a formal appeal by those 
who oppose the partial merger 
i cant think of a nicer way to start out the week free 
press publisher david lawrence said finally we seem to be near 
the point where we can assure the readers of the free press that 
their newspaper is saved 
neither gannett nor the news commented on the justices decision 
opponents of the joint operating agreement argued that the free 
press was not a failing newspaper even though it lost 10 million a 
year between 1981 and 1986 the news lost 50 million in the same 
period 
the losses were due solely to pricecutting by the newspapers in 
an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business the 
opponents said 
the opponents emergency request to the supreme court said the 
agreement threatens the independence of daily newspapers in 25 
cities where like detroit competing newspapers still exist 
knightridder has threatened to close the free press if the joint 
operating agreement is denied

american telephone amp telegraph co plans no 
immediate cost cuts in response to a federal communications 
commission deregulation move last week atampt chairman robert e 
allen said monday 
abolishing the regulations by which atampt sets longdistance rates 
in favor of linking rate increases to inflation doesnt completely 
deregulate longdistance service allen said 
the ruling last thursday is a step toward full deregulation of 
atampt but it is just a step he told a news conference before a 
meeting of the economic club of detroit 
the deregulation is intended partly to give atampt incentives to 
increase efficiency since its profits will no longer be limited to 
a fixed rate of return on investment but allen said were not 
planning any costcutting moves as a result of the decision 
also at the news conference allen questioned the prospects for 
what he said is needed federal deficitfighting action and he 
voiced his own irritation with automated taperecorded sales 
pitches to peoples home telephones 
allen questioned whether congress and president bushs 
administration after squabbling over stagesetting matters such as 
john towers unsuccessful nomination as defense secretary can get 
along well enough to battle the federal budget deficit 
definite action also is needed to reverse nearly 10 years of 
ignoring the national debt allen said 
a lot of people are saying the right things at this point i am 
a little skeptical about that i am not sure that recent events in 
washington will create the kind of harmony between the leadership 
and the administration to make that happen 
but he said theres always hope with a new administration 
regarding computeroperated taperecorded sales messages some 
companies automatically play over peoples telephones allen said he 
did not favor regulatory action 
i dont like it allen said i am personally offended by a 
computer trying to talk to me 
allen said it was up to customers to discourage such sales 
tactics through their reaction against products marketed that way 
innovators will always find ways to market their products he 
said but the marketplace works if most people find them 
offensive they wont be rewarded for their efforts and they will 
try something else

developer donald trump lowered his offer for 
eastern airlines shuttle by at least 125 million monday because of 
damage to the service by a walkout by eastern machinists and pilots 
i bought something that had a 57 percent share of the market 
the billionaire said in a telephone interview that share has 
deteriorated considerably 
in response miamibased eastern sent trump a letter monday 
afternoon informing him the carrier is seeking other bids for the 
shuttle the letter says eastern has recently received other 
offers unsolicited and invites trump to resubmit a bid 
trump announced last october that he planned to acquire the 
lucrative threecity shuttle service from easterns parent texas air 
corp for 365 million 
but on monday trump said he wants to cut the offered price by 
more than a third 
im looking for a reduction in excess of 125 million he 
said adding that he considered 200 million a reasonable offer 
kevin murphy an airline analyst for the investment firm morgan 
stanley amp co said trumps move could reopen the bidding for the 
shuttle while signaling the developers reluctance to get into the 
airline business 
art kent a spokesman for houstonbased texas air did not return 
repeated calls for comment excerpts from easterns letter to trump 
signed by barry p simon senior vice president for legal affairs at 
eastern were released in a statement 
we believe it is our obligation to all our constituencies 
creditors shareholders employees and the communities and traveling 
public we service to ensure that any shuttle sale is completed on 
the best possible terms for eastern simon wrote to trump 
your intention to not proceed at this time on the terms in the 
oct 12 agreement requires that we take action consistent with our 
obligations under the reorganization process to solicit offers from 
third parties for the shuttle 
on march 4 easterns 8500member machinists union chiefly 
mechanics and baggage handlers walked off the job the refusal of 
most of the airlines pilots to cross the machinists picket lines 
has forced eastern to file for protection from creditors under the 
bankruptcy laws 
easterns hourly shuttle service usually a profitable operation 
linking new york with boston and washington has been flying during 
the strike 
in the first days of the walkout most eastern shuttle flights 
flew nearly empty but the airline has been trying to rebuild its 
business with a number of passenger incentives including 
promotional fares as low as 12 fares returned to normal on 
saturday 
eastern made another pitch monday to lure shuttle passengers 
starting march 23 when the cutrate weekday fares of 49 return to 
99 eastern will offer an ontime guarantee on shuttle flights 
if the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from 
the gate eastern will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on 
the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights the exceptions 
would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather 
a rival shuttle service operated by new yorkbased pan am corp 
has been flying with full passenger loads 
pan am has seen business on its shuttle service double since the 
strike began said pan am spokeswoman elizabeth manners the airline 
has added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the 
increased demand she said 
in a letter sent monday to texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
trump said last fall i agreed to buy a fully operational shuttle 
which held nearly 60 percent of the market commanded the principal 
loyalty and confidence of business travelers and provided excellent 
service to the customer 
however as you and i discussed the shuttle has become an 
entirely different business in that its market share and customer 
base may be lost for some time to come if not forever 
the shuttle is worth considerably less than the price 
negotiated last fall trump said 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock in miami said the airline has been 
encouraged by shuttle traffic and it was showing signs of luring 
back its regular business travelers he referred requests for 
comment about the trump letter to texas air 
lorenzos new york office also referred calls to the houston 
headquarters 
bruce nobles president of the trump shuttle the company formed 
in anticipation of purchasing the eastern shuttle estimated eastern 
was now carrying about 20 percent of the shuttle market 
systemwide eastern is operating only about 100 flights a day 
about onetenth of its normal flight schedule the airline has begun 
advertising for new pilots while acknowledging there are no 
nearterm prospects for expanding its operations 
trump who promised to rename the hourly service the trump 
shuttle and redecorate the bluesilver boeing 727s said monday he 
was still interested in buying the operation and was prepared to 
close a deal with lorenzo within a week 
im not surprised hed want to lower his price considering the 
strike and the troubles easterns had said robert decker an 
analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago

pennwalt corp dealt a severe blow to an 
investor groups hostile takeover bid monday by agreeing to a 1 
billion white knight buyout by the french governmentcontrolled 
societe nationale elf aquitaine 
some analysts said they did not expect any rival bids to top the 
french oil and chemical companys 132 a share offer for each of 
pennwalts approximately 8 million common shares outstanding 
centaur a new york investment group that was offering 110 a 
share for pennwalt issued a statement extending its offer through 5 
pm est friday the offer which had been set to expire at 5 pm 
monday was extended to give the group time to review the agreement 
with elf aquitaine the statement read 
the group controls about 127 percent of pennwalts common shares 
pennwalt jumped 1312 to 13012 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
elf aquitaine said it would begin a tender offer for the pennwalt 
shares on or before friday with a scheduled expiration 20 business 
days later 
the merger which would maintain pennwalts name and keep its 
headquarters in philadelphia is subject to shareholder approval 
the boards of both companies have approved the agreement 
we are delighted that pennwalt is becoming a member of a global 
organization in which there is such a strong strategic fit between 
our businesses pennwalt chairman and chief executive edwin e 
tuttle said in a statement 
unlike centaurs offers which pennwalt repeatedly spurned 
tuttle called the elf aquitaine buyout in the best interests of 
all pennwalt stakeholders 
michel schneider maunoury chairman and chief executive officer 
of elf aquitaine inc the corporations us holding company based 
in stamford conn said in a telephone interview the deal had been 
under discussion for three to four weeks and he did not expect any 
trouble completing it 
maunoury said the merger would enhance elf aquitaines efforts to 
develop its specialty chemical business and to increase its presence 
outside europe 
its a good company he said it has good sales all 
around the world everything 
elf aquitaine in which the french government owns a controlling 
interest has more than 20 billion in annual sales with more than a 
third related to chemicals 
analysts said the deal likely would succeed 
it gives the shareholders top dollar said donald pattison a 
chemical analyst for cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc in new 
york i dont see any way anybody could get any more out of it 
its really a credit to management because they stuck to their guns 
and they really got a bluechip purchaser 
centaur headed by financiers abbey j butler and melvyn j 
estrin announced last june it had acquired a 65 percent interest 
in pennwalt which then was trading at about 62 a share 
pennwalt responded by selling its drug and equipment businesses 
and buying back about 40 percent of its outstanding shares 
centaur made its initial 100 a share offer on dec 13 but 
pennwalt had resisted centaurs overtures since indicated it would 
seek other alternatives such as further restructuring or a sale of 
the company to a third party 
pennwalt which had 102 billion in sales in 1988 repeatedly 
has refused to meet with centaur saying the offer was inadequate 
and the partners unworthy 
centaur received a setback earlier this month when a federal 
judge blocked a special shareholders meeting the partnership had 
hoped to use to stage a proxy fight for control of pennwalts board 
of directors 
on feb 23 pennwalt announced it planned to sell its wallace amp 
tiernan equipment division based in belleville nj for more than 
40 million to a managementled group as part of its defensive 
strategy 
in a separate announcement monday pennwalt said it had agreed to 
sell an italian subsidiary pennwalt italia spa to akzo chemicals 
bv of the netherlands terms were not disclosed

southland corp owner of 7eleven convenience 
stores monday reported it lost 37 millionin the fourth quarter and 
2162 million for all of last year reflecting high interest costs 
and other expenses related to its 1987 leveraged buyout 
the losses occurred despite strong operating results for its 
7eleven stores 
revenue amounted to 197 billion in the three months ended dec 
31 and 799 billion in all of 1988 
because of the buyout the seven months ended july 31 1987 were 
reported on a separate accounting basis than subsequent periods 
which means results from the two periods within 1987 cannot be added 
together to produce 1987 fullyear financial results and no 
fullyear comparisons can be made between 1987 and 1988 
southlands 1988 earnings before interest taxes depreciation 
and amortization was 4943 million including 165 million from 
divested operations the company said 
jere w thompson southlands president and chief executive

financial achievements during its first full year after undergoing 
one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history thompson said in 
a prepared statement 
southland added 600 convenience stores to its 7eleven

5300 stores operated by licensees and affiliates in the united 
states and 19 foreign countries 
southland operates about 7000 additional convenience stores in 
the united states and canada and owns a 50 percent interest in 
citgo petroleum corp

emhart corp said monday it had agreed to 
be acquired by black amp decker corp in a 28 billion takeover to 
thwart a hostile 24 billion buyout attempt by an investor group 
that includes oil heir gordon p getty 
the 40 a share agreement unanimously approved by the boards of 
directors of both companies came weeks after farmingtonbased 
emhart spurned the unsolicited 35 a share offer from the getty 
group known as topper lp 
peter l scott emharts president chairman and chief executive 
officer said the combination with black amp decker a leading tool 
and appliance maker would create business synergies that should 
benefit emhart shareholders 
the agreement with black amp decker also alleviates my concern 
that prolonging the takeover battle with topper could have adverse 
effects on certain segments of emharts business he said 
topper issued a statement saying it was stunned and outraged 
over the agreement and that it was not asked to make a higher offer 
the group indicated its offer remained negotiable and said it was 
studhing numerous options 
emhart stock fell 37 cents a share to 4075 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading black amp decker fell 262 a share to 
close at 2075 
both emhart and black amp decker have been heavily involved in 
takeover activity during recent years 
emhart staged an unsuccessful hostile bid to acquire stanadyne 
inc a maker of plumbing fixtures automotive and metal products 
in early 1988 stanadyne escaped by undergoing an 820 million 
leveraged buyout led by the investment firm forstmann little amp co 
scott has overseen a restructuring at emhart that has resulted in 
the sale of some 18 businesses and the purchase of several key 
product lines since september 1986 such as price pfister plumbing 
fixtures and gardenamerica inground watering systems 
emhart and black amp decker indicated they planned to sell emharts 
electronics and information systems division under an overall debt 
reduction program 
black amp decker acquired the small appliance business of general 
electric co several years ago the company also waged a lengthy 
unsuccessful battle last year to acquire american standard inc a 
new yorkbased plumbing and air conditioning equipment maker and 
has been seeking other acquisitions since 
nolan archibald black amp deckers president and chief executive 
officer said emhart would broaden his companys product base and 
provide excellent growth opportunities for black amp decker for 
years to come 
the doityourself products of emharts consumer sector fit 
ideally with our powertool business broadening our lines with 
noncompeting products moving through identical channels of 
distribution he said 
the companies said they were considering cutbacks in emharts 
30000member workforce but had made no decisions they also said 
black amp decker had agreed to honor all emhart employee severance 
plans 
black amp decker with annual sales of about 23 billion is the 
worlds leading producer of power tools and household products the 
company posted a profit of 33 million on revenue of 7055 million 
for its first quarter ended dec 25 
emhart is a diversified producer of industrial and commercial 
products and information and electronic systems emhart had 1988 
revenue of 276 billion and net income of 1266 million 
mitchell quain an analyst with wertheim schroder in new york 
city said black amp decker could suffer from the debt it must incur 
to finance the buyout if high interest rates slow housing 
development and thus suppress demand for its products 
but quain also said that naming scott as a director and chairman 
of black amp decker would give the company a better shareholder focus 
black amp decker will begin a 40 a share tender offer for all 
outstanding shares of emhart common stock the buyout was 
conditioned on at least twothirds of emharts common shares being 
tendered 
in rejecting the topper bid earlier this month emhart said the 
offer was too low and appeared to be tainted by insider trading 
scott cited unusual trading activity before announcement of the 
offer by topper whose partners also include new york real estate 
developers lawrence and zachary taylor 
emharts stock which was selling at 3275 when topper tendered 
its offer had risen almost 10 in the month prior to the offer amid 
takeover rumors

owners of the seabrook nuclear power plant 
bought a bond monday to guarantee enough money to decommission the 
reactor if necessary after tests a move that could give them their 
longsought lowpower license 
the nuclear regulatory commission in an unprecedented move 
ordered seabrook owners in december to show they could come up with 
72 million to tear down and clean up the plant after the lowpower 
tests with radioactive fuel if the plant fails to overcome 
evacuationplanning and financial obstacles to a commercial license 
opponents have argued that towns in the area could not be safely 
evacuated in case of a reactor accident one of the 12 new england 
utilities that own the plant has sought bankruptcy protection becuse 
of debt associated with the plant 
the owners paid 85 million monday to aetna casualty and surety 
co of hartford conn to insure any part of the 72 million that 
the owners could not come up with themselves said seabrook 
spokesman rob williams he said aetna would refund as much as 6 
million if the plant operates commercially 
edward brown president of seabrook operator new hampshire 
yankee called the bond purchase a significant milestone for 
seabrook station 
we have now met all of the nuclear regulatory commissions 
stringent requirements to receive a lowpower license and begin 
important testing of seabrooks reactor brown said in a statement 
the nrc left it to its staff to approve the bond and issue the 
lowpower license though the commission gave opponents 10 days 
after the license is issued to seek a stay 
if the nrc staff takes a week or two to review this and then 
theres a 10day waiting period it looks like we could be in a 
position to receive lowpower in the first part of april williams 
said 
veteran plant foe robert backus lawyer for the seacoast 
antipollution league noted that the surety bond if approved is 
the last obstacle to lowpower tests at the 59 billion seabrook 
project which originally was planned for commercial operation 10 
years ago 
so its not a good day as far as im concerned backus said 
in another seabrookrelated development monday gov judd greggs 
office announced that the state will start intensive negotiations 
with lead plant owner public service co of new hampshire and its 
creditors on a bankruptcy reorganization plan for the utility 
public service sought bankruptcy protection 14 months ago because 
of debt from its 36 percent seabrook share 
gregg in a departure from unwavering state support for seabrook 
announced earlier this month he will try to block testing of the 
plant until commercial operation is assured he called it bad 
business judgment to contaminate the plant before a commercial 
license is guaranteed 
state officials said they plan to request within the next week in 
bankruptcy court that the testing be stopped 
on tuesday an nrc licensing board opens what could be the last 
round of hearings on the plants commercial license 
the atomic safety and licensing board will hold hearings for 
several months in boston on evacuation plans that seabrook developed 
for nearby massachusetts communities that refuse to cooperate 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis maintains that no evacuation 
plans could work for the crowded beaches and communities within 
seabrooks 10mile emergencyplanning zone

the parent corporation of strikecrippled eastern airlines got 
double trouble monday when new york developer donald trump cut his 
bid for easterns shuttle and flight attendants called a strike at 
sister carrier continental airlines 
there were few signs of disruption from the strike by the flight 
attendants union at continental but mary jane barry president of 
the eastern flight attendants union local predicted the walkout 
would grow 
right now theyre still trying to get the word out ms 
barry said in miami 
continentals flight attendants voted in december to authorize a 
strike over wages and have been free to walk out since then union 
leader carla winkler said 
ms barry said parent texas air corp has been trying to offset 
easterns strike begun march 4 by its machinists union and joined 
by the pilots and flight attendants by increasing continentals 
service 
only about 200 eastern pilots about half of them management are 
flying and eastern is operating less than 10 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights 
continentals executive vice president and chief operating 
officer lewis jordan said that as of midday monday only 35 
attendants were participating in that walkout and would be 
permanently replaced 
ms barry speaking at her union hall where walls were decorated 
with posters showing a dracula figure representing texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo said unions will announce new actions aimed 
at continental on tuesday she declined to give details 
in another development monday the air line pilots association 
charged that eastern pilots operating during the strike are omitting 
preflight aircraft inspections an external visual check which must 
be done before departure 
thats an absolute lie perpetrated by the pilots association 
as another tactic to scare the public said eastern spokesman 
robin matell theres been no violation of any regulations and 
alpa knows that but they dont care 
meanwhile trump said that because of the strike he no longer 
thought easterns northeast shuttle service was worth the 365 
million he offered last year he said hed like to cut the price by 
more than 125 million 
the deal has been awaiting final approval and eastern last week 
said it would ask us bankruptcy court in new york where eastern 
filed march 9 for chapter 11 protection and bankruptcy 
reorganization to expedite the sale to trump 
in a letter to lorenzo trump said the shuttle has become an 
entirely different business in that its market share and customer 
base may be lost for some time to come if not forever 
eastern replied with an afternoon letter telling trump it was 
seeking other bids for the shuttle the letter which the airline 
issued in a public statement said eastern has recently received 
other offers unsolicited and invited trump to resubmit a bid 
eastern officials said passenger traffic on the 62 daily flights 
on the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle has improved steadily 
since the first days of the strike when some flights carried as few 
as seven passengers for one week it slashed weekday fares from 99 
to 49 one way and weekend fares from 69 to 12 to lure passengers 
back 
eastern made another pitch monday to lure shuttle passengers 
starting march 23 when the cutrate weekday fares of 49 returns to 
99 eastern will offer an ontime guarantee on shuttle flights 
if the shuttle plane is more than five minutes pulling away from 
the gate eastern will greet the arriving passengers with refunds on 
the spot or free tickets for other shuttle flights the exceptions 
would be delays caused by airport problems or severe weather 
a rival shuttle service operated by new yorkbased pan am corp 
has been flying with full passenger loads 
pan am has seen business on its shuttle service double since the 
strike began said spokeswoman elizabeth manners the airline has 
added flights and introduced larger aircraft to accommodate the 
increased demand she said 
a teamsters leader at pan am meanwhile said his union has 
initiated guerrilla warfare against pan am operations 
especially its northeast shuttle service 
william f genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
and head of the pan am local said the action was taken to show his 
unions support for the eastern strike and to protest pan ams 
imposition of 35 million in pay cuts on its teamsters last year 
the guerrilla tactics include deliberate diversion of baggage 
and cargo and cancellation of passengers reservations he said 
when the continental strike deadline came at 10 am est some 
flight attendants set up picket lines at the carriers main houston 
hub but flights appeared to be departing and arriving normally 
pickets also were reported at newark nj los angeles and denver 
there are about 6800 continental flight attendants but the 
union has been without a contract since continentals 1983 chapter 
11 reorganization the company says only 5 percent of its attendants 
belong to the union and the union says 60 percent continentals 
pilots and machinists lost their unions in 1983 
continental spokesman dave messing said the flight attendants 
walkout is like an annual event an easter 1988 call for a 
sickout failed to materialize and theres no reason to believe 
this attempt will be any more successful he said 
messing said continental operates about 1400 flights daily 
serving 120 cities in the united states and abroad 
the union says continental flight attendants are paid 11000 to 
15000 annually 30 to 50 percent lower than their counterparts at 
other airlines 
but jordan the airline vice president said continental is 
paying comparable industry rates he added that the airline on 
jan 1 implemented a 19 million wage and fringe benefit increase 
it was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked 
off their jobs and how many were picketing on their days off 
in another development related to the eastern strike a federal 
judge in manhattan denied a request by unionized workers at four new 
york area commuter railroads to delay his order barring them from 
honoring eastern picket lines 
us district judge robert p patterson jr who signed 
preliminary injunctions barring sympathy strikes at the four rail 
lines late friday refused to temporarily delay them while the 
unions appealed
