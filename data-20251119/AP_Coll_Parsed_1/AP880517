a month after the 60th academy awards evidence 
persists that the oscars golden touch doesnt always live up to 
its reputation 
columbia pictures had hoped that the sweep of nine oscars by 
the last emperor would result in a boxoffice bonanza but 
despite doubling the number of theaters to more than 800 after the 
awards the chinese epic has added only 10 million to theater 
grosses 
after 164 days in release the last emperor had sold 366 
million worth of tickets in the united states and canada by 
comparison the ghostly comedy beetlejuice grossed 467 
million in just 33 days 
still james r spitz president of columbias domestic 
distribution maintains the last emperor has had a very good 
performance since the awards 
comparing the last emperor to beetlejuice is like 
comparing apples to oranges he said the last emperor will 
never have the teenage audience that beetlejuice has 
spitz predicted the bernardo bertolucci film will continue doing 
good business through memorial day and will remain in distribution 
for a long time 
moonstruck which collected acting awards for cher and 
olympia dukakis has added 10 million since the oscars bringing 
its total to 69 million the figure is impressive since the film 
had been in wide release for more than two months 
much has been written about how winning oscars can inflate 
actors salaries with one exception this years winners seem 
unlikely to boost their paychecks 
since romancing the stone and fatal attraction michael 
douglas has become one of the most indemand stars in hollywood 
his win for wall street will have little effect on douglas who 
sometimes produces his own films the china syndrome jewel 
of the nile 
douglas next film is for sherry lansing and stanley jaffe who 
produced fatal attraction in black rain he will play an 
american police officer trying to solve a murder by the yakusa the 
japanese mafia 
having appeared in the witches of eastwick suspect and 
moonstruck in 1987 cher can afford a rest no new films have 
been announced for her in the wake of the oscar but the scripts 
must be piling up at her door meanwhile she will collect a 
fortune with her las vegas act 
sean connery winner as supporting actor in the 
untouchables needs no help from oscar or anyone else in his 
career he has been a top wage earner since his james bond days 
hell appear this summer in presidio with mark harmon and 
works next as harrison fords father in the third indiana jones 
movie 
olympia dukakis seems to be the major recipient of oscars 
beneficence although a distinguished stage actress she was little 
known before moonstruck since her nomination she has been 
able to decline two offers for television series she has accepted 
a small role in mike nichols working girls which stars 
melanie griffith harrison ford and sigourney weaver but her 
agents predict big things for her 
the april 11 oscar show drew generally poor notices but also the 
best television rating in years 
the ratings show that we didnt lose our audience even during 
a sweep by the last emperor said samuel goldwyn jr who 
produced the show for the academy i tried to prevent that by 
putting a heavy load of comedy robin williams eddie murphy 
toward the end the audience stayed with us 
goldwyn recognized the problems in moving to the shrine 
auditorium with its poor acoustics and the horendous traffic jam 
but those problems can be solved i think we benefited from 
having 6000 in the theater it was a much warmer audience the 
music center where the awards show previously was staged held 
only 2000 people 
most critics lambasted the 3hour broadcast time and goldwyn 
commented that the academy will have to address that problem 
there are certain things in the show that the academy is 
interested in but the public isnt he said 
efforts to eliminate such awards as short subjects 
documentaries and animation from the show have so far failed to 
achieve board of governors approval 
will goldwyn be around next year to help deal with such problems 
not on your life he said two years is enough

twenty years ago the berrigan brothers 
and seven other roman catholic pacifists marched into a draft board 
office here grabbed files from the drawers then took them out and 
burned them with homemade napalm 
the may 17 1968 protest by the catonsville 9 inspired 
similar protests elsewhere and marked the entry of radical 
catholics into the antiwar movement 
two decades later most members of the catonsville 9 have joined 
other antiwar protesters in societys mainstream although they 
continue to espouse the ideals that prompted them to go to prison 
but three of the eight surviving members are still defying the us 
government in the cause of nuclear disarmament 
this town of 48000 west of baltimore housed the draft board 
offices for baltimore county the suburban area that surrounds the 
city 
on the day of the protest the group led by priests daniel and 
philip berrigan walked into a secondfloor office yanked 600 
files from the drawers took them out to the parking lot and burned 
them they then joined hands and said the lords prayer as they 
waited to be arrested 
we were tired of hearing the government trying to discredit 
the peace movement as longhaired hippy fag kids it was not just 
a movement by people who were draft dodgers said defendant 
george mische now a 50yearold labor organizer in st cloud minn 
the symbolic burning coming just five weeks after martin luther 
king jr was shot and a month before robert f kennedy would meet 
an assassins bullet threw tinder on opposition to the vietnam 
conflict and sparked similiar draft record burnings in milwaukee 
washington chicago and elsewhere 
thousands of people many of them priests and nuns as well as 
antiwar activists such as tom hayden and abbie hoffman marched in 
the streets of baltimore during the weeklong trial in october 1968 
the nine defendants argued that the evil of the vietnam war 
required persons of conscience to fight it but they were convicted 
of destruction of federal property and spent anywhere from 9 
months to 3 years in prison 
defendant philip berrigan spent the longest time in prison now 
a former priest married and the father of three he said recently 
that he has no intention of retiring from his career as a peaceful 
violator of us laws 
we cant very well do that because of the state of the world 
he said were killing ourselves and some of us are not 
making a murmur about it 
berrigan 64 is incarcerated in a york county va jail for 
throwing blood on tomahawk nuclear weapons aboard the uss iowa in 
norfolk 
his brother the rev daniel berrigan 66 lives in a jesuit 
community in new york he is free on bond appealing a prison 
sentence for damaging missile warheads at a general electric co 
plant in king of prussia pa in 1980 philip berrigan is 
appealing the same conviction 
artist tom lewis 48 of worcester mass is the only other 
catonsville 9 member still actively practicing civil disobedience 
last month he was sentenced to 100 hours of community service 
for hammering on military weapons during a demonstration on the 
42nd anniversary of the bombing of hiroshima last august he said 
he has dedicated his life to living among the poor and to peace 
work 
the other surviving catonsville defendants are living quieter 
lives 
mary moylan 52 a nurse who went underground for nine years 
before surrendering in 1979 now reportedly works again as a nurse 
in the baltimore area 
thomas melville now 57 a former maryknoll priest and his 
wife marguarita a former nun said they joined the catonsville 
protest because they were concerned about us actions in 
guatemala where they had served before being expelled 
today mrs melville teaches at the university of 
californiaberkeley while her husband is writing a book both have 
given speeches and demonstrated against us intervention in 
central america he said 
defendant john hogan a former maryknoll brother was expelled 
from guatemala with the melvilles he now lives in new haven 
conn and works as a carpenter 
mische moved to st cloud in 1976 where he ran successfully for 
the city council the conservative minnesota town eventually became 
the first in the state to declare itself a nuclear free zone 
the ninth defendant david darst 26 a christian brother who

fire swept through a soviet passenger ship 
docked in this western japanese port early wednesday leaving nine 
people dead one missing and 35 injured the fire bureau said 
toshio yabuno of the osaka city fire bureau said eight bodies 
were recovered from a still smoldering section of a passenger 
cabin earlier a person was found dead of smoke inhalation 
he said the victims identities and nationalities were not known 
white smoke billowed from the 4870ton priamurye as fire squads 
pumped water into the lower decks firefighters wearing oxygen 
masks plunged through the smoke to search for the missing people 
as of 1200 am 11 pm tuesday edt nearly 10 hours after 
the fire broke out one person was still missing and believed 
trapped inside yabuno said 
thirtyfive people were injured in the predawn blaze most from 
smoke inhalation according to yabuno he said 28 of the injured 
were taken to hospitals in osaka and seven others were treated at 
the port area for minor burns or bruises 
the cause of the fire was not known said yoshiaki kataoka of 
the maritime safety agencys regional headquarters in okobe the 
agency was informed of the blaze about 150 am 1250 pm edt 
tuesday he said 
kataoka said many of the passengers were soviet students and 
workers visiting japan on a tour organized by the communist youth 
league 
the ship was carrying 295 passengers and 129 crew members when 
it arrived tuesday at osaka 255 miles west of tokyo kataoka said 
firefighters temporarily stopped battling the blaze at one point 
because water pumped into the lower decks had caused the ship to 
list the extra water was removed 
police cordoned off the area and ambulences sped to the dock 
the priamurye left vladivostok on may 7 and made stops at otaru 
on japans northern island of hokkaido and in tokyo on thursday 
it was to have left for hiroshima the official said 
soviet consular officials took most passengers to a junior high 
school gymnasium 
the worst ship disaster in recent years involving a soviet 
cruise vessel occurred on aug 31 1986 when the admiral nakhimov 
sank in the black sea after colliding with the freighter pyotr 
vasyev with the loss of 398 lives 
both captains were sentenced to 15year prison terms 
on feb 16 1986 the 20000ton soviet cruise liner mikhail 
lermonov slammed into rocks off new zealand and sank but although 
the liner was carrying more than 700 passengers and crew there was 
only one fatality a soviet crew member

is it le grand pooton or an actual fact 
item if diluted thinly enough the juice of one lemon would 
cover the entire state of oregon 
item the food spilled from tacos in a single afternoon would 
fill the shoes of everyone in norway 
as it turns out both items are actual facts cully abrell 
and john thompson have compiled in their new book moses may have 
been an apache and other actual facts a tongueincheek tome 
that just may be the next best thing to chopped liver this summer 
the main street press of pittstown nj has issued 50000 
copies of their new book moses may have been an apache and other 
actual facts the waldenbooks chain bought 15000 
each pair of handlettered facts in the book is accompanied 
by drawings reminiscent of robert ripleys believe it or not 
panels thompson produced the black ink artwork and wrote the text 
with abrell they call the book le grand pooton not to be 
confused with la petite crouton 
in england they would simply be called eccentrics said 
their publisher martin grife in america they might be called 
nut cases i think they are far saner than we are though they 
definitely are characters 
grife describes the book as humor for the intelligent reader 
you have to have some knowledge about the world to understand 
whats funny about actual facts he said and if you dont 
think theyre cleverly written try dropping or changing a word or 
two 
abrell and thompson arent very forthcoming when asked to 
explain the genesis of individual entries 
because of recent findings in a dig near tucson 
archaeologists now believe moses to have been an apache the book 
says 
they both wandered the desert didnt they abrell said 
if placed inside president taft president wilson would have 
stuck out a total of 18 inches the book says 
statistics taken to their ultimate extreme notes thompson 
the recurring themes in the book include musk oxen snakes 
presidents potatoes and grosvenor utah 
with a good actual fact theres a certain irritant value 
abrell said acknowledging people have divergent reactions some 
fall on the floor laughing and some sit as if youre speaking 
lithuanian 
abrell 60 lists 40 some occupations on his resume ranging 
from bartender to north woods guide to lifeguard he taught drama 
at wichitas friends university for 19 years before retiring in 
1982 when declining enrollment money and facility problems forced 
the elimination of his department 
thompson 36 is a former student of abrells who sometimes 
works as a freelance artist 
unlike mr abrell however mr thompson has never really 
gotten started at anything and now seems pretty much to have given 
up he has a degree in art his actual facts biography says 
the two live in an old farmhouse on a 16acre plot much of 
which was reclaimed from wheat fields a huge barn is being 
remodeled into new living quarters outbuildings bulge with the 
fruits of frequent garage sale trips about 60 chickens and five 
confident roosters roam the grounds 
the abrellthompson phone is listed under a fake american indian 
name 
during a recent interview abrell slipped frequently into an 
irish accent he attributed the lapses to his mixed ancestry 
rather than the rum apricot brandy and sangria he had been 
consuming to soothe a sore throat the reclusive thompson spent 
much of the interview looking at newspaper advertisements for lawn 
mowers 
abrell said a sampler of actual facts was shipped off to 
five publishers with a note is there a market for more of 
these 
we got back one rejection slip we got back another that said 
we only deal through agents we havent yet heard from the other 
two abrell said 
and martin wrote us a letter that said yes yes yes yes 
yes thompson said 
the two balk at the idea of a book promotion tour booksigning 
parties or telephone interviews on radio talk shows but abrell 
uses his best stage voice and draws on his carnival days when 
talking up the tome 
in this age of trivial pursuit this is the archetypal 
ultimate not penultimate compendium of knowledge he said 
i dont think any household should be without one particularly 
if there is a child in school or if one of the parents has ever 
gone to school or if theyve known anyone who can spell the word 
school

vice president george bush suggested on 
tuesday that controversies swirling around the reagan 
administration are hurting him in presidential polls but he said 
he wasnt worried about it 
on one of those matters the irancontra affair bush struck 
back hard accusing democrats of leaking scurrilous allegations 
against him that arent true 
youve had endless investigations each one with a lot of 
democrats trying to find something wrong and they havent 
bush told reporters in fresno the american people are fair they 
know when someone is telling the truth 
bush singled out sen john kerry dmass saying kerrys 
subcommittee is the source of the latest allegation to link bush 
aides to a contra arms network involving drug deals kerry denied 
that he or his staff leaked any committee information 
on another controversy bush refused to answer repeated 
questions about a possible administration deal with panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega while admitting a senate resolution 
condemning a deal reflects public opinion 
i think it expresses a lot of the strong feeling out there 
across the country on that matter very strong bush said 
president reagan when asked about the reported deal that would 
drop charges against noriega if he steps down told reporters at 
the white house were negotiating right now and therefore i 
cant comment on negotiations that are under way i have to say 
that i think that much of what many of you have been dealing with 
as a story is based on some kind of leaks or misinformation 
because there are no facts to sustain it 
bush talked about agriculture tuesday touring an irrigation 
center at california state university at fresno a fresh fruit 
processing plant and an orchard 
the vice president professed not to be concerned about a cbs 
newsnew york times poll putting him 10 points behind likely 
democratic nominee michael dukakis 
i dont worry about it the election is 5 months away he 
told reporters on the college campus 
the poll put bush at 39 percent and dukakis at 49 percent in a 
prospective fall matchup numbers bush admitted were not good news 
no they werent he said i feel about like i did about 
how opinion polls looked in new hampshire 24 hours before the 
polls opened i was 8 points back and i won by 10 they were off by 
18 points 
so what you do when the polls dont look good you work hard 
bushs negative ratings were high in the poll thirtythree 
percent said they had a favorable view of bush and 35 percent said 
they had an unfavorable view while voters are less familiar with 
dukakis his favorable rating stood at 38 percent and unfavorable 
at 14 percent 
asked if the administrations recent problems particularly 
with noriega and the investigation of attorney general edwin meese 
iii have contributed to his high negatives bush agreed 
you may have put your finger on something there he said 
later in los angeles bush added it could an accumulation of 
current events but i dont worry about it ive learned not to 
live on these polls 
however bush campaign manager lee atwater said that the 
negative ratings can change quickly in a presidential campaign 
bush spokesman pete teeley added that dukakis has some 
advantages with a race still under way 
dukakis is in a very enviable position he is scoring a knock 
every tuesday while we have no opponentsand we have suffered in 
the polls said teeley 
bush argued that the general election battle has not been joined 
the thing hasnt really started in terms of democrats versus 
republicans and we havent gotten any of that in focus and it wont 
be until after the convention bush said 
he said that his focus on republican groups will change as the 
fall race gets started 
in a primary you go where the primary votes are bush said 
i think we have to reach out the best we can to all voters i 
made that point clear to a group of hispanic leaders well 
start doing more of that 
on agriculture bush said the outlook had improved for farmers 
i know the 80s have been tough years for farmers very tough 
years for some he told a gathering of supporters in fresno 
but there is strontg evidence now that the 85 farm bill is 
working 
bush said farmers had convinced him to talk to the immigration 
and naturalization service about the guest workers program that 
allows mexicans to come into the country to harvest crops 
i recognize how important guest workers are not only to you 
and harvesting crops but to the country and i support the 
provision of the immigration reform bill that allows you an 
adequate supply he said 
he also slammed dukakis for calling for a greater federal role 
in allocating water the lifeblood of california agriculture 
i was interest to see that gov mike dukakis assert a federal 
interest in allocating water rights in the west you want to see 
the sagebrush rebellion start up all over again listen to that 
kind of talk its the states that should have the major say and 
the major control not the federal government bush said

first interstate bank tower was extinguished by the time 
firefighters arrived late monday afternoon and no damage or 
injuries were reported assistant fire chief david sloan said

killed a janitor who became trapped in a fiery elevator and injured 
40 others several of them firefighters overcome by smoke

a civil rights commission hearing on aids 
turned surreal when gay protesters in clown masks hummed america 
the beautiful shouted insults at witnesses and commissioners and 
held up wristwatches to denote that time is running out for 
aids victims 
mondays hearing became so heated that one witness said he would 
rather die in the street than in the hospice run by another 
and a third said gay pressure groups are thwarting public health 
efforts 
the hearing also featured feuding commission members denouncing 
each others remarks and tangling with witnesses over racism 
sexual addiction and other issues with little direct relation 
to the subject at hand aids and discrimination 
at one point the 65 gay protesters in clown masks turned their 
backs on the proceedings to show their disdain for the commission 
and its efforts 
this is a waste of time said duncan osborne one of the 
protesters this is a waste of money 
osborne said the money would be better spent testing new drugs 
or educating people on how to avoid getting aids 
the commission proposed its hearings part of a larger study in 
a memo that discussed state sodomy laws in the same footnote as 
biblical denunciations of homosexuality 
osborne and others said the commission could play a legitimate 
role investigating employment housing health care and insurance 
discrimination against aids victims but they said the panel has no 
business reopening debate on how aids is transmitted or hearing 
inflammatory testimony from witnesses who are not medical or public 
health experts 
jim johnson executive director of a religious hospice in long 
beach calif called beyond rejection said homosexual activists 
had bombed his hospice and threatened him because he had left 
behind the narcissism and contempt of my earlier life as a 
homosexual 
jeffrey levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force noted the prevailing medical belief that a homosexual 
orientation cannot be changed 
if i had to make the choice between dying in the street and 
dying in his hospice id choose dying in the street levi said 
dr david pence a university of minnesota radiologist vietnam 
war protester and civil rights worker alleged that gay pressure 
groups have thwarted public health efforts to stop the spread of 
aids 
twentyfive years ago it was southern bullies in jeans that we 
had to fight now its northern smoothies in ties pence said 
an outraged levi demanded a retraction and an apology 
he has just likened us to the ku klux klan levi said 
that is so deeply offensive that i question whether i can 
continue to sit at the same table with him 
he said gay people oppose reporting techniques which identify 
victims by name because they fear discrimination of all types even 
prosecution for violating sodomy laws if anyone finds out they are 
victims or carriers of aids 
if there were federal laws barring discrimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation levi said we wouldnt have to be here 
he said the commission should recommend that type of law and 
recommend extending to the private sector a law barring 
discrimination against handicapped people who are not a public 
health threat 
dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases said public health officials had not been 
influenced by any lobbying groups in determining aids policy or 
interpreting aids research 
it is totally preposterous to even imagine that any scientist 
i know would take a stand on how the virus is transmitted based 
on pressure he said the evidence is overwhelming 
teenage pregnancy babies with aids and incest in migrant 
families were among the concerns discussed by commissioners and 
witnesses so was sexual addiction a condition pence described 
as likely to lead to aids and defined as engaging in compulsive 
coital behavior outside of marriage

bargain agreements for each 
peter john milano 62 of westlake village pleaded guilty in 
march to involvement in a criminal enterprise in which he committed 
two acts of racketeering in return he was guaranteed a 6year 
sentence rather than a possible 20 years 
milano who owns rome vending co also was assured that he 
would have other federal charges against him dropped and that he 
was not a subject or target of any other federal investigation 
while milano pleaded guility he and others indicted have 
maintained they do not belong to the mafia 
when the indictment against milano and his associates was 
announced last year us attorney robert c bonner said the main 
body of la cosa nostra in los angeles has been severely gutted 
attorney general edwin meese called it the most significant 
organized crime case on the west coast in a decade 
also sentenced were milanos brother and reputed underboss 
carmen joseph milano 58 of the los angeles district of tarzana 
to six months charles caci 51 an entertainer who uses the name 
bobby milano to one year one day and his brother vincent caci

57 to 10 years 
all pleaded guilty to extortion and conspiracy nunez also 
pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine and cino also 
pleaded guilty to making false statements 
also sentenced was john demattia 51 of sherman oaks demattia 
who pleaded guilty to conspiracy conspiracy to make a false 
statement on a loan application and wire fraud was given 3 years 
3 days in prison 
the indictment involved violations of the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations statute the los angeles case 
was one of several rico indictments nationwide that stemmed from a 
1982 crackdown on organized crime 
the indictment followed an fbi investigation during which milano 
allegedly ordered the killing of two suspected informants the 
murders never occurred because of tips from informants the 
indictment said

attorney general edwin meese iii is turning to 
an outside public relations consultant to improve his image after 
firing the justice departments chief spokesman prompting 
accusations by conservatives that he wants blind loyalty 
despite the departments annual 17 million public affairs 
budget it is negotiating a contract with an employee of the public 
relations firm hill amp knowlton to help depict meese as a tough 
drugbuster 
word of the planned outside public relations contract surfaced 
monday along with the news that meese had fired department 
spokesman terry eastland 
at a news conference eastland said that with meese under 
criminal investigation since may 1987 it would be difficult for 
me to be as aggressive as he might like in defending the attorney 
general 
meese said he simply thought it was time for new leadership 
and denied that eastlands dismissal had anything to do with his 
own legal problems 
but department sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
eastland was fired friday for refusing to provide unconditional 
support to meese in the face of the criminal investigation 
in a letter to meese eastland said that you have expressed to 
me your desire to have as director of public affairs someone 
willing to aggressively defend you against in effect any and all 
criticism you have concluded that my efforts have not 
sufficed 
as soon as eastlands firing was disclosed the head of meeses 
speechwriting unit william schambra abruptly quit saying he was 
perplexed and deeply disturbed by the attorney generals 
decision 
the outside public relations contract is being negotiated with 
charles crawford of hill amp knowltons washington office 
hill amp knowlton chairman bob gray emphasized that the contract 
is to be a 60day arrangement with crawford personally on drug 
enforcement issues and that its not a contract with me or the 
firm 
however he also said ive always felt that whoever had 
eastlands position had too much to do on a daytoday basis to 
spend much time on departmental problems 
gray has close ties to the reagan administration but he denied 
having anything to do with eastlands dismissal saying it was 
news to me 
conservatives lamented the firing of eastland a staunch 
conservative who helped craft many of meeses most controversial 
speeches on subjects ranging from civil rights policies to supreme 
court rulings 
i think it is a severe blow to the overall effort of the meese 
justice department to change the conventional intellectual 
wisdom said conservative scholar bruce fein a former department 
official terry was devoted to challenging the liberal nostrums 
of the past 
meese has fallen prey to bad advice from those who confuse 
blind loyalty with good government said gary l mcdowell a 
political conservative and meeses former chief speechwriter he 
called the firing the single greatest mistake ed meese has made 
since becoming attorney general 
meese told reporters that there are times when you need new 
leadership in a particular division and thats what happened here 
he contradicted the statement in eastlands letter about a 
perceived lack of a sufficiently aggressive defense saying the 
dismissal had nothing to do with a defense of me 
meese replaced eastland with his no 2 spokesman patrick 
korten who told reporters he intends to be very aggressive about 
every part of the job 
meeses ethical conduct has been entirely aboveboard said 
korten i think hes a very ethical man i think hes a very 
moral man 
independent counsel james mckay has been investigating the 
attorney generals ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 
billion iraqi oil pipeline project meeses longtime friend e 
robert wallach is under indictment in the wedtech case 
mckay also has subpoenaed records of the 40000ayear job held 
by meeses wife ursula her salary with a washington charity is 
being paid by a wealthy washington family that leases offices to 
the justice department 
mckay is expected to issue a report shortly raising numerous 
questions about meeses ethical behavior and eastland said 
someone like me could not be indifferent to what might be 
contained or flow from the independent counsels report 
education secretary william bennett who once wrote a book with 
eastland immediately offered him a job at the department of 
education 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the ranking republican on 
the senate judiciary committee issued a statement saying he was 
concerned by the firing 
thurmond said eastland has a fine reputation and he added 
that the committee will hold hearings after the independent 
counsels investigation of meese is concluded

the senate is racing the clock in a bid to 
ratify the ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty in the dozen 
days remaining before president reagan meets with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
the last obstacles to beginning floor debate were swept away 
monday ending a process of intense scrutiny that began soon after 
the treaty was signed in early december 
three senate committees told senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva that last weeks agreement in geneva between 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze satisfactorily resolved disputes about how to 
implement the treatys onsite inspection provisions 
byrd then announced he would call up the treaty for debate 
sometime today 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty signed at 
the white house on dec 8 by reagan and gorbachev would require 
the elimination of all us and soviet missiles with a range of 
between 300 miles and 3400 miles 
the decision to begin senate floor action on the pact followed 
testimony in which shultz said that in the geneva talks we got 
what we needed and wanted 
shultz said that included both the onsite inspection and a 
soviet agreement that mediumrange weapons using such futuristic 
technology as particle beam generators are banned by the treaty 
both issues had delayed consideration of the treaty on the 
senate floor with byrd vowing not to schedule action until they 
were resolved 
byrd said monday that he had been assured by the senate foreign 
relations intelligence and armed services committees that the 
problems had in fact been resolved 
i feel satisfied that were justified in taking up the treaty 
and i plan to do so byrd said 
byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratified by the may 29 
opening of the moscow summit but could not guarantee it 
finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend on 
the nature of the debate and the number of amendments that are 
offered he said 
byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it but 
noted there may be some roadblocks 
for example he said that if president reagan vetoes the trade 
bill an attempt to override that action would take precedence over 
the treaty and would interrupt its consideration 
sen john warner rva said he may seek to make the soviet 
diplomatic note resolving the futuristic weapons issue a part of 
the treaty itself 
he said he would offer a reservation to the treaty of the kind 
that requires agreement by the soviet union before the pact can go 
into effect 
chief us arms control negotiator max kampelman told warner 
that would send a potentially disruptive message to the soviets 
that they cannot be trusted 
but warner said the issue had taken five weeks to resolve and 
should be nailed down 
testifying before the foreign relations committee on tuesday 
shultz reminded senators they shouldnt be alarmed at a rough spot 
here and there as the two superpowers struggle to put the treaty 
into action 
we are breaking new ground with this treaty shultz said 
onsite inspection is a major step forward in arms control 
agreements we shouldnt be surprised if this process isnt always 
smooth 
but he said that as a result of the geneva talks we and the 
soviets not only agree on the rights and obligations established in 
this treaty but also on procedures to carry them out 
the bottom line is that the verification provisions of this 
treaty get the job done he said 
in another development sen david boren dokla dismissing 
allegations by sen jesse helms rnc said there is no evidence 
that a recent test of a soviet sealaunched cruise missile from a 
landbased launcher violated the treaty because it flew less than 
the prohibited 300 miles

ancient rivers that once flowed across an 
earthlike mars may have harbored primitive forms of life that 
flourished briefly before the red planet turned bitterly cold and 
dry scientists say 
steve squyers a planetary scientist at cornell university said 
that most evidence now indicates that mars and the earth were very 
similar shortly after their formation some 45 billion years ago 
and that conditions that led to the formation of life on earth may 
also have existed on mars 
squyers was among the scientists discussing planetary research 
at a meeting monday of the american geophysical union in an 
interview he said the most likely place for finding proof of 
martian life is soil laid down billions of years ago when water is 
thought to have flowed freely across the planets surface 
we know that life developed on earth very early and we know 
that conditions on mars very early were if not earthlike were 
very much more earthlike than they are at the present squyers 
said 
no evidence of life on mars has been found so far in studies by 
satellites and by robot craft that landed there but squyers and 
others believe mars holds out that possibility and even if life 
never evolved there that finding also would be important 
if you dont find life youve found out that despite the fact 
that you had really earthlike conditions they werent earthlike 
enough to produce life he said that will provide more 
information on the type of conditions you must have to enable life 
to develop 
susan postawko of the university of hawaii said most scientists 
studying the planet now accept the idea that water once flowed on 
mars in massive rivers that cut channels across the surface she 
said that idea once was considered outrageous because of conditions 
on mars now 
its virtually impossible to have water flowing on mars under 
the current conditions said torrence johnson a jet propulsion 
laboratory scientist the planet has only seven onethousandths of 
the atmospheric pressure of earth and is very cold water would 
either evaporate or freeze said johnson 
but pictures taken in 1976 by the voyager spacecraft clearly 
showed river beds and this finally persuaded most experts that 
water once covered part of mars surface 
there is really no other way that the channels could have been 
formed said postawko at first it was thought they could be 
lava channels but the way they look is more like water channels 
there is no other abundant liquid that could have formed them 
the question now is she said how did mars change so 
dramatically from the time the rivers flowed 
the most popular consensus is that mars formed and outgassed a 
lot of carbon dioxide forming a greenhouse effect said postawko 
this would keep the planet warm enough for water to flow 
eventually though she said the water would react with the carbon 
dioxide forming carbonates a type of mineral as the mineral is 
formed carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere mars cooled 
slowly and dried and the earthlike beginning was snuffed out she 
said 
postawko said this evolution could have occurred in cycles of 
heating and cooling with volcanic action changing the atmospheric 
chemistry and allowing the cycle to restart time after time 
squyers postawko and johnson said few of the questions about 
mars and its history of water and perhaps life will be answered 
until explorers set foot there 
drill samples gathered from the flood plains of some river 
channels sighted in voyager pictures could determine the presence 
of carbonates and in theory could reveal fossilized primitive 
life forms 
squyers said there may also be water still trapped in a 
subsurface permafrost and that core samples taken from high 
latitudes on mars could prove this concept he said pictures 
indicate that at the martian poles there are frozen deposits of 
ice perhaps from water or carbon dioxide samples of this ice 
could give a chemical history of the planet 
ordinary martian soil taken from anywhere on the surface said 
squyers could answer questions about the weather effects that have 
scoured the red surface of mars over billions of years leaving it 
barren while on its sister planet earth life bloomed flourished 
and grew 
squyers postawko and johnson all made presentations monday on 
planetary research at the agu meeting

the defense has revealed that former national 
security adviser robert c mcfarlane is named as an unindicted 
coconspirator in the case against oliver l north and three other 
irancontra defendants 
mcfarlane was named in that capacity in the charge that the 
retired marine lieutenant colonel and three codefendants conspired 
to divert usiran armssale profits illegally to the nicaraguan 
rebels according to a defense brief filed monday in the case 
the names of mcfarlane and other unindicted coconspirators in 
the case are contained in a version of the indictment that was 
filed under seal in us district court 
but lawyers for north revealed mcfarlanes legal status in a 
request that north be tried separately from former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
norths three codefendants also filed motions for separate 
trials 
fawn hall norths former secretary at the national security 
council marine lt col robert earl norths aide at the nsc and 
joe fernandez also known as tomas castillo the cias former 
station chief in costa rica were also identified in the defense 
brief as unindicted coconspirators 
hall and earl are cooperating with walshs investigation under 
grants of immunity from prosecution 
the conspiracy count against all four defendants charges they 
conspired illegally to set up the clandestine armssupply network 
to the contras through a series of foreign companies with secret 
bank accounts in switzerland 
as part of the conspiracy the indictment charges north and 
poindexter made false statements to congress and destroyed nsc 
records to thwart an investigation when the irancontra affair 
became public in november 1986 
mcfarlane who resigned as national security adviser in late 
1985 has admitted to charges he gave congress false assurances 
that his staff specifically north was not involved in giving 
covert aid to the contras at a time when direct us military aid 
was prohibited 
mcfarlane traveled with north to tehran in may 1986 on an 
armsforhostages mission carrying a bible signed by president 
reagan and a cake baked in the shape of a key 
mcfarlane who is also cooperating with walshs investigation 
could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a 400000 
fine for his guilty plea to the misdemeanor charges 
the defense motions were filed on a day that prosecutors made 
another attempt to obtain nearly 3000 pages of diaries that north 
kept while he was a white house aide 
walsh who tried unsuccessfully to subpoena the documents during 
the investigation sought them during a routine request for any 
and all notebooks journals or ledgers kept by the defendants 
the defendants said they needed to be tried separately in order 
to use the congressional testimony of their codefendants to prove 
their innocence 
the defense contended that a joint trial would unfairly 
prejudice the cases against them because all the defendants 
except secord testified before congress under limited grants of 
immunity from prosecution 
the socalled use immunity grants prevent walsh from using the 
congressional testimony of individual defendants against them as 
evidence but a defendant can use the immunized congressional 
testimony of a codefendant to crossexamine that person during the 
trial 
the defense quoting a memo by walsh said that the testimony 
mcfarlane gave after norths appearance was likely tainted because 
it was given in direct response to norths statements to the 
irancontra committees 
neither mcfarlanes lawyer leonard garment nor james wieghart 
a spokesman for independent counsel lawrence e walsh would 
comment on the defense revelation 
hakim and secord meanwhile contended that they should be tried 
separately because they are not accused of giving false testimony 
to congress or participating in a coverup

the soviet news media found a diplomatic victory 
in the retreat from afghanistan portraying the soviet pullout as a 
triumphant end to eight years of aid to a neighbor in need 
the staterun press while conceding that military victory 
proved elusive nevertheless put a positive spin on the withdrawal 
that began sunday 
homeward the communist party daily pravda declared on its 
front page monday showing a smiling afghan officer chatting with a 
soviet major just before the majors departure for home 
we were heading for this for a long time and with 
difficulty pravda wrote but life with its imperious hand 
moves aside the most sincere strivings and spoils the bestlaid 
plans 
pravda depicted the withdrawal as a diplomatic triumph over 
countries that supported the anticommunist guerrillas in their 
battle against president najibs moscowbacked government 
the party daily claimed that the april 14 geneva accord that set 
the timetable for withdrawal was the result of opposition forces 
finally realizing that the war could not be won by military force 
alone 
we never laid claim to a military victory in afghanistan 
pravda said adding if we speak of defeats and victories then 
there is a victory too the return of our sons is a victory for 
perestroika 
perestroika refers to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
reform program aimed at rebuilding society 
television news coverage such as reports by the nightly news 
program vremya have focused on the ceremonial sendoffs given the 
soviet soldiers by the afghan government 
afghan soldiers and citizens were lined up on the streets of 
jalalabad when the soviets pulled out of their base there sunday 
and in kabul where about 1300 troops marched out on monday the 
first contingent to leave the country under the geneva accord 
but while he ceremonies took place gunfire could be heard in 
the distance a reminder that the war continues guerrilla factions 
have vowed to continue their fight to topple the marxist government 
the jalalabad departure and a message from the communist party 
leadership congratulating the troops topped vremya newscast sunday 
night but the ceremonies from kabul were carried late in mondays 
broadcast 
soviet media also have looked at the human side of the war 
noting the relief felt by families of soldiers serving in 
afghanistan 
notably absent from the coverage however has been any 
emotional display or questioning of the wisdom of having entered 
the war in the first place 
no interviews with anxious parents have taken place and even 
the departing soldiers depicted have been restrained in their 
enthusiasm over leaving the civil war behind 
the party message delivered to the soldiers on sunday thanked 
them for fulfilling their internationalist duty to the afghan 
government whose power remains threatened by guerrilla groups 
armed and trained by pakistan and the united states 
soviet officers also have told western reporters in afghanistan 
that they consider the afghan army capable of defending itself now 
the attention lavished on such comments has created the 
impression that withdrawing the 115000 soviet troops is a logical 
step in assisting afghanistan toward military independence 
a tass news agency commentary on monday contended the soviet 
departure could have been arranged much earlier if the other 
parties to the geneva agreement had acknowledged their errors 
earlier 
the agreement that called for the soviet withdrawal to start 
sunday was signed by afghanistan and pakistan with the united 
states and the soviet union agreeing to act as guarantors 
half the soviet troops are expected to be back on home ground by 
aug 15 the withdrawal must be completed within nine months 
the kremlin sent in tanks and troops on dec 27 1979 to back 
the sovietallied government against widespread insurgence the 
uprising was touched off by the april 1978 revolution that brought 
a marxist leadership to power

teamsters union executives met 
behind closed doors to discuss an orderly transfer of power while 
indicted president jackie presser undergoes cancer treatment an 
official said 
union leaders are supporting presser not vying for his job as 
head of the 17 millionmember union secretarytreasurer weldon l 
mathis said monday 
youre talking about a very dear personal friend of mine 
mathis said of questions about possible successors to presser if 
his illness proved to be lifethreatening i dont know of any 
power struggle 
presser 61 is hospitalized at the barrow neurological 
institute in phoenix reportedly for treatment of brain cancer he 
previously underwent surgery for a malignant tumor on his lung 
institute spokeswoman debra gelbart confirmed that presser was 
being treated but said no other information would be released 
labormovement specialist nick salvatore of cornell universitys 
school of industrial and labor relations said the nature of power 
ensures contenders for pressers job 
i think he wants to run things from the hospital but i dont 
know how hes going to do it salvatore said this is what 
former teamsters president jimmy hoffa was going to do from jail 
and frank fitzsimmons had other ideas 
if the incapacitation becomes permanent the question seems to 
be who will win the power struggle who will take over salvatore 
added but those arent the real issues the real issue is that 
the nations largest union has no internal democratic structure 
mathis discounted reports that pressers illness and his may 4 
start of a fourmonth leave of absence had sparked a power struggle 
this meeting was called to report to the board on the 
procedures to be followed in the absence of the general president 
to make sure we continue to operate in an orderly manner he said 
at least five members of the 18member executive committee 
failed to attend mondays meeting here but mathis denied that they 
were dissenting although some had wanted to meet in washington 
several were on vacation or ill and one excused himself because he 
was placing his wife in a hospital mathis said 
the committee is comprised of vice presidents presser and the 
secretarytreasurer 
mathis said he had not been told how presser was faring or given 
details of his condition which he described as lesions of the 
brain 
i know that he left a cleveland clinic and came out here for 
an evaluation of whether the condition was operable mathis said 
mathis said he did not know whether pressers leave of absence 
would last longer than four months but he added i dont expect 
him to be out longer than that 
presser is scheduled to stand trial on july 12 in us district 
court in cleveland on embezzlement and racketeering charges 
pressers attorneys have said he does not want to postpone the 
trial but was too ill to attend a hearing this week by us 
district judge george white to discuss pressers health the 
hearing was rescheduled for june 3 
presser is accused along with two other teamsters officials of 
siphoning 700000 in union funds to noshow employees from 
teamsters local 507 in cleveland presser remains 
secretarytreasurer of local 507 his hometown local 
presser who has been teamsters president since 1983 has 
pleaded innocent his attorneys say presser was a government 
informant and was authorized by the fbi to pay the socalled ghost 
employees

president reagans doctor has taken former 
white house chief of staff donald t regan to task for alleging 
that astrology might have played a part in the timing of the 
presidents 1985 operation for colon cancer 
at no time was astrology consulted presidential physician 
col john hutton said in a letter released monday by the white 
house 
hutton sent the letter to time magazine which printed excerpts 
from regans book for the record in the book the former 
presidential aide disclosed that nancy reagan consulted an 
astrologer for help in determining the presidents schedule 
although white house officials confirmed that the first lady had 
an interest in astrology they refused to point to specific 
incidents in which it was used 
a telephone call placed to the white house physician was not 
immediately returned 
hutton said in the letter that the subject of astrology never 
came up in the conversation he witnessed between the president and 
first lady about the timing of the cancer surgery 
regans book discusses a conversation he had with the first lady 
before the presidents july 1985 surgery in which she told regan 
the surgery might have to be delayed for a day and a half regan 
said he was concerned by that comment 
first that president reagans condition was more serious than 
his wife had been able to tell me over the phone and second that 
the first lady was choosing a date for surgery in consultation with 
her astrologer regan wrote 
hutton criticized regan for making that allegation 
unfortunately mr regan chose the second alternative as the 
most likely and on this false assumption provides the reader with 
the first element of incorrect information concerning an event he 
did not witness hutton said 
the physician an army colonel said that following an 
examination of the presidents colon on july 12 1985 a large 
suspicious mass or polyp was discovered four sites were 
biopsied and a presumptive diagnosis of cancer was made 
the presidents team of doctors recommended that the surgery be 
scheduled for the next day and the first lady agreed that we 
should proceed as soon as possible hutton wrote

hoses improperly installed by ambulance 
operators may have caused coolant to leak and set fire to engines 
ford motor co said after regulators were asked to order a recall 
a petition filed by a consumers group with the national highway 
traffic safety administration requested the recall of 16000 
19831987 ford e350 ambulances after reports of four engine fires 
in march and april 
in each case the vehicle emitted an antifreeze odor had a 
recent service history involving coolant loss or was identified as 
having a coolant line rupture after the fire said the petition 
by the center for auto safety a consumers group often critical of 
the auto industry and its regulators 
ford spokesman chuck snearly said monday the automaker was 
gathering information on the reports and will act accordingly 
in most of the cases ford had investigated the hoses had been 
replaced to reroute coolant to an auxiliary heater in the back of 
the ambulance snearly said 
the hoses that were used possibily werent up to ford 
specifications and in some cases might have been improperly 
routed snearly said some of the hoses werent properly 
attached 
nhtsa said it would respond to the petition within 120 days but 
would have no comment beforehand 
the ford e350 ambulances were recalled last year for repair of 
a fuel system problem that the center said caused 24 fires 
resulting in 15 injuries the four recent fires were in ambulances 
that had been repaired under the 1987 recall 
snearly said there was no connection between the reported 
coolant leaks and the earlier fuelsystem problem 
two of the coolanthose fires occurred in missouri and one each 
in minnesota and virginia the center said missouri attorney 
general william l webster last month warned the states ambulance 
services of the possibility of engine fires 
in other regulatory actions nhtsa said monday it had opened 
preliminary evaluations of alleged safety problems with 150000 
1988model chevrolet berettas made by general motors corp and 
400000 19831987 gm s10 and s15 compact trucks 
nhtsa said alleged failure of the left rearwheel spindle in the 
berettas could result in the loss of a rear wheel the agency had 
unconfirmed reports of two accidents resulting in one injury 
the s10s and s15s allegedly were liable to fracturing of the 
rear axle the agency said nhtsa had unconfirmed reports of four 
accidents three of which resulted in one injury each 
gm spokesman bill noack said the company was working on its 
response as in the past we will cooperate fully with nhtsa but 
i would mention that just because there is a preliminary 
evaluation it does not necessarily mean there is a defect noack 
said 
nhtsa also upgraded to an engineering analysis the next higher 
category of investigation its preliminary evaluations of alleged 
electrical fires in the 1987 ford aerostar vans and of stalling in 
fords 19861987 taurus and sable cars

president reagan last year accepted from four 
close friends a flat thing with a lot of little spikes valued 
at 745 his spokesman says 
marlin fitzwater offered that explanation monday for a harrow 
that turned up on reagans annual financial disclosure form the 
farm implement was a gift from mr and mrs earle jorgensen and mr 
and mrs william wilson longtime california friends of the 
president 
fitzwater described the harrow as a flat thing with a lot of 
little spikes just like that and it breaks up clods you pull it 
behind a tractor 
asked why the president accepted the harrow fitzwater replied 
you never know where a clod might appear 
the farm implement was among several gifts that the president 
and his wife nancy accepted including a 337 workbench that reagan 
got from another friend mrs henry salvatori 
the financial disclosure form masked the reagans true net 
worth since the value of their assets and holdings was reported 
merely in ranges such as from 15000 to 50000 
for instance reagans 688acre rancho del cielo in the santa 
ynez mountains near santa barbara calif purchased in 1974 for 
526000 and with 127000 in improvements eight years later was 
listed simply as being worth more than 250000 the highest 
category 
it was impossible to determine the value of the blind trust that 
holds the bulk of reagans investments it too was listed as 
being valued at over 250000 
reagan holds four life insurance policies the largest being 
worth no more than 100000 and the smallest worth up to 5000 
the form said two other polices are valued at up to 15000 
the nearly 4000 worth of gifts included an engraved crystal 
bowl valued at 1585 from the american association of neurological 
surgeons and a wool shawl and leather gloves valued at 360 for 
first lady nancy reagan from bernard arnault of paris the chairman 
of the board of christian dior 
reagan received gold cuff links valued at 800 from beverly 
hills jeweler marvin hime who made an identical set for soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
a silver and bronze statuette valued at 150 was accepted from 
italian president giovanni spadolini 
fitzwater said these are gifts that they are keeping and 
declaring under federal giftreceiving rules 
foreign gifts valued at over 180 have to be reported and 
domestic gifts worth 100 or more must be reported 
the financial disclosure form also showed that mrs reagan 
inherited at least 170000 in securities and trust assets from her 
mother edith luckett davis who died last year 
it said mrs reagan received 85000 worth of federal farm 
credit banks funding corp securities and 50000 in us treasury 
notes last year the assets were inherited by mrs reagan from her 
mother said white house spokesman bj cooper 
in addition the first lady received a 50 percent interest in a 
trust fund that had been set up for her mother by her mothers 
husband the late loyal davis the other half went to her brother 
dr richard davis 
the trust fund was valued at between 70000 and 165000 
meaning that mrs reagans share was between 35000 and 82500 
the form also showed that mrs reagan purchased 15000 worth of 
debtobligation bonds in an oil and gas enterprise tosco corp 
but it was unclear whether that was part of the first ladys 
inheritance 
apart from her inheritance mrs reagan bought 50000 in 
california state general obligation bonds rolling over the 
proceeds from state bonds that had matured last year

drivers of farm vehicles should be exempted 
from regulations being considered to implement a 2yearold federal 
law regulating commercial vehicles says an agriculture department 
official 
martin f buzz fitzpatrick jr head of the usdas office of 
transportation said monday that drivers of farm vehicles are not 
commercial drivers and should be excluded from the commercial motor 
vehicle act of 1986 
compared to nonfarm drivers they drive shorter distances 
fewer total miles and have a lower rate of involvement in fatal 
accidents he said the minimal risk presented by these drivers 
does not justify the burden that would be imposed on them or on 
enforcement officials if all the provisions of the act were to be 
enforced 
fitzpatrick said the law requires that the drivers of commercial 
vehicle with a gross weight of more than 26000 pounds have a 
single drivers license with a single driving record be tested for 
the type of vehicle driven and be required to notify their 
employer and home state of any traffic violations 
regulations to implement the law are currently under 
consideration by the transportation department 
fitzpatrick said the law gives the secretary of transportation 
authority to waive any class of drivers or vehicles from any or all 
of the laws provisions

a supreme court ruling that allows police to 
search discarded garbage without a warrant may encourage law 
enforcement officials to expand use of the unusual investigatory 
technique a civil rights organization says 
now that the police know the way is clear they may say gee 
what a good idea said arthur spitzer of the american civil 
liberties union 
law enforcement groups hailed the ruling 
jerald vaughn executive director of the international 
association of chiefs of police said were very pleased 
he said if the court had ruled the other way it certainly 
would have increased the difficulty of making investigations it 
certainly would not have made our job any easier 
by a 62 vote the justices ruled monday that the privacy rights 
americans enjoy do not extend to discarded garbage 
it is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at 
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals 
children scavengers snoops and other members of the public 
said justice byron r white for the court 
the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes 
from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by 
any member of the public he said 
the justices reinstated charges against a california man and a 
female companion accused of possessing drugs for purpose of selling 
them police discovered evidence of narcotics in garbage left at 
the curb for collection outside the mans home in laguna beach 
mondays ruling however does not condone warrantless police 
searches of garbage left on private property in close proximity to 
the home 
the constitutions fourth amendment which generally requires 
police to get court search warrants does not cover instances when 
there is no legitimate expectation of privacy white said 
even the refuse of prominent americans has not been 
invulnerable he remarked he pointed out that in 1975 a reporter 
for the national enquirer seized five bags of garbage from the 
sidewalk outside the home of thensecretary of state henry 
kissinger in a fashionable washington neighborhood 
but justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said 
scrutiny of anothers trash is contrary to commonly accepted 
notions of civilized behavior 
i suspect therefore that members of our society will be 
shocked to learn that the court the ultimate guarantor of liberty 
deems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private 
lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become 
public brennan said 
he added a search of trash like a search of the bedroom can 
relate intimate details about sexual practices health and personal 
hygiene as well as financial and professional status political 
affiliations and inclinations private thoughts personal 
relationships and romantic interests 
in other action the court 
let stand a ruling in a case from new jersey that pregnant 
prison inmates have the right to free abortions if they can not 
afford them a lower courts ruling in the case is binding on all 
local state and federal prisons in new jersey delaware and 
pennsylvania 
turned down the appeal of former yale university professor 
vladimir sokolov who is fighting efforts to strip him of us 
citizenship government lawyers say he wrote vicious attacks on 
jews for a russianlanguage newspaper controlled by the nazis 
during world war ii 
ruled unanimously that the federal communications commission 
has exclusive authority to regulate the technical quality of cable 
television signals the court refused to let state and local 
officials impose more stringent requirements

a study commissioned by education secretary 
william bennetts own department disputes his frequent claim that 
teacher unions are a major obstacle to school reform 
bennett had no comment monday on the rand corp study which was 
financed by his office of educational research and improvement 
the report teacher unions and education reform said that 
unions generally have accommodated reforms even when they had 
misgivings 
but it also said rankandfile teachers are unwilling to accept 
reforms as a substitute for breadandbutter improvements in their 
basic working conditions 
eighty percent of americas nearly 23 million public school 
teachers belong to unions and 60 percent of them are covered by 
collective bargaining contracts 
the presidents of both the national education association and 
the american federation of teachers expressed delight at the rand 
findings which were based on a review of more than 150 teacher 
contracts and an analysis of reform legislation in six states 
aft president albert shanker said the researchers found that at 
the local level unioninitiated reforms can only succeed in 
places where the union is strong enough to risk change 
that means that traditional breadandbutter items like 
clean safe classrooms and high quality teaching materials have to 
be secured he said 
mary hatwood futrell the nea president said collective 
bargaining and school reform are compatible teachers through 
their organizations are trying to work with legislatures and with 
school districts to bring about reform she said 
bennett has charged repeatedly that obstructionist unions are 
the major obstacle to improving americas schools last month in 
his own report american education making it work bennett 
said sound education reforms are threatened by the determined 
opposition they elicit from those who claim that fixing the 
schools will first require a fortune in new funding 
almost without fail wherever a worthwhile school proposal or 
legislative initiative is under consideration those with a vested 
interest in the educational status quo will use political muscle to 
block reform bennett said 
the rand researchers lorraine m mcdonnell and anthony pascal 
did not mention bennett by name but said despite charges to the 
contrary teacher unions have not been a major obstacle to 
educational reform 
instead they have tried to accommodate demands for reform 
even in those instances where a specific reform initiative has 
run counter to their organizational interests or has been at odds 
with the professional judgment of their members 
it said the unions accommodation and acceptance was 
critical to smooth implementation of school reforms if teacher 
unions had wanted to block reform policies they could probably 
have done so quite successfully in many local districts 
but in some cases accommodation occurred by default because 
state and local organizations lacked the resources to oppose reform 
policies the study said 
the researchers at rand a santa monica calif thinktank 
analyzed 151 teacher contracts reached between 1970 and 1985 and 
studied the reforms enacted in six states arizona california 
florida georgia minnesota and pennsylvania 
in most of the states the teacher organizations made a 
conscious decision to mute their opposition and to accommodate the 
policies espoused by others the report said they did not want 
to be viewed as intransigent or antireform 
while the aft quickly moved toward a position of leadership in 
shaping new approaches to teacher professionalism the nea shifted 
from initial opposition to some reform proposals on to 
accommodation and finally to a position where it now supports and 
encourages local affiliates to experiment with new approaches to 
professionalism the report said 
efforts to professionalize teaching in rochester ny dade 
county fla jefferson county ky and elsewhere have included 
such steps as giving classroom teachers a larger say in school 
governance and curriculum decisions as well as creation of a new 
category of master teachers

an afghan government that includes 
marxists and moslems is within reach even though the guerrillas 
have vowed to seize the country when the soviets leave a united 
nations official said 
undersecretarygeneral diego cordovez who mediated the april 14 
agreement for the removal of soviet troops said he has begun 
promoting contacts among disparate afghan groups in an effort to 
form a broadbased government 
i think there is more communication now between the afghans 
themselves than you think he said told a news conference on 
monday the effects of the settlement and troop withdrawal are 
beginning to sink in 
about 1300 soviet soldiers pulled out of the northeastern city 
of jalalabad on sunday the first contigent of troops to withdraw 
under the international accord signed in geneva 
the soviets intervened militarily in december 1979 to help the 
marxist government battle the predominately moslem guerrillas who 
have been backed by the united states and pakistan 
under the geneva accord all of the 115000 soviet military 
personnel in afghanistan are to be withdrawn within nine months 
the agreement between afghanistan and pakistan with guarantees 
by the united states and soviet union also calls for an end to 
outside interference and repatriation of more than 5 million afghan 
refugees in pakistan and iran 
the agreement also says the desirable government is a 
broadbased government involving all segments of afghan society now 
living inside and outside the country cordovez said that is 
what i hope will be achieved 
afghan guerrillas who received support from the united states 
and pakistan have rejected the accords and have vowed to continue 
fighting they did not participate in the geneva negotiations 
cordovez declined to answer questions about allegations that 
arms for the rebels are still being moved into afghanistan mainly 
from pakistan 
he said if a formal complaint is lodged about such arms 
shipments my approach would be to discuss the problem with 
whoever is involved on a casebycase basis 
a un peace mission in the country will have 50 unarmed 
military officers headquartered in kabul the afghan capital and 
islamabad pakistan where many of the guerrilla groups have 
offices the mission also will have a civilian support staff of 40 
to 50 people 
cordovez confirmed the 50 military officers now are deployed 
and said 10 were in jalalabad as soviet troops began to leave 
sunday 
members of the un mission are from austria canada denmark 
fiji finland ghana ireland nepal poland and sweden 
cordovez said the top un officer in the area maj gen rauli 
helminen of finland was assured by afghanistan and pakistan that 
they would implement the geneva accords 
we have been given full assurances that we will observe this 
withdrawal operation and on the day in which they soviet 
troops cross the border there will be united nations military 
officers on the border between afghanistan and the soviet union

when george bush talks about republican 
presidents who protected the environment he praises theodore 
roosevelts accomplishments and mentions richard nixon but the 
vice president doesnt cite ronald reagan 
the gop nomineeapparent usually keeps himself wellaligned with 
reagan administration policies but on monday he began to put some 
space between his campaign and reagans environmental record 
i dont think weve been doing enough to protect our 
environment in recent years we need to do more he said 
bush was also blasting a published report that linked his 
national security adviser donald gregg with a contra armssupply 
operation that was bankrolled with drug money 
bush accused sen john kerry of massachusetts who chairs a 
senate subcommittee that has been looking into the allegations of 
leaking slanderous information about the matter 
i would challenge sen kerry to show some evidence and 
stop leaking out information thats not fair or true he told 
reporters in seattle on monday 
kerry could not be reached for comment monday night but the 
washington post quoted him in todays editions as denying that he 
or his staff was responsible the most recent report about the 
matter appeared in newsweek magazine 
some magazine elects to reprint garbage bush said i get 
annoyed some insidious political game is going on 
on environmental issues the vice president was distancing 
himself from reagan 
a new administration is a time for change a time for renewal 
i will put the very best people we can find to work on our 
environmental agenda bush told the greater seattle chamber of 
commerce 
a bush administration will enforce environmental laws 
aggressively putting the responsibility for the cleanup where it

a film debating the leadership of josef v stalin 
premiered on nationwide television after censors held it back for 
eight months and the director was reprimanded for putting the 
nations history on public trial 
the process discusses the late dictators repression of real 
and imagined political opponents mass deportation of people who 
resisted the spread of soviet rule in the baltic and the ukraine 
and other topics 
most of the soviets interviewed in the twohour documentary 
aired monday night condemned stalins 29year leadership but there 
were others who saw him as the force that transformed a peasant 
nation ravaged by revolution and war into an industrial and 
military power 
instead of wasting time and talking about how to catch up with 
the highly developed countries it was necessary to make people 
work an academician identified as medovar stated in the film 
how could it have been done by persuasion no only in this 
way 
anna bukharinlarina widow of nikolai i bukharin had harsh 
words for stalin he was cunning perfidious artful 
vindictive ms larina said i consider him a criminal 
bukharin an early member of the communist party politburo was 
expelled in 1929 for disagreeing with stalin and was executed in 
1938 after a show trial 
excerpts of the heated condemnations of showtrial prosecutor 
andrei vyshinsky followed a film clip in which stalin raises a 
rifle and takes aim 
the juxtaposition apparently was director igor belyaevs way of 
symbolically saying that stalin was behind the deaths of bukharin 
and other revolutionary contemporaries of soviet founder vladimir 
i lenin 
ms larina read a letter written by her husband when he knew 
stalin had targeted him the letter appealed to a future leader to 
clear bukharins name and expose stalins crimes against the soviet 
people 
ms larina said she memorized the letter and recited it to 
herself each day when she was in a labor camp following bukharins 
death the letter was made public last november bukharin was fully 
rehabilitated in february 
the second half of the film opened with footage from the late 
1920s showing zealots blowing up churches and driving wagons over 
crops in the brutal collectivization campaign the footage was 
accompanied by historian vladimir tikhonovs claim that the drive 
was carried out at a barbaric pace 
veterans of the 1917 bolshevik revolution that brought the 
soviets to power told of bread rationing and hunger that followed 
collectivization but argued among themselves about the need for 
the drive and about its success 
in a discussion after scenes from an antistalinist play 
dictatorship of conscience young people said that some were 
confused by the rejection of their past 
the review and rejection of stalinism carried in articles in 
the soviet press over the past year is seen as part of mikhail s 
gorbachevs perestroika campaign that aims to rebuild society and 
root out stagnation 
komsomolskaya pravda published an article on saturday saying the 
film prepared in advance of last novembers 70th anniversary of 
the revolution was held back by censors for eight months and that 
director belyaev was reprimanded for the heavy criticism in the 
documentary 
the newspaper concluded that the soviet union would not have 
been ready for the film without first facing the facts about 
stalins legacy in the smaller doses that have been administered 
over the last year 
there is no confidence that this will last a young soviet 
worker said of gorbachevs social reforms we dont know what 
will be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and nobody will tell 
you what he really thinks

international airport from tegucigalpa on tan airlines flight 808 
according to court records 
an affidavit said that during an examination of regalados 
luggage a us customs inspector discovered a white powdery 
substance secreted inside 10 packages surrounded by coffee and 
wrapped in plastic concealed inside pants legs and other clothing 
in his suitcase tests showed that the substance contained 2585 
pounds of cocaine the affidavit said 
a narcotics agent who spoke on the condition that he not be 
identified said cocaine smugglers sometimes use coffee to block 
detection by dogs 
us magistrate peter palermo scheduled a second hearing for 
thursday regalado was being held in the federal metropolitan 
correctional center 
the honduran foreign ministry meanwhile announced monday night 
it suspended regalados diplomatic status and that us 
authorities were free to prosecute 
if convicted regalado would be liable for the corresponding 
legal sanctions in honduras and the united states said eugenio 
castrol a spokesman for the honduran foreign ministry in

denied the report 
leon kellner the us attorney in miami called the case a 
tragedy 
it shows what drugoriented money will do in the western 
hemisphere said kellner who also is prosecuting panamanian 
military leader gen manuel antonio noriega on drug trafficking 
charges no one is immune from the lure of druggenerated money 
not even an ambassador 
honduras experienced an outbreak of antiamerican sentiment 
after april 5 when juan ramon matta 43 considered an 
international cocaine kigpin was arrested and whisked out of the 
country

vice president salvador laurel today 
called for a national referendum to decide whether american 
military bases can remain in the philippines after 1991 
the united states and the philippines are holding talks on the 
1947 agreement under which the americans maintain six installations 
here including clark air base and the subic bay naval base 
the outcome is expected to determine whether the manila 
government will allow the bases to remain after the agreement 
expires in september 1991 
in an interview with radio station dzrh laurel said today 
it is to the longrange interest of both nations that we 
should know the sentiments of the filipino regarding the military 
bases we had been arguing and debating on this issue since 1947 
almost 41 years we should end the debate once and for all through 
a national referendum 
the filipino constitution says any extension of the bases 
agreement must be through a formal treaty subject to approval by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition is strong 
the constitution gives congress the option of referring the 
issue to the electorate in a national referendum 
on monday foreign secretary raul manglapus said the americans 
should pay more for use of the bases and if they refuse they 
should go the philippines receives about 180 million a year for 
use of the bases manglapus is chief of the philippine panel which 
is negotiating on the bases 
the chief american negotiator us ambassador nicholas platt 
has said that budget constraints may make it hard for washington to 
provide a substantial increase 
us officials say they are working with japan west germany and 
other american allies to put together a major new aid package for 
the philippines 
president corazon aquino has said she does not want the new aid 
linked to the future of the bases she has pledged to honor the 
bases agreement through 1991 but refuses to say if she will 
support an extension

a crowded cable car heading down one of the 
citys steepest hills in light rain rammed the rear of a truck at a 
stop light near fishermans wharf on monday injuring at least 31 
people 
i was sitting inside when the brakeman said hold on hold 
on i held on then we hit we were going very fast down the 
hill said esther breckenridge of st charles mo favoring a 
bruised leg 
the accident occurred at the intersection of hyde and bay 
streets a few blocks from the popular tourist attractions on 
fishermans wharf 
at least 29 people were taken to hospitals and two were treated 
at the scene five people were admitted to the hospital with 
fractures but no one was seriously injured said san francisco 
general hospital spokeswoman gloria rodriguez 
witnesses told police the cable car which normally moves at a 
maximum 9 mph seemed to accelerate as it moved down one of the 
steepest hills on the 115yearold system in a drizzle it struck 
the rear of a kingston contracting co cherrypicker repair 
truck hurling inside passengers forward and tossing those riding 
outside to the pavement 
on dec 3 1967 at the same intersection a cable car careened 
into several automobiles killing two people and injuring 43 
i saw the trolley coming down the hill very fast and then it 
stopped and people starting flying out said a woman clerk at a 
nearby dry cleaning shop who declined to give her name 
by the time we got to the bottom of the hill we were going 30 
or 40 miles per hour when we hit said jed porter of kansas city 
mo who was wrapped in a blanket 
but municipal railway george newkirk said all systems on the car 
seemed to be operating properly 
everything that was supposed to work worked but we werent 
able to stop he said that could be caused by the weather or 
some other things that we are going to be checking for the next 
couple of days to see exactly what happened whether it was 
mechanical failure or just a freak accident 
he also said it was unlikely that the car was traveling as fast 
as witnesses reported 
he said the cable cars gripman gerald bolden has been with 
muni since 1981 and has a clean record but oakland television 
station ktvu reported monday night that bolden had been a cable car 
gripman only two weeks and received a month of training for the 
position 
there was no answer at kingstons san francisco offices the 
truck driver declined to give his name or to comment except to 
say i dont feel good 
at the scene the front of cable car no 13 was ripped from the 
car and the rear of the truck was crushed 
cable cars one of the citys greatest treasures and a hugely 
popular tourist attraction operate by using a mechanical grip to 
grab a moving cable the car is stopped by using a friction brake 
in the cable slot an emergency brake consisting of a metal spike 
jammed into the slot was welded into the slot by the heat created 
by the moving car although it had to be cut loose with a torch it 
failed to halt the car 
the system designed by andrew s hallidie was shut down for 20 
months for a 58 million overhaul in 1982 in march the powell 
street line celebrated its 100th birthday

a securities and exchange commission lawyer 
who says the office had so many affairs going on that it operated 
as a brothel may soon be clinching her legal victory over the 
agency after winning the first round in court 
sec chairman david ruder said monday that sec lawyers were 
scheduled to meet today with counsel for catherine broderick who 
had asked ruder to discuss a way to avert a lengthy battle in the 
federal appeals court 
us district judge john h pratt ruled friday that ms 
broderick who worked for five years in the secs washington 
regional office suffered sexual harassment by being forced to work 
in a hostile environment 
pratt found that female employees who had sexual or other social 
relationships with managers of the regional offices enforcement 
division received promotions positive evaluations and cash bonuses 
but ms broderick received negative evaluations threats of 
dismissal and eventually a transfer when she complained about 
having to work in a hostile work environment 
ms broderick told reporters monday she hopes her former 
supervisors will be fired for using the office as a sexual 
playground 
the office operated as a brothel she said 
the affairs were carried on at the office and flaunted in 
front of other employees broderick told reporters they went 
out for threehour lunches and used the office for rendezvous after 
work and on weekends 
ruder meanwhile said in a statement that he was concerned 
about the implications of the broderick decision 
indications of a possible settlement are a marked departure from 
the secs previous stance in the case during the trial which took 
place before ruder became chairman the sec had branded ms 
broderick as paranoid pratt specifically rejected that 
assertion 
pratt scheduled a may 26 hearing to determine what sanctions to 
impose against the sec which is likely to include an order that 
ms broderick receive promotions the judge ruled she was denied 
promotions even though she met eligibility requirements 
although ms broderick herself was the victim of only isolated 
incidents of direct sexual overtures conduct of a sexual nature 
was so pervasive that it can reasonably be said that such 
conduct created a hostile or offensive work environment which 
affected the motivation and work performance of those who found 
such conduct repugnant and offensive pratt said 
ms broderick and attorneys s beville may and lawrence king 
called on ruder to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the 
agency officials the judge said the officials gave testimony that 
was deserving of little credence 
ruders statement noted that a determination whether to appeal 
would be made by the entire commission 
pratts ruling included a finding that former sec chairman john 
shad now us ambassador to the netherlands and executive 
director george kundahl took no action after learning of ms 
brodericks complaints

william rathje can breath a lot easier because 
of a supreme court ruling although the garbage will smell the same 
as he rummages through the trash of tucson 
the university of arizona professor is a 42yearold 
archaeologist who studies garbage for what it reveals about modern 
civilization hes a garbologist 
rathjes 30 students spend their class time sorting through 
sacks brought in from selected tracts by city sanitation workers 
the contents are logged into 185 categories 
the supreme court ruled monday in a narcotics case that once 
garbage is put out for curbside collection it is not entitled to 
privacy in other words its ok for someone else to rummage 
through it 
if the court had ruled the other way said rathje that would 
have made it impossible to sort garbage period without the 
permission of each and every individual homeowner in the 
community 
but rathje says he and his students are not interested in 
snooping on individual homeowners we never have any tie directly 
to any household he said 
what is learned from all this for one thing who contributes 
what to the hazardous waste problem 
lower income neighborhoods tend to do a lot of home auto 
repair so they tend to dump a lot of used motor oil spark plugs 
and batteries rathje said in a telephone interview from tucson 
middle income neighborhoods do a lot of home fixups and there 
are paints stains and varnishes in the waste upper income 
families spend a lot more time gardening therefore pesticides 
herbicides and fertilizers are thrown out in large quantities 
rathje who began this kind of research in 1973 said the first 
bag he personally sorted contained a cooked tbone steak wrapped in 
a paper towel another time a bag contained the entire contents of 
a picnic hot dog rolls mustard hot dogs all still in their 
unopened packages 
i just have an image of a family at home deciding to go out on 
a picnic george takes the garbage out in a brown paper bag and 
martha takes the picnic out to the car they get there and find 
they brought the garbage 
those people probably had enough to eat anyway he conjectures 
because americans waste about 15 percent of the food they buy 
in tucson garbage amounts to 9500 tons a year he said 
the general accounting office in 1977 using our data calculated 
that in the united states we throw out enough food to feed all of 
canada if they would take our leftovers 
even though his research has gone on for 14 years rathje still 
is at the classifying site to oversee sorting the garbage 
you cant send your men out where you fear to tread he 
said if you dont have a feel for the data youre finished

carrie didnt captivate the critics or 
audiences but the 8 million musical about a troubled teenager 
with telekinetic powers set one kind of record 
it closed sunday after a brief run the most expensive flop in 
broadway history 
the reviews were not very good said spokesman jim 
baldassare and it wasnt just the new york times 
most of carrie is just a typical musicaltheater botch 
wrote frank rich the times chief drama critic and a majority of 
his colleagues agreed 
the show which played five performances and 16 previews at the 
virginia theater was budgeted at 7 million but an extra 1 
million was spent when the opening date was postponed to allow for 
more rehearsals 
the show did not have a big advance sale according to 
baldassare and lost some 500000 worth of theater party business 
that was canceled after the reviews came out 
an 8 million price tag for a big broadway musical is not 
unusual today the phantom of the opera and starlight 
express both of which are still running cost that much 
until carries fast exit the most expensive flops on 
broadway have lost between 5 million and 6 million among the 
shows in that category were the 1986 musical rags the 1986 bob 
fosse musical big deal grind a burlesque musical that had 
a short run in 1985 and singin in the rain a broadway version 
of the popular movie 
carrie was based on the stephen king horror novel about a 
girl who has the power to move and destroy objects she is 
tormented by her mother a religious fanatic who refuses to allow 
her daughter to go the prom 
the show starred betty buckley as the mother and 17yearold 
linzi hateley in the title role miss buckley who portrayed 
carries sympathetic teacher in the movie carrie came into the 
show after its prebroadway tryout in england she replaced barbara 
cook who left last march after its run at stratforduponavon 
carrie was produced by friedrich kurz a west german 
businessman and the royal shakespeare company one of britains 
leading theater troupes the rscs involvement was criticized

the washington times a politically 
conservative newspaper says attorney general edwin meese iii 
should resign because he has destroyed the justice department 
while trying to defend his reputation 
the editorial today calling for meeses resignation is unusual 
because the newspaper has strongly supported the reagan 
administration it said meese should concentrate on the cult of 
character assassination that finally broke his spirit and weakened 
his judgment 
the newspaper said meeses firing of justice department director 
of public affairs terry eastland makes it clear that the 
embattled attorney general has decided to defend his reputation at 
all costs 
meese reportedly fired eastland because he wasnt defending him 
strongly enough against criticisms rising from an investigation of 
meese by independent counselor james mckay 
the newspaper said it was calling for meeses resignation 
because edwin meeses attempts to vindicate himself have 
destroyed his department 
the newspaper portrayed eastland as a meese loyalist who shared 
the attorney generals constitutional agenda it added that 
eastland had steadfastly battled against the sleazy insinuations 
that make up the bulk of the political case against edwin meese

president reagan personally approved a new 
offer that could allow panamas gen manuel noriega to remain in 
power while dropping drug charges against him for at least a year 
the los angeles times reported 
noriega is expected to decide in a day or two whether to accept 
the proposal the newspaper reported in todays editions citing 
unidentified reagan administration sources 
under the plan noriega would resign as commander of the 
panamanian defense forces in midaugust and leave the central 
american country for at least a year prosecutors would agree to 
drop drugtrafficking charges pending in florida and would not 
refile them while noriega was out of panama the newspaper said 
the panamanian legislature would be asked to pass a measure 
limiting the military chief to a single fiveyear term the times 
said 
but apparently noriegas favorites would remain in control of 
the country 
president manuel solis palma noriegas handpicked successor to 
eric delvalle would be allowed to retain office although the us 
would continue to recognize devalle as rightful holder of the post 
the newspaper said delvalle was ousted by noriega in february 
the times sources said reagan personally approved the offer 
which would be the latest in a series of repeatedly softened 
proposals noriega has ridiculed and rejected 
efforts to complete the negotiations are headed by charles j 
cooper an assistant attorney general and elliott abrams 
assistant secretary of state for latin america the sources said

the federal government plans to make federal 
transit subsidies contingent on local drug testing programs for 
city transit bus and subway operators 
alfred dellibovi head of the urban mass transit administration 
said monday that new regulations would require operators to submit 
to a broad range of drug tests including random sampling 
the federal regulations will call on transit officials to test 
for illegal use of drugs before employment after an accident for 
reasonable cause and under a random selection process according to 
dellibovi 
operators of buses and subway trains as well as others in 
sensitive jobs such as train dispatchers would be subject to 
the testing he said 
umta provides federal financial assistance to transit systems 
although a testing program would have to be imposed and 
administered by the local transit authorities

cutbacks brought on by budget cuts have 
lowered the price tag on the major weapons programs central to 
president reagans military buildup by 618 billion 
the pentagon said monday that at the close of the quarter on 
dec 31 the 95 key programs carried a combined price tag of 
75725 billion down 75 percent from the adjusted sept 30 1987 
total of 81905 billion 
the pentagon attributed the quarterly decline to seven programs 
that were either cancelled or significantly cut back in order 
to comply with fiscal 1988 spending limits adopted last fall in a 
compromise deficitreduction package 
among the seven were production of copperhead artillery rounds 
development and production of surveillance drone aircraft and 
development of a jamproof high frequency radio system those cuts 
respectively saved 4233 million 13 billion and 44 billion 
also killed were the groundlaunched cruise missile program and

hop over the wall after a dozen failed attempts now he makes a 
break almost daily said zoo director charles wikenhauser 
on sunday little cousin roamed the zoo grounds for hours and 
then returned evading traps set up for him

hunker down at this months summit in moscow the mayors of dixon 
ill and dickson siberia may be having a caucus of their own 
thanks to a bureaucratic snag the dickson delegation from 
siberia will delay its visit to the hometown of president reagan 
until at least the end of may 
the soviets had planned to arrive this week and the mayor of 
dickson nikolai kardamyshev was to have thrown out the first 
pitch at saturdays sandy koufax league opener 
but the soviet embassy information services department in 
washington dc notified dixon mayor james dixon on monday the 
soviet delegation will leave moscow not earlier than the end of 
may they will give the correct date when they receive their visas 
they dont have their visas yet 
the embassy confirmed that three people will be arriving the 
others are kardamyshev nikolai vicknevskii an interpreter and 
boris ivanov a journalist 
dixon said he believes the delay was because at least some of 
the visas were not applied for early enough he said the process 
takes 30 days 
the mayor invited the delegation after new years greetings were 
sent to the illinois town in 1987

a canadian researcher says an ozone hole may be 
developing in the stratosphere near the north pole each winter just 
as a similar hole is created over the south pole 
wfj evans a scientist with the department of environment in 
canada said monday that instruments carried aloft by balloons 
indicate a vast crater of depleted ozone forms near the north pole 
during the winter months and could act as a sink for ozone 
throughout the northern hemisphere 
evans said the ozone hole is shaped like a crater with high 
sides and a deep center the hole was discovered by releasing 
research balloons from a base at alert a canadian town near the 
north pole during the first four months of each year starting in 
1986 
evans who gave a paper on his findings at the spring meeting 
here of the american geophysical union said the antarctic ozone 
hole may be causing a decrease in the level of ozone protecting the 
whole southern hemisphere 
if there is a similar hole in the arctic it could influence 
the ozone in the northern hemisphere in the same way said evans 
he said if chemistry is playing role in the arctic ozone depletion 
we may start seeing five years from now an arctic hole becoming 
more and more evident 
the basic question he said is do we have a crack in the 
north end of the bathtub as well as the south end that is 
draining or depleting the ozone 
atmospheric ozone forms a natural barrier against the 
ultraviolet rays of the sun overexposure to this type of radiation 
is associated with skin cancer satellite and aircraft studies have 
found an ozone hole that develops during cold months over the south 
pole the loss of atmospheric ozone has been blamed on chemical 
reactions initiated by chlorofluorocarbons a type of chemical used 
a refrigerants and to make plastic foam 
evans said that due to a difference in weather patterns there 
is normally about 15 percent more ozone in the atmosphere over the 
arctic than over the antarctic the arctic ozone loss he said is 
much smaller 
even if the effect on ozone depletion is smaller in the 
northern hemisphere the effect is more important because that is 
where most of the people are he said the northern latitudes 
contain most of the land mass and the human population 
rr stolarski an atmospheric scientist at nasas goddard space 
center said evans findings are important but more study needs to 
be done to make sure that the ozone hole he has found is not just a 
cold weather phenomenon

for more than a decade a friendly face and 
message painted on the side of joe and gertrude carpenters white 
barn has graced the quiet wood county landscape and greeted 
travelers 
it has served as a landmark and way station of sorts for 
motorists seeking directions or shelter from driving snowstorms 
the barn needs painting now said carpenter a 75yearold 
retired farmer but when the new coats on this summer hes going 
to have the smiling face the friendly hi and the words joe 
and gertie repainted on the side of the barn 
after all the message is a sign of love for his wife who died 
last year after a long illness 
everytime i look at it i think of the old memories and the 
people who stopped and admired it he said 
we were married 51 years its a loss we did everything and 
went everyplace together carpenter said i miss her every 
day 
the 18footwide smiling face is visible from interstate 75 and 
ohio 582 which runs from haskins to woodville in northwestern 
ohio carpenters place is about 20 miles south of toledo 
the face on the barn was his wifes idea mrs carpenter known 
as gertie decided the face would be a fun gift to give her husband 
to celebrate their 41st wedding anniversary in 1976 a year later 
a sign painter added the names joe and gertie 
people laughed when they first saw it but it has become a 
local landmark he said 
the barnyard greeting has often been photographed and has become 
a point of reference when local folks give directions curious 
motorists often visit the carpenter farm to hear the story of the 
anniversary gift 
people stop and say they want to meet joe and gertie they ask 
about the face they say looking at it makes their day weve 
gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it over the years carpenter 
said people tell me dont ever take that face off the barn 
he said his wife was a trusting person who opened the house to 
stranded motorists 
during a 1978 blizzard he said 14 people spent the night in 
the carpenter home 
i remember that like it was yesterday all these people 
couldnt go any place because the highway was closed it was either 
spend the night here or in their cars he said then she got up 
in the morning and cooked breakfast for everybody 
she also had a keen sense of humor 
for some years two mannequins sat on the front porch of the 
carpenter home sometimes the mannequins sat there like a young 
couple courting mrs carpenter he said changed their clothing 
with the seasons 
motorists did double takes as they passed the porch but when 
gertie sold one of the mannequins the courtship was over 
these days carpenter spends most of his time making wooden 
clocks and ornaments two of his three children live nearby 
a few years ago the couple designed their headstone a 
detailed scene of the carpenter farm with the house mailbox and 
barn with the smiling face it also has the friendly hi from 
joe and gertie etched in stone 
she knew what it would look like but she died before she saw 
it he said

foreign reporters once lauded for 
their role in the ouster of president ferdinand marcos have gone 
from heroes to heels for alleged unflattering coverage of corazon 
aquinos philippines 
in recent weeks philippine columnists and government officials 
have accused the foreign press of scaring off foreign investors 
depicting manila as a decadent crimeridden slum and even paying 
communist rebels to stage ambushes 
the foreign pressbashing is a far cry from the adulation 
heaped on the international press for its coverage of the 
antimarcos movement 
many filipinos believed the presence of so many foreign 
reporters was responsible for marcos tame response to the february 
1986 uprising which brought his downfall 
a year after marcos ouster a private group with government 
backing even awarded certificates to foreign reporters who covered 
the 1986 uprising identifying them as heroes of the revolution 
philippine media have themselves been sharply critical of mrs 
aquinos stewardship as the country grapples with such problems as 
the communist insurgency widespread poverty inefficient 
bureaucracy deteriorating roads and bridges and a burgeoning 
population 
but the renewed sense of national pride that followed the marcos 
downfall also has shortened the patience of many filipinos for 
criticism by foreigners 
a former communist rebel gemma magallona was quoted as saying 
unidentified foreign reporters paid her group to stage an ambush in 
southeastern luzon and even provided weapons and ammunition 
the report published in the philippine daily inquirer last 
week drew little response until defense secretary fidel v ramos 
said in a television interview thursday that the military had 
evidence the journalists were from a european television network 
later the military identified the crew as from the british 
broadcasting corp the bbc in london denied the allegation and said 
it had no crew in the country at the time of the ambush 
it appeared the charge may have been raised to frighten foreign 
reporters from contacts with the rebels and from visiting their 
camps 
the military has offered no evidence beyond the womans 
allegation but opposition sen juan ponce enrile a former defense 
minister claimed the military had extensive files proving that 
foreign reporters often paid rebels to stage attacks in exchange 
for scoops 
these foreign journalists go to the enemies of the government 
and ask them to ambush soldiers so they can show to the world that 
the country is in a state of turmoil enrile claimed 
sen ernesto herrera called for curbs on the foreign press if 
the former rebels allegation was true 
the immigration chief today said foreign journalists who pay 
communist rebels to stage ambushes against government forces can be 
deported 
if there is sufficent evidence against the aliens and the 
reports can be verified then that would constitute a deportable 
offense under the immigration act immigration commissioner 
miriam defensorsantiago told reporters 
mrs aquinos spokesman teodoro benigno a former bureau chief 
of the french news agency agence francepresse said the government 
would look into the allegation about the bbc 
but when pressed for comment benigno told filipino reporters 
you are journalists yourselves do you believe that thing really 
happened 
the foreign correspondents association of the philippines has 
so far issued no statement on the charge only the latest in a 
series of allegations against the international media

painted a distorted picture of manila as a crimeridden city by

people remain hospitalized most in critical or serious condition 
the former school bus used by the first assembly of god church 
in radcliff did not meet post1977 safety requirements for a caged 
fuel tank said joseph nall a national transportation safety board 
investigator 
the tank had a 3inch gash and was pushed back 26 inches by the 
crashs impact nall said monday night 
asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire nall said 
thats the ultimate question wed like to answer but now it 
would be premature 
the 1977 superior bus with a ford chassis which the 
manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and a driver 
the number aboard the night of the crash did not appear to be 
overloaded according to nall 
some survivors said the seats that were supposed to hold three 
people were too small resulting in some people hanging in the 
aisle 
there were too many people on that bus said conrad garcia

miles northeast of louisville and noted some braking by both 
drivers before the accident nall said 
only two survivors were interviewed as of monday night but more 
interviews of witnesses were planned nall said 
federal investigators attempted to interview mahoney on monday 
but he would not talk to investigators for reasons of his own 
nall said 
mahoney who was served with warrants in his hospital room will 
be arraigned once he is released district judge stanley 
billingsley denied bond

former gov evan mechams criminal trial 
on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan must begin 
thursday as scheduled an appellate court has ruled 
the intermediate level court of appeals in a 30 decision 
monday rejected a defense bid to have the charges against mecham 
and his brother willard dismissed or returned to the state grand 
jury 
to be honest with you i expected it just the way it came 
out said mecham who sat in the front row during oral arguments 
his lawyer michael scott said he will appeal to the state 
supreme court but probably not before jury selection begins in 
maricopa county superior court 
evan and willard mecham his 1986 campaign treasurer were 
indicted by the grand jury jan 8 on charges of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents 
they were accused of failing to report the 350000 loan on 
either mechams personal or campaign finance reports as required 
mecham faces six counts and his brother faces three 
the court of appeals ruled that the defendants were not denied 
any substantial procedural rights in the grand jury proceedings 
mecham said he does not expect the state supreme court to reverse 
the decision 
i dont know of any possibility or probability of a 
lastminute plea agreement mecham said i have broken no laws 
that i am aware of 
mecham 64 was removed from office april 4 when the senate 
convicted him on impeachment charges of trying to thwart a death 
threat investigation and misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
he also was impeached on charges of concealing the 350000 
campaign loan from tempe developer barry wolfson but the senate 
decided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicing 
mechams criminal trial 
the mechams attorneys asked the appeals court to either dismiss 
the charges or return them to the grand jury for a new 
determination of probable cause 
the 24th grand jury was wellgreased and the indictment was an 
inevitability scott told the court they were given erroneous 
advice the prosecutor manipulated that grand jury 
scott contended the grand jurors were discouraged from calling 
witnesses or from reading transcripts of testimony on the mecham 
case given to a previous grand jury also he said it was unfair to 
exclude from the grand jury everyone who had signed a pro or 
antimecham recall petition 
willard mechams attorney joe keilp accused the state attorney 
generals office of taking an inexperienced grand jury and 
molding them to the will of the prosecutors they jurors were 
discouraged from reading the testimony they were discouraged in 
our view from calling witnesses 
however william schafer iii of the attorney generals criminal 
division contended there was no misconduct and that the grand jury 
was not misled on its power to call witnesses or review testimony 
there was every effort made to ensure that this was going 
to be a fair and impartial grand jury schafer said 
in announcing the courts decision judge melvyn shelley said 
other claims made by the defense in an effort to void the charges 
may be addressed only as an appeal if mecham is convicted 
mecham has insisted that the 350000 loan was properly reported 
when it was lumped with other funds into a 465000 amount listed 
as a contribution from himself 
the thengovernor amended his financial reports on nov 16 to 
include the loan saying the failure to report it earlier was an 
honest mistake by his brother and that there was no intent to 
break the law

ptl said it has issued a final plea for 
supporters to save the ministry from liquidation under a bankruptcy 
plan its fallen founder jim bakker called a literal giveaway 
ptl in a revised reorganization plan filed monday outlined 
plans to sell heritage usa in fort mill and then lease the property 
required to carry on its church and network television ministries 
because of past scandals and credibility problems ptl and 
other television ministries are facing extinction said the 
document signed by ptl trustee david clark 
although the plan filed in us bankruptcy court in columbia 
provides for the sale of all ptl assets to pay creditors it leaves 
an opening for ptl supporters to save the ministry by 
increasing contributions to forestall a complete liquidation 
if the ministry does not receive such support it is possible 
that it will be lost forever the plan said 
bakker who founded ptl in 1974 developed the christian retreat 
and cable television network and then lost it in march 1987 after a 
sex scandal reacted with disdain to the developments 
i am deeply saddened that ptl trustee former cbn executive 
david clark would attempt a literal giveaway of ptl and heritage 
usa to a secular organization bakker said monday in a recorded 
message on the answering machine at his palm springs calif home 
several potential buyers have expressed interest in the retreat 
one is george shinn a sports entrepreneur from charlotte nc 
who wants to build a minor league baseball stadium and a training 
center for his fledgling national basketball association team 
ptl located about 10 miles south of charlotte has an estimated 
130 million in assets some of which is contested ptl has been 
under protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code for 
11 months 
on april 21 the internal revenue service revoked its taxexempt 
status because of an audit that concluded bakker and his aides 
profited excessively from donations to the ministry and because 
much of ptls operations are commercial rather than ministerial 
also last month clark told us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
that ptl would not be able to pay the 57 million initial 
installment on its debt by may 2 as required in the original 
bankruptcy plan filed in december 
reynolds then ordered ptl to come up with a liquidation plan to 
pay creditors 
in the revised plan ptl blamed unspecified scandals and 
unforeseen attacks on television ministries for the inability to 
raise enough money to pay its debts 
due to various scandals and concerns over the use of 
contributions donations dropped drastically the document said 
under the revised plan reynolds would appoint a board of three 
businessmen to preside over ptl as a selfliquidating trust said 
david west ptl director of public relations 
the amended plan establishes a priority for the sale of 160 
million in assets in a 60month period and will authorize leasing 
of ministry assets to a separate nonprofit corporation called 
heritage ministries inc west said 
the priorities for sale in order are the 1700 acres of 
undeveloped property the heritage grand hotel and tower the water 
park a campground an apartment complex a prayer center a 
victorianstyle home an amphitheater the tv network and heritage 
village church 
we would only liquidate what is required to meet the debt 
west said 
whatever money or property was left after debts were paid would 
go back to heritage ministries which would lease the church the 
amphitheater a prayer center and equipment required to run the 
television network west said 
the next major step for ptl will come june 16 when reynolds 
hears objections to the amended plan

a ton of fish heads was dumped here by 
fishermen to protest the unloading of oakland estuary mud in the 
ocean off the san mateo county coast 
theyre dumping on us so we figured it wouldnt hurt to dump 
on them said don pemberton owner of pembertons fish co near 
half moon bay 
the fish heads were dumped at a port of oakland marine terminal 
on monday the day a san mateo county judge halted a dredging 
project the fishermen say will destroy rich fishing grounds 
workers spent several hours cleaning up a 4foothigh 
pyramid of fish heads 
pemberton said he and another fisherman marcellino costilino 
39 loaded the 2000 pounds of fish on his flat bed truck near half 
moon bay 
the superior court restraining order was in response to a 
lawsuit filed friday by san mateo county against the port and the 
california coastal commission county officials alleged the 
commission should have reviewed the dump site 12 miles west of half 
moon bay to make sure it conformed with the states coastal use 
plan 
the judges order blocks dumping until the case can be argued at 
a hearing may 27 
we have been given a chance to live fishermen steve fitz 
said of the judges order 
fitz is the coowner of the boat ronny one of 18 trawlers that 
attempted without success to block the first barge full of material 
from being dumped last friday 
port of oakland officials want to deepen the estuary to make way 
for huge container ships by eventually hauling away 500000 cubic 
yards of sediment 
what youre talking about is the whole viability of the port 
of oakland said port executive director walter a abernathy 
we are surrounded by competing ports in southern california and 
the pacific northwest that have deeper channels and can accommodate 
these larger new ships

a new test reveals if people are infected by 
the aids virus before they develop antibodies and may reduce the 
spread of the disease by sexual contact and tainted blood 
transfusions a scientist says 
the test which could be on the market within two years may 
allow more expeditious detection of the virus in a person and 
therefore that person could be counseled in the danger of spreading 
the virus through sexual contact said molecular geneticist john 
j rossi 
if the test gains widespread use in blood banks it could 
abolish the possibility of tainted blood being given to 
recipients said rossi who works at the city of hope national 
medical center which announced development of the test monday 
by directly detecting how much genetic information from the aids 
virus is present in a persons blood or body tissues the test also 
should help scientists study the effectiveness of experimental 
drugs in attacking the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome rossi said 
the test is similar but more sensitive and accurate than one 
developed by scientists at cetus corp of emeryville and the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta said rossi who 
led a team that developed the new test 
using a process patented by cetus which announced its test in 
january in the journal science both tests amplify or increase by 
a billionfold the amount of genetic information from aids virus in 
a blood or tissue sample 
that allows the presence of 100 molecules of aids virus to be 
detected in an infected person even if that person hasnt 
developed antibodies against the virus the existing test called 
elisa detects those antibodies which often dont develop until 
months after a person has been infected 
some infected people who havent developed antibodies arent 
identified by the existing test allowing them to unknowingly 
transmit the virus during sex or by donating their tainted blood 
cdc researchers say that means about one in 40000 tested blood 
transfusions contains aids virus 
rossi said the new tests can detect the presence of the virus 
within a few days after infection 
the cetus test amplifies and detects deoxyribonucleic acid or 
dna from the aids virus dna is the hereditary blueprint that 
orders construction of proteins in all cells rossi said his is 
more sensitive because it amplifies and detects the aids virus 
more plentiful ribonucleic acid rna transcribes the inherited 
information from dna to help make proteins 
rossi said the test also contains builtin controls lacking in 
the cetus test to make it 999 percent accurate in determining if 
a person is or isnt infected 
rossi said the cost of the new tests would be comparable to the 
existing one but any company that manufactures and sells such 
tests may have to pay royalties to cetus 
the new test eventually should replace the existing one once its 
accuracy is established rossi said 
rossi said scientists are trying to apply the amplification 
method used in the cetus and city of hope aids tests for use in 
detecting herpes simplex viruses a form of leukemia and 
cytomegalovirus a major killer of aids patients and cause of birth 
defects 
development of the new test was reported in this months issue 
of the journal dna by rossi his city of hope colleagues and george 
murakawa rossis student at the university of california los 
angeles

syria and iran agreed today to renew 
diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting between shiite moslem 
factions in beiruts southern slums where western hostages are 
believed to be held 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and the 
prosyrian amal militia continued to battle with mortars and 
machine guns during the night defying a new ceasefire called by 
iran and syria 
police said 12 people were killed and 40 wounded since the 
latest truce was called at 11 pm 5 pm edt on monday it was 
the seventh ceasefire called since fighting broke out may 6 in the 
16squaremile enclave 
the latest clash brought the casualty toll to 237 killed and 746 
wounded 
in other developments unconfirmed reports said the iranians and 
syrians were working on a deal under which the syrian army would 
not try to free the hostages if its soldiers moved into the area 
the united states indicated it would be willing to talk with the 
captors of the hostages in the slums 
shell blasts and gunfire echoed across beirut today police said 
amal which has lost most of the territory it held in the region 
mounted a counterattack to regain the sprawling shiyah district 
amal is pushing hard and hezbollah is retreating in shiyah for 
a second day said a police spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules but the fundamentalists remain in control of 90 
percent of the slums only the syrians can crush them 
the syrians massed thousands of troops around the embattled 
enclave in the last two days poising for a push to stop the 
fighting 
were ready to go in but zero hour has not been set yet 
said a syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport 
facing hezbollahs strongholds 
the agreement to revive political efforts to end the battle was 
reached in meetings held by irans acting foreign minister ali 
mohammed besharati government leaders and army officers in 
damascus and beirut on monday 
the door is still open for political efforts syrias 
military intelligence chief in lebanon brig gen ghazi kenaan 
said after a onehour meeting with besharati 
but kenaan stopped short of saying whether syria would rescind 
its decision to send troops into the slums with shoottokill 
orders to separate and disarm the combatants 
that decision has been taken after all peaceful methods were 
exhausted kenaan told reporters but if there is a new hope to 
stop the bloodbath with political efforts well give it a try 
besharati told reporters the talks with kenaan were 
positive he did not elaborate beyond saying i came to 
bandage the bleeding wounds of the suburbs 
christiancontrolled radio stations said besharatis talks were 
focusing on a threepoint deal 
a pledge that the syrians would not seek to free the 18 foreign 
hostages believed held by hezbollahaffilated extremists in the 
slums nine americans are believed to be among the hostages 
safety and freedom for an estimated 500 iranian revolutionary 
guards fighting alongside hezbollah before the syrians move in 
hezbollah as well as amal would lay down arms provided they be 
allowed to function as unarmed political parties 
the report could not be independently verified besharati and 
the iranian embassy refused to comment christian radio stations 
have rarely been accurate on moslem affairs 
sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin head of the supreme shiite 
council the sects highest religious body reiterated today that 
syrian forces should move in every other method is just a waste 
of time he said in a statement broadcast by beirut radio stations 
the united states indicated on monday it would be willing to 
talk with the captors of the hostages believed held in the slums 
state department spokesman charles redman asked about reports 
that the hostages had been moved from the slums said i dont 
have anything to say about their whereabouts 
he said washington was pleased by a call from the spiritual 
guide of hezbollah sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah for talks 
about the hostages

i made it through vietnam and i almost got killed in my own 
hometown said corrections officer ron scott who was released as 
the insurrection ended monday morning im just glad im alive 
im going to try to live one day at a time

dormitory burned down during the riot 
state lawmakers who said the inmates should live with the 
problem they created vowed to take their time in rebuilding nine 
inmates believed to be directly involved in the hostagetaking were 
moved to the lexington assessment and reception center in lexington

voters in suburban denver will decide today whether the city can 
build a new airport to replace crowded stapleton international in 
portland ore mayor bud clark was favored in his bid for a second 
term while voters statewide considered a mandatory motorcycle 
helmet law 
backers have outspent opponents heavily in the campaign for a 3 
billion replacement for stapleton 
officials say that if adams county voters approve the ballot 
question whether to allow denver to annex an unincorporated 
45squaremile site in their county it will virtually ensure that 
the airport can be built 
in portland clark the citys colorful barkeeperturnedmayor 
has weathered the storms of his first term so well that he is given 
a chance of winning a second term outright in the nonpartisan 
election and avoiding a november runoff he has 10 challengers on 
the ballot 
his campaign focused on getting more than 50 percent today a 
poll published sunday gave him 51 percent with a 49 point margin 
of error 
clark shocked the city four years ago when he stepped out of his 
popular goose hollow inn and mounted a grassroots campaign to 
unseat incumbent frank ivancie 
in his first two years in office however clark faced a series 
of crises mostly involving the city police bureau two police 
chiefs resigned and clark fired a third 
oregonians also voted on a proposal for a mandatory motorcycle 
helmet law for adults the current law applies only to those under 
age 18 
the measure would require drivers and passengers of motorcycles 
and mopeds to wear protective headgear or face a 100 fine 
oregon congressional primaries are also being held four of the 
five incumbents face no primary opposition the fifth democratic 
rep ron wyden faces only a nominal challenge 
the airport at denver is the first major one planned in the 
united states since dallasfort worth opened in 1974 
opponents contend jet noise generated by the airport would be 
unbearable for homeowners and say closing stapleton would waste 
money proponents including gov roy romer point to a study that 
predicts a new airport would generate 54000 jobs by 2010

nearly 400 inmates who had to use buckets as 
toilets in cells at the county jail in lawrence will split 12 
million in a settlement of their class action suit 
inmates originally sued in 1981 claiming the lack of plumbing 
violated their rights 
two years later superior court judge paul g garrity ruled that 
the conditions which he said were disgusting and shocking needed 
to be remedied he gave essex county six months to replace lidded 
pots with toilets and sinks 
essex county sheriff charles reardon said monday the 12 milion 
will be divided among 397 inmates forced to use plastic night 
soil pots in their cells after the 9 pm lockdown between 1981 
and june 1 1984 when toilets and hot and cold water were 
installed 
the 153yearold jail has 126 cells 
the state department of correction will pay half the settlement 
this year and essex county will pay the rest in three installments 
during the next three years 
reardon said he is concerned the settlement may set precedent 
for similar lawsuits including one against the countys 
170yearold jail in salem that has no toilets in cells 
he said the setlement was sensible in that the lawrence inmates 
had sought 25 million 
but on the opposite side of the coin its a tough pill to 
swallow to have to give this money to people who have gone to jail 
for violating the rights of other people he said

soviet and american aircraft will make a series of 
flights through a large hole in the earths protective ozone layer 
next year so scientists can study whether there are harmful changes 
in the worlds climate 
the two nations announced monday that they have agreed to 
coordinate the experimental flights over the arctic in january and 
february 
sg tilford director of nasas earth science and application 
division told reporters the soviets and americans probably will 
use separate aircraft for the experiment but the two groups of 
scientists and pilots will share information and coordinate flight 
schedules 
the mission was announced at a moscow news conference by 
american scientists from the national aeronautics and space 
administration and soviet representatives from this countrys 
academy of sciences 
tilford said he hopes 10 to 20 flights can be made through the 
ozone layer to collect data 
tilford said the aircraft have an altitude limit of 12 miles 
but scientists estimate that the hole in the ozone layer extends to 
31 miles 
he said the us scientists and pilots hope to be based 
somewhere in norway it was undecided where the soviets will be 
based he said but well be in close touch coordinating 
schedules and flights 
ozone in the atmosphere filters out the suns ultraviolent rays 
making life on earth possible 
a nasa report in march said the ozone layer over the united 
states has shrunk by about 23 percent since 1969 the report put 
the blame on chlorofluorocarbons chemicals used to power some 
aerosol sprays 
they were banned as aerosol propellants in the united states in 
1978 but they continue to be used to clean computer chips and 
other electronic parts as refrigeration fluids and for making 
plastic foams 
the environmental protection agency has estimated that a 1 
percent thinning of the earths ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6 
percent increase in skin cancer if chlorofluorocarbon use 
continued increasing at 25 percent per year epa said 20 percent 
of the ozone barrier could be gone in the next century 
the soviet union has several chlorofluorocarbon plants under 
construction and has won several temporary exemptions to a 
31nation treaty cutting emissions that damage the ozone layer 
academy of sciences spokesman k kondratyev said scientists 
differ on the effects of ozone depletion but generally believe it 
causes an increase in the earths temperature leading to 
deforestation in tropical areas reduction in atmospheric moisture 
and eventually deterioration of the earths soil

defense minister magnus malan 
said that reported cuban troop deployment in southern angola is a 
threat to further negotiations on regional peace 
angolas marxist government is supported by an estimated 40000 
cuban troops in its 13year fight against unita the national 
union for the total independence of angola south africa and the 
united states back unita 
in remarks before parliament on monday malan cautioned against 
a quick solution to the angolan conflict 
i am not optimistic that negotiations will be easy or that 
they will succeed soon malan said 
malan was part of the south african delegation that met with 
angolan officials in brazzaville congo friday to discuss ways of 
ending angolas civil war 
he said that up to 9000 cuban troops recently have been 
deployed in southern angola near the border of southwest africa 
the territory administered by south africa 
the cubans are exceeding their mandate in angola malan 
said they were not brought there invited or sent there to form 
a shield for swapo the guerrilla group seeking independence in 
southwest africa 
swapo or southwest african peoples organization has bases in 
southern angola from which it launches attacks into southwest 
africa also known as namibia south africa says it will not grant 
namibia independence until cuban troops leave angola 
malan said if the cuban troops assist swapo this could be the 
spark that starts the fire 
south africa and angola have said they plan to arrange a new 
round of talks shortly however malan and other leading south 
african officials repeatedly have stated that no major 
breakthroughs appear imminent 
in portugal a us embassy official said on monday that top 
us and soviet negotiators on southern africa will meet in lisbon 
this week to discuss the civil war in angola and south africas 
control of namibia 
chester crocker the us assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs and anatoly adamishin a soviet deputy foreign 
minister will open the talks wednesday embassy spokeswoman susan 
clyde said she said only soviet and us officials are expected to 
take part in the talks 
crocker and adamishin have met several times recently to discuss 
ways of ending the conflicts in southern africa 
also monday angolan president jose eduardo dos santos said 
angola accepted the principle of a gradual withdrawal of the cuban 
military personnel from his country 
in an interview with the official angolan news agency angop dos 
santos said the united states is refusing to recognize angola 
diplomatically until the cubans have left he said that position 
was absurd and without any logical explanation 
the angop report monitored in lisbon quoted dos santos as 
saying namibian independence and the end of the angolan war would 
be decisive steps toward peace in southern africa and the abolition 
of racial segregation in south africa

the brakes of a cable car that careened out 
of control down one of the citys steepest streets were not 
defective officials said leaving them puzzled about the cause of 
the accident that injured 31 people 
everything worked the way it was supposed to said george 
newkirk spokesman for the san francisco municipal railway 
operators of the historic openair cablepulled trolleys 
the cable car was jammed with tourists monday morning when 
witnesses said it barreled down rainslick tracks on hyde street a 
hill with a 21degree angle and slammed into the rear of a large 
repair truck 
if the truck had not been there in the intersection we would 
not have had the accident the truck was on the tracks the cable 
car was going 9 mph there just wasnt time to stop it newkirk 
said 
one man whose name was not available was pinned under the 
wheels of car no 13 and other victims were strewn across the 
intersection at hyde and bay streets just above fishermans wharf 
the front of the car was ripped off and the rear of the truck 
was crushed 
police and witnesses said the truck was stopped for a red light 
when hit by the sixton cable car which normally travels at 9 mph 
by the time we got to the bottom of the hill we were going 30 
or 40 miles per hour when we hit said tourist jed porter of 
kansas city mo who was wrapped in a blanket after the crash 
i was sitting inside when the brakeman said hold on hold 
on i held on then we hit we were going very fast down the 
hill said esther breckenridge st charles mo who was 
favoring a bruised leg 
gripman gerald bolden has been with muni since 1981 and has a 
clean record newkirk said 
however oakland television station ktvu reported monday night 
that bolden had been a cable car gripman for just two weeks after 
receiving a month of training for the position 
twentynine people were taken to 10 hospitals and two people 
were treated at the scene injuries ranged from cuts and bruises to 
fractures five people were admitted to hospitals with fractures 
but no one was seriously injured said san francisco general 
hospital spokeswoman gloria rodriguez 
a spokeswoman for kingston contracting co located in 
burlingame 30 miles south of san francisco said the company would 
not comment on the accident which involved one of its socalled 
cherrypickers 
the truck driver whose hand was injured declined to give his 
name or to talk at the scene except to say i dont feel good i 
was told not to say anything 
newkirk disputed accounts by witnesses who said the cars 
braking system appeared not to work and that the car accelerated 
before plowing into the truck 
it may have appeared that way to people on the car but from 
the evidence on the scene the track brake was working he said 
investigators are trying to determine whether the brake was 
applied too late to stop the crash he said 
we are trying to determine at what point it was applied it 
may have been just before the impact with the truck newkirk said 
rainslicked tracks also could have caused the car to slide 
rather than to stop abruptly he said 
the same intersection was the scene of the worst accident in 
cable car history when an outofcontrol cable car slammed into 
several cars killing two people and injuring 43 on dec 3 1967 
each cable car has four separate braking systems as a last 
resort the gripman can pull a red hotline lever which rams 
an 18inchlong steel blade into the cable slot that brake was 
activated in the latest case and although it failed to halt the 
car it welded itself to the steel slot and had to be cut out with 
a torch

a time magazine article about a company once 
coowned by labor secretary ray donovan was unfair and slanted a 
federal appeals court said as it reinstated a libel suit filed by 
the company 
but the us 3rd circuit court of appeals on monday also 
classifed the company and its chairman as public figures meaning 
they must meet the difficult test of proving time showed actual 
malice before collecting damages 
the suit filed by schiavone construction co of secaucus nj 
and chairman ronald schiavone centers on an aug 23 1982 article 
about a special federal prosecutor reopening an investigation into 
donovans activities while he was labor secretary 
the magazine cited a memo from william webster then fbi 
director saying the name schiavone appeared several times in the 
agencys reports on the 1975 disappearance of former teamster boss 
jimmy hoffa 
the company charged that the article unfairly failed to mention 
that the memo also said the reports linked the company and director 
to no criminal acts 
in november 1986 us district judge h lee sarokin threw out 
the suit saying the reputations of schiavone and his company were 
so poor they were libel proof and could not be damaged further 
by the article 
the appeals court noted schiavones lawyers argued the sting 
of the article did not rest with references to mafia connections 
but in references to schiavone and the hoffa disappearance 
if the jury were to find the sting to be the association with 
hoffas disappearance then it might find that schiavone and scc 
had suffered actual or presumed damages the court said 
the court also affirmed an earlier ruling by sarokin that time 
was not immune to the libel suit under new jerseys fair report 
privilege under the law reporters are shielded from libel suits 
while quoting official reports even if the reports later prove 
inaccurate 
the appellate court ruled that time forfeited the privilege 
because the reporter intentionally left out a portion of the fbi 
memo 
we believe that times omission presents a clear example of an 
unfair report that does not deserve the qualified privilege to 
reproduce a libel circuit judge edward r becker wrote for the 
threejudge panel 
the last paragraph in times article combines selective 
quoting and innuendo to provide a very different message than the 
article would have conveyed had it included the exculpatory 
material becker wrote 
the time story questioned why the fbi during its routine 
investigation of donovan before his senate confirmation withheld 
information from a special prosecutor

syria and iran agreed today to renew 
diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting between shiite moslem 
factions in beiruts southern slums where western hostages are 
believed to be held 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and the 
prosyrian amal militia continued to battle with mortars and 
machine guns during the night defying a new ceasefire called by 
iran and syria 
police said 12 people were killed and 40 wounded since the 
latest truce was called at 11 pm 5 pm edt on monday it was 
the seventh ceasefire called since fighting broke out may 6 in the 
16squaremile enclave 
the latest clash brought the casualty toll to 237 killed and 746 
wounded 
in other developments unconfirmed reports said the iranians and 
syrians were working on a deal under which the syrian army would 
not try to free the hostages if its soldiers moved into the area 
the united states indicated it would be willing to talk with the 
captors of the hostages in the slums 
shell blasts and gunfire echoed across beirut today police said 
amal which has lost most of the territory it held in the region 
mounted a counterattack to regain the sprawling shiyah district 
amal is pushing hard and hezbollah is retreating in shiyah for 
a second day said a police spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules but the fundamentalists remain in control of 90 
percent of the slums only the syrians can crush them 
the syrians massed thousands of troops around the embattled 
enclave in the last two days poising for a push to stop the 
fighting 
were ready to go in but zero hour has not been set yet 
said a syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport 
facing hezbollahs strongholds 
the agreement to revive political efforts to end the battle was 
reached in meetings held monday and today by irans acting foreign 
minister ali mohammed besharati government leaders and army 
officers in damascus and beirut 
the door is still open for political efforts syrias 
military intelligence chief in lebanon brig gen ghazi kenaan 
said after a onehour meeting with besharati 
but kenaan stopped short of saying whether syria would rescind 
its decision to send troops into the slums with shoottokill 
orders to separate and disarm the combatants 
that decision has been taken after all peaceful methods were 
exhausted kenaan told reporters but if there is a new hope to 
stop the bloodbath with political efforts well give it a try 
besharati told reporters the talks with kenaan were 
positive he did not elaborate beyond saying i came to 
bandage the bleeding wounds of the suburbs 
christiancontrolled radio stations said besharatis talks were 
focusing on a threepoint deal 
a pledge that the syrians would not seek to free the 18 foreign 
hostages believed held by hezbollahaffilated extremists in the 
slums nine americans are believed to be among the hostages 
safety and freedom for an estimated 500 iranian revolutionary 
guards fighting alongside hezbollah before the syrians move in 
hezbollah as well as amal would lay down arms provided they be 
allowed to function as unarmed political parties 
the report could not be independently verified besharati and 
the iranian embassy refused to comment christian radio stations 
have rarely been accurate on moslem affairs 
sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin head of the supreme shiite 
council the sects highest religious body reiterated today that 
syrian forces should move in every other method is just a waste 
of time he said in a statement broadcast by beirut radio stations 
the united states indicated on monday it would be willing to 
talk with the captors of the hostages believed held in the slums 
state department spokesman charles redman asked about reports 
that the hostages had been moved from the slums said i dont 
have anything to say about their whereabouts

per month 
the sowetan said a female protester was arrested and a man was 
hospitalized after he was bitten by a police dog 
weilers farm is designated as an temporary squatter camp 
whites in the area 25 miles south of johannesburg have complained 
about the settlement and its estimated 7000 residents are 
scheduled to be moved later this year

leaders say a lower rent might be acceptable but the transvaal 
province administration contends that it must charge the 17 
monthly to cover the cost of services

injured when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at strikers 
trying to stop delivery trucks from leaving a coca cola bottling 
plant in durban union officials said police reported six injuries 
and said strikers had thrown chairs at the trucks

protest alleged unfair labor practices the stoppage began in 
durban two weeks ago no other details were available 
in another incident police said three black men were stabbed to 
death by black youths on monday in natal province 
this followed five killings in the area sunday and indicated a 
possible escalation of feuding between militant antiapartheid 
factions and the more moderate inkatha the natalbased political 
organization of zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi buthelezi 
although critical of apartheid is considered too conservative by 
many activists 
more than 500 people have died in the natal conflict in the past 
18 months among those killed on sunday was the son of abdul 
awetha a prominent inkatha leader who is accused in court papers

resign saying he is an embarrassment to the country

meese fired the departments chief spokesman terry eastland for 
allegedly not defending the attorney general aggressively enough 
the firing prompted the head of meeses speechwriting unit 
william schambra to quit 
it just appears that ed meese wants to fire anybody who 
disagrees with him or if he doesnt fire them they seem to be 
resigning on their own metzenbaum said on cbss this morning 
show 
i think its time for ed meese to clean house and start at the 
top and its time for ed meese to resign i think hes an 
embarrassment to the administration frankly i think hes an 
embarrassment to the country the senator said 
metzenbaum noting an editorial in the politicallyconservative 
washington times today that urges the attorney general to resign 
said i think the conservative backers across the board are 
walking away from ed meese

i think they recognize that the sooner he gets off the ship the 
better it will be for the reagan administration he said 
metzenbaum intially called for meeses resignation in late march 
after deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal division 
chief william weld quit out of concern that meeses continued

firing live ammunition in an arab village where a teenager was 
killed troops shot and seriously wounded a palestinian who tried 
to wrest a gun from a soldier 
an army spokesman said the shooting today occurred in the 
kalandia refugee camp north of jerusalem after soldiers tried to 
stop an arab man from violating a curfew 
the man got out of his car and tried to take a gun from one of 
the soldiers and the troops opened fire wounding the palestinian 
in the abdomen the army said 
a doctor at ramallah hospital identified the man as ali asnan 
youssef 31 and said he also had bruises on the abdomen indicating 
he was beaten before the shooting 
kalandia was one of four refugee camps and towns under curfew in 
the occupied territories on the second day of the threeday holiday 
that ends ramadan the moslem holy month of fasting 
underground leaders of a fivemonthold uprising have urged 
palestinians to make the holiday one of national mourning for 
the 190 arabs killed in the rebellion 
in clashes monday troops killed two palestinians in gaza and 
the village of azmut in the west bank and 13 people were wounded 
the army said an officer was severely scolded and another 
soldier given a suspended jail sentence of 35 days for the shooting 
incident in azmut 
officers were still investigating whether the 15yearold 
teenager reported killed in the confrontation was shot by soldiers 
an army spokesman said the soldier involved who was not 
identified by name fired against regulations and his officer did 
not stop him 
the army meanwhile lifted a fourday curfew from the west 
banks largest city of nablus and from the shati refugee camp in 
gaza but later declared the camp a closed military area barring 
residents from leaving and reporters from entering

days the detention of an arab woman from the village of beita who 
could be tried for murder or attempted murder for the death of a 
jewish teenage girl there last month

porat died of a bullet fired from the guards weapon

the government would not be able to absorb for long sums of 
hundreds of millions of shekels without this badly damaging the 
readiness of those two forces 
yaacobi gave no figure for the cost but israeli news reports 
have put it at 800 million shekels or about 530 million 
us folk singer joan baez on monday accused israel army radio 
of censoring her because she insisted on singing a protest song the 
station had banned 
the station canceled a live broadcast of a performance by ms 
baez after she announced she would sing the song entitled 
shooting and crying 
the song written by singer si himan two months after the arab

flour sugar and other staples are 
in short supply in the yugoslav capital because residents are 
stocking up in anticipation of huge price increases later this 
month newspapers reported today 
coffee disappeared first from belgrade shops city authorities 
said they would dip into emergency reserves to supply 250 tons of 
coffee to consumers the vecernje novosti daily reported 
local media reported about 80 percent of the countrys 
manufacturers have announced they will boost prices when the 
government lifts a price freeze later this month new prices are 
expected to be about 50 to 70 percent higher than the current ones 
the government has announced a 3 percent increase in the price 
of coffee effective immediately one kilogram of coffee now costs 
13 
belgrade authorities said the sale of detergents jumped by 100 
percent cooking oil by 70 percent flour by 50 percent and sugar 
by 45 percent compared to the week before 
shelves storing these items are virtually empty said 
vecernje novosti 
city officials called on yugoslavs not to stockpile goods 
saying the practice could create even worse shortages 
the price freeze was to end may 15 but was postponed until 
later this month after the government announced it had failed to 
secure about 300 million in emergency credits from the west 
the government said the funds were a condition for yugoslavia to 
receive an expected 14 billion in new loans from the 
international monetary fund western governments and banks to 
finance the countrys 20 billion foreign debt 
failure to secure the initial funds led the government to delay 
the lifting of the wage and price freeze until an agreement on the 
loans is reached 
the lifting of the sixmonth price freeze will also coincide 
with a package of economic measures intended to reduce yugoslavias 
170 percent inflation rate europes highest and help the country 
repay its foreign debt 
the economic package includes ceilings on wage increases 
measures against the further decline of yugoslavias currency the 
dinar the lifting of import barriers and the gradual closing down 
of industries which show losses 
the austerity program is likely to contribute to a further drop 
in yugoslavias living standards which have already fallen by 
onethird since 1980 labor unrest which in 1987 produced over 
1500 strikes is also expected to grow

police charged three trading company executives 
today with exporting hightechnology equipment to china in 
violation of rules governing the sale of western technology to 
communist nations 
the metropolitan police department said it arrested yoshikazu 
ono 44 and teruko takeuchi 43 of the kyokuto shokai company 
and yasuhiko kusabe 51 of shinsei koeki 
police said kyokuto shokai and shinsei koeki exported electronic 
equipment to china between june 1985 and november 1986 without 
government permission 
ono was in charge of all exports by kyokuto shokai while 
takeuchi was in charge of the companys exports to china kusabe 
was in charge of exports by shinsei koeki 
the three were charged with violating two japanese laws the 
foreign exchange and trade control law and the customs law 
exporting such equipment to communist nations is banned by the 
coordinating committee for multilateral export controls a 
parisbased watchdog body on trade with commuist bloc nations 
police also filed charges under the same laws against the two 
companies and iwatsu electric co which manufactured the exported 
products police said iwatsu is suspected of supplying digital 
equipment to kyokuto with the knowledge that it would be exported 
to china 
the united states demanded japan enforce its export controls 
after the toshiba machine co a subsidiary of the electronics 
giant toshiba corp was charged last year with illegally exporting 
sophisticated technology to the soviet union 
police raided the three companies charged today on april 5 in 
response to a ministry of international trade and industry request 
a ministry official said it had investigated the case independently 
based on tips given by a us government official whom it declined 
to identify 
china is coming to be treated differently from the rest of the 
soviet bloc countries in terms of export controls said ichiro 
takahara deputy director of export section of the trade ministry 
but there is no excuse on these cases because it evaded the 
responsibility of applying for ministry permission 
takahara said permission would not have been granted because of 
restrictions on the export of the equipment 
police said kyokuto shokai illegally exported 30 digital memory 
devices signal analyzers and sampling oscilloscopes worth about 
500000 to china between june 9 1985 and june 3 1986

luggage when company employees visited there 
shinsei koeki allegedly exported four sets of digital memory 
devices worth 136000 to china between july 1986 and november 1986 
after its export application was rejected police said 
defense analysts said the products have limited military 
applications 
penalties for the men could vary two toshiba employees were 
sentenced to two years in prison and fined 80000 for the same 
offense

about 90 indian commandos pushed into the 
golden temple complex today to try to dislodge sikh militants from 
two towers overlooking the goldendomed shrine police said 
it was the first major probe into the complex sikhisms holiest 
shrine since a police siege of the shrine began may 9 
the advance came after sikh extremists in an apparent effort to 
divert attention from the besieged temple complex killed 44 people 
monday and early today in the highest 24hour toll in their 
6yearold campaign to form an independent nation in punjab 
punjab police chief kps gill told a news conference tha 
antiterrorist black cat commandos had taken over the upper 
basement of a building which is attached to the temples dining 
hall east of the pool surrounding the temple 
militants have been using the buildings two towers to fire down 
on security forces surrounding the shrines perimeter 
about six sikh extremists were believed trapped in a lower 
basement gill said 
the building is not considered the temples inner sanctum 
any attempt to storm the inner sanctum would be viewed by devout 
sikhs as the gravest desecration 
prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by sikh bodyguards 
on oct 31 1984 four months after she ordered the army into the 
golden temple to uproot armed sikh militants more than 1200 
people mostly sikhs were killed in that assault 
today security forces fired scores of incendiary shells and 
machine gun rounds at the 120foot towers to force the militants to 
retreat to the basements 
small groups of commandos had gone to the rooftop and upper 
stories of the dining hall starting sunday 
meanwhile 18 people were shot to death when militants opened 
fire with ak47 automatic rifles in the market of the village of 
samana in patiala district indian newspapers reported 
at least 18 others were injured in samana 140 miles southeast 
of amritsar near punjabs border with haryana state news reports 
said 
details were not immediately available on the remaining dead 
in the previous highest oneday toll 37 people were killed by 
sikh extremists on april 1 the latest figures raise to at least 
1008 the number of deaths blamed on sikh extremists in punjab this 
year about 1030 deaths were attributed to the militants in all of 
1987 
earlier today the 2800 security troops surrounding the golden 
temple complex called a ceasefire and urged the estimated 40 to 50 
sikh extremists inside the shrine to surrender 
instead the militants used the lull in the security forces 
firing to try to replenish their supplies 
an associated press reporter watching from a nearby rooftop 
saw two sikhs run out of the temple with their hands in the air as 
if to surrender the inner sanctum of the temple is where most of 
the gunmen are believed to have taken refuge in recent days 
the two men darted into a nearby building and then moved several 
sacks to the temples walkway 
police said they believed the sacks contained food and 
ammunition and opened fire to prevent the two men from returning to 
the temple the men retreated to the storage building and it could 
not be determined if they had been hit 
three other sikhs were seen using pails to pull water from the 
pool around the temple during the ceasefire 
chaman lal inspectorgeneral of punjab police made the call 
for surrender he was joined by six people all relatives of those 
still inside the shrine who were among 146 who surrendered to 
police on sunday similar appeals were made during two ceasefires 
monday 
although a majority in punjab sikhs form only 2 percent of 
indias population of 800 million the militants say they are 
discriminated against by the hindus who are 82 percent of the 
population 
eight hundred people most of them pilgrims or temple workers 
were brought out of the temple may 10 
the siege began after sikh gunmen inside the temple opened fire 
on a party of police commanders who had gone to nearby roofs to 
inspect what appeared to be a new bunker outside the temple walls 
at least 35 people mostly sikh militants have died since the 
siege began

pope john paul ii in one of his 
sternest lectures to a head of state told president alfredo 
stroessner that the granting of human rights is not a question of 
political convenience 
in an address monday night to stroessner top government aides 
and foreign diplomats at the presidential palace the pope said 
respect for human rights stems from the dignity of the person 
by virtue of his condition as a creature of god 
stroessner 75 has ruled paraguay since a coup in 1954 
the pope also defended the churchs role in social causes 
saying you cant corner the church in its temples 
today the pope met for an hour with 1000 priests nuns and 
seminarians then left by car for a mass with peasant farmers in 
villarrica a regional agricultural center of 50000 people 100 
miles southeast of the capital 
in his meeting in the national cathedral the pontiff told the 
clergy they must give preference in their ministries to the poor 
who in paraguay as in so many parts of latin america suffer 
every kind of privation 
so many peasants laborers and workers without employment or 
being exploited lack their badly needed bread john paul said 
john paul flew from peru to paraguay the last stop on his 
fournation south american tour and met privately with stroessner 
for 30 minutes before delivering his speech 
stroessner responded by declaring his government was 
democratically elected and saying here we dont suffer the 
scourge of terrorism hunger or drugs he described paraguay as a 
country without social or political crises tumult street 
violence polticial prisoners or hate 
relations between the stroessner government and the vatican were 
strained last week when paraguayan authorities canceled a meeting 
between the pope and a churchsponsored civic group that includes 
opposition figures after talks with the church the government 
lifted the ban but members of stroessners governing colorado 
party were expected to boycott the meeting today 
the pontiff arrived in paraguay on monday afternoon minutes 
later police picked up a roman catholic priest the rev donald 
bahlinger of baton rouge la and three paraguayan labor and 
peasant activitists as they left a downtown church in asuncion the 
capital people had gathered in the church for a fast and prayer 
service protesting stroessners authoritarian rule 
radio caritas asuncions catholicrun station later said 
bahlinger had been released but there was no word on the 
whereabouts of the paraguayans 
in his speech at the presidential palace the pontiff said 
it is the duty and obligation of political power to create and 
make posssible those social conditions that favor the real and 
complete good of the person respecting the legitimate freedom 
of individuals families and intermediate groups 
we live in democracy in paraguay stroessner responded he 
said the last presidential election in february occurred in an 
atmosphere of order and civic maturity without spilling a drop of 
blood 
stroessner was elected to an eighth consecutive term with 886 
percent of the vote opposition leaders claimed the balloting was 
rigged 
stroessner referred to paraguays catholic roots but made no 
direct mention of present churchstate relations his government 
has denounced some catholic priests calling them communists and 
subversives because of their involvement in social and labor issues 
bahlinger is a jesuit priest who has worked with paraguayan 
peasants for eight years at a mission 120 miles south of asuncion 
near the argentine border in an interview at the church shortly 
before he was detained he said the rural poor in this nation of 3 
million are severely repressed 
you can taste the fear in the countryside its diabolical 
he said 
paraguay is the last stop on the 12day papal tour that included 
uruguay bolvia and peru the pope leaves on wednesday his 68th 
birthday for rome

a national communist party conference next month 
will consider limiting the term of the general secretary in what 
would be a major departure from the usual soviet practice of 
lifelong tenure a top official said 
dmitri a lisovolik a deputy to party central committee 
secretary anatoly f dobrynin told a group of american business 
leaders that proposals have been introduced to limit the party 
leader to two or three terms of eight years each 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev raised the idea of 
creating a mechanism to replace aging officials in top party jobs 
at a january 1987 meeting of the central committee but it 
apparently met with opposition then because the meetings final 
documents only made passing reference to it 
the soviet leader has said more freqent turnover would make 
officials more accountable to the people 
many letters have appeared in recent weeks in the soviet press 
proposing fixed terms and age limits for the countrys leaders an 
indication the idea is being brought back under consideration 
lisovolik speaking at a reception monday night to several 
members of the young presidents organization as well as a reporter 
did not mention the proposals for age limits he said he could not 
predict whether the proposals for fixed terms would be adopted but 
indicated support has been growing for this 
the young presidents organization is a group of american and 
some foreign business leaders a delegation of the group arrived in 
moscow on saturday 
lisovolik 50 has been chief of the us section of the 
international department of the central committee since december 
1984 he served briefly in the soviet embassy in washington under 
dobrynin who was ambassador from 1962 to 1986 dobrynin is now 
central committee secretary in charge of foreign affairs 
the washington post today quoted georgi a arbatov another 
member of the central committee as saying in an interview that 
there is a good chance the group will introduce proposals at 
the june 28 party conference limiting the general secretarys term 
arbatov said the changes would not indicate any setback for 
gorbachev who has been general secretary since march 1985 
communist party general secretaries commonly serve life terms 
an exception was nikita s khrushchev who was forced from office 
in 1964

israel set up an emergency unit today to 
prepare for a possible invasion of locusts from africa in what 
would be the first time the biblical plague has struck the country 
in almost 30 years 
shmuel elhanan director of the unit said the agriculture 
ministry fears that unusually high temperatures in the country 
could attract swarms of the yellow desert insects which are 
already devouring crops in parts of africa 
a small number of the insects have been sighted in egypts sinai 
desert just south of israel but officials warned of a possible 
larger invasion from the south 
once this locust has swarmed it flies in groups of millions 
and even billions so that even if each one eats only part of an 
ounce the damage is impossible to estimate just as described in 
the bible said elhanan 
the locust threat came as the worst heat wave to strike israel 
in 18 years entered a fourth day today temperatures reached 113 
degrees monday in the west bank city of jericho 
the heat has caused forest fires that destroyed more than 1350 
acres of trees and pastures an austrian tourist died of heat 
stroke while hiking in the desert over the weekend 
elhanan told israel radio that he had set aside light aircraft 
and jeeps to spray insecticides at the locusts if they arrived 
some crops are destroyed by the flying swarm but most of the 
destruction occurs after the insects lay eggs at night the larvae 
which hatch in 15 to 20 days devour all green vegetation 
emergency telephone hotlines have been set up so that anyone who 
spotted locusts could inform the government 
israels last invasion of locusts in 1959 destroyed thousands of 
crops before they were harvested 
according to the old testament a locust invasion was one of 10 
plagues visited upon the ancient egytians by the god of the 
israelites 
they covered all the ground until it was black they devoured 
all that was left after the hail nothing green remained on tree 
or plant in all the land of egyptexodus 1015

house and senate negotiators unanimously 
approved a compromise bill today that would ban most lie detector 
tests for private employees and job applicants clearing the way 
for swift final passage by congress 
sen orrin hatch of utah ranking republican on the labor and 
human resources committee said he would urge president reagan to 
sign the bill which he said is endorsed by labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin and supported by the business community 
rep pat williams dmont predicted early house approval of 
the bipartisan measure which he said would stop the explosion 
the epidemic of lie detector tests used against employees and 
prospective employees 
williams and other house negotiators accepted without dissent a 
senate amendment that would allow private employers to administer 
carefully controlled lie detector tests as part of a theft 
investigation within a company 
the conditions for such tests are that the employee had access 
to the stolen property that the employer had a reasonable 
suspicion that the worker was involved and that the employer 
details the incident and the reasons for his suspicions in a 
written statement 
senate negotiators accepted a house provision allowing employers 
to give polygraph tests to security guards and employees handling 
certain controlled drugs as long as strict standards are met and 
the results are not the sole basis for adverse action against an 
employee 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the labor and human 
resources panel said the bill would effectively prohibit as much 
as 85 percent of lie detector tests currently administered by 
private employers 
the bill would not cover federal state or local government 
employees or private contractors involved in government 
intelligence or national security work 
according to a summary of the bill it is intended to 
eliminate the denial of employment opportunities by prohibiting 
the least accurate yet most widely used lie detector tests 
preemployment and random examinations and providing standards 
for a safeguards from abuse during tests not prohibited 
williams said the house which approved its original bill last 
nov 4 was expected to pass the compromise soon followed by the 
senate which had approved its version of the measure on march 3 
i think we have produced a bill which will offer longoverdue 
protections for millions of employees and job applicants 
longoverdue standards for those tests not prohibited by the 
legislation and hopefully a bill which the president will sign 
into law as soon as congress sends it to him kennedy said 
hatch said business executives who initially opposed the bill 
eventually supported it when they realized that these quickie 
polygraph tests are unfair and very detrimental to their 
employees

pat robertson said today the failure 
of his republican presidential bid hadnt shaken his certainty that 
god had called him to make the race 
robertson who rejoined the christian broadcasting network 
today said on the networks 700 club 
obviously the question is if he called you why didnt you 
win well theres no doubt in my mind absolutely none whatsoever 
that the lord led me to do this i mean if i had any leading 
whatsoever in starting cbn i had a stronger leading to get 
involved in this race for the presidency no question 
robertson said his first television venture fell flat on its 
face 
im used to one start then the next one and the next one 
he said sometimes the lord perfects us and encourages us through 
experience and trials 
was the calling there yes was i overly optimistic i thought 
we were going to see wonderful things happen in iowa i thought it 
was happening 
robertson finished second to sen bob dole of kansas and ahead 
of vice president george bush in the iowa caucuses on feb 8 
however he finished fifth the next week in new hampshire and 
quickly became an alsoran in the republican race that bush has now 
sewn up 
the former television evangelist said that later in the week he 
would show videotapes and make further comments on several 
controversies that marked his campaign including his allegations 
that his network uncovered information about us hostages in the 
middle east 
he said he would show a videotape of a deposition by former rep 
paul mccloskey rcalif concerning mccloskeys allegation that 
robertson used his fathers influence to avoid combat in the korean 
war robertson sued mccloskey over that allegation but dropped the 
suit in march saying it was unfair to have to go to trial while 
trying to win the nomination 
robertson returns to the network he founded nearly 30 years ago 
as it is facing a financial crisis last year 645 employees were 
laid off because of plummeting donations 
at the same time robertson was preparing to announce the 
suspension of his campaign monday more cbn employees were being 
let go 
when asked what would be done to halt the slide robertson said 
the operation would become leaner 
after today i hope we nevr again have to lay off people he 
said 
robertson refused to say how many employees were laid off and 
cbn officials would not comment on the layoffs 
robertson left the 700 club the networks most popular 
program in terms of viewership and fundraising in 1986 to begin 
preparatory work on his campaign 
donations began to fall then the dramatic drop came last year 
with the scandals involving other television evangelists and 
robertsons official announcement of his candidacy 
he resigned as chief executive officer in october when he gave 
up his southern baptist ordination and became an official 
candidate his son tim was elevated to the post 
i assumed that i had built a very competent staff robertson 
said in an earlier interview and that they would be able to run 
cbn in my absence i did not realize that my personal presence on 
the 700 club is as important as it is to the audience 
in announcing the suspension of his presidential campaign that 
spent 22 million to gain 46 delegates to the national convention 
robertson said he planned to remain active in the party 
i suspend my candidacy but i do not now nor will i ever 
suspend my advocacy of conservative and moral principles he 
said 
robertson used the occasion to announce the formation of a new 
political action committee americans for the republic to fund and 
train conservative christian political candidates 
i will work for the election of conservative republicans to 
city councils school boards legislatures the house of 
representatives and the senate he said

a spanish supertanker hit by an iraqi 
raid last week exploded today and shipping executives said at 
least nine crewman from a nearby tugboat were missing 
meanwhile the iranian tanker bisoton was identified as the 
latest victim of steppedup raids by iraq on its foes oil shipping 
lanes 
the blasts today partially sunk the 235000ton barcelona and 
scuttled a norwegianflag salvage tugboat that was alongside 
according to shipping executives who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
nine crewmen from the tug the scan partner were missing and 
feared dead after the explosions the executives said 
the sources said bodies were washing up on the rocks and iranian 
army personnel were trying to recover them they did not know 
whether the bodies were those of the tugboat crew or of others 
missing in saturdays raid on irans larak island terminal in the 
strait of hormuz 
an estimated 22 seamen were killed or remain unaccounted for in 
the attack in which five ships were hit by iraqi jets according to 
salvage executives 
in additon to the 235000ton barcelona the ships hit were the 
564739ton liberianflag seawise giant the 457841ton 
britishflag burmah endeavour the 152004ton cypriotflag argosy 
and the 231712ton iranowned khark 
international tankers call at larak to pick up oil cargoes 
brought down the persian gulf by irans fleet of shuttle tankers 
in the latest raid lloyds said the 112445ton bisoton was 
attacked by iraqi warplanes monday off the iranian coast it said a 
fire broke out in the engine room but was quickly extinguished 
lloyds did not say whether there were casualties aboard the 
bisoton but it had referred earlier to information that 10 seamen 
were killed in an iraqi raid on a tanker monday 
it did not link these casualties with the bisoton but there were 
no other attacks reported monday 
the baghdad high command reported monday that iraqi jet fighters 
raided a large maritime target off the iranian coast its usual 
terminology for an iranian tanker 
baghdads avowed aim is to throttle irans oil exports the 
backbone of tehrans economy and force iran to accept a negotiated 
settlement in the 7yearold war 
iran has responded to iraqs attacks by raiding neutral 
commercial shipping 
also today the us navy said it planned to drop a wreath in 
the waters of the central gulf to mark the first anniversary of the 
iraqi air attack on the frigate stark in which 37 americans were 
killed 
navy officials said the ceremony would be conducted by a 
chaplain aboard either a us warship or a helicopter there was 
no word on what time it would take place 
the stark was hit by two frenchmade exocet missiles fired by an 
iraqi warplane on the night of may 17 1987 as it conducted what 
the navy said was a routine patrol mission 
iraq later apologized for what it called a mistaken attack 
saying its f1 mirage fighterbomber was aiming for an iranian 
vessel the united states officially accepted baghdads explanation 
but demands for compensation for the ship and families of the dead 
crewmen have yet to be settled

the senate trying to pass a pentagon budget 
bill that has become a vehicle for antidrug efforts today 
overwhemingly voted to urge changes in us policy toward panama 
and its indicted leader manuel antonio noriega 
first the chamber voted 950 for a proposal by sen jesse 
helms rnc providing that no us aid be sent to panama until 
noriega leaves power and until president reagan certifies that no 
soviet or cuban troops are in the central american nation 
the amendment was aimed at noriega who has been indicted on 
us drug trafficking charges the reagan administration is 
negotiating with him to drop the charges if he agrees to leave 
power a plan that has drawn intense criticism in congress 
the senate later passed on a vote of 8610 a resolution offered 
by senate republican leader bob dole of kansas that put the senate 
on record in opposition to any deal in which us drug trafficking 
charges would be dropped 
the decisions on the panamarelated measures were scheduled as 
part of the senates effort to finally approve the huge bill 
we should not dismiss these indictments wed be making a 
mistake dole said today his amendment is a nonbinding sense 
of the senate resolution he said the white house opposes it 
he said dropping the charges against noriega would send the 
wrong signal in the war on drugs 
sen pete wilson rcalif said dropping the indictments is a 
very dangerous signal to send a deal that would allow this man 
to escape justice is a deal that stinks 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said the us efforts to remove 
noriega was not merely ineffective i believe they work against 
the return of democracy to panam the indictments should be left in 
place 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said the administration has painted itself and our nation on the 
corner on this matter 
also unresolved was a separate proposal by sen alfonse damato 
rny which would let courts impose the death penalty on drug 
dealers convicted of killing people 
the american people are entitled to this protection said 
damato i think we have to find a clearer message for those who 
deal in drugs the deathdealing drug lords fear no one 
sen carl levin dmich said damatos proposal had nothing 
specifically to do with the pentagon budget and should be 
considered in another forum senate rules do not require that 
amendments be germane 
levin also opposed the amendment because he said studies have 
shown that people sometimes are wrongly convicted of crimes 
the main reason im opposed to capital punishment is that you 
cannot correct your mistakes levin said time and time again 
weve found that weve convicted the wrong man 
the overall bill authorizes pentagon spending of 2995 billion 
in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
senate passage would send it to a housesenate conference 
committee to be reconciled with the house version of the pentagon 
budget although both measures propose 2995 billion there are a 
number of major differences 
one conflict is over the militarys role in the antidrug war 
the house bill orders reagan to have the military essentially 
seal off us borders against drug traffickers 
the senate measure is not as farreaching in the antidrug 
field but senators approved a plan last week to give the military 
broad new powers to help fight the drug war the most controversial 
provision of the senate antidrug package authorizes the navy to 
arrest suspected drug traffickers who are picked up on the high 
seas outside us territorial waters

interior secretary donald p hodel today 
designated as a national historic landmark the maryland farm where 
the pumpkin papers that led to the conviction of alger hiss 
were hidden 
whittaker chambers the late owner of the farm and the man who 
hid the stolen state department documents in a hollowedout 
pumpkin was an historical figure of transcendent importance in 
the nations history hodel said 
in a speech at the heritage foundation a thinktank promoting 
conservative causes hodel noted that the avdisory board of the 
national park service on april 26 had opposed landmark status on 
the grounds that 50 years had not passed since the significant 
events in question the discovery of the papers in 1948 by a young 
congressman named richard nixon 
i appreciate that the board disagrees but i do not choose to 
follow its advice in this instance said hodel who nominated as 
a landmark the 220acre farm at westminster md some 30 miles 
northwest of baltimore now owned and worked by chambers son john 
the service generally prefers the passage of 50 years to permit 
an assessment of the signifance of a property without the pressure 
of judgments made at the time 
john chambers deputy staff director of the congressional joint 
committee on printing said when informed of hodels action we 
are deeply honored by this designation and very pleased by the 
secretarys action 
hodel noted that national park service director william mott had 
written him on april 28 that the staff of the service concluded 
that whittaker chambers was exceptionally significant and that 
the farm represents that significance with the requisuite degree of 
historical integrity 
both the maryland state historic presevation officer and a 
professional review committee for the landmarks program including 
historians outside the national park service had supported 
landmark designation for the farm hodel said 
chambers then an editor of time magazine accused hiss a 
former state department official then serving as president of a new 
york foundation of being a fellow member of a communist spy ring 
in the late 1930s 
in testimony before the house unamerican activities committee 
hiss denied the allegation and sued chambers for libel chambers 
then produced from the pumpkin copies of 1937 state department 
documents he said hiss had given him 
the government won a perjury conviction against hiss for lying 
to congress in his denial that he had been a spy the pumpkin 
papers were key evidence prosecutors proved they had been typed 
on a typewriter owned by hiss 
hiss who lives in new york served 44 months he dropped his 
libel case against chambers who died in 1961 hiss maintains his 
innocence to this day and has declined comment about the landmark 
designation 
designation as a national landmark brings the owner a plaque and 
no obligation except to maintain the historical integrity of the 
property the national park service may take back the plaque if it 
is not so maintained some 1800 properties have been awarded 
plaques

israeli foreign minister shimon peres said 
today he and secretary of state george shultz agreed that the 
soviet union is now willing to join the stalled mideast peace 
process 
peres emerging from an hourlong meeting with shultz prior to a 
call on president reagan said us officials told him the soviets 
had increased to 1400 the monthly exit permits given to jews 
wishing to emigrate 
there is no doubt that one can learn from that about 
increased soviet liberalism toward the usorchestrated peace 
plan for arabisraeli talks peres told reporters 
the soviet role in the peace plan will be a topic at the 
superpower summit in moscow later this month peres said adding 
that he and shultz had devoted their entire talk to the kremlins 
position 
peres said he had told the soviets at meetings last week in 
spain and in hungary that they have to do more and in a more 
determined fashion to boost the flagging peace initiative 
i told them that their fear of the arab reaction is 
exaggerated because the arabs need peace talks no less than we 
do he said the soviets have expressed concern privately that 
their radical arab allies might be angry if they joined the peace 
process 
syria a close ally of moscows rejects the shultz plan but the 
more moderate jordan has said it welcomes soviet participation 
peres said he had been told in his talks here that the soviets 
have expressed concern about the proliferation of 
surfacetosurface missiles in the mideast in the wake of 
revelations that saudi arabia had bought such rockets from china 
the united states and israel have criticized the clandestine saudi 
purchase of the intermediaterange css2 missiles 
reagan is expected to try and infuse the shultz plan with new 
life after the midapril deadline for its implementation passed 
with neither israel nor jordan making up their minds whether to 
reject or accept it 
reagan who has warned israel and jordan against rejecting the 
peace plan is expected to stress his view that the us blueprint 
is the only solution to the fivemonth rebellion in which 180 
palestinians have been killed by israeli troops 
but neither side held out much hope that reagan would be able to 
budge the plan initiated earlier this year by secretary of state 
george shultz 
there are several new ideas but theyre minor and we dont 
expect great progress said a senior israeli official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity he declined to discuss the ideas saying 
they were not meaningful in the short run but incremental in the 
big plan 
peres explored these ideas with shultz at a meeting monday and 
was to continue discussions with him at two sessions today shultz 
will bring peres ideas to jordan and egypt when he visits the 
region on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting june 3 
peres supports the shultz plan which calls for arabisraeli 
peace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanent 
members of the un security council the united states soviet 
union china england and france 
but his rival in israels fractious governing coalition prime 
minister yitzhak shamir has rejected the formula out of concern 
that the five powers would pressure israel into relinquishing lands 
it captured from the arabs in the 1967 mideast war 
general elections scheduled in israel for november are expected 
to serve as a referendum on the plan 
underscoring support for his stand leading administration 
officials attended a luncheon in peres honor hosted by israeli 
ambassador moshe arad the guest list included shultz who toasted 
peres creativity in searching for peace formulas as well as 
defense secretary frank carlucci white house chief of staff howard 
baker and senate leaders

school board leaders have promised that two 
members will quit using chauffeurs within 30 days in return for the 
states agreement to sell 30 million in shortterm notes to cover 
teachers paychecks 
it has been agreed the detroit board of education will be in 
compliance within the next 30 days board president gloria c 
cobbin said monday 
the school board which is 60 million in debt faced a possible 
payless payday later this month for the districts 18000 employees 
without the 30 million shortterm bonds from the state 
the board is going to have to be accountable to the community 
our children have to be first cobbin said 
state treasurer robert bowman said he would authorize the 30 
million note sale which probably will take place next week 
if theyre not in compliance the notes issued would be in 
jeopardy bowman said it would damage the district in terms of 
credibility for probably a dozen years 
bowman postponed the sale of the notes because two board members 
continue to use the chauffeurs despite an agreement last november 
that the chauffeur service would be dropped 
rose mary osborne one of the members who continue to use 
chauffeurs had told the detroit free press on sunday that if she 
could not have her driver she would refuse to attend all evening 
board meetings for the 2 years remaining in her term

democrats michael dukakis and jesse jackson battled it out today 
in the oregon primary while pat robertson returned to the 
christian broadcasting network saying his failed republican 
candidacy didnt shake his faith that god had called him to make 
the race 
dukakis in springfield mass called for defense cuts to help 
pay for elderly care saying these are the choices weve got to 
make and we havent been making them he also strongly endorsed 
the social security system declaring that for many elderly people 
its the difference between dignity and poverty 
robertson rejoining the network he left to run for president 
said today obviously the question is if he called you why 
didnt you win well theres no doubt in my mind absolutely none 
whatsoever that the lord led me to do this 
republican nomineetobe george bush was on the west coast 
where one day earlier he took angry exception to the most recent 
published report linking his staff to a drugsandarms network 
involving nicaraguas contra rebels bush hinted it would take 
expletives to express his feelings on the matter and accused sen 
john kerry of massachusetts of leaking information thats not 
fair or true 
dukakis the farandaway democratic frontrunner was favored 
to win todays contest in oregon which offered a prize of 45 
delegates but jackson who campaigned persistently and 
passionately in the state was making a final appeal for votes 
today 
oregons secretary of state barbara roberts predicted a low 
turnout about 50 percent of the states registered voters for 
todays primary only a few statewide items were on the ballot 
a poll taken last month gave dukakis a wide lead in oregon but 
jackson has spent much more time in the state 
i want to win in oregon and take that momentum to 
california jackson said on a primaryeve stop in eugene ore 
californias contest three weeks from today is the granddaddy of 
all primaries with 314 delegates 
bush who was campaigning today in california told a rally at 
california state university at fresno on monday night that he 
couldnt wait to take on the democratic nominee in november 
but a poll published today suggested bush trailed dukakis in a 
hypothetical matchup according to the cbsnew york times survey of 
1382 adults taken by telephone from may 912 dukakis was backed 
by 49 percent and bush by 39 percent with 10 percent undecided 
the margin of error was 3 percentage points cbs said monday night 
that was in line with a poll by louis harris amp associates 
released monday which gave dukakis a 7point lead the poll of 
2138 voters put the hypothetical race at 50 percent for dukakis 
43 percent for bush and 8 percent undecided also with a 3point 
margin of error 
bush who won praise from robertson as the latter left the 
presidential race in turn wooed robertson supporters in washington 
state where robertson won a super tuesday straw poll 
the vice president said after mondays unity meeting with 
robertson backers i didnt have to pledge anything but he 
praised robertsons family and faith agenda 
bush campaigning in washington state on monday was asked about 
a newsweek report suggesting his national security adviser donald 
gregg had links to an arms and drugs network involving the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
its just pure unadulterated ive got to watch my 
language he said later he termed the report slanderous 
i would challenge sen kerry to show some evidence and 
stop leaking out information thats not fair or true bush said 
in seattle 
kerry who chairs a senate subcommittee that is looking into the 
allegations could not be reached for comment monday night but he 
was quoted in todays editions of the washington post as saying 
neither he nor his staff leaked the information 
bush was also fending off questions about embattled attorney 
general edwin meese and panamas military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
the vice president who has advocated the death penalty for some 
drug crimes was asked by reporters in seattle on monday whether 
that should apply to noriega who is under federal indictment on 
drug charges he declined to comment 
the administrations dealings with noriega have been raised as a 
campaign issue by the democrats 
the vice president also asked by reporters in seattle about 
meeses firing of his chief spokesman terry eastland again 
declined to comment eastland said the attorney general who is 
under criminal investigation felt his spokesman had not been 
aggressive enough in defending him 
meese has abandoned justice jackson said as he campaigned 
in oregon 
dukakis was at the statehouse in boston again today but has 
been sounding themes of importance to the west at a boston news 
conference on monday he came out for limits on offshore oil 
drilling 
dukakis also brushed aside complaints from jackson who 
maintains that the backing of super delegates to the democratic 
national convention should reflect popular vote totals 
the super delegates who vote at the convention by virtue of 
their elective or party offices are not bound by primary results 
in their home states 
fairness is a reasonable expectation jackson said monday 
dukakis retorted we all knew what the rules were 
by the latest ap delegate count dukakis has 1610 to jacksons 
956 with 2081 needed to nominate dukakis aides say they hope to 
clinch the nomination in the final primaries

a woman must return from california to wear a 
sign identifying her as a child molester a king county superior 
court judge has ruled 
julie guptillgilbert formerly a montessori teacher pleaded 
guilty in march to two counts of communicating with minors for 
immoral purposes both involving 4yearold girls she originally 
had been charged with statutory rape in one case and indecent 
liberties in the other 
judge warren chan gave her a choice of 30 days in jail or 60 
days wearing the sign and she chose the latter 
therefore the 19yearold woman must return from california 
where officials said they would be unable to supervise her and 
wear the sign in the seattle area chan said monday 
the sign must say something like i am a child molester he 
said 
chan agreed to delay the date of his order until sept 1 a few 
weeks after ms guptillgilbert is to give birth but he refused to 
lift the order outright 
michael frost her attorney asked that the sentence be changed 
to 60 days of house arrest 
if the purpose was for ms gilbert to suffer some humiliation 
when she went in public i would submit she has suffered that a 
hundred times over with the publicity frost said 
chan said the purpose of the sign was to protect the public 
in neighboring oregon district judge dorothy m baker last year 
ordered richard j bateman 47 of portland to post signs on his 
house and car saying dangerous sex offender no children 
allowed the signs were a requirement of his probation he had 
pleaded no contest to molesting two children 
when a probation officer reported the sign on batemans house 
was obscured the judge scheduled a probation revocation hearing 
bateman failed to show up three weeks later a tip led to his 
arrest and the judge resentenced bateman on feb 10 to the maximum 
10 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today 
refused to allow television coverage of a presummit white house 
briefing saying television distorts information 
fitzwater was responding to a request to admit television 
cameras to an ontherecord briefing being given by rozanne 
ridgeway the assistant secretary of state for european affairs 
the briefing is one of a series being held in advance of 
president reagans may 29june 2 meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev in moscow most have been held under background 
rules which do not permit the briefers to be identified 
afer turning down the request for television coverage fitzwater 
said he would be willing to take the request up with ms ridegway 
and that he would consider a request to permit radio coverage 
the spokesman was also asked why he does not routinely permit 
television camers in his own ontherecord briefings as spokesmen 
for the state department do 
they have more courage than we do he replied it is too 
high a risk for me you cant talk on camera you cant discuss 
issues you end up with a very stilted kind of conversation and 
also i dont think press spokesmen ought to become television 
personalities 
you open yourselves up to all sorts of problems unique to the 
power of television he said it distorts information and 
portrays information that is different than real substance 
after several television reporters protested his decision 
fitzwater turned to his staff and said we should have gone to 
background like we did all the rest

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis called today for cuts in defense spending to pay 
for elderly care saying these are the choices weve got to 
make 
the massachusetts governor favored to win todays democratic 
primary in oregon against jesse jackson addressed more than 1000 
senior citizens before returning to the statehouse 
dukakis also scheduled a late afternoon meeting with california 
rep mel levine a house foreign affairs committee member and 
authority on usisrael relations another in a series of 
consultations with leading congressional democrats 
dukakis told the conference on aging that in order to assist the 
elderly with affordable housing longterm health care and public 
transportation he would reduce or eliminate an array of military 
programs including the star wars missile defense more 
supercarrier task forces the midgetman missile and a proposed 
space plane that could fly from washington to tokyo in three 
hours 
these are the choices weve got to make and we havent been 
making them dukakis said 
he also said he would not try to balance the federal budget by 
denying costofliving increases in social security 
nobodys going to tell me social security is a middleclass 
entitlement its the difference between dignity and poverty 
dukakis said 
later talking to reporters dukakis said he believed that 
wealthy senior citizens should have to pay taxes on their social 
security benefits 
on monday dukakis brushed off polls that said he would fare 
well in a november battle with george bush and said ive got to 
win this nomination first 
although dukakis spent little time in oregon compared with 
jackson he said he wasnt taking anything for granted this is 
going to be a long tough and contested race he told reporters 
on monday 
dukakis has won eight of the last nine primaries and is far 
ahead of jackson in the delegate race 
a cbsnew york times poll published today suggested dukakis had 
a comfortable lead over bush the apparent republican nominee in a 
hypothetical matchup a louis harris amp associates poll released a 
day earlier showed similar results 
fortynine percent of the 1382 adults interviewed by telephone 
may 912 in the cbstimes poll favored dukakis 39 percent favored 
bush and 10 percent were undecided cbs reported monday night the 
margin of error was 3 percentage points 
in the democratic race jackson has been complaining that the 
proportion of super delegates backing him has not been in line 
with the percentage of the popular vote he has received 
dukakis also has won the majority of endorsements by super 
delegates democratic party leaders and elected officials who 
are convention delegates but not bound by primary results in their 
home states 
fairness is a reasonabale expectation jackson said monday 
in new jersey which like california holds its primary june 7 
i dont agree with him dukakis said when told of jacksons 
objections we all knew what the rules were this is a campaign 
for delegates as well as votes 
the massachusetts governor was brushing off questions about his 
budget problems at home contending revenue shortfalls are a 
national problem 
figures released monday indicated the state has a 243 million 
shortfall for the fiscal year ending june 30 166 million more 
than had been projected a month ago 
the governor who has made his fiscal competence a campaign 
selling point said massachusetts would trim planned program 
expansions and tap cash reserves that were to go to capital 
improvements and other projects to balance the current budget he 
said he would have to substantially trim his proposed budget for 
next year

for jesse jackson california offers a 
last hope of blunting michael dukakis momentum but for dukakis 
and vice president george bush the states june 7 primary is a 
trial run for the fall race for the white house 
jackson is throwing nearly all of his remaining resources both 
time and money into his campaign for the 314 democratic delegates 
at stake in california 
he plans to outspend dukakis by as much as 31 on television 
advertising in the state during the next three weeks and he is to 
spend at least 15 days about twice as much time as the 
massachusetts governor in his final push for california votes 
still the most recent gallup poll reported dukakis leading 
jackson among california democrats by 67 percent to 26 percent 
dukakis western states political director richard ybarra 
predicts that californias election night returns will put dukakis 
over the total needed to clinch the democratic nomination new 
jersey new mexico and montana also have primaries june 7 
we believe we can clinch it here that night im talking 
about going over 2081 says ybarra a longtime california 
political activist and the soninlaw of farm labor leader cesar 
chavez 
on the republican side bush is campaigning as intensely as if 
he still had active primary opponents and needed californias 175 
gop delegates but bush is clearly aimed at the fall campaign in 
which californias 47 electoral votes could be pivotal 
california has ended up in the republican column in eight of the 
last nine presidential elections and republicans have cut the 
democratic registration lead in half in the past decade however 
bush trailed dukakis by 10 percentage points in the most recent 
poll of california voters 
neither bush nor dukakis has any political roots or strong ties 
to california and pollsters say the support for both in the golden 
state is soft and still tentative that has led both men to plan 
intense primary campaigns in california 
jackson meanwhile isnt conceding california or the democratic 
nomination to dukakis despite the long odds 
why do i run against the odds ive faced odds all my life 
jackson told supporters at rallies in a california trip last 
weekend you must not surrender we really can win 
sounding the same dontgiveup theme jacksons california 
cochairman state assemblyman tom bates told other supporters 
we can dream the impossible dream and make it happen in 
california 
but pollster mervin field who has been surveying and analyzing 
california voters for over 40 years said last week that a jackson 
victory in california would be a monumental upset ranking as 
one of the biggest political happenings since the country was 
founded 
still a number of factors give encouragement to jacksons hopes 
for a california upset not the least of which is the demonstrated 
willingness of california democrats to vote for black candidates 
although blacks constitute only 8 percent of californias total 
population a black man los angeles mayor tom bradley has won the 
democratic nomination for governor the past two elections and 
other blacks have been elected in recent years as lieutenant 
governor and state schools chief 
the lack of other major issues on the june 7 ballot also could 
help jackson if his strongly motivated supporters turn out in 
greater percentages than other voters 
california democrats also have shown no inclination in recent 
years to join a frontrunners bandwagon in the past three 
presidential campaigns the democratic nomination was clinched 
before californias lastinthenation primary and in all three 
cases a majority of california went for the alreadyvanquished 
underdog candidate 
but other strong forces are against jacksons chances in 
california 
the states strong economy with unemployment near a 20year 
low blunts the impact of jacksons appeal to the economically 
disadvantaged and the spanishspeaking dukakis has hopes of a 
strong showing among hispanics who by far are californias largest 
minority 
finally pollster field suggests that jacksons greatest 
strength his charismatic oratorical skills may be less of an 
advantage in california than elsewhere because californians have 
had more experience with charismatic leaders and have greater 
reservations about them 
california voters had their fascination with ronald reagan as 
a detached governor and detached president they had their fling 
their lovehate relationship with jerry brown who intrigued them 
and promised a lot as governor but delivered very little field 
said 
but i sense the mood of the state today is one where theres 
less toleration for that and they want demonstrated competence 
dukakis i would say fits the mood of todays california 
voters

a counterattack by amal fighters gained 
ground against the rival hezbollah militia tuesday in the 12th day 
of their war for control of south beiruts shiite moslem slums 
the battle raged in violation of another ceasefire sponsored by 
syria and iran syria supports the mainstream amal and iran backs 
the radical hezbollah whose name means party of god 
police said 15 people were killed and 51 wounded on tuesday 
they put the number of total casualties at 240 dead and 757 wounded 
since fighting began may 6 in the 16 square miles of slums where 
groups affiliated with hezbollah are believed to hold most of the 
nine americans and nine other foreigners missing in lebanon 
sounds of exploding artillery shells mortar rounds and 
rocketpropelled grenades carried throughout beirut which has been 
battered by 13 years of civil war 
the latest truce the seventh since fighting began was called 
for 11 pm monday after syria massed 7500 soldiers and 500 tanks 
and armored vehicles on the edges of the enclave next to the 
airport the syrians have about 25000 soldiers in north and 
lebanon and 7500 in moslem west beirut 
syria agreed to give political efforts a chance after irans 
acting foreign minister ali mohammed besharati held several 
meetings monday with government and military leaders in beirut and 
damascus capital of syria 
a meeting he called for tuesday between representatives of amal 
and hezbollah to discuss a political settlement did not take place 
however because amal refused to attend 
hezbollah had driven amal to the fringes of the slums but a 
police spokesman said the counterattack tuesday regained most of 
shiyah one of the slum neighborhoods 
amal militiamen inched across shiyah and regained most of the 
district in fierce housetohouse clashes but hezbollah 
remains in control of 90 percent of south beirut said the 
spokesman whose name was withheld in keeping with regulations 
an amal official said the militia commanded by justice minister 
nabih berri refused to send a representative to the 
besharatisponsored meeting at the iranian embassy in moslem west 
beirut 
we told them that we do not accept a meeting at the iranian 
embassy he said speaking on condition of anonymity the 
affairs of the shiite community should only be discussed at the 
lebanese supreme shiite council 
sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin heads the council he reiterated 
that syrian forces should move into south beirut and disarm the 
warring militias 
in a statement broadcast by beirut radio stations he said 
the plight of the population is my main worry this suffering 
will end only when the syrians move in every other method is just 
a waste of time helping only to prolong the plight of the 
population 
interior minister abdulla rassi also urged the syrians to take 
over the slums 
political solutions have failed to end the fighting he 
said these clashes will only come to an end when the regular 
syrian force moves in to enforce law and order 
the amal official said berri and senior aides would meet in 
damascus with president hafez assad of syria who has become 
lebanons main power broker 
assad supports iran in its war with iraq but has grown concerned 
recently about the iranian challenge to his influence among the 12 
million shiites who make up lebanons largest sect 
about 20000 shiites demonstrated in the southern port of tyre 
they waved posters of assad and berri calling on the syrians to 
occupy south beirut 
we dont want iranians we dont want hezbollah marchers 
chanted 
one banner said we call on the syrian command to save our 
children in south beirut 
brig gen ghazi kenaan chief of syrias military intelligence 
in lebanon met with besharati at the iranian embassy in beirut and 
told reporters without elaboration 
we are searching for solutions and means to apply these 
solutions we shall exert efforts and take all the appropriate 
measures we are seriously searching for solutions to overcome this 
crisis 
besharati said in light of these meetings i do not believe 
there is a need for the deployment of syrian forces in south 
beirut the ceasefire will be respected after which we will work 
to withdraw the gunmen 
we are working with the syrians to prevent the recurrence of 
such differences in the future 
asked whether they discussed the hostages and their possible 
release besharati said all issues could be raised in these 
these meetings we hope this crisis will be over he did not 
elaborate

israeli foreign minister shimon peres met with 
president reagan today and said he believed the soviets will join 
the stalled middle east peace process during the forthcoming moscow 
summit meeting 
asked whether he expected the president to take a direct hand in 
such a development peres told reporters yes i think the 
occasion will really be in the summit meeting to have the russians 
adopt the needs of the middle east and not the middle east 
sbumitting to ideas that were born in moscow 
i expect to have a sort of an international opening that will 
not necessarily impose a solution or control the sitaution but will 
really permit the people of the middle east to negotiate freely 
he said 
i expect it to be raised he said i dont know if it can 
be solved in one jump but i am convinced it will be continued 
peres also said that in meetings with soviet officials in 
europe the soviets went the longest possible way to convince us 
that they are serious in their support of peace that they are not 
enemies of israel that they are looking for an occasion to improve 
the relations 
earlier emerging from an hourlong meeting with secretary of 
state george p shultz peres said us officials told him the 
soviets had increased to 1400 the monthly exit permits given to 
jews wishing to emigrate 
peres said he had told the soviets at meetings last week in 
spain and in hungary that they have to do more and in a more 
determined fashion to boost the flagging peace initiative 
i told them that their fear of the arab reaction is 
exaggerated because the arabs need peace talks no less than we 
do he said the soviets have expressed concern privately that 
their radical arab allies might be angry if they joined the peace 
process 
syria a close ally of moscows rejects the shultz plan but the 
more moderate jordan has said it welcomes soviet participation 
peres said he had been told in his talks here that the soviets 
have expressed concern about the proliferation of 
surfacetosurface missiles in the mideast in the wake of 
revelations that saudi arabia had bought such rockets from china 
the united states and israel have criticized the clandestine saudi 
purchase of the intermediaterange css2 missiles 
reagan has warned israel and jordan against rejecting the peace 
plan 
neither side held out much hope that reagan would be able to 
budge the plan initiated earlier this year by secretary of state 
george shultz 
there are several new ideas but theyre minor and we dont 
expect great progress said a senior israeli official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity he declined to discuss the ideas saying 
they were not meaningful in the short run but incremental in the 
big plan 
peres explored these ideas with shultz at a meeting monday and 
was to continue discussions with him at two sessions today shultz 
will bring peres ideas to jordan and egypt when he visits the 
region on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting june 3 
peres supports the shultz plan which calls for arabisraeli 
peace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanent 
members of the un security council the united states soviet 
union china england and france 
but his rival in israels fractious governing coalition prime 
minister yitzhak shamir has rejected the formula out of concern 
that the five powers would pressure israel into relinquishing lands 
it captured from the arabs in the 1967 mideast war 
general elections scheduled in israel for november are expected 
to serve as a referendum on the plan

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis told enthusiastic homestate senior citizens 
tuesday that military spending should be deeply cut to pay for 
services for the elderly 
the next president is going to inherit an awful fiscal mess 
and hard choices are going to have to be made dukakis told more 
than 1000 people gathered for the sixth annual governors 
conference on aging 
are we going to spend 6 billion on star wars and mx missiles 
on railroad cars or are we going to build affordable housing for 
families of low and moderateincome and the elderly he asked 
are we going to spend 36 billion for new supercarrier task 
forces that we dont need and cant afford or are we going to 
begin to do something about longterm care for elders and the 
disabled in this country 
later dukakis was returning to the massachusetts statehouse in 
boston to meet with rep mel levine the california democrat a 
member of the foreign affairs committee and an expert on 
usisraeli relations is the latest in a string of visitors to 
dukakis office 
last week dukakis met privately at the statehouse with sen 
bill bradley dnj to discuss the soviet union 
dukakis who was favored to win tuesdays democratic primary in 
oregon over jesse jackson again shrugged off jacksons criticism 
of the partys delegate selection process saying all the 
candidates knew the rules when they entered the race if changes 
are needed dukakis said they should be made after this falls 
election 
asked about recent polls indicating that dukakis holds a lead 
over republican vice president george bush in a hypothetical 
general election dukakis offered a rare comment on poll results 
all i can say is i think theres something cooking out there 
he quickly added that he thinks poll results mean very 
little 
in his speech dukakis also suggested he would cut funding for 
the midgetman missile and a proposed space plane using the 
money instead for improved public transportation and human services 
these are the choices weve got to make and we havent been 
making them dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor also expressed strong support for 
social security but said wealthy recipients should continue to pay 
taxes on their benefits 
he said he recalled being asked by a reporter in iowa whether he 
favored continuing federal support for middleclass 
entitlements 
the governor said he was puzzled by the question because 
twothirds of social security recipients live on that check and 
that check alone 
nobodys going to tell me social security is a middleclass 
entitlement its the difference between dignity and poverty 
dukakis said to applause 
afterward talking to reporters dukakis said he believed that 
betteroff senior citizens should continue to pay taxes on their 
social security benefits but he argued against trying to balance 
the federal budget by denying costofliving increases to social 
security recipients 
in the speech dukakis endorsed legislation filed by rep claude 
pepper dfla intended to expand health and other services to 
elderly patients in their homes 
dukakis said he was proud that massachusetts is one of the few 
states sing state money to support home care for elders and 
said the time had come to expand the approach nationwide 
i think its about time we reached out to millions of seniors 
across this country he said arguing that home care provides 
many elderly citizens with needed services while allowing them to 
remain independent in familiar surroundings 
in the long run its a moneysaver as well dukakis said 
but he added none of this unfortunately is going to come on 
the cheap

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
battled jesse jackson in the oregon presidential primary on 
tuesday a west coast warmup for their final election showdown 
early next month in california 
dukakis was heavily favored to defeat his sole remaining rival 
and win the majority of the 45 delegates at stake just as he has 
won every primary but one over the past seven weeks to assume 
unquestioned control of the democratic race 
dukakis also looked to oregon to help him inch toward the 2081 
delegates needed to gain the democratic nomination he has 1613 
delegates to 956 for jackson and his aides express confidence that 
he will control a nominating majority by the time the primaries end 
next month 
vice president george bush who already owns a delegate majority 
on the republican side looked to add oregon to his column in the 
gop primary his final active opponent once and future television 
evangelist pat robertson suspended his campaign on monday 
dukakis was so confident of his success in oregon that he 
decided against airing television advertisements and limited his 
personal campaigning in the state to parts of two days 
jackson devoted more time than that to oregon and seemed to 
needle dukakis when he said i earn my votes every day but he 
posted no predictions of victory has won only the district of 
columbias primary since march 8 and more often than not has been 
buried by dukakis landslides in recent weeks 
oregon seemed little more than a sidelight to neighboring 
california and its huge cache of 314 delegates 
both jackson and dukakis turned the state into something of a 
stopover point in and out of california which is one of four 
states holding democratic primaries on the final day of the primary 
season june 7 
jackson plans to invest heavily there in hopes of defeating 
dukakis although public opinion polls indicate the massachusetts 
governor holds a strong lead 
dukakis also is making a major effort in california in part to 
hold off jacksons challenge but also to lay the groundwork for his 
expected fall campaign against bush

thousands of students hurled rocks and 
firebombs in a clash with riot police tuesday to mark the eighth 
anniversary of a bloody civil uprising in the southern city of 
kwangju 
the current wave of protests which began monday continued to 
spread as dissidents and radical students prepared to mark the 
protests on may 18 1980 in which 200 people died in the city of 
kwangju 165 miles south of seoul 
on tuesday about 22000 college students in seoul and the 
provincial cities of kwangju taejon chongju pusan and chonju 
took part in antigovernment and antius protests according to 
the south korean news agency yonhap 
about 2000 students fought with police on 17 campuses in seoul 
down with the military dictatorship and yankee go home 
the students shouted as they clashed with riot police about 40000 
us troops are based in south korea whose government the united 
states has supported 
armored police vans fired salvos of tear gas bombs into the 
crowds while martial arts squads charged the protesters at least 
two students were injured in the fighting and several police 
officers were hit by firebombs 
the nations 130000member police force was on full alert with 
security squads deployed around government buildings and foreign 
diploamtic missions in seoul 
about 4000 students also hurled rocks and firebombs at police 
in kwangju the protesters marched with a large sign showing a 
broken american flag 
go home yankees who supported the chief culprits in the 
kwangju massacre the students chanted 
they also burned effigies of president roh taewoo who took 
power feb 25 after winning the elections in december he has 
promised to introduce democracy and has ended many of the 
authoritarian polices of former president chun doohwan 
many koreans are distrustful of roh a former general and they 
demand a full accounting of the kwangju revolt 
radical students and dissidents hold him and other top leaders 
who were military commanders at the time responsible for 
suppressing the 1980 rebellion 
punish culprit roh taewoo the students shouted 
antigovernment demonstrations marking the kwangju anniversary 
have been routine but this years protests riding on an 
opposition victory in last months legislative elections seem to 
be more widespread

ritual suicide of a dissident student at seouls myongdong 
cathedral on sunday 
cho sungman 24 a chemistry major at seoul national 
university demanded the release of all political prisoners before 
stabbing himself in the stomach and jumping from a building

protests they said they plan to make his burial site a 
sanctuary for their democratic movement

the near certainty that bush and dukakis will win their party 
nominations has turned the remaining primaries into virtual 
formalities with the outlines of the general election campaign 
beginning to take shape 
two nationwide public opinion polls released this week showed 
dukakis leading bush and the two men swap charges almost routinely 
as they make their campaign rounds 
in another sure sign that the nominating hostilities are fading 
both bush and dukakis have begun making plans to help retire 
campaign debts left over from rivals campaigns 
jackson the only other active candidate on either side 
complained during his oregon campaign that he was not getting the 
support from party leaders that he deserves 
but even so if he intends to play a spoiler to dukakis hes 
kept his intentions well hidden 
the two democrats held a private meeting when their paths 
crossed in new jersey on sunday and the massachusetts governor 
sounded anything but worried about the prospects for party unity 
this fall 
dukakis spent much of the past week behaving like the 
frontrunner he is meeting with democratic congressional leaders 
in washington conferring with south africa bishop desmond tutu and 
trying to raise doubts about bush 
i dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug 
runners and murderers he said in repponse to reports that the 
united states would drop drug charges against manuel noriega if the 
panamanian dictator agreed to leave his country 
i think before we start talking about dropping indictments and 
making deals the american people deserve a full explanation of 
what kind of relationship this administration has had with 
noriega dukakis said 
but dukakis also ran into heckling by gay political activists in 
california who challenged a massachusetts policy that gives them 
low priority in determining suuitablity to be foster parents 
bigot shouted one man while another yelled youre 
antigay why dont you admit it 
the vice president also launched a few attacks at dukakis and 
gingerly began setting himself apart from president reagan as he 
neared the end of his primary campaign 
he said dukakis was an extremely liberal democrat whose 
election would cause a radical swing in defense policies 
as for the president whom he has served loyally for seven 
years bush said i dont think weve been doing enough to 
protect our environment in recent years we need to do more 
particularly on the subject of acid rain 
bushs last remaining active opponent robertson officially 
abandoned his effort on monday but seemed to indicate interest in 
another run in 1992 if bush is defeated this fall 
robertson who became known to millions through his religious 
broadcasting resumed his leadership of his christian broadcasting 
network on tuesday

massacre site a historic district thursday the 68th anniversary of 
the conflict depicted in the film matewan in a move to 
nominate it for the national register of historic places 
paul mcallister director of matewan development center said 
the area to be nominated includes the buskirk building and the 
alley behind matewan where the shootings are believed to have 
occurred 
what has come to be known as the matewan massacre occurred in 
1920 when detectives working for coal operators tried to arrest 
mingo county constable sid hatfield who supported miners trying to 
join the united mine workers union nine to 13 people died in the 
shootout including the mayor and several detectives 
hatfield was later shot on the courthouse steps in welch where 
he was on trial for murder in the massacre 
the john sayles movie matewan was released last summer and 
enjoyed critical acclaim although it was not a box office success 
the movie was filmed in thurmond in fayette county because matewan

looking for a lawyer interview several learn 
their backgrounds and specialities bargain with them over fees and 
get any agreements in writing 
that is some of the advice on lawyershopping from everyday law 
a new consumeroriented magazine published by the nations trial 
lawyers 
some newspapers and magazines have regular law columns but this 
will be the first fulltime consumer law magazine said anne grant 
who pioneered its development and is editor 
people are gradually becoming aware that they need to know 
more about the law she explained so it was a natural 
connection for the association of trial lawyers of america to 
launch the magazine 
trial lawyers specialize in suits between people and in 
defending people accused of crimes thus the group is oriented 
toward consumer and individual issues grant said 
but how will association members react to a magazine that 
advises potential clients to consider mediation instead of 
lawsuits to shop around for lawyers and to bargain with them over 
fees and services 
the advisory board which includes consumer advocates lawyers 
and others was pleased with the first issue said grant 
they feel if you can get out of the legal system things that 
dont belong in there the system will operate more efficiently 
we want to help people avoid problems some will arise anyway 
but we want to avoid those that are avoidable 
in addition to advice on choosing a lawyer the first issue 
explains the legal aspects of product warranties discusses the 
taxpayers bill of rights under consideration in congress examines 
the legal ramifications of sexually transmitted disease advises on 
dealing with real estate developers gives an overview of the 
consumer federation of america and has an interview with peoples 
court judge joseph a wapner 
future issues will consider prenuptial agreements sports 
officiating lemon laws dealing with dentists insurance 
adjustors car insurance laws affecting boating and government

after listening to a jesse jackson speech that 
stirred him to tears atlanta mayor andrew young embraced jackson 
and then wrote a letter to the man with whom he has often clashed 
you make me feel proud and humble when i hear you speak 
young wrote martin luther king jr would be proud too you 
have my full endorsement as the moral voice of our time 
the letter written after jacksons speech at a recent 
fundraiser in san francisco marked just one of several times that 
young has reached out to the democratic presidential candidate in 
the past month 
he called jacksons home in chicago after the new york primary 
to express concern over jacksons fatigue and to congratulate him 
on what young considered the dignified way he had run his campaign 
despite attacks by new york mayor ed koch 
his followers have been telling me that he really is out there 
alone that the people around him are pulling at him for power and 
he really needs some people who just love him and are concerned 
about him to tell him that hes doing good young told the 
atlanta constitution in an interview published tuesday 
and so a number of people in the last month or so have been 
saying that from time to time i ought to call him and just tell 
him what i think 
young said many people have misunderstood his differences with 
jackson and he believes jackson shares that misunderstanding i 
think he feels that i am standing in judgment the mayor said 
young was among those who publicly disputed jacksons first 
account of his role in the minutes that followed the 1968 
assassination of king in memphis tenn he has said jackson was not 
the last person to speak to king was not on the balcony when king 
was shot and did not cradle the dying man in his arms 
the atlanta mayor also was among the black leaders who 
criticized jacksons decision to run for president in 1984 calling 
it at one point an extremely dangerous strategy that would 
build up and then deflate the hopes of poor americans 
and young has questioned whether someone who has never held 
elective office would have the preparation needed to handle the 
presidency 
in the interview young acknowledged the help jackson has given 
him in his own election campaigns and added by the same token i 
think i have been his defender too that part never gets 
publicized the public does not know about it 
if i said anything questioning what jesse did or said and it 
wasnt even questioning the fact that i would not be a true 
believer made me an enemy and i have just resented that i dont 
buy that

judgment

now and predicted he will do well against bush 
as a former democratic president carter is a delegate to the 
convention in atlanta this summer he said it is still his

rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre and the vatican 
have reportedly reached an agreement that will end a 
schismthreatening dispute that dates back to the reforms of second 
vatican council in the 1960s 
the italian news agencies ansa and agi without indicating their 
sources reported tuesday that an official announcement of the 
settlement was expected soon possibly after pope john paul iis 
return on thursday from south america 
the milanbased newspaper il giornale and il resto del carlino 
of bologna carried similar unattributed reports this week 
lefebvres case has been handled by cardinal joseph ratzinger 
who as head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith is 
the vaticans guardian of theological orthodoxy 
officials of the congregation declined to say if an agreement 
had been reached with the 82yearold french bishop who was 
suspended by pope paul vi in 1976 from his priestly duties 
including saying mass they referred inquiries to the vatican press 
office which said it had no comment 
in defiance of the vatican lefebvre has ordained priests and 
celebrated the tridentine mass a banned 16thcentury liturgy in 
latin he claims millions of followers and sympathizers and much 
enthusiasm for the latin mass 
john paul ii wrote ratzinger in april in which he said he was 
hoping for a settlement with the rebel archbishop 
the news reports said lefebvre had agreed to accept the 
conclusions of the second vatican council among the councils 
legacy to the roman catholic church is the present custom of 
celebrating mass in the local language an emphasis on ecumenism 
or promoting better relations between various faiths and catholics 
and a broader more active role by lay people 
lefebvre had agreed to accept the councils reforms but without 
renouncing traditional ways the reports said 
the agreement which ansa said was reached after lefebvre and 
ratinzger met in rome in early may reportedly would allow the 
archbishop to consecrate bishops 
lefebvre was quoted in february as saying he planned to 
consecrete three bishops in june that act without vatican 
permission would lead to excommunication from the church and set 
the stage for a possible schism 
lefebvre has ordained more than 200 priests in the past 15 years 
without vatican permission 
his traditionalist pius x fraternity based in switzerland 
would again have vatican approval according the the reports 
in october pope john paul ii gave cardinal edouard gagnon the 
task of working toward a settlement in the case 
in his letter to ratzinger in april the pope possibly 
establishing the framework for the reported agreement cited 
possible problems and advantages of both conservatism and 
progressism in the church 
progress sometimes does not take into account the function of 
tradition the pope wrote which is fundamental to the churchs 
mission 
on the other hand john paul wrote conservatism stops at the 
past itself without taking into account the correct aspiration to 
the future 
in switzerland spokesmen at the fraternitys rickenbach 
headquarters and at the traditionalist seminary in econe declined 
comment they said lefebvre was in france and the fraternitys 
superior general the rev franz schmidberger was in the united 
states until june 
a wellplaced traditionalist source who insisted on anonymity 
said he considered the reports of a reconciliation to be 
credible 
the french catholic monthly trente jours reported that a secret 
meeting in rome april 1113 between vatican experts and 
traditionalists gave new hope for peace between econe and the 
vatican 
it quoted an authorized vatican observer as saying that 
there were only two potential obstacles in the way of a 
reconciliation an extremist group in the traditionalist movement 
that might make lefebvre change his mind or some national 
episcopates opposed to recognizing lefebvre

president reagan said tuesday the united 
states must modernize its intelligencegathering system regardless 
of what arms control treaties are negotiated with the soviet union 
it is important for our national security interests that our 
country have all of the means necessary to assure compliance with 
these agreements reagan said in a statement 
with or without future arms control agreements it is 
important to our national security interests that we keep pace with 
changes in technologies in other nations 
the presidents statement supported bipartisan efforts in 
congress to upgrade the socalled national technical means the 
system by which this country among other things uses 
sophisticated satellite technology to monitor compliance with arms 
control agreements 
reagans comments were released shortly after he met privately 
with the two ranking members of the senate intelligence committee 
and as the senate prepared to open floor debate on the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
sen david boren dokla the committees chairman told 
reporters that reagan gave him and sen william cohen rmaine a 
real commitment to make sure that our national security interests 
are protected by continuing to modernize our national technical 
means 
in his statement the president said i welcome bipartisan 
support to start this year on a multiyear program to improve these 
systems 
i will also include funding for the second year of this 
program in the final budget which i submit to congress he said 
and i will urge the next administration to assure continuity of 
this vital effort after 1989 the funding for this program should 
be additive to the 2 percent real growth objective for national 
security spending 
neither reagan nor the senators indicated how much money was 
being envisioned for the modernization program 
boren said the congressional armed services and intelligence 
committees have been concerned about the need to improve our 
national technical means to modernize those systems to keep

a top education department official on tuesday 
blasted a rand corp study partially financed by his agency that 
acquitted teacher unions of obstructing school reform 
chester finn jr an assistant secretary whose office of 
educational research and improvement paid 35000 for the study 
said the rand researchers engaged in very selective reporting 
and did a poor job of analyzing events in the six states they 
examined 
the report teacher unions and educational reform 
concluded despite charges to the contrary teacher unions have 
not been a major obstacle to educational reform 
it did not name names but education secretary william j 
bennett has accused unions of trying to hijack the reform 
movement with demands for more money without stricter 
accountability 
the rand study said unions generally have accommodated reforms 
even if they had misgivings about such initiatives as career 
ladders for teachers 
i dont think the report is an accurate depiction of the state 
of affairs finn said in an interview weve got a much longer 
list of hijacking episodes than they have of accommodationist 
episodes 
the rand study reviewed 151 teacher contracts and examined the 
impact of reform laws in six states arizona california florida 
georgia minnesota and pennsylvania 
finn said unions have fought bitterly with governors in 
tennessee texas new jersey and indiana over career ladders 
competency tests for teachers alternative certification methods 
and other reforms the teachers union in st louis mo is in 
court battling a plan to tie teacher evaluations to student 
performance he noted 
even if the unions accommodated reforms that seemed inevitable 
finn said going along with something only after its clear you 
cant beat it is scarcely a very positive thing to say about a 
professional organization 
he claimed unions are still engaging in guerrilla warfare 
against reform efforts aimed at upgrading the quality of teaching 
the rand report said rankandfile teachers are unwilling to 
accept reforms as a substitute for breadandbutter improvements in 
their basic working conditions 
lorraine m mcdonnell coauthor of the rand report with anthony 
pascal said we certainly stand by our data and what we saw in 
these six states 
we chose six states that had different approaches to reform 
we didnt want to choose all the southern states she said 
to finns charge that just going along with reform was hardly 
praiseworthy mcdonnell said those reforms could not have been 
put in place had there not been accommodation and cooperation from 
the local teacher unions had the teacher unions wanted to 
sandbag them they probably could 
eighty percent of americas nearly 23 million public school 
teachers belong to unions and 60 percent of them are covered by 
collective bargaining contracts 
the rand study cost 75000 with rand itself contributing the 
larger share of the costs

hundreds of dresses from the 1920s and 1930s some 
by top designers like coco chanel have been found in trunks left 
in a stable in 1937 by one of the first britons to sell elegant 
secondhand clothes 
textile specialist annemarie benson of auctioneers phillips 
said tuesday the collection of about 600 dresses will be sold at 
auction june 2 she estimated the dresses including 80 to 100 by 
top paris couturiers would bring nearly 40000 
the dresses come from the estage of robina wallis who died last 
year at age 87 in the 1930s her mother ellen mary wallis began 
selling clothes by designers such as chanel worth callot soeurs 
vionnet and molyneux that had been worn by socialites and 
ladiesinwaiting at buckingham palace at the time secondhand 
sales were very new and very discreet 
when mrs wallis husband died in 1937 she and her daughter 
moved from devon to wartha manor on the cornwall peninsula and 
trunks containing hundreds of dresses were put in the stables 
miss benson said the silk velvet and chiffon dresses many 
handbeaded and embroidered remained untouched for a halfcentury 
when they were found by the executors of miss wallis estate 
the trunks had been stepped on the horses had kicked them and 
cats had been sleeping on them the newspaper lining the trunks 
was dated 1937 miss benson said 
although some dresses are slightly damaged many are in 
excellent condition she said this was a very exciting find 
theyre more sort of cocktail and dinner party dresses than 
ballgowns but youd look very swish in one of these today

supporters of gay rights legislation say they 
are thrilled the baltimore city council gave the bill preliminary 
approval after twice rejecting it in the last eight years 
im ecstatic said curt decker a lobbyist for the baltimore 
justice campaign after monday nights 126 vote in an overflowing 
council chamber ive worked on this eight years its time that 
it happened 
decker predicted final passage when the bill is taken up again 
next week the baltimore justice campaign which handles issues 
facing the gay community in this largely roman catholic city began 
working in december to marshal support for the bill it prohibits 
discrimination against homosexuals in housing employment 
education health and welfare services 
similar bills have been passed in several other cities 
including new york philadelphia washington dc and atlanta 
baltimores catholic leadership has opposed the bill but this 
time gay rights advocates got critical backing from mayor kurt l 
schmoke and city council president mary pat clarke during his 1987 
mayoral campaign schmoke promised support for the measure which 
his predecessor in city hall gov william donald schaefer had 
never endorsed 
opponents including placardcarrying parents pushing their 
children in strollers in front of city hall on monday immediately 
vowed to collect enough signatures to force the issue to a 
referendum 
an amendment exempted religious organizations from the bill 
based on the doctrine of the separation of church and state mrs 
clarke said 
we leave some judgments to god she said but try to give 
everyone an equal position at the starting gate 
councilman mike curran explaining his negative vote said he 
had asked himself is this a civil rights matter or is it a 
special rights matter and concluded it would confer special 
rights on certain people 
councilman joseph t landers iii said it came down to voting his 
conscience 
i think we need to send a message out he said even if it 
only affects the lives of half a dozen people we will be 
recognizing justice 
we tried to protect religious principles weve also looked at 
the issue of discrimination in my heart i know from all of the 
values i was brought up with i cant deny there is 
discrimination 
john glorioso sporting a baltimore justice campaign sticker 
said opponents who gave religious arguments for their opposition 
were failing to show christian attitudes 
their concerns are really unjustified theyre unable to be 
rational theyre really fixated on parts of the bible and seemed 
to ignore other parts of the bible basically its a hysterical 
issue glorioso said 
nonetheless supporters and opponents peaceably sat side by side 
during the council session 
next to glorioso wearing vote no stickers were susan walsh 
and her husband mike walsh 
although they have no children mrs walsh said they were 
concerned about the effect its going to have on our children 
she said opponents feared the precedent set by establishing 
homosexuals as a minority if students are taught the history of 
such minorities as women and blacks then you could have 
homosexual week and teach about how they got started and what they 
do she said

the us navy on tuesday marked the first 
anniversary of the iraqi air attack on the uss stark by dropping a 
wreath in persian gulf waters where the frigate was hit by two 
errant missiles with the loss of 37 lives 
during the ceremony a navy chaplain offered a prayer and a 
sevenman rifle team fired a salute from the deck of the destroyer 
uss stump 
we pause amidst our duties to honor men of stark who laid 
down their lives in service to country and to dedicate ourselves 
as fellow shipmates to the great task of protecting peace and 
righteousness among all nations said the chaplain lt cmdr 
jerry mcnabb 
flanked by a 24man honor guard in dress whites a chief petty 
officer and a seaman the oldest and youngest members of the 
stumps 325man crew tossed the wreath over the side cmdr 
constantine l xefteries the destroyers skipper also spoke 
mcnabb had attended survivors after the may 17 1987 attack 
according to naval sources who provided details of the ceremony 
the stump is one of the 16 us warships serving in the gulf 
having recently arrived as a temporary replacement for the frigate 
samuel b roberts the roberts a sister ship of the stark was 
severely damaged by an iranian mine last month 
the stark was hit by two exocet missiles fired by an iraqi 
warplane as it conducted what the navy said was a routine patrol 
mission in the central gulf 
ravaged by fires fed by unspent missile fuel and hot enough to 
melt the steel decks the 3700ton warship was saved from sinking 
by its crew and salvage tugs that rushed to its aid 
the main damage and most casualties were in the combat control 
center and the enlisted crew quarters as the missiles slammed into 
the 445foot vessel amidships just behind and below the bridge on 
the port side 
iraq apologized for what it called a mistaken attack saying the 
f1 mirage fighterbombers missiles were intended for an iranian 
vessel 
the united states officially accepted baghdads explanation but 
demands for compensation for the ship and families of the dead 
crewmen have yet to be settled 
the starks captain and tactical action officer were retired 
from the navy after an official inquiry held they had failed to 
protect the ship sufficiently from the possibility of attack 
the stark homeported at mayport fla is nearing completion of 
repairs and extensive overhaul at the ingalls shipyard in 
pascagoula miss four other perryclass frigates are in the gulf 
many us navy officers say the attack on the stark has led to 
tighter defensive measures aboard the american ships in the gulf 
where iraq and iran have been at war for 7 years

two suspected drug dealers trying to recover 90 
worth of crack cocaine stabbed and tortured three people dousing 
one with boiling water before rubbing salt into his wounds 
authorities said

memorial hospital with multiple knife wounds and seconddegree 
burns on his back and buttocks said hospital spokesman tom geddie

and two suppliers were trying to recover either the crack or 90 
the assailants came to an apartment occupied by the older man to 
collect daily drugsale proceeds according to police reports 
one victim said the crack had been flushed down a toilet the 
night before because of a rumor of a police raid no raid occurred

there had been one so the suppliers could be told police had seized 
the drugs

a house subcommittee chairman said tuesday he 
would investigate du pont cos plan to use 75 million in federal 
funds to pay severance benefits to 6500 workers at a nuclear 
weapons plant even though virtually all will keep their jobs under 
new management 
rep mike synar dokla said there is no logical or 
equitable reason for the taxpayers to provide a 75 million 
windfall to workers who will not lose their jobs or benefits 
solely to enhance du ponts corporate image 
synar charged that the department of energy which owns the 
savannah river nuclear plant in aiken sc has failed to actively 
resist du ponts plan to invoke costreimbursable language in its 
contract to pay severance to its employees when the company 
withdraws from the facility in october 1989 
he said he had instructed his staff to investigate the matter 
du pont designed and constructed the plant and since 1950 
operated it under government contract before deciding last year to 
pull out when the currect pact expires under doe rules the new 
contractor yet unnamed must offer jobs and comparable benefits to 
all du pont employees except for those in 37 key positions or among 
support staff at the companys wilmington del headquarters 
synar chairman of the house government operations subcommittee 
on the environment energy and natural resources said 
department of energy officials appear to be more concerned about 
protecting the corporate interests of private contractors than the 
government or taxpayers 
an energy department spokesman will callicott declined comment 
except to say its an issue still under review that review was 
triggered in april by the does own inspector general after it 
appeared initially that the department would accept the du pont 
plan 
synar in a letter to energy secretry john s herrington said 
this delay and inaction only casts doubt on does willingness to 
be aggressive in its stewardship of public funds 
synar asked doe to provide all internal analyses memos legal 
opinions communications responses and any other documents 
generated by doe or contractor staff or officials related to the 
severance pay issue 
earlier a du pont spokesman jim felder declined comment on 
the case except to note that our employment plans call for the 
payment of severance and we expect the federal government to 
reimburse du pont for the cost of severance 
under the plan du pont employees would receive a weeks pay for 
each year of service with the company up until sept 30 1985 that 
was the year when du pont and doe agreed to stop accrual of 
severance benefits for employees who actually would keep their jobs 
under new management 
synar said there has been no instance in which the government 
paid severance to workers who retained their jobs when there was a 
change of contractors at other federal nuclear facilities

the former leader of west germanys 
jewish community is suspected of embezzling millions of dollars 
from government reparations to nazi holocaust survivors his 
successor said tuesday 
werner nachmann is suspected of stealing more than 6 million in 
interest accumulated from holocaust survivor funds before his death 
in january said heinz galinski nachmanns successor as president 
of the jewish council of west germany 
i am shocked horrified and furious that such a thing could be 
even possible galinski said 
hessischer rundfunk radio in frankfurt reported the jewish 
council believes nachmann embezzled about 19 million from west 
german government funds for holocaust survivors between 1980 and 
1987 but galinski said the radios figure was pure speculation 
about 236 million were made available by the west german 
government in 1980 for holocaust survivors all over the world who 
had never made reparations claims 
the funds were in addition to about 47 billion already paid out 
by west germany to holocaust survivors or victims families who had 
applied for reparations 
after the death of werner nachmann financial irregularities 
of considerable proportions were discovered in transactions 
involving the funds approved in 1980 galinski said 
learning of this surprised and dismayed the councils 
directorate which immediately informed west german government 
leaders he said in an interview from his west berlin office 
galinski said the jewish council has hired financial experts to 
look into the accusations and the investigation is expected to 
take two to three weeks 
nachmann was in charge of the funds to be handed out to 
holocaust survivors hessischer rundfunk radio reported 
the radio said the jewish council believes nachmann transferred 
millions of dollars to dummy corporations which seem to be 
unknown to anyone 
galinski said the jewish council has asked a civil court in 
karlsruhe to freeze money from nachmanns estate pending an 
investigation into the allegations 
a court spokesman said no action has yet been taken on the 
councils application 
this is still in a preliminary stage spokesman alfred 
mueller said more documents and other information will be coming 
in on this matter 
mueller said that if the allegations against nachmann are proven 
true the money would have to be repaid from the deceased jewish 
leaders estate 
galinski said he was deeply upset about the possibility that 
nachmann may have embezzled money from the accounts 
this has presented me with the most serious problem i have 
ever faced in my 40 years of working for the jewish community he 
said 
the 62yearold nachmann died jan 21 of a heart attack at his 
home in karlsruhe 
he had been active in trying to help heal wounds in west germany 
left by the holocaust in which about 6 million jews were killed 
during nazi rule 
nachmanns family fled nazi germany to france in 1938 he 
returned to karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward 
reestablishing jewish communities in the country 
about 525000 jews lived in germany when the nazis took power in 
1933 west germany has about 30000 jewish residents today

us industry operated at 827 percent of 
capacity in april the highest level in more than eight years the 
government said tuesday economists said the report renewed 
inflation fears 
the federal reserve board said the operating rate at factories 
mines and utilities last month jumped by 03 percentage point from 
824 percent a month earlier it was the highest since march 1980 
when the operating rate was 837 percent 
the rate at manufacturing concerns increased from 826 percent 
in march to 830 percent in april 
economists attributed the climb to rising export sales spurred 
by the devalued dollar in a separate report tuesday the commerce 
department said the trade deficit in march shrank dramatically to 
97 billion as american exports surged 23 percent to a record 
2897 billion 
both reports show good health for the economy and a boom 
developing in the us manufacturing sector thats good news the 
other side of that is higher inflation and higher interest rates 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
interest rates edged up in the bond market after the two reports 
were issued 
economists consider an operating rate of 85 percent as 
inflationary they fear that prices will rise as factories have 
trouble meeting both demand in the united states and the rising 
appetite abroad for us goods 
operating rates in some industries paper textiles chemicals 
petroleum products already approach or surpass 90 percent 
we are in the danger zone and i think that is why the fed has 
been tightening said cynthia latta an economist with data 
resources inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
sinai predicted that overall operating rates would rise to the 
8485 percent level by october or november 
my guess is through no particular manipulation on the 
presidents part the election will be about the time when we have 
really closed up the slack both in labor and products markets he 
said 
the next president will have a new problem to think about 
how do you handle inflation and interest rates 
some analysts are hoping that corporations efforts to expand 
capacity will eventually ease the strain in a survey by the 
commerce department earlier this year businesses said they would 
spend 8 percent more than last year on new plant and equipment but 
sinai said demand for goods would likely increase faster than 
companies ability to expand 
the april gain in operating rates was the first increase since 
january when the rate stood at 825 percent the level fell by 01 
percentage point in february and was unchanged in march before 
that the operating rate had climbed for four successive months 
from 811 percent in september 
the april advance was led by the second steep monthly increase 
at car truck and automotive parts plants they operated at 809 
percent of capacity last month up from 794 percent in march and 
768 percent in february 
operating rates at factories producing durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years rose by 05 percentage point 
to 811 percent of capacity the rate for nondurable goods held 
steady at 857 percent 
the mining industry which includes oil and gas drilling 
operated at 815 percent of capacity up from 803 percent in 
march us utilities operated at an 811 percent rate last month 
down from 818 percent a month earlier 
the changes left the overall operating rate of 827 percent up 
sharply from a year earlier when american industry operated at 
796 percent of capacity

in power a top official said 
mikhail s gorbachev whose job as party general secretary is 
that which may be limited if the party acts himself has said the 
party needs to find ways to replace aging officials 
dmitri a lisovolik a deputy to party central committee 
secretary anatoly f dobrynin told members of the young presidents 
organization and a reporter monday night that proposals have been 
introduced to limit the party leader to two or three terms of eight 
years each 
he did not mention proposals for age limits and said he could 
not predict whether the proposals for fixed terms would be adopted 
lisovolik indicated that support had been growing for limits to 
the terms of communist party leaders 
a second official told a us newspaper that if limits are 
adopted it should not be considered a blow to gorbachev 
many letters have appeared in recent weeks in the soviet press 
proposing fixed terms and age limits for the countrys leaders an 
indication that the idea is being brought back under consideration 
gorbachev raised the idea of limits in the highest echelons of 
soviet power creating a mechanism to replace aging officials in top 
party jobs at a january 1987 meeting of the central committee 
he apparently met with opposition then because the meetings 
final documents only made passing reference to it 
the soviet leader has said more freqent turnover would make 
officials more accountable to the people he has criticized 
middlelevel officials for falling behind his calls for a 
restructuring of soviet society and says that confusion about his 
reform policy reaches to the highest levels of the communist party 
gorbachev has pushed aside many older communist party leaders 
who were uncomfortable with his policies but still faces stiff 
opposition 
he has sharply criticized the 196482 rule of former communist 
party chief leonid i brezhnev as a period of economic stagnation 
and corruption 
dictator josef v stalins abuses during his 29 years in power 
also are coming under increasing criticism as soviets reexamine 
their past 
the party conference that begins june 28 is considered to be a 
key opportunity for gorbachev to strengthen his hand in the 
policymaking central committee 
in its tuesdays editions the washington post quoted central 
committee member georgi a arbatov as saying there is a good 
chance the party conference will back proposals limiting the 
general secretarys term 
arbatov said the changes would not indicate any setback for 
gorbachev who has been general secretary since march 1985 
the young presidents organization is a group of foreign business 
leaders including americans a delegation of the group arrived in 
moscow on saturday 
lisovolik 50 has been chief of the us section of the 
international department of the central committee since december 
1984 he served briefly in the soviet embassy in washington under 
dobrynin who was ambassador from 1962 to 1986 dobrynin is central 
committee secretary in charge of foreign affairs

israel set up emergency telephone hotlines 
tuesday and readied insecticidespraying airplanes to fly into 
action against a possible plague of locusts the desert insects 
feared since biblical times 
only a small number of the yellow insects were sighted in 
southern israel and the jordan valley but officials warned of a 
possible larger invasion from the south and said the hotlines would 
remain open until the end of the week at least 
if they are not controlled locusts can destroy all the 
countrys crops and orchards in a matter of days said chaim 
hahan an agriculture ministry official working on the hotline 
if the winds are right they can travel about 130 miles per 
day he said they are fast and deadly 
locust migrations occur infrequently after a buildup of the 
population swarms of the insects can obscure the sun when they 
pass overhead and turn the ground black when they settle to rest 
for the night 
some crops are destroyed by the flying swarm but most of the 
destruction occurs after the insects lay eggs at night the larvae 
which hatch in 15 to 20 days devour all green vegetation 
the last serious locust invasion into israel was in 1959 then 
israel was younger and less modernized and many israelis banged 
pots and pans outdoors in an attempt to scare off the swarms 
hahan said it didnt work 
but this year israel is ready with planes and has asked 
residents to call the hotline if they spot insect swarms covering 
up to four to five acres which officials fear could come from 
egypts sinai desert where some have been seen 
it takes a swarm of 5000 to 10000 insects before we get 
really worried hahan said and even if a farmer sees that 
many he shouldnt take any action on his own wait for us 
israels concern was heightened by a fourday heat wave the 
worst in the country in 18 years warm weather is one environmental 
factor known to trigger locust migration 
due to hot winds from the north temperatures in parts of israel 
and the occupied west bank have reached 113 degrees this week one 
austrian tourist died after hiking in the area of the dead sea and 
suffering from heat stroke

rode the uss antrim about five miles into the atlantic ocean for a 
wreathlaying ceremony from the vessels stern 
nancy ciletta with daughters laura 4 and dawn 14 wiped 
away tears as they moved from the ships railing after tossing 
their tissuewrapped roses into the ocean 
id rather not go through it over and over the widow of 
john ciletta said i would rather just remember john as he was 
chaplain bill perry and capt john b mitchell jr mayports 
commanding officer memorialized the 37 as heroes as president 
reagan had in services last year 
standing before a stone and bronze monument to the stark at the 
mayport dock mitchell told the crowd sitting under white awnings 
that the reason for the observance was engraved on the memorial 
you will never be forgotten 
last may we were gods people caring for gods hurting 
people one year later we are now gods people caring for gods 
healing people mitchell said 
said the chaplain as the name of each dead seaman was intoned 
to the ringing of a ships bell even if you wanted to you could 
not forget the pain that personal pain that goes beyond 
description 
similar observances were held in pascagoula miss where the 
stark is undergoing a 100 million overhaul in washington and 
aboard many navy ships and installations around the world 
a wreathlaying ceremony was also held by navy ships still 
patrolling the central persian gulf where the stark was hit by two 
missiles fired by an iraqi jet 
at mayport flags on the base and aboard ship flew at half mast 
and the echo of taps wafted far out over the antrims wake 
following a 21gun salute by an honor guard 
many relatives of the dead took pictures of each other at the 
waisthigh monument others stared straight ahead or prayed 
silenty at times 
my only anger is at the iraqis at my sons loss said 
rodney erwin 50 a general motors plant supervisor from troy 
mich whose 22yearold son steve was among the victims the 
planes pilot reportedly said he mistook the stark for a tanker 
from iraqs enemy iran 
my son and i always loved the water added erwin aboard the 
antrim with his wife nancy we had boats all the time when he 
was growing up and when i was putting our little boat into the 
water the other day i cried 
joseph wilson a mail carrier from charleston sc the father 
of victim lloyd anthony wilson moved around the crowd before the 
services consoling some of the mothers who had lost their sons 
the thoughts and the pain are still the same after a year but 
the healing process is less severe he said life has to go 
on 
mrs cilettas message was similar as hard as it is you do 
survive and go on

mohammed ali hamadi indicted in 
the united states in the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner will 
stand trial in a west german juvenile court in july on charges 
stemming from the air piracy 
us navy diver robert stethem was shot to death during the 
hijacking that began on june 14 1985 on a flight from athens to 
rome and ended up in beirut thirtynine americans were held 
captive for 17 days in the ordeal 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem was indicted in the united 
states on air piracy and murder charges related to the act 
west germany turned down a us extradition request last year 
but after two west germans were kidnapped in beirut by the 
defendants brother west germany said he would be tried here 
hamadi was arrested in frankfurt on jan 13 1987 while 
carrying liquid explosives and false documents and has been jailed 
in frankfurt since then he was charged by west german officials on 
feb 8 with air piracy murder illegal possession of explosives 
and carrying a false passport 
on jan 17 1987 west german businessman rudolf cordes was 
kidnapped in beirut and three days later another west german 
alfred schmidt also was abducted in lebanon 
hamadis 29yearold brother abbas was arrested at frankfurt 
airport jan 26 1987 after arriving on a flight from beirut he 
was charged with kidnapping the two west germans in an attempt to 
win freedom for his brother 
abbas hamadi was found guilty by a duesseldorf court last month 
in connection with kidnapping the two west germans and sentenced to 
13 years in prison 
schmidt was released in september in what his captors said was a 
goodwill gesture but cordes remains a hostage 
justice officials have decided to open the case against mohammed 
hamadi in juvenile court in july hesse state court spokesman falk 
thomas said at a news conference no exact starting date was given 
for the trial which is expected to last several months 
the final decision to try mohammed hamadi before a juvenile 
court was made because his age at the time of the crime could not 
be determined he said 
mohammed hamadi first told west german authorities he was born 
on june 13 1964 but later he said he was two years younger 
under west german law an adolescent is described as between 
ages 18 and 21 an adult 21 and older and a juvenile as less than 
18 juvenile courts also handle adolescent cases 
if he is found guilty and the court determines that he was 21 
at the time the crimes he is charged with actually began the 
maximum sentence is life imprisonment thomas said 
a juvenile court may give a life sentence to an adolescent based 
on a determination of personal maturity at the time a crime began 
despite age said thomas 
he added however that the usual maximum sentence is between 10 
and 15 years in prison for an adolescent not judged as mature

belgrade residents have gone on a 
shopping spree snapping up important consumer items because of a 
government decision to postpone the lifting of a price freeze 
flour sugar coffee detergents and cooking oil were all 
reported to be in short supply newspapers said tuesday 
even furniture has become a hot item 
prices are expected to rise by fifty percent and more when the 
sixmonth price freeze is lifted later this month 
the largest circulation daily vecernje novosti described the 
buying spree as a fever on the eve of the defreeze in a 
frontpage headline tuesday 
the newspaper and belgrade authorities said sales of detergents 
went up by 100 percent last week while sales of flour rose by 50 
percent of cooking oil by 70 percent and of sugar by 45 percent 
the daily published an appeal by belgrade authorities not to 
hoard staple items already in short supply 
there is no need to hoard and create unnecessary queues the 
daily quoted the appeal as saying 
according to the newspaper shelves storing staple items in 
highest demand are virtually empty 
officials promised to restock the supply of coffee the first 
item to disappear from belgrade shops from emergency reserves 
vecernje novosti said 250 tons of coffee would be made available 
but the federal government meanwhile announced a 3 percent price 
increase on coffee going into effect immediately 
yugoslavians pay about 13 for 22 pounds of coffee 
the politika ekspres daily quoted the owner of one store as 
saying his furniture sales had doubled over the past two months 
local media have reported that about 80 percent of the countrys 
manufacturers will announce new prices for their goods when the 
government lifts the freeze 
the end of the sixmonth price freeze was originally scheduled 
for may 15 but was postponed for at least 10 days until the 
government secures about 300 million in emergency credits from the 
west 
the government has not set a specific date for the price freeze 
to be lifted but it is expected to be before the end of may 
the government said the emergency funds were needed to implement 
an economic package made in conjunction with the international 
monetary fund 
the package of economic measures which includes the lifting of 
the price freeze is intended to reduce europes highest inflation 
of 170 percent and help yugoslavia repay its 20 billion foreign 
debt 
yugoslavia is expected to secure 14 billion in new loans from 
the imf western governments and banks this year 
vecernje novosti said sales taxes were increased monday on 
carpets ready to wear clothes soaps tires tractors and coal 
stoves 
the governments austerity program is likely to contribute to a 
further decline of yugoslavs living standards which have already 
fallen by onethird since 1980 labor unrest is also expected to 
grow

as primary voters went to the polls 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson reminded oregon 
supporters on tuesday that he is the only candidate who made a 
major effort here 
i campaign amongst you because i do not take you for 
granted said jackson oregon can make a big decision today to 
change the course of america 
jackson campaigned five days in oregon in an attempt to build 
momentum heading into the crucial california primary on june 7 
jackson noted the 34th anniversary of the supreme courts brown 
vs board of education ruling that desegregated the nations public 
schools but said schools remain segregated economically 
in public schools 34 years later some children get 5000 
invested in them and some get 1600 he said there must be 
equal access for education its legally sound its morally right 
and its cost efficient 
jackson repeated his familiar comparison between the cost of 
school and the cost of incarceration he said one year of high 
school for a student costs 2500 in klamath county compared with 
a 15000 price tag to house an inmate for a year in the klamath 
county jail 
unless we have equal access to education we have unequal 
access to jail he said 
jackson was scheduled to meet wednesday with california leaders 
of jewish groups with whom his relations remain strained but the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said tuesday it would 
boycott the closed meeting 
to have it behind closed doors just creates more potential 
for disharmony between the jewish community and jackson than ought 
to exist said adl regional director david a lehrer 
jackson has been urged to mend fences with the jewish community 
still rankled by jacksons 1979 embrace of palestine liberation 
organization leader yassar arafat and his 1984 reference to new 
york as hymietown 
jews comprise about 10 percent of the california electorate

the interstate commerce commission gave final 
approval tuesday to the 80 million merger of greyhound and 
trailways the nations two largest bus companies 
the two bus lines have been operating as a single carrier since 
last july when the icc gave temporary approval to the merger 
because trailways was on the verge of going bankrupt while 
operating independently 
greyhound lines inc bought its biggest competitor trailways 
lines inc for 80 million the deal did not affect 34 small 
regional bus companies around the country that also use the 
trailways name 
fred currey greyhounds chairman called the icc decision a 
positive development in greyhounds efforts to rebuild the 
intercity passenger bus business and thereby increase 
competiton in the travel market 
the icc approved the deal by a 32 vote 
the final merger was likely to be little noticed by bus 
travelers 
george gravley a greyhound spokesman said the company would 
continue to use the trailways trademark on buses and terminals in 
parts of the country where the name is well known 
obviously were delighted by the decision gravley said 
in an interview from the companys dallas headquarters he said 
greyhound had expected final icc approval since the commission gave 
its tentative clearance to the deal last july 
together greyhound and trailways carried more than 33 million 
passengers last year the combined company which has its 
headquarters in dallas has 3750 buses and terminals or ticket 
agents in 2500 communities 
greyhound had announced in june 1987 that it planned to purchase 
trailways the icc granted its temporary approval to the merger two 
weeks later after the justice department concluded that as an 
independent company trailways had virtually no chance of being 
restructured as a viable entity

eight years after the bloodiest 
civil uprisings in south koreas modern history residents of this 
southern city are pressing for a full accounting of the deaths 
resulting from government force used against protesters 
at least 191 people died and more than 800 others were injured 
when the government deployed the army to crush a prodemocracy 
demonstration in this opposition stronghold in may 1980 
now thousands of people from various parts of the country make 
pilgrimages to kwangjus mangwoldong cemetery where the victims 
are buried 
a milelong road leading to the cemetery was neatly paved for 
this years anniversary and city authorities installed pay phones 
and supplied drinking water for visitors 
encouraged by an opposition victory in last months legislative 
elections many of kwangjus 800000 citizens are in a hopeful mood 
before the anniversary of the uprising on wednesday 
i am proud of kwangju in the long end we are beginning to 
have some breathing space said kim soonil a shop owner 
kim and many others plan to close their businesses to mark the 
day 
but the mood is marred by clashes between police and thousands 
of dissident students who are staging antigovernment protests 
they believe newly elected president roh taewoo and other top 
leaders who were army generals at the time of the 1980 uprising 
are responsible for the harsh military operations that resulted in 
the high casualty toll 
the dissidents continue to claim that the death toll from 1980 
is much higher than the government officially reported and demand 
punishement of those responsible for it 
rohs government which succeeded former president chun 
doohhwan on feb 25 has promised to begin a monthlong review 
starting monday into reports that many victims have not been 
accounted for 
during seven years of rule under chun the citizens of kwangju 
were considered political outcasts whom the regime labeled 
rioter or impure elements 
we are glad to have our honor back at long last said lee 
dalsun 35 a businessman we need a full accounting of the 
incident more than anything else 
roh also has promised to financially help kwangju victims and 
erect a monument dedicated to their democratization efforts 
financial compensation may be important but more important is 
the restoration of honor said kim yongan 31 who limps from 
gunshot wounds in the riots 
but radical students at kwangjus staterun chonam university 
say there is no compromise with the roh government which they say 
is no better than its militaryrun predecessor 
we should not let down our guards we must continue fight 
against the military dictatorship said a student leader who 
requested anonymity

4tyagon budget bill 
that has become a vehicle for antidrug proposals and a 
condemnation of administration proposals to cut a deal with 
panamas military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
the dispute involves an amendment proposed by alfonse damato 
rny which would permit the death penalty for drug dealers 
convicted of killing people 
we dont want to be the fly in the ointment delaying final 
action on the bill said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
but he said damato and other supporters of the death penalty 
plan would not drop their amendment until they were assured it will 
be considered at a later date 
damato complained that because of filibusters threatened by 
opponents weve been unable to get a straight vote on whether 
the death penalty should be imposed 
the two sides were trying to agree on a compromise but no final 
action on the bill will be taken before wednesday morning senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva told his colleagues 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan will talk about the drug problem in a commencement address 
wednesday at the coast guard academy in new london conn and said 
the president wants the nation to depoliticize the drug policy 
debate 
i think the president hopes that people will be careful and 
realistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort 
fitzwater said everybody wants to outdrug each other in terms 
of political rhetoric 
reagan is very frustrated with the progress of antidrug 
abuse efforts the spokesman added 
the bill authorizes pentagon spending of 2995 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 and includes a trio of antidrug 
provisions overwhelmingly added by senators who contend the us 
public wants sterner action to halt illegal drugtrafficking 
two of the provisions were approved tuesday in the wake of 
reports that the administration was willing to drop 
drugtrafficking charges against noriega if he steps down 
noriega has been indicted on drug charges in florida but he has 
refused to quit us economic sanctions have thus far been 
ineffective in forcing him out 
the senate voted 950 approval of an amendment by sen jesse 
helms rnc which provides that no us aid be sent to panama 
until noriega leaves power and until reagan certifies that no 
soviet or cuban troops are in the central american nation 
then the senate passed 8610 a resolution offered by dole 
which put the senate on record as opposing any deal in which us 
drugtrafficking charges would be dropped 
dole said wed be making a mistake by dropping the 
indictments the white house opposed his nonbinding resolution he 
told his colleagues 
sen pete wilson rcalif agreed with dole a deal that 
would allow this man to escape justice is a deal that stinks he 
said 
the american effort to remove noriega was not merely 
ineffective said sen nancy kassebaum rkan i believe they 
work against the return of democracy to panama the indictments 
should be left in place 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the administration has painted itself and our 
nation into the corner on this matter 
the main antidrug provision was added last week by the senate 
which voted 836 to give the military a bigger role in stopping the 
flow of illegal drugs into the country including new arrest powers 
for navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats on 
the high seas 
senate passage would send the bill to a housesenate conference 
committee to be reconciled with the pentagon budget bill passed 
last week by the house 
the house also added an antidrug provision but it was more 
farreaching that the senate bill the house ordered reagan to have 
the military basically seal off us borders against illegal 
drugtrafficking 
both bills authorize 2995 billion for the pentagon which 
would essentially freeze defense spending for a fourth straight 
year after large pentagon budget increases during reagans first 
term 
that was the amount approved by reagan last december in an 
agreement with congressional leaders on a spending package designed 
to reduce federal budget deficits the pentagon had expected to get 
about 333 billion for defense next year 
defense secretary frank c carlucci achieved the lower defense 
budget by ordering cuts of about 34000 personnel from the 
pentagons civilian work force along with retiring a number of 
older weapons including 16 aging navy frigates 
one difference to be resolved by the conference committee will 
be the question of a pay raise for the nations 21 million 
uniformed military personnel the house proposed a 4 percent 
increase while the senate measure includes the entire 43 percent 
hike originally sought by reagan 
another difference involves spending for the strategic defense 
initiative as reagans star wars antimissile program is known 
formally 
the house proposed 35 billion for star wars while the senate 
bill authorizes 46 billion reagan had sought 48 billion 
compared with the current 39 billion sdi budget

an aids victim fired from his clerktypist job 
at the justice department said tuesday he will turn down a oneyear 
temporary position offered to him in the wake of publicity about 
the incident 
im not going to accept they owe me my job back they fired 
me because i had aids mark gregory told rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo chairman of the house civil service subcommittee 
gregory said he has taken 30 days off since learning last 
october that he has aidsrelated complex a precurser to fullblown 
aids nearly half of the time to participate in a treatment study 
at another federal agency the national institutes of health 
despite what he called an excellent sixmonth evaluation early 
this year gregory was fired april 25 on the grounds that his 
absences made him incapable of performing his job 
the firing came several weeks after the office of personnel 
management had instituted a policy saying federal workers with aids 
had to be treated like those with other serious medical problems 
and could not be discriminated against 
mrs schroeder said a newly stated enlightened policy 
appears to have been thrown overboard within the first month she 
said she was dismayed by the justice department action and also by 
the departments refusal to testify tuesday on the grounds of short 
notice and the press of other business 
we will not let this go she said we want to make sure 
that federal policy is leading the way and not catching up 
mrs schroeder said she will hold another hearing june 2 and 
expects the justice department to testify unless the controversy is 
resolved to gregorys satisfaction before then 
the justice department offered gregory the temporary post on 
monday five days after the washington post published an article 
describing the incident 
but gregory said he would have no protection in a temporary job 
they could a week later say we dont need you anymore he 
said 
he also said the temporary job was in the same office as his old 
job where he said a supervisor had violated his confidentiality 
and word of his disease had spread among coworkers 
that would be an impossible situation gregory said they 
are insensitive to aids i doubt very seriously theyve made any 
educational effort since the day i was fired i dont know how 
people could change their attitudes that fast 
gregory said he took two weeks off immediately following his 
diagnosis at the suggestion of a supervisor who told him to get 
my act together he said another six days were devoted to 
doctors appointments and dealing with his roommates illness and 
death from aids shortly before gregory was fired

the mix of foods consumed by americans has 
changed dramatically since 1970 but some of those changes have 
been inconsistent an agriculture department report said tuesday 
of all the meat consumed in 1986 twothirds was red meat 
mostly beef pork and lamb compared with threefourths in the 
early 1970s 
instead we ate more poultry fish grains and cereal 
products the report said we also cut back on whole milk 
while consuming more lowfat milk and yogurt fresh fruit and 
vegetable consumption rose as well 
but the report added while there was a general shift toward 
foods perceived as low in fat or calories our cheese consumption 
increased during the period in addition consumption rose for fats 
and oils frozen potatoes and corn sweeteners and soft drinks 
and families ate fewer eggs and fresh potatoes and drank less 
coffee during the 16year period 
overall the changes in consumer habits were attributed to 
higher incomes new food production and marketing techniques and 
changes in lifestyles 
consumption of red meat declined but poultry more than took up 
the slack total meat consumption which includes poultry 
gradually crept higher 
the report was prepared by a team in the departments economic 
research service and was included in the agencys quarterly 
national food review 
in the early 1970s the report said americans ate an average of 
151 pounds of red meat annually on a per capita basis and about 49 
pounds of poultry in 1986 red meat dropped to 140 pounds while 
poultry averaged 72 pounds 
poultrys rise stemmed largely from retail prices that 
remained well below those for red meats primarily because of 
savings passed on from the farm and processing levels the report 
said as a result poultry was used to a greater extent in frozen 
entrees and convenience foods than red meats were 
but poultrys price advantage was not the only factor that 
affected consumers cutup birds and heavily advertised brand name 
items such as those of holly farms perdue louis rich and tysons 
foods gained popularity 
panready or precooked items along with upscale raw products 
such as boneless breast fillets also attracted consumers 
processors began offering chicken and turkey franks turkey 
breakfast sausages and turkey ham and salami in an effort cater to 
consumer concerns about fat 
other food processors and retailers joined the move toward 
valueadded items the report said dairy processors introduced 
fresh and microwave pizzas a variety of flavored and textured 
yogurts mexicanflavored cheeses fruit and onionflavored cream 
cheeses upscale frozen dairy products and readytomake quiche 
mixtures 
frozen vegetable processors developed new combinations sauce 
selections and singleserving products in microwave containers and 
supermarkets now have a wider variety of fresh produce than they 
had in the 1970s and have become more convenenience oriented with 
salad bars and soup kettles

madison avenue spoke to the socialist masses on 
tuesday night with soviet tv showing commercials that featured 
bottles of pepsicola popping their tops to the riffs of rock music 
sony tv sets and visa credit cards also flashed across the 
screens to millions of viewers during the lateevening premiere of 
a fivepart series on life in the united states 
they were the first paid commercials on staid staterun soviet 
tv and they came in advance of president reagan visit to moscow 
later this month 
each company had one brief advertisement on the hourlong 
program which featured commentator vladimir posner interviewing a 
panel of americans in seattle about life in the united states 
the ads broke clumsily without explanation into the show titled 
posner in america 
pepsis ad showed a group of young people looking for a way to 
open several bottles of pepsi a drink that has been available in 
the soviet union for almost 30 years when no bottle opener 
appeared a redheaded guitarist pops them open with long riff from 
his guitar and the screen proclaimed in russian the new 
generation chooses pepsi 
sony and visa got their chance around midnight moscow time 
about five minutes before the program ended 
visa showed athletes preparing for the summer olympics in seoul 
south korea and told viewers its credit card was good in any 
country in the world sony promoted the quality of its electronics 
products 
but sony electronics products and visa cards arent available to 
the average soviet consumer 
i expect we might get some angry letters from people saying 
why are you advertising sony tvs when we cant buy any posner 
had said earlier this month at a news conference announcing his 
series 
the colorful fastpaced commercials contrast sharply with most 
programming on soviet television two of pepsis commercials to be 
shown during the week feature pop star michael jackson who is 
wellknown to soviet youth from music videos shown occasionally on 
tv here and recordings that circulate unofficially 
one commercial has jackson dancing and singing his hit song 
bad another ends with a shot of us and soviet flags 
accompanied by pepsi labels in russian and english 
posner said the commercials arent being shown on soviet tv for 
consumer sales at least not right away 
we on our part can make some money out of this which in our 
day and age when we are becoming economically selfsupportive and 
selfsufficient also makes sense posner said 
interest in america is particularly high among soviets since 
reagan arrives may 29 for a summit with kremlin chief mikhail s 
gorbachev 
in the west commercials try to get consumers to buy one 
companys product over a competitors but in the soviet union 
theres no need to stimulate demand because consumer goods are in 
short supply posner said 
officials refused to disclose how much money the advertisers 
were paying for air time but reports in the united states said the 
soviet broadcast agency gostelradio received 10000 for each 
30second ad 
certainly its not competition its more establishing an 
image said edward wierzbowski vice president of global american 
televison inc a company based in colrain mass that deals in 
americansoviet television productions 
soviet tv already features infrequent homemade commercials that 
advertise shoes shortwave radios and personal stereos but the 
products they pitch arent always available 
posner who frequently appears as a soviet spokesman on us 
television said the purpose of sovietproduced commercials are 
more informing than pushing a product 
posner predicted foreign television sets might become available 
in the soviet union later this year visa international plans to 
issue credit cards through a soviet organization to soviets who 
travel abroad and foreigners living in the soviet union 
western commercials have been seen previously on soviet 
television during space bridges international satellite 
television programs involving discussions between americans and 
soviets but the advertisers did not pay soviet television for 
that air time 
posner said his programs audience was expected to be about 120 
million people

president reagan discussing two of his most 
persistent problems said tuesday that he retains complete 
confidence in attorney general edwin meese iii and declined 
comment on reports he was offering to drop drug charges against 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
asked whether he believed in astrology reagan said i dont 
guide my life by it but he said he could not say whether it was 
valid i dont know enough about it he added 
reagan opened his news conference with a statement hailing the 
agreement to start senate debate on the ussoviet arms treaty and 
the march trade figures which showed a dramatic drop in the 
monthly deficit in the balance of exports and imports 
most of the questions during the brief session concerned noriega 
we are in the midst of real negotiations said reagan 
referring to discussions the administration hopes will lead to 
noriegas relinquishing power i cant comment further on this 
there have been persistent reports that the administration has 
offered to drop drug charges against noriega in exchange for his 
leaving the country at least until after elections are held 
reagan said much of what has been written about the negotiations 
has been based on some kind of leaks or misinformation because 
there are no facts to sustain it 
on meese the president said i have complete confidence in 
him 
as for the firing of terry eastland the justice department 
spokesman who has been defended by conservatives the president 
said there may be more than meets the eye 
he did not elaborate on that statement except to tell reporters 
they should talk to the atttorney genenral about that 
reagan also dismissed reports that he and his wife nancy have 
considered astrological signs in determining his schedule 
nothing of that kind was ever going on he said 
it didnt happen that way at all reagan said of allegations 
by his former chief of staff donald regan that an astrologer 
influences decisions on presidential scheduling 
reagan who leaves next week for a summit in moscow with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev said he was confident that the senate 
would ratify the inf treaty which he described as a diplomatic 
milestone 
the agreement would eliminate us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles from europe 
on trade the president called the 41 billion drop in the 
nations trade deficit good news the best news on this front 
since march of 1985 
he cited the improved trade figures as evidence that restrictive 
trade legislation recently passed by the democraticcontrolled 
congress was not needed 
he said he expected to act on that legislation within a couple 
of days reagan is expected to veto the bill

a refugee camp in thailand administered 
by the communist khmer rouge may have diverted un food deliveries 
to guerrillas while blocking efforts to monitor how the aid was 
used sources said tuesday 
the un border relief operation halted food deliveries starting 
may 1 to huay chan a cambodian camp of about 9000 people in the 
eastern province of sisaket said the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a un source in new york who is familiar with huay chan and 
asked not to be identified said the camp operators were violating 
a cardinal principle involved in food aid that the delivery must 
be monitored and the un agency must know that it has not been 
misued 
that principle has not been assured in that camp and at 
several other camps for some time he said 
camp authorities had been given warnings about the monitoring 
problems and told that they risked a cutoff in aid he said 
he said that the camp appeared to have another independent 
source of food which could make the un food surplus for 
diversion 
they said the francebased operation handicap international the 
only other aid group working in the camp pulled out at the same 
time in coordination with the united nations agency 
the sources said the main concern in khmer rouge camps was 
diversion of food from civilians to guerrillas the camps all 
located near the cambodian border are believed to play some role 
in military infiltration into cambodia 
the agency has struggled for years to improve monitoring and 
delivery of medical and other services to camps run by the khmer 
rouge the main guerrilla group fighting vietnamese forces 
occupying cambodia 
the khmer rouge massacred millions of cambodians when they ruled 
the country from 1975 until vietnam invaded in late 1978 
some officials say the khmer rouge keeps civilians in its camps 
in thailand as virtual prisoners there have been reports of people 
dying of illness after camp authorities refused to allow their 
evacuation to an outside hospital 
the only khmer rouge camp where access by aid officials hasnt 
been a significant problem is site 8 a showcasetype camp housing 
33000 people in prachinburi province south of sisaket 
the other two guerrilla groups opposing the vietnamese 
occupation the noncommunist forces of son sann and prince 
norodom sihanouk allow free access to their civilian camps along 
the border about 300000 cambodians live in border camps 
the un agency earlier threatened to halt aid to four 
closed khmer rouge camps unless access was improved the 
sources said that during the past year improvements were made at 
natrao bo rai and ta luan camps where the agency finally was able 
to post camp officers and send regular medical teams these camps 
house more than 30000 people 
authorities at huay chan resisted however and did little more 
than allow relief officials on occasional escorted tours of the 
camp the sources said 
huay chan was not the only khmer rouge camp where access was 
a problem but it was most flagrant in denying access one source 
said their basic attitude was you leave the supplies at the 
gate of the camp and well distribute them 
aid wont be resumed until access is improved but the sources 
said huay chans administration has not reacted to the cutoff of 
food 
the un agency had been giving to huay chan a little less than 
a pound of rice per person daily and other foodstuffs it was not 
clear where alternative sources of food would come from but the 
khmer rouge is known to get substantial aid from china thailand 
and other countries the refugees raise vegetables and chickens in 
huay chan the sources said

the army stopped accepting deliveries of its 
new 9mm beretta handgun last november because of unexpected 
cracking in the frame and is now investigating a second problem 
involving the guns slide mechanism the service said tuesday 
beretta usa a subsidiary of the italian arms maker armi beretta 
spa has submitted a plan to deal with the cracking problem and the 
army expects to resume accepting deliveries next month said paul 
powell a spokesman for the armys armament munitions and chemical 
command 
in the meantime though the army has been forced to start a new 
test program to determine why two slide bolts on m9 berettas 
cracked while being fired throwing shards of metal back into the 
chests of the shooters a similar incident occurred with a 
nonmilitary beretta made for commercial sale that was being tested 
by the navy 
no one was injured in the three incidents which occurred late 
last year and in february powell said 
but we dont like the fact that if a slide ever did break it 
could go back and whack a guy in the face said col richard 
williams the army manager for the beretta program 
the problems with the handgun contract were first disclosed this 
week by the trade publication defense week and subsequently 
confirmed by army officials 
beretta usa which operates a manufacturing plant in accokeek 
md beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide 
9mm guns to replace the militarys venerable colt 45 the army 
serving as the executive buying agent for all the services awarded 
beretta an initial contract worth 75 million for 316000 pistols 
according to powell 109000 guns had been delivered before the 
delivery suspension in november all told the spokesman said 
beretta would fall about 36000 pistols behind in its deliveries 
before shipments resume in june 
beretta is about to face a new congressionally ordered 
competition with the massachusetts gunmaker smith amp wesson and any 
other interested arms maker for the next 9mm gun contract powell 
declined to discuss how the production problems might affect 
berettas chances 
the army said the first problem with the beretta surfaced in 
november when qualitycontrol testers discovered the pistols could 
develop hairline cracks on part of the frame the problem was 
considered minor and posed no danger to soldiers firing the gun 
but the army had made it clear earlier it would not tolerate any 
cracking and insisted the problem be fixed powell said 
the second problem involving the slide bolt which is thrown 
backward after a shot is fired as part of the process of chambering 
a new round materialized during navy and army tests after the 
delivery suspension began 
beretta maintains that the slide failures occurred only after 
special ammunition was fired 
us government engineers and technicians have extensively 
examined the metallurgy dimensions and manufacturing of the pistol 
and can find nothing which indicates that the cause of the breakage 
lies with the weapon the company said in a statement 
powell disputed that statement in part saying the army had not 
concluded that special ammunition caused the problem 
we are still running tests to determine the cause of this 
problem the spokesman said were not prepared to say its the 
ammunition it could be a design flaw ammunition the 
manufacturing process or misuse of the weapon we dont know yet 
in the meantime the navy has suspended all firearms training 
with the new beretta and the army has ordered the slides on its 
guns be replaced after every 3000 rounds fired 
the slide on one of the militaryissue guns that failed did so 
after 4500 rounds had been fired and the other after 6007 rounds 
the commercial beretta failed after 30000 rounds powell said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told irans 
leaders tuesday to patch up their differences now that 
parliamentary elections are over 
the elections strengthened the hand of economic radicals with 
whom the 87yearold revolutionary patriarch has appeared to side 
recently 
they seek land reform price controls and a minimum wage 
opposing them are conservatives backed by the bazaaris or 
merchant class 
a report monday in the french newspaper le monde said nine 
people were killed in the central province of isfahan during 
election violence between conservatives and revolutionary guards a 
radical organization with personal loyalty to khomeini 
speaking at the end of the moslem holy month of ramadan 
khomeini also wished death upon president reagan and saddam 
hussein the president of iraq with which iran has been at war 
since september 1980 
his remarks to a gathering at his home in north tehran were 
broadcast by state radio and television khomeini said in reference 
to elections for the majlis the iranian parliament 
a majlis without diversity of views is an imperfect majlis 
but the outcome should not result in dividing us into two hostile 
groups 
he said there were attempts to create discord which he did 
not describe but thanks to god they did not succeed 
in what appeared to be his first public reference to a division 
between radical and conservative thinking khomeini said 
there are not two fronts of course there are two ways of 
thinking and it should be so there are two opinions and there 
should be different tastes and views but different tastes do not 
mean the people should not be on good terms with each other 
the first round of elections for the 270seat parliament was 
held april 8 and the second last friday although little detailed 
information was available from the latest round results favored 
the radicals 
president ali khamenei told the gathering 
during the elections there were some harsh words said between 
certain candidates or their followers now that thank god the 
elections have been successfully completed these arguments should 
end too 
le monde said a conservative religious leader in isfahan 
province hojatoleslam ahmadi resigned during the election 
campaign as prayer leader of the mosque in the town of 
khomeinishahr to protest certain electoral methods used by the 
interior ministry 
his resignation prompted violent protests by his supporters in 
the town which were suppressed by revolutionary guards the paper 
reported le monde said three people were killed and several 
arrested including ahmadi 
he was imprisoned in the city of isfahan 12 miles away 
supporters demonstrated there for his release and some reports said 
six more people were killed according to le monde 
it said radicals won the elections in the isfahan area and that 
made the conflict worse 
khomeini said tuesday the best prayer for president reagan and 
hussein the president of iraq is to wish them to die 
this is for their benefit he said whereas if you want to 
curse them youd better wish them a long life the more they stay 
alive the worse their situation will become and their hell will 
become hotter therefore if you wish them death they will die 
quicker and avoid the hotter hell

the senate small business committee on 
thursday approved legislation designed to strengthen the federal 
governments program of fostering businesses owned by women and 
members of minority groups 
the committee also approved a fiscal 1989 reauthorization of 
small business administration programs at approximately the same 
spending level as this year some 53 billion 
the minority businesses aid program under section 8 a of the 
small business act has come under sharp criticism and public 
scrutiny because of the wedtech case and other scandals although 
it also has had its successes 
under the program created in 1968 certain government 
procurement contracts are set aside for companies owned and 
controlled by women and members of minority groups who are both 
socially and economically disadvantaged since there is no 
competitive bidding the process has been viewed by critics as 
particularly vulnerable to abuse 
companies can participate for five years but could receive a 
twoyear extension 
the senate measure calls for an eightyear fixed program term 
with no provision for extensions a companion house bill provides 
for a nineyear term 
the voicevote approval of the bill came after sen barbara 
mikulski dmd proposed an amendment and then withdrew it to 
provide for a 10year program then the committee accepted her 
amendment calling for a study of the program 
the committeeapproved measure also requires that participating 
concerns show that 30 percent of their business comes from 
competitive contracts outside the program after five years to be 
eligible for new contracts in the sixth year the percentage 
remains the same in year six but increases to 50 percent for the 
seventh and eighth years of participation 
the house version also calls for a varying mix of competitive 
contracts but recommends that they be goals and not requirements 
ms milkulski unsuccessfully proposed that the senate bill be 
changed from requirements to goals 
we dont want to create contract junkies but were putting 
the burden on small business when it should be put on the sba 
which has administered the program in a arbitrary and confusing 
way she said 
a staff study showed that 30 percent of the business fail after 
they leave the program 
similar to the house legislation the measure provides that 
contracts can be terminated by the government if the business is 
transferred or sold during the initial year of performance 
the committee also approved several amendments sponsored by sen 
carl levin dmich as an outgrowth of the wedtech case requiring 
unconditional ownership and a yearly certification of ownership 
the wedtech corp a bronx ny military contractor founded by 
a businessman born in puerto rico benefited from the federal 
program in four years it was awarded more than 250 million in 
military contracts in which there was no bidding 
wedtech which has filed for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law has been the subject of at least five state and 
federal criminal investigations 
there have been allegations that its executives bribed federal 
officials and conspired to obtain government contracts through 
fraud and misrepresentations

relatives and friends of the navy seamen 
killed during last years attack on the uss stark gathered at 
arlington national cemetery on tuesday to commemorate what one 
mother called unnecessary deaths 
i dont feel he should have been there or any of them should 
have been there and i dont feel they should be there now a 
tearful kathleen ciletta of philadelphia said of the deaths of her 
son john a ciletta jr and his 36 shipmates last may 17 it 
was very unnecessary 
although mrs ciletta said it was important that the memory of 
her son be kept alive in memorial services she still had a lot 
of anger in her heart 
anger toward the whole situation because i feel like he was 
killed for all the wrong reasons she said while clutching a 
miniature replica of the lone soldier statue presented to her 
by rear adm william thompson president of the naval memorial 
foundation 
during the service vice adm john w nyquist assistant chief of 
naval operations for surface warfare praised the slain seamen as 
examples of the selfless dedication and indomitable spirit of 
courage and patriotism of the men and women of the armed services 
we share a special and timeless bond a bond that only 
sailors and their families know nyquist said it is a bond so 
great that nothing can undo it not even death 
the stark one of several us ships stationed in the persian 
gulf to escort tankers and other vessels with american registry 
was attacked by an iraqi jet presumed to be friendly 
no effort was made to warn the plane away until it was too late 
and the fighter had fired two exocet missiles the second missile 
nearly sank the ship 
a navy board of inquiry concluded the starks officers should 
have prevented the tragedy by warning away the iraqi aircraft 
since the stark tragedy the navys rules of engagement in the 
gulf have been changed to allow ship commanders to open fire on any 
plane or vessel that comes close enough to fire upon their ship 
if the policy one year ago today was what it is today i 
wouldnt be here today neither would my son mrs ciletta said 
like i said it was a little too late for my boy 
the ciletta family was chosen to represent the families of the 
stark crewmen in the memorial service said carmella laspada head 
of no great love the sponsor of the program 
no greater love is a nonprofit support group for families of 
pows mias hostage and terrorist victims 
following the wreathlaying ceremony mrs ciletta planted a 
kiss on her sons tombstone 
he had just turned 21 when he was killed she said of her 
only son he turned 22 last week

ceiling sprinklers and a nearby hose fire spokesman john mulligan 
said there were no injuries and ms stern said damage was limited 
to some sportswear

next to saks forced the evacuation of the department store and

government opponents on tuesday 
denounced warnings given to broadcasters to exercise restraint and 
the opposition newspaper la prensa declared the muzzle law 
returns 
but the broadcasters appeared undaunted by the threats of 
sanctions and continued tuesday to criticize the leftist government 
the interior ministry summoned directors of eight private radio 
news programs saturday and cautioned them to be careful in reports 
about military recruitment the economy and government a vaguely 
worded communications law provides for sanctions as severe as 
closing the stations 
critics said the action was a backward step in the process of 
democratic reform 
the government began to lift press restrictions last fall as 
part of its compliance with a peace plan signed by the presidents 
of nicaragua el salvador costa rica guatemala and honduras on 
aug 7 
la prensa which had been closed for 15 months was permitted to 
reopen in october several news programs that had been barred were 
allowed back on the air 
news media were censored under the state of emergency law 
enacted in 1982 that law was revoked last january in compliance 
with the peace plan 
in an editorial monday la prensa said the sandinista regime 
imposes censorship restrictions on the broadcasters because it 
doesnt want freedom of expression 
the newspaper has said some of its reporters have been harassed 
by the sandinistas but the government has not clamped down on its 
editorial policy 
radio corporacion on tuesday quoted the head of the 
nongovernmental human rights commission lino hernandez as saying

president reagan refused to say tuesday 
whether he had approved the dropping of drug charges against 
panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega and defended embattled 
attorney general edwin meese saying his longtime friend would live 
under this cloud if he resigned 
reagan said he had complete confidence in meese whose 
justice department has been rocked by unrest and resignations and 
who is the target of criminal investigations of his affairs 
at a brief news conference the president also said i dont 
guide my life by astrology but he did not disavow believing in it 
reagan said no changes were ever made in his schedule because of 
astrological forecasts as former white house chief of staff donald 
t regan has claimed 
we made no decisions on it and were not binding our lives to 
this reagan said and i dont mean to offend anyone who does 
believe in it or engages in it seriously regan added 
asked if he believed in astrology reagan paused a long moment 
and said i dont guide my life by it but i wont answer the 
question the other way because i dont know enough about it to say 
is there something to it 
questions about noriega and meese dominated the nationally 
broadcast questionandanswer session in the white house briefing 
room it was his most extensive meeting with the press since a news 
conference feb 24 
there have been numerous reports that reagan has offered to drop 
drugtrafficking charges against noriega if he would leave panama 
at least until after elections are held 
we are in the midst of real negotiations i cant comment 
further on this reagan said repeatedly he said he would not 
reveal what the united states was offering noriega while the 
negotiations were continuing but promised to make a full 
statement to the public at the appropriate time 
however reagan said much of what has been written about the 
negotiations had been based on some kind of leaks or 
misinformation because there are no facts to sustain it 
in refusing to discuss the negotiations reagan said it would 
be foolish to do so some things you have to keep to yourself when 
youre arguing with someone else 
there has been no decision made on some of the things that are 
being discussed he added 
youre asking me to lead into whats being talked about and i 
can only tell you that were not going to whitewash anyone he 
said 
reagan also defended the administration against allegations that 
it knew long ago that noriega was involved in drug trafficking but 
chose to look the other way 
there had been some rumors but no one ever received or 
could get evidence to substantiate those rumors the president 
said 
the president gave a warm endorsement of meese his friend of 
more than 20 years who is under increasing pressure to resign 
i have complete confidence in him reagan said 
he said there has been a recent practice in which accusation 
or allegation is taken to mean conviction and theres been too 
much of that in this land of ours you are innocent until you are 
proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
embracing meeses rationale for remaining on the job reagan 
said i think that for him to step aside as he has said would 
be for him to live the rest of his life under this cloud where 
nothing had ever been proved 
he raised questions about meeses firing of terry eastland the 
justice department spokesman who has been defended by 
conservatives the president said there may be more than meets 
the eye he refused to elaborate telling reporters they should 
talk to the attorney general about that 
reagan opened his news conference with a statement hailing the 
agreement to start senate debate on the ussoviet 
intermediaterange arms treaty and the march trade figures which 
showed a dramatic drop in the monthly deficit in the balance of 
exports and imports 
he said the 41 billion drop in the trade deficit was good 
news the best news on this front since march of 1985 
he cited the figures as evidence that restrictive trade 
legislation recently passed by the democraticcontrolled congress 
was not needed he said he expected to veto the bill and send that 
message to congress in the next few days

an advertising agency that sent a photo of an 
african boy apparently kissing a cows rear to the head of a 
womens center is drawing new criticism for an ad depicting a 
female athlete with a bulge underneath her gym shorts 
its extremely demeaning to women said suzanne born member 
of the minneapolis civil rights commission which on monday branded 
the ad designed by the fallon mcelligott agency as sexist 
the commissions ruling came four months after the agency 
apologized to the same commission for racist and sexist remarks 
directed at the director of the womens center at mankato state 
university the agency lost a major account as a result of that 
controversy 
fred senn director of account services for the minneapolis 
agency said monday the ad attacks a serious problem its 
vulgar its hardhitting but youve got to scare these kids out 
of using that stuff he said 
the poster part of the university of minnesotas campaign 
against use of steroids by athletes shows a female wearing shorts 
with the caption steroids theyll make a man out of you yet 
the poster does not show male genitalia directly but shows a 
bulge as it were according to gail shore a public affairs 
officer for the womens athletic department 
many athletes take steroids to increase muscle bulk but can 
cause emotional and physical problems including kidney ailments 
the posters were produced for the mens athletic department and 
were withdrawn in january said mark banker an intern on the 
departments promotions and advertising staff 
baker said only five to 10 posters were actually sold before 
they were withdrawn following a complaint from the womens athletic 
department 
senn said the agency warned the mens department that the 
posters were potentially controversial but born asked why the 
womens department was not consulted from the beginning 
senn told the board on monday the agency has hired a consultant 
in an effort to to nurture sensitivity toward race and sex issues 
but some commissioners were skeptical 
it says to me that you really havent learned anything youre 
paying lip service but you just dont get it born said your 
agency continues to come up with sexist ad campaigns 
in january fallon mcelligott president pat fallon apologized to 
neala schleuning head of the mankato womens center for sending 
her a photo of an african boy apparently kissing the back end of a 
cow 
an accompanying letter suggested schleuning use her energies to 
rid the world of such barbaric rituals rather than criticizing the 
agency for negative stereotypes of women in its ads 
fallon mcelligott known as a hot and growing agency with 140 
million in billings was asked to withdraw from competition for 
future us west business as a result of that controversy the 
telecommunications company provided 8 million of the agencys 
annual billings 
a us west spokeswoman said at the time that the company had 
expressed its objections to the letters in the very strongest 
terms 
although the city civil rights commission vote carries no direct 
consequences chair ophelia bancos said we just wanted them to 
be aware that they we are unhappy with what they are doing the 
only thing we can do is ask them to change their ads

democratic members of congress on tuesday 
questioned the effectiveness of the reagan administrations efforts 
to increase hiring and promotion of minorities at broadcast 
stations and cable television systems 
but dennis r patrick chairman of the federal communications 
commission and clarence thomas chairman of the equal employment 
opportunity commission said democrats in congress could contribute 
to minority gains by confirming president reagans nomination of 
bradley holmes to the fcc 
this appears to have been derailed at the highest levels 
thomas told members of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
referring to the nomination of holmes a black who heads the fccs 
policy and rules division of the mass media bureau 
reagan nominated holmes a 34yearold attorney and former aide 
to patrick last november but friction between the fcc and 
congressional democrats have led senate leaders to put off 
confirmation hearings for holmes and attorney susan wing also 
nominated by reagan to become a commissioner 
sen ernest f hollings dsc chairman of the senate commerce 
committee has said he opposes the holmes nomination hollings 
displeasure with the fcc stems from the agencys decision last 
august to abolish the fairness doctrine a policy that required 
broadcasters to air conflicting views of controversial issues 
patrick joined thomas in urging action on holmes nomination 
patrick also defended his agencys efforts to hire and promote 
women and minorities inside the agency and to encourage equal 
employment opportunities at radio and tv stations and cable systems 
in the broadcast and cable industries progress has been gradual 
but steady he said 
in radio and tv minority employment has risen from 99 percent 
overall and 84 percent in the top four job categories in 1972 to 
162 percent overall and 14 percent in the top jobs in 1987 he 
said 
women have increased their numbers during the period from 23 
percent overall and 97 percent in the top four job categories to 
378 percent overall and 299 percent in top jobs 
for cable fcc figures show minorities going from 117 percent 
overall and 102 percent in the top four job categories in 1978 to 
195 percent overall and 157 percent in the top jobs in 1987 
women went from 306 percent of cables overall workforce and 114 
percent in the top jobs in 1978 to 404 percent overall and 278 
percent in the top jobs last year 
rep edward j markey dmass subcommittee chairman disputed 
patricks claim that minority employment in the top broadcasting 
and cable jobs continues to improve and suggested the fccs 
enforcement of equal employment opportunity efforts is weak 
patrick conceded that in some specific job categories the 
percentage of minorities has been declining national cable 
television association figures show that while minorities in the 
top job category officials and managers grew from 88 percent in 
1984 to 96 percent in 1987 minorities in the second job category 
professionals declined from 155 percent to 123 percent during 
the period 
markey said his concern was that the people who decide what 
americans will view are in the top four job categories it is 
their view of america our culture our society that is 
presented he said to the extent that blacks are not fully 
represented gives us some concern

critical homestate lawmakers said tuesday that 
gov michael dukakis ignored repeated warnings of a state budget 
crisis because the signals came at key junctures of his 
presidential campaign 
however dukakis top budget officer said the governor had 
warned the legislature a year ago that the budget was based on 
revenue projections that might prove overly optimistic 
new state figures released monday showed the state was 243 
million short for the fiscal year that ends june 30 that would be 
166 million more than the shortfall projected by the governors 
revenue advisory board on april 12 a week before the new york 
primary and two weeks before the pennsylvania primary wins in 
those contests made it clear that dukakis was all but certain to be 
the democratic presidential nominee 
the 243 million shortfall is in addition to 233 million that 
the administration told state agencies not to spend after the money 
had been allocated 
house taxation committee chairman john flood a democrat said 
tuesday they will be rolling on across the potomac river while 
the ship of massachusetts goes down with the rest of us on it 
house republican leader steven pierce said potomac fever led 
the administration to ignore the warning signs 
i think when the governor signed this budget at the beginning 
of last july anyone who knew anything knew that it was out of 
balance said state republican party spokesman charlie manning 
yet this guy is running as a fiscal manager 
secretary of administration and finance frank keefe scoffed at 
the criticism pointing to budgetparing dukakis vetoes and to the 
legislatures rejection of a 255 million dukakisfiled tax 
enforcement and fee package 
im a little bit amused by folks who want to rewrite 
history keefe said it was the legislature that fully believed 
the future was going to be just like the immediate past which was 
a period of enormous good fortune 
keefe said dukakis had instructed him in september 1987 to put 
together contingency plans to cut 185 million in spending and he 
said the governor at several intervals since had told him to look 
for further cuts 
the administration privately considered the revenue advisory 
boards projected shortfall conservative but we werent about to 
say absolutely that things were horrible when we had no concrete 
evidence that that was the case keefe said

president reagan refused to disavow the 
practice of astrology on tuesday saying he did not know enough 
about it to say whether or not there is something to it 
but reagan also insisted that no changes were made in his 
schedule because of first lady nancy reagans dealings with an 
astrologer 
we made no decisions on it and were not binding our lives to 
this reagan told reporters in a short questionandanswer 
session in the white house briefing room 
the president then quickly added and i dont mean to offend 
anyone who does believe in it or engages in it seriously 
but asked if he believed in astrology the president paused 
before replying 
i dont guide my life by it but i wont answer the question 
the other way because i dont know enough about it to say is there 
something to it he then replied 
it was the most detailed response given by the president to the 
report that his wife used stargazing to help formulate his schedule 
and make decisions about other white house activities 
former white house chief of staff donald t regan revealed the 
practice in his book for the record and white house officials 
have confirmed that the first lady has an interest in following 
the stars 
reagan offered a sometimes rambling defense of his wifes 
activity saying that the experience of the march 30 1981 
assassination attempt contributed to her reliance on advice 
provided by a person whom he only identified as being a friend 
reagan said the friend called the first lady after the 
shooting and told her that it would have been helpful to have known 
what the president had planned to do that day because all the 
signs were bad 
that was a trauma that didnt g away easily reagan said 
in an apparent explanation of his wifes dealings with the 
astrologer he added and when suddenly things of the same kind 
just for a short period there when i was booked for something of 
the same kind where the accident occurred why she would ask what 
does it look like now and no changes were ever made on the basis 
of whether i did or did not conduct this 
the president was asked whether he believed that based upon a 
warning from an astrologer he could have changed what had happened 
no this friend thought that had i been told of that that 
was supposed to be a horrendous time for me that i might have done 
something well we didnt he replied 
while the reagans have never identified the astrologer san 
francisco heiress joan quigley has confirmed that she has spoken 
with the first couple on the subject miss quigley has authored 
several books on astrology 
asked if he had allowed astrology to be used in setting his 
schedule reagan responded it didnt go on and this whole thing 
is built around an incident in which it is printed that this had to 
do with scheduling of one of my operations well it didnt happen 
that way at all 
regan in his book relates a conversation he had with the first 
lady in which she spoke of a possible delay in the presidents july 
1985 colon cancer surgery the former chief of staff said he feared 
the first lady was speaking of a possible delay because she wanted 
to consult first with her astrologer 
nancy reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant 
powers of this woman regan wrote

medical records do not support a womans 
claim that the copper7 intrauterine device caused her infertility 
an attorney for the iuds manufacturer told a federal jury tuesday 
when the question is a medical one we must look to the 
medical records for the answer paul strain an attorne for gd 
searle amp co said in opening arguments 
a jury of five women and three men is hearing the civil suit 
against searle by esther kociemba 29 and her husband william of 
elk river 
michael ciresi an attorney for the kociembas said in his 
opening arguments that searle displayed corporate 
irresponsibility by withholding knowledge that its copper7 iud 
had the potential to cause infertility 
its a story of a company closing the door on the godgiven 
right of a woman to bear children ciresi said 
but strain said attorneys for mrs kociemba would be introducing 
evidence not central to the issues involved in the case 
this is a case about whether they the plaintiffs have met 
the burden of proving that the copper7 caused the infertility of 
mrs kociemba strain said 
the kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in 
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries mrs kociemba 
including infertility allegedly suffered as a result of using a 
copper7 iud for about 1 years in 1977 and 1978 
strain asked the jury for a fair and just decision i ask 
you to decide this case solely on the evidence you are not to 
decide this case on sympathy or any other bias strain said 
experts in obstetrics and gynecology will address other 
periods in mrs kociembas life and whether the infertility could 
have occurred before she started using the copper7 strain said 
mrs kociemba was 19 and single when she had the iud inserted 
she had it removed after she married but strain said there is no 
record that she was fertile before she started using the copper7 
ciresi meanwhile accused searle of covering up information 
that its iud was causing problems although the company received 
reports of problems the company hid that information from 
doctors in this country and the women in whom the devices were 
being inserted he said 
ciresis law firm robins zelle larson amp kaplan represented 
plaintiffs in many of cases involving ah robins cos dalkon 
shield which was eventually withdrawn from the market the firm is 
representing more than 30 women in copper7 lawsuits against searle 
while the kociemba case is the 18th involving the copper7 
nationwide to go to trial it is the first being tried by robins 
zelle which has said it will introduce internal searle documents 
never before presented 
the firm has said evidence introduced in the kociemba trial is 
expected to set a foundation for lawsuits to come

port authorities on tuesday 
refused for a second time to let a syrian ship enter the harbor 
with a cargo of toxic chemical waste that left marina di carrara 
more than a year ago 
the cargo of 2000 tons of waste has been transferred from ship 
to ship since it was first loaded aboard a freighter in this 
northern port in february 1987 
at one point after a transatlantic voyage the hazardous waste 
was unloaded in venezuela but officials there said a boy died after 
playing near some of the open drums and the government asked italy 
to take the cargo back 
francesco rizzuto an attorney for the syrian ships owner 
tobalo shipping said tuesday there are 12000 drums of 
unidentified chemicals aboard the zanoobia and leakage has made two 
of the 18 crew members seriously ill 
the zanoobia has been anchored off marina di carrara 60 miles 
southeast of genoa for three weeks 
since the waste was first loaded aboard the cypriotflagged 
freighter ljnx there have been efforts to dispose of the cargo in 
djibouti venezuela syria and greece 
rizzuto said the waste is jeopardizing the crew of the zanoobia

employees worked fast and furious 
tuesday to clean up a mediumsecurity prison while state agencies 
began investigating a 59hour weekend uprising 
prison officials offered counseling to eight guards taken 
hostage at the mack alford correctional center and prison 
spokeswoman anita trammell said the disturbance tightened bonds 
among the prisons 148 employees 
gov henry bellmon said he was assigning the investigation to 
the department of public safety even though the oklahoma state 
bureau of investigation had already begun its probe 
our problem with the osbis prison investigation is that it 
takes them so long said bellmon 
osbi spokesman paul renfrow said agents expect to interview 
about 100 people involved in the incident which began friday 
evening and ended monday morning when the last hostages were 
released unharmed 
state corrections director gary maynard said 40 inmates 
identified as being ringleaders or involved in the riot were being 
held in a disciplinary unit called the rock at a state prison 
in mcalester 
all of those will receive misconduct reports if found guilty 
of misconduct they will most likely receive 30 days in the 
disciplinary unit he said 
maynard said during the 30 days the inmates would receive no 
privileges with only one visit a month from family members and one 
hour a day of exercise during which they will wear handcuffs and 
leg irons 
their cases also will be submitted to the district attorney 
for review he said 
prison officials met tuesday with seven of the eight hostages 
and their families at the prison visitors center and marcus 
pogue health services administrator at the prison offered 
counseling to the families 
most of the prisons 653 prisoners have been transferred to 
other institutions and the staff is working fast and furious 
on a cleanup ms trammell said 
ms trammell said an early 5 million estimate on damage may be 
low but added it may be several days before authorities come up 
with another estimate 
state corrections officials said about 130 inmates remain at 
stringtown they said they did not know when the damaged portions 
of the prison would be ready for reoccupation

randy curtis is glad to hear that sioux 
city gateway airport no longer will be known as sux 
it was somewhat of a joke in the industry said curtis the 
airport manager 
the federal aviation administration announced monday it would 
change the airports threeletter identification which all 
airports have for airline directories identification on baggage 
tags and some radio frequencies 
curtis said he favors sui for sioux city iowa 
sen tom harkin diowa had asked the faa to change the code 
after complaints from residents and the airports advisory board 
the community of sioux city has been interested in having the 
designation changed to something more appropriate and less 
suggestive a spokeswoman for harkin said 
the request was submitted more than two years ago so the 
decision to nix sux came as sort of a surprise curtis said 
curtis said the airport has had the threeletter code for years 
it probably goes back quite a few years ago when the connotations 
were not like that he said

the senate opened debate on the ussoviet 
mediumrange missile treaty tuesday just over a week before 
president reagan leaves for the moscow summit 
not long after the debate opened reagan renewed his appeal for 
quick action on the pact saying it has placed ussoviet arms 
discussions on a path that goes beyond arms control and toward real 
nuclear arms reduction 
reagan entered the white house briefing room to say he is both 
hopeful and confident that after careful consideration the senate 
will agree that this treaty is a diplomatic milestone and give its 
consent to united states participation 
the white house wants the senate to act quickly enough to alow 
reagan to go to moscow with a ratified treaty senate majority 
leader robert c byrd dwva said he too hopes the president can 
take to the summit the treaty with a blue ribbon on it 
but there is no guarantee the senate will be able to act before 
reagan meets soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in the kremlin on 
may 29 the president is to leave washington next wednesday for a 
rest stop in finland before going on to moscow 
as debate opened tuesday afternoon byrd said the exhaustive 
scrutiny to which the accord has been subjected should prove a 
useful civics lesson to both the white house and kremlin that 
the senates role in the approval of treaties is not symbolic 
that it is not a rubber stamp that the senate will not just roll 
over and play dead 
its time to roll up our sleeves and go to work said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas theres no reason the 
president should not have the treaty to ratify in moscow 
when ronald reagan steps off air force one onto russian soil 
i want mr gorbachev to know that hes facing a man with the solid 
backing of congress and the american people dole said 
dole said the senate should aim at ratifying the treaty on next 
wednesday the day the president leaves on his moscow trip 
sen alan cranston dcalif urging approval of the pact said 
the treaty spells the beginning of the end of this mindless race 
to add ever more nuclear weapons 
but sen jesse helms rnc the treatys leading senate 
opponent repeated a litany of complaints about the treaty and 
said the reagan administration is promoting the pact with snake 
oil claims 
helms complained that the treaty requires only the destruction 
of missiles not their nuclear warheads 
the official us claim is that this treaty removes from 
europe an entire class of nuclear weapons helms said and added 
there is an old song called it aint necessarily so 
i have a hunch that if ronald reagan were running for 
president this year instead of being in his last year in office he 
would be out on the hustings demanding the senate reject this 
treaty helms contended 
vote counts show that helms is badly outnumbered in his 
opposition to the treaty and that it is likely to be ratified by 
far more than the required 67 votes twothirds of the senate if 
all 100 members are present and voting 
but helms said the odds make no difference to him 
i am going to vote against ratification even if i am the only 
senator to do so he said 
sen claiborne pell dri the chairman of the foreign 
relations committee said the treaty has only small military 
significance because it eliminates only about 5 percent of the 
missiles in the two superpowers nuclear arsenals 
its importance he said is because it represents a small but 
vitally important step towards more substantial arms 
reduction pell said it is of immense psychological and 
political importance 
pell said the terms of the pact strongly favor the united 
states however because it requires the destruction of missiles 
capable of carrying four times as many nuclear warheads than the 
us missiles which are to be eliminated 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty requires the 
destruction of all groundlaunched mediumrange missiles with a 
range of between 300 miles and 3400 miles 
the groundbreaking arms control pact has been under 
consideration by three senate committees since the beginning of the 
year but senate debate on ratifying it was delayed by lastminute 
problems 
byrd announced monday that all roadblocks had been cleared by an 
agreement reached in geneva last week between secretary of state 
george p shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
byrd said the senates foreign relations intelligence and armed 
services committees were satisfied that the agreement had resolved 
misunderstandings over the implementation of the treatys onsite 
inspection provisions 
additionally the committees said shultz had succeeded in 
winning soviet agreement to endorse the us position that the 
treaty bans all mediumrange weapons including those using 
futuristic technology such as laser rays particle beams and 
highpower microwaves 
i feel that it is a good treaty much better than it was when 
it was first sent to the hill byrd told the senate on tuesday 
that is a tribute both to the senate and to the 
administration he said praising the three committees which he 
said insisted there were loose ends that needed to be tied 
i hope the treaty will be approved will be ratified and it 
is not unreasonable to hope that it will be done before the 
president leaves for the summit byrd said that will be our 
main goal delay for the sake of delay is certainly not one of the 
approaches i would embrace

undocumented aliens are still pouring into 
the united states despite a new immigration law making it illegal 
for employers to hire them officials said tuesday after finding 42 
people hidden in a northbound freight train 
juan garcia assistant chief with the border patrols mcallen 
sector said the numbers have been increasing lately and agents 
who stopped the train tuesday had been expecting to find even more 
aliens in the trains 113 cars 
this is an extremely low count said ba french a 
supervisory patrol agent with the border patrols harlingen station 
in the lower rio grande valley 
a recent fiveday sweep of trains netted more than 100 aliens 
per day french said including a group suffering from dehydration 
in a sealed boxcar 
among those apprehended tuesday were several families and two 
small children huddled in a grain hopper car the mexicans appeared 
stunned as they climbed down a ladder while a border patrol 
helicopter circled overhead shining a spotlight on the predawn 
scene 
i came to find work wherever it the train stops tomas 
vega 21 of san luis potosi mexico said while another man from 
the same city carried a crying 3yearold boy 
during the first week of may the border patrols mcallen sector 
reported 1691 apprehensions of undocumented aliens last week the 
sector reported 1080 apprehensions 204 involving people from 
countries other than mexico said fred rangel a border patrol 
agent in mcallen 
rangel said the number of aliens has dropped since the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 was passed but the 
total is higher than a year ago 
patrol agent michael obarr with the laredo sector northwest of 
here said the situation is the same in his area 
overall were seeing slightly above what we were last year 
obarr said the new laws had its impact but still people are 
willing to take a chance unfortunately we have those employers 
who are willing to hire them 
recently many undocumented aliens who have been in the united 
states for five years were able to register for legal status but 
that process ended may 4 and did not apply to new arrivls 
the new immigration law also makes it illegal to hire 
undocumented aliens and employer sanctions under the new law go 
into full effect june 1 but aliens keep coming because of the 
desperate economic situation in mexico obarr said 
were still catching 500 or 600 a day said doug mosier 
with the border patrols el paso sector in western texas and new 
mexico 
he said apprehensions are about 30 percent below the rate in 
1986 when the sector made 312000 alien arrests 
the situation in mexico is terrible and people are caught in 
a situation where their country has nothing to offer them said 
telma longoria director for catholic social services in the 
brownsville diocese 
she said the diocese is seeing more central americans than ever 
at its shelter east of brownsville which averages 150200 aliens 
at any given time primarily from el salvador nicaragua guatemala 
and honduras 
the people are coming ms longoria said there is no 
doubt about that we see it all the time 
with the weather heating up officials said they are checking 
trains more often to prevent a repeat of last years tragedy in 
sierra blanca texas when 18 aliens suffocated in a sealed 
sweltering boxcar 
the smugglers dont care about the aliens that much said 
travis johnson who is in charge of the harlingen station they 
want their money

the chairman of the house banking committee 
after being rebuffed by federal regulators said tuesday he will 
proceed with legislation abolishing a muchcriticized agency set up 
to handle property from insolvent savings institutions 
rep fernand j st germain dri in a statement prepared for 
the house floor said he was not suprised by the federal home loan 
bank boards decision to defend the federal asset disposition 
association to its final hour 
st germain in a letter may 3 had asked bank board chairman m 
danny wall to dissolve fada a quasipublic agency created by the 
bank board three years ago 
st germain has accused fada of favoritism conflicts of interest 
and mismanagement of the 42 billion in loans and real estate in 
its care 
wall replied in a letter friday that st germains criticisms 
are historical in nature 
the facts about fada under its new management are markedly 
different wall said referring to gerald p carmen the former 
director of the general services administration who took over as 
fada chief executive in february 
wall said staff reductions ordered by carmen will save 2 
million a year he argued that abolishing fada would at a minimum 
cost millions of dollars create confusion and destroy the 
value to the system already created 
i am confident that in the coming months you will see how 
sound the concept of fada is and how much good will have come from 
its new management wall told st germain 
however st germain noting his threat in the may 3 letter to 
push legislation abolishing fada said we will proceed on that 
course 
washington boondoggles have a life of their own and unless 
they are nipped in the bud they become part of the landscape 
forevermore st germain said fada is at just such a 
crossroads 
reps paul kanjorski dpa and tom mcmillen dmd on 
wednesday planned to introduce legislation to dismantle fada within 
60 days and return its functions to the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp the government insurance fund backing sampl deposits 
up to 100000

wr grace amp co used 21 million in federal 
funds earmarked for kidney patients to finance acquisition of the 
nations largest kidney dialysis company the philadelphia inquirer 
reported tuesday 
a federal audit concluded that the use of the money was 
improper the newspaper said 
in the same year 1984 in which graces chairman j peter 
grace headed a presidents commission to investigate waste fraud 
and fiscal abuse his company took control of the dialysis company 
national medical care 
wr grace in a statement read by spokesman frederick bona in 
new york said the inquirer article contained many inaccuracies 
and showed a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that 
determine the dialysis remimbursement rate 
the newspaper said that in 1985 a dialysis clinc in puerto rico 
owned by the grace subsidiary made a 1 million profit it said a 
federal program paid the clinic 25 million to treat about 140 
patients while a government audit showed the treatments cost 15 
million 
more than 500000 was profit for the clinic the newspaper 
said and the remaining 500000 paid nonpatient expenses and 
physicians salaries that federal auditors deemed excessive 
dialysis which keeps kidneydisease patients alive costs about 
20000 a year 
congress moved 16 years ago to ensure that dialysis was 
available to everyone it launched a program that this year will 
pay 25 billion to 1665 clinics 
federal records show that many clinics are making profits 
approaching 30 percent from the average 125 per treatment paid by 
the government the inquirer said 
federal officials acknowledge that they have little idea of how 
the clinics spend the money they receive through medicare 
we dont ask questions about how they parcel out that amount 
of money said bernadette shoemaker director of the division of 
dialysis and transplant policy for the governments health care 
financing administration 
we pay the rate its up to the facilities to divvy up the 
amount 
the inquirer said that the spending of the money is largely 
uncontrolled and feeds a tremendously profitable industry 
wr grace amp co a giant conglomerate that owns chemical 
companies and restaurants obtained nmc according to the inquirer 
through a 350 million buyout of shareholders but the new company 
borrowed about 2904 million to complete the deal the newspaper 
said 
according to the audit nmc paid about 35 million in interest 
in 1985 on the money borrowed from the stock buyout and labeled a 
portion of that interest as a cost of patient care 
edmund g lowrie senior vice president of nmc estimated in an 
interview last week that about 60 percent or about 21 million of 
that 35 million payment was charged to the federally funded clinic 
the root cause of this is the denial of government to 
acknowledge that a return on invested capital is an allowable 
cost lowrie said 
larry simmons deputy assistant inspector general for health 
audits in the department of health and human services said there 
was no finding of illegality in the audit 
how they spend their money is not really a concern of the 
government simmons said when that money hits nmc its their 
money 
in its statement grace said that since federal dialysis 
payments began in 1973 the reimbursement rate dropped 10 percent 
from about 138 per treatment to about 125 per treatment today 
while healthcare costs rose by more than 200 percent 
nmc received no more money as a result of the sale of the 
business than if they didnt sell it bona said whatever the 
costs are thats up to the provider 
graces statement also said that in 1983 nmcs last full year 
as a publicly traded company net income was 23 million compared 
with 84 million in 1985 nmcs first full year after the 
acquisition 
this drop is accounted 100 percent by the increased interest 
expense associated with the acquisition and therefore was borne 
by the current nmc shareholders graces statement said

a possible us requirement that all of canadas 
10 provinces approve the uscanada free trade agreement put the 
government on the defensive tuesday ontarios premier said the 
pact is dead if it depends on him 
on monday the us senate finance committee won the reagan 
administrations support for the condition lloyd bentsen a texas 
democrat is chairman of the committee 
the free trade agreement was prime minister brian mulroneys 
initiative and he has assured washington his conservative 
government has the power to implement it 
his problem is that the governments of ontario and prince edward 
island oppose the agreement which was signed jan 2 and is to 
become effective jan 1 1989 if approved by congress and 
parliament 
four other provinces have told the federal government not to use 
the measure to intrude on areas of provincial jurisdiction 
the trade deal which took 18 months to negotiate would be 
undermined without the participation of ontario canadas 
industrial powerhouse 
ontario premier david peterson said tuesday the deal is finished 
if it depends on his formal approval 
if you ask me to sign a piece of paper saying that i agree 
with it the answer is no he told reporters if that in fact 
stops the deal then the deal will stop i am not prepared to 
implement anything we dont like 
peterson said the agreement gives the united states too much 
influence over canadian policies on energy agriculture and service 
industries without protecting canada from us countervailing and 
antidumping duties 
the federal government has the power to make international trade 
agreements but peterson a liberal threatened court action if it 
tries to impose changes in areas traditionally under provincial 
jurisdiction such as marketing rules for wine and liquor 
under the free trade pact canada must end discriminatory 
markups on us wine and liquor products jan 1 
peterson who wants to protect vineyards in the niagara region 
has said he will make changes only over a sevenyear period he 
also threatens to fight federal intervention in ontarios service 
and energy industries 
both main opposition parties the liberals and new democrats 
oppose the free trade accord and have said they will scrap it if 
they win the next parliamentary election expected either this fall 
or next spring 
after learning of the senate committee condition liberal party 
leader john turner said mulroneys government is letting a 
foreign country dictate how we should operate 
canada and the united states are the worlds biggest trading 
partners and about 80 percent of the trade already is dutyfree 
the free trade agreement would eliminate all remaining duties over 
a 10year period and relax investment restrictions and other 
nontariff barriers

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev may withdraw 50000 to 
100000 troops from europe this year to kick off a new round of 
eastwest negotiations on conventional forces a us official said 
tuesday 
a unilateral soviet pullback would have little impact 
strategically said a us official but the political effect 
could be major in europe where polls show high regard for 
gorbachev on arms control issues 
the official said 50000 to 70000 soviet troops might be 
withdrawn another us official said as many as 100000 red army 
troops could be pulled back within soviet borders from positions in 
east europe 
while the two officials spoke on condition of anonymity former 
defense secretary harold brown predicted that gorbachev might try 
to throw reagan off balance at the moscow summit may 29june 2 by 
announcing a unilateral withdrawal 
brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the soviets 
move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front 
the withdrawals could come from among the estimated 380000 
soviet troops kept at a high state of readiness in east germany 
us officials trying to anticipate gorbachevs summit strategy 
also have detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summit 
meeting before reagan leaves office in eight months the projected 
sites are vienna or budapest 
another summit would give the two sides more time to work on a 
treaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 percent 
to 50 percent reagan had hoped to make the treaty the centerpiece 
of his visit to moscow but negotiators are stymied over the us 
star wars antimissile program and means to verify compliance with 
the pact 
secretary of state george p shultz acknowledged after making 
final summit preparations last week in geneva with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze that it is now clear there is no 
way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the 
summit 
the two sides have agreed on a confidencebuilding measure 
that was negotiated as part of the treaty but which reagan and 
gorbachev are likely to sign during the summit as a separate deal 
another us official said 
it provides for advance notification of all us and soviet 
missile test launchings including those from submarines as well 
as the approximate target location 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
proposal for the summit signing was made by defense secretary frank 
c carlucci and accepted by soviet defense minister dimitri yazov 
because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit us 
officials foresee it as an event to consolidate improvements in 
us soviet relations since gorbachev took office in 1985 and began 
the summit meetings 
at the same time us officials were preparing for possible 
surprises 
at reykjavik in 1986 gorbachev seized the initiative with 
sweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons 
this time us officials said gorbachev may propose reducing 
ground forces in europe by 25 percent and opening negotiations in 
vienna in late fall 
the united states and its 15 north atlantic treaty organization 
allies have balked at new talks on conventional arms until the 
soviets fulfill the human rights pledges they made in the 1975 
helsinki accord 
senior us officials said shevardnadze told shultz there soon 
would be some practical moves by moscow in the area of religious 
practices and religious education he did not offer any details 
but his statement was taken seriously by the us side 
the conventional force negotiations between nato and the 
sevennation warsaw pact would supersede to mutual and balanced 
force reduction talks that began in 1973 but failed to produce an 
agreement on cutting troops on the central european front 
reagan administration officials are hopeful now because 
gorbachev seems to have accepted the principle of the wests 
argument that asymmetry the geographic and possible numerical 
advantages of the warsaw pact must be addressed in negotiations 
the soviets can afford to take significant cuts without 
hurting their military capability the us official said the 
first us objective is to get the soviets down to nato levels 
pentagon and other estimates of nato and warsaw pact troop 
strengths vary widely from a 900000man edge for the east to a 
200000 western edge 
where the warsaw pact has a decided lead is in tanks and 
artillery the pentagon estimates the sovietled alliance has 
52000 tanks compared with 20000 in nato and 43000 artillery 
pieces compared with natos 18000

attorney general edwin meese iii said tuesday 
he fired chief spokesman terry eastland because it was time for a 
change in leadership and that the dismissal did not revolve 
around a question of aggressively defending meese 
meese made the comment to reporters after president reagan 
reiterated his confidence in meese and said in reference to 
eastlands firing that there is more than meets the eye with 
regard to this latest departure 
meese said i suspect what reagan had in mind concerning 
eastlands departure was that i determined it was time for a 
change in leadership rather than all this big blowup in the 
paper about this reason or that reason 
eastland meeses public affairs chief since april 1985 said in 
a letter monday that the attorney general had told him friday he 
wanted someone willing to aggressively defend you against any 
and all criticism he said meese had concluded my efforts have 
not sufficed 
meese flatly contradicted that portion of eastlands letter late 
monday afternoon telling reporters that eastlands departure had 
nothing to do with a defense of me actually defending me 
was not one of terrys tasks 
meese said the task of defending him was being handled by his 
personal lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap they are 
representing the attorney general in a yearold criminal 
investigation being conducted by independent counsel james mckay 
meanwhile eastlands special assistant ronald tomalis 
resigned tomalis was asked to remain at the justice department but 
handed in his resignation and plans to leave the department in two 
weeks said patrick korten who is eastlands replacement 
tomalis declined to comment on his reasons for leaving but it 
is customary for aides to departing political appointees to leave 
as well 
in addition meese announced that deborah burstionwade is the 
new deputy director in the public affairs office succeeding korten 
burstionwade joined the justice departments public affairs 
office in october 1986 after working as a spokeswoman for the us 
civil rights commission 
on another matter the manager of a public relations firm said 
tuesday he has spoken to meese about a possible contract to examine 
the justice departments public portrayal of its war on drugs 
charles crawford who manages the washington office of hill amp 
knowlton said i discussed with the attorney general the whole 
veracity of the process in publicizing the departments drug 
enforcement efforts 
crawford said there was concern that drug enforcement programs 
were being lost in the background of other issues and said i 
suppose the other issues include meeses current legal troubles 
he said no contract had been drawn up meese and hill amp knowlton 
chairman robert t gray are friends 
the justice departments public affairs office has a 17 
million annual budget the fbi drug enforcement administration and 
other department agencies have their own public relations 
operations

pope john paul ii on tuesday denounced 
the exploitation of latin americas peasant farmers telling 
hundreds of thousands of campesinos not to be resigned to 
poverty 
although it is true this fertile land that god has given 
rewards your efforts abundantly how many times do those who do the 
work fail to reap the benefits the pope declared at a mass in 
villarrica a farm center 100 miles southeast of asuncion 
heavy rains disrupted the popes itinerary on the next to last 
day of his fournation south american visit 
after the mass john paul flew to mariscal estigarribia 335 
miles northwest of asuncion and spoke to about 5000 indians 
representing 16 tribes from paraguay and areas of neighboring 
argentina brazil and bolivia 
above all you want to be respected as persons and want your 
rights both human and civil to be recognized and protected he 
told the crowd gathered at the santa teresita mission 
he urged the indians not to abandon yourselves to despair 
and said the church has defended the freedom and dignity of 
native people in south america since the 16th century 
the pontiffs last event of the day was a controversial meeting 
with civic leaders including opposition politicians in asuncion 
the meeting with the churchsponsored builders of society 
was abruptly canceled by the government of gen alfredo stroessner 
last week the government dropped its ban after the vatican 
protested publicly 
about 300000 to 400000 people stood in ankledeep water on a 
field in villarrica and burst into applause and song when john paul 
arrived by car from asuncion instead of by plane as planned 
officials said the rains made it impossible to land on the dirt 
airstrip 
paraguays authoritarian government has harshly repressed 
attempts by peasant farmers to organize the roman catholic church 
has given some support to those efforts and 19 foreign 
missionaries have been expelled in the last 20 years 
police monday briefly detained two leaders of the peasants 
rights movement who were arrested along with an american priest 
and an union activist all were freed without explanation 
addressing the crowd john paul said living a christian life 
does not mean simply accepting with resignation the difficulties 
that you encounter 
john paul cited lack of adequate social benefit for farmers 
intransigence regarding salaries and unfair contracts and 
difficulty in obtaining property as some of the modern thorns 
and thistles that increase the already difficult conditions of your 
work 
questions of trade and pricing on the national and international 
levels have added to their difficulties he said 
the pontiff speaking from under a thatched canopy switched 
several times from spanish to guarani the indian language spoken 
widely by farmers in this landlocked country of 38 million people 
the pope began the day with an hourlong meeting with more than 
1000 priests nuns and seminarians in the national cathedral in 
asuncion 
he told them they must give preference in their ministry to the 
poor who in paraguay as in so many parts of latin america 
suffer every kind of privation 
so many peasants laborers workers without employment or 
being exploited lack their badly needed bread he said 
peasants who were occupying a church in paraguays capital ended 
a hunger strike and prayer service tuesday a spokesman said they 
accomplished their goal of bringing their plight to the attention 
of the public as well as the local church and vatican

the rev charles curran whose views on sex 
caused the vatican to bar him from teaching moral theology at 
catholic university charged tuesday that the school broke its 
contract by refusing to offer him another acceptable teaching 
assignment 
the board of trustees at catholic university is not willing to 
offer me a position in my area of competence with no strings 
attached curran told reporters i was willing to make a 
tremendous amount of concessions unfortunately they were not 
willing to accept them 
catholics board of trustees stripped curran of his canonical 
mission on april 12 prohibiting him from teaching in the 
department of theology because his lectures on homosexuality 
abortion and other issues of sexual morality differed from the 
vaticans position 
but the trustees retained his right as a tenured professor to 
teach in another area 
a faculty committee had gone along with the trustees as long as 
curran a member of the theology department for more than 20 years 
be offered a position acceptable to him before his canonical 
mission was revoked 
curran said negotiations with the oard this spring led him to 
believe he would be allowed to teach christian social ethics in the 
sociology department as long as he avoided issues of sexuality and 
human reproduction 
curran said he was willing to accept such an arrangement 
provided the position was truly in the area of my competence 
that i had access to students interested in this area and that i 
was in no other way worse off that i had been in the department of 
theology 
but he said the trustees have now stipulated that students in 
the departments of theology and canon law and the school of 
philosophy cannot take currans courses for credit and his courses 
cannot be required to satisfy core requirements of the department 
of religion and religious education 
they were going to put me over there and isolate me from every 
student curran said he demanded his classes be open to all 
students 
the university also required that curran promise in writing he 
would not teach catholic theology 
a breach by professor curran of this provision shall 
constitute adequate cause for his dismissal from the university 
the proposed agreement said 
i just cannot sign a statement that says i wont teach 
catholic theology at catholic university curran said thats 
who i am it would be untrue 
basically this is constructive termination he said 
catholic university president william j byron said in a 
statement the university has been attempting to arrive at a 
solution that is faithful to the holy sees judgment that father

soviet soldiers heading home tuesday 
in a 300vehicle convoy faced the most dangerous stretch of their 
threeday journey a guerrillainfested gorge north of kabul 
the soviet news agency tass reported that residents of the 
soviet border city of termez had decorated the streets with 
streamers and flags and were preparing a meal for the soldiers 
correspondents traveling with the soviet column leaving 
afghanistan were unable to report on developments after leaving 
kabul but they were told before departure monday that the most 
perilous portion of the journey north would be through the gorge 
and the salang tunnel in the hindu kush mountains 
most of the 1300 soviet troops in the convoy pulled out of a 
base in jalalabad near the border with pakistan early sunday and 
spent the day wending their way along the 88mile rutted route to 
the capital 
they set off for the soviet border after a ceremony conducted by 
afghan president najib officers said the journey would take about 
three days 
we feel more sure that everything will be ok now one 
soldier said above the din of revving tank engines referring to 
the 250mile trip north 
but others indicated the convoy would be lucky to escape the 
journey without casualties 
the soviet television news program vremya showed a series of 
reports tuesday night from afghanistan 
in the first a soviet correspondent reported from an armored 
vehicle while rifle fire rang out in the background he said he was 
on the road with the soviet forces withdrawing from afghanistan 
but did not say exactly where or comment on the shooting 
a second report said rebels had hit jalalabad with six rockets 
since the soviets began pulling out it showed pictures of dead and 
wounded afghans but did not say if the casualties were in 
jalalabad 
gunshots could be heard in the mountains towering over the 
jalalabadkabul route on sunday and a pool reporter riding with 
the convoy said the travelers felt especially vulnerable on low 
ground between mountains from which the anticommunist guerrillas 
can take aim 
information about the soviet withdrawal has been relayed from 
kabul by a reuters news agency pool report the associated press 
was denied permission to travel to afghanistan for the pullout and 
a soviet foreign ministry official said the exclusion was the 
result of inappropriate questions asked during a previous visit 
by ap 
tass said in a dispatch from termez located in the soviet 
republic of uzbekistan that city streets and squares are decked 
out with streamers with words of welcome for the 
soldiersinternationalists who have courageously fulfilled their 
duty 
a meal of mutton vegetables and pilaf would be waiting for the 
soldiers it said 
we have the great honor to be the first to welcome to the 
soviet land the soldiers who have fulfilled their internationalist 
duty in afghanistan city communist party leader tamara 
dzhurayeva told tass 
tass reported from kabul that afghan officials on monday 
presented a note to un observers monitoring the pullout alleging 
that pakistan was violating conditions of the april 14 agreement 
that set out conditions for the soviet withdrawal tass said no 
details of the note were made public 
under the geneva accord pakistan is to stop aiding the 
insurgents 
pakistani foreign minister zain noorani in moscow on an 
official visit met with deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov on 
tuesday and the conversation focused on afghanistan tass said 
tass said noorani was told by soviet officials that in 
presentday conditions there are better prospects for improving 
sovietpakistani relations apparently referring to the afghan 
peace accord 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a 
news briefing tuesday that the start of the pullout was a strong 
impulse toward success of najibs policy of national 
reconciliation a plan laid out two years ago that proposes to 
share power with other political groups 
gerasimov said the withdrawal refutes accusations that the 
soviets were seeking to conquer the neighboring country with the 
hope of obtaining a warm sea port he also dismissed speculation 
that the soviets were planning to divide afghanistan with najibs 
government holding the resourcerich northern areas adjacent to the 
soviet union

the town council demoted a police 
lieutenant and cut his pay by 1683 because he complained about 
the towns racist attitudes the town police chief said tuesday 
but town manager dana whitman jr said the demotion was needed 
to eliminate an unnecessary position and was not in retaliation for 
complaints by lt john c herbst 
i dont care what way its masked and what way its put 
forth its retaliatory countered police chief philip h 
schnabel 
herbsts complaint of pervasive racism more than a year ago 
led to an investigation by the state commission on human rights and 
opportunities the commission issued a report in january that 
substantiated herbsts claims and recommended changes in town 
policy to eliminate racism 
in addition to the demotion and pay cut herbst will be forced 
to work a rotating shift on nights and weekends he currently works 
daytime hours and no weekends 
its really upsetting herbst said tuesday he declined 
further comment on the town councils action but his attorney said 
a lawsuit would be filed as soon as possible in federal court 
theres simply no question this is punishment for blowing the 
whistle on racism in the police department said john williams 
representing herbst the people who did this are going to have to 
pay for it theyve aligned themselves with the racism cancer in 
that town 
william olds executive director of the connecticut civil 
liberties union said the organization would discuss the case later 
this week at a meeting 
rocky hill a welltodo hartford suburb of about 16000 
residents including about 330 blacks has 28 police officers 
herbst complained that racial jokes and slurs were common at 
town hall and tolerated by town officials he also said some police 
officers were in the habit of making stops based on a suspects 
race 
whitman termed herbsts demotion as a reduction in force 
which is allowed under the towns contract with the local police 
union he said when council members decided to eliminate one of the 
departments three lieutenant positions they had no idea herbst 
would be the officer affected 
herbst and the other lieutenants all achieved their rank the 
same day in 1982 herbst the departments administrative 
assistant was considered the senior lieutnenant since that time 
because he had the highest score on the lieutenants test 
but the town council decided seniority should be based on the 
length of employment leaving herbst with the least seniority 
herbst was hired in 1976 
whitman also said the idea for cutting a lieutenants position 
came up at a budget meeting last month he said the chief told 
town leaders that the duties performed by herbst duplicated those 
handled by deputy chief robert riley 
schnabel agreed that the job description for riley and herbst 
are similar but complained that the council was forcing him to 
choose between the two men riley said that his job and herbsts 
are not in fact similar

dangerous bacteria during world war ii experiments was declared 
safe after a government cleanup the defense ministry said tuesday 
the 520acre island of gruinard will be offered to the original 
owner a family trust for 930 the price paid by the government 
when it took it over in 1941 the ministry said in its annual paper 
on the defense budget

scottish highlands to test bombs containing anthrax bacteria in the 
belief that nazi germany was doing something similar the bacteria 
can be fatal to humans

states which began making anthrax bombs 
in 1979 government tests showed only 10 acres were still 
contaminated

would be no way for any other country to do the same through the 
waterway

charters in an attempt to halt the oil exports with which it 
finances the war iraq sends most of its oil abroad by pipeine

quoted by tehran radio as saying the best prayer for reagan and 
hussein would be to wish them to die because the more they 
stay alive the worse their situation will become

the governmentrun 
broadcasting network assailed the prosanctions position of 
archbishop desmond tutu on tuesday and challenged the anglican 
church to say if it supports or rejects tutus stance 
tutu the first black to head the anglican church in south 
africa was completing a us tour where he appealed for additional 
us economic sanctions to protest south africas apartheid 
policies 
archbishop tutu has never been voted into a public office that 
gives him the right to claim a significant constituency the 
south african broadcasting corp said in a commentary 
the statement failed to note that tutu like all of the nations 
26 million blacks is ineligible to vote or be elected to national 
political office 
the sabc also said without elaborating that the anglican 
church is deeply divided as a result of his tutus political 
utterances 
what is the churchs stand on the widely held view that 
sanctions will bring deprivation and hardship in increasing numbers 
to black south africans the sabc asked 
the church owes it not only to parishoners but to all south 
africans to state unequivocally where the church stands on 
sanctions disinvestments and their consequences 
anglican church officials could not be reached for comment 
despite repeated telephone calls to their offices 
the government has attacked tutu in harsh tones on a number of 
issues in march president pw botha sent a letter to tutu and 
other church leaders saying they love and embrace the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla group 
you embrace and participate in their call for violence 
hatred sanctions insurrection and revolution botha said 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize has continued to 
call for sanctions and other forms of international pressure as the 
most likely ways to bring about race reform in south africa 
the us congress imposed limited sanctions against south africa 
in 1986 banning the import of selected goods and stopping direct 
air links between the two countries congress now is considering 
much tougher legislation that would ban almost all bilateral 
economic activity 
under apartheid a racially segregated society is established by 
law and custom with the 5 million whites controlling the economy 
and maintaining separate districts schools and health services

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that 
a psychiatric hospitals officials could be sued in connection with 
the 1985 rape and murder of one hospital patient by another 
in two 30 decisions the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
rejected attempts by napa state hospital officials to dismiss suits 
filed by the victims estate and her psychiatrist 
the court said the victim marilyn conners was lured from her 
ward to a remote part of the hospital grounds by john duncan who 
raped and strangled her 
duncan had been admitted to the hospital after entering an 
insanity plea to a separate charge of rape and murder he also had 
tried to rape another female patient about two weeks before his 
attack on ms conners but still was allowed to roam the hospital 
grounds the court said 
duncan later pleaded no contest to seconddegree murder and 
assault with intent to commit rape of ms conners 
ms conners heirs sued five hospital administrators claiming 
gross negligence and reckless indifference to patient safety in 
allowing patients hospitalized on criminal charges to walk around 
the grounds 
dr william schwartzman a staff psychiatrist who treated ms 
conners sued two administrators after he was fired in 1985 
following disputes with management over the previous three years 
he claimed his dismissal was motivated partly by his public 
criticism of the hospital for allegedly administering too many 
drugs providing unsafe working conditions and inadequately 
supervising duncan 
tuesdays rulings upheld earlier decisions by two federal judges 
who refused to dismiss the suits 
although government officials have some protection from 
lawsuits the immunity does not apply to violations of clearly 
established rights said the opinions written by judge alfred 
goodwin he said the suits would meet that test if plaintiffs can 
prove that hospital officials were indifferent to patient safety 
and that schwartzman was fired because of his criticism

interior secretary donald p hodel rejected 
the advice of an advisory committee tuesday and declared a national 
historic landmark the maryland farm where whittaker chambers hid 
the pumpkin papers that convicted alger hiss 
chambers was a figure of transcendent importance in the 
nations history hodel said in a speech to the heritage 
foundation a conservative group 
hodel a staunch conservative who like many in the modern 
conservative movement acknowledges an intellectual and 
philosophical debt to chambers himself nominated pipe creek farm 
in westminster md for landmark status 
westminster is about 30 miles northwest of baltimore the farm 
is operated by chambers son john 
he was supported by the staff of the national park service 
which administers the landmark program 
william penn mott director of the service wrote hodel that the 
staff concluded that whittaker chambers was exceptionally 
significant and that the farm represents that significance with the 
requisite degree of historical integrity 
both the maryland state historic preservation office and a 
professional review committee including outside historians 
supported the designation but the advisory board of the national 
park service on april 26 opposed it 
the board cited the service guideline that 50 years should 
elapse before designation of landmarks to give historians time for 
an objective assessment 
i appreciate that the board disagrees but i do not chose to 
follow its advice in this instance said hodel 
the chairman of the advisory panel daniel jordan was 
philosophical about the secretarys rejection of its advice 
im surprised and disappointed i felt the advisory board had 
met its obligation in a serious manner and had made the correct 
decision said jordan who is head of the thomas jefferson 
memorial foundation in charlottesville va in a statement relayed 
by an aide 
but i also recognize that the board is responsible only for 
making a recommendation and that the final decision always rests 
with the secretary of the interior 
bruce craig cultural resources specialist for the national 
parks and conservation association a private group that lobbies 
for policies to benefit the parks said interior secretaries had 
disregarded the 50year rule before but it was the first time in 
memory that one had overruled the advisory board 
hodels disregard of the 50year rule constitutes a threat to 
the preservation program insofar as it represents a politicization 
of the program craig said 
it was 40 years ago that chambers then an editor at time 
magazine accused hiss a former state department official who had 
been secretary of the founding conference of the united nations of 
being a fellow member of a communist spy ring in the late 1930s 
at first not many people believed chambers a rumpled figure 
with bad teeth who looked seedy in comparison with the patrician 
harvardeducated hiss then head of the carnegie endowment for 
international peace

an administrative law judge ruled tuesday 
american telephone amp telegraph co was treated unfairly by the 
general services administration and awarded atampt four 
telecommunications contracts previously won by regional bell 
telephone companies 
however judge vincent labella ruling for the gsas board of 
contract appeals found that bias against atampt was not pervasive 
and refused to award the company three other contracts it sought 
atampt had appealed the contract awards charging that gsa 
discriminated against the longdistance leader in favor of the 
regional bell companies in its evaluation of atampts bid and by 
leaking secret information about the bid to its competitors 
atampt said it was pleased with the boards decision but 
spokesman herb linnen said above all we remain gravely concerned 
about the larger implications of the gsas conduct in this entire 
matter clearly based on todays decision something must be done 
to restore public confidence in the integrity of the gsas 
procurements 
the procurement for 12 large electronic switches in the 
governments longdistance telephone network raised concerns about 
gsas handling of bids on contracts for an allnew federal phone 
system known as fts 2000 worth as much as 25 billion over 10 
years 
but gsa in a statement reacting to the decision assured that 
the people who worked on the switch contracts are not responsible 
for the evaluation of fts 2000 the agency also noted it has 
taken steps to ensure security of the fts 2000 procurement 
including restricting access to information about bids 
the seven disputed contracts and five won by atampt worth a 
total of 55 million are being investigated by the gsas inspector 
generals office the justice department and the senate 
governmental affairs committee 
labellas decision with which the other two board members 
concurred affirmed many of atampts charges including the claim 
that gsa engineer sureshar l soni leaked confidential atampt price 
information 
the judge said soni resorted to an auction technique by 
disclosing the price to beat to atampts competitors he also said 
soni improperly accepted gratuities in the form of meals from 
bellsouth and should not have participated in the contract 
procurement at all because his daughter was employed by bellsouth 
soni who has been reassigned within gsa refused to answer 
questions about his role in the procurement invoking his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination in a deposition during 
the course of the boards investigation he also refused to answer 
questions about his daughter neelam soni who was hired by 
bellsouth as a managertrainee in april 1987 when bids were being 
formulated 
labella ordered the two switch contracts previously won by 
bellsouth to be given to atampt because of the disclosures concerning 
soni earlier in the boards investigation bellsouth offered to 
give up the contracts because an internal probe indicated the 
companys bid may have been tainted 
the judge also ordered contracts won by bell atlantic for a 
switch in philadelphia and by pacific bell for a switch in san 
francisco be turned over to atampt he said the gsa discriminated 
against atampt in evaluating its bid for the switches and failed to 
provide atampt sufficient information about certain gsa policies 
he ordered the gsa to reevaluate bids for a seattle switch won 
by us west but he left undisturbed contract awards to bell 
atlantic for a switch in washington and to us west for a switch in 
minneapolis 
he also termed as frivolous gsas attempt to turn the tables on 
atampt by charging that the company also may have received 
confidential pricing information and used it to develop its bids 
in conclusion labella said bias and bidleaking by gsa 
resulted in less than fair treatment of atampt but he said atampt 
failed to establish that any of these actions were taken with the 
specific intent of harming atampt or benefitting the rbocs regional 
bell holding companies 
he attributed the gsa mishandling of the bids to personnel who 
operated with less than a masterful understanding of the actual 
requirements of gsa and of the terms and conditions of the 
solicitation

a federal judge declared a mistrial tuesday in the 
fraud and conspiracy trial of a businessman accused of 
participating in a kickback scheme with gerard indelicato former 
top education adviser to gov michael dukakis 
indelicato who pleaded guilty last month to participating in 
the scheme testified against michael freedman two weeks ago 
indelicato won a recommendation from federal prosecutors for a 
reduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation with what 
assistant us attorney ralph gants called an ongoing 
investigation 
us district court judge douglas woodlock declared the mistrial 
tuesday afternoon after a 12member jury was unable to reach a 
unanimous verdict on one count of mail fraud and one count of 
conspiracy 
the key issue on which the jury appeared to be stumped was 
whether the prosecution had proved willfulness on freedmans part 
in accepting kickback money after the jury raised that question 
tuesday morning judge woodlock reiterated instructions 
later in the day as the deadlock continued gants asked that 
the jury be queried specifically on whether they could find 
freedman guilty on either of the two counts the answer was no 
freedmans defense attorney john burns moved for a mistrial and 
woodlock granted the motion 
woodlock set a new trial date for july 11 
its analagous to a baseball team playing to a 22 tie in the 
ninth and it rains gants said 
burns did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
indelicato testified that the kickback scheme involved skimming 
some 80000 from two adult education programs between 1979 and 
1983 indelicato headed the states adult education program at the 
time the scheme got under way 
according to indelicatos testimony the conspiracy involved 
using federal funds administered by the state to pay more rent than 
necessary for classroom space and then splitting the difference 
among freedman indelicato his brother joseph and a fourth 
conspirator antonio perrotta 
all but freedman have already pleaded guilty gants said it 
would be a mischaracterization to say indelicato agreed to 
plead guilty and win a recommendation for a lesser sentence solely 
in exchange for his testimony in the freedman trial but the 
federal prosecutor declined to specify in what other matters 
indelicato is cooperating with authorities 
indelicato is scheduled to be sentenced july 8 three days 
before the new freedman trial is set to begin gants declined to 
say whether indelicato would testify in the new trial 
prosecutors agreed to recommend to judge woodlock that 
indelicato receive a fiveyear prison term and pay an 80000 fine 
woodlock could exceed that recommendation if he chose 
gants called the recommended punishment a very fair sentence 
indelicato became dukakis education adviser in march 1983 two 
months after the conspiracy alleged by the government ended while 
he worked for dukakis election bid in 1982 indelicato testified 
he was receiving cash kickbacks of hundreds of dollars per month 
from the adult education program 
it was a regular income if you will for all of us 
indelicato testified during freedmans trial 
indelicato said freedman accepted his share and was aware of 
where the money was coming from but his testimony did not depict 
freedman as one of the architects of the scheme

a deadlocked jury forced a judge to declare 
a mistrial tuesday in a 13 million suit filed by two teenagers 
against the heavy metal band motley crue for injuries allegedly 
suffered at a 1985 concert 
the jury told limestone county circuit judge henry blizzard that 
they were at an impasse on their second day of deliberations court 
reporter regeana gentry said 
we will put it on the next civil docket she said of the 
case 
foreman marshall mitchell of athens said later that 10 jurors 
believed the californiabased rock band was not at fault and two 
wanted to award damages because somebody should pay 
attorneys for the injured teenagers claimed the special effects 
display at the huntsville concert propelled dry ice into the 
audience where robbie miller 17 of piney chapel and david hunt 
wright 19 of grant were standing in front of the stage 
miller lost his right eye and wright contends he suffered facial 
cuts 
before sending the case to the jury blizzard dismissed the city 
of huntsville as a defendant based on insufficient evidence and 
the plaintiffs attorneys dropped the bands promoters from the 
suit 
jimmy alexander one of the plaintiffs attorneys said they 
will file for reinstatement of the city as a codefendant within 
the next few days he said he and the teenagers other attorneys 
believe the dismissal of the city as a defendant was a major factor 
in the jury deadlock 
mitchell said most jurors were sympathetic to the plaintiffs 
but insufficient proof of something coming off the stage 
produced the deadlock 
someone could have thrown a bottle there are a lot of things 
that could have happened and if you go to one of those rock 
concerts you are likely to see anything going on he said 
the trial which began may 9 drew crowds of young fans trying 
to catch a glimpse of band member nikki sixx who was in the 
courtroom daily

pope john paul ii on tuesday 
emphasized the importance of public participation in government in 
a meeting with government opponents that gen alfredo stroessner 
initially tried to block 
it is impossible to speak of liberty and democracy the roman 
catholic leader said where there is no real participation of all 
citizens in making the great decisions that affect the life and 
future of the nation 
stroessner who has ruled since 1954 calls paraguay a democracy 
but it is widely regarded as a dictatorship 
the pope was nearing the end of a fournation south american 
trip that has taken him to uruguay bolivia and peru he was to 
leave for rome on wednesday his 68th birthday 
the asuncion meeting with the churchsponsored builders of 
society was abruptly canceled by paraguay last week the first 
time a government had taken such action during any of the popes 37 
foreign trips stroessners regime agreed to lift the ban after the 
vatican protested 
a block of about 60 white plastic chairs sat empty on the floor 
of the enclosed sports stadiy of a company closing the door on the godgiven 
right of a woman to bear children ciresi said 
but strain said attorneys for mrs kociemba would be introducing 
evidence not central to the issues involved in the case 
this is a case about whether they the plaintiffs have met 
the burden of proving that the copper7 caused the infertility of 
mrs kociemba strain said 
the kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in 
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries including 
infertility that mrs kociemba allegedly suffered as a result of 
using a copper7 iud for about 1 years in 1977 and 1978 
ciresi called as his first witness a doctor who testified that 
inserting an iud can introduce bacteria into the normally sterile 
uterus 
dr richard l sweet chief of the department of obstetrics and 
gynecology at san francisco general hospital and coauthor of the 
book infectious disease of the female genital tract also said 
an iud can ulcerate the uterine lining and that the ulcerated 
lining is not expelled completely during a womans menstrual 
period as strain had indicated in his opening argument 
the fallopian tubes which carry eggs from the ovaries to the 
uterus are probably the part of the upper reproductive tract most 
susceptible to infection caused by invading bacteria he added 
mrs kociemba claims that the copper7 infected her uterus 
resulting in pelvic inflammatory disease and ultimately tubal 
infertility 
ciresis law firm robins zelle larson amp kaplan represented 
plaintiffs in many of cases involving ah robins cos dalkon 
shield which was eventually withdrawn from the market the firm is 
representing more than 30 women in copper7 lawsuits against searle 
while the kociemba case is the 18th involving the copper7 
nationwide to go to trial it is the first being tried by robins 
zelle which has said it will introduce internal searle documents 
never before presented 
the firm has said evidence introduced in the kociemba trial is 
expected to set a foundation for lawsuits to come

britain will replace its aging freefall nuclear 
bombs with a new nuclear weapon defense secretary george younger 
said in a bbc interview broadcast monday 
the independent newspaper whose correspondent interviewed 
younger on the tv program said nucleartipped missiles would 
replace the bombs 
the program called replacing the hidden bomb also quoted 
ronald lehman a us assistant secretary for defense as saying 
the united states has been discussing a joint project to build the 
weapon with france and britain 
younger said on the british broadcasting corps current events 
program panorama that details of the new weapon would be 
decided in a year to 18 months 
he rejected the notion that the project might undermine the 
ussoviet intermediate nuclear forces treaty to eliminate an 
entire class of landbased missiles in europe saying the weapon is 
a replacement a modernization of a system which is going out of 
date 
the independent reported that the government wants to build a 
missile with a 300mile range with stealthradar absorbing 
materials the missiles covered by the inf treaty have a minimum 
range of about 310 miles 
the new missiles would replace the british air forces 
20yearold bombs codenamed we177 and would be carried by 
britains tornado bombers the same planes that carry most of the 
old bombs it said 
the old bomb has to be dropped over or very close to its target 
a missile could be launched from a distance and enable the bomber 
to avoid enemy air defenses 
the newspaper estimated that about 200 of the old bombs were 
produced 
it quoted unidentified defense sources as saying the final cost 
of the new missile project was likely to be 3 billion pounds 567 
billion 
last december younger and french defense minister andre giraud 
announced after a meeting that they would study further the 
possibility of an anglofrench missile 
published reports which were not denied by officials said the 
missile would be a longerrange version of frances asmp nuclear 
airtosurface missiles carried by mirage warplanes 
these missiles have a 50125mile range depending on the firing 
angle 
the bbc program quoted lehman as saying the united states 
supported the idea of a threeway project and had discussed it with 
both countries 
lehman said the united states believed that a cooperative 
program would be a very good way for it to modernize its own 
nuclear weapons economically 
when younger raised this in december we thought it was a good 
idea said lehman weve had good discussions in a number of 
bilateral meetings and our first trilateral meeting in march 
giraud also appeared on the program monday he said that 
although he has no objections to a threenation deal he was very 
suspicious of cooperation involving too numerous partners

ancient rivers that once flowed across an

flourished briefly before the red planet turned bitterly cold and 
dry scientists say 
steve squyers a planetary scientist at cornell university said 
that most evidence now indicates that mars and the earth were very 
similar shortly after their formation some 45 billion years ago 
and that conditions that led to the formation of life on earth may 
also have existed on mars 
squyers was among the scientists discussing planetary research 
at a meeting monday of the american geophysical union in an

martian life is soil laid down billions of years ago when water is

sharply this offset a smaller rise in imports which climbed 36

to discover a price increase of any sort in 
todays nervous economic environment is akin to spotting a whisp of 
smoke in a crowded theater the warning alarms go off and everyone 
gets excited 
but not everything that looks like smoke signifies a 
conflagration and not every price increase means inflation most 
economists know this but a goodly number of them seem to have 
forgotten for the moment 
some price increases are reasonable and maybe even desirable 
says professor william c dunkelberg who measures prices and other 
indicators as part of a quarterly economic survey for the national 
federation of independent business 
in the latest survey dunkelberg did indeed find evidence of 
growing price pressures based on detailed reports from 1936 
small and mediumsize companies belonging to the 500000member 
federation 
although not large there is a clear upward drift in the 
percent of firms planning to raise prices he reported this month 
dunkelberg attributes much of this to relatively higher import 
prices after the dollars decline to the opportunity this gave 
domestic competitors to follow suit and to the tightening of labor 
markets 
but then he issued a caveat that has been ignored by some of his 
fellow economists not all price increases are inflationary 
it must be remembered he said that general inflation is really 
a monetary phenomenon meaning in this instance that if the federal 
reserve flooded the nation with dollars it would provide the 
support to keep those prices higher 
but without increases in the money supply some price increases 
have a different meaning a meaning that is as basic as any tenet 
of economics that is price increases are a reaction to supply and 
demand 
if the money supply remains fairly constant rising prices in 
growing sectors will be offset by declines elsewhere as demand 
weakens in less popular sectors he states adding this pertinent 
explanation 
the role of prices is to signal resource reallocation 
he explains where demand grows prices and profits rise to 
generate the needed investment and increase in capacity and to 
attract labor 
where demand falls and profits fade prices will fall 
encouraging resources to leave for greener pastures 
such price changes he says can be confused with general 
monetary inflation and these are days in which that confusion may 
be pervasive 
it is a situation he says that presents an immediate challenge 
for monetary authorities a challenge whose outcome is potentially 
as critical as any other factor in steering the economy on a 
healthy path 
that challenge he says is this 
to determine the extent to which the price changes that 
are occurring are reasonable and desirable before acting to snuff 
out an inflation that may not in fact be present 
there is a lesson in it for the general population and also a 
reminder for those nervous forgetful economists not every price 
increase or decrease needs to be viewed in the context of inflation 
prices serve other purposes too

what is lacking is democracy where 
the people no longer are tricked where there are no monopolies of 
any kind particularly when the monopoly opens the door to 
electoral fraud presidential candidate manuel j clouthier was 
saying 
we are fighting all of this and we are going to win 
we is the national action party which has put up the 
staunchest opposition to mexicos longdominant institutional 
revolutionary party pri which has won every election since its 
inception in 1929 
but national action known as pan has been making deeper 
inroads against pri in northern mexico in recent years and now 
believes it has a better chance than ever to come away with an 
upset in the presidential election july 6 
the 53yearold clouthier a prosperous agricultural 
businessman made his point about winning in an interview with the 
associated press while on a campaign swing through the northwestern 
border state of northern baja california 
he has visited more than 70 cities and towns across mexico in 
his campaign and has sought to portray himself and pan as a 
freemarket alternative to pris political and economic 
centralization 
we are the only real option for change because we are rabidly 
democratic because we want democracy politically economically 
culturally clouthier said we are not in favor of government 
control of the economy we represent a social market economy 
national action is strong in northern mexico but it has never 
been able to build a national base to challenge the pri whose 
presidential candidate is carlos salinas de gortari 
i see that the people of mexico are more disposed to change 
things clouthier said of conditions now they have been 
repressed but are ready to fight once more for the change that they 
yearn for 
our way is distinct the state monopoly is not concerned with 
initiative because it sacrifices everything for the sake of 
control 
maquio as clouthier is popularly known places 
responsibility for mexicos economic troubles on salinas de 
gortari who had served as budget and planning secretary under the 
incumbent president miguel de la madrid 
clouthier supports private enterprise more government 
austerity greater foreign investment and allowing peasants to own 
the land they now are allowed to use and pass on to their children 
but not sell 
for years national action was the only significant opposition to 
the pri but the economic difficulties that have lasted throughout 
de la madrids administration have allowed clouthier and four other 
minority candidates to take a more vocal and visible role this year 
pan cast as a conservative opposition group has strong support 
from business and the roman catholic church hierarchy 
clouthier running on a program for economic construction 
contends that corruption has played an important part in mexicos 
economic crisis 
regarding the foreign debt the majority of which the 
government contracted on the shoulders of the people i would first 
seize the goods of the public officials who have enriched 
themselves he said in the interview 
mexicos foreign debt of 105 billion is the second largest in 
the developing world after brazils 
clouthier favors the return of the mexican banking system to the 
private sector 
since the banks have been ours there has been no credit for 
the campesino peasant he said 
the government of president jose lopez portillo nationalized the 
banks in september 1982 at the outset of the economic crisis 
brought on by falling oil prices 
pan was the runnerup in the 1982 presidential race with 158 
percent of votes against 709 percent for de la madrid

issue or nonissue it still was the question 
united methodists debated whether to retain a rule requiring use 
of grape juice in communion they dropped the rule but most will 
still retain the practice 
that was the curious consequence of a bubbling interlude at the 
churchs governing conference in st louis earlier this month 
throwing a spotlight upon the diverse customs of denominations 
some use wine some juice some both for some its an option 
to be decided congregation by congregation 
whatever the choice it is a feature of christianitys central 
act of worship commemorating the last supper of jesus with his 
apostles before his crucifixion at which he bade them perpetuate 
that sacred meal 
take eat this is my body which is given for you he said 
as he broke bread with them of the wine he said drink this 
is my blood of the new covenant poured out for you and for many 
for the forgiveness of sin 
distinct communion customs among christian denominations 
sometimes produce unusual arrangements in some ecumenical 
settings such as the consultation on church union involving nine 
denominations celebrating communion sometimes has involved two 
tables one dispensing wine the other grape juice 
in general wine is used in churches with classic liturgies 
including the episcopal lutheran roman catholic and eastern 
orthodox churches its also standard in the christian reformed 
church 
among presbyterian united church of christ and reformed church 
in america congregations the usage varies some congregations 
using wine others grape juice some offering both 
grape juice is used in most baptist churches and in the majority 
of christian church disciples of christ congregations although a 
few use wine 
that is also the case for united methodists whose choice of 
grape juice has a commercially tinged story behind it that 
knowledgeable oldtimers insist is real history 
the story is that the founder of the welch grape juice 
enterprise a devoted methodist persuaded the churchs governing 
conference in the early 1900s to adopt a rule requiring use of 
grape juice 
that rule has been on the books ever since a part of the 
rubrics for worship in the church hymnbook reading in its 1966 
edition 
the lords table should have upon it a fair linen cloth let 
the pure unfermented juice of the grape be used 
but that hymnbook its rituals and rubrics were replaced at the 
recent conference and the revised version leaves out the grape 
juice rule 
this omission caused considerable splashes of debate twice 
impelling the rev richard l wright of buckhannon wva to 
intervene with proposals to restore the rule for grape juice 
we have a long tradition of opposition to the use of alcoholic 
beverages in our church he said 
however the rev tex s sample a kansas city mo theologian 
argued that keeping a rule that looks highly moralistic would 
drive off young people who would go elsewhere 
he said research indicates the reason united methodists are not 
increasing is because we are not attracticing those young people 
under 42 or 43 years of age on the cultural left of our country 
if we continue to moralize about these personal issues we 
will drive them away from our denomination and not have a 
compelling evangelical power to draw them into it 
however june goldman a spirit lake iowa delegate said we 
have been adrift and young people want us to say there are 
parameters keeping the rule she said would give definite 
directions to the young 
when we are wishywishy our young people lose faith in us 
she said 
the delegates voted strongly 525 to 343 against retaining the 
rule and also en bloc voted down a batch of similar measures 
thus eliminating the old juiceonly law 
in the new hymnalworship book the communion service uses the 
words the cup and the wine interchangeably while old book 
uses only the cup not mentioning wine as now is done 
even so veteran methodists said the longtime custom of using 
juice would doubtless continue although a few scattered 
congregations use wine

people who live together before marriage 
should be denied a full church wedding because such a wedding 
would be dishonor and instead be married in a lowkey ceremony 
hartford archbishop john f whealon said in a column published in 
the catholic transcript 
i would be happy to witness your marriage in a simple quiet 
ceremony with two witnesses and perhaps your immediate families 
whealon said in comments addressed to priests confronted with issue 
whealon said however couples living together should be granted 
a full marriage ceremony if they are willing to live separately 
and chastely until they are married 
the statement serves as an advisory and does not set policy 
parish priests say they make the ultimate decisions on church 
weddings based on pastoral consideration

drawing parallels between the beliefs of 
christians and the shiite moslems who held him captive for 19 
months the rev lawrence jenco says a better understanding of the 
islamic religion could help us overcome such ignorance and 
stereotyping as we have of the people of islam 
moslems believe as do christians and jews in one god jenco 
said and that common belief could be used to foster justice and 
human rights throughout the world he said 
jenco outlined the tenets of the islamic faith to an audience of 
about 300 at carroll college in opening a threeday conference 
titled prophecy and politics 
jenco was released in july 1986 after 564 days of captivity 
moslems christians and jews are all followers of the same 
living god he said adding that the trialogue among the 
three religions must continue

strapping exuberant bob payton 
britains most famous american entrepreneur has one very prominent 
british characteristic eccentricity 
its evident all over stapleford park the 500yearold country 
house the man who became londons pizza king is turning into a 
hotellikenoother in his latest venture 
for example hell have a fire in the fireplace every day of the 
year not for the heat but for the smell 
then theres the trompe loeil in the grand tea room peering 
over the painted banister is a likeness of gunther mrs paytons 
giant schnauzer wearing a redwhiteandblue bandanna the dog was 
added to the decor to celebrate his release from the sixmonth 
quarantine required of every immigrating pet 
i wanted things to be 5 degrees off payton said explaining 
his desire to have things a bit offkilter 
gunther now trots happily around the 55acre estate in 
leicestershire hunt country where payton and his wife wendy are 
striving to create the american dream of an english country house 
more specifically its a victorian gentlemans hunting lodge 
which opened its doors to guests in april 
its sort of disney world for real said payton who is 6 
feet 4 inches tall and weighs 250 pounds and on this misty day was 
wearing a bold argyle sweater with matching socks 
payton bought the home 110 miles north of london from lord 
john gretton of the bass brewing family more than two years ago he 
used 14 million of his own money and since has spent millions 
more of investors money renovating it 
payton who became famous and wealthy by bringing chicagostyle 
deepdish pizza to london is deliberate in his details and panders 
to american notions of what is english 
the 23 rooms and suites which cost 160 to 611 a night have 
been decorated not only by the usual interior designers but also by 
wellknown english companies chosen for their recognizeable brand 
names 
for the wedgwood room the chinaware makers chose handprinted 
wallpaper in its bluewithwhitecameos jasper design 
shirtmakers turnbull and asser hung framed bow ties and curtains 
made of forest green velvet of the smokingjacket variety lined 
with silk paisley 
the liberty room is cheered with the fabric designers renowned 
smallflower prints 
the 125room house with a grand sweeping staircase is long on 
marble mahogany paneling 16foot ceilings leather sofas and 
framed pictures of british royalty 
peek into the loo the mens room and heads of wildebeests 
stare down at you from high on the walls 
not wanting the hotel to look too new he ordered reproductions 
of victorian spigots 
from the stone mullion windows are stunning views of gently 
undulating green countryside featuring sheep frolicking horses in 
a grazing paddock and a still lake 
payton has worked under the close scrutiny of british 
preservation officials who have allowed him some distinctly 
american flourishes too like the miniature golf course and a 
basketball net and backboard homemade chocolatechip cookies are 
left on bedside tables in the rooms 
payton who went to the university of north carolina at chapel 
hill and still gulps diet soda from an oversized school mug is 
treating the hotel like an informal house party 
the land rover that picks up guests at the train station half 
an hour away in grantham arrives with a cooler stocked with 
chicago beer 
its not going to be a health farm said payton 
he has lived in britain for 15 years and first saw the house in 
1980 while he was riding to hounds or fox hunting 
i walked through the front door of the place and i knew it had 
to be preserved for what it was payton said this is quite a 
staggering edifice 
at the time he added i was looking for something new to 
invent i thought what am i going to do with my life once ive 
created my business 
payton launched that business with a pizza restaurant in 1977 
when he quit the j walter thompson advertising agency which had 
hired him in chicago and transferred him to london 
payton had worked his way through college playing drums in a 
rock band and went on to northwestern university in evanston 
ill to earn a masters degree in advertising 
the son of a traveling salesman payton was born in troy ny 
and reared in miami 
although he had trouble raising the initial 66000 for his 
first pizza restaurant his company became hugely successful and 
will be operating 14 restaurants with names like chicago pizza pie 
factory and chicago rib shack in london and on the european 
continent by the end of the year 
the company is called my kinda town ltd payton says that 
refers both to chicago and london and had an aftertax profit of 
188 million on revenue of 21 million in 1987 
payton managed to raise 85 million for stapleford park by 
privately selling stock in my kinda town in which he retains a 
majority interest 
what makes this hotel a bold experiment is that its in a part 
of the country that has traditionally attracted few tourists 
it is a twohour drive from heathrow airport in london or a 
90minute train ride from londons kings cross station before you 
get into the rover and take a beer from the cooler 
payton who lives in a private wing of stapleford park is 
relying on word of mouth instead of advertising and says not only 
americans will come to his hotel 
americans dont want to come here and meet other americans 
he said the worst thing is people coming here and its all 
americans 
bookings are pretty good said payton who expects the 
operation will break even in the first year and make a profit in 
the second 
and if he fails he can always sell the house which he now 
values at about 12 million 
however he says profit is not his principal motive in 
stapleford park 
ive done my bit for society by preserving this payton 
said ive given this house the opportunity to live again like it 
did in its heyday 
carved on the outside of the limestone building is william 
lord sherard baron of letrym repayred this building anno domini 
1633 
payton had a mason carve in an addition and bob payton esq 
did his bit anno domini 1988

sandyhaired alex singer an american ivy 
league honors graduate and jazz lover dreamed of being an artist 
or writer but religious fervor brought him to israel and to his 
death as a soldier on his 25th birthday 
lt alex singer was killed in a raid inside lebanon on sept 15 
but his talents as an artist and writer live on in 200 pages of 
diaries 
he has left behind a rare portrait of an israeli soldier 
the diaries are filled with pencil drawings of military 
maneuvers army camps and the barren landscape of war 
the words in verse and prose are of his thoughts as a 
commander of other men in war and tell of listening for the sound 
of enemy footsteps in southern lebanon and confronting palestinian 
anger in the occupied gaza strip 
some of the notebooks were found in singers kitbag the day he 
was shot on a mission to flush out palestinian guerrillas trying to 
infiltrate israels northern border settlements his family gave 
copies to the associated press 
in verse done while still in officers training singer 
confronts his feelings about the day when he will face combat 
if the war comes 
when the war comes 
i will have to lead men to die

but those men were not men a short time ago

i will have to have the calm power

alex singer came to israel in december 1984 seven months after 
graduating summa cum laude from cornell university in ithaca ny 
three days later he joined the army 
his brother daniel 22 said alexs deepening attachment to 
judaism moved him to emigrate and join the military 
as a jew israel played an important part in his life and it 
wasnt enough to talk about it but to act daniel said in an 
interview he considered it a duty and an honor to help defend 
the country he wasnt trying to prove anything here it isnt like 
in the states where the army seems distant here its part of 
life 
little in singers early days points to a future as a combat 
soldier daniel said family life in washington dc was not 
religious the boys father max is a writer for the jewish 
magazine commentary and mother suzanne is a magazine editor 
alex was not athletic he suffered from asthma and was a 
bookworm a loner on travels he went off by himself to sketch 
landscapes he took solace in the jazz of ella fitgerald and louis 
armstrong and the folk rock of simon and garfunkel 
a boyhood trip to israel inspired alex to think seriously about 
judaism said daniel in college his jewish identity became so 
intense that he devoted his thesis to the subject 
for the thesis letters from the diaspora alex traveled to 
london moscow and cordoba spain in search of jewish life 
later he visited jordan and daniel said it was the trip to the 
arab world that solidified alexs feeling for serving israel 
there he really learned what the arabs think of us it really 
brought it all down to earth for him said daniel who also 
served three years in israels army 
in the military alex combined his talents for writing and 
drawing with his duties his journals are filled with meticulous 
drawings of weapons such as israelimade galil rifles grenades 
and tow missiles 
on a page dated july 9 1987 singer sketched an officer 
briefing soldiers before a battalion exercise in the golan heights 
near the syrian border 
the troops sweated up a hill attacking a mock syrian base but 
singers record was mostly about losing his prayer shawl and 
phylacteries or prayer straps in a bag that disappeared in the 
charge 
we ran and retraced our exact steps he wrote i was just 
about to give up looking when twothirds up the hill i saw the bag 
on the ground right where we started charging 
in training singer dedicated one diary page to a drawing of his 
feet with arrows pointing to callouses and bunions he bemoaned the 
life of a foot soldier and talked of transferring from the infantry 
to the tank corps

nevertheless he volunteered for the givati brigade an elite 
combat unit famed for its fight on the egyptian border in the 
independence war of 1948 
the givati troops get the toughest jobs and singer frequently 
wrote that he was glad to be guarding the northern frontier 
i like this type of frontline duty he wrote in january 
1986 being in lebanon makes all that goes on closer i feel 
pride when i know that we are the ones sent in the end to do the 
work 
in later entries singer described in painstaking detail missions 
he commanded along the border in one instance he wrote about 
being on watch in a wooded border post 
i heard footsteps on the other side of the fence 20 yards 
from our gang i put a bullet in the chamber of my gun and looked 
to find the source of the steps 
my heart was beating fast and we were ready to open fire i 
passed an order left and right not to shoot until they hear me 
shouting fire the tension was unbelievable after 15 minutes or 
so the sounds stopped it must have been a wild boar or 
something 
in an entry last summer singer wrote of awakening to find the 
platoons sentries asleep near the border fence near what israelis 
call mount dov the site of battles between the israelis and 
palestinian guerrillas attempting to infiltrate 
there is no doubt that my waking up on my own saved one or 
more of us from paying the corresponding price 
the diaries also include descriptions of a month in 1987 in the 
occupied gaza strip a coastal zone crowded with 600000 
palestinian refugees 
most of these accounts reflect the hostility and fear of 
soldiers in street patrols and housetohouse searches for 
guerrilla suspects 
i saw palestine written on a door singer wrote we 
stop i call a man from the house take his id tell him he gets 
his id when the graffiti is gone he calls his wife who brings 
h2o and washes it 
but singer also wrote that he tried to teach men in his platoon 
to be tolerant of arabs in an entry titled idea for teaching 
about the difference of a jewish army singer wrote 
we can go either way 1 arabs as jukim cockroaches or 
2 arabs as people 
israel must take the second path because israel is a jewish 
state a democratic state and a light unto nations 
four months later singer was sent on his final mission into 
lebanon and got the first taste of combat hed written about in 
verse two years before 
according to other accounts of the day guerrillas hiding behind 
boulders surprised singers patrol with bursts of gunfire just 
after the israelis landed near mount dov by helicopter singer was 
shot as he ran up a hill taking a medic to a wounded comrade 
president reagan praised singers heroism in a message of 
condolence to his parents 
daniel said the family is proud of alexs devotion to israel and 
plans a public exhibit of his drawings and diaries 
but he added it does not make up for a lost brother 
this is something that takes the glamour out of being in the 
army he said its like having a hole where something was you 
cant fill it you have to walk around it

an editor on an influential soviet newspaper told 
his dinner guests how he had spent much of his afternoon arguing 
heatedly with his colleagues about a particular article 
it was wonderful he said i get drunk on glasnost 
glasnost the new openness that tolerates such intellectual 
disputes now spilling from the editorial conference rooms onto the 
pages of some soviet journals is the most apparent manifestation 
of the changes soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is trying to make 
in his drive to modernize a slothful giant 
it is visible not only in the newspapers which are swamped with 
letters to the editor of almost every stripe but in cultural life 
and on the streets as well 
longbanned books are finding publishers works of art hidden in 
storerooms since the early days of communist rule are being 
exhibited and theaters movie houses and concert halls are jammed 
with patrons anxious to see and hear the latest experiments with 
ideas that were unwelcome in this country for years grievances 
rooted in longrepressed ethnic and nationalist concerns have 
sprouted as well igniting demonstrations strikes and even deadly 
riots 
at the same time the better life promised by gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring is still evanescent 
the soviet editor who got drunk on glasnot left work early 
that day to hunt for wine or vodka to serve at dinner the search 
proved futile and his wife had to take two different buses across 
town to find a suitable piece of meat to serve to her guests 
thats just one example of the enormity of gorbachevs task to 
bring about economic reform 
the problems he faces also are illustrated daily on the streets 
of moscow as the city prepares for the arrival next week of 
president reagan and a horde of foreign journalists 
a team of eight laborers has been sent to refurbish the 
childrens playground in the center of the countrys largest 
compound for foreigners at practically any time of day a casual 
glance at the worksite reveals six of the workers sitting down or 
standing idle watching the other two work 
a workman sent to replace the linoleum floor of an elevator in 
an eightstory building shut off the lift for an entire afternoon 
while he measured and cut a new piece of flooring and nailed it in 
place with broken molding he had ripped out with the old flooring 
when the job was finished the new linoleum didnt fit and was 
so thin that puncture holes appeared within a week the floor 
undoubtedly will look as bad as the old one in a matter of months 
to instill a work ethic or pride of craftsmanship will take more 
than daily exhortations by the communist party to work harder in 
order to enjoy the fruits of perestroika 
the soviet union is a land where shoddy craftsmanship and 
grudging service are the norm machines break down and their 
operators shrug rather than embark on what they know will be a 
long and frustrating search for repairs 
human resources are squandered on makework jobs people have 
money but there is nothing to buy 
offering incentives such as higher pay for better work is 
among the innovations being tried but skeptics also must be 
persuaded there will be something for them to purchase with their 
increased incomes and even a desire to do the job right doesnt 
help much when parts and materials are ordered by central planners 
who dont necessarily send them when and where they are needed 
speaking to a gathering of farm workers in march gorbachev said 
people are willing and able to pay for consumer services but the 
trouble is there is seldom any person or establishment supplying 
them 
to help fill that gap the government has agreed to permit 
cooperative ventures in which individuals may get together to start 
their own businesses offering goods and services to the public 
thousands of these have sprung up in the form of restaurants 
groceries car repair shops cleaners even computer services 
there is at least one coop that provides a directory of other 
coops but the prices at the new establishments generally run high 
and have met considerable resistance from consumers accustomed to 
paying heavily subsidized state rates 
the new enterprises also have sparked resistance among communist 
party conservatives who fear gorbachev is leading them toward 
capitalism 
as soon as an offbeat decision is made there is an outcry 
gorbachev told a recent meeting of newspaper editors and 
ideologues he quoted his opponents as wailing help socialism 
is in danger they are spawning private operators 
the depth of the opposition is difficult to measure in a society 
where virtually all discussion by decisionmakers takes place in 
secret but recurrent rumors of power struggles at the top and 
publication of ideological disputes that seem to flow from those 
struggles are unsettling byproducts of glasnost 
resistance to change is strong in this society where change all 
too often has brought horrors beyond comprehension at least two 
major famines have swept the country in this century one after the 
bolshevik revolution and civil war the second when dictator josef 
stalin forced farm collectivization in the 1930s 
western historians estimate as many as 20 million perished in 
the purges as stalin eradicated his rivals and drove the country 
relentlessly to industrialize and that another 20 million died in 
a desperate struggle for survival against nazi invaders in world 
war ii 
against that backdrop the security of a job however menial 
housing however cramped and food however plain is hardly 
insignificant risks like those inherent in a freeenterprise 
system or a market economy can appear terribly threatening to 
people whose lifelong goal is little more than security 
in two giant steps toward improving peoples sense of security 
gorbachev has successfully negotiated the first weapons treaty with 
the united states that bans an entire class of nuclear arms and he 
has begun to withdraw soviet troops from the protracted war in 
afghanistan where they had been bogged down for eight years 
gorbachev has instituted competitive elections of some 
supervisory personnel in plants and lowerlevel party officials in 
a move to make the bureaucracy more responsive and to root out dead 
wood and corruption and he has begun to prune the party and 
government apparatus in an efficiency drive that has frightened 
many who think they see the spectre of unemployment looming on the 
horizon 
he also has sought to reassure people that his more pragmatic 
approach to socialism will improve their lives not threaten them 
this society will inevitably be more multilayered he said 
but it will remain socialist and it will not forgo the 
principles of social justice comradeship and internationalism in 
the slightest

ten years ago da captivated broadway audiences with its 
irish charm and insights into fatherson relationships now da 
has been translated to film and as the irish might say a lovely 
movie it is 
time which sometimes dims the best of stories seems to have 
burnished the glow of da which transports viewers from 
presentday new york to a rural irish village with cobblestone 
streets and fragrant gardens 
it is here that we meet da the shorthand name for father 
barnard hughes whose portrayal won awards on the new york stage 
recreates the role of the old man whose death stirs up an emotional 
whirlwind for his adopted son charlie 
martin sheen is charlie a successful playwright who returns to 
his irish homeland for the funeral of his adoptive father and is 
haunted by memories of the man whose complex personality colored 
his sons life 
i love you da sheen tells the father whose ghost 
selfconfidently replies why wouldnt you 
that question leads sheen on a tortuous journey back to his own 
childhood reliving the worst moments through now critical eyes 
das interference in charlies youthful pursuit of a neighbor girl 
becomes humorous in retrospect a sequence in which charlies 
mother decrees that the rambunctious family dog must be drowned and 
da sets out to do the deed is agonizing das outrageous defense of 
hitler while charlies prospective employer visits the family makes 
the old man out as something of a fool 
but there are better times remembered as well and charlie is 
inevitably lured back by his fathers irish magnetism as da 
declares love turned upside down is love for all that 
hughes portrayal of da is about as pefect as acting gets the 
white haired blueeyed hughes creates the magic that makes da the 
inhabitant of his sons dreams sheen is just right as charlie 
resentful but loving determined to shed his fathers ghost but 
unwilling to let their relationship die 
there are other fine performances here karl hayden makes an 
impressive film debut as the selfconscious young charlie william 
hickey is memorable as drumm charlies first demanding employer 
and doreen hepburn as charlies mother projects the combined 
sweetness and strength of a realist who sees her gardenerhusband 
for what he is 
matt clark directed the film which is often seen in the brown 
and gold tones of memory a costar certainly is ireland in 
particular the village of dalkey which was playwright hugh 
leonards home the seaside vistas the green hills and the 
extraordinary rose garden which leonards father the real life da 
planted 60 years ago are part of charm of this thoroughly 
satisfying film 
da is rated pg running time is 102 minutes

how do retailers know what will sell and what 
wont among the 500 or more home videos available each month 
boxoffice hits such as fatal attraction beverly hills 
cop ii and dirty dancing are sure shots regardless of their 
artistic demerits then there are sleeper films such as prick up 
your ears that attracted small audiences and might not make 
whopping good rentals 
some video store owners are turning to video forecaster a 
report published by bimonthly by warren adler who uses consumer 
polls and other marketing tools to give retailers the odds on a 
particular movie 
in the may 115 edition for example barfly starring faye 
dunaway and mickey rourke received a high consumer awareness 
level and a good from critics but the much acclaimed hope 
and glory only got a poor awareness level and a rave from 
critics 
fatal beauty the whoopi goldberg bomb had a very high 
consumer awareness level but a poor rating from critics 
the publication also lists stars a synopsis of the film 
consumers intent to rent or buy medium for barfly and hope 
and glory but very high for fatal beauty box office 
grosses number of weeks it ran and comments from video forecaster 
on how it will do 
weve reduced our purchasing now to a few hours a month 
said j fred sproule of super video inc in seattle we buy for 
60 stores and spend over 100000 a month on video so this has 
become very valuable to us 
bruce george of sundance audio and video in yuba city calif

real men is a farout farce about male bonding and role 
reversals that sinks under the weight of its own absurdity 
the funny parts appeal to those who laugh at assassinations car 
bombings kidnappings gun fights and double crosses all of which 
happen in the first 10 minutes 
a macho cia agent played by james belushi coerces the help of a 
wimpy suburbanite insurance agent played by john ritter in order to 
save the world ritter happens to look just like a dead cia agent 
the mission is to get to washington within five days to get a 
secret formula from space aliens who have an antidote to a poison 
that is destroying the food chain and will make the earth lifeless 
in five years 
wait theres more 
the unlikely pair must contend with soviet agents and a faction 
in the cia that wears clown suits the cia clowns have a different 
deal for the spacemen they want a gun capable of destroying the 
planet instead of the antidote 
on their wacky journey ritter meets belushis father who had 
a sex change operation and comes on to ritter 
later in a pittsburgh bar tough guy belushi falls in love with 
a whipcracking seductress ritter meanwhile sheds his 
milquetoast mannerisms by foiling a robbery and completing the 
mission 
the price asked by the spacemen to save the world is a glass of 
water the payoff somehow matches the drippy comedy

chalk mark in a rain storm geffen joni mitchell 
 
joni mitchell doesnt need any help but she is nevertheless 
joined by an allstar cast on this eclectic profoundly political 
effort the cast is just as varied willie nelson billy idol 
peter gabriel don henley tom petty wendy and lisa and even iron 
eyes cody makes a guest appearance 
the cuts include some remakes a jazzy version of corrina 
corrina titled a bird that whistles featuring wayne shorter 
on sax and cool water yeah that song by the sons of the 
pioneers a duet with willie nelson 
mitchell seems to be having more fun musically on this album 
than she has in the past but in some ways she seems almost 
visually oriented casting parts in the songs and referring in an 
interview to one of them as cinematic 
her own material evincing at various times her folk jazz and 
rock influences is emotional and highly political 
the tea leaf prophecy is a poignant reminiscence of wars 
past set against a melodic chant study war no more gabriel 
sings on the lovely my secret place henley trades vocal leads 
with mitchell on the wry snakes and ladders iron eyes cody 
intones the opening lines of lakota a pulsing hopi lament 
recorded appropriately enough at peter gabriels studio in 
bath england the beat of black wings was written after the 
us bombing of libya the lyrics are the words of a soldier

green thoughts capitol smithereens 
 
ever since john paul and george strapped on guitars and sat 
ringo behind the drum kit thousands of kids have devoted their 
lives to a search for the perfect melody its a wonder the classic 
1960s song structure can still sound fresh today 
the smithereens a new jerseybased quartet do better than 
most their crisp melodies and tight performances made 1986s 
especially for you an unusually strong debut and the new 
green thoughts is a worthy followup 
actually those 60s comparisons probably rankle the 
smithereens as much as bands want to emulate their heroes from 
those days a reputation as a band more interested in the past than 
the present could be a death sentence 
that fear seems to be a motivating force encouraging the 
smithereens to stretch a bit they know the rock graveyard is 
littered with nondescript jangly guitar bands 
on songs such as drown in my own tears and the world we 
know guitarist jim babjak employs a basslike fuzztone that 
rattles the backbone fortunately the smithereens are equally 
adept when things quiet down with the ballad especially for 
you noteworthy for its sax solo by los lobos steve berlin 
green thoughts may be more appropriately titled after a 
darker shade lead singer pat dinizio whose odd goatee gives him 
the look of a beatnik is one lonely guy consequently the record 
is topheavy with songs of shattered romance and latenight 
yearning 
that can be done well of course elaine is a particularly 
pretty take on that theme but dinizios already come close to 
exhausting it maybe a girlfriend would help 
given the welldocumented pitfalls of new bands trying to prove 
they have more than one good album in them the smithereens can be 
proud of green thoughts

if tom hanks seems like a grinning optimist 
on the screen its not just acting 
when i wake up in the morning im a pretty happy guy he 
says im not one of these guys who rolls out of bed and is 
groggy for an hour and a half until he has blueberry pancakes and 
six cups of coffee i wake up and the sun is shining or the clouds 
are raining and i think its great either way 
where that comes from i dont know ill leave that off to 
the dna genetic materials that my parents planted in me 
hanks has more than the usual reasons to be happy nowadays he 
stars in two promising comedies this summer big in which he 
plays a 12yearold whose wish to be an adult is granted 
punchline in which he costars with sally field as a pair of 
aspiring standup comics 
and on march 30 he married actress rita wilson whom he met 
while both were appearing in volunteers 
until now hanks has mostly been seen with costars darryl 
hannah splash john candy volunteers shelley long 
the money pit jackie gleason nothing in common dan 
aykroyd dragnet with big hanks flies solo though he 
draws strong support from elizabnt and debonair 
the highlight of big provided the biggest physical 
challenge hanks and his boss loggia perform a dance in new 
yorks fao schwarz toy store on kingsize piano keys tapping 
out chopsticks and heart and soul 
it was a huge dance number that required hours and hours and 
hours of rehearsal stretched out over a sixweek period hanks 
said when we finally finished shooting it i said our long 
national nightmare is over 
like tom cruise demi moore rebecca de mornay and other stars 
of his generation hanks had an unsettled childhood his parents 
divorced when he was young and he moved back and forth between 
them growing up in northern california he figures he and a 
brother and sister changed homes every six months instead of 
growing withdrawn he became a joker 
part of it is a selfdefense mechanism he reflected i 
moved around a lot when i was a kid and found myself in new cities 
and with new friends and new family members it also comes from a 
brand of communication that was developed between my siblings and 
my mom and my dad 
hanks discovered theater at sacramento state university and was 
invited by director vincent dowling to join the great lakes 
shakespeare festival in cleveland he moved to new york then came 
to hollywood in 1980 to star in the wellremembered bosom buddy 
series for abc the series untimely end freed hanks for films and 
he has been working steadily ever since 
he has played a variety of roles but producers view him as a 
comedian he remains philosophical about being so pigeonholed 
i have made my peace long ago with the fact that im a funny 
guy he said i treated it like a curse for a long time but 
its just as much of a fact that i have two feet 
the fear of being labeled as a comedian i dont care id 
rather just let the sum total of all the work just speak for itself 
over the long haul

the secret of the spoleto festivals success is 
that there is no real program says composer gian carlo menotti 
who has led the arts celebration for three decades 
we do whatever we feel like doing we surprise our audience 
and the press he said 
we are against all commemorations during the anniversary of 
bachs birth we do beethoven during the anniversary of beethoven 
we do stravinsky we keep away from everything that is somewhat 
dictated we use instinct and imagination we dont announce a 
program two or three years in advance because we never know what 
were going to do 
this year at the 112event spoleto festival usa in 
charleston sc menotti felt like presenting dvoraks 1901 opera 
rusalka since the first act is supposed to take place under 
water rusalka has only been done in this country a handful of 
times since its american premiere in 1935 
john paull iii technical production manager for broadways 
the phantom of the opera is in charge of rusalka he is 
swathing the stage in chinablue silk for the water and bringing 
soprano maria spacagna as the water nymph rusalka who lives in 
the lake onto the stage through a trap door 
her father the water sprite at one point becomes angry and 
creates a whirlpool the silk spins round and round 
menotti founded the festival of the two worlds in spoleto 
italy in 1958 and later founded the spoleto festival usa in 
charleston this year it runs from may 20 to june 5 and the 
spoleto festival of the three worlds in melbourne australia he 
still heads all of them 
we create a festive atmosphere menotti said in a recent 
interview i always think of it involving the whole town i 
wanted to see if an artist can be as important a member of a 
community as a doctor the people of charleston have the dignity of 
knowing arts are needed 
menotti recently directed his 1950 opera the consul in 
bulgaria the opera which opened the first spoleto festival usa 
in 1977 is set in an unidentified police state in which a woman 
tries to get a visa for another country where her husband has found 
refuge 
i never thought i would ever see the consul in bulgaria 
he said i think they feel it is about some other country i had 
no trouble i asked somebody if the translation was faithful and 
the answer was yes the audience stood and cheered 
now the government has asked me to do a film of it in bulgaria 
in english they offered to pay for everything the whole 
production they only thing is they cannot pay foreign singers 
they have no dollars soprano mirella freni wants to sing the 
woman her husband bass nicolai ghiaurov is bulgarian theres no 
reason his character the chief of police shouldnt have an accent 
i accepted if im still alive im going to do it next 
year menotti will be 77 in july 
the composer also recently has been in korea where two of his 
operas amelia goes to the ball and the medium were done 
in korean last year 
unfortunately they were a big success the day before i left 
the head of the olympic games talked me into doing an opera the 
only sport i do is tennis and i only win when my son lets me win 
he said 
i asked what sort of opera i should write the olympic arts 
festival gave me the choice of three possible subjects i chose the 
one i like best for the marriage it was supposed to be ready in 
january and wasnt the premiere is to be in september in seoul 
and menotti will direct 
menotti will compose a piece for chorus and orchestra for the 
atlanta symphony and will direct tosca for the washington opera 
next spring it is a promise i made to placido domingo its my 
swan song as a director of operas other than my own 
hell also direct when domingo sings the title role of goya 
which menotti composed for him in spain next february in its 
european premiere 
menottis first grandchild will be a year old in july he is 
called claudio in honor of composer claudio monteverdi he 
already bangs on the piano he is very angry because i play 
something for him and he cant make it himself i know he is 
musical 
i play for him he listens and looks at my hands then he 
bangs then he looks at me then he gets very frustrated he said 
the composer of amahl and the night visitors would like to 
do another childrens opera 
help help the globolinks is doing very well and so is 
the boy who grew too fast he said i think it is marvelous 
to write for children but i dont know i dont want to become the 
brother grimm of opera

country music singer george strait has a 
crisp tenor a lean frame and a career that is rolling like the 
tumbleweed in his native texas 
the 36yearold performer has recorded nine gold albums 
incorporating a blend of ballads about broken hearts and happier 
times 
in seven years of entertaining he has helped revitalize 
hardcore country music while maintaining a family tradition as a 
fourth generation cattle rancher in the lone star state 
strait has twice been voted male vocalist of the year by the 
country music association but says of his singing i feel that 
im just getting started 
with more than 20 no 1 records to his credit the gentleman 
cowboy has established himself as a top concert draw treated much 
like pop star tom jones the handsome strait finds boots flowers 
room keys cowboy hats womens underwear and various other items 
thrown on stage 
it surprises me he said in an interview people are so 
generous i get nice gifts like quilts afghans artwork i know it 
took them a lot of time to make them 
he has performed for almost 50000 at the houston astrodome and 
says singing for that many people can be intimidating 
its very scary and exciting he said you cant see them 
but you can feel them 
he believes his audiences appreciate his concert mixture of old 
country songs plus his own material such as all my exs live in 
texas ocean front property and his most recent no 1 hit 
famous last words of a fool 
i just go out and do my songs and dont tell jokes or do a lot 
of talking strait said 
strait was born in poteet texas and grew up in pearsall 
texas as the son of a junior high school math teacher who was a 
parttime rancher he went into the army after high school where he 
taught himself to play the guitar by reading some hank williams 
song books 
after the army he earned a degree in agriculture from southwest 
texas state university in san marcos and sang in small bars and 
clubs throughout texas 
he enlisted his band the ace in the hole band by putting up a 
flier on a campus bulletin board three of them are still with him 
he went to work as a rancher and for two years was foreman of a 
1000head cattle ranch at night it was off to sing 
id have about half an hour to get cleaned up and get to that 
nights gig he said of his crowded schedule 
two selffinanced records went unnoticed he visited nashville 
in 1976 and 1978 hoping to sign a recording contract he was not 
successful and instead took a fulltime job designing barns and 
other ranch facilities but at the last minute he decided to try 
music for one more year 
he was finally signed by mca records in nashville in 1981 
strait is noted for his white cowboy hats pressed jeans and 
starched buttondown shirts that all accent his trim athletic 
appearance 
during my career ive always tried to project a clean look 
he said i feel this is important to my fans even though ive 
been criticized for being too wrinklefree 
he writes few of the songs he records but does make most of the 
decisions about picking album material 
i think what i look for first is the melody he said i 
look for something a little different then i listen to the lyrics 
and if it will fit me 
i dont look for any specific type of song but if i have a 
lot of ballads picked i start looking for uptempo material for 
balance 
i have always gone into the studio to make it better than the 
last one each time i feel i have 
many of his songs have texas cities in their title such as 
amarillo by morning and does fort worth ever cross your 
mind 
its pure coincidence he said those were strong songs 
amarillo by morning was one wed been doing for a long time 
before i recorded it thats why we released it 
his current album which has been no 1 on the country charts 
is if you aint lovin you aint livin hes also completed 
a 60minute concert video george strait live 
but hes had to cope with tragedy his 13yearold daughter 
jennifer was killed in an automobile accident in june 1986 that 
october he dedicated his cma award to her 
as he prepared to set out recently on a concert tour he said 
about his success i would like to think talent had a lot to do 
with it the material has been good and the timing had a lot to do 
with it

the reagan administration working group on the 
stock market crash has issued a report recommending a variety of 
modest financial market changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of 
last octobers market crash 
the panels major recommendation monday was adoption of a 
circuit breaker mechanism to shut down trading in the stock and 
futures markets when extreme market movements threaten the entire 
system

bank of new york co says it may drop its 
sevenmonth hostile effort to acquire irving bank corp now that 
irving management apparently has won a heated proxy battle for 
control of the company 
irving had no specific results monday but said a preliminary 
count of proxies submitted at its may 6 annual meeting showed 
shareholders reelected a slate of incumbent directors over bank of 
new yorks 16 nominees 
bank spokesman d emerson phelps said the results were released 
by corporation trust co an independent elections inspector based 
in wilmington del a final vote count is expected at a reconvened 
shareholders meeting may 24 
reelection of irvings directors would amount to a vote of 
confidence in the companys defensive restructuring plan and stock 
sale to staterun banca commerciale italiana spa italys 
secondlargest bank the proposal was made as an alternative to 
rival bank of new yorks 1 billionplus hostile tender offer 
which expires friday 
this vote of confidence in irvings board is gratifying 
irving said in a statement 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings common shares the offer is valued at about 63 a share or 
108 billion 
the company said monday that it held about 62 percent of 
irvings common shares including its own shares and those tendered 
to it the company said its offer was contingent upon it receiving 
twothirds of irvings 185 million common shares outstanding 
irving was unchanged at 6062 a share monday on the new york 
stock exchange while bank of new york rose 125 to 32 a share 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said the company was 
disappointed by irvings announcement monday and was reviewing all 
of its options including dropping its bid brady refused to 
elaborate 
banca commerciale is offering 75 a share for 95 million irving 
shares about 51 percent of the outstanding common stock for a 
total of 7125 million in addition it said it would pay 
shareholders interest on the purchase price from may 31 until the 
deal closes 
the banca commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that includes sales of assets such as irvings 50story wall 
street headquarters costcutting measures and a special 
10ashare cash dividend irving said the offer has a blended 
value of between 6520 and 7255 a share 
banking experts said they were surprised by irvings apparent 
victory in the proxy battle 
most analysts had given bank of new york an edge mainly because 
it already had secured the necessary regulatory approvals from the 
federal reserve and new york state banking boards banca 
commerciale which is controlled by the government agency instituto 
per la recostruzione industriale has just begun the lengthy 
regulatory review process 
i guess all the right analysts were wrong once again said 
stephen berman of county securities usa 
james mcdermott an analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods said 
barring a change in attitude by irving management it would be 
unlikely that the bank of new york would acquire irving 
i guess as a practical matter it probably takes the bank of 
new york offer out of play he said 
irving has staunchly resisted bank of new yorks advances since 
they began in late september 
hostile takeover efforts are very rare in the banking industry 
a bank of new yorkirving merger would have created one of the 
nations 15 largest banks with assets of more than 40 billion 
banca commerciale has assets of about 60 billion

state local and company officials werent 
popping champagne corks when boeing co landed a 369 billion 
commercial jet order but they nevertheless were delighted about 
the years of economic stability expected to stem from the sale 
as the saying goes whats good for boeing is by and large 
good for seattle laughed danne mount spokeswoman for the city 
of seattles department of community development 
the order boeing announced monday represented the lions share 
of a record 504 billion 130plane purchase by international 
lease finance corp which leases planes to many of the worlds 
airlines europes airbus industrie consortium got the rest of the 
order 
rr albrecht executive vice president in charge of sales and 
marketing for boeing commercial airplanes said the order would not 
change production schedules 
but it will add stability and keep the worlds leading airplane 
manufacturer working at full capacity through 1991 even if boeing 
receives no other airplane orders albrecht said 
boeing employs 90000 people in the seattle area and directly 
or indirectly provides for one of every four jobs in a metropolitan 
area of 15 million people ms mount said 
but the ripple effect of mondays 100plane order will be felt 
by the whole state through the early 1990s said dick milne gov 
booth gardners press secretary 
any time boeing gets an order of that magnitude its good news 
for the whole state said milne it may not mean a single new 
job but it means that the ones we have are secure through 1995 
mondays order easily put boeing on a record sales pace one 
that industry analysts said may quicken more as recent safety 
incidents prompt airlines to review their aging fleet and consider 
orders for new planes 
george d shapiro of the investment firm salomon brothers in 
new york said boeing sales may be spurred by the aloha airlines 
boeing 737 that lost part of its fuselage killing a flight 
attendant before landing safely earlier this month 
one of every four airplanes today is over 19 years old what 
that says to me is the potential for future sales for boeing 
shapiro said 
passengers are concerned and thats going to put pressure on 
the airlines to replace older planes he said 
in the first five months of 1988 boeing has amassed 116 
billion in orders the previous yearly high was last years 199 
billion in jet orders the 1988 total already is the airlines 
third highest total with seven months to go 
boeing now has a backlog of 930 airplanes to deliver 
the companys portion of mondays order consisted of 72 planes 
of models 737300 737400 and 737500 eight 757200s nine 
767300ers four 747400s and a previously unannounced order of 
six planes in the 737 series and one 757200 
boeing valued its share of the contract at 46 billion 
including the price of 24 additional planes on which international 
lease finance has purchase options 
the largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986 when 
british airways ordered 16 boeing 747s for 23 billion that deal 
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the 
value to 41 billion

texaco inc and carl icahn its biggest 
shareholder and main potential antagonist are discussing how to 
resolve their differences without continuing a proxy fight over 
five seats on the oil giants board 
the company said late monday that it and icahn also had agreed 
to support a oneweek adjournment of its june 7 annual shareholder 
meeting if each party requested it in order to facilitate the 
discussions 
icahn who is chairman of trans world airlines inc has 
nominated five candidates including himself for texacos 14member 
board the election is scheduled for the june 7 annual meeting in 
tulsa okla 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company has filed a 
federal court suit to block icahn from soliciting proxies and 
accusing him of securities law violations 
the company claims icahn is trying to get texaco to buy back his 
148 percent stake at a premium to force texacos acquisition by a 
third party or to acquire texaco and liquidate its assests 
but in a statement late monday from white plains texaco said it 
and icahn were engaged in discussions seeking to resolve their 
differences without continuing a proxy contest 
the statement said texaco and icahn stressed that any resolution 
of their differences will not include consideration for any 
shareholder that is not equally available to all texaco 
shareholders 
any such resolution would also require that texaco be 
satisfied that it would retain an investment grade credit rating 
the statement said 
to facilitate such discussions texaco and mr icahn have 
agreed that each of them will vote the shares and proxies under 
their control to support an adjournment of the annual meeting from 
june 7 to june 14 if a request is made by the other party to do 
so it said 
in trading on the new york stock exchange on monday texaco fell 
62 cents a share to 4887 
icahn began buying stock in texaco while texaco was negotiating 
a settlement with rival pennzoil co over a 103 billion judgment 
awarded pennzoil after a texas jury found texaco had interfered 
illegally with pennzoils merger with getty oil co 
texaco filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy code last year to forestall payment of the massive 
judgment it emerged from chapter 11 last month under a 
courtapproved reorganization plan that included a 3 billion 
settlement with pennzoil

eds updates with other banks cutting rate includes details of 
reported rift 
london ap britains major commercial banks announced on 
tuesday they would cut their base lending rate by half a percentage 
point to 75 percent heeding a signal from the central bank which 
was an apparent effort to stem the strong pound 
the recent strength in the pound has caused a reported rift in 
the government 
national westminster bank plc barclays bank plc lloyds bank 
plc and midland bank plc cut the benchmark borrowing rate 
effective wednesday after the central bank cut its moneymarket 
dealing rate to 75 percent from 7 percent 
the pound plunged on the news which surprised the markets 
it was quoted at 18740 and 31550 west german marks down from 
18810 and below 318 marks just before the central bank announced 
its move at about midday 
the latest cut brings the base lending rate to its lowest level 
since april 1978 natwest said the base rate previously was cut on 
april 8 when it was lowered half a point to 8 percent 
corporate borrowers can obtain loans at one percentage point 
above the base lending rate 
the bank of englands move came when sterling actually was 
weakening a bit on on unconfirmed reports that prime minister 
margaret thatcher an advocate of freemarket policies would back 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons desire for a more 
managed exchange rate 
mrs thatcher who has expressed concern that sustained 
intervention could fuel inflation was to answer questions in the 
house of commons later in the day and she was likely to be 
questioned closely on exchange rate policy mrs thatcher 
repeatedly has cited fighting inflation as her main economic aim 
lawson suppports curtailing the pound through interest rate cuts 
and central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets a 
strong pound could hurt british exports and corporate profits

with britains economy on the upswing a 
new phenomenon has emerged employers cant find workers to fill 
many jobs 
the buoyant economy is creating new jobs very quickly and they 
require new skills hence britain has 25 million people 
unemployed but 700000 job vacancies 
it totally amazes most people because theyre constantly 
bombarded with articles about unemployment said bill horsman 
managing director of 98yearold hatmakers w wright and son ltd 
in luton a town that suffers from this problem 
the trades union congress britains umbrella labor 
organization blames industry for failing to train workers 
employers acknowledge that companies havent trained or 
retrained enough workers but they also maintain that britains 
schools have failed to equip students with proper skills 
the schools counter that while this was true in the past they 
are more responsive today 
adding to the problem are the economic disparities among 
britains various regions which discourage job seekers from 
relocating because living in one place mainly the southeast can 
cost so much more than in another 
at the same time school graduates whose numbers are shrinking 
because of lower birth rates shy away from the sweatshop 
work such as in lutons hat industry and oily dirty 
engineering that in a country like west germany is a highstatus 
profession said brian sykes manager of an employers selfhelp 
group called the bedfordshire network 
while unemployment stood at 9 percent in march the number of 
unfilled jobs was up 15 percent from a year ago according to the 
department of employment 
luton a city of 150000 people 28 miles northwest of london 
had 1199 vacancies and 7641 unemployed people or an estimated 8 
percent of the work force 
you have this peculiar situation where you have a relatively 
high unemployment rate which coexists with quite a large number of 
unfilled jobs partly because of the skills shortage said sykes 
for horsman the hatmaker it means you cant take on new 
business because you cant fulfill the orders 
the traditional industries are vulnerable because they are 
having trouble replacing their aging work forces 
the shortage not only makes companies less productive but also 
forces them to pay more to attract employees that cuts into 
profits and can fuel inflation 
luton also is more expensive to live in because its proximity to 
london pushes up house prices discouraging people from other the 
less expensive areas to move here 
but things are looking up 
local schools are teaching skills the job markets need 
commercial training companies also have stepped in to fill the gap 
and profit from it 
the conservative governments manpower services commission has 
launched various plans under which it and employers jointly pay 
employees during training 
the trades union congress has called for the government to 
require employers to train workers and pay for it 
separately employers have set up 80 networks around the country 
to identify the shortages and start training programs 
in the meantime individual companies have taken other steps 
horsman for example has bought stitching machines and uses 
glue guns to cut down on the number of seamstresses he needs he 
also uses 10 outside workers mostly young women with children who 
trim hats at home 
a year ago he built a new 132million factory 
if you cant attract people to a factory like this you might 
as well give up horsman said 
but he still hasnt been able to find the six to 10 extra 
workers needs to boost his 3 million annual production by 20 
percent

eight years ago britains largest bank discovered 
it was being hurt because more and more of women managers were 
leaving to have babies and not coming back 
thats when national westminster bank became the first of a 
number of british institutions to take a radical step it offered 
maternity leaves for as long as five years 
open mainly to young executives natwests pioneering career 
breaks program also is open to men but the emphasis is on women 
and could help revolutionize britains traditionbound working 
world as the economy soars and a labor shortage looms 
the programs have been criticized however as too limited 
career break programs are very much geared to managerial and 
professional occupations said carole truman a research fellow 
and author of a study of career breaks 
theyre still very few and far between but it may have opened 
the door to enabling people to take a more flexible approach to 
work 
zeena gooch a 30yearold natwest assistant manager who 
recently returned from five years off says that without the 
program she may never have come back 
you lose your confidence when youre away and youre out 
of touch she said 
companies offering career breaks include several other banks as 
well as esso uk plc a computer company and six government 
ministries 
but overall britain is behind others on national leave 
programs childcare facilities and flexible working hours 
in terms of a range of options were lagging far behind 
other european countries said bronwen cohen head of policy at 
the governmentfunded but independent equal opportunities 
commission 
under a 1976 law only about half of working women qualify for 
maternity leave ms cohen said in an interview 
only women who have worked at least 16 hours a week for the same 
employer for two years or at least 8 hours a week for five years 
can get their jobs back after 40 weeks off the government is 
considering raising the limit to 20 hours a week 
in france most pregnant workers get maternity breaks for as 
long as two years and in spain three years ms cohen said the 
european economic community is studying a threemonth parental 
leave as a legal minimum for all 12 member nations britain is an 
eec member 
the us congress is considering legislation to create a 
national 25week leave only 20 to 25 us states have legal 
maternity leaves averaging two months according to the 
congressional committee on womens issues 
when british women quit their jobs to have children most dont 
return to the same company studies show 
the equal opportunities commission found 20 percent of 
nonworking mothers stayed home because they wanted to care for 
their children but twothirds said they quit working for lack of 
childcare or flexible work hours 
when they return to work usually after five years they often 
must take lowerpaying lowerstatus or parttime jobs ms truman 
said in an interview 
ms gooch said that without her banks program i would have 
had to start again or come back as a cashier 
natwest lost threequarters of the 80 women a year who took 
maternity leaves before the fiveyear plan was introduced it now 
offers breaks to men and women with managerial potential who have 
been with the bank for five years and will stay 20 years more when 
they come back 
those who take the long breaks work for two weeks a year attend 
annual seminars and receive regular updates on the office 
annette weller a mother of two on a civil service career break 
said it doesnt keep you up with the work you were doing but it 
keeps you in touch with whats happening in the office its an 
initial step back

twenty years ago the chairman of a major company 
asked a professor to help him evaluate the executives who worked 
for him especially in regard to what might be expected of them 
the professor eugene e jennings had developed a reputation 
for analyzing corporations and the people who manage them and 
already had advised many chief executives on executive personnel 
matters 
this assignment was different before he could project the 
performance that might be expected of the executives he would first 
have to determine who they were and what made them do the things 
they did 
it required him to develop an analytical framework should he 
fail to develop one he feared he might find himself doing what he 
had often criticized in the news media that of judging a top 
executive on style alone 
style is perhaps the least important aspect of an executive 
says jennings professor of business administration at michigan 
state university and author of many books on institutional 
leadership 
style is a reflection of temperament the degree to which a 
person is for example vociferous brusk patient passive and so 
on but the person who focuses on style never gets to 
substance jennings says 
he believes it is much more rewarding and revealing to focus on 
the persons personal and functional values or operating 
principles the individuals own view of his or her role their 
technique of decision making 
evaluate executives on that basis and you will have a much 
fuller picture of the person he advises the media stock market 
analysts authors executive headhunters and others who he says 
customarily fall into the style trap 
he refers to his system as vtrs 
v is for personal and functional values every executive he 
says has certain values that foretell behavior if you want to 
find out about your boss values ask yourself what would most 
upset my boss if i did it 
president jimmy carter for instance wanted nothing given to 
him that had not been formatted or put into a logical format from 
which he could make judgments jennings says 
t is technique of decision making for example is the chief 
analytical or intuitive 
some chiefs says jennings require lots of data and get 
involved in intense analyses others might need little data some 
need many sources others few 
r is for role every executive has a view of his or her job that 
goes beyond the usual job description it is that persons 
essential justification for being the boss 
what is his or her driving force how does the boss view his 
or her role in history what will history say about the boss 
s or style is easy to spot says jennings since it involves 
outward and obvious personality traits it lends itself to colorful 
and even dramatic descriptions but seldom does an analysis of 
style get far beneath the surface 
jennings observes that style analysis cannot help a reader 
understand how for example 10 executives fail to get along 
because they have incompatible operating values disparate views of 
each others roles and employ decisionmaking techniques that 
require varying amounts of time information and people 
he suggests that those called upon to analyze the uniqueness of 
executives use his guide or a similar one as a means of avoiding 
the style trap 
he warns against books by socalled insiders such as 
speechwriters speechwriters are provided peepholes in which they 
learn just enough in order to write the story but not enough to

to 97 billion the lowest monthly shortfall since march 1985 the 
government reported today 
us producers sold a record amount of goods overseas in march 
slicing by 295 percent the february deficit of 1383 billion 
the commerce department said us exports shot up 23 percent to 
an alltime high of 2897 billion while imports rose only 36 
percent to 3872 billion the trade deficit is the difference 
between the two 
the besieged dollar was boosted by news of the dramatically 
improved trade performance the us currency was trading at around 
12590 japanese yen in new york shortly after the figures were 
released up from 12495 yen earlier in london

production surged 07 percent in april the biggest gain in six 
months the rise was more than three times as rapid as the 02 
percent march increase and pushed overall industrial output up 64 
percent from a year ago 
the april increase reflected widespread production gains at 
manufacturing plants where output rose 07 percent factories 
producing durable goods expected to last three or more years saw 
output climb 09 percent while plants making nondurable goods 
boosted output by 04 percent 
auto production which had been lagging as manufacturers tried 
to work down a huge backlog of unsold cars jumped sharply for a 
second straight month with passenger cars being assembled at an 
annual rate of 7 million units up from a rate of 66 million in 
march 
the overall production increase in april was the strongest since 
a 11 percent rise last october output slowed a bit early in the 
year reflecting in large part a drop in auto production 
still the slowdown was nowhere near as severe as some 
economists had forecast immediately following the october stock 
market crash which had raised concerns of sharp production 
cutbacks early this year that could push the nation into a 
recession

us treasury secretary james a baker iii said 
tuesday the sharp drop in the us trade deficit in march confirmed 
a clear trend toward closing the gap between the nations imports 
and exports 
the commerce department reported in washington that the american 
trade gap shrank to 97 billion in march as us exports surged to 
record levels the february deficit had been 1383 billion 
the us trade deficit has been declining in volume terms for 
quite some time said baker who was in paris to attend a meeting 
of western trade and finance ministers starting wednesday while 
monthly figures will tend to fluctuate it is nevertheless clear 
that the us trade deficit is now also declining in nominal terms 
as well 
baker was referring to the fact that the trade gap measured in 
nominal dollar terms has been fed by the effects of a weakening 
us dollar which has boosted the value of imported goods even as 
import volumes have leveled off 
world trade imbalances are expected to be a central focus at 
bakers two days of meetings this week with his counterparts from 
the 23 other member countries of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development agriculture and other economic 
policies also are to be discussed

the dollar surged against other major currencies 
today bolstered by news of a betterthanexpected us trade 
performance in march 
but stock prices turned mixed following a shortlived rally 
sparked by the trade figures while bond prices dropped after an 
initial strong advance 
the commerce department reported today that the trade deficit 
shrank more than 4 billion in march to 97 billion the lowest 
monthly shortfall since march 1985 us producers sold a record 
amount of goods overseas in march slicing by 295 percent the 
february deficit of 1383 billion 
the report triggered a sharp rise in the dollar on foreign 
currency markets 
the dollar jumped to around 12590 japanese yen in new york from 
12495 yen earlier in london and rose to just under 171 west 
german marks from 169 marks the british pound dropped to around 
185 from 189 
stock prices rose broadly after the trade report was released 
but then gave up most of the gains 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which climbed 
back over the 2000 level late monday on expectations that the 
trade shortfall would narrow was down 249 points at 200514 at 
11 am edt on wall street 
after an initial surge inspired by the trade news bond prices 
dropped as traders began to look more closely at the statistics 
they were disappointed that us imports rose during the month by 
36 percent to 3872 billion 
in addition the bond market viewed the 23 percent jump in 
exports to an alltime high of 2897 billion as a sign the 
us economy could overheat from the surge in production of export 
goods and thereby intensify inflationary pressures 
inflation erodes the value of fixedincome investments such as 
bonds and tends to depress bond prices and drive interest rates 
higher 
bond traders saw further evidence that the economy risked 
overheating when the government reported at midmorning that us 
industry operated at 827 percent of capacity in april the highest 
level in more than eight years 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond was down about 
point or 5 for every 1000 in face value at around midmorning 
its yield rose to 916 percent from 911 percent late monday

stocks rose broadly this morning after the 
government reported an unexpectedly large drop in the trade 
deficit but the rally quickly faded in another sign of postcrash 
investor apathy and fear of inflation 
the fact that it waned so quickly is disappointing to me 
said peter j dapuzzo manager of retail equities at shearson 
lehman hutton inc the psychology is negative and low one number 
isnt going to change that 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which rose about 
15 points at the opening on the trade news retreated by 11 am 
edt to 200514 down 249 
among broader market barometers the new york stock exchange

american exchange the market value index was unchanged at 29796 
advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines on the nyse with

the improvement was a major surprise initially driving the 
dollar sharply higher and rallying the bond market a sensitive 
barometer of the economy but bond prices later retreated 
some economists interpreted the trade figure as another sign of 
a rapidly growing domestic economy which translates into higher 
inflation and rising interest rates 
that theory was reinforced by another economic statistic 
released this morning from the federal reserve which showed 
american industry operated at 827 percent of capacity in april 
the highest level in more than eight years

the worlds two biggest computer companies and 
five others are rebelling against the efforts of american telephone 
amp telegraph co to control a critically important computer 
operating standard 
the rift has the potential to slow progress in creating computer 
programs that can run with little or no modification on a wide 
range of machines 
pitted against atampt and its silicon valley partner sun 
microsystems inc are giant international business machines corp 
and digital equipment corp as well as hewlettpackard co apollo 
computer inc and three european companies 
top executives of the seven companies appeared at a news 
conference today to announce creation of an open software 
foundation which would create a computing standard independent of 
atampt 
ibm digital and the others believe atampt and sun are exerting 
too much control over the operating system known as unix a layer 
of software that controls basic computer operations 
atampt invented unix and licenses it to other computer makers for 
use on their machines the dispute is important because unix is 
becoming a major force in the computer industry because of the 
ease with which it runs on computers of different designs 
in a rare display of power ibm chairman john f akers digital 
president kenneth olsen and hewlettpackard chief john young made 
appearances at todays news conference 
its not every day we find so many heavyweights in the ring at 
the same time young said we all agreed to redefine the rules 
of the next round of battle 
the european companies that participated in the news conference 
are siemens ag and nixdorf computer ag of west germany and groupe 
bull of france 
the companies will each contribute about 45 million a year to 
the open software foundation for the first three years it was 
announced 
the seven computer makers are irked by the requirements atampt 
imposes on companies that license the latest version of unix 
licensees must assert that they comply with certain atampt standards 
for the way their versions of the operating system hook into 
applications software such as database managers 
as a last resort if companies failed to bring their versions 
into compliance atampt could revoke their unix licenses 
digitals olsen said the open software foundation was not 
intended to compete with atampt and said that atampt had in fact been 
invited to join 
but robert kavner the new president of atampts data systems 
group said in an interview today if we did join we would put 
unix and the future of open systems in the hands of a foundation 
that has inherent conflicting motives among its sponsors 
some critics of ibm and digital have questioned whether ibm and 
digital really want to promote an industrywide computing standard 
since that could liberate their customers to buy other companies 
computers and software 
michael defazio atampts director of software systems said 
computer users and independent software developers are happy with 
the companys efforts to ensure uniformity because it makes it 
easier for them to run programs on a variety of machines 
defazio denied claims that atampt and sun microsystems were 
working to make sure that future versions of unix worked best on 
their own computers 
atampt recently agreed to buy a stake of up to 20 percent in sun 
a mountain view califbased maker of scientific and engineering 
workstations that has been moving into other segments of the 
computer industry 
the computer companies said the open software foundation would 
create a new software environment that would go beyond an 
operating system to standardize other aspects of the computers 
software including the way computers hook together in networks 
for a starting point the new software will be based on ibms 
version of unix known as aix it will comply with standards 
specified by posix a project of the institute of electrical 
engineers and xopen an international standardsetting 
organization 
posix stands for portable operating system environment 
the seven companies in the open systems group are suspicious of 
atampt and its role in overseeing unix said greg cline an analyst 
for the yankee group in boston but atampt is suspicious of those 
companies too cline said 
its like verifying nuclear treaties onsite he said

when steve wynn first visited here in 
1952 sharing his fathers dream of a flashy bingo parlor on a 
patch of desert called the strip 5 million could have bought the 
clump of casinos that captivated the 10yearold 
today wynn is spending more than a hundred times that amount on 
a desert paradise that staggers even his immense imagination a 
new golden nugget hotel and casino on the las vegas strip 
the youngster who was starstruck by this neon fantasyland 36 
years ago has become nevadas golden boy with a penchant for 
pizazz and a flair for doing deals he promises the best is yet to 
come for the city that sent his father back to maryland in 1952 
nursing busted dreams 
you aint seen nothin yet boasted wynn chairman of golden 
nugget inc and listed by forbes magazine as one of the 800 most 
powerful executives in america 
equally at home in the boardroom or at the blackjack table wynn 
has taken the golden nugget from a honkytonk casino in downtowns 
glitter gulch to one of the nations premier gaming companies with 
revenues of about 190 million a year and hes betting 550 
million that his new resort scheduled to open in the summer or 
fall of 1989 will be a wonderment the world will flock to see 
wynn already has 200 million invested in the golden nugget 
downtown where the las vegas gaming industry was born he says his 
new 3300room property on the strip now attracting a more upscale 
breed of gambling visitor is the forerunner to other giant 
developments there 
for half a billion dollars you could have owned the entire 
state of nevada wynn said comparing his blossoming resort with 
his first visit to las vegas in the 50s 
his father michael hoped to open a bingo parlor on the 
sparselysettled strip in those days but a downtown casino heard 
of his plans and opened its own operation forcing wynn and his son 
to return east ironically that casino was the golden nugget 
steve wynn returned to las vegas in 1967 with a 35000 
bankroll he engineered a deal with the late billionaire howard 
hughes for a piece of land next to caesars palace resold it to the 
resort months later for a 1 million profit and used that money to 
buy into the nugget 
today that 1 million would hardly cause a ripple in this 
gaming capital 
weve already invested more money in this property downtown 
than the entire capital expenditure of the city of las vegas 
wynn said in a recent interview in his plush office atop the 
downtown resort 
the enormous megabuck investment is not only necessary it has 
become the safest route to take wynn said weve learned that 
a destination resort like las vegas is the perfect launching pad 
for bigger and better projects this place is a big huge roaring 
successful destination resort with people coming from all around 
the world 
with nearly 17 million visitors expected in 1988 and tourism 
growing at a doubledigit pace each year wynn says golden nugget 
wont be the last giant property built on the booming strip where 
20000 new hotel rooms are under construction or planned 
wynn admits he suffered from an attack of cold feet seven years 
ago when he shelved plans for a similar project down the strip 
from his present development 
i started one of these babies for 400 million in 1981 and 
chickened out wynn recalled we didnt know the impact of new 
jersey on nevada we had a recession starting that scared the 
dickens out of everybody we didnt know how las vegas would handle 
a recession how it would handle a recession including atlantic 
city and deregulation of the airlines there were no nonstop 
flights here from the east coast anymore 
those questions were frightening frightening enough for me to 
say hey i aint gonna spend 400 million we could make a 
mistake now five six years later we saw what happened with the 
recession practically nothing we saw what happened with the 
airlines that hurt a little bit but we overcame it we saw what 
happened with atlantic city 18 billion in gambling in nevada 
in 1979 to 5 billion today nobody dreamed there was that kind of 
elasticity in america 
wynn said he has already talked with caesars chairman henry 
gluck about joint ventures on major sporting events particularly 
boxing when completed late next year the nugget and caesars will 
occupy a onemile stretch of the famous strip 
wynn bristles at competitor donald trumps claim that atlantic 
city has stolen from las vegas the title of boxing capital of the 
world trump has in recent months landed the megabucks mike 
tysonlarry holmes fight and the upcoming tysonmichael spinks bout 
hed better make that claim while he can because he wont be 
able to make it long wynn vowed 
the two gaming giants are hardly best of friends trump has been 
quoted as calling wynn a classic underachiever wynn has called 
trump twinkle toes 
the two were competitors when wynn owned the golden nugget in 
atlantic city wynns sale of the atlantic city nugget to bally 
corp for 440 million last year was a factor in blocking trumps 
efforts to take over ballys 
months later trump announced he had bought a 49 percent stake 
in golden nugget inc and indicated he might try to acquire 
controlling interest in wynns company wynn still fumes over the 
publicity trump generated from that move 
he did that for publicity and admitted it wynn growled 
he never owned 5 percent he owned 2 or 3 and he sold it right 
away 
will the new nugget be locking horns with trump for the big 
fights you bet we will wynn vowed 
wall street analysts are generally high on wynn and his 
enthusiasm but a little less confident about the gaming markets 
capacity to support his dreams 
daniel lee an analyst for the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc said wynns income estimates for the new resort may 
be overly optimistic considering the competition on the strip 
the big uncertainty is what that casino can do lee said 
i think it will be successful because of steve wynn

national broadcasting cos plan to buy a cable 
television channel promises to forge the strongest link to date 
between rival segments of the television business 
with primetime network ratings dropping and cable advertising 
revenue rising even the owner of toprated nbc television is 
looking for ways to broaden its base 
analysts say nbcs new cable channel which it plans to use as 
an outlet for sports and business news could boost the return on 
its investment in information gathering and provide a hedge against 
further erosion in the audience for network broadcasts 
this could be a model for what happens in the industry over 
the next couple of years said media industry analyst peter 
appert of the investment firm cyrus j lawrence morgan grenfell 
inc 
the audience for the three major networks has slipped in recent 
years as viewers turned to cable independent and pay television 
and videocassettes in the just completed television season for 
instance the primetime audience for the three major networks fell 
9 percent 
at the same time advertisers have spent more on cable 
television ad spending on cable networks alone is expected to rise 
20 percent this year to more than 1 billion industry analysts say 
although cable audience ratings and ad spending remain only a 
fraction of what the networks get a trend is evident 
the broadcast networks have reached a relative stage of 
maturity while cable still has the largest portion of its 
growth curve ahead of it said larry gerbrandt a senior analyst 
for the media research firm paul kagan associates in carmel calif 
the companies that own the three major broadcast networks have 
already taken their first steps into the cable business 
nbc owns a 24 percent stake in the arts amp entertainment cable 
network which has about 32 million subscribers it is proposing to 
buy tempo television a cable network with 12 million subscribers 
capital citiesabc inc the parent of the abc television 
network owns 80 percent of the espn sports cable network with 
about 46 million subscribers 38 percent of arts amp entertainment 
and 33 percent of lifetime cable network with about 389 million 
subscribers 
cbs inc which owns the cbs television network operated a 
cultural cable channel in the early 1980s but dropped the project 
after a year when it failed to generate sufficient viewers and 
advertising revenue 
in each of these cases the cable networks operated autonomously 
from the broadcast operations nbc said it plans to operate its 
cable network separately from its broadcast network but wants to 
have broadcast network talent contribute to the cable sports and 
business news programs that it hopes to launch by early 1989 
while nbc executives say details of how that will be done are 
being developed tom rogers an nbc vice president said nbc wants 
to stamp a visible imprimatur of nbcs resources on the cable 
programming 
the clearest indication of that he said would be to have 
people familiar from the nbc network appearing on the cable 
programs as well 
another feature of this cable proposal that makes it different 
from the others is that nbc plans to offer cable operators a chance 
to buy a piece of the sports programming service terms have not 
been disclosed but rogers said nbc would retain majority interest 
of the sports service 
nbc president robert c wright had spoken often of his desire to 
get into cable a segment in which he worked before taking over at 
nbc in 1986 
nbc would buy tempo television from telecommunications inc a 
denverbased concern that is the nations largest cable operator 
the price was not disclosed but it has been reported to be about 
20 million 
telecommunications president john malone said in announcing 
the deal that the cable industry benefits from highquality 
programming and he wanted to encourage nbcs efforts to provide it 
some nbc affiliates have expressed concerns that nbc may pay 
less attention to its network operations but others said nbc 
executives have repeatedly assured them that the broadcast network 
remains the companys main interest 
eric bremner president of broadcasting for king broadcasting 
co in seattle which owns three nbc affiliates expects nbcs move 
into cable will ultimately benefit the affiliates 
nbc could bid for the rights to sports events confident it can 
sell the rights to secondary events to its cable partner the 
networks have struck such arrangements with espn for instance for 
events such as tennis or golf 
it could also test programs on the cable service and bring them 
to the network if they prove popular 
the truth is other business entities are moving into these 
same areas we wont be wellserved if nbc sits on the sidelines 
and lets these developments pass by bremner said 
but cbs has no plans to get back into cable anytime soon the 
cbs television network finished third for the first time this past 
season in the primetime ratings and laurence a tisch cbs chief 
executive said he doesnt want to do anything to distract his 
managements attention from regaining first place for the network 
nbcs cable plans of airing business news in the daytime and 
sports at night bears a strong resemblance to the format at 
financial news network inc the fnn cable network has provided 
financial news since 1981 and currently offers business news by 
day sports at night and home shopping overnight 
david meister president of fnn said he is confident his 
service is lean and driven enough to compete effectively against 
nbc 
we take them seriously but think we can prevail he said

the white house today defended an 
administration report on the stock market crash after it drew a 
cool reaction on capitol hill 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the document an 
excellent report and said president reagan feels its 
recommendations are sound we feel the report represents the 
actions that should be taken fitzwater said 
however the reaction in congress ensured that lawmakers will 
continue work on bills aimed at altering the exchanges operations 
im very disappointed with the report i think its flatly 
wrong senate banking committee chairman william proxmire 
dwis said monday shortly after the reagan administrations 
working group issued its recommendations for preventing future 
market plunges 
the group headed by treasury secretary james a baker iii said 
that a circuitbreaker should be put in place that would halt 
trading on all stock futures and options markets for an hour 
should the dow jones industrial average fall by 250 points a 
second twohour close should occur if the dow drops by 400 points 
the group said 
the market has only dropped more than 250 points once in its 
history the 508point plunge of last oct 19 it has swung wildly 
ever since 
the group created in march also recommended improvements in 
the ways traders transactions are completed and in coordination 
among federal agencies that oversee the markets in addition they 
said the group should continue functioning to help deal with 
problems as they arise 
but the group which also consisted of federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan securities and exchange commission 
chairman david s ruder and commodity and futures trading 
commission chairwoman wendy gramm failed to suggest other moves 
that have found support on capitol hill and elsewhere 
they concluded that the margins or downpayments for stock 
stock index futures and options are adequate they failed to agree 
on whether steeper margins should be required in an effort to 
dampen speculation a move ruder supported but the other three 
opposed margins for futures trading are much lower than for stock 
transactions 
they also ignored a recommendation issued in january by a 
presidential task force headed by investment banker nicholas f 
brady that a single agency preferably the fed should oversee 
intermarket issues currently the cftc oversees the futures 
markets while the sec and the fed regulate the options and stock 
exchanges 
the group also urged no actions that would limit the use of 
program trading the computerdriven transactions that critics have 
blamed for volatility on the stock and futures markets 
it is unrealistic and perhaps counterproductive to try to undo 
the changes in financial markets or market strategies brought about 
by improvements in telecommunications and computer technology 
the report said 
legislation may or may not take place treasury 
undersecretary george d gould who sat in for baker at most of the 
groups meetings said at a news conference but the fact is 
there were some things we could agree on and put in place which we 
felt are important to the integrity of the markets and important to 
investor confidence 
but proxmire who has introduced legislation that would set up a 
panel consisting of officials of the fed sec and cftc to 
coordinate market regulation criticized the report 
it shows a lack of sensitivity to whats keeping the 
individual investor out of the market the volatility he said 
all the evidence is that the small investor has gotten out of the 
market 
asked if he would continue to seek passage of his bill he said 
absolutely 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee faulted the group for 
its failure to recommend that one agency oversee the markets and 
for not urging a change in margin requirements 
now its congress turn to take the ball and put forward 
meaningful market reforms said markey who is drafting his own 
bill 
rep john dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee of which markeys panel is a part said the group had 
made some useful recommendations he called for the 
administration and its working group to work with congress to deal 
with the overall problem 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt 
whose panel oversees the cftc and the futures exchanges called the 
recommendations a start he said a federal role in setting 
margins needs to be studied

warner communications inc and 
lorimar telepictures corp announced tuesday they had signed a 
definitive agreement for warner to acquire lorimar producer of 
dallas and other hit tv shows in a stock swap 
the deal announced may 10 would have a value of about 630 
million based on warners midday stock price of 3350 on the new 
york stock exchange 
the agreement calls for holders of lorimars 453 million shares 
outstanding to receive 415 shares of the new yorkbased 
entertainment conglomerate for each share of lorimar 
the transaction scheduled to close in september requires 
regulatory approval and the approval of a majority of lorimar 
shareholders 
in addition to the stock trade warner agreed to assume 
lorimars debt of about 550 million 
after announcement of the tentative merger agreement lorimar 
disclosed that investor marvin davis who previously had expressed 
an interest in the company was considering a 15pershare bid for 
lorimar his earlier bid dismissed by many analysts as not being 
serious was 17 a share 
lorimar chairman merv adelson has made it clear he prefers the 
stock swap 
the merger would add a leading producer of network and 
syndicated television shows to warners already strong movie and 
music businesses 
in addition to dallas lorimar produces such network series 
as knots landing and alf and has a strong lineup of shows 
that are syndicated or sold directly to individual television 
stations 
the merger agreement allows lorimar to back out if warners 
stock price doesnt average an amount that would bring lorimar 
shareholders at least 15 a share if lorimar cancels it must pay 
warner 10 million and if lorimar is acquired by a third party 
warner has the right to but 185 percent of the company at 15 a 
share

prime minister margaret thatcher apparently 
healing a rift with her top treasury official said tuesday she 
advocated the use of interest rate cuts and central bank 
intervention under the right cicrumstances to manage the pound 
mrs thatcher who reportedly has disagreed strongly with 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson over how to respond to the 
strong rise in the pound since march made the comment in 
parliament just hours after britains central bank sent a signal to 
the commercial banks to cut interest rates 
the prime minister who has championed free market policies 
maintained during a session of parliament that she and lawon who 
believes in managing exchange rates were in agreement 
when asked whether there was complete and total unanimity 
between her and lawson she replied yes 
mrs thatcher who repeatedly has cited fighting inflation as 
her economic aim had expressed concern that sustained intervention 
could fuel inflation 
lawson favors curtailing the pound through rate cuts and 
intervention in the foreign exchange markets a strong pound could 
hurt british exports and corporate profits 
we will use the available levers both interest rates and 
intervention as seems right in the circumstances mrs thatcher 
said 
she said it would be a great mistake for any speculator to 
think that sterling is oneway bet 
britains major commercial banks announced earlier tuesday they 
would cut their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 75 
percent heeding a signal from the central bank which cut its own 
moneymarket dealing rate 
the pound fell sharply after the cuts were announced 
in london it cost 18540 to buy one pound after the rate cut 
and the release of betterthanexpected us trade figures cheaper 
than 18855 in the morning and cheaper than 18915 late monday 
the prime minister said in parliament the rate cut would not 
have an inflationary impact on the economy because the rising pound 
had tightened monetary conditions meaning there is less money in 
the monetary system 
dealers said mrs thatchers comments didnt have much of an 
impact on the pound which already had risen on the rate cut 
the base rate cuts earlier today already told us that thatcher 
aligned herself with lawson in trying to cap sterlings rise one 
dealer said 
mrs thatcher and lawson sat together during the session

the us trade deficit shrank dramatically to 
97 billion in march a drop of more than 4 billion as 
american producers sold a record amount of goods overseas the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said that american exports shot up 23 
percent to an alltime high of 2897 billion while imports were up 
36 percent to 3872 billion the trade deficit is the difference 
between the two 
the march deficit was the lowest monthly imbalance since march 
1985 and represented a 295 percent improvement from the february 
deficit of 1383 billion 
the march improvement was a major surpise and sent the dollar 
soaring on foreign exchange markets in european trading the 
dollar climbed against the british pound and the japanese yen 
everyone is breathing a tremendous sigh of relief this is the 
breath of fresh air we have been waiting for said jay goldinger 
an analyst with capital insight a los angeles investment firm 
goldinger predicted that the trade improvement would strengthen 
president reagans position and make it more difficult for congress 
to override his promised veto of the omnibus trade bill 
indeed the white house seized upon the report as new support 
for the veto 
we have said for some time that there is no good time for bad 
trade legislation but todays report demonstrates that this is the 
worst time spokesman marlin fitzwater said this is no time to 
shoot ourselves in the foot and stymie job creation 
but the speaker of the house rep jim wright of texas said 
todays report does not lessen the need for the trade bill to 
become law 
the trade deficit is five times as high as it was when 
president reagan came into office wright said by the end 
of 1987 the united states had amassed the highest trade deficit 
for any nation at any time in history 
in a second report today the federal reserve said that american 
industry operated at 827 percent of capacity in april up 03 
percentage point from march it was the highest operating level in 
more than eight years and was further evidence analysts said that 
american manufacturers are benefiting from the boom in export sales 
all the good news was in sharp contrast to the jolt financial 
markets recieved a month ago when the february trade report was 
issued the unexpected widening of the deficit had sent the dollar 
reeling and pushed the dow jones average down by 101 points its 
fifthworst loss ever 
the monthly trade deficit has become the most closely watched 
barometer of us economic health 
a narrowing of the deficit is seen as a sign of strength for the 
american economy because it means more jobs in the manufacturing 
sector 
additionally smaller deficits usually translate into less 
downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
which is also important for the country since sharp declines in the 
dollar can send stock and bond markets tumbling because of investor 
fears that inflation will rise 
the 2897 billion in exports sold represented a 54 billion 
increase from the february level reflecting gains in sales of us 
machinery computers aircraft chemicals and telecommunications 
equipment in addition 600 million of the increase came in gold 
sales to taiwan 
the 13 billion rise in imports to 3872 billion reflected a 
small rise in imports of manufactured goods which offset a decline 
in oil imports which fell 152 percent 
for the first three months of the year the trade deficit has 
totaled 3601 billion which translates into an annual deficit of 
144 billion if that pattern holds for the entire year it would 
represent a substantial improvement from the record 1987 trade 
deficit of 17122 billion 
as usual the trade deficit with japan was the largest of any 
country an imbalance of 455 billion the deficit with canada 
americas largest trading partner was 114 billion 
the reagan administration was particularly embarrassed by the 
sharp deterioration in the february deficit and the turmoil it 
caused on financial markets 
that was because the february trade report issued on april 14 
came only a day after the united states and the six other biggest 
industrial countries had reaffirmed their pledge to keep the value 
of the dollar stable 
the finance ministers in washington for the annual spring 
meetings of the international monetary fund had to scramble to 
make good on that pledge conducting hurried meetings to plot a 
rescue effort through joint intervention 
intervention is the process by which governments buy a currency 
on the open market to support its value while the intervention 
succeeded it cost the united states and its allies an estimated 
700 million in dollar purchases 
the trade deficit has become closely linked to the value of the 
dollar a higher deficit convinces financial markets that the value 
of the dollar will have to fall further to produce improvement by 
making the value of exports cheaper and imports more expensive 
everybody has said that until the merchandise trade deficit 
starts to shrink the dollar will keep falling said cynthia 
latta an economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
ms latta said this conventional wisdom may be wrong however 
she said she believes the dollar which has been declining since 
march 1985 has finally hit a level which will insure that the 
trade deficit will begin to improve 
last year the united states ran a merchandise trade deficit of 
a record 1712 billion some analysts believe that imbalance will 
improve to around 150 billion this year

business leaders have called on the 
government to renegotiate the repayment terms on the nations 32 
billion foreign debt to ease a liquidity crisis caused by low oil 
prices 
the proposal for more just treatment by the nations 
creditors was discussed in a cabinet meeting tuesday 
hugo fonseca viso president of the national federation of 
chambers of commerce and industry the nations leading business 
organization met with president jaime lusinchi monday to discuss 
the proposal 
it is necessary for the nation to propose that the weight on 
venezuelas economy and finances of the foreign debt be 
reconsidered fonseca said following his meeting with lusinchi 
the newspaper el nacional reported tuesday 
we believe that international banks have not been just with 
venezuela taking into consideration how it has fulfilled its 
obligations we ask not for privileged treatment but at least for 
the same treatment given to other latin american nations fonseca 
said 
venezuela is the only major latin debtor that has been paying 
principal as well as interest on its foreign debt since 1982 it 
has reduced its debt by around 3 billion without receiving new 
loans to pay the old debts 
in the first quarter venezuela ran a balance of payments deficit 
of 850 million as low oil prices yielded income too low to pay for 
both 17 billion of imports and foreign debt service of 13 
billion 
the balance of payments deficit for all of 1987 was 12 billion 
the governments response has been to squeeze imports further 
and restrict liquidity in an effort to contain inflation 
about 20 billion of public sector debt is included in a 14year 
refinancing agreement that requires the nation to pay 400 million 
in principal this year private firms owe around 7 billion abroad

goodyear tire amp rubber co and the united 
rubber workers reached a tentative threeyear contract settlement 
today averting a strike scheduled for noon a union leader said 
union president milan stone said the agreement calls for an 
immediate 25cent hourly raise which will be deducted from any 
costofliving increases the workers would have received in july 
october and january 1989 the pact also allows for a wage reopener 
in march 1990 depending on goodyears financial situation 
stone said goodyear agreed to keep a provision that all union 
locals are required to approve midcontract wage concessions sought 
at any single local 
were hopeful that it will be ratified said stone im 
sure they were looking for more im convinced that there isnt any 
more and they should ratify this 
its a good agreement and we always would like to have more 
on a contract settlement obviously but i think we have to 
recognize the problems that financier sir james goldsmith has put 
upon this company and ultimately puts upon the workers in a company 
thats had to undergo such a corporate takeover attempt 
goodyear fended off a takeover attempt by goldsmith in the fall 
1986 by purchasing the 11 percent share he had acquired in the 
akronbased company 
goodyear spokesman fred haymond said the company would have no 
immediate comment but would release a statement later today 
on average rubber workers make about 14 an hour 
the union postponed its strike deadline until a week from today 
while another ratification vote is taken 
the urw represents 15000 workers at 11 goodyear locals covered 
by a master contract 
the two sides began meeting this morning at a downtown hotel 
meantime about 4700 firestone workers began a third day on 
strike today with no talks planned 
the union last went on strike against goodyear in 1976 in an 
industrywide walkout that lasted four months 
both parties traditionally have been willing to work up to the 
last minute to avoid strikes that create hardships for employees 
and affect the companys competitive position goodyear officials 
said well do our best to resolve our differences 
six of the goodyear locals had approved a tentative agreement 
although it was rejected nationally urw president milan stone 
supported the tentative agreement designed to set an industry 
pattern 
the agreement contained no pay increase instead concentrating 
on job security improvements costofliving allowances and 
pension and health insurance benefits 
in lincoln neb union leaders decided that goodyear workers 
will stay on the job according to lee domeier urw local 286 vice 
president the locals bargaining committee and executive board 
unanimously approved the decision to keep working he said 
in akron members of urw local 2 which previously approved the 
contract by a 31 ratio voted 722691 in favor of striking today 
bill breslin the locals president had urged the locals members 
to keep working despite the strike deadline after the vote 
breslin said he would resign his post 
besides akron and lincoln the goodyear locals facing the strike 
deadline were in marysville and st marys ohio new bedford 
mass sun prairie wis topeka kan union city tenn 
danville va madisonville ky and gadsden ala 
the union struck firestone on sunday because the company failed 
to accept the goodyear pattern stone said firestone officials 
however said their latest offer was equal to the pattern 
the urw represents workers at firestone plants in noblesville 
ind des moines iowa decatur ill russellville ark and 
oklahoma city as well as maintenance workers and technicians in 
akron 
one of the nations big three tire makers uniroyal goodrich 
tire co came to terms in midapril in a contract taking into

the manufacturer of the copper7 
intrauterine device displayed corporate irresponsibility by 
withholding knowledge about the devices potential for causing 
infertility an attorney for a woman suing gd searle amp co said 
today 
its a story of a company closing the door on the godgiven 
right of a woman to bear children attorney michael ciresi told a 
federal jury in his 1hour opening statement 
ciresi one of a team of attorneys from the minneapolis law firm 
of robins zelle larson amp kaplan said he will introduce evidence 
showing that searle changed the string on its copper7 iud 
stretching it which weakened it horizontally 
after the copper7 was approved by the us food and drug 
administration in 1974 searle sold between 300000 and 400000 of 
the iuds in the united states annually it was taken off the us 
market in 1986 
searle has denied that its iud caused any injury opening 
arguments by attorney for searle were to follow ciresis remarks 
today 
a jury of five women and three men including two undesignated 
alternates was chosen monday to hear the civil suit brought by 
esther r kociemba 29 and her husband william of elk river 
the kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in 
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries mrs kociemba 
allegedly suffered as a result of using a copper7 iud for slightly 
less than 1 years in 1977 and 1978 
according to the suit mrs kociemba has experienced 
infertility illnesses and great pain suffering and mental 
anguish that have continued since she had the iud removed in 
november 1978 
during ciresis opening remarks today mrs kociemba often wiped 
tears from her eyes 
us district judge robert renner is presiding over the trial 
which is expected to last up to two months 
robins zelle which is representing more than 30 women in 
separate copper7 lawsuits also represented plaintiffs in earlier 
litigation against dalkon shield maker ah robins co settling 
198 cases for a total of 38 million 
another robins zelle attorney roger p brosnahan has said that 
evidence includes testimony of searle employees and former 
employees and internal company documents he said this is expected 
to set a foundation for lawsuits to be tried later 
in our judgment it will be the first real trial involving the 
copper7 brosnahan said 
searle won 14 of the earlier cases while one of the cases it 
lost is on appeal 
kay bruno spokeswoman for skokie illbased searle said the 
company doesnt view the kociemba suit as much different from 
earlier ones many of the documents have been used in previous 
court cases she said 
more than 800 lawsuits involving the iud have been filed against 
searle bruno said of those many have been settled out of court 
she said about 500 lawsuits are pending 
searle withdrew the copper7 and its other iud the tatumt 
from the us market and stopped manufacturing the two items in 
january 1986 citing the cost of litigation and the unavailability 
of liability insurance the birth control devices remain available 
in foreign countries 
since removal of the copper7 from the us market only one 
iud the progestasert has been available in this country although 
it is not widely marketed but a new copper iud has been approved 
for sale and soon will be available 
according to a 1982 survey the most recent available 73 
percent of women using contraceptives chose the iud the study by 
the national center for health statistics showed the majority of 
women using an iud for birth control were over 25 years old and had 
at least one child

prices finished higher on londons stock exchange 
tuesday helped by a narrowerthanexpected us trade deficit for 
march 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index closed up 
126 points or 07 percent at 17892 
volume was a healthy 4259 million shares compared with 
mondays 3117 million shares 
the london equity market was boosted at midday by news that the 
bank of england had signaled a cut in the commercial banks base 
lending rate to 75 percent from 8 percent 
but several traders said the market failed to capitalize on the 
rate cut as players quickly turned their attention to the us 
trade report 
the commerce department reported the march merchandise trade 
deficit narrowed to 97 billion from februarys 138 billion the 
markets had expected a deficit of 12 billion to 13 billion 
the 100stock index was up nearly 24 points immediately 
afterward but then proceeded to drift lower throughout the rest of 
the day 
a muted opening on wall street dampened enthusiasm in london 
dealers said 
the commerce department said that a large increase in exports 
reflected gains in manufactured goods shipments especially 
machinery computers and aircraft as well as increased shipments of 
gold 
a dealer said that exports were a little disturbing due to the 
rise in gold and aircraft which cant be sustained over many 
months 
but london market players also were heartened by the apparent 
end to a rift between prime minister margaret thatcher and 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson over exchange rate policy

a big drop in the trade deficit failed to 
generate much excitement today in the stock market where a rally 
quickly faded in another sign of postcrash investor apathy and 
growing fear of inflation 
the fact that it waned so quickly is disappointing to me 
said peter j dapuzzo manager of retail equities at shearson 
lehman hutton inc the psychology is negative and low one number 
isnt going to change that 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which rose about 
15 points at the opening on the trade news retreated by 2 pm edt 
to 201227 up 464 among broader market barometers the new york 
stock exchange composite index of all listed issues fell 017 to 
14604 on the american exchange the market value index fell 054 
to 29742 
advancing and declining issues were nearly even on the nyse 
with 714 up 651 down and 538 unchanged with two hours of trading 
left volume on the big board totaled 8008 million shares 
considered extremely slow 
the commerce department said the merchandise trade deficit 
shrank to 97 billion in march a drop of more than 4 billion 
over the previous monthly deficit reflecting a 23 percent surge in 
exports to a record 2997 billion imports rose 36 percent to 
3872 billion 
the improvement was a major surprise driving the dollar sharply 
higher and initially boosting the bond market a sensitive economic 
barometer but bond prices later retreated and the stock market 
followed a reflection of the pessimism that has pervaded the 
securities industry since the oct 19 crash 
i havent seen this negative psychology for a long time 
said peter a karos manager of equity and overthecounter trading 
for the minneapolis investment firm piper jaffray amp hopwood inc

jc penney co inc dayton hudson corp and carter hawley hale 
stores inc reported tuesday that sluggish consumer has taken a 
toll on their earnings 
penneys income was up 141 percent from the first three months 
of 1987 when the company took a 140 million charge for the cost 
of relocating its headquarters to dallas from new york 
penney reported it earned 131 million or 96 cents per share 
in the quarter ended april 30 compared with 54 million or 36 
cents per share in the first quarter of last year 
however penneys income dipped slightly when compared with its 
yearearlier earnings before the 140 million charge penney earned 
136 million in the first three months of 1987 which translates 
into a 4 percent decline for the latest quarter 
the retailers sales declined to 317 billion from 322 
billion 
penney and other retailers suffered from sluggish consumer 
spending that has continued from 1987 into the first part of this 
year apparel retailers including penney have been especially 
hardhit 
penney also cited other factors for its lackluster performance 
including higher expenses for selling and administrative operations 
and developmental costs from the companys video home shopping 
venture and interactive television program 
meanwhile dayton hudson said its firstquarter earnings tumbled 
more than 19 percent to 307 million or 36 cents per share from 
381 million or 39 cents per share in the first quarter of 1987 
sales for the quarter ended april 30 totaled 254 billion up 
from 215 billion a year ago 
dayton hudson chairman kenneth macke said soft sales put 
pressure on margins the profits on merchandise and contributed to 
the decline a drop in profits at the companys mervyns division 
which sells mostly apparel also was a factor in the dayton hudson 
decline 
carter hawley hale was another casualty of the sluggish retail 
environment the los angelesbased department store company 
reported it suffered a 44 million loss in its third quarter 
the retailer said the loss in the three months ended april 30 
compared with earnings of 77 million or 1 cent per share in the 
same period a year ago 
sales fel to 5461 million from 5637 million in the latest 
quarter 
the 1987 figures are restated to account for the sale of 
neimanmarcus group inc and other stores 
for the first nine months of the fiscal year carter hawley hale 
earned 166 million or 67 cents per share compared with a loss 
of 262000 in the yearearlier period 
sales for the ninemonth period totaled 202 billion compared 
with 227 billion a year earlier

stocks sagged today despite a sharply lower

an anemic postcrash market that shows little inclination to

intensified as investors grew concerned that the surprisingly small 
trade deficit of 97 billion for march was an abberation 
others worried that a record surge in exports provided further 
evidence of a rapidly growing economy and higher inflation which 
caused a big selloff in the bond market that spilled over into

the 97 billion march trade deficit reported by the commerce 
department down from a february imbalance of 138 billion was so 
unexpectedly low that some investors assumed the april number 
released next month would be much higher brokers said customers 
sold stock based on that assumption 
some said the explosive growth in exports contained in the march 
number added to growing fear in the financial markets that higher 
inflation is unavoidable that fear caused a bond market selloff 
that spilled into stocks 
many wall street professionals agreed that the reaction typified 
the investor cynicism and anemia that has afflicted the market 
since the october crash they also recalled that when the high 
february trade deficit was announced last month it contributed to 
a 101point selloff in the dow average

a record level of export sales gave the united 
states its lowest monthly trade deficit in three years in march 
the government said tuesday in a report that president reagan 
seized as rhetorical ammunition against the trade bill 
the commerce department reported that the deficit shrank 
dramatically in march to 97 billion a drop of 295 percent from 
the february imbalance of 138 billion statistics which sent the 
dollar soaring on world money markets 
the improvement came from a 23 percent surge in american 
exports which rose to an alltime high of 29 billion as demand 
for us machinery aircraft computers and chemicals picked up 
sharply this offset a smaller rise in imports which climbed 36 
percent to 387 billion 
a month ago the unexpectedly bad february trade deficit sent 
the dollar plunging in value and triggered a 101point drop in the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks the fifthworst loss on 
record 
the march report was good news for the dollar which rose 
sharply against other major currencies but the stock market and 
bond market were decidely less impressed 
the dow jones average closed down 2122 points and declining 
issues outnumbered advances by a nearly 21 margin on the new york 
stock exchange 
reagan fielding reporters questions during a brief appearance 
tuesday in the white house press room said the latest report is 
clear evidence that the trade balance is improving as our economy 
continues to grow 
reagan said his veto message to congress on the 1000page bill 
is currently under review and he expects to issue it within a 
couple of days 
but todays news emphasizes what we have been saying all 
along that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on 
trade or reducing incentives for free open markets or closing job 
opportunities the president said we want more jobs not 
less 
im ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work with the 
congress once again in crafting a trade bill that will continue 
this trend of more job creation and greater economic growth 
reagan said 
analysts said some investors are worried that the export boom 
will spark another round of inflation in the united states as 
factories many already operating at peak capacity begin to raise 
prices 
indeed the federal reserve board said in another economic 
report tuesday that american industry operated at an eightyear 
high of 827 percent of capacity in april a 03 percentage point 
rise from march 
the high operating rate was solid evidence of the boom in export 
sales economists said but they cautioned that the country is 
approaching a danger zone when tight labor markets begin pushing 
prices higher unemployment fell to a 14year low of 54 percent 
last month 
you would have to read the trade number as evidence supporting 
the view that wages and prices will be firming up and there will be 
further inflationary pressures later this year said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
some analysts said the dramatic improvement in the trade deficit 
made it all but certain that congress would not be able to come up 
with the twothirds majorities in each house to override the veto 
i think trade is now a dead issue politically said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co he said the new report 
showed that the administrations strategy of driving the dollar 
lower back in 1985 had proven successful although it had taken 
much longer than expected 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas said the onemonth trade 
improvement in march did not diminish the need for the trade bill 
on the presidents desk 
with all these monthly fluctuation the trade deficit is five 
times as high as it was when president reagan came into office and 
this is intolerable he said 
there were times last year too when the monthly trade deficit 
fell and the administration was quick to trumpet this as evidence 
that the trade problem had gone away wright added 
commerce secretary c william verity said the report showed that 
a decisive improvement in the trade balance is now under way 
he noted that the deficit for the first three months of the year 
was 20 percent below the highpoint for the deficit from july 
through september 1987 
for the first quarter of 1988 the trade deficit totaled 36 
billion which would translate into an annual shortfall of 144 
billion last year the merchandise trade deficit hit a record 
1712 billion that figure is expected to decline by about 20 
billion this year 
export growth is going to remain quite strong and will be the 
major influence on the economy in 1988 said jeanette garetty 
senior economist at the bank of america she predicted us exports 
would rise by 14 percent this year 
in march exports rose by 54 billion over the february level 
sales of americanmanufactured products soared by 233 percent 
reflecting strong demand for machinery computers aircraft and 
telecommunications equipment 
farm sales were up as well climbing 55 percent to 33 billion 
in march 
in addition 600 million of the export increase reflected sales 
of gold bullion to taiwan which has come under heavy pressure to 
reduce its large trade surplus with the united states 
the 13 billion rise in imports to 3872 billion reflected a 
small 08 percent increase in imports of manufactured goods 
including passenger cars which rose 28 percent to 398 billion 
this gain was offset by a 152 percent drop in oil imports they 
fell to a daily rate of 67 million barrels at a price of 1570 
per barrel down from imports of 8 million barrels in february at a 
price of 1642 per barrel 
as usual the trade deficit with japan was the largest of any 
country an imbalance of 455 billion up 03 percent from 
february but the deficits with other countries declined in march 
the trade deficit with canada americas largest trading 
partner was 114 billion in march down 217 percent from 
february the deficit with western europe fell to 911 million 
down a sharp 42 percent

reynolds amp reynolds co says it will cut 
about 10 percent of its computer division work force and refocus 
the marketing of its main computer products 
the company announced the elimination of 250 jobs on monday 
spokesman paul guthrie said the computer division employs about 
2200 nationwide 
another 60 jobs will depart with the leveraged buyout of 
reynolds moneylosing catalog sales operation for computer 
accessories and forms guthrie said he declined to disclose the 
terms of the buyout 
the daytonbased computer and business forms maker a fortune 
500 company said it wanted to concentrate on marketing and service 
of its industryleading automotive dealer computer systems 
orders for its auto dealer systems slowed late last year but 
rebounded in january reynolds president david r holmes said 
the cuts announced monday stem not only from poor financial 
performance but also from the maturing of several development 
projects the company indicated 
much of the computer work at auto dealers now is done on 
freestanding computers not online or in batch processing holmes 
said 
weve invested a large amount of resources in that product 
change and weve developed that product now so were able to do 
some realigning in that regard he said 
an interactive video customerassistance system for chrysler 
corp and a management system for large dealerships are among other 
projects nearing completion holmes said 
computer division earnings also were hurt by losses in the 
companys taxprocessing business the result of expenses to meet 
new changes in the tax code 
computer systems division sales for the six months ended march 
31 were up 137 percent to 119 million from the same period in 
1987 but profits dropped 13 percent to 40 million 
net income for the entire company increased about 30 percent to 
12 million largely because of reduced taxes and a tax accounting 
change on sales of 2899 million 
in its last fiscal year reynolds amp reynolds posted a profit of 
212 million on sales of 5627 million

international business machines corp is putting 
the squeeze on makers of personal computer clones that have not 
paid for patent licenses 
some companies could be forced to pay substantial retroactive 
royalty payments on their ibmcompatible personal computers 
to be consistent we are not going to enter into new patent 
licensing agreements with companies that refuse to recognize their 
liability to ibm for the use of ibm patents in their existing 
products spokesman michael starks said tuesday 
ibm said it will require companies to settle up their past 
royalties before they are allowed to license the patents required 
to make computers compatible with its new personal system2 line 
ibm could also pursue companies for retroactive payments even if 
they do not want to produce personal system2 clones starks said 
it appears that they are being a little overbearing said 
michael shane chairman of leading edge hardware products inc of 
canton mass which imports koreanmade personal computers 
this latest move certainly cant help the american consumer 
shane said he predicted it would increase prices and increase 
confusion 
shane said leading edge has no interest in building a personal 
system2 compatible computer in that case it would probably not be 
one of ibms first targets for royalty payments 
unaffected would be companies such as tandy corp and compaq 
computer corp that have crosslicensing agreements with ibm under 
those agreements the companies allow each other to use certain of 
their patents without charge 
starks said the company would accept payments totaling 1 percent 
of sales on computers sold through this past april 1 assuming the 
companies settle up with ibm by the end of 1988 after that the 
fee could rise 
ibm stated recently that license fees related to its new ps2 
line could range as high as 5 percent of sales ibm says that 
license fees on clones of its old line of pcs could also range as 
high as 5 percent of sales for computers sold after this past april 
1 
ibms failure to demand license fees until now could give 
competitors some legal grounds to argue that it is too late for ibm 
to start now starks declined to comment on that possibility but 
said depending on the circumstances we may be in a position to 
ask for payments

demand despite indications that supplies will be rising soon 
on other markets precious metals futures were mixed orange 
juice futures plunged grains and soybeans livestock and meat and 
energy futures all were mixed and stockindex futures fell 
after reaching an alltime high of 146 as pound at the end of 
1987 copper futures have traded in a range from about 85 cents a 
pound to about 105 a pound 
copper for may delivery settled 27 cents higher tuesday at 
103 a pound on the commodity exchange in new york 
every time the market dips the trade buys it said john 
oconnell metals analyst in new york with refco inc 
coppers steep increase last year stemmed from a shortage 
although the market remains fairly tight an increase in readily 
available supplies now allows for more price elasticity analysts 
said 
richard levine vice president of precious metals and foreign 
exchange at elders futures inc in new york said he expected 
copper prices to continue hovering within the current range 
copper above 1 is just too high given the amount of 
production capability and below 85 cents is too low to warrant the 
production to come out he said but anywhere in the 90 cents 
to 1 range is safe territory its a reasonable price to pay if 
youre a buyer and a reasonable price to receive if youre a 
seller 
also on the commodity exchange gold futures finished slightly 
higher while silver futures posted modest losses 
gold initially fell in reaction to a government report showing a 
dramatic narrowing of the us trade deficit then recovered on 
ideas that an increase in manufacturing activity would ultimately 
prove inflationary levine said

troy ounce silver was 4 cents to 45 cents lower with may at 654 
a troy ounce

the may contract analysts said

winter garden citrus products fueled further selling said sandra 
kaul an analyst in new york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
orange juice futures have climbed from about 130 a pound last 
fall to around 170 a pound but a recent decline in wholesale 
sales of orange juice indicates falling demand due to high prices 
analysts said 
orange juice settled 2 cents to 65 cents lower with may at 
16715 a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the chicago board of 
trade amid conflicting forecasts for midwestern crop weather

restrained by soybean oil which faced weak cash markets and slack 
demand analysts said 
but weatherwatchers dominated the trade said richard loewy 
senior grain and oilseed analyst for prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
we had a twosided affair because rain was being forecast by 
some meteorologists in contrast to earlier predictions for hot 
dry weather until late in the week loewy said but the bulk of 
them are still looking hot and dry 
wheat settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with may at 318 a
