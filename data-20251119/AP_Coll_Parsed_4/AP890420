students chained themselves inside a college administration 
building in ohio and marched by the hundreds across other us 
campuses thursday as part of a nationwide call for improvements for 
black students 
the protests loosely organized as national black student action 
day were intended to publicize demands for black studies 
requirements more black faculty members and other remedies to what 
students say are persistent patterns of discrimination 
in ohio about 150 college of wooster students most of them 
white occupied the campus administration building galpin hall 
for 13 hours and chained themselves inside refusing to admit 
administrators 
the students left the building peacefully about 830 pm 
saying the school had met their demands to recruit and hire a black 
psychologist and counselor increase office space for the director 
of black student affairs and grant amnesty for the protesters 
school officials however did not meet their requests for more 
black faculty and an administrative push for a black studies 
requirement among other changes said a college spokesman jeff 
hanna 
it is necessary to recognize the fact that wooster is making 
needed strides toward diversity and a spirit of community the 
students said in a statement read by a spokesman mark goodman a 
junior from ann arbor mich 
earlier the protesters said they had been making no progress in 
talks with college president henry copeland and decided to occupy 
the building as the culmination of dissatisfaction with progress 
on our concerns by both blacks and whites 
at duke university at durham nc 65 students marched across 
campus but did not carry signs or banners 
our presence speaks for itself said chris foster vice 
chairman of the national association of black students for 
educational advancements the group that sponsored the nationwide 
protests 
the marchers stopped in front of the undergraduate financial aid 
office and chanted too black too strong three times before 
continuing the march across campus 
racism is deeply rooted in society and needs to be understood 
and change provost phillip griffiths said after receiving a list 
of the students demands we are committed to this process 
in texas about 35 white students and two professors at trinity 
university students joined 10 black students in a march thursday to 
protest of the san antonio schools minority recruitment record 
the protesters said there are 19 black students among the 2500 
trinity undergraduates the school says its figures show 24 black 
undergraduates 
officials at penn state university locked about 30 black 
students out of the administration building as they sought to get 
the schools response to demands made earlier this week 
for a university which is always saying the communication 
channels are always open this is a direct contradiction said 
cindy williams a student leader 
bill mahon a university spokesman told students crowded 
outside a door to the old main building several representatives of 
the group could go in the building to meet with administrators 
about 150 demonstrators at harvard university marched silently 
in doublefile across campus for a rally the students then 
delivered their specific demands to the administration including a 
better racial climate on campus more black faculty and more 
courses dealing with black issues 
we are invisible to the harvard administration because they 
have chosen to ignore our needs and concerns for hundreds of 
years said robert henry president of the harvardradcliffe 
black students association 
in detroit student demonstrators in their ninth day of 
occupying a wayne state university building were operating under a 
news blackout as negotiations with the administration continued 
earlier in the week the university gave in to some of the 
students demands including making the center for black studies a 
university department with its own professors and degree program 
in new york about 150 students presented a list of demands to 
the committee on ethnicity at barnard college then marched across 
the street to the colleges parent columbia university to present 
the same demands to the administration there according to barnard 
spokeswoman cathy cowhey 
the students want the university to divest itself of holdings in 
south africa as they promised four years ago and to stop 
their dehumanizing gentrification of black and latin communities 
weve done that already columbia spokeswoman judith leynse 
said of the divestment demands she refused to comment about the 
demand concerning gentrification

attempted assault 3 to 7 years for weapons possession and 3 to 
7 years for promoting prison contraband those sentences will run 
concurrently 
i think you thrive on attention vogt said why else would 
you plunge an 11inch knife into the chest of a young man who did 
you no harm who you didnt even know 
you should never be turned loose on society vogt said 
adding that bosket would remain a threat even while imprisoned 
im sending an innocent person to death because im sure 
youll kill someone in prison

i laugh at this court and the entire system ill 
haunt this system i am what this system created he said

novelist feodor dostoevski 
as he was being led out of the courthouse a reporter asked 
bosket if he would kill again bosket replied next time i will 
not try ill succeed 
at his trial in february bosket said his only regret was that

during robberies in new york city the case was a catalyst for

a usisraeli team with 
remotecontrolled yellow submarines the size of sea turtles is 
searching the bottom of the sea of galilee for underwater salt 
wells 
but they also have taken the time to look for remnants of a 
battle between jews and romans in 67 ad when 6700 jews were 
believed to have been killed 
the submarines were brought to israel by us marine scientists 
its the first time we can see for ourselves what the bottom 
of the lake looks like said tom berman director of the kinneret 
laboratory for limnology on galilees northern shore kinneret is 
the hebrew name for the sea of galilee 
project director richard cooper a marine scientist from the 
university of connecticut said submarines are superior to divers 
because they go as deep as 1000 feet and more importanly in this 
case can stay under water for as long as 10 hours 
one recent day aboard the projects control boat anchored a 
little over a mile offshore cooper lowered one submarine equipped 
with a tv camera still camera and strobe light into the lake to 
look for salt water craters 
geologists biologists and marine scientists gathered around a 
small monitor on deck to analyze the tv cameras pictures from the 
rocky bed of the lake which about 140 feet at its deepest point 
the 64squaremile sea of galilee is about 700 feet below sea 
level and is israels major source of fresh water providing nearly 
onethird of the nations supply 
salt levels are now at an acceptable level but might increase if 
water levels drop because of scant rainfall berman said 
data collected by the submarines could help scientists lower the 
lakes salt levels by determining what activates the salt wells 
nobody understands the mechanisms whereby these salt sources 
begin to flow berman said 
scientists also got a closer look at a threefoothigh ridge on 
the lakes bottom indicating recent earthquake activity the sea 
of galilee is part of an active rift valley extending from the 
jordan valley and the dead sea to the red sea in the south 
the 15member crew of the control boat spent one day during the 
twoweek project looking for what they might find from the lake 
battle in 67 ad said shelley wachsmann inspector for underwater 
antiquities in the israel department of antiquities and museums 
the battle took place during the roman conquest of galilee when 
the romans overran the town of migdal on the western shore of the 
lake jews fled in boats the romans pursued them in hastily 
constructed rafts and killed about 6700 in the battle 
one could see the whole lake stained with blood and crammed 
with corpses for not one man escaped wrote the jewish historian 
and soldier flavius josephus who took part in the battle 
wachsmann said the submarines probed several areas in the 
northern part of the lake where initial research indicated boats 
from the battle might have sunk 
the submarines came up with nothing but wachsmann said they 
would be useful tools in future research 
the submarine project is part of a us national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration longterm study comparing large lakes 
around the world including lake victoria and lake malawi in africa 
and the great lakes in the united states 
the submarines are going back to the united states when the 
project ends but the scientists will return next year for further 
studies berman said

the norwegian national opera wants to reach 
a wider audience so its staging the barber of seville as a 
drivein movie where motorists can toot for the tenor and feast on 
burgers and fries til the fat lady sings 
we were inspired by american drivein movies said opera 
spokesman terje baskerud it started as a wild idea but were 
going to try it 
the state opera hopes to convert downtown oslos youngstorget 
open market into a drivein for 200300 cars with a live broadcast 
on a giant tv screen of its sept 23 premiere of the barber of 
seville baskerud said in an interview 
we are arranging with local restaurants to serve food on trays 
that hang from car windows hopefully by waitresses on roller 
skates he said 
there wont be tinny incar speakers typical of us drivein 
movies but the music will be so loud that i dont think anyone 
in the area will have trouble hearing the performance he said 
they also hope to set up a 24squareyard screen 
police merchants and officials are intrigued by the notion of 
marrying 19th century opera to 1950s americana but olso residents 
are skeptical he said 
unfortunately we first announced it on april 1 on local 
radio everyone thought it was an april fools joke he said 
norwegians are wary of april 1 news because of the medias penchant 
for tricking them 
the state opera hopes the drivein will be free although its 
budget will not cover the costly performance without sponsors 
we havent worked out all the details yet said petter 
martin tanberg of the drammen advertising agency andersen and 
holter which was hired by the opera to handle sponsors and 
technical details 
its hard to say how much it will cost he said and reponse 
from sponsors has yet to be measured of course opera is a 
favorable thing for businesses to be associated with 
people think opera is a grim forum for tales of murder and 
betrayal baskerud said we want them to see that the barber of 
seville is not a serious piece its lively and funny he said 
the operas 200 regular performances a year held in a cramped 
former movie theater already average 90 percent bookings but 
manager bjoern simensen who is known for his unconventional 
approach to opera sees the onenight drivein scheme as an 
investment in the future 
its great for us to be seen and heard outside our traditional 
arena it would be deadly for us to isolate ourselves in our 
private fine arts ghetto he said 
the italianlanguage performance of rossinis barber of 
seville first sung in 1816 will be directed by michail hampe a 
cologne opera specialist in the works of rossini and conducted by 
italian carlo felice cillareo simensen said 
iziar martinez galdos will sing the female lead rosina and the 
scottish operas neill archer will sing almaviva with support from 
the norwegian operas 26 singers 42member chorus and 75piece 
orchestra baskerud said

government and install a marxist state the government says more

the bush administration plans to siphon off 
245 billion from profits of companies making ozonedepleting 
chemicals over the next three years a proposal that has infuriated 
the industry and may spark a fight in congress 
the administration wants the money but doesnt want to call its 
plan a tax 
but thats just what it sounds like to the largest manufacturer 
of chlorofluorocarbons du pont 
theyll be sued we will challenge it for sure said a 
company official tony vogelsberg 
the target for the revenue raising is windfall profits that 
chemical firms could earn after an international treaty reduces 
supplies of chlorofluorocarbons which destroy the ozone layer and 
increase risk of skin cancer 
rep john d dingell dmich chairman of the influential house 
energy and commerce committee says the administration has no 
specific authority to levy a tax on these commodities and 
cautioned against bypassing his committee or ignoring congress 
taxing authority 
dingell however indicated he hasnt formed a final opinion 
i dont have any dogs in the fight at this particular time he 
said 
to complicate matters the environmental protection agency and 
the office of management and budget are at odds over how to collect 
the money omb wants to auction off rights to produce a specific 
amount of cfcs epa favors a more straightforward fee on company 
profits 
omb has budgeted 400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990 15 
billion in 1991 and 550 million in 1992 the firstyear revenue 
figures survived an overall budget agreement between congressional 
negotiators and the administration 
both agencies agree however and the industry hotly denies 
that there will be windfall profits for manufacturers later this 
year after the us begins implementing a 1987 international 
agreement to cut production of the socalled cfcs 
the governments theory is that demand will far outstrip supply 
some months after july when production must be frozen at 1986 
levels the montreal protocol requires that by 1998 production can 
be only 50 percent of 1986 figures 
the five manufacturers of cfcs are developing substitutes but 
they are three to five years away from production epa spokesman 
chris rice said the companies may not hurry to produce them if 
theyre making windfall profits on current cfcs 
the companies will be making 20 percent less starting this 
year and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent rice said 
they can bring in an incredible amount of money were afraid 
they will have the incentive because of the profit to stall to 
delay introduction of the substitutes 
vogelsberg du ponts environmental manager for the freon 
production division said we dont see windfall profits as 
really being there 
if i say i have a monopoly position and im going to raise the 
price youre going to remember what i did to you i want to 
maintain a longterm business relationship we will not charge more 
than our cost justifies 
but vogelsberg whose company makes half the us supply of 
cfcs said producers will need more money to pay 2 billion to 3 
billion for new plants to make substitutes companies have large 
research and development costs he added 
cfcs manufactured by five companies are used in refrigerators 
large air conditioning units and car air conditioners high energy 
foam insulation for modern construction solvents for cleaning 
computer components and cushions in seats and sofas 
three companies also make ozonedepleting chemicals called 
halons including one firm that makes both chemicals which are 
used in firefighting equipment halon production will be frozen in 
1992 at 1986 levels 
bob thoma vice president of government relations for basf a 
foam insulation maker said a tax on manufacturers would find its 
way to consumers with disastrous consequences 
if you put a 2 per pound tax on roofing applications it 
would add 15000 for the cost of a roof he said you could 
use other materials that are less expensive but do not have the 
same insulation benefits 
the consequences of switching products are higher energy 
consumption including burning of coal and oil which causes 
greater degradation in the greenhouse effect global warming and 
acid rain 
smaller manufacturers of the insulation would go out of business 
and jobs would be lost thoma said 
we will get that 400 million somehow one way or another 
vowed omb spokeswoman barbara clay referring to the firstyear 
projected revenues you have to base the argument for windfall 
profits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreases 
and demand remains constant 
emissions from cfcs and halons are nontoxic when released into 
the atmosphere but 10 to 100 years later when they rise 1520 
miles to the stratosphere their chemical bonds break apart 
scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone allowing more 
of the suns ultraviolet rays to reach earth causing more skin 
cancer and eye cataracts and suppressing human immune systems

six of the seven people slain in a 
bloody rampage were laid to rest wednesday on a quiet green 
hillside in californias wine country and residents learned the 
prime suspect had been arrested in mexico 
this is a day of relief for sonoma county sheriff dick 
michaelsen said after ramon salcido bojorquez arrest early 
wednesday in sinaloa state about 850 miles north of mexico city 
us authorities hope to extradite salcido 28 who had been 
sought in an international manhunt since last fridays killing 
spree 
salcido is accused of killing his wife two daughters 
motherinlaw two sistersinlaw and a winery coworker 
five sonoma county detectives flew wednesday afternoon to mexico 
in a lear jet owned by peanuts cartoonist charles m schulz 
who lives in the county and piloted by his son craig michaelsen 
said 
salcido is accused of killing his wife two daughters 
motherinlaw two sistersinlaw and a winery coworker 
he told mexican police that he killed his wife angela and 
coworker tracy toovey because he suspected they were having an 
affair deputy attorney general javier coello tracy said in mexico 
salcidos arrest was reported wednesday morning as about 100 
people attended private funeral services for mrs salcido her 
daughters sofia 4 and teresa 1 her mother marian louise 
richards 47 and her two young daughters ruth 12 and marie 8 
the rev kenneth cabral of oakland a retired roman catholic 
priest who is a longtime friend of the richards officiated at 
services preceding burial in a large gravesite at calvary catholic 
cemetery 
cabral told mourners guarded by 20 sheriffs deputies death 
isnt the end after you die there are all kinds of beautiful 
things awaiting said judith kelly who was among the mourners 
one by one white caskets containing the childrens bodies and 
gray caskets with those of the adults were taken from a cemetery 
mausoleum to the burial site and lowered into the ground along with 
metal crucifixes and flowers 
immediately after the service ended angela salcidos father 
bob richards was told of salcidos arrest undersheriff gene fahy 
said 
richards then went to petaluma valley hospital to visit carmina 
salcido 2 carmina and her sisters throats were cut and they 
were abandoned at a dump 
kelly said the three richards sons who attended the funeral 
agreed they want carmina to live with a family member when she 
recovers 
the investigators on shultz plane were going to mexico to 
discuss extradition and other aspects of the case with mexican 
authorities 
although salcido became a permanent us resident in 1986 after 
marrying his wife he remains a mexican citizen said david 
ilchert district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service in san francisco 
that could help him avoid trial in the united states and a 
possible death sentence if convicted 
mexicos penal code provides that mexican citizens can be tried 
there for crimes committed elsewhere but that country does not 
have a death penalty 
fbi agent mike dooher said he was confident salcido would be 
returned to the united states regardless of his status 
but sonoma county district attorney gene tunney said he had 
tried unsuccessfully on two previous occasions to extradite mexican 
citizens on county murder charges 
of course wed rather prosecute him salcido here said 
tunney if there was ever a death penalty case this is it 
but i would rather have him prosecuted in mexico under their 
law instead of having him go free

an amateur historian says he is yielding to 
pressure from italianamerican groups and dropping efforts to have 
gangster al capones old house listed on the national register of 
historic places 
i still think the house has tremendous historical interest 
but i have no intention of offending anyone and some people left 
me no doubt that they quite clearly are offended by it mark 
levell said wednesday 
levell a computer repairman took up the cause of having the 
privately owned house placed on the register in january after 
requests from others were rejected by the chicago landmarks 
commission and the illinois historic sites council 
his appeal of those rejections went all the way to the national 
register 
on the way however levells appeal drew the wrath of the joint 
civic committee of italianamericans and the chicago suntimes as 
well as the park manor neighborhood council which represents 
residents of the south side neighborhood where the house is located 
the neighborhood council complained that placing the modest 
twostory brick house on the register might draw additional 
unwanted tourism to park manor which is already visited on a 
regular basis by gangstertheme bus tours 
the newspaper complained that emphasizing 1920s gangster lore 
does little for the citys image and the italianamerican group 
objected to continuation of the italian gangster stereotype 
they complained that i was trying to honor a notorious 
criminal but i never said anything about honor levell said 
the prohibition gangsters were part of this citys history 
thats all they were colorful men but i never suggested them as 
role models for anyone 
levells decision to withdraw the appeal was hailed by robert 
allegrini executive director of the italianamerican committee 
who said he was glad levell had come to understand the sensitivity 
of lawabiding italianamericans to depiction of their ethnic group 
as mobsters 
im half italian myself said levell the italian half of 
me says one thing but the historian half of me says this is 
history 
levell said capone lived in the house from 1920 to 1928 but 
later moved into the lexington hotel for security reasons he said 
capones mother and several of his brothers remained in the house 
after scarface moved out

senators threatened with a disrupted vacation 
overwhelmingly adopted president bushs savings and loan rescue 
after bowing to a lastminute plea to strengthen a key reform 
dwarfing all other government bailouts the plan approved 
wednesday would provide at least 157 billion over the next decade 
most of it from taxpayers to close or merge 350 failed thrift 
institutions and make good on government pledges in the rescue of 
200 others last year 
it would also reorganize the regulatory bureaucracy provide 50 
million a year for the justice department to pursue fraud in sampls 
and enact other reforms chief among them a requirement that thrift 
owners back their lending with more of their own capital 
the ultimate passage of the bill was never in doubt but sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio was threatening to prolong debate 
which began monday into the weekend unless senators agreed to 
tougher capital requirements 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking committee and sen jake garn of utah the panels senior 
republican had been resisting amendments arguing that the package 
put together privately by the committee and endorsed by a 210 vote 
last week was too delicately balanced to withstand many changes 
without crumbling 
but only five minutes before the scheduled start of an 11day 
recess metzenbaum succeeded in wresting concessions that allowed 
senators to adopt the bill 918 and leave town until may 1 
the committees bill had doubled capital standards requiring 
sampl owners to come up with 6 for every 100 in lending compared 
with the current requirement of 3 
however it provided a big loophole for about a third of the 
nations 3000 sampls by allowing an accounting item known as good 
will to be counted as capital for the next 25 years good will 
represents the value of an institutions customer loyalty and other 
intangible assets 
declaring that goodwill isnt worth doodlydoo metzenbaum 
insisted that sampls have at least 15 percent in tangible capital 
cash stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash 
and could be seized in the event of a failure before turning to 
government deposit insurance funds 
metzenbaum had sought 3 percent tangible capital but in the end 
had to accept 15 percent regulators will have the authority to 
restrict the growth of institutions falling below that level 
i cant say im satisfied with the result that has been 
obtained i can say substantive progress has been made 
metzenbaum said 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady praised the bill saying 
we applaud the senates efforts to maintain strong capital 
requirements 
metzenbaum was urged on by two groups consumer federation of 
america and consumers union that decided to emphasize capital as 
an important consumer issue 
i never thought hed get that everybody is shocked 
said peggy miller a lobbyist for the consumer federation the 
groups are hoping the metzenbaum victory will lend momentum to 
their fight to toughen the house version of the sampl bill 
the house banking subcommittee on financial institutions passed 
a similar 15 percent standard last week and rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas chairman of the full committee says he will try 
to increase that when his panel begins redrafting the legislation 
next wednesday 
he wants the full house to vote by the end of may sending a 
bill to the presidents desk in june following a housesenate 
conference 
another metzenbaum amendment will require federal regulators to 
review last years sampl bailouts possibly renegotiating the deals 
to reduce the governments costs 
the senate also adopted by voice vote an amendment from sen 
frank murkowski ralaska which would require ailing banks and 
sampls to obtain advance permission from regulators before raising 
highcost deposits through money brokers 
on a 6138 vote senators rejected an effort by sen bob graham 
dfla to force the top sampl regulator federal home loan bank 
board chairman m danny wall to undergo reconfirmation by the 
senate 
the bill as passed guarantees walls job through june 1991 
graham said he faults wall for underplaying the sampl crisis in the 
months before last years presidential election 
riegle lost a fight on how to fund the bailout the bill creates 
a new quasipublic agency allowing the government to borrow 50 
billion without counting it toward the budget deficit 
riegle said taxpayers would have saved 45 billion in lower 
interest rates over 30 years if the 50 billion was borrowed 
through the treasury however his plan would have ballooned the 
1989 budget deficit to within range of the alltime high of 221 
billion set in 1986 
on passage of the bill by the senate all the no votes were cast 
by democrats sens max baucus of montana bill bradley of new 
jersey kent conrad of north dakota james exon of nebraska ernest 
f hollings of south carolina bob kerrey of nebraska metzenbaum 
and david pryor of arkansas sen albert gore jr dtenn did not

congress is beginning work on the 1990 budget 
in uncharacteristic bipartisan spirit but with top senators 
conceding their spending plan is only a first step that leaves 
deeper cuts to the future 
on a 167 vote the senate budget committee approved a 116 
trillion blueprint for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 a 
document implementing the deficitreduction pact reached last week 
between the bush administration and congressional leaders nine 
democrats and seven republicans supported the proposal 
the plan touts enough cuts to bring next years deficit to 994 
billion less than the grammrudman laws 100 billion ceiling 
critics say the savings are insufficient and illusory relying on 
overly rosey predictions of economic performance and onetime 
savings like sales of federal assets 
many leading budget writers defend the agreement saying it will 
prepare them for the far more difficult task of coming up with a 
1991 budget when the law requires a shortfall of no greater than 
64 billion 
but before that will come the struggle by congressional tax 
committees to find 53 billion in new taxes bush has championed a 
reduction in the capital gains tax that he says will raise revenue 
by stimulating the economy democrats have opposed the idea 
calling it a moneyloser that benefits mainly the wealthy 
another 57 billion will have to come from sales of assets 
the chairman of the senate budget panel jim sasser dtenn 
noted that the 1990 spending plan sets the precedent of putting 
everything domestic and defense programs and revenue sources 
on the table in future budget talks 
the budget committees ranking republican pete domenici 
rnm also defended the 1990 spending plan by saying it paves the 
way for work on savings in 1991 it is not the best budget but 
it is an acceptable workable budget and is better than any 
alternative he said 
the 1990 spending blueprint would allow 2992 billion in 
spending for defense programs next year a 48 billion cut in the 
amount bush proposed in the budget he presented congress in 
february 
but none of the 20 other spending categories into which the 
budget is divided were treated as harshly and several came out as 
winners 
spending for science and space programs would reach 14 billion 
a 400 million increase above the rate of inflation education and 
employment programs would grow 300 million to 387 billion and 
law enforcement driven largely by congress desire to finance 
antidrug efforts would reach 102 billion a 200 million 
increase 
big savings would come from medicare the health program for the 
elderly and handicapped which would be trimmed by 26 billion to 
1224 billion lawmakers expect the savings to come from 
reductions in payments to doctors and hospitals 
agriculture spending would drop 2 billion to 15 billion 
environmental programs would be cut 700 million to 174 billion 
and veterans programs would lose 700 million for a total of 298 
billion 
housing and commerce programs would be slashed 22 billion to 
181 billion but 18 billion of the drop would be a result of a 
paper shift of the postal service to an offbudget account 
as provided in the budget agreement announced last friday there 
would be 19 billion in new spending for international affairs 
by a 127 vote the panel rejected an amendment by sen kent 
conrad dnd that would have sent the congressional and 
administration negotiators back to the table to seek deeper 
savings and on a 1210 vote they defeated a move by sen ernest 
hollings dsc that would have imposed 46 billion in deficit 
reductions 
the full senate is expected to consider the budget resolution 
when it returns in early may from its april recess the house 
budget committee plans to write its own version of the budget next 
week 
after congressional passage of a budget resolution more than a 
dozen laws will be needed to implement the spending and taxing 
decisions it makes

an agriculture department economist says 
consumer food prices are rising a bit faster than he and other 
experts had expected and that a revised forecast may be in the 
works 
ralph parlett of the departments economic research service said 
wednesday that price figures for the first three months of 1989 
showed a number of major food items gained more than had been 
projected earlier including higher prices for fresh vegetables 
eggs beef and fish 
i think its likely that the 1989 forecast will be revised 
upward but how far i dont care to speculate just now he said 
the labor departments consumer price index showed tuesday that 
higher food and energy costs boosted prices 05 percent in march 
that resulted in a 61 percent annual inflation rate for the first 
three months of 1989 the biggest quarterly rise in two years 
since last fall the usda has forecast that 1989 retail food 
prices would gain 3 percent to 5 percent an average for the entire 
12 months of the year the increase was 41 percent in 1988 the 
same as in 1987 
parlett said in a telephone interview that the current forecast 
still stands but that he and other economists are reviewing the 
situation and that we might be looking at revising it in another 
month or so 
many factors that are uncertain now will begin to unfold more 
clearly in the next few weeks he said moisture conditions in some 
of the major agricultural areas including parts of the great 
plains are still critical and will have a lot to do with livestock 
grazing and production later in the year 
however parlett said he believes that we ought to start 
getting some sort of moderation in consumer food prices in the 
near future barring a total upset 
part of the problem in the first quarter was fresh vegetables 
for example he said now were coming into the season where 
fresh vegetable prices will start to fall 
egg prices which have risen and then declined erratically for 
months may ease lower again and then level off he said last 
years big cutbacks in laying hen flocks because of low profits 
have been the main factor in the rise in egg prices 
the biggest factor in consumer food prices is the livestock 
sector the beef pork and poultry that add up to so much of family 
grocery spending parlett said and those items weigh most heavily 
in the governments food price estimates 
a report later wednesday by parletts agency said that farmers 
intend to boost crop plantings for the 1989 harvest most of those 
crops are being planted this spring for harvest in the fall an 
exception is winter wheat which was planted last fall and some of 
it is doing poorly 
by midapril 76 percent of the kansas winter wheat crop was 
rated poor or very poor reflecting ongoing drought wind damage 
and winterkill the report said kansas usually produces about 
17 percent of all us wheat 
the report said the net cash income of farmers in 1989 is 
expected to be in the range of 48 billion to 52 billion down 
from last years record of 58 billion 
net cash income is the amount farmers have available to spend 
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses for example despite last years drought 
1988 sales of grain stored from previous harvests were counted as 
part of the years gross 
this years net cash income is expected to decline partly 
because farmers will have larger expenses as they expand crop 
acreages and also because federal subsidies will be lower

a monthly report by the agriculture department 
says the outlook for summer water supplies improved in the pacific 
northwest in march but declined in the southwest because of 
belowaverage rainfall and early snowmelt 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said wednesday there was some muchneeded moisture in 
march but a good share of the west could use another month just 
like it to make up for previous dry spells 
most of the northwestern states received 120 percent or more of 
their average monthly precipitation in march he said that 
improved stream flow forecasts for washington idaho montana 
northern california northern nevada northern wyoming and the utah 
panhandle 
but the rest of the western states received belowaverage 
precipitation in most areas and warm weather during march further 
reduced the snowpack 
the situation for water reserves stored in reservoirs looks 
generally disappointing except in parts of the southwest 
reservoir storage continues well below average in most western 
states due to the drought scaling said it ranges from near 
average in utah and oregon to 61 percent below average in nevada 
aboveaverage runoff in recent years has left new mexicos 
reservoirs full and current storage of water is 120 percent above 
average he said arizona is 13 percent above average and 
colorado 31 percent above 
snowmelt provides about 75 percent of the western water supply 
including irrigation for farm crops

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
federal government can compensate for any changes in american farm 
policy recommended by negotiators at international trade talks 
responding to questioning before the senate agriculture 
committee yeutter said wednesday that the point of the trade talks 
is for all countries to remove subsidies that distort the 
international marketplace 
he said the united states can accommodate domestically for those 
changes 
nothing precludes the senate agriculture committee from making 
the farmers whole you just have to do it in a way that is not 
trade distorting he said 
sen kent conrad dnd brought up the subject saying farmers 
from his state were worried they would suffer 
no one is suggesting that we not be part of the 
negotiations he said but there is a tension that exists 
between being part of negotiations and having our position be 
determined by a relatively few number of people 
there is a sense that if the negotiators get their way our 
producers will be hurt 
yeutter said trade distorting subsidies are a global problem 
that will require adjustments by all countries 
he sought to allay fears that us farm policy was going to be 
dictated by the uruguay round in geneva but said it would be naive 
to think it should not be affected 
if the geneva negotiations are successful well be writing a 
segment of the european communitys 1991 farm bill he said 
well also be writing a major segment of the farm bills of 
canada brazil argentina australia and several other countries 
if we wish to have an impact on those farm bills it would be 
unrealistic to expect the negotiations to have no effect on our own 
legislation 
the discussion over the trade talks developed during a hearing 
on the 1990 farm bill which will determine the governments 
overall policy toward agriculture for several years 
the international trade talks are not expected to be complete 
until 1991 but congress can extend the 1985 law until the talks 
are finished or write a new law that would be amended after the 
negotiations 
sen patrick leahy dvt who chairs the agriculture committee 
said congress intends to go ahead with a new longterm farm bill 
we cant forget that there are a number of issues covered by 
the farm bill that are affected only indirectly or not at all by 
the gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade negotiations 
he said 
yeutter agreed it would be in the best interests of the 
nontrade portions of the law to go ahead with new legislation 
his suggestions for the new farm bill included 
making programs more flexible so farmers have more control over 
what they plant and how they use their acreage 
changing target price relationships to prevent farmers from 
producing for governmentfinanced storage 
limiting or eliminating large annual acreage reduction programs 
simplifying price and income support programs and 
devoting more attention to environmental and food safety 
concerns 
he said he wanted to find out if there was a feasible way to 
pinpoint income supports with greater precision than in the past 
and avoid the costs of having both crop insurance and emergency 
disaster relief programs 
if crop insurance has shortcomings and i believe it does 
lets try to fix them in the 1990 farm bill or through separate 
legislation he said

a coalition of recording film book and 
computer groups is targeting 12 nations where theft of copyright 
materials and restrictive trade barriers are costing us 
businesses an estimated 14 billion a year 
the international intellectual property alliance said wednesday 
it was urging the bush administration to maintain pressure on 
foreign governments to curtail this massive loss of us property 
the alliance said their 1600 member companies can only do so 
much against piracy that often is condoned by foreign governments 
and the us government must go to bat 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america told reporters his group was spending 40 million year to 
fight estimated losses of 1 billion annually from piracy and lack 
of market access 
there comes a time when youve done all you can do and you 
need the muscular arm of your government valenti said 
the first step has to be government concurred jay berman 
president of the recording industry association of america because 
in most cases piracy goes on with government condonement 
the alliance said us government intervention had helped cut by 
half the estimated 13 billion that was lost to pirates in 10 
nations in 1984 but problems remain and while one nation 
singapore has been dropped from that list three more were added 
in 1988 the peoples republic of china saudi arabia and india 
piracy losses totaled 418 million in china in 1988 189 
million in saudi arabia and 123 million in india the alliance 
said another 30 million was lost in india due to lack of access 
the group said 
in the 12 nations piracy still is costing us companies 13 
billion said eric smith general counsel to the alliance 
lack of access is costing american manufacturers an additional 
95 million for a total piracy and market access loss of about 
14 billion annually he said 
unless the 12 nations on the new list take meaningful measures 
to shape up they will be candidates for designation as a 
priority foreign country under the 1988 omnibus trade and 
competition act smith said 
that could mean the us trade representative could conduct a 
socalled section 301 trade investigation against these nations 
leading ultimately to trade actions if necessary smith said 
the 12 nations are china saudi arabia korea india the 
philippines taiwan brazil egypt indonesia thailand nigeria 
and malaysia 
thanks to us government pressure piracy in indonesia dropped 
from 206 million to 45 million in the fouryear period while 
piracy declined in nigeria from 131 million to 22 million in the 
period the alliance said 
berman said that in recordings alone piracy dropped from 400 
million in 1984 to just 1 million in 1988 in singapore and 
indonesia 
the leverage provided by the 301 process has encouraged 
countries to give attention to this problem smith said 
nicholas veliotas president of the association of american 
publishers said the international trade commission had estimated 
that total losses of intellectual property to the united states 
such as patents copyrights and trade secrets ranged from 60 
billion to 100 billion a year 
ronald palenski general counsel of the computer software and 
services industry association said theft of computer software was 
a particular problem in china in the hydroelectric and 
manufacturing industries 
palenski said he didnt know if any of the pirated software had 
military applications but the piracy was done with the knowledge 
of the beijing government 
i wouldnt call it government sponsored but its condoned 
palenski said 
smith said the loss figures were compiled from industry surveys

municipal leaders want to change their 
towns queen city nickname to superior location because 
they think the current moniker might be misinterpreted 
it has come to my attention that there has been a resurgence 
of the use of the phrase queen city to describe the city of 
marquette city manager david svanda said in a recent letter to 
community leaders 
the terms negative connotations conjured by many people do 
not give justice to all that the marquette area has to offer 
visitors might think queen city refers to homosexuals said 
mayor robert berube 
marquette historian fred rydholm who is writing a history of 
the lake superior port of 23280 people said that was silly 
svandas request is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard 
rydholm said 
the queen city nickname originated after a 1868 fire when an 
ordinance required all buildings in the center city area to be 
rebuilt with stone or masonry he said 
visitors expecting to see the wood construction of other upper 
peninsula towns in michigan instead were greeted with tall spires 
of stone 
there was nothing from seattle to buffalo like it in the 
north and it was also the best port on lake superior so it was 
called the queen city of the north rydholm said

adnan khashoggis jail cell is only a fiveminute 
walk from the luxury hotel where the jetsetting saudi financier 
and arms dealer was staying before his arrest 
although the conditions are better than in many other swiss 
jails they are far being from the plush surroundings to which he 
is accustomed 
khashoggi once reputed to be among the worlds richest men 
does not have to wear prison clothes and can order out for meals 
some of which he has had delivered from the schweizerhof hotel 
he was staying at the hotel in bern the swiss capital when he 
was arrested tuesday on a us warrant charging he helped ousted 
philippine president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda hide 
riches stolen from their country 
the 54yearold khashoggi was allegedly the main middleman and 
financier in the irancontra affair and has been involved in 
several kickback scandals but this is the first time hes been 
arrested 
he has been held in a downtown bern jail reserved for people in 
pretrial protective custody 
like most prisoners there he has a room to himself it measures 
about 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed table chair 
sink and toilet 
all the furniture is bolted down said bern investigating 
magistrate alexander tschappat 
a radio is in the room and khashoggi can rent a television for 
one franc about 60 cents a day 
he can also read and write and buy newspapers but he cant 
have technical things like a telephone tschappat said 
khashoggi is not receiving special treatment tschappat said in 
a telephone interview 
he said all prisoners could keep their watches and other 
personal belongings with them such as family photos but you 
usually deposit all your valuables so there is no danger of 
something being stolen 
inmates can receive visitors three days a week for two hours in 
the afternoon tschappat said 
he said prisoners can exercise regularly though the prison is 
not a big place you cant play tennis or anything 
the prison holds about 110 inmates and is usually fully 
booked he said 
swiss legal sources said wednesday that khashoggi likely will 
have to stay in jail until the justice ministry rules on an 
extradition request that united states has said it would file 
within 60 days 
if the swiss approve the demand khashoggi can appeal to the 
federal tribunal switzerlands supreme court a process that could 
take months 
swiss law also allows him to turn himself over to us 
authorities before the extradition request arrives he could then 
seek release on bail in the united states 
but even then the united states would have to submit the 
extradition request for a ruling by swiss authorities it will be 
needed because switzerland does not allow extradited suspects to be 
tried abroad on charges not considered criminal under swiss law 
khashoggi is charged in a us indictment with racketeering 
conspiracy obstruction of justice and mail fraud by posing as the 
owner of some of the allegedly stolen philippine assets to protect 
them against possible seizure 
if convicted he could draw up to 65 years in prison

the worlds oceans and seas have been warming at 
about onefifth of a degree fahrenheit a year about twice as fast 
as previous observations indicated says a study published today 
the new work is based on satellite observations which provide 
more complete information than previous data from ships and buoys 
said researcher ae strong 
the increase in seasurface temperatures was observed from 
january 1982 to mid1988 strong reports in todays issue of the 
british journal nature 
the observed rate is faster than most scientists have expected 
from the greenhouse effect a predicted global warming due to 
buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere strong 
said in a telephone interview 
but it is premature to regard the findings as evidence of the 
greenhouse effect said strong a research oceanographer with the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration and currently a 
visiting scientist at the us naval academy in annapolis md 
the findings may reflect only a temporary change rather than the 
longterm warming predicted from the greenhouse effect he said 
researchers lack comparable satellite data from previous years for 
longerterm analysis he said 
the average water temperature actually dropped about ninetenths 
of a degree during 1988 but has risen about twofifths of a degree 
this year through march reaching a mark of about 66 degrees he 
said 
the averages were derived from some 2 million to 3 million 
satellite observations a month covering a global band that extends 
as far north as the southern tip of greenland and farther south 
than the tip of south america

a proposed ban on assault weapons sales took a 
small step forward in the senate as guncontrol forces put off 
difficult decisions that already have divided lawmakers 
the legislation will help prevent our law enforcement officers 
from being gunned down by drug dealers sen howard m 
metzenbaum dohio declared as a senate judiciary subcommittee 
cleared both his measure and a rival version 51 
the panels action which did not include a recommendation of 
approval places the issue before the full senate judiciary 
committee which is expected to take up the measures next month 
metzenbaums bill which has been modified somewhat over the 
last week would ban sales of new assault weapons but not transfers 
of ones that already are owned by the public it would require 
owners selling their guns to keep a record to make it easier to 
trace firearms found at crime scenes 
the measure also would require a 14day waiting period before 
transfers it specifies a list of 26 assault guns ranging from the 
aks a semiautomatic cousin of the soviet infantrymans ak47 to 
sinisterlooking street sweeper and striker 12 rounddrummed 
shotguns 
also approved by the panel was a rival version sponsored by sen 
dennis deconcini dariz that specifies nine guns the senator 
says are frequently used by narcotics gangs it does not include a 
waiting period for transfers 
in approving both bills without a recommendation the 
subcommittee on the constitution merely put off resolving the 
disputes between the two as well as the inevitable battle with 
forces opposed to any crackdown on assault weapons sen orrin 
hatch rutah vowed to introduce still another bill that would 
take the stress off of gun control and put the emphasis on crime 
control 
the only assault these socalled assault weapons bills make is 
on the legitimate lawabiding citizens hatch declared he said 
both measures would transgress the second amendment rights to 
bear arms guaranteed to all lawabiding citizens in our society 
defining assault weapons has posed a major problem for their 
critics but they generally are semiautomatic rifles and pistols 
with military styling as well as folding and plastic stocks 
forward hand grips and other features more often seen in rambo 
movies than in a traditional woodsmans gun rack 
crack gangs warring over turf have been using the rapidfiring 
highpowered weapons to spray street corners in some communities 
but authorities also say there is no functional difference between 
the assault rifles and the semiautomatic versions of traditional 
hunting rifles with their brown wooden stocks 
the national rifle association has been highly critical of 
metzenbaums bill and deconcini said he expected the same kind of 
opposition to his measure even though he has a strong progun 
voting record metzenbaum registered a strongly worded complaint 
against the power of gun groups 
as i know so well any legislative initiative dealing with 
firearms no matter how modest and reasonable is inevitably 
attacked by the gun lobby as a threat to sportsmen and legitimate 
gun owners he said i am sure sen deconcini will be attacked 
as well even though he has introduced a modest and careful 
measure 
lawmakers are also divided over whether they should await a cue 
from president bush before taking the next step 
i think we can make up our minds without hearing from 
president bush on this sen edward m kennedy dmass 
he urged speed saying that the american people want action 
we didnt have the guts to face up to the handguns and the 
issue of concealable guns and now the question is whether we are 
going to have the guts to face up to assault weapons he said 
deconcini and sen arlen specter rpa however said lawmakers 
should get bush administration input lest the president veto the 
finished product they said support to override a veto and pass 
such a bill over the presidents objections could well be missing 
if we dont think weve got the administrations support i 
dont think we can push a bill deconcini said 
the administration has banned imports of many assault weapons 
but many of them are made in america 
the treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms says that before bush imposed his temporary import ban 
foreignmade weapons accounted for about 25 percent of the american 
market

seeking 349 million in repayments as a result of the failure of 
two sampls 
the governments civil complaints seek to recoup the money from 
four brokerage firms including two of the nations largest 
shearson lehman hutton inc and prudentialbache securities 
the firms were accused of running up losses of at least 259 
million at two sampls in colorado and oklahoma that are now insolvent 
the government on wednesday accused the brokerage firms of using 
funds from the sampls to purchase highly speculative futures and 
options contracts 
the complaints involve the nowdefunct key savings and loan 
association of englewood colo and the former universal savings 
and loan association of chickasha okla the two institutions were 
declared insolvent and taken over by the government in february 
1987 
the complaints brought by the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp also named as defendants five commodity program 
salesmen who either now work or once worked for the firms 
fslic which insures sampl deposits up to 100000 has the task 
of trying to recoup costs incurred when an sampl fails 
federal officials have estimated that one in four sampl failures 
is the direct result of fraud but critics have charged that 
regulators have been slow to prosecute these cases 
president bush in announcing his sampl bailout plan in february 
promised to step up efforts to recover at least a portion of the 
billions of dollars that were embezzled or lost at failed sampls 
the senate approved its version of the sampl bailout package on 
wednesday a measure that provides 157 billion over the next two 
decades with twothirds of that coming from taxpayers 
the fslic actions filed over the past three weeks in federal 
courts in denver and oklahoma city and before the commodity futures 
trading commission were not announced until wednesday 
shearsonlehman was accused of involving key savings in a 
computerdriven trading system in 1985 and 1986 on futures and 
options in violation of federal regulations governing the soundness 
of sampl investments 
the complaint also named as defendants shearson salesman douglas 
j shaw and former shearson salesmen earl pettet and arthur donald 
robb jr the complaint which was filed before the commodity 
futures trading commission seeks at least 97 million in damages 
including the return of 11 million in commissions 
fslic also filed a 74 million suit in us district court in 
denver against francis bud hildenbrand who allegedly took over 
a portion of keys trading account in november 1985 after the 
institution terminated its relationship with pettet 
a third complaint filed against prudential bache and robb 
alleges that prudentialbache shared keys trading account with 
shearson lehman after robb left shearson to join prudentialbache 
that complaint filed with the cftc seeks at least 28 million in 
damages 
peter costiglio a spokesman for prudentialbache in new york 
said the brokerage firm would vigorously fight the charges 
the firm contends that it did not act improperly and the 
trading done in the account was done with the full knowledge and 
instructions of the savings and loan he said 
fslic also filed suit in federal court in oklahoma city seeking 
at least 15 million in damages against two other brokerage firms 
geldermann inc of chicago and umic inc of memphis along with 
umic sales representative charles alex denny 
the oklahoma city suit alleges that futures and options trading 
done by the brokerage firms resulted in more than 6 million in 
losses at universal savings 
the civil suit also named as defendants three former executives 
connected with universal savings arthur a wallace the president 
of universal gregg crosby vice president of universal futures

radicals and republicans celebrities 
and neighbors turned out to honor abbie hoffman as a wisecracking 
gadfly who stayed true to his antiestablishment convictions 
he didnt change his ideals when the ideological fashion 
changed said his cousin newspaper columnist sydney schanberg 
he stood up against arbitrary power capricious power and 
arrogant and callous power 
in other words he stood up against bullies i think thats 
why we cared about abbie so much because he had the courage for 
the rest of us said schanberg whose experiences as a 
correspondent in cambodia were the basis for the oscarwinning 
movie the killing fields 
at least 900 people packed temple emanuel on wednesday in memory 
of the 1960s activist outside an overflow crowd of more than 100 
stood listening to the service over a loudspeaker hoffmans body 
was cremated 
the turnout included easy rider producer bert schneider 
former basketball star bill walton and folk singer pete seeger who 
led hundreds of mourners from hoffmans childhood home to the 
synagogue a few blocks away singing abbies spirit is still 
alive to the gospel song down by the riverside 
hoffman 52 was found dead at his home near new hope pa on 
april 12 a coroner ruled tuesday that he committed suicide with an 
overdose of barbiturates mixed with alcohol 
friends and relatives said hoffman had been suffering pain from 
a recent car accident but they doubted he took his own life 
as a friend it is my belief abbie died of an overdose of 
caring and love said schneider who with actor jack nicholson 
helped hide hoffman while he was a fugitive from justice in the 
1970s to avoid trial on cocaine possession charges 
hoffman gained fame as part of the chicago seven a group of 
radicals who were tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 
bloody 1968 democratic national convention in chicago hoffman and 
four others were acquitted of conspiracy but convicted of crossing 
state lines with intent to riot their convictions were overturned 
jerry rubin one of the chicago seven said i think abbie 
felt the pain of the world and exploded 
mourners ranged from graysuited businessmen to longhaired 
colleagues from hoffmans days as founder of the yippie movement 
or youth international party a loosely knit group of radicals to 
protest the government and the vietnam war 
among them were aron kay who made a name for himself by 
throwing pies in faces of public officials 
abbie was a man who had guts and chutzpah he was a true 
patriot said kay who wore a tiedyed tshirt and hat knit of 
rainbowcolored wool with a yippie pin stuck in it 
abbie was my hero said jay severan a republican political 
consultant from new york city he was the first and best media 
consultant i ever knew 
schanberg read excerpts from hoffmans closing arguments in his 
1987 trial in northampton on trespassing charges stemming from his 
arrest at an anticia demonstration with amy carter daughter of 
former president carter hoffman and the other defendants were 
acquitted of the charges 
i grew up with the idea that democracy is not something you 
believe in or a place you hang your hat but its something you 
do hoffman told the jury you participate if you stop doing 
it democracy crumbles and falls apart

the united states can expect only limited 
cooperation from foreign countries in the war against drugs 
because most drugsupplying countries have weak or hostile 
governments according to senate testimony 
where the countries have strong central governments and are 
allies of the united states such as france and turkey the 
cooperation is much easier to obtain said sen daniel p moynihan 
dny who submitted a written statement to the senate caucus on 
international narcotics control 
moynihan recalled his trip to those countries in 1968 when their 
heroin exports were a major problem and he was an assistant to 
president nixon 
both turkey and france had strong central governments capable 
if they chose of doing what we asked them to do he said in a 
statement wednesday further each was a military ally of the 
united states which is to say we were all members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
he said turkey was able to stop farmers from selling opium to 
traffickers and france curbed the conversion into heroin but he 
added that success there had was counteracted by failure with 
governments that have a weak grip on their countries 
peru burma and afghanistan face violent civil war he said 
laos afghanistan and iran are openly hostile to the united 
states brazil has uncounted square miles where government 
authority is limited 
moynihan argued that money is better spent on treating addicts 
at home 
a 10 percent success rate in treatment is meaningful in a way 
that a 10 percent success rate in eradication of crops is not 
he said 
moynihans reference to turkey was supported by robert s 
dillon a former us ambassador there dillon attributed success 
in turkey to us financing of a factory to process the raw opium 
for medical use and the ability of the turkish government to 
control the trade 
diego asencio former us ambassador to colombia emphasized 
that us spending to fight drugs abroad is low compared with sums 
expended at home he pointed to the 70 million that william j 
bennett in charge of federal drug programs wants to use in 
washington alone 
spending 14 or 15 million in mexico is a joke he said 
its not indicative of a serious program 
he described us policy in latin america as designed to 
embarrass other governments into using their own resources against 
drugs that was not effective because it encourages lip service by 
those governments rather than action he added

the bush administration says the congressional 
irancontra committees never saw two recentlyreleased politically 
sensitive documents but denies there were any efforts to conceal 
them according to a published report 
an unnamed administration official told the washington post the 
documents were in an archive whose contents were available to the 
committees if they specifically requested them but the panels 
never asked to see the documents the official said 
one document refers to thenvice president george bushs secret 
involvement in a deal to reward honduras for aiding the nicaraguan 
contras the newspaper reported in todays editions 
the paper said the officials account left open the possibility 
the committees would not have known the contents of the documents 
in question and would not have known to request them 
key members of the irancontra panels have raised the 
possibility that several important white house documents on former 
president reagan and bushs role in efforts to reward those aiding 
the contras were withheld from the house and senate panels 
bush has said twice that the documents which were released 
during the trial of former white house aide oliver north were 
available to the irancontra committees 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday night the 
documents in norths national security council office were 
immediately seized by the fbi and sealed up on the late november 
1986 weekend during the initial inquiry into the irancontra affair 
by then attorney general edwin meese 
he added that the documents had been in the joint custody of the 
white house and the fbi and said the white house had at least 
partial custody because many of the documents were classified 
he said the white house had some say in the way the 
documents were dispersed but he insisted that at no time were they 
offlimits to the committees

three eviltasting tablespoons of herring oil each 
day can lower mildly elevated blood pressure providing some of the 
best evidence yet that fish oil is good for the heart scientists 
reported today 
although the seeming benefits of fish oil have been widely 
touted little hard evidence has been offered to back up these 
claims now two researchers skeptical about fish oils powers say 
they have surprised even themselves by finding that it seems to 
work 
their study conducted on 32 men found that big daily doses can 
return mild high blood pressure to normal levels it appeared to 
work about as well as diuretics or the beta blocker propranolol 
two medicines widely prescribed for high blood pressure 
it opens the possibility that this type of therapy may 
ultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood pressure 
said dr garret a fitzgerald who with dr howard r knapp 
conducted the study at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn 
its an important first step in that direction fitzgerald 
said given an adequate dosage fish oil appears to lower blood 
pressure in people with elevated high blood pressure 
the amount of fish oil used in this experiment was much higher 
than that recommended by manufacturers of the fish oil gel capsules 
sold in grocery stores and pharmacies in fact when taken at the 
dose usually suggested the oil did not help 
other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heart 
disease by repairing damaged arteries lowering dangerously high 
cholesterol levels and making the blood more slow to clot 
despite their encouraging findings the vanderbilt researchers 
said people should not exchange their blood pressure pills for fish 
oil until doctors know more about its effectiveness and safety 
at bostons beth israel hospital dr richard pasternak noted 
that several large studies are under way adding 
this research is consistent with other experimental evidence 
and this is an important break in that regard 
according to the latest report published in todays new england 
journal of medicine a month of fish oil lowered the mens average 
blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to 132 over 
90 
to achieve this they had to take three tablespoons of herring 
oil daily the liquid oil which caused belching and a lingering 
fishy aftertaste is not widely available because it spoils quickly 
the amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules 
like those sold in supermarkets and drugstores knapp said taking 
that many is impractical because big doses of them often cause 
upset stomachs 
the doctors also cautioned that people should not substitute cod 
liver oil which contains too much vitamin a and d and not enough 
omega3 fatty acids oily ocean fish such as herring and mackerel 
are rich in omega3 fatty acids the particular variety of fish oil 
that appears to be good for the heart 
herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega3 the 
doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are becoming 
available these may allow people to get fish oils benefits while 
taking less 
fish oil is not the drug of choice for treating hypertension 
but the study shows that that dietary change can markedly reduce 
our risk of high blood pressure said dr mark milner of 
washington hospital center

leftist guerrillas have 
launched an assassination and bombing campaign to try to provoke 
human rights abuses by the armed forces and new government the 
presidentelect and us ambassador say 
the rebels say the armed forces and authorities of the rightist 
governmentelect are increasing repression in preparation for a 
total war against suspected leftists 
alfredo cristiani who was elected president last month and 
takes office june 1 and us ambassador william walker made their 
comments during separate meetings wednesday with foreign 
correspondents 
their analyses came shortly after the assassination of attorney 
general roberto garcia alvarado when a bomb placed on the roof of 
his jeep cherokee exploded while the vehicle was stopped at a 
traffic light 
any increase in rights abuses by the armed forces and the new 
government both men said would be used by guerrilla supporters in 
the united states to lobby for a cutoff in vital us aid to el 
salvador 
they the guerrillas are not going to achieve that said 
cristiani leader of the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
or arena 
arena and the us embassy have blamed the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front for three assassinations since 
midfebruary and for the bombing friday of the house of francisco 
merino the vice presidentelect 
one person was slightly injured in the attack on merinos house 
the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for the recent 
slayings of miguel castellanos a former rebel 
commanderturnedgovernment informer and francisco peccorini a 
rightist academic 
the insurgents denied responsibility for the bombing of merinos 
house there has been no claim of responsibility for garcias 
killing 
the guerrillas are quite obviously attempting to provoke a 
nasty violent reaction from the government the elected government 
or the armed forces to their acts of barbarism said walker 
the provocation is coming from one side they the rebels are 
trying to drag this place back to the early 1980s he said 
walker was referring to a period when rightist death squads were 
killing hundreds of suspected leftists each month local and 
international human rights groups as well as former us 
diplomats link stillactive arena leaders such as roberto 
daubuisson to the death squads 
the party denies the allegations 
the terrorists are trying to provoke an uncontrolled vengeful 
reaction said cristiani they would then exploit that abroad 
to politically isolate the new government and cut off aid 
several leftofcenter labor and rights organizations disagree 
with both mens contention that the provocation is coming from one 
side only 
andes the biggest teachers union has blamed militarylinked 
death squads for the abduction and assassination of two teachers 
since late february 
maria cristina gomez a union and feminist activist was 
abducted by heavily armed civilians as she left school april 5 and 
shoved into a darkwindowed jeep cherokee witnesses said her 
bulletriddled body the skin of her back and arms peeled away by 
acid was discovered an hour later 
darkwindowed jeeps are a sort of trademark vehicle for death 
squads 
walker said he and other embassy officials have met with arena 
leaders to encourage them to pursue a rational reasoned 
response to guerrilla violence 
in a related development government forces killed an argentine 
doctor and a french nurse who worked with leftist guerrillas the 
armed forces and the rebels said wednesday 
an armed forces communique identified the foreigners as gustavo 
islas caceres of argentina and madelaine languedoc of france 
clandestine rebel radio said islas caceres languedoc and three 
salvadoran rebels were killed saturday after being captured during 
an army attack on a rebel field hospital in the eastern province of 
san vicente 
the armed forces said the foreigners were guerrilla fighters who 
were killed in combat along with seven salvadoran rebels 
walker said the embassy had concluded the foreigners were killed 
in combat about 30 miles east of the capital

congress had its eye on voters more than the 
constitution when it banned the 2 billion dialaporn business 
last election year an attorney for one of the larger telephone 
message services told the supreme court 
but a justice department lawyer arguing in favor of banning all 
dialup services offering sexually explicit telephone messages says 
the law is needed to protect children from hearing patently 
offensive speech 
the court which heard arguments wednesday in a california case 
must determine whether the lawmakers can issue an outright ban that 
fails to distinguish between indecent and obscene material 
the justices will also be looking at whether technological 
safeguards exist to prevent children from dialing the services 976 
numbers the 976 exchanges also are used for other 
noncontroversial types of messages such as sport scores time 
checks and weather reports 
born in 1983 the dialaporn industry matured quickly in 1984 
justice department richard taranto said 180 million such calls 
were placed by customers in new york alone the industrys income 
last year topped 2 billion he said 
harvard law professor laurence tribe representing a dialaporn 
service known as sable communications said the availability of 
technical safeguards makes this flat ban illegitimate 
when justice byron r white asked tribe why congress passed the 
total ban tribe responded thats not a hard question it was an 
election year 
i didnt say it was hard white said as laughter filled the 
courtroom 
the total ban on dialaporn never was imposed because a federal 
judge in california ruled that the 1988 law could be applied only 
to obscene not merely indecent phone messages 
us district judge wallace tashima in los angeles said 
outlawing nonobscene messages even though they may be 
inappropriate for minors violates the freespeech protections of 
the constitutions first amendment the government appealed the 
ruling to the supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor said wednesday she doubted whether 
the proposed ban meets the least restrictive means test the 
court has used when scrutinizing governmental interference based on 
speech content 
she asked the governments lawyer why technological safeguards 
such as scrambling devices or access codes could not provide a 
feasible and effective way to preserve the states compelling 
interest in protecting children while allowing adult access to 
such services 
taranto answered that the various safeguards contain 
significant loopholes 
when justice antonin scalia suggested the case involved material 
on the borderline of what is constitutionally protected tribe 
disagreed 
tribe said many of the telephone messages at issue are merely 
suggestive and not at all sexually explicit 
other dialaporn messages tribe said cannot be distinguished 
from a lot of whats in rrated movies and racy novels 
but scalia responded i dont think thats where the money 
is 
past supreme court decisions have excluded obscene material 
but not all sexually explicit or indecent material from 
constitutional freespeech protections 
the court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that 
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive 
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct and one that taken as 
a whole has no serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
congress in 1983 attempted to protect children by imposing 
restrictions on dialaporn services but did not seek a total ban 
until 1988 the ban was challenged by sable which offers 
dialaporn services in many states 
the 1983 measure allowed government regulators to impose 
restrictions aimed at limiting childrens access to dialaporn 
messages those restrictions included requiring dialaporn 
services to accept only credit card calls and to operate at times 
when parents most likely would be available to supervise their 
childrens actions

two death row inmates constructed 
dummies squeezed through a small air vent and were sawing their 
way out of prison when they were caught but they say the two hours 
of freedom were worth it 
you cant blame a guy for trying says james paster 
he made the comment in an interview wednesday a week after he 
and cellmate noble mays wiggled out their cell and into a utility 
corridor where they tried to saw through a ceiling exhaust fan 
said paster i felt like i was doing something for myself 
instead of waiting for relief from the very people who had sent me 
here 
mays added you just try to work as fast as you can and as 
quiet as you can i wasnt out to hurt anybody 
paster 44 a former lounge singer and elvis presley 
impersonator is awaiting death for a 1980 contract killing in 
houston mays 35 was sentenced to die for a 1979 robbery and 
stabbing death in wichita falls 
guards noticed the pair was missing in the early hours of april 
11 when a nurse who was supposed to give mays some medication could 
not awaken him from outside the pairs cell 
when guards opened the cell door they discovered the men in the 
bunks really were dummies made of clothing stuffed with newspapers 
and tobacco cans 
they also discovered the tiny vent to a corridor behind the 
cells was really cardboard 
mays and paster were discovered hiding above some pipes about 
15 to 20 feet from their cell with paster acting as lookout mays 
was trying to saw through bars that blocked a large exhaust fan to 
the roof on their wing of the ellis unit of the texas department of 
corrections outside huntsville 
the next stop would have put you about 100 yards from the 
fence mays said 
now the two are confined in separate cells known as 
administrative segregation the maximum security on the texas death 
row they also have been barred from participating in the deathrow 
work program 
prison officials say no inmates have ever escaped from death row 
at the ellis unit 
but that didnt deter mays 
what are they going to do to me he said we werent out 
to hurt anybody neither of us had weapons or anything 
im sure everybody would love to pull something like that 
off he said 
both men laughed about how they must have looked as they 
struggled to fit through the tiny vent that led outside their cell 
i still dont know how i got out mays said 
i still got pieces of my hide hanging there paster added 
paster said mays went through the hole first and then got 
stuck 
i greased him up while he was caught up in there paster 
said after i quit laughing so hard i finally decided to grease 
him up 
he said he used several bottles of hair tonic as a lubricant 
both men said a guard patrolling the area came so close to 
finding them that they could have touched him but mays had 
unscrewed a light bulb making it difficult to see 
paster said they came up with idea to flee about a month ago 
while playing chess 
noble said it was my move he said i said i had a better 
idea

players continued to make position adjustments in the wake of the 
tuesday release of the march us consumer price index the figure 
a 05percent increase slightly up from februarys 04 percent 
indicated a slowdown in the us economy 
toshio kiri of the bank of tokyo attributed the dollarshigher 
opening in tokyo to similar trends on overseas markets in the wake 
of higher oil prices 
but the us currency gradually eased due to dollarselling by 
export companies he said 
the majority of japanese investors however made only minor 
technical adjustments kiri said 
even though investors start selling the dollar it is unlikely 
to fall further because the currencys still quite strong he 
said

2261 a barrel the highest level since jan 17 1986

hikes he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
but i believe the japanese economy has become strong enough to 
remain stable against such external factors the analyst added

the government is mounting a prescription drug 
benefit program for medicare beneficiaries that officials say will 
help guard against adverse reactions that hospitalize at least 
200000 elderly people a year 
richard kusserow inspector general for the department of health 
and human services told a house panel on wednesday the medicare 
computer system would link the nations pharmacies so a pharmacist 
would be able to tell on the spot whether the patient is taking 
another drug that could react with the new one 
he said time is needed to establish the system saying it would 
be stupid for congress to be so insistent on enforcing an 
arbitrary deadline for setting up a computerbased billing system 
that it closes off the possibility of building in the safeguards 
kusserow was called before the subcommittee of the select 
committee on aging to elaborate on a study that has found the 
medicare program paid at least 500 million in 1987 for hospital 
admissions that were related to an adverse prescription drug 
reaction or an overdose

targeting south korea for sanctions under 
americas tough new trade law could produce a severe backlash there 
and even destabilize the countrys fledgling democracy warns the 
south korean trade minister 
minister han seungsoo summarized to reporters wednesday the 
message he brought to us government and congressional leaders 
this week south korea has been a responsive and responsible us 
trade partner and branding it as an unfair trader could have highly 
adverse results at home 
our democracy is only about one year old and much more fragile 
than the philippines he said comparing south korea to another 
us ally it would be advisable not to destabilize our 
democratization program 
under a 1988 law the us government has until the end of next 
month to designate countries with persistent surpluses with america 
for investigation of unfair trade practices and potential 
sanctions south korea is a candidate for such targeting

memoirs that the picture of her and wright was taken in wrights 
office on capitol hill before he became house speaker 
in its copyrighted story the paper said that at the time ms 
bordes was working for the indian mystic and businessman chandra 
swami the meeting was arranged by the swami who had business 
connections in washington the paper reported 
it continued among the things discussed according to those 
close to the swami was the possibility of obtaining a green card 
permit for pamella officially to become an american resident 
unknown to jim wright this was at a time when she was in her 
own words working as sex bait for the swamis international 
business deals at the meeting the swami presented mr wright with 
some ceremonial gifts and pleaded with him to help pamella 
his wrights staff sent a copy of this picture to pamella 
signed with his best wishes she and the swami left the country in 
a hurry after a business deal began to go legally sour 
a spokesman for mr wright said last night wednesday that 
they remembered the meeting with the swami and his party of which 
pamella singh as she was then known was a member but they did 
not recall doing anything to help her obtain a green card 
wright was cited monday by the house ethics committee for 69 
violations of house rules including allegations he improperly 
accepted nearly 145000 in gifts and that his wife was paid 
72000 for work she didnt do 
he has denied charges he violated any house rules including the 
alleged use of book sales to duck a speechfee limit

prince and with libyan ahmed gadaff al diam 
the daily mail identified al diam as a cousin of libyan leader 
col moammar gadhafi secondincommand of libyan intelligence and 
libyas top arms buyer in europe 
she was quoted in wednesdays installment as saying she got 
money from al diam and stayed in touch with him until shortly 
before she got a job last year as a researcher in the british 
parliament 
it was that job that led to the british presss discovery of her 
background and raised questions about whether national security was 
compromised by allowing free movement in the house of commons to a 
woman with highlevel libyan connections 
ms bordes fled to bali was tracked down by british reporters 
and offered her story to the highest bidder 
khashoggi 54 was arrested tuesday in switzerland on a us 
warrant charging that he helped hide assets that deposed 
philippines president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda 
allegedly stole from their country 
the tabloid said her sexual availability was a hard currency 
used to smooth contacts between ruthless arms dealers and nations

the government says the discovery of a 
third bomb this one hidden in a television set by police probing 
the case of two jailed palestinians indicates they may be linked to 
the downing of flight 103 
according to the governments today in parliament news service 
police found the bomb in the same apartment in the duesseldorf 
suburb of neuss where two other explosive devices hidden in radio 
tuners were seized last week 
one boobytrapped tuner exploded monday at federal police 
headquarters in wiesbaden when experts tried to disarm it killing 
hansjuergen sonntag 35 and wounding a 29yearold colleague 
in a followup search of the apartment investigators found the 
third bomb alexander prechtel spokesman for the federal 
prosecutors office in karlsruhe said wednesday 
british investigators looking into the dec 21 pan am crash have 
said the plane was blown out of the sky over scotland by plastic 
explosives hidden in a radiocassette player 
the imprisoned palestinians hafez kassem dalkamoni and abdul 
fattah ghandanfar are suspected of forming terrorist cells in 
west germany illegal possession of weapons and two bomb attacks on 
us military trains prechtel said the train attacks in august 
1987 and april 1988 caused no injuries 
prechtel confirmed details of the parliamentary report but said 
again that no solid evidence has emerged to link the palestinian 
case with the disaster over lockerbie that killed 259 people on the 
plane and 11 on the ground 
the news service informs federal officials of matters discussed 
in parliamentary committees wednesdays report was based on 
information brought to the bodys internal affairs committee no 
sources were cited 
there is a possible connection between the bomb found 
thursday and the crash of the jet over the scottish city of 
lockerbie on dec 21 it said 
prechtel disputed the suggestion that the probe of the two 
palestinians suspected of being agents of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command turned up indications 
the two were involved with lockerbie 
i know about that being said but that is nothing but 
speculation he said they cant say its not connected so 
they speculate that it is but we have no evidence that it is 
connected to lockerbie only the theoretical possibility exists 
the two palestinians were arrested in october after what police 
said was the biggest seizure of illegal weapons in west germanys 
history 
authorities refused to describe the three bombs found last week 
in detail or say whether they were armed with plastic explosives 
similar to those found in the october raids 
a radiocassette player bomb containing the same type of 
czechoslovakmade plastic explosives as used in the pan am bombing 
was among the weapons seized in october 
police arrested 14 suspects in the october raids but only 
dalkamoni and ghandanfar remain in custody 
prechtel said tuesday that authorities expect to file charges 
against the two within a few months and bring them to trial this 
year

border traffic and trade were picking 
up after a sharp drop that followed the discovery of 15 mutiliated 
bodies believed to be the work of a drugsmuggling cult 
but traffic on the two rio grande bridges connecting matamoros 
to its texas neighbor brownsville was still less than normal on 
wednesday officials said 
fear and rumors generated by the discovery of the bodies at two 
nearby ranches and the arrest of five cult members still pervaded 
this city of nearly 500000 
reports that cult leaders had threatened to abduct and sacrifice 
children if fellow members were not freed prompted parents to pick 
up their children from school on wednesday police said the calls 
were a hoax 
they news media are creating the psychosis with all these 
rumors said a telephone operator at the federal police office 
we have hundreds of people calling to ask if the rumors are 
true 
jesus urquiza martinez the regional police commander said 
special guards were being posted especially at outlying schools 
cult leaders alfonso de jesus constanzo a cubanamerican and 
sara aldrete of brownsville still were at large and federal 
investigators said the search for the missing cult members 
continued and was being coordinated by the mexico city office on 
wednesday 
an attorney generals office spokesman in mexico city said there 
was no new information in the case on wednesday 
he denied an earlier report by mexican officials in matamoros 
that aldretes purse her passport and 15000 had been found at a 
mexico city apartment and that she was feared dead 
juan benitez ayala commander of the federal judicial police in 
matamoros said earlier this week that some officials feared 
constanzo may have ordered aldretes death 
the discovery last week of the first of the 15 bodies many of 
them mutilated sent waves of horror through this border community 
we cannot hide reality chamber of commerce director andres 
cahuigh said this happened here but it could have happened 
anywhere we must now start showing again the good things about 
matamoros and we must remind our visitors that this is a good city 
quiet with a healthy society 
officials said traffic across the border dropped 80 percent in 
march after the disappearance of mark kilroy a 21yearold 
university of texas student abducted and killed by the cult

an army sergeant who was sentenced to 
death for the murders of a woman and two of her children was 
acquitted in a retrial and will return to his military post 
timothy hennis was to report today to fort bragg and then 
transfer to fort knox ky where he is still assigned to the 
personnel control facility he retained his rank throughout the 
trial and appeal 
hennis 31 was acquitted wednesday and jumped when the verdict 
was read he then broke into tears 
i missed my wife and i missed my daughter especially my 
daughter he said calling the last four years a nightmare 
in may 1985 hennis was charged with murder in the deaths of 
kathryn eastburn 32 her daughters kara 5 and erin 3 he also 
was charged with raping mrs eastburn 
i personally didnt feel at any time that he was proven 
guilty said new hanover county superior court juror kenneth 
wells for a lot of us it was a pretty quick decision to make 
the jury deliberated a little more than two hours some jurors 
remained in the courthouse to hug hennis his family and attorneys 
one juror said a key to the acquittal was the prosecutions 
failure to prove that hennis was inside the eastburn house on the 
night of the slayings 
the second trial included testimony from a new witness who said 
he often took walks at night in clothing similar to what a witness 
in the original trial said he saw hennis wearing that night 
juror debbie mcdowell said the jury believed the original 
witness was mistaken when he identified the man in the eastburns 
driveway late one night as hennis 
hennis told police when he was arrested that he had been at the 
eastburns house earlier in the day in response to an advertisement 
they had placed in the newspaper seeking a home for their dog but 
he denied he was there later that night when the killings were 
believed to have taken place 
he was convicted in 1986 but the state supreme court ordered a 
new trial because of graphic photos of the crime scene that were 
shown to jurors 
air force capt gary eastburn the victims husband called the 
retrial a mistake and said there was no basis for the supreme 
courts decision 
i was shocked at first surprised disappointed eastburn 
said 
he said he planned to return to england where he and a 
surviving daughter now live

the tokyo stock exchanges main index fell and the 
dollar edged up against the japanese yen today as a rise in oil 
prices encouraged dollar buying and discouraged stock purchases 
traders said 
the 225issue nikkei stock average shed 17868 points or 054 
percent closing at 3318515 the index had gained 4217 points to 
a record 3336383 close wednesday 
the dollar ended trading at 13228 yen up 040 yen from the 
previous days 13188yen finish it opened at 13240 yen and 
ranged between 13210 yen and 13247 yen 
traders said the dollars higher opening in tokyo followed a 
rise on overseas markets after a sharp rise in oil prices 
triggered by a north sea gas explosion 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may price of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude rose 110 to 
2261 a barrel the highest since jan 17 1986 
after opening higher however the dollar gradually fell as 
export companies and small trading houses sold dollars from their 
overseas revenues said an analyst with a commercial bank in tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
then a rumor about a possible japanese interest rate hike 
spread in the market and inspired yen buying he said adding 
that he could not confirm the rumor 
the analyst added that dollar buying also dropped off because of 
a comment by bank of japan governor satoshi sumita that the 
dollars further climb would be harmful for japanese prices 
at a meeting with credit bank officials today sumita said 
the dollars excessive rise can be a big roadblock for our 
efforts to keep japanese prices stable and ensure a smooth 
adjustment process in major nations 
he predicted the dollar is unlikely to climb persistently 
now because economic fundamentals affecting it remain more or less 
unchanged 
on the stock market dealers said the oil price increase largely 
discouraged investors 
the price of tokyo electric power co stock directly affected 
by the higher oil price dropped 40 yen and closed at 5790 yen 
its lowest this year 
a nomura securities dealer speaking on condition of anonymity 
said investors biggest concern is a possible interest rate hike in 
japan 
higher oil prices could lead to a lower yen and inflation and 
then interest rate hikes aimed at curbing the inflation 
concerns over an interest rate hike are much greater than 
concerns over political instability the dealer said 
the release of the japanese consumer price index figure next 
week already has been making players reluctant to make major moves 
because the cpi is an important indicator of economic growth he 
added 
volume on the first section of trading was estimated at 900 
million shares down from wednesdays 14 billion

doctors can ethically use tissue from aborted 
fetuses for research and medical treatment a committee at stanford 
university concludes 
the guidelines drawn up by an ethics committee at stanfords 
medical center are similar to rules proposed by a federal 
committee last december 
some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of 
diseases by transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses 
the stanford guidelines published in todays new england 
journal of medicine include 
women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from 
the medical use of their fetuses they should not be reimbursed for 
their abortions 
medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit 
from the use of the fetal tissue 
fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to 
cadavers 
fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using 
their tissue 
while noting that abortions remain intensely controversial 
the report concluded that human fetal tissue can be used for 
medical purposes subject to certain important considerations 
last may robert windom assistant us secretary of health and 
human service announced a moratorium on using fetuses from 
elective abortions in federally funded research in december a 
national institutes of health advisory committee concluded that 
using fetal tissue for research is acceptable health and human 
service secretary louis sullivan has not yet made a decision on the 
panels report 
in an editorial in todays new england journal lawyer george j 
annas of boston university school of medicine and dr sherman elias 
of the university of tennessee said the reports of the stanford and 
nih committees are consistent with each other 
together these documents show wide agreement in the medical 
community on the major issues involved in the use of fetal 
tissue they wrote

six members of a family killed in a 
winery workers jealous rage were buried and the service was 
followed shortly by word of the alleged killers arrest in mexico 
some 50 mourners attended the private service wednesday at 
calvary catholic cemetery as dozens of sonoma county sheriffs 
deputies roamed the perimeter with binoculars and radios 
the tight security stemmed from fear that ramon salcido 28 
might still be in the area but salcido was arrested in mexico 
later wednesday and confessed in a television interview to killing 
his wife two daughters his motherinlaw two of her daughters 
and one of his coworkers last week 
salcido 28 told police he thought his wife had been having an 
affair with the coworker 
at the funeral robert richards and his sons gerald robert jr 
and louis carried six coffins they contained the bodies of 
richards wife marian louise 47 his three daughters marie 8 
ruth 12 and angela 24 who was salcidos wife and granddaughters 
sofia 4 and teresa 1 
i dont know how anyone could survive this mentally without a 
belief in god said judith kelly a friend of the salcido family 
for 13 years who said she attended church with them theres a 
reason for everything and i know the whole family and all the rest 
of us feel that way 
you have to accept this but this is not going to answer the 
question why she said we dont know why 
the rev kenneth cabral a retired roman catholic priest and 
longtime friend of the richards recited the rosary and officiated 
white caskets carrying the four dead children and gray caskets 
containing the adults were taken one by one from a mausoleum at the 
cemetery to the burial site then lowered into the ground along 
with metal crucifixes and flowers 
kelly said the three richards sons attending agreed they want 
the surviving salcido child carmina 3 to live with a family 
member when she recovers from injuries suffered when her father 
allegedly cut her throat and abandoned her at a dump with her dead 
sisters whose throats were also cut

the battleship uss massachusetts has 
been out of commission since 1946 but the giant gun turret on deck 
is still a testament to the power and danger involved in operating 
its three guns 
the turret with 18inchthick walls is similar to that of the 
uss iowa where a fiery explosion wednesday killed at least 47 crew 
members 
the massachusetts turret contains six levels on the uppermost 
is what is called the turret booth which resembles a cramped 
boiler room and is where the turret officer directs the firing of 
the 16inch guns 
according to mark newton a former marine who is curator of the 
uss massachusetts the operations leading to the firing of the guns 
were compartmentalized after a number of accidents in the 
ammunitionhandling process 
beyond the turret booth are three individual gun rooms and three 
powder hoist rooms where the gunpowder is kept prior to firing 
said newton who was a guest aboard the iowa for a week in 1987 
after the shell is placed in the gun a door is opened to the 
gun room from the powder hoist room the powder is then rammed in 
behind the shell and what is called a breech plug is sealed to 
prevent the leakage of powder gases 
the oneton shells can travel up to 23 miles in 70 seconds 
newton said there are typically four men in each gun room and 
one in each powder hoist room though the numbers can vary there 
can be as many as a dozen men in the turret booth newton said 
additional crew members would be on other levels of the turret 
the uss massachusetts a south dakota class ship commissioned 
two years before the iowa is about 200 feet shorter than the 
887foot iowa one of the largest battleships ever built it is 
docked permanently in fall river a city 50 miles south of boston 
and is on display to the public

confessed to killing seven people in california including his wife 
and two of his daughters in what mexican police said was a frenzy 
of jealousy over her 
authorities prepared for extradition proceedings they said could

mexican citizen 
im guilty the 28yearold salcido said in a television 
interview with the private televisa network wednesday night in 
mazatlan i did the killings in the united states and i expect to 
be judged there

said in the interview he refused to discuss his motives for the 
crimes but said i came to mexico to see my parents for the last 
time

in the mexican capital salcido was to undergo more questioning 
as well as extradition proceedings officials said he had crossed 
the us border at calexico 
the attorney generals office said salcido told police under 
questioning he had lived in california for nine years and acquired 
american citizenship 
but us authorities say salcido apparently never applied for 
us naturalization papers and remains a mexican citizen meaning 
the extradition process could take months arias said the process 
could be completed in as little as a day or so 
salcido could face the death penalty under california law 
mexico has no capital punishment 
he was arrested the same day services were held in petaluma 
calif for the six members of salcidos family who were killed 
salcidos wife motherinlaw two sistersinlaw and toovey 
were butchered and shot to death friday the next day three of 
salcidos daughters were found with their throats cut two of them 
dead 
the only survivor 2yearold carmina is recovering in petaluma 
valley hospital she told investigators her father cut her and her 
sisters 
salcidos friends told the san francisco examiner that he had a 
frenzied cocainefueled night of drinking and dancing before the 
killings 
the friends said the binge began the night of april 12 a day 
after salcido had been served with fresno county calif court 
papers ordering him to pay 511 a month support for a 4yearold 
daughter from another marriage plus nearly 6000 to the county 
for back payments 
in san francisco affidavits filed against salcido in us 
district court this week disclosed he left a note asking gods 
mercy and blaming the law for the slayings apparently referring to 
the court order in the childsupport case 
under a 1973 treaty mexico is obliged to honor any us 
extradition request but the procedure is cumbersome and can take 
months 
a us court has to request the extradition detailing the 
evidence through the department of justice and the state 
department which in turn petitions the mexican department of 
foreign affairs 
the department has to approve it then turn it over to the 
mexican attorney generals office which also has to approve it 
the petition then goes to the federal judge holding the suspect 
who next issues a warrant ordering the suspect to be surrendered to 
us authorities

a judicial panel declared the independent 
farmers union rural solidarity legal today three days after 
relegalizing the solidarity independent trade union movement 
the reinstated private farmers movement can now organize 
nationwide and negotiate with government or state enterprises in 
this nominally socialist country where 75 percent of the arable 
land is privately owned 
in a perfunctory hearing in a warsaw provincial court judge 
danuta widawska head of a threejudge panel said rural 
solidaritys registration application met the conditions of a law 
passed by parliament two weeks ago that granted farmers the right 
to unionize 
jozef slisz leader of the union that he expects to grow to 
about 500000 members was among the handful of union officials 
present at the sparsely attended hearing 
i am pleased after all eight years of illegal work resulted 
in this happy day we never doubted that this work would lead to 
the moment fulfilled here now when our union would be 
registered 
rural solidarity is separate from but allied with the workers 
solidarity movement led by lech walesa like solidarity it existed 
legally for more than a year but was banned after the dec 13 
1981 martiallaw crackdown 
the solidarityled opposition argued during two months of talks 
with authorities that the farmers union should be permitted 
the series of accords reached april 5 included a specific 
provision that rural solidarity would be legalized 
slisz said his union has been promised by government officials 
an office in warsaw and hopes to receive it by next week 
the rural solidarity leader said that in all probability he will 
be a solidarityendorsed candidate for senator from his home 
province in rural southeast poland 
the senate which is to be another result of the roundtable 
talks is to be the first freely elected legislative body in the 
soviet bloc the elections are scheduled for june 
the farmers union plans to fight for lower taxes for farmers 
higher minimum state prices for their produce and improvements in 
the countryside where many villages still lack basic elements of 
modern life like running water paved roads and telephones 
authorities agreed at the talks to introduce a total free market 
in buying farm produce but it is to be phased in over time so as 
not to be too shocking to consumers who already complain of high 
food prices 
many private farmers have been cutting back deliveries to state 
procurers charging their prices are too low to be profitable and 
have been selling directly to consumers themselves at higher prices 
or simply cutting back production private farms produce 80 percent 
of polands food

president bush is facing increasing 
congressional criticism over his handling of the alaska oil spill 
and a public opinion poll shows a sharp drop in the presidents 
rating on environmental issues 
a hearing before the senate environmental protection 
subcommittee wednesday was marked by repeated questioning of 
administration witnesses on why the federal government did not move 
more quickly to control the spill and limit its spread along 
alaskas southern coast 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine suggested bush 
was far too slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster 
and said federal laws should be changed to require that the federal 
government assume control of such a spill immediately unless it is 
clear the cleanup is going properly in private hands 
because of the unbelievably slow response by not only 
industry but also the bush administration there has never been a 
time when this situation was under control said sen max baucus 
dmont chairman of the environmental subcommittee 
several republican senators though not critical of bush 
personally said they had little confidence in leaving the cleanup 
to exxon corp and that the administration should have moved more 
quickly to deal with the spreading oil in alaskas prince william 
sound 
im disappointed the president didnt see it that way said 
sen ted stevens ralaska adding that the oil spill on march 24 
is likely to have an impact on the wildlife ecology and economy of 
southern alaska for years to come 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who has been the 
presidents point man in the spill recovery acknowledged 
disappointment in exxons performance and said of the industrys 
contingency plan for such an accident on the scale of one to 10 
it was a zero 
but he defended the administrations decision to leave the 
cleanup chore largely with the oil company exxon had made a 
total financial commitment and they had the technical 
expertise to deal with the problem that was already out of the 
bottle skinner told the senators 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
said members of the federal emergency response team were mapping 
recovery strategy within hours after the spill but along with 
exxon had decided early on that the greatest priority in the days 
immediately after the accident was not containing oil already in 
the water but keeping additional oil from escaping the tanker 
which at times appeared in danger of sinking 
meanwhile a coalition of environmental groups today released a 
poll indicating that the spill has affected how bush is perceived 
in dealing with environmental issues 
the telephone survey conducted by lou harris amp associates shows 
a 21 percent drop in the number of people who believe bush is doing 
a good job in handling environmental matters according to debra 
callahan executive director of americans for the environment 
according to the survey 60 percent of the respondents gave bush 
a positive rating in handling the environment and 32 percent a 
negative rating when surveyed in february in the march survey 
shortly after the alaska spill bushs positive rating dropped to 
39 percent and the negative rating jumped to 49 percent according 
to the polling company 
the poll was based on telephone interviews with 1250 people 
nationwide between march 26 and march 30 ms callahan said 
samples of this size normally have margins of error of about three 
percentage points either way 
the results of the survey were made public by the americans for 
the environment the national wildlife federation and the sierra 
club as part of a study of public attitudes as reflected by 
opinion polls on environmental issues over the last two decades 
on april 7 bush directed greater federal involvement in the 
cleanup effort committing military assistance to the recovery and 
putting adm paul yost the us coast guard commandant in charge 
of coordination in alaska 
bush himself suggested in a speech last week to the american 
society of newspaper editors that he might have responded too 
slowly in directing increased federal involvement in the cleanup 
saying he perhaps should accept some criticism on that count 
if theres a lesson here that one agency or another might have 
moved faster i will be the first to learn from that said the 
president

a man who admitted giving more than 200 
documents to the south african government has been sentenced to 10 
years in a federal prison and fined 5000 
communicating vital classified information to agents of a 
foreign power is despicable us district court judge herbert f

i can only hope that with time i can demonstrate to my children 
that their father is an honorable man 
the 215 pieces of information the civilian analyst relayed from 
1979 to 1983 were only moderately damaging or of little threat to 
national security assistant us attorney gary jordan said dolce

apparently because of a personality clash with a new defense 
attache 
jordan said dolce provided south africans with classified 
information about us and soviet conventional weapons systems 
their capabilities and their frailties 
harold i glaser dolces attorney said the civilian analyst 
did not intend to harm the united states but saw himself as helping 
the united states by aiding an ally dolce said he did not get any 
money for the information which he passed on at the south african 
embassy in washington and at missions in london and los angeles 
dolce was intent on assisting south africa its war in angola 
against sovietbacked cuban and marxist angolan troops glaser said 
dolce resigned sept 30 from his 34000ayear job as a 
research analyst for the army material systems analyst activity an

the uss iowa a world war ii hulk of a 
battleship with wooden decks and the rare added amenity of a 
bathtub has been struck only once by enemy fire despite two wars 
and patrol duty last year off the persian gulf 
with nine 16guns that can hurl shells as heavy as a small car a 
distance of 23 miles the iowa is at once threatening and majestic 
only it and the three other ships in its class have cannon that 
large 
consigned to mothballs for 24 years after the korean war the 
iowa and three sister battleships were refitted for modern warfare 
during reagans military buildup in the early 1980s 
in addition to cannon the iowa the wisconsin the missouri and 
the new jersey bear 32 tomahawk cruise missiles capable of carrying 
nuclear warheads 1000 miles four 20mm guns able to shoot 100 
rounds in less than a second at antiship missiles and 16 harpoon 
missiles that can hit ships up to 60 miles away 
supporters of the recommissioning said the cost of refitting 
each battleship about 400 million was the same as building a new 
frigate a ship with far less firepower the iowa cost 114 million 
to build 
when it was launched in 1942 thensecretary of the navy frank 
knox called the iowa the greatest ship ever launched by the 
american nation 
protected by 17inch thick armor the dark gray ship has a top 
speed of 30 knots iowa class battleships were the largest built by 
the united states surpassed in size only by two japanese 
battleships the yamato and musashi most of its 887foot length is 
decked in wellscrubbed wood 
during world war ii the heyday of ships of its size the iowa 
fought in both the atlantic and pacific oceans 
the battleship carried president franklin d roosevelt to 
morocco on the first leg of his journey to tehran in 1943 to meet 
with winston churchill and josef stalin to discuss the war against 
germany 
a bathtub installed on the iowa for that voyage remains aboard 
to this day making it the only ship in the navy with such a regal 
convenience 
the iowa was in the heat of the action during the pacific 
campaign fighting in decisive battles off the south sea islands of 
tinian okinawa and formosa 
the battleship was struck by enemy fire for the first and only 
time during that pacific campaign hit by two japanese shells while 
it was supporting air strikes against kwajalein and enewetak atolls 
in the marshall islands 
the damage was slight however and the iowa was anchored in 
tokyo harbor as us occupation forces went ashore at the end of 
world war ii in 1945 
the battleship was retired from service in 1949 then brought 
back for duty in the korean war during that conflict the iowa 
fired more than 4500 rounds from the 16inch guns exceeding the 
amount fired from ships in that class during world war ii 
the iowa returned to mothballs in 1958 and spent the next 24 
years in the philadelphia navy yard by the time the iowa was 
recommissioned in 1982 it had been in active service for only 12 
of its 40 years 
modernization made it possible to operate with a smaller crew 
60 officers and 1500 enlisted men compared with the 117 officers 
and 1804 enlisted men aboard during world war ii

a jury has recommended that a former 
librarian be sent to the electric chair for killing six people and 
trying to kill 24 others in a 1987 shoppingcenter death spree 
a videotape showing a composed and articulate william cruse 61 
hours after the rampage was the prosecutors best weapon jurors 
said 
we all felt the same he knew what he was doing juror 
edward cook said wednesday after the polk county panel brought in 
the death penalty recommendation for the murders of two young 
college students a 67yearold grandmother an engineer and two 
police officers 
the same jury rejected an insanity plea and convicted cruse on 
april 5 of 32 counts of murder attempted murder and kidnapping in 
the april 23 1987 melee at two shopping centers in palm bay 
about 30 miles south of cape canaveral on floridas east coast 
cruse declared war on the community of palm bay said state 
attorney norm wolfinger the jury verdicts were very appropriate 
without that tape the jury would have had to guess they saw 
the real cruse on that tape 
it was the tape said jury foreman wayne hogan the tape 
had a lot to do with it 
circuit judge john antoon set sentencing for july 28 when he 
can sentence cruse either to death or to life in prison with the 
possibility of parole in 25 years 
the videotape shown during the fiveweek trial showed an 
apparently relaxed cruse answering questions about the shootings 
he expressed surprise that he had shot anyone but said he was 
trying to get back at people who taunted him and thought he was 
a homosexual he said he was drunk and crazy

the foreign ministers of iran and iraq resumed 
unsponsored peace talks today after a fivemonth hiatus but 
statements by both sides suggested prospects for an agreement were 
slight 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in response to a reporters 
question dismissed demands iran has made for a full withdrawal of 
iraqi troops from iranian territory as a precondition for progress 
at the talks 
the iranian side should know it has no right to dictate to 
set the priorities at the talks aziz said after he and his 
iranian counterpart ali akbar velayati held separate meetings 
with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who is 
mediating the talks 
the talks have to address the whole peace plan with all its 
provisions and all its obligations aziz said 
he was being asked about velayatis call on perez de cuellar to 
set a date for the iraqi pullout and devise ways to monitor it 
direct talks between the two delegations were scheduled for 
later today at the geneva un building 
the negotiations are aimed at consolidating the unsupervised 
ceasefire that has been in effect in the persian gulf since august 
velayati made a statement wednesday night accusing baghdad of 
illegitimate and expansionist aims and renewed charges that 
iraqs refusal to withdraw was holding up implementation of a un 
peace plan 
aziz reiterated charges that iran was bargaining in bad faith 
and said real negotiations had never begun 
the united nations last week called for more flexibility on both 
sides 
after arriving in geneva the un chief told reporters that 
positions remain rather far apart but he said a continuing 
dialogue was important and that agreement on holding talks signaled 
each sides interest in finding a negotiated solution on fully 
carrying out un ceasefire resolution 598 
un officials have said the talks are expected to run at least 
two days 
the ministers last held direct negotiations in november 
peace talks began aug 25 five days after a ceasefire took 
effect after eight years of fighting in the gulf war they soon 
stalemated over iranian demands that iraqi troops withdraw to 
prewar borders and iraqs call for dredging of its only outlet to 
the persian gulf the shattalarab the waterway is clogged by 
sunken ships ordnance and accumulated silt 
iran has said the operation could begin once the border issue is 
resolved 
also unresolved is the issue of returning prisoners of war 
both sides have sent back only a few hundred pows since late 
last year despite the un resolutions call for immediate 
repatriation

sony corp today announced it has developed a 
portable digital videocassette recorder that allows tapes to be 
copied or edited more than 20 times with little loss in quality 
the machine dubbed the dvr1 is the first portable vcr that 
uses digital rather than analog recording resulting in better 
picture quality and little picture distortion when copies are made 
sony officials said 
in digital recording video and audio information is converted 
into a series of binary pulses such as those used by computers to 
process information compact discs also use digital recording to 
improve sound quality 
although the machine is intended primarily for professionals 
such as television journalists company officials said they plan 
eventually to develop one for the general public 
the recorder will go on sale in january for a list price of 
37000 sony said it weighs 24 pounds is batterypowered and can 
record up to 94 minutes on a single cassette tape 
we definitely plan to produce a consumer model and bring the 
price down eventually to about 760 said a sony official who 
requested anonymity 
sony has been selling a nonportable digital videotape recorder 
for studio use since july for about 87000 
when conventional analog videotapes are copied and recopied 
such as during editing at tv stations picture quality begins to 
decline after several copies or generations sony said tapes 
recorded on the dvr1 can go through more than 20 generations with 
little quality loss 
if sonys digital videotape format becomes widely accepted it 
could also reduce present problems of convertibility between the 
worlds many television systems because of the greater ease in 
processing digitally recorded information

the armed forces fairly treat allegations 
of homosexuality against female members says the chairman of a 
civilian advisory group despite testimony that claims of 
lesbianism are being used to harass women 
being charged with anything is not harassment connie lee 
head of the defense advisory committee on women in the services 
said wednesday after a day of testimony from present and former 
servicewomen some who said they were homosexual 
if someone is charged with this they have the opportunity as 
any person does in any court of law when they are accused of 
something of saying i am or i am not lee said at the spring 
meeting of the committee 
lee would not predict what if anything the committee would 
recommend to the defense secretary as a result of the hearing 
although she said the committee opposes harassment in any form the 
committee composed of 33 appointed civilians advises the 
secretary on the recruitment and retention of servicewomen 
four witnesses two of whom were discharged from the service for 
admitting their lesbianism and two of whom are fighting allegations 
of homosexuality asked the committee wednesday to tackle the use 
of such allegations for sexual harassment 
it is time to call attention to institutionalized sexual 
harassment in the form of witchhunts that are out of control 
said mary elizabeth harrison a first class personnelman in the 
navy an underlying dangerously tolerant attitude exists 
throughout the military structure which places women at a 
significant disadvantage in the armed forces in all aspects from 
advancement to morale to retention 
harrison had been assigned to the uss grapple a salvage ship 
based in little creek va when a male crewman last year accused 
her and another woman sailor of being homosexual harrison said she 
wanted to file a grievance but i was told that the commanding 
officer did not want an investigation on his ship because of how it 
might appear so she declined to file 
months later harrison said she was summoned before the naval 
investigative service and told she and several other woman sailors 
were under investigation for alleged homosexuality 
we were told various lies that we would be protected if we 
turned the others in that the others had already confessed that 
they had conclusive evidence of our guilt she said 
in the five months since harrison said she has been reassigned 
to shore duty received bad evaluations had her car vandalized in 
the barracks parking lot and become the gossip of the 
waterfront 
i am beginning to understand how women simply become exhausted 
fighting a nowin battle and admit anything in order to leave the 
abuse and humiliation of the military behind she added 
darlene chamberlin a former airman first class in the us air 
force who was discharged for admitting her homosexuality to an 
investigations panel said some servicewomen are accused of 
lesbianism because they refuse advances from male personnel or are 
strong and athletic or for choosing to socialize with other 
females 
according to the defense department from 1985 to 1987 women 
were three times as likely as men to be discharged for 
homosexuality five of every 10000 men and 16 of every 10000 
women on active duty were discharged annually for suspected 
homosexuality dod found 
some witnesses touched on the situation at the marine boot camp 
in parris island sc where three women were jailed and more than 
a dozen were forced out of the service last year after being 
charged with homosexuality

a nurses aide who had told police she 
killed at least 39 elderly hospital patients now says she killed 
22 a police investigator said today 
max edelbacher told the associated press that waltraud wagner a 
30yearold nurses aide at viennas lainz hospital last week 
withdrew her earlier confession of 39 killings 
state prosecutors refused then to give details but edelbacher 
said ms wagner now had identified by name 11 people she killed 
she said she killed 11 more whose names she could not provide he 
said 
police showed ms wagner photographs of possible victims today 
to try to jog her memory edelbacher said 
ms wagner was arrested april 7 along with two other nurses 
aides irene leidolf 27 and maria gruber 26 a fourth aide 
stefanie mayer 49 was detained two days later 
police said then that the four women had admitted to killing at 
least 49 patients at lainz since 1982 they said they doubted the 
motive was mercy killing because the victims had water forced into 
their lungs or died from lethal doses of medicine 
in questioning today ms leidolf stuck to her confession of 
killing three patients edelbacher said 
edelbacher said ms gruber and ms mayer would be interrogated 
friday along with dr franz pesendorfer the suspended head of the 
hospital department where the nurses aides worked 
none of the women has been charged but all are in custody 
the killings have prompted a nationwide debate about the 
standard of health care particularly in viennas overtaxed 
hospitals 
alois stacher the doctor in charge of the capitals health 
department today announced eight emergency measures to try to 
relieve the overworked doctors nurses and other personnel at 
viennas hospitals 
they included an undefined reorganization of hospital 
management measures to move convalescing patients out of needed 
hospital beds and new teamwork among doctors nurses and aides in 
hospital wards 
stacher also mandated a new oneyear trial period for 
doctors of pesendorfers rank who head departments and new 
regulations laying down exact working hours for them 
several such senior doctors maintain private practices outside 
the hospitals where they work 
pesendorfer has been severely criticized in austrian media for 
failing to tell police investigating rumors of mass killings at his 
department a year ago the name of the doctor who had heard the 
speculation 
there also has been widespread criticism of the violation of 
regulations barring aides from administering injections to patients 
under austrian law doctors are only allowed to hand that task 
to qualified nurses if absolutely necessary

vermonts largest daily newspaper have voted overwhelmingly to 
unionize results tallied today show 
the vote was 7747 to join the graphic communications

publisher donna donovan said burlington free press employees 
have chosen to be represented by a union and we fully respect their 
choice 
we are elated said copy editor paul beique a union 
supporter now we can begin preparing to negotiate a contract 
workers at the free press had complained of low wages unpaid 
overtime and recent reductions in health benefits they alleged 
gannett has taken profits from the free press and other newspapers 
to support other enterprises notably usa today its nationally 
circulated newspaper 
donovan countered that salaries have improved during her three 
years at the paper that she has added new staff to the newsroom 
recently and that workers would lose more than they would gain by 
joining a union 
about 140 employees were eligible to vote in the election 
fourteen votes were challenged either by the company the union or 
the national labor relations board and are not contained in the 
124vote total

president mikhail s gorbachev called for closer 
ties between american and soviet trade unions at a meeting with two 
us labor leaders pravda reported today 
gorbachev expressed support for american trade unionists who 
are for a dialogue for the development of relations between the 
soviet and american trade unions the communist party daily said 
it is strange and incomprehensible when a dialogue has already 
been established on the governmental level but on the union level 
great obstacles are still encountered gorbachev was quoted as 
saying by the soviet news agency tass he met wednesday with 
aflcio vicepresidents william winpisinger and jack sheinkman 
as recently as october 1988 there were no official ties between 
soviet labor unions and the aflcio based on the aflcios 
contention that soviet labor organizations exist not to represent 
the interests of their membership but as governmentcontrolled 
organizations to keep workers in line 
the soviets say that is not true and gorbachev himself in 1987 
called on soviet unions to be more vigorous in defending the rank 
and file 
gorbachev also told the labor officials that a national plan has 
been worked out to convert some defense factories over to civilian 
production and several enterprises have been designated as 
prototypes pravda said 
the conversion is planned to follow defense spending cuts and 
help fulfill gorbachevs promises to improve consumer goods 
production 
a leningrad shipyard that has produced naval hardware for 150 
years has already begun partially retooling to produce food 
processing equipment as well tass reported today the yard which 
was not identified in the report expects to have produced nearly 
35 million in nonmilitary goods by 1991 tass said 
the partial conversion follows orders to leningrads 
shipbuilding industry to produce machines for cafes pizzerias and 
snack bars as well as equipment for sausage and dumpling making 
tass said

sothebys auction house says it hopes its 
decision to stop selling elephant tusks or ivory jewelry furniture 
or artworks less than 50 years old will help stop the slaughter of 
elephants 
the auction house announced the decision wednesday saying the 
new policy would apply to sothebys 17 auction centers and 44 
offices worldwide 
this is very much of a corporate statement that we support the 
groups that are trying to stop this slaughter and this atrocity 
said michael ainslie sothebys president and chief executive 
officer 
the move followed a large advertisement placed in the new york 
times by friends of animals of norwalk conn decrying the 
scheduled auction friday of two african elephant tusks for an 
estimated 12000 to 16000 
the ad which ran wednesday said nearly 1 million elephants or 
threefourths of africas wild elephant population have been wiped 
out since 1979 
the tusks in question were legally acquired before 1976 said 
ainslie 
nonetheless we are very much aware that laws 
notwithstanding the visibility of such a sale does have the 
potential to induce more destruction said ainslie the seller 
has decided on our strong recommendation to remove them from the 
sale 
later wednesday sothebys bought the tusks from the 
unidentified seller for an undisclosed sum they will be donated 
to an appropriate institution or museum said a spokeswoman 
diana levitt 
were thrilled said priscilla feral president of friends 
of animals now were going to ask them to firm up the decision 
by refusing to deal in any ivory regardless of the age 
ainslie said sothebys consulted with the african wildlife 
foundation before making its decision which will affect a very 
small portion of its profits 
ms feral said her group also would ask the competing christies 
auction house to follow sothebys example 
christies spokeswoman roberta meneker said generally 
speaking we do not intend to sell ivory but we cant make a 
categorical statement 
she said a distinction should be drawn between modern ivory 
pieces and an 18thcentury tusk that comes from england or 
france

a woman who drank bourbon regularly during 
pregnancy is seeking damages from a liquor company for her sons 
severe birth defects in a potentially landmark federal case 
candace thorp of seattle and her husband harold are suing the 
james b beam distillery co of kentucky claiming it should have 
provided warning labels on its whiskey bottles pointing out that 
alcohol can cause birth defects 
the thorp case is believed to be the first lawsuit involving 
fetal alcohol syndrome to go to trial in the nation the seattle 
postintelligencer reported today seattle doctors first identified 
and named the syndrome in 1973 and one of those doctors is listed 
as a witness for the thorps 
the case is scheduled to go to trial in us district court in 
seattle with jury selection starting monday 
fiveyearold michael thorp was born mentally retarded 
neurologically impaired developmentally stunted with facial and 
other body malformations according to court documents 
mrs thorp said in court documents that she drank up to a half a 
fifth per day of jim beam bourbon during her pregnancy she said 
she didnt know her drinking would damage her child 
attorneys for the beam company argue in their briefs that any 
damage that may have resulted was due to mrs thorps decision to 
drink while pregnant 
the thorps and attorneys for both sides declined to be 
interviewed 
in the lawsuit filed in november 1987 the thorps claim the 
manufacturer was negligent in not warning consumers the liquor 
company says washington state law governing product liability does 
not require manufacturers to issue warnings of risks that are 
considered generally known by the community 
in a deposition beams chief executive officer barry m 
berish said that he was aware in the late 1970s of fetal alcohol 
syndrome and studies linking alcohol use in pregnancy to birth 
defects berish said he opposed putting warning labels on bottles 
because it would be ineffective 
the pregnant woman that is the abuser that has the addiction 
that is the excessive drinker you could put a skull and crossbones 
on the bottle and she will continue to consume alcohol berish 
said 
congress last year approved in antidrug legislation a provision 
requiring that all beer wine or liquor containers be labeled with 
a warning that alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects 
the law goes into effect in november 
an estimated 30000 children are born in the united states each 
year with fetal alcohol syndrome according to a 1982 university of 
washington study

mourners rioted today during the funeral of 
a boy slain during an earlier demonstration against price 
increases and soldiers killed at least one person sources said 
unrest was reported in villages near kerak and south of the dead 
sea the latest violence in a wave of rioting that has left at 
least seven people dead 
a local reporter said he saw soldiers fatally shoot at least one 
person and wound two people in mazar eight miles south of kerak 
when demostrations occurred during a funeral today for a youth 
slain on wednesday 
family members identified the person killed today as yacoub 
katawneh a cousin of the slain youth 13yearold ibrahim katawneh 
the reporter said a local official in mazar on wednesday shot 
the youth and an air force major as a demonstration passed the 
officials house but authorities in amman suggested the shooting 
might have been a personal matter unrelated to the current unrest 
the two deaths near kerak 50 miles south of amman were in 
addition to five deaths reported wednesday in maan 120 miles 
south of amman 
maan where the disturbances first broke out tuesday remained 
under curfew and was blockaded by the army residents said 
other riots were reported in villages north of kerak and at ghor 
essafi south of the dead sea there were no confirmed reports of 
casualties 
the government deployed troops on roads around population 
centers throughout southern jordan 
information minister hani khasawneh told the associated press 
today the riots were not a serious security threat and said 
the government had acted in full realization of the patriotism of 
our people 
he said security agencies have been inquiring into these 
incidents especially the looting and setting fire to government 
buildings and the false phone contacts with foreign press 
agencies 
the disturbances that broke out tuesday in maan apparently were 
triggered by governmentimposed increases in the prices of 
gasoline cigarettes and other items the increases were announced 
sunday as part of an agreement with the international monetary fund 
the price increases came on the heels of an economic slide that 
has sent per capita income tumbling to about 1200 a year from 
nearly 2000 in the mid1980s 
in washington king hussein told reporters wednesday i 
believe everything is under control 
the official jordan news agency reported today that crown prince 
hassan the kings brother responded to the incidents by calling 
for a conference to study the countrys development needs 
yousef azem who represented maan in jordans nowsuspended 
parliament said leaders of the maan region met in amman on 
wednesday he said they decided to seek calm in the region and to 
prepare a list of demands to give the government 
hussein said the disturbances resulted from measures that had 
to be taken as a result of the defaulting of several arab states in 
helping us a reference to the failure of arab oil states to 
meet a 1 billion yearly commitment to the kingdom agreed upon in 
1978 we had to take some measures and obviously people feel them 
the price increases announced sunday raised gasoline prices by 
25 percent to 165 a gallon and raised the cost of cigarettes 
telephone calls heating oil and cooking gas by 10 percent to 50 
percent 
prices of other commodities also have risen sharply the past 
year because of a devaluation of the jordanian dinar on world 
markets 
but local incomes have remained stable often at about 175 to 
275 monthly an economic slowdown has caused unemployment to rise 
to as high as 20 percent by some estimates 
rioters in maan kerak and other cities have stoned police 
burned official cars and attacked banks government offices and 
shops with stones and fire

reported wounded in clashes in the gaza strip 
sheikh mohammed al jamal a leading preacher at al aqsa called 
on moslems throughout the occupied territories to attend noon 
prayers at the mosque friday to challenge the ban 
the order was enacted after palestinians stoned police in the 
mosque compound following prayers on april 7 the first friday of 
the moslem holy month of ramadan 
the mosque compound known as haram al sharif or noble enclosure 
in arabic is the thirdholiest site of islam after mecca and 
medina in saudi arabia

mosque they are to pray in the old city of jerusalem if they are 
barred from entering the city they are to pray on the roads 
leading to jerusalem he said 
hassan tahboub a former administrator of al aqsa said the

a 19yearold who lost his life when 
he gave up a stadium seat to be near friends was remembered today 
in the first of 95 funerals for soccer fans who died in a weekend 
sports disaster 
more than 500 friends and relatives filed into christ church in 
the waterloo area of the city for the funeral of gary church a 
carpenter he was buried at a local cemetery 
inside his coffin was a small card made by his 6yearold niece 
claire it read uncle gary i loved you

stadium but gave it up to stand with friends in the cheaper 
standingroom section where 95 people were crushed or trampled 
saturday when latearriving fans crowded in 
fans and police have been trading accusations over who was 
responsible for the tragedy 
police have said drunkenness by liverpool fans played a part 
but officers have been criticized for opening a gate that allowed 
the late arrivals to pour into the match between liverpool and 
nottingham forest 
police say they had no choice but to open the gate to relieve a 
dangerous crush outside 
at churchs service the rev ray hutchinson alluded to the 
controversy 
he told the congregation which included liverpool soccer 
players that the message of caring and wanting to share your 
burden of grief has been sadly marred by insensitive distasteful 
and very badly timed remarks which have been reported coming from 
various quarters 
but here the message is loud and clear and all the stronger 
as our city again has to show its resilience to yet more pain and 
suffering he said 
a report wednesday in the daily express newspaper appeared to 
support the police it said three of the victims died in the crush 
outside and that three others were badly hurt outside 
police said they could not immediately comment on the report 
the daily express story quoted unidentified police eyewitnesses 
it was the first report of anyone dying outside the standingroom 
section

a former nurses aide was ordered to stand 
trial on charges of killing five nursing home patients after her 
onetime lover and coworker testified that she claimed the 
suffocations helped relieve stress 
gwendolyn graham 25 was bound over for trial on five counts of 
murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder after a 
district court hearing wednesday 
she was always happy when one of them died said her former 
lesbian lover catherine wood who was also charged in the 
killings wood testified that graham tried or plotted to kill at 
least five other patients but was foiled when some of the elderly 
men and women fought back 
the two counts of murder pending against wood will be dropped in 
exchange for her testimony according to a plea bargain announced 
earlier she has agreed to plead guilty to one count of 
seconddegree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder 
wood lived with graham in the first half of 1987 when wood 
testified that they attempted to kill enough patients to spell the 
word murder with the victims initials 
i asked her why and she told me it relieved her tension 
said wood who wept as she testified 
defense attorney james piazza contended there was no proof that 
any of the patients at alpine manor nursing home died of unnatural 
causes and said that wood was trying to take revenge on graham for 
leaving wood for another woman 
however district judge sherwin venema ruled there was 
sufficient evidence for graham to stand trial she could face life 
in prison without parole if convicted 
wood 27 said she was upset after witnessing the suffocation of 
the first victim 60yearold marguerite chambers in january 1987 
graham promised her the killing would stop she said 
but when another female patient died after struggling with 
graham wood said graham took that as a sign that it was supposed 
to go on graham took a souvenir from each victim including 
earrings anklets and handkerchiefs wood testified 
wood said she went along with the killings because i thought 
gwen was the first person to ever love me and i didnt want her to 
leave me 
police began investigating the deaths after woods exhusband 
reported alleged confessions by his former wife both women remain 
jailed without bond

the state department has sent cables to us 
embassies around the world and posted notifications acknowledging a 
district court finding of discrimination against female foreign 
service officers between 1976 and 1985 an attorney involved in the 
case said today 
the agency also has informed about 600 women working in the 
foreign service that they may be entitled to courtordered relief 
the actions stem from a suit filed in 1976 by alison palmer a 
nowretired foreign service officer who claimed the department 
discriminated against women in hiring and promotion said ms 
palmers attorney monica wagner 
however ms wagner said her client will not be a direct 
beneficiary of the court order because she has retired from the 
foreign service only those women who are part of the classaction 
suit and are still working for the foreign service are affected 
the benefit for her is in seeing the state department take 
action with respect to the sex discrimination found by the court 
ms wagner said 
the state department had won the palmer lawsuit in a lower court 
but was reversed three months ago by the us court of appeals for 
the district of columbia the state department has informed the 
court it is planning to appeal that decision 
ms palmer charged in her suit that the department discriminated 
against women by hiring more men giving men the better career 
assignments and more careeradvancing honors 
the agency also has announced that it has postponed the foreign 
service examination this year 
the test has been challenged because men pass the general 
background section at twice the rate of women

japan may develop its own surfacetoair missile in 
a 75 billion project a news report said today 
it would be the first antiaircraft missile japan developed 
using its own technology the leading economic newspaper nihon 
keizai shimbun said 
the report comes as tokyo and washington remain mired in 
disagreement over a proposal to jointly develop a new fighter jet 
an official in the finance ministrys budget bureau confirmed 
30 million were earmarked in the budget for fiscal year 1989 for 
study expenses for the missile but refused to elaborate 
japans budget for the current fiscal year which began april 1 
has not been approved by parliament because of an opposition 
boycott tied to a bribery scandal instead the government is 
operating on a 50day provisional budget 
the newspaper said the defense agency plans three years of 
research into areas such as radar and infrared sensors and guidance 
systems before beginning development of the new missile 
the missile would replace the patriot which japan produces 
under license from the united states under a 1985 agreement japan 
plans to deploy 26 japanesemade patriot systems over the next 10 
years to replace its aging nikej missiles 
one patriot system is estimated to cost 521 million and is made 
up of 20 patriot missiles a launcher and radar and firing control 
equipment it is capable of attacking multiple airborne targets 
within a range of 100 miles 
the newspaper said the plan to use japanese technology to 
develop the new missile system might bring a negative reaction from 
the united states which has provided japan with much of its main 
defense technology 
the united states may propose joint development of the new 
missile system as in the case of japans controversial 
nextgeneration jet fighter the fsx it said last year japan and 
the united states agreed that private companies from the two 
countries will jointly develop and produce a new jet fighter for 
japan in a project worth more than 8 billion 
the move was a compromise after washington wanted japan to buy 
usbuilt planes while tokyo wanted to develop its own aircraft 
but the two countries are currently reviewing the agreement 
because of opposition from some us congressmen who charge that 
the project would be a giveaway of us aviation technology

in the april 5 strike three lines operated fully and others 
offered partial services

of conductors who open and close doors 
the subway employs 2400 drivers

the environmental protection agency urged 
school officials today to test all school buidings for radon 
saying preliminary tests from 16 states show many schools have 
unhealthy levels of the cancercausing gas 
epa administrator william reilly said although the test results 
were only preliminary the levels found were high enough to warrant 
nationwide testing of school buildings 
it is important that school administrators nationwide 
understand both the seriousness of the risk and the relative 
simplicity of testing and fixing the problem said reilly in 
remarks prepared for the national press club 
based on measurements taken in 3000 schoolrooms in 16 states 
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in 
schools throughout the united states reilly said he called 
indoor radon one of the major environmental health threats facing 
americans 
radon is a colorless and odorless gas that is produced naturally 
by the decay of radium226 in soil and rocks while levels normally 
found outdoors 02 to 07 picocurie per liter pose no health 
concerns there are higher accumulations that are of concern when 
the gas is trapped indoors 
scientists estimate that as many as 15 percent of the lung 
cancer deaths annually may be related to indoor radon exposure over 
a lifetime the epa has said exposure levels of 4 picocuries per 
liter of air over a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a half pack 
of cigarettes a day 
the epa findings on radon levels in schools came from twoday 
tests conducted at 130 schools in 16 states the tests were 
conducted in 3000 rooms normally occupied by students teachers or 
other school employees said epa spokeswoman martha casey 
according to the figures from the schools tested 54 percent of 
the schools had at least one room in which radon levels were found 
to exceed the 4 picocuries per liter of air considered by the epa 
to be unhealthy and reflect a need for additional tests and likely 
corrective action 
the epa said of the 3000 rooms tested 19 percent had levels of 
4 picocuries or greater and 3 percent had levels of at least 20 
picocuries it was unclear how many of the schools had rooms with 
levels of 20 picocuries or greater 
the highest level was found in a schoolroom in tennesse where 
136 picocuries per liter were detected an exposure similar to that 
found in uranium mines where workers are urged to use respirators 
for breathing the epa said 
ms casey said no list of schools was available although she 
said state authorities and the school officials involved have been 
told of the test results 
the agency said actual exposure received by children is 
difficult to determine from the test data because in many schools 
students move from room to room on a given day and various rooms in 
a single school may have widely different levels of radon 
in addition to tennessee schools were tested in washington 
montana nevada wyoming colorado new mexico north dakota 
kansas minnesota missouri illinois indiana georgia new jersey 
and maine 
last september the epa urged all homeowners to conduct radon 
tests after unhealthy levels of radon were found in one out of four 
homes tested in 17 states 
there are no federal laws or regulations requiring radon tests 
or corrective action to be taken in either schools or private homes

researchers have cut short an 
experiment aimed at learning if the endangered florida panther can 
ever again survive outside the everglades 
the experiment in north florida was halted after the deaths of 
four of seven texas cougars used as surrogates for their florida 
cousins the remaining two in the wild were captured this week near 
osceola national forest according to tom logan chief of the 
wildlife research bureau at the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission the seventh was caught last week 
the two animals would not have given us any new information 
we dont feel its prudent or productive to leave the animals out 
in the field logan said wednesday 
the texas cougar a subspecies related to the florida panther 
was being studied to see how it adapted to north florida both big 
cats are closely related to the mountain lion or puma 
the florida panther once roamed north floridas woods but is now 
confined to the everglades of south florida where officials 
estimate no more than 50 survive the last confirmed north florida 
sighting of one was the early 1960s 
of the seven texas cats in the experiment one died of unknown 
causes two were shot by poachers and a fourth had to be killed 
after it was injured while being captured by wildlife officers 
in addition to the two caught this week one was removed from 
the wild last week after it took to hunting exotic deer at a 
private hunting preseve 
wildlife officials had planned to end the program in june a 
year after the release of the first five texas cougars 
when we had the original group they behaved as they should 
when the numbers were reduced things started happening logan 
said we need to evaluate the number of animals out there and how 
it affects them 
until information from the experiment is evaluated logan said 
he could not recommend whether florida panthers should be released 
in north florida

president bush said today my conscience is 
clear about the irancontra affair and promised to cooperate 
fully with congressional requests for white house documents dealing 
with the matter 
however bush said it was not clear that any documents are still 
within his control saying i think theyre in the control and 
custody of the archivist he said he had no reason to believe 
that the reagan administration withheld any documents 
meeting with a small group of reporters at the white house the 
president stuck by his earlier refusal to discuss his role in the 
irancontra affair but he added everything ive said ill 
stand behind 
documents introduced at the trial of former white house aide 
oliver north have raised new questions about bushs involvement 
while vice president in the reagan administrations secret aid to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
bush talked about the irancontra affair and other matters 
during an informal news conference with nine reporters he chose an 
informal setting for the gathering meeting with the press on the 
colonnade outside the oval office on a sunny spring day 
bush said he might have something to say about the 
irancontra affair after the completion of norths trial which was 
in its final stages today north is accused of lying to congress 
and obstructing a congressional investigation among other charges 
the president has declined in recent days to field questions on 
irancontra saying he didnt want to prejudice the north case 
however he said today lets put it this way my conscience is 
clear 
on other subjects bush 
expressed anguish about the shelling in lebanon saying he 
wished he had some dramatic plan the players could agree to its 
not there 
said his administration which is nearing the 100day mark is 
moving reasonably well and i dont even think in terms of 100 
days citing his broad budget agreement with congress and 
congressional action on his plan to rescue the savings and loan 
industry bush said were making some progress 
the president added i dont feel a need for some precipitous 
and dramatic initiative in order to salve the conscience of those 
who are saying youve got to do something in 100 days 
said he has not had any discussions nor made any decision about 
offering military aid to the noncommunist resistance in cambodia 
said he has not made a decision on how to modernize the nuclear 
arsenal bush said he will be prepared very soon to make a 
decision on funding for the star wars antimissile system and 
whether to continue deployment of the mx missile or fund 
development of a singlewarhead midgetman missile 
questions about the irancontra affair focused on the charges 
that some documents produced in norths trial were not turned over 
to the congressional committees that investigated the issue 
bush said he has seen no evidence that all pertinent documents 
were not made available 
however he said i would offer full cooperation for any any 
request made of this administration 
asked if would release any documents that congress wants to see 
the president said 
well procedures were set up to determine what documents were 
to be made available those procedures were agreed to by the 
congress and certainly i would see that if any documents are in 
control of this administration relevant documents that we would 
we would live assiduously by those guidelines 
but i have no reason to believe that the previous 
administration the lawyers in it who worked closely with congress 
did not fulfill their obligation 
asked then if he would cooperate fully in any senate 
investigation bush said he would defer then to the people who 
were in charge of the documentation which would be mr arthur 
culvahouse reagans white house counsel and company in whom i 
have great confidence but if theres anything we can do to 
encourage that absolutely 
on another subject bush said he was not prepared announce any 
restrictions now on semiautomatic weapons which have figured in a 
wave of violence much of it spawned by drug dealers 
i have expressed my concern about these weapons and their 
suitability so stay tuned i dont know exactly when it an 
announcement will be he said 
asked if thought interest rates should come down in view of the 
agreement with congress on the budget bush said i was very 
pleased with the market reaction to the budget agreement it seems 
to have been underreported but nevertheless its sort of 
heartening 
however he added im not heartened by the rising interest 
rates

svetlana alliluyeva daughter of dictator josef 
stalin scandalized her relatives during her stay in the soviet 
union and demanded her son be exiled to a remote pacific island an 
article published thursday said 
alliluyevas son josef was quoted in the newspaper soviet 
culture as saying his mother wrote his superiors demanding he be 
kicked out of the communist party stripped of his academic degree 
and the funniest of all shes demanding that after all that i 
be sent to sakhalin 
the newspapers article which contained revelations about a 
leaders family life still rare in the soviet press was part of a 
wave of public reexamination of all aspects of josef stalins long 
rule of terror 
alliluyeva defected from the soviet union in 1967 and returned 
in 1984 at age 58 saying she wanted to be reunited with her 
family a year and a half later she wrote a letter to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev asking permission to leave citing poor 
relations with relatives 
she has returned to her former home in wisconsin 
in an interview soon after her second departure she said that 
despite the special treatment she received in the soviet union she 
felt estranged from her son and his wife and other relatives whom 
she later joined in soviet georgia her fathers birthplace 
nv stalina alliluyevas niece said she created most 
disgusting scenes while on vacation with a cousin for her it 
meant nothing to humiliate another person she told maj a 
kolesnik who wrote the article based on newly opened archives and 
personal interviews 
in a letter to kolesnik alliliuyevas nephew y dzhugashvili 
furnished the quotes on sakhalin a former prison colony off 
eastern siberia from his conversations with iosif alliluyev and 
said svetlana seemed unwilling at first to meet with her son 
in the 1986 interview alliluyeva said that her son had changed 
unrecognizably in the 17 years since she had seen him and that she 
thought he had been instructed to invite her back to the soviet 
union perhaps by the kgb 
alliluyeva brought her 13yearold americanborn daughter olga 
peters with her when she came back to the soviet union in 1984 
in both moscow and the georgian capital of tbilisi she was 
given special privileges including the use of a car and a luxury 
apartment 
im sure she always felt a crown on her head despite her 
modest clothing and often gave orders and she repeatedly insulted 
her daughter dzhugashvili told soviet culture 
when she left tbililsi she announced that she was tired of 
living among savages dzhugashvili said 
alliluyevas move to moscow and back to the west were acclaimed 
as propaganda coups but she maintained that her reasons for the 
moves were purely personal 
when she returned to the united states she vowed she would 
never again return to the soviet union

the explosion in a 16inch gun turret aboard 
the battleship uss iowa may have been caused by redhot debris from 
a firing left in the breech a former commander of the ship said 
today 
capt larry seaquist the iowas commanding officer until last 
may refused to speculate on the exact cause of the accident that 
left 47 sailors dead 
but he told reporters at a pentagon briefing that an air system 
to clear debris from the breech must be operated manually raising 
the possibility that the procedure was overlooked before fresh 
gunpowder was loaded into the gun during a firing exercise 
it seems from the reports that those powders exploded 
seaquist said 
we simply do not know what caused that powder to go he 
said the early reports are that it was up in that gun room 
immediately behind the gun breeches 
other navy officers speaking on condition they not be 
identified by name said redhot debris seems to be the logical 
explanation for the explosion 
a pentagon spokesman fred hoffman confirmed that the explosion 
occurred during a firing exercise 
one of the 47 men killed in the explosion was the lone officer 
stationed in the turret phillip edward buch lieutenant junior 
grade from las cruces nm 
the officer would normally be stationed in a small compartment 
at the rear of the swivelling top of the turrent adjacent to the 
room in which shells are loaded 
defense secretary richard cheney en route home from a nato 
meeting in brussels said we have no eyewitnesses to what 
actually transpired 
ive been told in reports today that everyone who was in the 
turret at the time of the explosion was killed cheney said 
apparently referring to the swiveling gun house at the top of the 
turret rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition 
magazines below it 
under questioning by reporters seaquist said one possible cause 
of the explosion was debris left in the breech from a previous 
firing 
to clear the breech of such debris he said a sailor must 
manually activate a oneinch tube containing air pressurized at 
3000 pounds per square inch and then visually inspect the breech 
it ejects the gases out of the muzzle of the gun he said 
each of these men is welltrained and formally qualified to do 
this he said and they drill regularly 
the turret and the ship are constructed of thick steel and are 
designed in such a way that a fire or explosion in one compartment 
of the turret will not spread to other sections ignite powder 
magazines and spread the damage 
this gun the mark vii 16inch 50 gun remains the finest 
naval gun in the world it was the pinnacle of gun design art and 
it is still a frontline system seaquist said 
it was designed specifically to contain this kind of damage 
to limit the cascading effects he said referring to explosions 
that occurred aboard ships of earlier designs 
at some point during the accident wednesday the crew flooded 
the turret activating an overhead sprinkler system that sprays the 
compartments with pressurized salt water while still allowing 
sailors to scramble through exit hatches 
a complement of 74 sailors normally work inside each turret 
said seaquist 
hoffman said the reports coming in from the ship indicate that 
it was fully manned at the time of the firing there were 
survivors in the turret 
hoffman said he could not say whether all of those killed were 
inside the turret at the time of the explosion 
to launch a 1900pound projectile from the 62footlong 
barrels a team of sailors packs six gunpowder canisters weighing 
110 pounds each into the breech seaquist said 
the black gunpowder a total of 660 pounds is ignited 
propelling the shell from the barrel at a speed of 1500 miles an 
hour he said they actually dont explode they burn extremely 
rapidly in a matter of a fraction of a second 
hoffman declined to speculate on the exact cause of the 
explosion saying that adm richard d milligan a former commander 
of the uss new jersey a sister ship to the iowa was directing the 
navy board inquiry 
an investigation into the incident has already begun 
hoffman said he declined to predict when the inquiry would be 
finished reviewed by the navy and defense department and then 
released in summary to the public 
the ship experienced an explosion and a fire in its no 2 
turret about 10 am yesterday some 200 miles northeast of puerto 
rico said hoffman the ship was part of an exercise called 
fleetex389 
reports from the iowa say that 47 crewmen are dead between 10 
and 12 have suffered minor injuries most of these i understand 
are in the firefighting parties hoffman said there are no 
serious injuries and all those who have been hurt have been 
treated aboard ship 
each of the three turrets aboard the iowa has three 16inch 
guns is as tall as a sevenstory building and weighs 1800 tons 
as much as a world war ii destroyer seaquist said 
the 17inch armor is so thick he said that when a japanese 
shell hit the no 3 turret aboard the iowa in world war ii the 
crew inside didnt even know they had been hit now that is safety 
that comes from this massive armor and the compartmentation 
no one is known to have died in combat aboard the iowa during a 
career that spanned world war ii the korean war and patrol duty 
off the mouth of the persian gulf last year 
the black gunpowder used aboard the iowa was manufactured during 
the korean war and stored in crane ind in sealed bins seaquist 
said 
when the iowa was recommissioned in 1984 the navy emixed the 
gunpower tested it and repacked it into the 110pound charges that 
are stored in a magazines at the base of the turret the charges 
are passed through revolving doors designed to seal the magazine 
from the rest of the turret and the ship

supporters of salman rushdie the novelist under 
an iranian death sentence voiced dismay thursday at plans by 
british and other western publishers to exhibit at next months 
tehran book fair 
we are concerned that participation by publishers in this 
event will be interpreted by the iranian government and others as 
an acceptance of the death threat said a statement by the 
international committee for the defense of salman rusdhie and his 
publishers 
rushdie has been in hiding for two months since ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini said the bombayborn british writers novel 
the satanic verses blasphemed islam and sentenced him to death 
the committee said the may 719 book fair specializing in 
scientific technical and medical books is being run by the 
iranian ministry of islamic culture 
it said the iranians had withdrawn an invitation to viking 
penguin rushdies publishers but said other publishers from 
around the world including britain would participate 
the statement urged them to make clear to iran their 
condemnation of the death threat and to show support for 
international efforts to have it withdrawn 
the rushdie committee was set up to organize protests by 
freespeech groups and collected signatures from more than 1000 
writers worldwide on a petition that was published free of charge 
in newspapers in more than 20 countries march 2 
the oxford university press is one of the publishers exhibiting 
at the fair simon wratten sales director for the academic 
division said we deliberated about it quite deeply but felt 
that it certainly wasnt in our interests or irans as a whole 
to stay away 
nor he said would an exhibition of books on scientific 
subjects be seen in any way as supporting the ayatollahs 
decision he said 
in an interview wratten said the books already had been shipped 
to tehran but the company had decided against sending 
representatives fearing they might face danger and be put in in 
a very difficult position whereby they would have to make some 
sort of statement 
he said the decision was in line with other publishers 
adding that american publishers also were planning to exhibit 
after the death sentence was announced the bookseller a trade 
journal reported that publishers were going ahead with exhibits 
but would not send representatives fearing for their safety 
it quoted john hudson international sales manager for 
scientific publisher butterworth as saying as publishers our 
responsibilities are to individuals who want to read books not to 
governments to send books to book fairs does not imply approval 
for a regime otherwise there would be many bookfairs we did not 
participate in 
hudson was not available for comment thursday but his office 
said it was going ahead with its exhibit

with a somber 
salute from honor guards 47 flagdraped coffins bearing the 
victims of the worst navy disaster in more than a decade began 
their trip home today 
helicopters brought ashore the bodies of those killed in 
wednesdays explosion inside a gun turret aboard the uss iowa as 
the huge battleship anchored offshore then after a brief 
ceremony a plane bearing the bodies took off for a military 
mortuary in dower del and the ship left for its home port of 
norfolk va 
the pentagon today put the death toll at 47 and said other crew 
members were accounted for earlier spokesmen had said the death 
toll could be higher 
ten to 12 crew members most of them firefighters suffered 
minor injuries they were treated aboard ship and were back at work 
today the navy said 
a blue navy van carrying the coffins to the airstrip were met by 
special honor and color guards bearing the us navy and us 
marine corps flags the guards saluted each coffin as eight sailors 
acting as pallbearers placed them in the cavernous belly of a 
camouflaged c5 galaxy cargo plane 
the cargo doors closed at 1130 am edt and the plane began its 
long flight to dover 
some 100 reporters and photographers who had been allowed inside 
the base for a press conference and to watch the boarding ceremony 
were then told to leave and were not allowed back in 
the blast occurred during a gunnery exercise while the 
46yearold ship was on maneuvers about 330 miles northeast of 
puerto rico 
the explosion and fire were in the second of the two forward 
turrets at the loading position of the center gun in the threegun 
turret said bruce nason a navy spokesman at the pentagon 
eleven crewmen inside the turret escaped from a magazine area 
at the bottom of the sevenstoryhigh turret said vice adm jerome 
johnson commander of the us 2nd fleet who was aboard the iowa 
i can tell you the fire and explosion was instantaneous 
because it was instantaneous we have no other injuries johnson 
told reporters at a roosevelt roads news conference this morning 
the ships captain decided to remain 10 to 15 miles out to sea 
because the iowa draws 36 to 38 feet of water and the roosevelt 
roads harbor is only 40 feet deep said lt cmdr steve burnett a 
navy spokesman he said the ship would head for its home port in 
norfolk va after all bodies were brought ashore 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said an investigation of the 
incident has already begun and will be led by rear adm richard d 
milligan commander of cruiser destroyer group 2 and a former 
commanding officer of the battleship uss new jersey 
in norfolk about 200 relatives of the 1600 crewmen aboard the 
iowa spent the night at a norfolk naval station gym out of sight of 
reporters military policy requires that families of dead or 
injured personnel be notified before their names are released 
there are those who are really struggling and those who are 
really stoicsaid navy chaplain barry brimhall right now for 
some of these families they would rather have bad news than no 
news at all 
in temple texas lorene barron said all she could do was pray 
for her son monte barron and hope she would hear from the navy by 
telephone 
they told me if he was among the deceased they would 
personally visit us mrs barron said but i believe 
everythings going to be ok and im praying for all the mothers 
who are waiting just like i am 
lt russell a greer an atlantic fleet spokesman in norfolk 
said the explosion occurred while the ship was conducting open seas 
gunnery practice but did not know if it occurred as the gun was 
being fired 
each guns 16inchdiameter projectile is propelled by 
explosives in fabric bags loaded separately from the projectiles 
the gun requires up to five bags each containing 110 pounds of 
powder to fire a 2700pound round 
asked about the safety of the ship by reporters this morning 
president bush said he would want to ensure that procedures were 
checked to be sure that safety is at the highest point 
but i wouldnt jump to the conclusion that because that kind 
of powder was put into these turrets in that way that that makes a 
useful platform obsolete bush said 
naval officers familiar with the iowas gun turrets said an 
explosion can occur if a gun breech or back end of the barrel is 
cracked or from a shell that cooks off ignites prematurely 
from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel 
from the last round 
the first thing that comes to mind is something like a 
cookoff said capt paul hanley another spokesman for the 
atlantic fleet it could have been a powder bag or a 
projectile we just dont know yet 
capt larry seaquist the iowas commanding officer until last 
may told reporters at a pentagon briefing that a compressed air 
system to clear hot debris from the breech must be operated 
manually raising the possibility that the procedure was overlooked 
before fresh gunpowder was loaded into the gun 
each of these men is welltrained and formally qualified to do 
this he said and they drill regularly 
it was the worst loss of life in a naval accident since 1977 
when 49 sailors died when a 56foot launch returning sailors from 
shore leave in barcelona spain to the uss guam and the uss 
trenton was hit by a spanish freighter 
an iraqi missile attack on the uss stark in may 1987 killed 37 
crewmen and wounded 21 
a similiar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboard 
the heavy cruiser uss newport news during the vietnam war in 
october 1972 killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36 
it is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness 
president bush said in washington i will take this opportunity 
to express my regrets especially to the families of the kids that 
were killed 
a complement of 74 sailors normally man the massive turret 
which is seven stories tall and weighs 1800 tons as much as a 
world war ii destroyer said capt larry seaquist a former 
commander of the iowa who spoke to reporters at the pentagon this 
morning 
burnett said the explosion and fire were confined to the turret 
which is encased in 17inchthick steel armor on the sides and 
7inch armor on the top several forward powder magazines were 
flooded by crewmen to prevent a second explosion 
the uss iowa was one of 29 us ships participating in a 
threeweek training exercise to test fleet readiness which began 
april 13 
the iowa was commissioned in 1943 besides its 16inch guns the 
887foot iowa is equipped with 12 fiveinch guns and tomahawk and 
harpoon missiles the navy in accordance with policy declined to 
confirm or deny whether any nuclear weapons were aboard 
the 58000ton warship is one of the biggest in the world 
dwarfed only by the japanese world war ii battleships yamato and 
musashi each at 72000 tons

for the relatives of the uss iowas crew 
agony was not knowing their loved ones fates though some gained 
strength from each other at the ships home base a chaplain said 
about 200 relatives spent wednesday night in a norfolk naval 
station gym knowing that 47 of the 1600 crewmen died when a blast 
wednesday ripped through one of the norfolkbased battleships 
threegun turrets 
there is a lot of support within the group i saw 
relationships develop right before my eyes as women would put 
their arms around those who were having troubles navy chaplain 
barry brimhall said wednesday night 
rear adm jimmy pappas commander of the norfolk naval base 
said early this afternoon that a memorial service for the sailors 
killed on the uss iowa will be held at the base monday 
the victims included one officer and 46 enlisted men he said 
and 12 of the dead are from the hampton roads area in virginia 
its the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer pappas said 
the commander spent most of the night in the base gym waiting 
for identification of victims with family members 
its the most difficult thing you have to do to tell someone 
who has lost a relative he said those who found out a relative 
survived the tragedy were overjoyed with tears he said 
journalists were kept away from the gym at the families request 
most of the relatives left the gym by daybreak having heard 
about the fate of their own loved ones said master chief petty 
officer billy kinder a spokesman for the base the navy continued 
to notify other relatives across the country 
by navy policy relatives are notified in person when a loved 
one dies 
in temple texas lorene barron said all she could do was pray 
for her son monte barron and hope she would hear from the navy by 
telephone 
they told me if he was among the deceased they would 
personally visit us mrs barron said but i believe 
everythings going to be ok and im praying for all the mothers 
who are waiting just like i am 
in columbus ga the father of bruce morgan jr said that 
waiting to learn his sons fate is hell 
bruce morgan sr said his 19yearold son had told the family he 
was to be assigned to a gun crew on the iowa in march 
there are those who are really struggling and those who are 
really stoic brimhall said right now for some of these 
families they would rather have bad news than no news at all 
as the families waited in the gymnasium area residents swamped 
navy family services with offers of help the area is home to the 
worlds largest naval facility and many military retirees and its 
economy depends heavily on the military 
its been fantastic how everyone has pulled together both 
civilian and military said cathy stokoe deputy director of 
family services on the base 
the navy has a contingency plan for such disasters and it starts 
with taking care of the families said kinder 
the first thing we did was establish a place for them to 
gather we provide a place for them to be the chaplains social 
workers red cross and others are there to help them in anyway 
possible he said 
ms stokoe said merchants brought groceries to the families 
local stores are providing baby food and diapers at the gym 
and lots and lots of food she said the red cross has pulled 
out all the stops there are cots and blankets for those family 
members who are staying the night 
kinder said that the families are updated frequently on news 
from the ship 
officials said the surviving members of the crew had no serious 
injuries 
brimhall and his colleagues offer what he calls a ministry of 
presence for the families he said the primary purpose is to let 
the families know they have someone to talk to and to reassure them 
but brimhall said he still must be honest with them 
some are going to lose a loved one he said

efforts were under way to keep a giant oil 
slick apparently caused by a passing ship from reaching the 
shores of an island in southern greece the ministry of merchant 
marine said thursday 
pools of oil and tar about 200 yards wide were spread along 
seven to eight miles off kithira island said spokesman kostas 
stamatis 
the oil slick was discovered tuesday and officials hired three 
ships to contain and dissolve the oil with chemicals stamatis 
said in addition dozens of volunteers in small boats were helping 
out 
sea currents were bringing some of the oil to the eastern part 
of kithira he added 
the coast guard supported by the local authorities and 
volunteers was rushing to clean up the polluted area before it 
spread further he said 
we think that a passing ship might be responsible for the 
spill but the ministry is still investigating the cause said 
stamatis

a soviet oilskimmer joined the battle 
today to clean crudeblackened alaska waters just six months after 
a similar superpower cooperative effort helped free two whales 
trapped in ice 
soviet capt serge rekin piloted the ultramodern oilskimmer 
vaidogubsky toward the mouth of resurrection bay on the gulf of 
alaska to help in the cleanup of the gooey sludge left by the wreck 
of the exxon valdez last october the icebreaker vladimir arseniev 
smashed through ice near barrow helping to free california gray 
whales 
we really appreciated your being here captain exxon 
spokesman don cornett told rekin through an interpreter on 
wednesday this is the second time people from your country have 
come to the aid of the people of alaska and we thank you 
rekin said he had little information about the task he faced but 
that he wanted to begin work as quickly as possible the 425foot 
soviet skimmer is far bigger than any of the 20 or so skimmers that 
exxon has used so far 
as immigration and customs officials worked wednesday to approve 
the vessel children on the dock happily swapped candy with soviet 
crew members jackie phillips and a few of her friends stretched on 
tiptoes to hand cookies to the soviets its just a friendly 
gesture she said 
officials are hoping the vaidogubsky can vacuum up much of the 
101 million gallons of crude oil dumped into prince william sound 
on march 24 when the exxon valdez slammed aground on bligh reef 
outside valdez 
interior secretary manuel lujan arrived in anchorage on 
wednesday and left this morning for the spill site from an 
airplane he planned to review oilsodden beaches blackened rocks 
and dying birds and animals in what once was one of the nations 
most untarnished wild areas 
the vaidogubsky because it is designed to work on the high 
seas will be working initially on the gulf rather than the more 
sheltered waters of the sound 
ribbons of oil have traveled 300 miles along alaskas coast 
including into spectacularly scenic resurrection bay where oil has 
washed up on a beach at seward 
now the oil in the water is thickening and becoming more 
difficult to work with two coast guard skimmers were knocked out 
of action when the sludge fouled up their pumps 
we dont know how its going to work in this oil the kind of 
oil weve been skimming said coast guard capt rene roussel 
this will be first time the ship actually has worked on an oil 
spill said jim kross an environmental consultant hired to arrange 
for the ships services 
the vaidogubsky will ply alaskas waters for at least 30 days 
exxon will pay for its services estimated at 15000 a day plus 
expenses said james kross whose company works for veco exxons 
contractor 
fifteen thousand a day thats not much if its effective 
said cornett 
the 3yearold soviet vessel is a dredge firefighting platform 
and oil skimmer kross said it makes its money from dredging 
thats its primary function he said its a commercial boat 
the ship was built in finland and is stationed at sahaklin 
island its specifications indicate it can skim 200000 gallons of 
crude from the high seas each hour it has a 2 milliongallon 
capacity and will be accompanied by a barge to take off the oil 
when its tanks fills 
to skim the oil the vessel swings out a long pole on each side 
an oilgathering boom is attached to the poles and corrals oil as 
the vessel moves through the water kross said floating suction 
pumps are lowered into the captured oil and it is sucked into the 
vessels tanks 
jim simpson assistant to coast guard commandant paul yost said 
congress has been reluctant to pay for such a ship that might be 
used only once every 20 years 
i would suspect that after this incident the answer will be 
different he said 
seward is named for former secretary of state william seward 
the man who bought yetunexplored alaska from russia for 72 
million in 1867 doubters dubbed it sewards folly

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference with a group of reporters thursday 
bush fire away 
q mr president what are you going to do about the fact that 
sensitive and relevant documents were not reviewed by the 
irancontra committee 
a in the first place i have great confidence that ab 
culvahouse and those charged with cooperating with congress were 
cooperative 
ive seen nothing to indicate they werent 
secondly i would offer full cooperation for any requests made 
of this administration 
and i just cant confirm the hypothesis of your question at all 
q but you mean you would turn over any documents that they now 
want to see is that what youre saying 
a well procedures were set up to determine what documents 
would be made available 
those procedures were agreed to by the congress 
and certainly i would see that if any documents are in control 
of this administration relevant documents that we would live 
assiduously by those guidelines 
so i but i have no reason to believe that the previous 
administration the lawyers in it who worked closely with congress 
did not fulfill their obligations 
q well mr president were you an emissary to honduras as has 
been alleged 
a i went to honduras sure 
its a matter of public record 
q and did you inaudible a quid pro quo deal 
a i told you that im not going to discuss that until the trial 
with north is over 
and 
q but the jury is being sequestered today

riot troops ringed the house where adolf 
hitler was born and police said they arrested eight people thursday 
for marking the 100th anniversary of the dictators birth with nazi 
slogans and stiffarmed salutes 
hundreds of police swarmed this city of 17000 people to prevent 
a repeat of the 1979 clashes between neonazis and leftists that 
marked hitlers 90th birthday no serious incidents were reported 
across the border in west germany foreigners closed their 
stores and kept children out of schools because of fears of 
neonazi violence several members of antinazi vigilante groups 
were arrested for carrying weapons 
security was heaviest here at the twostory yellow house where 
hitler was born on april 20 1889 the house a former inn now used 
as a daycare center for handicapped children was sealed off with 
metal barriers manned by dozens of police and special riot squads 
with dogs 
about 50 to 100 onlookers stood nearby nearly all shops along 
the street were closed some barricaded with wooden boards 
police said unspecified numbers of people were being turned back 
at the border by west german or austrian border police 
a police spokesman said two austrians three italians two west 
germans and an american were arrested and face fines of up to 
2300 for their public behavior 
the italians one austrian and the american gave the nazi 
salute said a police official who did not give his name one west 
german was arrested after he shouted nazi slogans and spat at 
reporters police said he was carrying a large knife 
another west german also shouted antisemitic slogans including 
jew go and rot and this will be a national holiday in 100 
years time 
officials did not identify those arrested they were charged 
with misdemeanors 
on wednesday four americans an irishman and a west german were 
ordered by police to change their black boots and brown shirts 
garb reminiscent of nazi uniforms police said 
judging by what could have happened today i am happy with the 
security measures taken braunau mayor gerhard skiba said 
skiba defended an antifascist memorial he ordered put up in 
front of the hitler house two weeks ago 
i did not ask the city council because i knew that the 
rightwing freedom party and part of the conservative austrian 
peoples party were against it he said 
the memorial is made of granite from the quarry once worked by 
prisoners at the nearby nazi concentration camp of mauthausen 
for peace freedom and democracy never again fascism 
millions of dead warn reads the inscription 
braunau was quiet but at least four elderly people attracted 
clusters of people as they glorified the nazi past 
the first and second world wars were started because germany 
was economically strong too strong and neither east nor west 
wanted such an economic power said one 
in west berlin police arrested nine people who were driving 
around in cars apparently to defend against antinazi attacks 
police said they were carrying teargas pistols helmets clubs 
knives and other weapons 
west berlin police also said a turkish cemetery was vandalized 
early thursday with more than 38 grave stones were overturned or 
damaged 
peter frisch vicepresident of the federal office for the 
protection of the constitution in frankfurt said foreigners 
particularly turks are most vulnerable to attacks 
turks in recent years have flocked to west germany in search of 
jobs triggering resentment among many workingclass germans 
they the turks have assumed the role that the jews played in 
the nazi ideology frisch said on the north german radio station 
in hamburg districts that have large foreign populations a 
considerable number of parents kept their children out of 
schools a school spokesman said 
neonazi leaflets circulating in hamburg recently threatened 
violence against foreign schoolchildren 
some foreign shopowners closed their stores thursday in hamburg 
in oslo norway the dagbladet newspaper marked the day by 
publishing a survey that asked 50 children what they knew about 
hitler 
all said he started world war ii occupied norway and other 
countries for five years killed millions of jews and committed 
suicide when losing the war 
he was an evil man and probably insane one youngster wrote

abortion rights activists dumped some 200000 
letters at the justice department on thursday urging attorney 
general dick thornburgh to drop his attempt to have the supreme 
courts landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion overturned 
this has for the last 15 years been a legal struggle aclu 
executive director ira glasser said at a news conference outside 
the department where he was surrounded by the mailbags it has 
now become a political struggle 
the campaign to persuade the court not to reverse the 1973 roe 
vs wade decision concerns a missouri case known as webster vs 
reproductive health services the justice department which 
requested and received permission to file a brief in the case has 
asked the court not only to uphold a restrictive missouri abortion 
law but also to upend the 1973 decision 
the letters to thornburgh are among the many public expressions 
on both sides of the issue the national right to life committee 
plans to run fourpage inserts in newspapers around the country 
starting next tuesday more than 300000 prochoice demonstrators 
marched on washington on april 9 and americans in record numbers 
have been writing and telephoning the supreme court which hears 
arguments in the webster case on april 26 
however a court spokeswoman toni house said earlier this 
week while people have a right to write to the court i hope 
they do not expect that the enunciation of their opinion will have 
any effect on the justices 
dave runkel thornburghs spokesman said the department would 
accept the letters although he doubted they would change the 
antiabortion views held by thornburgh and president bush 
the attorney general believes that everyone has a right to 
petition the government he said 
rep pat schroeder dcolo who helped glasser and actor ed 
asner unload the mailbags from a pickup truck said the justice 
department should not be party to the arguments against a womans 
right to have an abortion 
traditionally the federal government has been leading the 
charge for constitutional rights she said to see them 
stepping backward and snuffing that torch is very distressing 
said asner george bush stated that he had thought long and 
hard on the serious subject of abortion every person in this 
country should be allowed the same freedom he had 
asner said he flew to washington from his los angeles home just 
for the mail delivery because i think its important for the 
country 
god knows i have my own history with abortion he said 
explaining only ive been involved with abortion as a youth i 
know too many people who were involved when it was illegal and when 
its legal and believe me legal is better 
mrs schroeder said the letters which came in response to ads 
placed in newspapers nationwide by the aclu have been one of the 
most phenomenal responses anyone has seen 
people have been like rip van winkle in the 1980s she said 
they suddenly woke up 
about 8000 people wrote personal letters but most were simply 
clippings from the ads many with personal notes attached the aclu 
said 
another prochoice group the national abortion rights action 
league began running television radio and newspaper ads wednesday 
to build on the energy displayed at the abortionrights march 
kate michelman executive director of naral said her groups ad 
campaign is not intended to lobby the supreme court but she said 
the court is not immune to the social values and political 
environment of the country 
the webster vs reproductive health services case concerns a 
missouri law that bars use of state funds for abortions and 
prohibits public employees from encouraging or performing 
or assisting an abortion the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
rejected key portions of the law last july 13 
the supreme court could act on the webster case without touching 
roe vs wade but the justice department in a brief filed in 
february urged the court to overturn the earlier ruling and leave 
decisions on abortions to the states

weapons that you apply to imported weapons 
a were in the process of discussing that now and what role 
the administration has whether its strictly restriction of 
imports or something broader than that 
q at this point are you convinced that any package that deals 
with drug violence and crime must also include some aspect that 
deals with assault weapons

fortyseven house members have asked president 
bush to reappoint dorcas hardy as social security commissioner to 
maintain a sense of stability in this critical program 
hardy has not been told whether she will be retained by bush 
but sources in the administration and on capitol hill said last 
week that the president is seriously considering replacing her 
a letter supporting hardy was circulated among house members by 
rep sherwood boehlert rny and sent to bush last week it was 
signed by 45 republicans and two democrats including rep andy 
jacobs dind chairman of the house ways and means social 
security subcommittee said hank price a spokesman for boehlert 
the lawmakers praised hardys initiatives in using tollfree 800 
numbers to get information to recipients and in distributing 
earnings and benefit estimate statements to participants 
the legislators that there are other service improvements and 
initiatives in the works that we dont want to see slowed or 
halted as would inevitably be the case with a change at the social 
securitys helm 
in view of the need to maintain a sense of stability in this 
critical program as well as the opportunity to continue moving 
boldly into the future we ask that she be given the opportunity to 
continue her fine work the letter concluded 
hardy had no comment on the letter said social security 
spokesman phil gambino 
hardy who was named to head the social security administration 
in 1986 by thenpresident reagan has been criticized recently by 
members of congress who say people calling the tollfree numbers 
often get only busy signals the critics also say the plan has 
required transferring staff from field offices to handle such 
calls leaving offices shorthanded 
a house governmental operations subcommittee wants to look at 
hardys travel records to see whether she combined business trips 
with vacations last december house democrats charged she had 
failed to implement a law requiring the administration to help 
homeless people receive benefit checks 
bush is considering replacing hardy with gwendolyn king a 
former legislative aide to sen john heinz rpa who later headed 
the washington office of dick thornburgh when thornburgh now the 
attorney general was governor of pennsylvania according to 
administration and capitol hill sources who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
king has declined to discuss the social security post but last 
week said i will be pleased to serve wherever the president 
needs me

a well i i would i dont no i cant say that 
i cant go that far because we really havent gotten that far 
in determining it 
q mr president a cbsnew york times poll this morning puts 
your approval rating at about 61 percent but suggests theres more 
substance or style than substance what do you think about that 
evaluation 
a you know my view on polls 
q i think that you and governor sununu have been briefed by a 
teeter poll thats been taken does that contain the same sort of 
information 
a no 
the teeter poll and im not sure its just because the 
committee paid for it is much stronger 
q higher rating laughter 
a higher higher higher 
im not i dont want this to be considered a vicious assault 
on cbs 
theyre entitled to their polling figures but the others were 
look these things you know me on polls john 
youve heard me on this subject before and i havent changed my 
view 
its not a question of polls but a question of whats going on 
are you achieving what youre trying to do 
and were making some progress here 
i was very pleased that the senate did what it did on the 
savings and loan bill pleased that we got a budget agreement that 
many cynics thought we could never achieve at all no matter how 
of what scope whatsoever 
that took place 
and so i think ive been very pleased with the recent talks on 
the middle east with three leaders there 
and so things are moving but i dont feel under any pressure to 
meet somebody elses standard on what is progress or not 
i know what im doing and i think the country i think one 
thing is the country senses that 
otherwise there wouldnt be that kind of support 
q mr president is there something coming up on military aid 
to the noncommunist resistance in cambodia 
a no 
no discussion of that yet no decision taken on that yet 
we continue to support give good support to the process and 
certainly to sihanouks efforts 
q you said no decision or inaudible 
a no decision and not with me cant recall but im not 
anywhere close to making a decision of that nature 
q were coming up to the 100day mark on your presidency 
which if you look over the past 50 years every other president 
or almost every other president has come into office in times of 
crisis and crisis has been kind of a stage on which we watch 
presidents perform how would you assess your first 100 days so 
far

the judge at oliver norths trial today began 
final proceedings as the jury prepared to deliberate the fate of 
the former white house aide on 12 criminal charges stemming from 
the irancontra affair 
us district judge gerhard a gesell was to instruct the jury 
on the legal principles it must apply in deciding whether north is 
innocent or guilty 
the court session followed a delay of several hours apparently 
over a news report that two jurors had not admitted involvement in 
unrelated court actions in the past 
one courthouse source said the delay stemmed from a story 
broadcast wednesday night that two jurors and an alternate had 
failed to mention prior court proceedings in which they had been 
involved the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
five alternates have sat with the 12member jury since opening 
statements in norths trial on feb 21 
abc news reported that two of the panelists caswell g 
hartridge 61 and helen g lynch 37 had been named as defendants 
in civil litigation involving accidents in the early 1980s 
both answered no on jury questionnaires asking them whether 
they had ever been involved as a party in any court 
proceedings civil or criminal 
abc also reported that the first alternate juror joseph l 
ward 33 who answered no to the same question had been 
arrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics 
he was placed on probation for a year the network said he also 
was arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasnt 
prosecuted it said 
in final arguments to the jury wednesday defense lawyer brendan 
sullivan declared that the government has not shown criminal 
behavior by north concluding i ask you to set him free 
but prosecutor john keker said north has refused to acknowledge 
that he did anything wrong even though he openly admits lying to 
congress and shredding evidence its time for you to do it for 
him keker told the jurors 
gesells jury instructions regarding criminal intent could 
determine whether norths defense stands or falls defense lawyers 
asked the judge to include several instructions favorable to north 
including that following orders in good faith negates criminal 
intent 
sullivan told the jury that president reagan used north as a 
sacrificial lamb when he fired the national security council aide 
on nov 25 1986 
the president was using ollie north as a scapegoat and threw 
him overboard to escape some political heat the defense lawyer 
said 
keker with a shakespearian flourish dismissed sullivans 
closing arguments as all sound and fury signifying nothing he 
said north clearly committed the criminal acts with which he is 
charged 
jury instructions could be especially important on the charge 
that north obstructed congress on aug 6 1986 by denying to the 
house intelligence committee that he was assisting the nicaraguan 
contras during a congressional ban on us aid to the rebels 
north testified that he lied to the panel but said he went to 
the meetingagainst his wishes on orders from national security 
adviser john poindexter poindexter subsequently sent north a note 
saying well done 
the defense also is relying on the fact that only sketchy notes 
were taken at the meeting and that north was not sworn to tell the 
truth during the session 
its almost like a trap said sullivan when they dont 
like what they hear and after a big investigation 2 years later 
lets charge ollie north with lying at the meeting 
jury instructions regarding criminal intent also could be 
critical on the charge that north illegally accepted a 13800 
security system from codefendant richard secord 
the fact that secord paid for the security system is uncontested 
ollie north is not a saint sullivan said in discussing that 
count but he said north had a wellfounded fear for his life after 
terrorist abu nidal targeted him for assassination 
sullivan said north tried to get some help from the 
government but was rebuffed 
isnt there a time in life when friends can still help out 
asked sullivan the government wants you to convict ollie north 
for accepting a security gate 
norths lawyers asked that the jury be instructed to acquit him 
on the count if it finds that he acted under duress 
other charges against north are that he lied to congress in 1985 
and the attorney general in november 1986 destroyed documents 
converted travelers checks to his own use and conspired to defraud 
the us treasury 
he faces a maximum 60 years in prison and 3 million in fines if 
convicted on all counts

a about the same as martin van burens 
q could you elaborate on that 
a martin came in 
he was not radically trying to change things but then thats 
about where the parallel ends because i dont know what he did in 
his first 100 days laughter 
q well do you know what he did the other 900 
a but no look weve got an agenda and ive clicked off 
things that i think are demonstrate progress 
and were i had left out the whole question of an ethics 
package that i think is a very good one 
weve had some many visitors from foreign lands 
weve moved forward on i want to add now to what i was saying 
move forward on third world debt in a in a positive way 
so i think that were were moving reasonably well 
and i dont i dont even think in terms of 100 days because 
we arent radically shifting things 
this is the martin van buren analogy 
we didnt come in here throwing the rascals out to try to do 
something correct all the ills of the world in 100 days 
now there are some ills of the world there are some unsolved 
problems and im methodically i think pragmatically moving 
forward on these 
so i i really dont measure it in terms of 100 days 
q but we i guess we are the ones who measure 
a you are 
you are 
q well foreign policy has been kind of held back youve had 
visitors but do you expect 
a i dont 
q the pace of your foreign policy to pick up after this 
a what what im not sure i understand the question 
the pace of it 
no 
i dont 
q well the question 
a the pace is pretty the pace of it is pretty intense 
numbers of visitors amount of time i spend on foreign policy 
initiatives taken by the secretary of state attention given to 
this in this in the white house every single day 
so i you see i i think weve got prudent foreign policy 
weve set into into forward motion certain reviews that are on 
moving towards completion 
and so i dont feel a a need for some precipitous and 
dramatic initiative in order to to solve this you know solve 
the consciences of those who are saying youve got to do something 
in 100 days 
q well let me let me go back 
q reviews wont trigger something greater than

india failed to launch its first 
intermediaterange ballistic missile thursday after the ignition 
system of the 7ton rocket developed a lastminute technical 
hitch military sources said 
the agni missile with a range of 1550 miles was scheduled to 
be launched from a remote seaside site in the eastern state of 
orissa where villagers were angered because they had to be 
evacuated from their homes 
we had to postpone the launch at the last stage said a 
senior military official at the chandipur launch site 745 miles 
southeast of new delhi the countdown had started but the 
computer reading showed a snag in the ignition system so we had to 
postpone the launching 
another military official said the postponement came as a 
shock 
we were depending on the scientists but at the last minute we 
were told that the launching would have been disastrous he said 
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said more than 200 scientists would work on the ignition 
system to prepare for a launch friday 
the agni is a demon said sarala das who said she would 
blow a conch shell during the launch we do not want a demon to 
be anywhere near us 
hindus believe the sound of a conch shell can drive out evil 
spirits 
villagers residing within a halfmile radius of the launch site 
said they were forcibly evacuated before the scheduled launch 
police came to our house at dawn and told us to get out 
said sideshwar jana a 40yearold farmer he said he did not want 
to leave his home but was forced out after police threatened to 
arrest him and his relatives 
about 400 villagers leading their goats and carrying their 
chickens walked to a relief center they had set up ignoring a 
government camp that offered free food and movies 
late thursday evening dozens of policemen visited the area to 
ensure it was evacuated 
arun dey a former legislator spearheading protests of the 
launch said he feared the villagers would react violently if they 
werent allowed to return home at night 
for a villager not to be in his home is like a turtle out of 
water dey said a fish out of water is dead but a turtle out 
of water is confused and lost 
a successful launch of the missile named agni or fire 
will rank india along with the united states the soviet union 
britain france and china in ballistic missile capabilities it 
also will enhance the power of indias 136 million army and its 
geopolitical influence in the region military experts say 
since april 1987 india has successfully tested three types of 
surfacetoair and surfacetosurface missiles with ranges varying 
from 5 miles to 155 miles 
military testfiring is nothing new in chandipur where the 
colonial british set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 years 
ago the area was chosen because of a rare geographical phenomenon 
during low tide water recedes by two miles which helps to retrieve 
the fired shells

jordans king hussein offered qualified 
support today for an israeli proposal for palestinian elections in 
the west bank and gaza strip as a first step toward ending the 
arabisraeli impasse 
after two hours of talks with secretary of state james a baker 
hussein told reporters at the state department the idea of an 
election might be worth looking at in the context of a 
comprehensive peace process 
he added that elections cannot be an end in themselves 
husseins carefully chosen words appeared to be his most 
positive statement about the israeli proposal since it was outlined 
here two weeks ago during a visit by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
shamir proposed that palestinians elect interlocutors to 
represent them in negotiations with israel for limited 
selfgovernment 
hussein said he was optimistic about the prospects for peace a 
sentiment he shared at a white house dinner wednesday night with 
baker president bush and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
i think there is a better chance for peace hussein told 
reporters after a sumptuous dinner of salmon duckling and other 
delicacies 
moments earlier bush said in a toast to his guest we can 
sense an urgency to the quest for peace now our task is to use 
that urgency to seize the moment 
in his toast hussein pleased his hosts by pledging to cooperate 
closely with the united states to achieve a just durable and 
comprehensive peace settlement 
we will support you in all your endeavors to achieve a 
comprehensive just and lasting peace he told bush 
because of jordans proximity to the west bank the 
administration regards husseins support for any peace process as 
essential for its success 
administration officials seemed pleased with husseins backing 
he had seemed content to play a more peripheral role in middle east 
diplomacy last summer when he severed jordans ties with west bank 
palestinians 
baker said that the beginning of a process is under way as a 
result of the talks with hussein and earlier visits here by both 
israeli prime minister yitzak shamir and egyptian president hosni 
mubarak 
it is important to do what he can to advance that process 
baker said 
shamirs election proposal is the newest element in the process 
and baker left the clear impression that the administration has 
carefully examined the kinds of issues that such an arrangement 
would entail 
left unanswered thus far he said are such questions as who 
would supervise elections in the territories who would be entitled 
to vote and would voting rights be extended to palestinians living 
outside the two areas 
although hussein did not give an outright endorsement to the 
proposal for elections baker said he was pleased with the 
responses of both hussein and mubarak to shamirs proposal 
scowcroft also present at the dinner said we have come a 
long way

a it could 
it might 
but i think gorbachev on the soviet eastwest relations 
understands what were about 
i frankly thought that what we said on poland the other day was 
a new and a strong initiative 
but that takes time to sort out these things 
but i didnt do it because i wanted to get in under the 100day 
wire 
now the question is weve spelled out what we want to do and 
now weve got to move our bureaucracy to see that we do it 
and you know its that its the kind of concept on the 
middle east 
spent a lot of time on the middle east and i think king hussein 
was right when he said yesterday that the time is right for some 
kind of action 
but now weve got to assess after he leaves here where we go 
and what next step we take 
weve got something out there on elections that offers some 
promise 
we havent backed away from historic positions on conference or 
whatever 
and so we move we take whatever the next step is 
i wish i could give you a more dramatic answer to the lebanon 
because this is one that really does hurt 
and im very very concerned about it 
and here all i can say to you is that we have encouraged the 
secretary general to go forward to try this mission of peace 
theres some stumbling blocks to that im told 
we will renew our call for removal of all foreign troops and for 
a ceasefire 
but here is one where i wish i had a that there was some 
dramatic plan in which the players in the area could agree to and 
its not there 
and weve talked to the middle eastern leaders 
but i cite this one because i really feel it about the lebanon 
and lebanons the divisions in lebanon 
weve talked to the brits about it weve talked to the french 
about it and mitterrand the other day and people at the un are 
trying to figure 
but there is not a dramatic plan that can bring peace to lebanon 
right now 
q is that a problem that defies solution 
a its a problem the shortrun of it how you stop this 
firing the shelling how you get factions to stop warring has 
certainly in recent times defied solution 
but we cant give up on it 
we simply are not going to 
q how does the us manage to provide any kind of influence 
with this 
a well thats the problem 
we dont have great influence in lebanon with the factions that 
are fighting 
we do have good influence with many of the countries out there 
in fact i think our standing with the moderate arab countries 
is as good today as any time in recent history 
and i feel strongly about that 
and back to the martin van buren theory i mean were building 
still coming back out of a time that hit a bit of a low on three 
or four years ago 
then we restored some prestige by the way we acted in the gulf 
then you see a ceasefire in the gulf

the soninlaw of the late soviet president leonid 
i brezhnev is serving his bribery sentence by lounging around a 
prison camp hospital a newspaper reported 
but the warden put his foot down when former deputy interior 
minister yuri churbanov indicated his idea of a prison uniform was 
an adidas warmup suit according to wednesdays editions of the 
newspaper socialist industry 
churbanov was convicted in december of taking bribes to protect 
a huge ring of corrupt officials in uzbekistan the prosecutor said 
in his trial that churbanov married brezhnevs daughter galina to 
ensure his rise in the interior ministry which controls the police 
churbanov is serving his 12year sentence in a special camp for 
former high officials kgb officers and policemen where there are 
about as many products in the camps store as in the citys the 
newspaper said that is a particularly telling point for soviet 
readers who complain that shop shelves are empty 
the newspaper said churbanov has not worked a single day in the 
six weeks since his arrival at the labor camp in nizhny tagil in 
the ural mountains 870 miles east of moscow 
a radiologist said he found a spot on churbanovs lung that 
could mean tuberculosis so the former deputy interior minister has 
been medically excused from work where there is gas or dust 
the newspaper said he probably will get a job in the library or 
kitchen it said 
for now he is occupying a private room in the prison infirmary 
despite churbanovs privileges however the camp chief denied 
his request to be allowed to keep his training suit in order to 
have something to wear to the doctors 
it was necessary to explain to the prisoner that in a 
reinforced regime colony adidas is hardly appropriate said

us trade representative carla hills told 
congress on thursday that the bush administration had achieved a 
breakthrough in worldwide trade liberalization talks but that 
months of hard bargaining remained to guarantee ultimate success 
i am delighted to report to you that the uruguay round 
negotiations are advancing once again she told the senate 
finance committee adding at another point we are now well 
positioned to undertake in earnest the final hard bargaining which 
will determine whether the uruguay round succeeds 
mrs hills appeared to be referring to agreements earlier this 
month in geneva that broke a fourmonth deadlock in trade 
negotiations with 100 other countries that are being held under the 
auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the talks known as the uruguay round had been in danger of 
collapsing after a meeting last december in montreal because of a 
failure to reach compromises in four key areas including a us 
demand to end all tradedistorting farm subsidies 
the united states agreed to compromise language in the 
agricultural area paving the way for compromises on the other 
disputed issues 
in addition to agriculture the talks had been deadlocked over 
the issues of trade in textiles ways to protect patented products 
from piracy and setting limits on the use of temporary trade 
restrictions to protect industries hurt by surges in imports 
mrs hills said the united states was satisfied that the 
language adopted in geneva in all of these areas set the stage for 
a successful completition of the negotiations which are aimed at 
opening up markets for the freer flow of trade between countries 
of particular concern to the united states is a landmark 
proposal included in the discussions that would for the first time 
establish rules for free trade in service industries such as 
banking engineering insurance and communications supporters hope 
that agreement in the service field where the united states has 
long excelled will help to lower americas huge foreign trade 
deficits 
sen lloyd bentsen the committee chairman asked mrs hills 
whether she believed the remaining 20 months was enough time to 
complete the talks given the wide range of topics to be settled 
the question of further delays in the negotiations is a 
serious concern he said even if all participants were eager 
to reach agreement the hard bargaining over substance is only just 
now beginning 
mrs hills said that she believed that the discussions would end 
on time even though past gatt rounds have been extended for up to 
four years 
we have an ambitious agenda and it is important given other 
initiatives underway that the uruguay round be concluded by 
december 1990 as agreed she said

and kissing on school property administrators said

return until they agree during a visit to the school with their 
parents to obey the rule said principal larry graham 
the suspended students were part of a group of 65 students who 
left the school wednesday morning to protest enforcement of a 
3yearold student councilapproved code of discipline that forbids 
overt displays of affection beyond handholding 
graham said the crackdown came in response to an increasing 
number of students hugging and kissing in the halls the behavior 
had become an embarrassment to faculty and other students he said 
the protesters complained they would not be allowed to hug each 
other after a sports victory or in times of grief graham said the 
rule does not apply in those cases students violating the rule

we have a i think much better communication now with jordan 
weve kept good cooperation and coordination with the egyptians 
the israelis themselves attest to the fact that they have great 
confidence in our administration 
we have some differences with all three of those countries 
but no i think its moving but nor am i i wish there was a 
shorterterm answer to stop the killing in lebanon 
q mr president 
a let me go around here 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater were going to 
have to make the president inaudible to go to the rose garden 
so terry this is going to be the last one or two questions 
bush one two three and thats it all right 
q youve missed the deadline a couple of times on the mx 
missile on what youre going to do to modernize the strategic 
arsenal to go with mx midgetman and you said cheney gave you 
some recommendations this week and a decision is expected this 
week what are you going to do on that 
a dont know yet but well obviously be talking to cheney when 
he comes back from nato 
but no decision has been taken 
q inaudible 
a well cant tell you that 
im listening because this exercise yesterday in this cabinet 
room was not just a semantic drill of some sort 
when i talk about cooperation with congress i mean it 
consultation with congress i mean it 
and some of what yesterday was about was getting the views of 
various members of congress on this decision facing the president 
but how do you you know what do you do about sdi levels of 
funding 
what do you do about mx or midgetman 
and i have to make the call the recommendation from here 
but i wanted to get their input 
now i want to get renewed talks with dick cheney when he comes 
back 
the national security adviser has provided me with a lot of 
thinking on this 
weve had several important briefings on it and i will be 
prepared very soon to make a decision on it 
but we havent i cant go any further than that 
brice 
q mr president youve met now with mubarak shamir and 
hussein what is the next step on these peace talks 
a not sure now 
on the table is the election process and one of the things 
would be how we flesh that out taking into consideration the 
concerns about it that have been expressed by mubarak and by king 
hussein and also by mr shamir 
so how we do that what the modalities are of that will be a 
lot of thought will be going into that whos represented making 
clear that this isnt a final step that that isnt going to solve 
the middle east problem making clear that its a step that we 
want it to be a constructive step and exploring other options as

nato defense ministers thursday gave 
only limited support to an american plan to upgrade nuclear arms in 
europe again putting off tough decisions on the politically 
charged issue 
but defense secretary dick cheney said he was satisfied with the 
endorsement by ministers attending a twoday nuclear strategy 
session of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
he predicted the support voiced in a carefully crafted 
statement would enable the defense department to win congressional 
approval for more money to develop the new generation 
surfacetosurface missile 
i am reluctant to make hard and fast predictions about what 
congress will or wont require he said on the flight back to 
washington 
but i will take the language that weve got and do the best i 
can to garner the necessary support he said and im 
reasonably confident that that will work 
in advance of the meeting us officials had said privately 
they wanted a stronger signal from allies to continue the 
development program but the lukewarm backing was virtually the 
same as that given at last falls nuclear strategy meeting in the 
netherlands 
the statement said natos strategy will continue to require 
for the foreseeable future a mix of conventional and nuclear 
arms 
at this meeting we again expressed our determination to 
ensure that nato possesses diversified survivable and 
operationally flexible nuclear forces across the entire spectrum 
the ministers said 
these forces must be kept uptodate where necessary they 
said 
george younger britains secretary of state for defense said 
the statement paves the way for decisions to be taken as they 
become necessary in the future 
what it hasnt done is to step back in any way from the 
general nato strategy he told reporters 
president bush and other nato leaders will meet may 2930 in 
brussels to consider among other things the comprehensive 
concept a blueprint to guide the allies future strategy for arms 
control and force planning 
nato officials were expected to spend the weeks leading up to 
the summit trying to find language that will bridge the differences 
over the modernization question 
with warming eastwest ties the idea of upgrading the lance has 
become increasingly unpopular especially in west germany where 
most of the weapons would be based 
the lance missile which was introduced in 1972 will become 
obsolete in 1995 military analysts say 
it has a range of a little more than 60 miles the upgraded 
missile would have a range of about 250 miles 
west german chancellor helmut kohl wants to delay the decision 
on modernization until 1991 or 1992 after important elections in 
his country 
by 1991 or 1992 obviously we would hope to have been able to 
arrive at specific decisions with respect to what new nuclear 
systems would be deployed cheney told a news conference at nato 
headquarters 
we clearly are not there yet its not required yet so for 
that reason im comfortable with what we have in this 
communique he said 
belgium and some other european nations would like the alliance 
to enter into early negotiations with the sovietled warsaw pact on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
the united states and britain strongly oppose such a move 
saying emphasis should be placed on current eastwest bargaining to 
reduce conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe

the united nations will send another 
convoy of food to starving masses in southern sudan this time 
along a different route than the treacherous path traveled by an 
earlier convoy a spokesman said thursday 
the convoy will be the second initiated by the united nations 
since launching operation lifeline sudan on april 1 seven people 
died when the first convoy to the rebelheld region was attacked 
tuesday 
the new 47truck convoy is to carry 1100 tons of maize from 
ugandas capital kampala on the twoday trip to the sudanese city 
of nimule un spokesman paul mitchell said nimule is just across 
the border from uganda 
the relief effort aims to avert 100000 famine deaths by 
stocking more than 110000 tons of food in southern sudan before 
heavy rains begin in midmay 
but the operation has been plagued with delays caused by 
political difficulties bad weather and equipment shortages un 
officials concede they are unlikely to meet their goal before the 
rainy season which lasts through october 
mitchell said the united nations hoped the convoy would leave 
friday but that delays were possible 
there are so many variables in this part of the world that we 
dont like to say until it actually goes said mitchell 
he said the northern ugandan area through which the convoy would 
travel is somewhat insecure but un officials did not 
anticipate any problems 
the first un convoy carried 110 tons of food and supplies from 
the northern kenyan town of lokichoggio through the sudan peoples 
liberation armys rebel base at kapoeta 
it was heading to the rebelheld town of torit when it was 
attacked seven rebel escorts died and the lead truck in the 
14vehicle convoy was destroyed 
un officials have suspended the overland route to torit 
indefinitely due to the attack but say an airlift to the 
rebelheld town may begin friday from the ugandan city of entebbe 
officials thursday still had not assessed blame for tuesdays 
attack but speculation centered on nomadic tribal warriors 
government troops or government militias operating against the 
rebel group 
the sudan peoples liberation army took up arms against sudans 
moslemdominated government in khartoum in 1983 seeking greater 
autonomy and more economic development for the predominantly 
christian and animist south

a trade association of insurance companies 
thursday called for a truce in the war of words with consumer 
groups and cooperation in efforts to reform state auto insurance 
laws 
the alliance of american insurers made up of 107 companies 
suggested 14 ways to change state laws some proposals have long 
had industry support such as advocating strict nofault laws 
while others won endorsement for the first time such as allowing 
customers the choice between nofault and conventional policies 
we are calling on the consumer groups with whom we share many 
ideals and the rest of our industry to work with us said 
franklin w nutter president of the alliance what we offer is a 
truce in the war of words 
member companies of the alliance write 10 percent to 12 percent 
of auto insurance nationwide the group includes such major 
companies as liberty mutual and kemper other major auto insurers 
such as geico and state farm are not members 
reaction from consumer groups was reserved 
where were they a year ago or five years ago when ralph nader 
and clarence ditlow head of the center for auto safety where 
fighting in the trenches asked robert hunter header of the 
national insurance consumer organization an advocacy group nader 
helped organize 
but hunter added i have no problem in working together in 
things we agree on 
joan claybrook director of public citizen an advocacy group 
that nader also helped found said i think this is a political 
reaction to being zapped by proposition 103 in california to a 
successful ballot initiative of last fall now under court 
challenge that requires auto premium rollbacks 
since the industrys desired changes vary from state to state 
nutter said he could not offer an estimate of cost savings that 
could follow from the alliances program but he said we are 
fully convinced that these proposals based on the experience of a 
variety of cities where insurance practices were studied will 
lower the costs of claims and settlements 
the 14 points 
nofault laws with strong restrictions on lawsuits such laws 
are in effect in michigan new york and florida motorists recover 
their losses from their own insurers instead of suing the other 
motorist involved in a crash 
failing that allowing buyers to chose between nofault and 
conventional policies 
tightening of uninsured motorist laws 
stronger antifraud and antitheft programs including possible 
inspections of cars before policies are issued 
renewed efforts to reduce repair costs including restoration 
of requirements that bumbers withstand five miles per hour crashes 
insurer referral to cooperating repair shops and continued use of 
replacement parts not made by the original manufacturer 
an end to double collection of benefits from both auto and 
medical insurance policies 
greater involvement by auto insurers in efforts to control 
increasing medical costs 
consumer information programs including possible information 
on newcar stickers about the instances of theft ease of repair 
and claim frequencies of similar models 
better organization of assigned risk pool coverage 
more funds for state insurance departments 
more involvement by insurers in land use and transportation 
planning in urban areas including support for mass transit 
better law enforcement including restoration of the 55 mph 
speed limit 
better vehicle design including support for air bags tougher 
standards for side impact and rollover protection and extension of 
auto safety standards to light trucks and vans 
opposition to laws limiting competition among insurers 
on the last point nutter said directors of the alliance had 
instructed the staff to examine with agent organizations such 
topics as repealing laws forbidding the sale of group auto 
insurance

president virgilio barco said thursday 
he is creating a 1000man force to wipe out rightwing death 
squads run by drug traffickers 
the death squads have killed about 1500 people in colombia in 
the last five years most victims have been leftist sympathizers 
barco announced the new squad in a televised address wednesday 
night and released details thursday 
barco said the squads are threatening democracy and sabotaging 
talks between the government and leftist guerrillas 
these groups are not just common criminals barco said 
they are real terrorist organizations supported and financed 
mainly by drug traffickers 
the criminal acts are carried on a pretext of anticommunism 
and the fight against the guerrillas he said in reality the 
majority of the people who have been victims of these terrorist 
acts are not guerrillas 
they are men women and even children who have not taken up 
weapons against the government they are peaceful colombians 
colombia asked the united states britain israel and italy to 
help train antiterrorist troops justice minister guillermo plazas 
said last week after a trip to washington 
in the last year death squads have attacked entire villages a 
dozen times shooting at random 
the worst such attack came nov 11 when a death squad firing 
submachine guns killed 43 people in the northwest town of segovia 
barco said the special force will draw from all government 
security forces and will be directed by the head of the national 
police the national police force is part of the armed forces 
barco said he also will create a national commission to take 
even more measures to combat the death squads 
the president said 23 of the estimated 150 death squads in 
colombia have been dismantled and 50 of their gunmen have been 
arrested so far this year 
it was not until after the massacre in segovia that the 
government began to act against the death squads 
since then government reports have shown that the death squads 
are run by drug traffickers with the help of cattlemen and other 
land owners and policemen and soldiers acting on their own 
about 30 members of the national police and the army face 
charges this year for allegedly helping death squads

q how do you what is the structure 
a well we have the on the us side we use the national 
security council procedures to do that 
and of course we i plan to be in touch with the various 
leaders 
ive told them i want to do that as president and i do plan to 
talk personally with some of the leaders out there on these matters 
 
q is this 
a in addition to the ones i already talked to 
for example i talked to king faud the other day 
and i think that that is useful to be sure now after this 
round of visits what do they think 
a lot of these countries can be important players here and the 
more agreement we can get on the next step the more likely it is 
to succeed 
last lesley 
q mr president on the uss iowa is it time to say that 
50yearold battleships are in fact obsolete and to begin taking 
them out of service is that the lesson here or whats your lesson 
on this 
a no thats not well my lesson is that to find out what 
happened in infinite detail check all procedures to be sure that 
safety is at the highest point and but not i wouldnt jump to 
the conclusion that because that kind of powder is put into these 
turrets in that way that that obsolete that that makes a useful 
platform obsolete 
im not going to go that far 
q could you indulge me one quick question for the conflict with 
the attorney general 
a come on john give me a break 
q one quickly the attorney general 
a is this for tv or is this for the print 
q both the attorney general suggested yesterday that it might 
be appropriate to drug test people in public housing hud took 
immediate exception to that what do you think 
a id have to talk to him about it because i dont know and 
im not going to go off on some tangent here until i know exactly 
the thinking of our key cabinet people 
weve got a good cabinet system and i encourage people to speak 
out but the decisions on something of that nature will be made 
right here in that room 
and theyre not going to be made until i have all of the facts 
q do you expect interest rates to come down now that youve 
passed a budget agreement scattered laughter 
a i was very pleased with the market reaction to the budget 
agreement 
it seems to have been underreported 
but nevertheless very heartening terry 
q how about the interest rates you said during the campaign 
a im not heartened by the interest rates scattered laughter 
q inaudible to say about drug testing for the federal 
employees 
a on selective ways yes absolutely 
q selective like 
a well weve already got some patterns out there 
q inaudible where 
a well widely 
if were talking about drugfree workplace weve got to have 
some testing and i support that 
this idea that this is total infringement on everybody i dont 
agree 
now in some cases i mean i dont want it to have be so 
widespread but i do think its selective drug testing is very 
important and nobody will change my mind on that one 
q civil rights being lost 
a civil rights is very important too 
so is the law 
the press thanks mr president

an asteroid big enough to wipe out cities 
whizzed past the earth last month before astronomers even knew it 
was there showing how hard it is to forecast a natural disaster 
from space a nasa scientist said thursday 
the mountainsized asteroid flashed by the earth at a speed of 
46000 miles an hour and was not even detected until days after it 
had become only a receding point of light the national aeronautics 
and space administration announced 
astronomers reported that the object missed the earth by only a 
half million miles about twice the distance between the earth and 
moon in cosmic terms this is considered a close call 
had it hit the earth said bevan french a scientist in nasas 
solar system exploration division the asteroid would have created 
a crater the size of the district of columbia and spread 
destruction for 100 miles in all directions other effects would be 
felt thousands of miles away he said 
the object would be packing the equivalent of 40 billion tons 
of tnt said french that would be equal to about 40000 
hydrogen bombs all going off at the same time 
henry holt a retired us geological survey scientist now 
working on a nasafunded project to detect and track asteroids that 
cross the earths orbit found the asteroid in photographs taken 
almost a week after it had flown past 
french said the fact that the asteroid called 1989fc was not 
seen earlier comes as no surprise 
these detections are made because you can photograph a trail 
of light as it moves against a background of fixed stars said 
french that means the asteroid is moving across your path and 
not on a collision course 
an asteroid that was heading right for you would look just 
like another small fixed star and might be very difficult to detect 
until it was too late to do anything about it he said 
there have been several federally funded studies to determine 
how to protect the earth from being bombed by outer space rocks 
but little else has been done said french 
your best bet would be to identify these several hundred or 
thousand earth crossers asteroids and calculate their orbit he 
said then you would know when you are in danger 
once the approaching object was sighted said french then you 
could launch a large nuclear device to explode near the asteroid 
and nudge it out of the way 
but for now said the nasa scientist we dont really have the 
kind of detection capability or launch capability to do that at the 
moment 
french said holt found the object in photos taken on march 31 by 
an 18inch telescope at the mount palomar observatory in 
california the photos were processed several days later and the 
asteroid was discovered by comparing views taken an hour apart 
by the time the object was photographed french said it had 
already made its closest approach to earth and was streaking 
outward away from the sun scientists plotted the trajectory 
backward and determined that the asteroid passed within a half 
million miles of earth on march 23 
on the cosmic scale of things that was a close call holt 
said in the nasa announcement of the event 
asteroid 1989fc came closer to earth than any other object so 
large since the pass in 1937 of an object called hermes that 
object went by earth at about the same distance as 1989fc 
french said that if 1989fc had impacted dry land on earth it 
would be a very major catastrophe for which we have had no 
experience 
if the asteroid had hit the ocean he said it would have 
created tidal waves that would wash over vast areas of coastal 
regions 
french said that there may be hundreds to thousands of such 
earthcrossing asteroids and that such an object the size of 1989fc 
could reasonably be expected to impact the earth every 5 million to 
20 million years 
he said there is a crater in ghana and one in the soviet union 
created by such objects hitting the earth the soviet crater is 
thought to be less than a million years old 
scientists also believe that an object about six miles in 
diameter hit the earth about 65 million years ago and ejected so 
much debris into the atmosphere that it caused the planet to cool 
a popular theory blames this event for the extinction of the 
dinosaurs 
french said that 1989fc is in an orbit that crosses the orbits 
of earth mars and venus he said the asteroid is moving away from 
the sun now but will pass within 20 million miles of the earth 
early in october 
experts now are tracking the asteroid to gain a more refined 
estimate of its orbit french said 1989fc passed close enough to 
the earth for its orbit to be affected by the planets 
gravitational influence scientists will have to take this into 
account when calculating the asteroids new orbit

contra leaders thursday denied delaying the 
dismissal of a commander convicted of human rights violations and 
accused the united states of unfairly threatening to cut off aid to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
the issue arose when the rebels agreed to suspend the head of 
contra intelligence jose benito bravo centeno known as 
commandante mack after a military tribunal convicted him of 
torturing and killing suspected infiltrators from the countrys 
leftist sandinista government 
mack was supposed to be relieved of duty while appealing the 
conviction but reporters recently saw him at a contra camp in 
honduras and spotted his car outside the headquarters of the 
intelligence unit 
on tuesday a spokesman for the state department warned that the 
united states could cut off the nicaraguan rebels 50 million aid 
which congress granted only for nonlethal purposes if they did 
not carry out the sentence as agreed 
i think thats unfair contra director roberto ferrey 
responded thursday at the rebels miami headquarters we are 
saying that human rights should be respected and the accused also 
has human rights in the us the accused has the right of appeal 
there is nothing tricky going on 
ferrey said under contra procedures macks appeal has to go 
before the seven civilian directors he added that the directorate 
was trying to expedite the case and hoped for a final decision on 
macks punishment or expulsion by the end of april 
the director denied mack was continuing to work while suspended 
but acknowledged he remains at the camp in honduras 
the person has been separated from his daily duties but he 
can still be at the camp he doesnt have anyplace else to go 
ferrey said 
several members of congress have made the mack issue central to 
their support for continuing the 50 million aid package signed 
tuesday by president bush under the law congress must certify 
that the contras are respecting human rights and honoring truce 
agreements reached as part of a central american peace plan 
ferrey said macks was the only major human rights violation 
case working its way through the contra appeal procedure

the rocky mountain region for the first time 
replaced the southeast at the bottom of the nations per capita 
income scale last year as its income growth was held back by 
weakness in oil and gas exploration the government reported 
thursday 
per capita personal income in the rocky mountain states averaged 
14282 last year 13 percent below the national average of 
16444 new england meanwhile claimed the top slot for the fifth 
straight year with income of 20013 22 percent above the 
national average 
it was the widest gap since 1969 between the highest and lowest 
regions based on per capita income as a percent of the us 
average the commerce department reported 
it also continued the pattern of the nations sixyearold 
economic expansion in which per capita income has grown faster 
than average in the highincome regions and has advanced slower 
than average in lowincome regions 
the highincome states are still moving further away above 
the us average and the lowerincome states are moving further 
away below the average said rudolph depass a commerce 
department analyst 
on a statebystate basis connecticut claimed the top spot for 
the third straight year in 1988 with average per capita income of 
22761 while mississippi remained in the basement with average 
income of 10992 
mississippi has been last in every year for which the commerce 
department has records stretching back to 1929 except for 1933 
when south dakota briefly bumped it out of cellar 
last year was the first time the southeast with average income 
of 14331 did not rank last among the eight regions income 
growth in the southeast matched the national average last year of 
62 percent while its replacement on the bottom rung the rocky 
mountains saw income grow by 54 percent 
when the national figures are adjusted for inflation average 
per capita income grew 2 percent last year up from the 14 percent 
pace in 1987 
depass said the gap between high and lowincome areas has 
widened even as income growth slows down in highincome states and 
accelerates elsewhere 
for example per capita income in new england grew 78 in 1988 
down from 82 percent in 1987 at the same time last years 54 
pace of growth in the rocky mountain states was up from 36 percent 
in 1987 
the commerce department said growth in the rocky mountain states 
and in the southwest where per capita income of 14365 was up 52 
percent in 1988 was held back by slow oil and gas exploration 
income growth advanced even more slowly in the plains states 
where per capita income of 15495 advanced just 48 percent 
reflecting the weak farm economy 
the growth of per capita income in new england and the middle 
atlantic regions meanwhile was bolstered by rapidly expanding 
service and construction payrolls combined with belowaverage 
population growth 
among the topranking states connecticut was followed by new 
jersey with per capita income of 21882 massachusetts 20701 
alaska 19514 and maryland 19314 
the district of columbia would have ranked third if it had been 
ranked along with the states with per capita income of 21667 
last year 
at the other end of the list mississippi was followed by west 
virginia 11658 utah 12013 arkansas 12172 louisiana 
12193 and south dakota 12475 
south dakota and north dakota were the only states in which per 
capita income fell last year dropping 06 percent in the former 
and 19 percent in the latter to 12720

king hussein of jordan said thursday an 
israeli proposal for palestinian elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip could advance peace in the middle east if it is part of 
a broader negotiating effort 
standing with secretary of state james a baker iii after two 
hours of talks at the state department hussein appeared to be more 
positive about the election proposal than he had been previously 
but he stopped short of a full endorsement 
it is not an end in itself he told reporters 
but he said the idea of election might be worth looking at 
within the context of the whole process that hopefully will come 
together to get us from where we are now to a final settlement 
otherwise the idea is out of context 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir made the proposal during a 
visit here two weeks ago suggesting that palestinians in the 
occupied territories choose interlocutors to represent them in 
talks with israel on limited selfgovernment the territories have 
been wracked by violence for almost a year and a half 
the bush administration has said elections would be appropriate 
so long as they lead to negotiations to determine the final status 
of the territories 
husseins visit caps two weeks of intensive negotiations that 
have included visits by egyptian president hosni mubarak as well as 
shamir 
hussein said he is more optimistic as a result of his current 
visit than he has been in many many years his upbeat mood is 
shared by top administration officials based on comments offered 
wednesday night at a white house dinner in husseins honor 
president bush said in a toast to hussein we can sense an 
urgency to the quest for peace now our task is to use that urgency 
to seize the moment 
in his toast hussein pleased his hosts by pledging to cooperate 
closely with the united states to achieve a just durable and 
comprehensive peace settlement 
we will support you in all your endeavors to achieve a 
comprehensive just and lasting peace he told bush 
because of jordans proximity to the west bank the 
administration regards husseins support for any peace process as 
essential for its success 
administration officials appeared delighted with husseins 
backing he had seemed content to play a more peripheral role in 
middle east diplomacy last summer when he severed jordans ties 
with west bank palestinians 
baker said wednesday night that the beginning of a process 
is under way as a result of this months discussions 
it is important to do what he can to advance that process 
baker said 
shamirs election proposal is the newest element in the process 
and baker left the clear impression that the administration has 
carefully examined the kinds of issues that such an arrangement 
would entail 
left unanswered thus far he said are such questions as who 
would supervise elections in the territories who would be entitled 
to vote and whether voting rights should be extended to 
palestinians living outside the two areas

the bush administration plans to collect 245 
billion from profits of companies making ozonedestroying 
chemicals but a house committee chairman says it looks like a tax 
and thats a job for congress 
the administration doesnt call it a tax against makers of 
environmentally damaging chemicals but to rep john d dingell 
chairman of the house energy and commerce committee it appears to 
be an attempted end run around the taxing authority of congress 
the money would be collected either by a fee favored by the 
environmental protection agency or by auctioning the rights to 
produce the chemicals a proposal developed by the office of 
management and budget 
dingell a michigan democrat said he hasnt decided whether 
siphoning off the profits is a bad idea but hes making a lot of 
negative comments about it 
he said the administration has no specific authority to 
collect the money that courts view the taxing power of 
government narrowly that hes not sure house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill would approve and 
that i was reading mr bushs lips like everyone else when the 
president said he opposed new taxes 
before i come to a conclusion i want to hear from a union 
whose plant is going to be shut down dingell said adding it 
is contingent on congress enacting it the people accepting it and 
the courts approving it 
the manufacturers are not happy either theyll be sued we 
will challenge it for sure said tony vogelsberg an official 
with du pont the largest maker of the chemicals 
targets for the revenueraising are windfall profits chemical 
firms could make after an international treaty reduces supplies of 
chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs which poke holes in the ozone 
layer and increase the risk of skin cancer industry is developing 
substitutes but those wont be ready for production for an 
estimated three to five years 
omb has budgeted 400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990 15 
billion in 1991 and 550 million in 1992 the firstyear revenue 
figures survived an overall budget agreement between congressional 
negotiators and the administration 
we will get that 400 million somehow one way or another 
vowed omb spokeswoman barbara clay referring to the firstyear 
projected revenues you have to base the argument for windfall 
profits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreases 
and demand remains constant 
omb and epa have been arguing about how to collect the money 
but they agree and the industry denies that there eventually 
will be windfall profits for manufacturers when the nation begins 
implementing the 1987 montreal protocol to cut production of cfcs 
the governments theory is that demand will far outstrip supply 
some months after july when production must be frozen at 1986 
levels the montreal protocol requires that by 1998 production can 
be only 50 percent of 1986 figures 
despite the race to develop substitutes by the five 
manufacturers of cfcs epa spokesman chris rice said the companies 
may not hurry to produce them if theyre making windfall profits on 
current cfcs 
the companies will be making 20 percent less starting this 
year and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent rice said 
they can bring in an incredible amount of money were afraid 
they will have the incentive because of the profit to stall to 
delay introduction of the substitutes 
vogelsberg said we dont see windfall profits as really being 
there 
if i say i have a monopoly position and im going to raise the 
price youre going to remember what i did to you i want to 
maintain a longterm business relationship we will not charge more 
than our cost justifies 
cfcs are used in refrigerators large airconditioning units and 
car airconditioners high energy foam insulation for modern 
construction solvents for cleaning computer components and 
cushions in seats and sofas

pope john paul ii on thursday met with 
president patrick j hillery of ireland calling for courageous 
gestures of reconciliation to stop the sectarian bloodshed in 
northern ireland 
the pope urged all parties in the conflict to find a political 
accord that will respect the legitimate rights and aspirations of 
all the people of northern ireland 
signs of hope are not lacking and we shall pray and be 
confident that a process guided by reason and mutual acceptance 
will not be long in bringing an end to bloodshed and the secure 
advent of a just reconciliation and peaceful reconstruction john 
paul said in english 
the pope who visited ireland in 1979 described the country as 
on the whole a warm and loving society secure in the rule of 
law and rooted in the highest ideals of justice freedom and 
peace 
but he decried the deadly climate of intimidation and violence 
which has caused so much suffering to both communities in northern 
ireland during the past 20 years 
only a genuine willingness to engage in dialogue and 
courageous gestures of reconciliation goes to the heart of the 
underlying causes of the present complex situation of conflict 
he said 
the irish republican army for many years has waged a bloody 
campaign to drive the british out of northern ireland and united it 
with the predominantly roman catholic irish republic violence has 
also been carried out by protestant extremists 
the pope said each ethnic and religious group has a right to 
protect its identity but must also judge its claims in light of 
historical reality and the present reality 
not to do so would involve the risk of remaining prisoners of 
the past without prospects for the future he said 
hillery who met with the pope for 30 minutes said some 
progress toward reconciliation had been made in recent years but 
that a small minority continued the violence 
only too aware of the suffering occasioned by fratricidal 
strife and the blindness of ignorance and hate we share strongly 
your belief that violence is no solution to conflict hillery 
said

when paramedic kim roderick went looking 
for a charity to take the proceeds from sales of a calendar 
featuring paramedics women of the bay area she expected a warm 
welcome 
but she said at least a halfdozen organizations gave her a cold 
shoulder and called it sexist when she raised the idea almost two 
years ago 
one said they didnt think it would generate enough money but 
they were really concerned about the exploitation of females she 
said wednesday i didnt believe i couldnt even give my money 
away 
roderick declined to identify the charities that turned her down 
the fullcolor calendar depicts 12 female paramedics at work and 
at play including a shot of roderick as ms may getting ready for 
a night out 
we didnt want to go out and do an exploitive number with 
lingerie and garter belts roderick said i made an effort not 
to do that 
finally administrators at the ronald mcdonald house for 
critically ill children and their families in palo alto about 20 
miles south of san francisco agreed to endorse the project 
but roderick 26 laments that sales were slow until a national 
television magazine show featured the calendar earlier this week 
men wanted more skin and some women were a little upset she 
said 
the calendars 10000 of which were printed have been available 
since november but only about 3000 were sold before the price was 
cut from 10 to 5 this month said to marti hirsch a spokeswoman 
for ronald mcdonald house 
poses include uniformed paramedics relaxing in the back of an 
ambulance and talking on the radio a paramedic in a bathing suit 
and tank top posing as a lifeguard and another in a bodysuit 
working out in a gym 
frank mcmahan who supervises about 80 fulltime members of the 
san francisco paramedic team said he thought the calendar gives 
females a bad image 
a paramedic brought a calendar to the office but mcmahan said 
he kept it in a drawer the women in the unit have not even seen 
em and we dont want them to see em in fact the one in the 
drawer was probably thrown away 
roderick defended the project as an attempt to highlight 
underpublicized paramedics in addition to raising money for 
charity

the birth defect spina bifida will leave 13000 
children born in this decade struggling with its effects at an 
annual cost of 100 million federal health researchers predicted 
thursday 
each year about 1500 children are born in the united states 
with spina bifida the incomplete closing of the bony structure 
surrounding the spinal cord more than 1000 survive into 
childhood often at tremendous medical expense the national 
centers for disease control said in its weekly report thursday 
an estimated 9800 children born with spina bifida from 1980 to 
1987 were still alive in 1987 the cdc reported by the end of 
1990 that number is expected to grow to an estimated 13000 
in 1990 the average annual cost for medical and surgical care 
for all surviving children born with spina bifida since 1980 will 
approach 100 million the atlantabased cdc reported 
further the number of surviving spina bifida patients born 
before 1980 is as large as those born after 1980 it is likely 
that their costs would equal or exceed those of the post1980 
patients the cdc said 
spina bifida often strikes along with anencephaly the absence 
of major parts of the brain in that case most patients die a few 
hours after birth 
for the spina bifida patients who do survive life is expensive 
infants with spina bifida routinely receive vigorous medical 
therapy and undergo repeated surgical procedures to survive and 
reach their maximum functional capacity the cdc said the 
lifetime costs for such a patient can reach 250000 according to 
a 1985 north carolina study cited by the federal researchers 
the cause of spina bifida is unknown but the disease rate is 
decreasing from a rate of 52 cases per 10000 births in 1980 to 
43 in 1987 
nobody really knows why its really quite incredible said 
dr david erickson a cdc birth defects specialist some of the 
decrease is due to new hightechnology prenatal testing which gives 
more mothers the option of terminating problem pregnancies but 
that doesnt explain all of it he said 
a previous cdc study found 50 percent fewer spina bifida cases 
among women who took multivitamins during pregnancy but 
researchers havent yet determined if that was the cause or if 
those women had other characteristics reducing their childrens 
risk 
the cdc has declined to recommend widespread multivitamin 
treatments for pregnant women without firmly knowing that its 
going to do something thats not good policy erickson said

the state department acting under court 
decisions banning sex discrimination is revamping its entrance 
exam and informing about 600 female foreign service officers they 
may be entitled to new jobs it was disclosed on thursday 
state department spokesman richard boucher discussing the 
agencys response to a suit that dates back 13 years said 
secretary of state james a baker iii is firmly committed to 
ensuring that there be no discrimination in the department of state 
of any kind if past policies have contradicted this position they 
must and will be changed 
boucher told reporters that the department sent cables to us 
embassies around the world and planned to inform employees of a 
us district court ruling that the department has discriminated 
against women in the foreign service dating back to 1976 
the spokesman said the notification was sent to comply with a 
court order issued jan 31 and outlines remedies to be provided 
they include he said ensuring that there is no 
discrimination against women in the future regarding assignments 
performance evaluation occupational specialties and superior 
honor awards 
he added that the department is revamping its entrance exam for 
foreign service officers because of a separate court order 
finding that the written exam has adversely affected women weve 
decided that that must change and it will change 
the actions stem from a suit filed in 1976 by alison palmer a 
nowretired foreign service officer who claimed the department 
discriminated against women in hiring and promotion said ms 
palmers attorney monica wagner 
the suit alleged the department discriminated against women by 
hiring more men giving men the better career assignments and more 
careeradvancing performance ratings and honor awards 
under the order a woman is eligible for relief if she can show 
that she sought or would have sought absent discrimination any 
of the departments better assignments 
if cases of discrimination are found the court order requires 
the department to allow women to transfer to other job areas be 
offered other assignments and raise their performance ratings 
ms wagner said her client will not be a direct beneficiary of 
the court order because she has retired only those women who are 
part of the classaction suit and are still working for the foreign 
service are affected 
the benefit for her is in seeing the state department take 
action with respect to the sex discrimination found by the court 
ms wagner said 
ms wagner said some 600 women may be entitled to the 
courtordered relief 
boucher was asked by a reporter whether baker planned to 
demonstrate his commitment to womens rights by naming more 
women to highlevel state department posts 
so far baker has named one woman as an assistant secretary of 
state his longtime aide margaret tutwiler who is the assistant 
secretary of state for public affairs 
you mean like my boss bocher responded drawing laughter 
from the journalists 
boucher noted that baker had issued a statement on equal 
opportunities shortly after taking office and that not all 
positions had been filled 
in any case hes very firmly committed to this its a 
matter of great importance to him and im sure he will carry it 
out fully said boucher 
the state department had won the palmer lawsuit in a lower court 
but was reversed three months ago by the us court of appeals for 
the district of columbia 
boucher said the state department has filed a notice of intent 
to appeal the case but added this was done in order to preserve 
that option if its appropriate after a full review by the 
department and the department of justice

a plague of desert locusts that has lasted for more 
than two years and aggravated food shortages in africa is virtually 
over a un agency said thursday 
a continuing decline in desert locust populations in africa 
and the near east indicates that the current plague has virtually 
collapsed the un food and agriculture organization said 
the locust plague which began in the summer of 1986 has not 
ended but the fao said the situation remains calm with only 
niger and mali reporting infestations in the past 10 days 
fao experts attributed the improvement to control measures a 
dry winter that hampered breeding and the deaths of many locusts 
over the atlantic ocean 
a locust swarm can cover more than one square mile with 50 
million insects capable of devastating 100 tons of vegetation a 
day 
in january heavy crop damage was reported in sudan ethiopia 
and chad worsening already critical food shortages 
in its latest report the fao said that only localized and 
generally low density infestations remain in mauritania senegal 
tunisia egypt yemen and kuwait

president bush expressed frustration thursday 
over inability to end violence in warravaged lebanon but said he 
and other world leaders cant give up on it 
discussing the violence during a questionandanswer session 
with a group of reporters bush said i wish there was a 
shortterm answer to stop the killing in lebanon 
he said he discussed the problem by telephone earlier this week 
with french president francois mitterrand but knew of no dramatic 
plan in which the players in the area could agree to 
and bush said the united states has little power to bring about 
change 
thats the problem we dont have great influence in lebanon 
with the factions that are fighting the president said 
the problem the shortrun of it how you stop this firing 
the shelling how you get factions to stop warring has certainly 
in recent times defied solution he said but we cant give up 
on it we simply are not going to 
the state department meanwhile said it welcomed a call by 23 
christian members of the lebanese parliament urging a ceasefire 
between the syrian army and lebanese armed forces 
we strongly support their appeal for a political dialogue 
said richard boucher a department spokesman it is a recognition 
that lebanons current crisis can only be resolved through 
consultation and reconciliation 
boucher said the statement by the lebanese parliamentarians 
reflected the desires of the vast majority of both christian 
and moslem lebanese to seek a peaceful resolution to lebanons 
political problems 
it underscores the critical importance of lebanons parliament 
as a legitimate representative body and the crucial role it must 
play in restoring a central government to the country boucher 
said 
we urge all sides including syria and general michel auoun 
to accept this call for a ceasefire and seek ways to resume a 
political dialogue he added 
the battles started march 8 after aoun the army commander and 
head of the christian cabinet in lebanons divided government 
imposed a naval blockade on ports run by independent militias 
moslem militias then shelled christian neigbhorhoods syria 
which has 40000 troops in lebanon joined the moslems 
weve been in touch with everybody we can find in lebanon and 
in the region to talk about this and to try to bring about a 
solution boucher said 
secretary of state james a baker iii testifying earlier in the 
week before the senate foreign relations committee called lebanon 
a great tragedy that is very very intractable it does not lend 
itself to an easy solution 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs 
discussion with mitterrand touched on ways the united nations might 
act to calm the situation 
both presidents stressed their concern about the loss of life 
injuries and deterioration of the situation in beirut fitzwater 
said 
mitterrand who is scheduled to visit bush at the us 
presidents vacation home at kennebunkport maine next month also 
has contacted british prime minister margaret thatcher and several 
other world leaders soliciting their help in ending the war 
during his talk with reporters along the colonnade leading to 
the oval office bush did say he felt that us standing with 
moderate arab nations had improved saying relations were as 
good today as any time in recent history 
he said he felt the united states had restored some prestige 
by the way we acted in policing the persian gulf waterway during 
the latter stages of the iraniraq war 
we have i think much better communication now with jordan 
he said bush also said that weve kept good cooperation and 
coordination with the egyptians the israelis themselves attest to 
the fact that they have great confidence in our administration 
we have some differences with all three of those bush added

canada on thursday accused four communist 
countries of gross violations of a new eastwest accord on press 
freedom and said their propaganda techniques and statecontrolled 
media resemble those of nazi germany 
canadian ambassador william bauer addressing a 35nation 
conference monitoring compliance with the accord said some of the 
signatory states remained locked in a dark age of information 
where the only correct facts are those put out by the ruling 
party 
it is particularly poignant to observe that today on the 
100th anniversary of the birth of hitler the techniques of press 
and information control which characterized his regime are still 
being applied by some european governments he added 
bauer head of the canadian delegation said later he was 
referring to romania east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia he 
described romania as a sort of joke as a signatory to an accord 
of press freedom and free speech

deplorable attempts at flagrant interference in the internal 
affairs other countries 
romania was the most reluctant signatory to the january accord

35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
bauers criticisms came on the third day of a monthlong london 
conference known as the information forum 
on wednesday the chief us delegate leonard marks also 
singled out romania bulgaria east germany and czechoslovakia as 
having done nothing to implement the accord 
in romania journalists and other users of typewriters have to 
get their machines licensed and give police a record of the 
typefaces it is the country most frequently accused of ignoring 
the january agreement 
western delegates have repeatedly praised the soviet union for 
its policy of glasnost or greater openness they also have said 
two other reformist communist states hungary and poland have made 
significant improvements in allowing free speech but still have a 
way to go 
hungary has announced widespread political reforms including 
plans to allow multiparty elections in poland the government this 
month signed a political accord with the free trade union 
solidarity 
addressing the conference thursday laszlo demus the chief 
hungarian delegate called for an end to uncritical 
selfadulation and idolization of leaders in statecontrolled 
media in europe 
if anything is redolent of the middles ages and alien to our 
presentday europeanism it is this said demus

two environmental groups said thursday they 
would sue the energy department to force a government study of the 
environmental risks posed by the planned startup of a new plutonium 
processing plant in california 
the department said it has not yet decided whether such a study 
is necessary 
the natural resources defense council and the western states 
legal foundation in a letter to energy secretary james d watkins 
said they would sue the department if it failed to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for the engineering demonstration 
system before putting the plant into operation 
the groups said the plant could begin running as early as this 
summer although janie shaheen a department spokeswoman said no 
decision had been made on the timing of startup 
in the letter to watkins the groups said an environmental 
impact statement is required by the national environmental policy 
act ms shaheen said the departments field office in san 
francisco was considering the matter and will shortly be making 
that decision 
the environmental groups said the proposed new plant at the 
departments lawrence livermore national laboratory is intended to 
demonstrate a new plutonium processing technology for use at the 
departments proposed special isotope separation plant in idaho 
which would convert fuelgrade plutonium to weapongrade plutonium 
the groups said that because of the larger population in the 
vicinity of the livermore site the engineering demonstration 
system presents more potential health and safety risk than the 
idaho site near idaho falls for which an environmental impact 
statement was prepared 
it is reckless to think an environmental impact statement is 
not needed for a facility which vaporizes sizeable quantities of 
plutonium a potent cancercausing substance in a highly 
populated area subject to earthquakes said jim werner project 
engineer at the natural resources defense council 
werners group has a suit pending against the energy department 
to force it to complete an environmental impact statement on the 
proposed restart of three defense nuclear reactors in south 
carolina the department has begun the environmental assessment 
there but contends it is not required to complete it before 
restarting the reactors which make a radioactive gas used in 
nuclear warheads

an amateur historian has withdrawn his bid to 
make al capones home a historic landmark a move hailed thursday 
by an italianamerican leader who said this is not the kind of 
image we want to be presenting to the world 
capones modest twostory brick house on chicagos south side 
was nominated for listing on the national register of historic 
places in january rejected by local groups the nomination was 
appealed by mark levell a computer repairman 
he withdrew his appeal wednesday saying i still think the 
house has tremendous historical interest but i have no intention 
of offending anyone and some people left me no doubt that they 
quite clearly are offended by it 
levell who is halfitalian has made an extensive study of 
prohibitionera crime history 
other italianamericans failed to share levells interest in the 
house said robert allegrini executive director of the 
italianamerican committee 
no one man has done so much harm to the good name of his 
ethnic group as al capone has done for italianamericans this is 
not the kind of image we want to be presenting to the world said 
allegrini 
the proposal had been opposed by italianamerican groups the 
chicago suntimes and a local neighborhood council the chicago 
landmarks commission illinois historic sites council and a city 
report had also recommended against the houses memorialization 
critics complained that i was trying to honor a notorious 
criminal but i never said anything about honor levell said 
the prohibition gangsters were part of this citys history 
they were colorful men but i never suggested them as role models 
for anyone 
levell said capone lived in the house from 1920 to 1928 but 
later moved into the lexington hotel for security he said capones 
mother and several of his brothers remained in the house after 
capone moved out 
capone who was sent to alcatraz on federal tax violations died 
of syphilis in 1947

the agriculture department inched closer 
thursday to new federal regulations on making oldfashioned country 
hams in a rulemaking process that began more than six years ago 
the country ham issue began in march 1983 when the department 
initially proposed new safety rules for commercial processors but 
industry challenges usda tinkering and other hurdles kept pushing 
back the rulemaking deadline which is currently dec 31 1989 
country hams are most commonly found in cloth bags in 
supermarkets and country stores preserved from spoilage by salt 
smoke and air for months and even years they must be scraped 
soaked and cooked before being eaten 
most hams in supermarket meat counters are wetcured quickly in 
brine solutions and cooked before sale to consumers 
in its latest move the usda proposes to allow certain amounts 
of potassium chloride as an alternative to salt in the curing of 
country hams to kill trichinae microscopic parasitic worms if 
improperly cooked and eaten infested meat can cause a disease 
called trichinosis in humans 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said federal regulations currently 
allow three curing methods for destroying trichinae in ham the 
proposal modifies two of the methods and provides an additional 
method 
crawford said the proposed new method would allow processors to 
substitute potassium chloride for some of the sodium chloride 
salt in the curing mixture 
current rules call for a 4 percent salt content to ensure safety 
of the ham but research by north carolina state university 
indicates that some substitution of potassium chloride can be 
allowed without compromising safety he said a minimum salt 
content in the cure mixture would be required but up to half the 
weight could consist of potassium chloride 
the proposal also would eliminate the current method no 2 
for destroying trichinae which involves injecting a salt water 
solution into the ham crawford said his agency believes this 
method is no longer being used commercially 
public comments on the country ham proposal can be sent through 
june 19 to policy office attn linda carey fsis hearing clerk 
room 3171s fsis usda washington dc 20250

while seeking us military aid cambodias 
noncommunist resistance still prefers a peaceful political 
solution to the southeast asian countrys problems resistance 
leader son sann said thursday 
president bushs administration is considering providing some 
weapons assistance and the proposal has backing in congress son 
sann said after meeting with administration officials 
hopefully he said the weapons would never be used but they are 
needed to press the communist side to negotiate an acceptable 
agreement and to send a signal to the khmer rouge and vietnamese 
that we can become stronger 
the war and occupationravaged country has had enough bloodshed 
and we dont want a settlement leaving any cambodian party back 
in the jungles for more fighting said the 77yearold former 
premier 
the state department said earlier this week that increased us 
help should be provided the noncommunist resistance but no 
decision has been reached on composition of the aid 
son sann said he is taking to southeast asia a new suggestion 
for the un secretary general and his representatives to take a 
dominant role in organizing and supervising free elections for a 
future cambodian government 
son sann leads the smallest of four cambodian factions involved 
in complex negotiations involving the superpowers and other 
permament members of the un security council the association of 
southeast asian nations and vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 
and which has promised to withdraw all its forces in the coming 
months 
the other cambodian factions are led by prince norodom sihanouk 
former head of state premier hun sen of the vietnameseinstalled 
peoples republic of kampuchea regime in pnomh penh and the khmer 
rouge blamed for the deaths of more than 2 million cambodians 
during a 197578 reign of terror 
son sann is heading for london and paris before returning to 
bangkok in bangkok he plans to brief sihanouk in preparation for 
what he described as a crucial may 2 meeting in jakarta indonesia 
between sihanouk and hun sen 
it will be very bad if the two sides remain deadlocked he 
said urging that hun sen consider sihanouks proposals without 
continuing to insist that his government conduct the proposed 
elections 
son sann said he is taking to sihanouk a suggestion of rep 
stephen solarz dny chairman of the house foreign affairs asian 
subcommittee for un secretary general xavier perez de cuellar to 
organize an interim government for cambodia with a special un 
representative in charge of verifying a ceasefire and organizing 
and supervising elections 
hun sen has earlier rejected a proposal for a cambodian 
government of all four factions to conduct the elections 
a prkvietnamese proposal for the 35yearold indochina control 
commission of india poland and canada to supervise the elections 
is unacceptable to the noncommunists because india one of the few 
countries to recognize the hun sen government is not neutral 
son sann said 
a successful sihanoukhun sen meeting would be followed by a 
midmay working session in paris of envoys of all four factions 
and a june summit of the faction leaders son sann said 
final stage of the settlement process he added would be an 
international conference on cambodia at which the accords should be 
guaranteed by the united states france britain china and the 
soviet union 
vietnam has announced 50000 of its soldiers remain to be 
withdrawn from cambodia son sann estimated the number of 
vietnamese remaining as 7000080000 military personnel plus 
hundreds of thousands of settlers many disguised as cambodians 
the khmer rouge he said have 35000 fighters and sihanouks 
forces number 18000 son sann said his own faction counts 10000 
activists plus unorganized latent support from most of the nation

about 1500 students braved a daylong downpour 
and marched for democracy in the capital thursday and authorities 
threatened harsh measures to crush four days of dissent 
about 1000 students marched in the central chinese city of 
nanjing and students in tianjin a port city east of beijing 
plastered posters on walls other marches were also reported in 
shanghai wuhan and hefei but details were sketchy 
nationally televised news led with a stern warning that the 
protests the biggest since the prodemocracy demonstrations of 
198687 would no longer be tolerated 
these activities have gone beyond the limits of the law and 
the taking of harsh measures to end the disturbances has become 
necessary the announcer said quoting from an editorial by the 
official xinhua news agency 
these protesters do not really care about the future or 
happiness of china all they want to do is overthrow the communist 
party and the government the editorial said 
the protests were prompted by the death saturday of hu yaobang 
an outspoken reformer who was ousted as communist party chief in 
1987 hu was accused of encouraging liberal ideas and failing to 
crack down on the 198687 student demonstrators 
the beijing city government issued regulations that restricted 
commemoration activities for hu to inside universities businesses 
and factories 
the regulations also said rioters and other lawbreakers would 
be dealt with severely according to the law 
early thursday thousands of security forces rushed into crowds 
of students as they protested near the headquarters of the ruling 
communist party 
student organizers said security forces beat more than 200 
students injuring about 40 between 40 and 50 were arrested they 
said 
there was no official report on the arrests or injuries but 
associated press reporters witnessed several beatings and 
detainments 
thursday afternoon students from several universities marched 
for hours under heavy rain to tiananmen square the symbolic center 
of chinese political life 
in the evening they rallied around the huge obelisk 
commemorating chinas revolutionary heroes now draped with 
eulogies and portraits of hu 
the blood of our classmates will not be shed in vain said 
one student leader since the time of the first emperor 2000 
years ago china has been living under a dictatorship it is time 
for this to end 
students huddled closely under tattered umbrellas as the wind 
and rain howled about them 
student speakers said they were demanding that officially 
controlled student unions at their schools be disbanded and 
replaced with democratic organizations 
the student demands formulated monday include free speech a 
free press more money for education and disclosure by officials of 
their incomes and bank accounts 
we dont oppose specific people we oppose dictatorship one 
speaker said thursday evening but some students have singled out 
senior leader deng xiaoping who has failed to satisfy 
intellectuals demands for political reform 
turnout was much lower than for previous days activities which 
peaked when about 6000 students rallied before about 20000 
onlookers then marched on party headquarters late wednesday and 
early thursday 
by 930 pm the protesters drenched with rain and chilled by 
a cool breeze began to march back to their universities 
as the protesters returned home hundreds of police officers 
came out of hiding and poured into buses and trucks that left the 
square some security forces were armed with rifles the first time 
arms have been openly displayed during the protests 
in nanjing about 1000 students set out thursday night from 
nanjing university toward the jiangsu provincial government 
offices said an american teacher at the school on condition of 
anonymity 
it was not clear whether they reached the offices the teacher 
said a similar number of students marched wednesday night for about 
four hours carrying banners and chanting down with 
dictatorship 
a chinese student from nankai university in tianjin said the 
walls of his schools were plastered with posters and poems calling 
for democracy

highly concentrated tear gas could have caused the 
symptoms that prompted some officials to charge that soldiers used 
nerve gas in a violent clash with protesters in soviet georgia a 
foreign ministry spokesman said thursday 
it would be unwarranted if we were to talk about nerve gas 
spokesman yuri gremitskykh said at a news briefing despite reports 
in the government newspaper izvestia that protesters had been 
injured by an aerosol with an effect like atropine a nerve poison 
at least 20 demonstrators died april 9 when soldiers were 
ordered to clear a crowd of proindependence demonstrators 
witnesses say the troops attacked with shovels clubs and gas and 
chased down fleeing demonstrators to beat them to death georgian 
activists claim several deaths were caused by the gas 
gremitskykh cited media reports that tear gas had been used 
against the demonstrators and he told reporters that highly 
concentrated tear gas could have caused the injuries that georgian 
health minister irakly menagarishvili blamed on a substance like 
atropine 
atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses 
can induce nerve paralysis and delirium it can cause death through 
combined cardiac and respiratory failure 
gremitskykh said the cause of death must be established by 
medical experts there has been no official account of the number 
of protesters poisoned by the gas 
meanwhile another group of moscow intellectuals joined the 
condemnation of the decision to send troops to clear peaceful 
demonstrators 
april a group of progressive writers adopted a resolution

a boston university proposal to raise money by 
taking out life insurance policies on students drew mixed reviews 
thursday with some terming it a ghoulish scheme and others 
applauding its moneymaking potential 
bu president john silber has proposed taking out policies on 
students and alumni and collecting the benefits when they die 
its very much in the discussion kind of stage numbers and 
fine points are to be worked out if ever said tom cashman vice 
president of public affairs 
some students were aghast at the idea of the school benefiting 
from their deaths even though the program would be voluntary 
i have a feeling he hasnt thought this through its going to 
make it a dracula kind of school said drew kodjak a graduate 
student at bus law school 
i have to give him credit its a great idea said steven 
cagnetta also a law student it just doesnt sit right 
silber discussed the proposal publicly last week before a group 
of scholarship students the university newspaper the daily free 
press later published an account of his remarks silber was not in 
his office thursday 
cashman said he has received some positive calls from donors 
interested in the proposal 
its not as negative as some of our reviewers want to cast 
it he said its an opportunity for individuals who are 
concerned about the longterm financial health of the university 50 
60 or 70 years down the line to make a contribution that far 
exceeds what they otherwise would be able to do 
money to buy the policies probably would come from a 
fundraising drive and students would neither pay nor receive money 
for participating 
the plan calls for purchasing 1000 policies worth 350000 at a 
cost of 5500 each with bu listed as policy owner the school 
would then wait 10 years before buying more eventually the 
original 1000 policies would be worth 350 million several times 
the original outlay 
insurance officials said the idea seemed to be a new development 
in the traditional method of deferred giving other universities 
have suggested their alumni make their alma mater part of their 
estate plans including naming schools as beneficiaries of life 
insurance policies 
at st louis university in missouri a plan under which an 
alumnus makes a gift and then allows the school to take out a life 
insurance policy under his name has created a future endowment of 
16 million said the rev j barry mcgannon vice president for 
development 
but he said the bu program appears to be of far greater scope 
than other plans 
silber has said he wants to raise 1 billion by the year 2000 
its a gimmick of course its a twist on what weve heard 
of said ben isaacs spokesman for the american council of life 
insurance in new york some corporations already are starting to 
ensure their employees but isaacs said he hasnt heard of colleges 
doing so we think this may be a developing thing 
i think it sounds inventive and interesting said paul 
miller vice president of the council for aid to education in 
washington id like to know more about it

afghan guerrillas fired a rocket into 
the soviet embassy on thursday shattering windows of an 
administration building but causing no casualties soviet officials 
said 
soviet diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
did not believe the attack was deliberate 
they said the rocket was fired from about 20 miles northwest of 
the capital 
the soviet news agency tass reported in moscow it was only by 
mere luck that no resident of the soviet embassy compound was 
hurt 
the united states closed its embassy in kabul before soviet 
troops completed their withdrawal feb 15 since then moslem 
insurgents have attacked kabul intermittently but have concentrated 
their attack on the eastern city of jalalabad 
afghan foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said 
wednesday that government forces killed 148 insurgents and wounded 
67 in fighting around jalalabad and killed 50 more in kandahar 
herat paktia laghman and faryab provinces 
guerrilla spokesmen claimed their fighters ambushed a military 
convoy north of kabul and killed 50 government servicemen 
neither side said when the fighting occurred but government 
reports usually concern the previous 24 hours each side 
consistently exaggerates the others losses and their claims 
cannot be verified 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad pakistan reported thursday 
that rebel rocket attacks on jalalabad killed two people the 
guerrillas were reportedly blasting the city from key positions to 
the south and east said radio kabul the radio also said four 
people were hurt thursday when rockets blasted kabul 
jalalabads fall would be considered a coup for the rebels who 
have not yet managed to take any of afghanistans key cities 
in islamabad the president of the guerrillas new 
governmentinexile on thursday offered afghanistans marxist 
president najib protection if he resigns and hands power over to 
an interim guerrilla government 
sibghatullah mojaddidi said we will give him protection if 
they ruling marxists transfer power to our government then we 
will give them protection and amnesty 
he did not say if najib would qualify for amnesty he only 
offered him protection 
mojaddidi was responding to najibs offer wednesday to resign if 
it would end the decadelong war 
yahya nauroz the provisional governments military chief of 
staff said in islamabad that the governmentinexile will begin 
receiving arms directly from its supporters rather than through 
pakistan among nations supporting the guerrillas are the united 
states china and saudi arabia 
the mujahedeen holy warriors will directly receive the next 
consignment of arms possibly within two weeks he said but he 
would not name the suppliers 
the united states is a leading arms supplier to the guerrillas 
who began fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
soviet soldiers entered the war in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in afghanistan when the withdrawal began in 
may 1988

gen manuel noriegas new plan to require 
visas for us citizens visiting panama is an attempt to avoid 
international scrutiny during next months elections the state 
department charged on thursday 
noriegas latest action is an effort to insulate panamas 
electoral process from any credible degree of public scrutiny 
said department spokesman richard boucher 
the noriega regime has announced that as of april 21 americans 
may no longer travel to panama by simply filling out a tourist 
card the card was given to tourists at the airport of their point 
of departure 
the opposition which has expressed fears the polling will be 
rigged by the government has invited hundreds of foreigners to 
visit panama for the national may 7 election 
the key race involves a noreigabacked candidate for president 
against an opposition leader 
boucher added that noriegas officials have also begun to screen 
visa applications in third countries in an effort to deny travel 
to panama of election observers journalists and other persons 
interested in covering the panama electoral process 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drug smuggling 
charges the united states has maintained that it cannot have 
normal relations with the panamanian government until noriega steps 
down 
the spokesman contrasted the new visa restriction with the 
recent salvadoran election and the upcoming paraguay election where 
election observers press and diplomatic scrutiny have been 
actively and openly welcomed 
the spokesman said the election would provides an opportunity 
for panamanians to move forward to a resolution of the continuing 
political and economic crisis a fraudulent election will only 
perpetuate panamas problems 
a legitimate regime has nothing to fear from an honest 
election and from the unfettered presence of observers and of the 
press boucher said 
the requirement could create headaches for us citizens who 
want to visit panama because most panamanian consulates in the 
united states are not recognized by noriegas regime the rule 
states that us citizens must have visas stamped by panamanian 
consulates recognized by our government 
only the consulate in tampa fla is said to be recognized by 
noriegas followers 
the majority of diplomatic offices in the united states have 
remained loyal to the ousted president eric arturo delvalle who 
has moved to miami 
in february 1988 delvalle attempted to fire noriega from his 
post as defense chief but within hours he was deposed by the 
legislature dominated by noriega followers

preliminary tests suggest unhealthy levels of 
radon in schools across the country the environmental protection 
agency said thursday in urging every school to test for the 
odorless cancercausing gas 
based on measurements taken in 3000 schoolrooms in 16 states 
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in 
schools throughout the united states epa administrator william 
k reilly told a luncheon at the national press club 
the epa said that 54 percent of 130 public schools tested in 41 
communities had at least one room in which radon levels were found 
to exceed 4 picocuries per liter of air indicating a need for 
additional tests and likely corrective action 
in 101 rooms tested at schools in five states levels of at 
least 20 picocuries per liter were found comparable to what would 
be found in uranium mines 
epa spokeswoman martha casey said no list of the schools tested 
was immediately available but affected state authorities and 
school officials have been told of the test results 
reilly called indoor radon the result of natural radioactive 
decay in the ground one of the major environmental health 
threats facing americans and urged that school officials 
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas 
he said it is important that school administrators nationwide 
understand both the seriousness of the risk and the relative 
simplicity of testing and fixing the problem 
there is no federal law requiring tests for the radioactive gas 
although the epa by law is required to conduct sample tests 
nationwide in homes and schools to determine potential health 
threats the preliminary findings from the 16 states came from 
twoday tests in rooms normally occupied by students teachers and 
school staff ms casey said 
last september the epa urged all homeowners to conduct radon 
tests after unhealthy levels 4 picocuries per liter of air of 
radon were found in one out of four homes tested in 17 states 
the agency has said that exposure over a lifetime at that level 
is equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes a day the epa said studies 
have indicated indoor exposure to radon may cause up to 20000 lung 
cancer deaths a year which would make such deaths second only to 
those caused by smoking 
the latest epa tests although preliminary indicate that 
unhealthy radon levels in schools are at least as widespread as in 
residences although the agency emphasized that the levels may 
range widely from school to school and even among rooms in the same 
school 
guimond estimated in an interview that from the data obtained in 
the limited number of tests it is estimated that students in 
probably 10 percent of the nations schools are exposed to 
longterm radon levels that exceed the 4 picocuries standard 
the epa said that of the 3000 schoolrooms tested 19 percent 
had levels of 4 picocuries or more and 3 percent had levels of at 
least 20 picocuries 
the agency gave this breakdown of states with schoolrooms having 
radon levels of at least 20 picocuries tennessee 77 rooms 
washington 14 new mexico 7 maine 2 and montana 1 
the highest level was found in a schoolroom in tennessee in 
which 136 picocuries per liter of air were detected schools with 
unusually high levels ranging from 25 to 98 picocuries per liter 
of air in a single schoolroom were washington 98 picocuries 
montana 51 new mexico 41 and maine 25 
richard guimond the epas director of radiation programs said 
such levels are not that unique at schools located in areas 
where significant radon is present in the ground and where 
ventilation systems often suck radon into buildings when these 
two things occur youre going to get those high levels he said 
federal standards call for uranium miners to wear special 
breathing equipment when working long periods in radon levels of 16 
to 20 picocuries said guimond 
the other states in which schools were tested were were nevada 
wyoming colorado north dakota kansas minnesota missouri 
illinois indiana georgia and new jersey 
the agency said exposure levels are difficult to determine from 
the test data because students in many schools move from room to 
room during the day and because radon levels may vary widely among 
the rooms in a school 
according to the agency unhealthy radon levels also have been 
found in epa tests in schools in virginia florida maryland 
pennsylvania new york ohio and iowa those findings were not 
part of the latest study and no additional information was 
available 
radon is a naturally produced gas that is colorless odorless 
and tasteless it is the product of the natural radioactive decay 
of radium226 in the soil and rocks while levels normally found 
outdoors 02 to 07 picocurie per liter post no known dangers 
accumulated concentrations can be much higher indoors 
scientists have said that the health risks of radon depend not 
only on the concentration of radon at a given time but also on the 
length of exposure estimated health risks normally are based on 
exposure over a lifetime 
the epa estimates that as many as 15 percent of lung cancer 
deaths annually may be related to radon exposure while smoking 
remains clearly the major cause of lung cancer a combination of 
heavy smoking and lifelong exposure to high levels of radon sharply 
increases the chances of lung cancer according to studies by the 
national acacemy of sciences 
the epa said radon tests were conducted in public schools in 
these communities

the state department and the nicaraguan 
contras criticized on thursday a new law approved by the 
sandinistadominated legislature contending that it will favor 
progovernment candidates in next februarys elections 
although the text of the legislation has not been made public 
opposition leaders in nicaragua said the law approved tuesday 
night allows government representatives to dominate the 
allpowerful supreme electoral council 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the 
council in order to achieve legitimacy has to fairly represent 
the people of nicaragua 
the structure thats been passed in this legislation is not 
one that can lead to further steps that would ensure the 
legitimacy of the elections he said 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros used stronger language in 
criticizing the legislation 
we endorse position of the internal opposition that this 
will only serve to create a fraud we cannot be an accomplice to 
such a process matamoros said 
he said the sandinistas want to rule by force and not by 
consent 
a bipartisan task force of eight us election law experts who 
spent four days in managua earlier this month also criticized the 
legislation thursday 
citing information provided by credible diplomatic and 
opposition sources the eight said in a statement issued at a news 
conference we believe the new law will not provide an adequate 
foundation for a free and fair election in nicaragua 
the group made up of five democrats and three republicans 
visited nicaragua under the sponsorship of freedom house a private 
organization which promotes democracy worldwide 
the legislation also has been denounced by costa rican foreign 
minister rodrigo madrigal nieto who called the election law a 
bad start that was far from reaching the goals for fulfilling 
all that was promised by the sandinistas during a central 
american summit meeting in february 
at that meeting the sandinista government promised to hold free 
elections next february in exchange for the closing of contra bases 
in honduras central american leaders are attempting to draw up a 
plan that will lead to the demobilization of the rebels 
the bush administration has declined to seek additional military 
aid for the rebels and instead is focussing its energies on using 
diplomatic political and economic pressures on the sandinistas in 
hopes of encouraging a democratic outcome 
discussing the conflicts over the election law boucher said 
we believe the best way to resolve these differences is for the 
government to sit down with the internal opposition and negotiate 
both sides will need to seek common ground and must be willing 
to compromise if trust and legitimacy is to be created in this 
first crucial step in the process

shellshocked residents emerged cautiously 
from bunkers thursday during an uncertain lull to face shortages of 
water bread and electricity after 42 days of bombardments by rival 
christian and moslem forces 
the guns and rocket launchers which by police count have fired 
more than 100000 projectiles since march 8 were mostly silent 
occasional salvos kept people on edge 
well be lucky if this lull persists and we manage to get some 
sleep said grocer youssef aridi as he closed his store in moslem 
west beirut after opening it briefly to sell what few goods he had 
left 
the latest spasm of shelling which began at dusk saturday 
inexplicably slackened late wednesday 
the quiet followed a ceasefire call tuesday from 23 christian 
parliament deputies but gen michel aoun whose mainly christian 
army forces have been battling an alliance of syrian troops and 
moslem druse militiamen rejected that call 
the leftist assafir daily termed the lull a halftruce the 
christian lebanese broadcasting corp called it an ambigious 
ceasefire 
whatever the reason for it the break gave people a chance to 
get out of the shelters in which theyve been cooped up check 
their homes and businesses for damage and buy what food and 
supplies were available 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said it was a doubleedged sword 
its good to give the people a breather so they can get some 
sleep but its risky as well because people might get used to it 
and forget the dangers of renewed shelling thats when you get 
heavy casualties he said 
about 200 university students demonstrated outside the us 
embassy in the christian suburb of aukar chanting antisyrian 
slogans 
the proaoun protesters brandished placards calling on the bush 
administration to help drive the syrian army out of lebanon 
bush told reporters in washington thursday that he and other 
world leaders cant give up trying to end the violence in 
lebanon 
but he said the united states does not have great influence in 
lebanon with the factions that are fighting 
by police count at least 270 people have been killed and nearly 
1000 wounded since march 8 
among them was spanish ambassador pedro manuel de arestigui 
killed when a shell hit his house in east beirut on sunday his 
body was flown thursday to madrid 
the shelling duels some of the heaviest in lebanons 
14yearold civil war erupted after aoun blockaded moslem 
militiarun ports 
aoun who heads the christian cabinet vying for power with a 
rival moslem government was seeking to restore state authority 
long eroded by powerful militias 
the druse progressive socialist party which operates two 
illegal ports south of beirut retaliated by shelling the 
christianheld beirut port syrian allies who maintain 40000 
troops in lebanon joined and blockaded the christians 
310squaremile coastal enclave 
more than 150000 people have fled beirut during earlier lulls 
and more driven as much by shortages as the fear of renewed 
bombardment packed up what they could thursday and got out 
moslem refugees have moved south for sanctuary but the 
christians have no place to hide in their enclave every inch of it 
within range of longrange syrian artillery 
the christians only exit is through the frequently shelled port 
of jounieh where ferries leave for cyprus 
even that escape route was in jeopardy the two cypriot 
companies that run the ferries suspended service after the vessels 
came under moslem rocket fire 
for those who stay behind life has become a nightmare 
police and army explosives experts defused 300 unexploded shells 
found in moslem west beirut on thursday 
its not known how many more lie beneath the rubble of apartment 
blocks factories schools hospitals and stores 
both sides are suffering severe shortages fruit and vegetables 
for the christians who normally get their supplies from moslem 
areas bread for the moslems because flour warehouses are in 
christian territory 
both sides lack fuel because the main depot at dora in east 
beirut was blown up by syrian shellfire the main power stations 
shut down saturday when fuel ran out for their generators 
that knocked out the water pumping system leaving homes dry and 
fire crews unable to tackle burning buildings and cars set ablaze 
in the shelling many people dont have water to wash off after 
weeks in their shelters 
the rubblestrewn streets are littered with stinking 
ratinfested piles of garbage municipal officials said the fuel 
shortage meant garbage trucks couldnt run and anyway they said 
most of the 2000 street cleaners have fled 
the moslemrun voice of the nation reported that the french navy 
tanker penhors sent by paris with a hospital ship on a 
humanitarian mission would unload its desperately needed cargo of 
fuel oil within 24 hours 
the radio said one third would be unloaded at the moslemrun 
power station at jiye south of beirut and the rest at the zouk 
plant in christian territory north of the capital 
with moslems and christian leaders bickering over who should get 
the most fuel most beirutis wont believe the radio report until 
their lights come on again

farmland prices have gained another 6 percent 
but are still far below the 1982 peak before they began their 
fiveyear skid the agriculture department said thursday 
the departments economic research service said that as of feb 
1 the average value of us farmland including buildings was 597 
per acre up from about 564 on feb 1 1988 
farmland prices sank to a 19year low of 548 per acre on feb 
1 1987 before gaining 3 percent last year 
however the 1989 value was still 27 percent below the record 
823 in 1982 the report said 
several factors were cited for the gain in farmland prices net 
cash income of farmers in 1988 nearly matched the 1987 record and 
that buoyed confidence among prospective buyers that the 
agricultural sector was working its way out of the crunch that 
weighed on many farmers 
although producers hit by the 1988 drought experienced lower 
crop yields many grain producers particularly those with 
irrigation and those holding grain stocks from previous harvests 
benefited from sharply higher market prices the report said 
federal drought aid also boosted farm receipts in 1988 an help 
blunt the shortterm impact higher cattle prices helped expand 
cash receipts from livestock to record levels last year the 
report said 
values rose in all farm production regions except the southern 
plains the report said substantial gains in pennsylvania 
delaware and new jersey led the 13 percent average increase in 
the northeast 
although state average farmland prices were not immediately 
available the report said substantial gains also occurred in the 
corn belt up 10 percent and the northern plains 9 percent 
further significantly higher values were reported in iowa and 
nebraska 
land value increases in the lake states up 5 percent and the 
southeast up 7 percent were said to be comparable to last 
year while a 6 percent increase in appalachia was sharply higher 
than the year before a 3 percent in the value of farmland in the 
delta states was the first since 1981

the coast guard boarding of a taiwanese ship 
suspected of illegal driftnetting illustrates us concerns over a 
fishing technique that can wipe out huge numbers of sea creatures 
a top state department official said thursday 
this is a very serious matter and it would be an 
understatement to say this heightens the issue said ed wolfe 
the state departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries the 
us position is there should be no driftnet fishing at all it is 
wasteful and inefficient 
an estimated 700 fishing boats from taiwan south korea and 
japan have been using driftnets in the northern pacific ocean to 
catch squid since the early 1980s the nets are up to 35 miles long 
and can cover more than 30000 square miles of ocean 
us fishermen charge the nets snare north american salmon and 
the illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in alaska 
washington state and oregon 
as the episode in the north pacific ocean hundreds of miles 
southwest of the aleutian islands unfolded over the past week 
secretary of state james baker iii and deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger were involved in an effort to convince the 
taiwanese government to allow crewmen from the cutter jarvis to 
board the cyi yang no 1 
the coast guard was also exploring less diplomatic ways of 
halting the vessel which was believed fleeing toward taiwan after 
abandoning its driftnets those methods involve spraying water 
down its smokestack entangling its propellors or as a last 
resort firing warning shots 
late wednesday the taiwanese government decided to allow the 
boarding which took place without incident but a representative 
of the taiwanese government made clear the granting of permission 
to board would not be considered a precedent 
the jarvis was escorting the taiwanese ship back to the area 
where the incident began and us aircraft were searching for the 
abandoned driftnets the coast guard is looking for any evidence 
that the nets from the cyi yang no 1 had caught salmon 
northwest lawmakers have accused the driftnet fleets of 
stealing an estimated 10000 metric tons of salmon worth an 
estimated 21 million annually 
the illegally caught fish are then laundered through fish 
processors in southeast asia where they are canned or frozen and 
sold on international markets in direct competition with us fish 
products the lawmakers have said 
environmentalists also claim the nets are responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of porpoises seals seabirds and other marine 
life 
driftnet fishing has been limited to areas well away from the 
migration routes of salmon 
the cyi yang no 1 was first spotted 450 miles outside the legal 
fishing zone and in waters where the taiwanese government itself 
has banned driftnetting 
the first contact between the two vessels came early sunday when 
the cyi yang no 1 warned the jarvis about five miles away that 
it had driftnets in the water 
when the jarvis identified itself as a us vessel the 
taiwanese ship cut its nets and fled the jarvis then began 
shadowing the cyi yang no 1 at times only several hundred feet 
away as the diplomatic negotiations began in washington 
the boarding took place almost 700 miles away from where the 
incident began 
since congress enacted a law in late 1987 the state department 
has been trying to negotiate driftnet monitoring and enforcement 
agreements with japan tawian and south korea 
if such agreements are not reached by june 29 the president can 
then impose trade restrictions on the imports of fish products from 
those countries 
last year the united states imported 502 million worth of 
edible and such noedible fisheries products as pearls from japan 
282 million from south korea and 445 million from taiwan 
talks with the japanese earlier this month broke off and wolfe 
said that while some progress has been made its not enough at 
this point 
wolfe said that the taiwanese and koreans have been essentially 
stonewalling efforts by the us to negotiate an agreement 
though wolfe is headed to korea next week and expects talks with 
the taiwanese to resume later this spring

mourners rioted thursday at the funeral of 
a boy killed during protests of government price increases and one 
man died when police opened fire residents said another report 
said a policeman also was slain 
rioters pelted police with stones and burned several buildings 
including the house of a mazar official accused by residents of 
killing the boy witnesses said 
violent demostrations were reported thursday in several other 
villages in southern jordan the latest killing raised the death 
toll to at least eight in three days of unrest 
despite the widespread protests against prime minister zaid 
ridais austerity measures there was no evidence of opposition to 
king hussein himself in the southern jordan region that is 
considered a bedrock of his strength 
several residents of this village 55 miles south of amman said 
members of jordans bedouin desert police shot and killed yacoub 
katawneh 23 during the chaotic funeral of his cousin 13yearold 
ibrahim katawneh 
we had two burials it was an awful scene people shouted and 
threw stones at police armed desert police shot live ammunition at 
people said one resident who would not give his name 
officials in the nearby city of kerak confirmed the two deaths 
the officials and several witnesses in the town said a local 
subgovernor allegedly killed the younger katawneh and injured six 
other people when he fired at a crowd of demonstrators who 
approached his house wednesday 
one knowledgeable official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said one policeman died and another was injured in the mazar 
rioting on thursday police did not confirm the report 
residents said rioters on thursday burned an army supply depot 
a bank a court building and the home of the official accused of 
wednesdays shootings 
twenty armored antiriot vehicles stood at the entrance of the 
village on the historic kings highway blocking the village to 
outsiders 
the unrest began tuesday in maan 120 miles south of the 
capital when taxi drivers demonstrated against price rises in 
gasoline and vehicle fees imposed sunday as part of an agreement 
with the international monetary fund 
the protests spread to cities and villages throughout southern 
jordan where incomes tend to be lower than those in the north 
eid shihan the kerak districts police director refused to 
describe events in the area but said they were blamed on 
specific groups that we know and we will catch the situation now

black smoke apparently from burning tires rose into the sky 
behind him 
in the adjacent village of mutah reporters saw fire damage to a 
bank and two government offices attacked on thursday 
other witnesses said rioters burned cars set up roadblocks and 
set fire to government offices and banks in a string of small 
villages north of kerak and in the town of ghor essafi south of 
the dead sea 
governmentrun media have given no details of the rioting or 
military action during the past three days referring only to 
sorrowful incidents 
they reported thursday that hussein visiting washington said 
he believed everything is under control in the country and 
also have reported meetings between officials to discuss the 
unspecified events 
the declining value of the dinar during the past year has led 
many prices to double while incomes have remained stable because 
of the devaluation per capita income has slipped to about 1200 a 
year from 2000 a few years ago

housing secretary jack kemp who has 
encouraged efforts to evict drug dealers and users from public 
housing said thursday that authorities will have to consider the 
role parents played in drug activity by their children before 
evicting entire families 
kemp said that in some cases parents may be unable to control 
older physically strong children who are engaged in drug activity 
in those cases he said i dont think mom and dad should be 
punished by eviction 
but he said there are cases where mothers or other heads of 
families are participants in drug enterprises sometimes with their 
children 
let the tenants and the phas public housing agencies throw 
them out kemp said on the first first one one time 
youre caught doing dealing engaging in drug traffic i would 
say out 
kemp secretary of housing and urban development has offered to 
drop hud requirements that public housing agencies hold hearings 
for tenants before they can be evicted for drugrelated activity 
he said the hearings may be waived if local laws provide tenants 
with due process in the courts 
kemp this week announced hud actions aimed at further easing the 
eviction process for local public housing agencies which operate 
federally subsidized housing projects among the steps hud is 
taking is to make illegal drug abuse or drug dealing a specific 
violation of leases for hudsubsidized housing 
kemp spoke at a seminar sponsored by sen tim wirth dcolo 
for colorado constituents 
asked how the eviction policy would be applied in cases of 
families with children kemp said each case would depend on the 
role of the parents 
i think on a casebycase basis youve got to find out whether 
the parents were involved and knowingly allowed drugs to be either 
sold or manufactured or dealt or used in that apartment public 
housing or whether they were overcome by a situation kemp said 
if they were overcome by the circumstances of having one of 
their children involved without them having any culpability i 
would say they shouldnt lose their apartment he said 
if a mother believe it or not is involved in drugs she 
ought to be i dont want to make her homeless but i dont want 
her polluting public housing and ive got a home for her or him or 
whoever jail he said

radio moscow on thursday solicited israeli 
investment in soviet companies saying the lack of diplomatic ties 
between the two countries was not an obstacle to trade 
the offer was made during the stations nightly 30minute 
hebrewlanguage broadcast said israel radio monitor mickey gurdus 
in the past radio moscow has used the broadcasts mainly for 
commentary sharply critical of the jewish state 
in the proposal presented thursday the radio station named a 
soviet company for foreign trade belka and provided its address 
telephone and telex numbers in moscow gurdus said 
they said they are ready to initiate the contacts and later 
represent israeli companies because its quite expensive to 
maintain offices in the soviet union gurdus said 
they said they made the offer even though there are no 
diplomatic ties and are ready to discuss any offer he said 
the soviet union severed diplomatic ties after israel captured 
lands of moscows arab allies during the 1967 middle east war 
in the past two years relations have improved mainly because 
the soviet union hopes to play a greater role in the middle east 
the two countries have swapped consular delegations and stepped up 
cultural exchanges

the sovietbacked government of ethiopia asked 
the united states to accept its ambassador in washington in an 
apparent move to upgrade relations it was reported on thursday 
the ethiopians have expressed an interest in improved 
relations a subject that has been under consideration by both 
governments for some months department spokesman richard boucher 
told reporters 
the spokesman said the united states was continuing to 
review the request but that nothing more had been decided 
at present the two countries are represented only by a charge 
daffaires in each others capitals 
an official familiar with developments in the african nation 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the request was made last 
month 
the ethiopians asked to send tibabu bekelena a diplomat who is 
now the countrys deputy foreign minister as the ambassador said 
the official 
it appeared unlikely that the united states would move quickly 
on the request 
the bid comes after more than a decade of poor relations between 
the two nations that stemmed from the 1974 revolution that removed 
emperor haile selassie and brought lieut col mengistu haile 
mariam and his leftist supporters to power 
and due to congressional unhappiness with the human rights 
situation in ethiopia economic assistance to the nation is barred 
in its most recent report on human rights the state department 
charged ethiopia with a deplorable human rights record 
humanitarian aid however is allowed and last year the us 
government provided some 110 million in food primarily to aid 
those starving due to the conflict with rebel factions in the 
northern provinces of eritrea and figure

the jury in oliver norths irancontra trial 
was dispatched thursday to decide the guilt or innocence of the 
former white house aide with the judges admonition that no one 
including the president had the legal authority to order anyone 
to violate the law 
north has said he had authority from superiors including he 
believed president reagan for many of his actions in behalf of 
the nicaraguan rebels at a time when official us aid was banned 
because of the lateness of the hour jurors were sent to the 
nearby hotel where they will be sequestered with orders to begin 
deliberations on friday 
us district judge gerhard a gesell told them your job is to 
decide the facts in the first trial stemming from the mid1980s 
affair in which profits from arms sales to iran were diverted to 
aid the nicaraguan rebels 
the judge was specific in his instruction about norths 
contention that he acted under orders from top white house 
officials and he assumed with reagans approval 
neither the president nor any of the defendants superiors had 
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law gesell 
said 
you have heard testimony indicating that other government 
officials may in some respects have concealed facts known to them 
and some ranking above or below the defendant may have engaged in 
conduct similar to that charged against the defendant on trial 
but he said the conduct of others was no justification and 
you are not to judge defendants guilt or innocence based solely 
on the actions of others 
the judges charge was delayed for a half day by a problem 
involving jurors who may have given misleading answers in pretrial 
questioning when he convened court in the afternoon gesell said 
he had denied a north motion for a mistrial filed on grounds that 
the jury had been infected by publicity about some of its 
members 
the five alternates were dismissed after gesell gave the 
instructions 
gesell said norths defense that he was authorized to cover up 
his secret contra role may be considered but under closely defined 
circumstances 
authorization requires clear direct instruction to act at a 
given time in a given way he said it must be specific not 
simply a general admonition or vague expression of preference it 
must be sufficiently precise 
the most attentive person in the courtroom as gesell read his 
long instructions appeared to be north whose eyes seldom left the 
judge occasionally the 47 yearold defendant would make a note on 
a legal pad writing with his left hand 
norths wife and mother had been in the courtroom for much of 
the mornings long wait but they did not return in the afternoon 
until the instructions had been read 
six of the charges involve withholding information from congress 
when it sought to find out about norths and the national security 
councils role in supplying aid to the contras 
conviction on each of those counts carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison each of the 12 counts has a 250000 penalty 
for a maximum of 3 million 
north also is charged with obstructing a presidential inquiry 
making false statements when he was questioned by attorney general 
edwin meese iii and conspiring to defraud the united states 
through illegal use of a taxexempt foundation each of those 
counts carries a 5year penalty 
one count of altering destroying and concealing documents is 
punishable by three years in prison another of accepting an 
illegal gratuity a 13800 security system is punishable by two 
years the remaining count converting travelers checks to his 
personal use carries a 10year maximum sentence 
if convicted of all counts north could be sentenced to a 
maximum of 60 years in prison but federal court practice is to 
limit sentences to the longest on a single count in this case 10 
years jurors also have the option of convicting north of aiding 
and abetting in a crime rather than as the principal in seven of 
the charges the penalty would be the same as for conviction of the 
full charge 
gesell had scheduled final instructions to the jury in the 
morning but instead remained in his chambers apparently 
requestioning some or all of the jurors and alternates 
abc news had reported that jurors caswell g hartridge 61 and 
helen g lynch 37 had been named as defendants in civil suits 
involving accidents in 1982 
both answered no on jury questionnaires asking whether they 
had ever been involved as a party in any court proceedings 
civil or criminal both cases were settled out of court 
abc also reported that the first alternate juror joseph l 
ward 33 who answered no to the same question had been 
arrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics 
he was placed on probation for a year the network said he also 
was arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasnt 
prosecuted it said 
in the jury room will be hundreds of pages of exhibits 
introduced in the course of the trial including a 42page 
admission by the government of actions taken in behalf of the 
contras 
the document summarizes events the government considered so 
secret that it wanted no testimony about them in open court among 
them is mention of a 1985 trip in which george bush then 
vicepresident told the president of honduras that nation would 
receive expedited military and economic aid 
that aid according to other testimony was part of an 
arrangement for honduras allowing supplies to reach the contras 
although there was no mention that bush knew of the deal 
bush said thursday that my conscience is clear about the 
irancontra affair and he promised to cooperate with congressional 
requests for unreleased reagan administration documents 
as before he refused to comment directly on his role in the 
affair 
in final arguments to the jury wednesday defense lawyer brendan 
sullivan declared that the government has not shown criminal 
behavior by north he concluded i ask you to set him free 
but prosecutor john keker said that even though north openly 
admits lying to congress and shredding evidence he has refused to 
acknowledge that he did anything wrong its time for you to do 
it for him keker told the jurors

the nuclear regulatory commission awarded 
a fullpower operating license to the controversial shoreham 
nuclear power plant thursday in a gesture that may ultimately prove 
symbolic 
the commission voted 40 to grant the license capping years of 
hearings that produced reams of testimony and cost millions of 
dollars it is the first us nuclear plant to be licensed on the 
basis of a utilityformulated emergency plan rather than one 
created by the state and local governments 
after the vote nrc chairman lando zech told reporters that the 
commission had fulfilled its duties without regard to the issue of 
whether shoreham would ever achieve full power 
asked if he thought it was a waste that the plant might never 
operate zech said as the chairman of the regulatory commission 
thats not my responsibility as an american citizen i would call 
it a waste 
richard kessel head of the state consumer protection board 
called the license virtually meaningless but joseph mcdonnell 
a long island lighting co vice president said the license is a 
prerequisite for establishing a national nuclear policy 
lilco which owns the 809megawatt reactor has agreed not to 
bring the plant up to full power pending a vote by shareholders to 
scrap the 55 billion plant 
the vote sometime before june 15 will make or break a deal 
under which lilco would sell shoreham to new york state for 1 in 
exchange for a decade of annual rate increases the state would 
then oversee the decommissioning and dismantling of the plant that 
was once touted as the solution to long islands energy shortages 
lilco was forced to draw up its own emergency evacuation plan 
after new york state suffolk county and the town of southampton on 
long island withdrew support for the plant contending that the 
zone around shoreham could not be safely evacuated in case of an 
accident given long islands large population and the dearth of 
roads leading away from the plant 
the opposition kept shorehams bid for a license tied up before 
the commission for years and led the nrc to change its rules in 
late 1987 to allow utilities to formulate evacuation plans assuming 
state and local governments would cooperate in the event of a true 
emergency the same assumption is also being applied in the case of 
the seabrook nh nuclear plant 
at a hearing monday the nrc staff certified shoreham safe and 
ready to operate the nrcs director of nuclear reactor regulation 
said long islands geography roads climate and other features did 
not render emergency planning at shoreham fundamentally more 
difficult than at other sites 
even if the shutdown plan is ratified shoreham almost certainly 
will not die quietly energy secretary james watkins has said that 
to dismantle shoreham would be utterly irresponsible and the 
department says it will try to block transferring shorehams 
license to the long island power authority an entity set up by the 
state legislature to take over the plant 
shoreham located about 90 miles east of new york city was 
conceived in 1965 and completed in 1984 more than 10 years behind 
schedule and almost 75 times over its original 75 million budget 
the plant loaded fuel in january 1985 and received a 5 percent 
lowpower testing license in july 1985 
lilcos applications for 25 percent and fullpower licenses 
stalled before nrc licensing boards and appeal boards as the state 
and local governments contested countless aspects of emergency 
planning 
last year new yorks legislature formed the long island power 
authority to attempt to take over the plant lilco defeated a lipa 
takeover bid last march but new york gov mario cuomo was 
determined to see the plant closed he negotiated a plan in may 
under which lilco would sell the plant to new york state for 1 in 
exchange for guaranteed rate increases of about 70 percent over the 
next 10 years that plan fell apart however when the state 
legislature refused to vote on it before a dec 1 deadline 
later that month a federal jury found lilco guilty of 
racketeering by lying to the state public service commission in 
order to win some 600 million in unjustified rate hikes in the 
1970s the company was faced with paying damages of roughly 18 
billion enough to bankrupt it 
in february lilco agreed to a 400 million settlement of the 
case 390 million to go to ratepayers and 10 million for 
attorneys fees 
on feb 28 cuomo announced that the state and lilco had 
negotiated a new settlement which did not require the legislatures 
approval the second deal did not have builtin rate increases but 
the public service commission set the hikes of up to 5 percent a 
year when it approved the pact last month 
the shareholders have the final say on the deal to scrap the 
plan and lilco chairman william catacosinos has said the board 
will recommend that they accept the deal

presidential assailant john w hinckley jr 
giving his first public testimony won court permission thursday to 
start negotiations to hire assassination buff mark lane as his 
lawyer 
it is my belief that i have the right to choose who will be my 
attorney hinckley told us district judge june l green at a 
hearing on his request to dismiss his longstanding defense team and 
begin discussions with lane 
green gave hinckley permission to interview lane and any other 
prospective attorneys despite reservations expressed by officials 
of a mental hospital where he has been held since he was acquitted 
in 1982 by reason of insanity of shooting president reagan and 
three others in 1981 
a psychiatrist at st elizabeths hospital testified that 
hinckley still suffers from a serious mental illness and has been 
moved from a dormitorystyle room to a maximumsecurity ward 
because he couldnt handle privileges he had previously enjoyed 
hinckley didnt identify lane until the end of his testimony 
when a hospital lawyer asked are you aware that in fact he has 
written a number of books about political assassinations 
i know of one book he has written hinckley told hospital 
attorney janet l maher 
what book is that the judge interjected 
do you want me to just give this persons name because we are 
going to lead into that 
when the judge indicated she wanted an answer hinckley said 
he has written a book called rush to judgment his name is mark 
lane 
lanes 1968 book rush to judgment a citizens dissent 
questioned the findings of the warren commission that lee harvey 
oswald acted alone when he killed president kennedy in 1963 
he has also written numerous articles including a 1980 book 
about the 1978 jonestown massacre in guyana 
maher who argued that letting hinckley interview prospective 
lawyers presents a unique opportunity for exploitation 
reminded hinckley that lane had written a number of books about 
people he had represented in criminal cases 
i dont think its a crime that hes written these books and 
interviewed these people hinckley said i am sure that the 
subjects he has written about at some point gave their consent 
i am capable of deciding whether i want my story told and it 
is not the hospitals say to dictate whether i can do that said 
hinckley who spoke lucidly and appeared relaxed on the witness 
stand 
i should at least be permitted to talk to the man hinckley 
said if we dont get along it stops right there 
hinckley said that he wanted to hire lane because he has 
represented some people who are famous to the general public 
these clients gained their noteerity as criminals in the 
criminal world he added 
among lanes clients was james earl ray who shot the rev 
martin luther king jr in 1968 a fact hinckley acknowledged 
knowing lane represented ray on an attempt to get a retrial of the 
case 
earlier in his testimony hinckley said he had no money to hire 
an attorney because he had depleted all the money in a fund set up 
for him by his family to pay vincent j fuller to defend him during 
his 1982 trial 
i am indigent now but that doesnt mean that in the future 
that i wont be able to make any money hinckley said 
dr raymond f patterson testified that hinckley was competent 
to pick his own attorney 
but patterson expressed concern that people seeking to exploit a 
connection with hinckley would interfere with the treatment he is 
receiving at st elizabeths 
a psychiatrist who until recently has treated hinckley since 
1982 patterson testified that he continues to have difficulty in 
his judgment and has difficulty learning from his past 
experience 
he cant differentiate famous from infamous patterson said 
he does not have a clear perception of how he is seen by others 
he has had to resume a higher level of restriction 
patterson said at one point hinckley was living in a 
dormitorystyle room and in late 1986 hospital authorities allowed 
him to spend time during the christmas holidays with his family at 
a townhouse in suburban virginia 
a request for a similar weekend visit over the easter holiday 
the next year was met with strong opposition by the secret service 
which wasnt formally told of the christmas visit 
the hospital dropped its request after prosecutors produced 
evidence that hinckley had corresponded with serial killer ted 
bundy who was executed earlier this year in florida 
the hospital also abandoned plans to take hinckley on an outing 
with other patients last summer after another cache of writings was 
found in his room 
patterson said hinckley was placed in a maximumsecurity ward 
because he had difficulty handling the privileges previously 
given to him 
hinckley was acquitted in 1982 by reason of insanity of shooting 
reagan thenpresidential press secretary james brady a washington 
police officer and a secret service agent the shooting has left 
brady partially paralyzed 
after the hearing fuller saying he thought hinckley did well 
as a witness said he was glad to be off the case i am 
relieved 
he wanted new counsel hes entitled to it i did not want to 
stand in his way

the soviet union will stop work on two nuclear 
power plants and add safety systems at 14 existing plants to head 
off further disasters like the chernobyl nuclear plant explosion 
and fire tass said thursday 
the soviet news agency said work is being halted on two new 
reactors in smolensk and kursk in central russia that use the same 
graphitecore design as the chernobyl plant in the ukraine tass 
said 
the report seemed to contradict official statements in 1987 that 
no more graphite reactors would be built following the april 26 
1986 accident at chernobyl which killed 31 people and scattered 
bits of nuclear reactor as far as poland 
tass also said the council of ministers formally scrapped plans 
to build two more reactors at chernobyl authorities said two years 
ago no more generators would be built at the disaster site 
the agency quoted vladimir maryin deputy chairman of the fuel 
and energy bureau as saying all 14 nuclear power plants built in 
the 1970s would be refitted to ensure cooling during emergencies 
and to contain radiation leaks 
soviet nuclear plants do not have containment domes as american 
plants do and experts said their design prevents such domes from 
being added now tass did not explain what kind of containment 
system is planned 
maryin interviewed by the newspaper pravitelstvenni vestnik or 
government herald said researchers have begun work on a new 
reactor design they hope to complete by the mid1990s 
the main goal is to develop plants with builtin safety 
features that will make them invulnerable to equipment failures or 
human error he said 
in december soviet officials said that six nuclear power 
projects were scrapped because of earthquake danger or tougher 
standards imposed because of chernobyl on march 18 the government 
permanently closed an armenian nuclear power plant after a 
devastating earthquake hit only 25 miles away 
after chernobyl a public outcry rose for all such nuclear power 
stations to be shut down but soviet authorities refused to do so 
the three remaining reactors at chernobyl continue to operate 
despite the difficulty of protecting the staff from radiation 
contamination

accident 
there are 47 missing or dead johnson said we are in the 
process of identification of the bodies he said relatives would 
be notified before a list was made public 
he said the accident occurred during the loading of the number 
two turret during a routine gun practice wednesday and the fire was 
contained within two hours he did not estimate the extent of the 
dollar damage to turret but he said the rest of the ship escaped 
harm 
i can tell you the fire and explosion was instantaneous 
because it was instantaneous we have no other injuries johnson 
said at a roosevelt roads news conference

president bush said thursday he is still 
trying to establish which guns have suitability for sporting 
purposes as he puts together an anticrime proposal 
as bush weighed what to include in his package a group of 
republican lawmakers urged him to concentrate more on criminals 
than gun control 
bush met with the group seeking ideas on what should result from 
his administrations review of uses of assault weapons which have 
proliferated among street criminals and drug dealers 
the lawmakers urged him to look beyond new regulation of weapons 
and focus instead on construction of prisons and incarceration of 
criminals to deal with a national crime emergency said sen 
phil gramm rtexas who was joined in the meeting with bush by 
sens james mcclure ridaho and arlen specter rpa and rep 
bill mccollom rfla 
bush told reporters that he was talking to a wide array of 
people on this 
he said he had reached no decision yet on what to do about 
assault weapons but added our package will be i guarantee it 
will include more on law enforcement 
i guarantee bill bennett will be totally on board he added 
in reference to his drug policy coordinator who is reported to have 
urged stricter controls on semiautomatic weapons 
bush spoke highly of an opinion he had sought from the head of 
the conservative heritage foundation as to how to balance the 
publics concerns about violent crime with the rights of 
lawabiding gun owners but bush did not say specifically what he 
liked about it 
he called ed feulner up and asked him for his thoughts said 
heritage spokesman herb berkowitz 
the spokesman said only that the memorandum in response tried 
to walk a careful fine line between our constitutional and civil 
libertarian views and the need to address the crime issue 
bush raised the ire of some gunowners in midmarch when he 
announced suspension on imports of semiautomatic assault rifles so 
that the administration could review whether they were being used 
only for sporting purposes as is required by law no similar ban on 
sales of domestically manufactured weapons many of which are 
virtually identical to the imports has been implemented 
gun control advocates are pushing for an expansion of the ban to 
the domestic market citing an escalation in street killings and 
deaths of innocent bystanders but opponents argue that such action 
would impede the rights of lawabiding hunters 
specter after meeting with bush said he anticipates the 
president will come out with a major crime initiative in the 
course of the next several weeks 
the crime package is expected to include provisions on assault 
weapons 
in the meantime bush is soliciting opinions from a wide variety 
of sources said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
hes reaching out and talking to a lot of people on this issue 
while the review is going on she said the review is being 
conducted by the treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms the agency has distributed a questionnaire to a 
variety of gun owners organizations manufacturers and guncontrol 
advocates said ms glen 
the standards that are set up in existing law about import are 
suitability for sporting purpose and were being very careful 
here but were gong to make a determination using that as a 
standard bush told reporters 
various congressional bills in the works deal with gun control 
issues 
specter said he is confident a definition can be developed that 
will separate assault weapons from legitimate semiautomatic hunting 
weapons 
but mcclure said he does not believe that is possible 
he is proposing legislation to require a criminalrecord check 
of gun purchasers but he does not favor requiring any waiting 
period to conduct the check he said a nationwide computerized 
system must be set up using law enforcement data that gun sellers 
would have access to 
gramm specter and mcclure said they advocated a heightened 
emphasis on prison construction and alternative jail ideas gramm 
suggested using the national guard for construction of temporary 
prisons on military bases

the bush administration says a major 
agricultural subsidy called the export enhancement program has not 
been suspended but a farm state senator said thursday thats not 
how it appears to him 
we maintain that a suspension is in place said sen robert 
kerrey dneb in a letter to the office of management and budget 
he said that while a new wheat initiative under the program is 
pending at the budget office officials there have instructed the 
department of agriculture not to send them completed documents 
proposing sales under the program for other commodities such as 
vegetable oil rice and broilers until the administration 
completes a broad review 
a spokeswoman at the budget office said the program has not been 
suspended and that two applications have been processed this year 
the spokeswoman who spoke only on condition she not be quoted by 
name said she did not know how many applications were awaiting 
processing 
she said a meeting would be held in about two weeks to review 
the effectiveness of the program 
the export enhancement program subsidizes us commodity sales 
overseas to make them less expensive for foreign buyers 
kerrey said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter gave 
assurances that it was not suspended while it underwent a general 
review 
kerrey called the program perhaps the single most effective 
tool for securing progress in trade negotiations and urged budget 
director richard darman to end the eep suspension now in place 
earlier in the week thomas o kay administrator of the us 
foreign agricultural service told a senate subcommittee that the 
program was no longer budget neutral and that the budget office 
had ordered it suspended 
all that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations 
that might be made under the program yeutter said earlier this 
week those will be considered on a casebycase basis primarily 
because of our stocks of grain condition and the weather 
conditions that now prevail

thai sources said thursday that 
vietnamesebacked forces have been pounding khmer rouge refugee 
camps near the cambodian border with heavy artillery fire but the 
secretive guerrilla organization has refused to allow evacuation of 
its wounded 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
shelling had caused many casualties and the refugees had been 
driven deeper into thailand 
as many as 4000 shells fired from inside cambodia crashed into 
a wide area along thailands eastern trat province on monday and 
tuesday and more landed the following day the military and other 
sources said on condition of anonymity the area was reported quiet 
on thursday 
they just covered the whole area with shells one source 
said 
they said the areas struck included the unaided camp of ta 
luan which housed about 6000 refugees and kaiche a nearby camp 
where the khmer rouge have not allowed western access but where 
10000 or more civilians were believed held 
thousands of the refugees sought shelter deeper inside thailand 
including about 2000 who fled from kaiche to ta luan sources 
said ta luan is a few miles inside thailand 
the sources quoted the fleeing cambodians as saying they 
witnessed others killed or wounded but no overall count was 
possible in ta luan at least several wounded people some 
seriously hurt were inside houses and underground shelters some 
evidently were moved there from a camp hospital because there were 
no shelters near the hospital sources said 
thai military sources said more than 100 houses in ta luan were 
destroyed other sources said the artillery and rocket rounds 
carved craters there and outside the camp 
a military source said many thais were evacuated from villages 
in the area but that a 56yearold man was killed 
the khmer rouge have not sent any wounded to thai hospitals or 
to the border hospital of the international red cross officials 
have said the khmer rouge fear that these people will defect if 
they are allowed outside the camps 
urs boegli head of the red cross delegation in thailand said 
after visiting the stricken area the red cross is very 
concerned and is negotiating with the thai government to find a 
solution for these people in danger and in particular to be able 
to evacuate the wounded to the hospital at khaoidang which was 
set up for exactly this kind of emergency 
a military source said thai authorities were considering 
evacuating the cambodians at ta luan to a safer site 
widespread human rights abuses have been reported in refugee 
camps in thailand run by the communist khmer rouge which killed 
hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled cambodia in 197578 
and attempted to implement a radical agrarian revolution 
the khmer rouge now is the strongest of three guerrilla groups 
fighting vietnamese forces that invaded cambodia in late 1978 and 
the forces of the vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government 
a thai military source speculated that either vietnamese or 
allied cambodian government forces forces shelled the ta luan area 
to hurt the khmer rouge as much as possible before vietnams 
promised troop pullout which is to be completed by sept 30 
the area of the shelling includes major guerrilla strongholds 
other sources said the attack may have been aimed at detering a 
renewed khmer rouge scheme to relocate people from ta luan to 
kaiche and other areas closer to the cambodia border for military 
purposes 
vietnamese leader nguyen van linh reportedly flew to moscow 
thursday for talks with president mikhail s gorbachev on vietnams 
planned military pullout from cambodia 
accompanying linh on the fourday visit was foreign minister 
nguyen co thach the countrys main negotiator on the cambodian

a revised congressional estimate suggests the 
government may be collecting more in taxes than had been previously 
projected in medicares program to cover catastrophic illnesses 
sen lloyd bentsen said thursday 
the texas democrat chairman of the senate finance committee 
wrote to treasury secretary nicholas brady to ask whether the 
treasury department agrees with revised estimates by the 
congressional budget office and legislative tax staff experts that 
the government will have 49 billion available in excess funds in 
198993 
the congressional budget office concludes that the surplus in 
the catastrophic care funds is twice as large as originally 
estimated two times bigger than needed to provide adequate reserve 
and contingency margins bentsen told reporters 
according to preliminary estimates this would mean a cut of at 
least 16 percent in the supplemental premium revenue could be 
made said bentsen 
the law requires everyone eligible for medicare who pays at 
least 150 a year in federal income taxes to pay an extra premium 
based on that tax liability with the maximum such supplemental 
premium this year of 800 per beneficiary or 1600 per couple 
if both spouses are eligible for medicare 
bentsens letter suggested that the cap on the supplemental 
premium could be reduced to 500 for this year if the revenue 
estimates are correct 
lawmakers have been flooded with mail from the elderly 
protesting the tax paid by beneficiaries bentsen said that it 
was never our intention that the beneficiaries pay more than needed 
to operate this program in a prudent responsible fashion 
this could be potentially good news for medicare beneficiaries 
particularly for those paying the supplemental premium said 
horace deets executive director of the american association for 
retired persons 
aarp always believed that the benefits in the catastrophic 
health care law were important to older americans were even more 
delighted to hear that beneficiaries may pay less for the expanded 
medicare coverage deets added 
there are two reasons for us to interpret this as 
encouraging said eric shulman legislative director for the 
national council of senior citizens 
one is that hopefully this new revenue will yield tangible and 
significant reduction in premiums the other is that it may open 
the door to some reconsideration of the financing mechanism said 
shulman

pallbearers carried the 
flagdraped coffins through an honor guard of enlisted men thursday

navy secretary william l ball iii appeared for president george 
bush and said the president who served in the navy during world 
war ii knows the special agony which is like no other that 
attends the loss of a shipmate 
the sacrifice made by these men is a jolting reminder of the 
dangers faced by those who freely make that choice and serve at 
sea ball said 
ball said he hoped the sailors go to their graves certain in 
the knowledge that a grateful nation will not forget that we find 
their pride in themselves to be hardearned and welldeserved

eleven crewmen escaped from inside the turret and 10 to 12 
crewmen suffered minor injuries while fighting the fire the navy

both said the explosion in the no 2 turret could have been 
triggered by redhot debris from earlier firings in the threegun 
turret 
but cmdr mark baker chief of the navys pentagon press office 
said later that none of the turrets three guns had been fired 
only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a 
training exercise had been fired he said and all had been from 
the no 1 turret forward of the one that exploded 
no eyewitnesses survived wednesdays explosion behind one of the 
16inch guns on the iowa one of the largest warships ever 
pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the 
exact cause of the disaster the worst to strike a navy ship since 
1977 but two officers capt paul hanley a fleet spokesman and 
capt larry seaquist the ships former captain said a possible 
explanation was that redhot debris from a previous round ignited 
new charges 
but seaquist stressed we simply do not know what caused that 
powder to go 
baker said no guns in the no 2 turret had been fired and the 
order had just been given to the no 2 turret crew to load and 
prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred 
we have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired defense 
secretary dick cheney told reporters as he headed back to 
washington from a nato meeting in brussels 
the iowa sailed to roosevelt roads navy base in puerto rico to 
unload the bodies which were then flown to delaware navy 
investigators boarded the ship as it left for norfolk where it is 
expected to arrive sunday or monday 
navy secretary william ball attended a memorial service at the 
delaware base home of the armed services largest mortuary the 
flagdraped coffins were carried off a plane by navy honor guards 
around the united states navy officers and chaplains broke the 
bad news to the dead mens next of kin 
the job began just before midnight wednesday when officials in 
norfolk received the list of the dead 
ive done it many times and ill never get used to it said 
cmdr doug palmer acting chaplain for the norfolk navy base five 
men had families in the norfolk area 
the commander of the us 2nd fleet adm jerome johnson who 
was on board the iowa told reporters in puerto rico the fire 
and explosion was instantaneous 
cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun 
house at the top of the turret rather than the mechanical 
compartments and ammunition magazines below it 
eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at 
the base of the turret a dozen crew members suffered minor 
injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion they were 
treated and returned to duty said pentagon spokesman fred hoffman 
at the white house president bush brushed aside suggestions 
that the explosion was due to the age of the iowa a world war ii 
leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of 
the reagan administration 
asked about the ships safety bush said he wanted to insure 
that procedures were checked to be sure that safety is at the 
highest point but i wouldnt jump to the conclusion that 
because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way 
that makes a useful platform obsolete 
adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey 
began the board of inquirys investigation hoffman said he could 
not predict when the investigation would be completed 
seaquist told reporters it seems from the reports that those 
powders exploded he referred to the six 110pound sacks of 
powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1900pound 
shell 
seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from 
the breech at a guns rear must be operated manually each gun has 
a oneinch diameter tube carrying air under 3000 pounds of 
pressure to blow debris from the 62foot barrel 
the only officer killed was lt jg phillip edward buch from 
las cruces nm who would normally be in a small compartment at 
the rear of the swivelling top of the turret adjacent to the room 
in which shells are loaded 
naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can 
occur if a gun breech is cracked or from a shell that cooks 
off ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or 
smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round 
the first thing that comes to mind is something like a 
cookoff said hanley it could have been a bag or a 
projectile we just dont know yet 
none of the four battleships of the iowa class which saw 
service in world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars has ever 
sustained such an explosion pentagon officials said 
wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the 
navy since a 1977 accident off spain in which 49 sailors died when 
a launch returning them to the uss guam and the uss trenton was 
struck by a spanish freighter 
except for two world war ii japanese battleships and the current 
navy aircraft carriers the 58000ton ships of the iowa class are 
the largest warships in the world

the us government on thursday 
donated 11000 bottles of purple ink to be used to prevent voters 
from casting more than one ballot in national elections set for may 
1 
the donation made through the agency for international 
development followed a request from the paraguayan government 
opposition politicians had cited widespread election irregularities 
during the 34year rule of gen alfredo stroessner 
in february 1988 when stroessner was elected to his eighth 
presidential term the number of votes in favor of the ruling 
colorado party exceeded the number of registered voters in 39 of 
220 districts 
the may 1 presidential and congressional elections are the first 
since stroessner was toppled in a coup feb 3 by gen andres 
rodriguez 
this is a donation from the government of the united states 
for the benefit of national democracy said electoral board 
president expedito rojas at a ceremony attended by representatives 
from seven of the eight parties participating in the election 
the purple dye lasts on the finger for several days the 11000 
bottles are enough to mark 4 million people another shipment was 
expected later this week 
the donation represents part of the continued commitment of 
the goverment to encourage and contribute to democracy in 
paraguay a statement from the us embassy said

southwest senators want national drug czar 
william j bennett to declare the usmexico border a 
highintensity drug trafficking area claiming three grisly 
drugrelated mass murders in the past month are a brutal reminder 
that drug cartels have expanded and moved west 
such a designation would allow the temporary reassignment of 
federal personnel to the region and would funnel assistance to 
state and local agencies 
law enforcement officials in arizona and texas who have been 
involved in the murder investigations say the situation is 
reminiscent of south florida in the late 70s and early 80s 
according to the letter thursday from the borderstate senators 
the eight senators argue the 2000mile border qualifies as a 
center of illegal drug production manufacturing importation and 
distribution a prerequisite to receiving the emergency drug 
designation 
they point to the fact that mexico is the primary producer of 
marijuana and heroin entering the united states that california is 
one of the largest domestic producers of marijuana and that 
california new mexico and texas are three of the largest us 
producers of methamphetamine 
the border patrol has seized more cocaine and marijuana in the 
first six months of fiscal 1989 than in all of fiscal 1988 and the 
customs service reports cocaine seizures are up 425 percent in the 
past three years the senators said 
in los angeles alone the drug enforcement administration said 
15 tons of cocaine were seized in 1988 
the senators also say federal reserve figures show los angeles 
as the new center for collection of drug profits the citys 
federal reserve bank has a 38 billion cash surplus a 2200 
percent jump since 1985 during the same time miamis federal 
reserve cash surplus declined by 12 billion 
although state and local agencies have committed dramatically 
increased assets and personnel to drug enforcement they are being 
overwhelmed by drugrelated crime said the senators from 
california arizona new mexico and texas 
the senators also argue drugrelated activity on the border is 
having a harmful impact on other parts of the country they point 
to crack operations set up in 50 major cities around the country by 
two violent los angeles gangs the crips and the bloods also 
texas california and arizona are three of the top five 
distribution centers of illegal drugs in the united states they 
said 
us attorneys are being overwhelmed by drug cases while budget 
shortfalls cutbacks or personnel shortages plague various federal 
agencies including customs dea fbi and border patrol the 
senators said 
also they said the area is experiencing an alarming abuse 
problem 
the letter is signed by sens lloyd bentsen dtexas phil

the general assembly condemned israel 
thursday for alleged human rights abuses and demanded it halt 
excessive gunfire and restrictions on worship in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
the vote was 1292 with one abstention in the 159member 
assembly 
the united states and israel voted against the nonbinding 
resolution and liberia abstained other nations were absent 
the assembly resolution backed by arab nonaligned and 
socialist nations also demands that israel immediately halt its 
crackdown and punishment of those participating in the 16monthold 
palestinian uprising in the territories 
it was the latest in frequent un condemnations of israel and 
its policies us ambassador thomas r pickering described the 
resolution as confrontational and a israeli diplomat called 
the vote hypocritical 
pickering said it does not improve the situation on the ground 
or advance the prospects for peace in the region 
he said the united states seeks a comprehensive negotiated 
settlement that would provide for an exchange of territory for 
peace the security of all states and the legitimate political 
rights of the palestinian people 
the us envoy said the status quo in the occupied territories 
is untenable and called the april 13 deaths of four 
palestinians by israeli gunfire in the west bank town of nahalin 
a particularly serious tragedy 
israeli envoy jeremy nissim issacharoff first secretary at his 
mission denounced the immense hypocrisy by arab nations such 
as iraq saudi arabia and syria to condemn israel 
he said the saudi government does not permit religious freedom 
and slaughtered iranian worshippers in mecca several years ago 
iraq has killed thousands of its own kurdish peopls and syria has 
murdered lebanese he said yet both nations lecture israel about 
the evils of occupation and violations of human rights 
the resolution expresses profound shock at the israeli 
killings in nahalin and cited restrictions on attendance at moslem 
mosques during the holy period of ramadan as a violation of 
palestinian rights to worship 
the resolution demands that israel immediately halt its 
violations of the convention and respect all palestinian rights 
the territories home to 17 million palestinians were seized 
by israel from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
at least 439 palestinians have been killed since the december 
1987 start of the uprising most by army gunfire according to a 
count by the associated press eighteen israelis have also died

disposal of eight old closed reactors 
that produced plutonium fuel for the nations nuclear weapons could 
cost 217 million and take more than 100 years according to a 
draft plan released thursday 
the pioneering reactors some of which date back to the 
manhattan project during world war ii are on the hanford federal 
nuclear reservation in southcentral washington and have been idled 
for years 
no future longterm use of any of the eight surplus production 
reactors has been identified by the doe said the draft 
environmental impact statement by the department of energy 
they are the nations first defense production reactors proposed 
for permanent disposal said roger freeberg chief of hanford 
restoration for the doe 
although the reactors nuclear fuel has long been removed they 
are still contaminated with 98100 curies of tritium 37400 curies 
of carbon14 74400 curies of cobalt60 and other radioactive 
materials that could threaten workers and the environment the plan 
said a curie is a measure of radioactivity 
that is why they must be decommissioned or placed in a condition 
that ensures public safety and protects the environment doe said 
five disposal alternatives from burying the reactors to 
leaving them intact were discussed in the report 
the energy department will choose one of the five alternatives 
by late 1990 freeberg said none of the disposal methods pose any 
radiation threat to the public the report said 
the eight hulking reactors built between 1943 and 1955 stand a 
few miles apart along the columbia river they employed thousands 
of workers making highly radioactive plutonium for the nations 
nuclear weapons 
but from 1964 to 1971 they were shut down one by one as the need 
for plutonium which lasts thousands of years diminished 
only one operable defense reactor the n reactor remains at 
hanford and it is closed because of a plutonium surplus the 
nations only other defense reactors are at the savannah river 
plant in south carolina 
among reactors slated for decommissioning is the b reactor the 
worlds first fullsize nuclear reactor it was built during a 
crash 15month period in 19431944 as the nation raced to develop 
an atomic bomb before nazi germany in fact the nazis were far 
from developing nuclear weapons 
the reactor sites should not be abandoned because maintenance is 
needed to prevent the release of the remaining radioactivity the 
report said 
alternatives studied were 
continue the present routine monitoring and maintenance over 
100 years this would cost 41 million in 1986 dollars with 
minimal radiation doses to workers 
however at the end of 100 years the reactors and some 
radioactive contamination would remain requiring additional work 
the report said 
immediately move the 9000 to 11000ton reactor vessels to a 
hanford burial site several miles away this would take about 12 
years for all eight reactors cost about 191 million and be more 
hazardous for workers 
wait 75 years for radiation levels to subside before moving the 
reactor vessels to the burial site that would allow radioactive 
cobalt 60 a significant threat to workers to decay and reduce 
worker exposure to radiation by an estimated twothirds 
this plan would cost 198 million and take 87 years before all 
12 reactors would be buried 
wait 75 years and then dismantle each reactor so the waste 
could more easily be transported for burial this plan is most 
expensive at 217 million and would take 103 years for all eight 
reactors 
worker exposure is over 10 times greater than any other 
alternative because workers would be inside the reactor vessel the 
report said 
bury the 46feettall reactor vessels under 16 feet of soil at 
their present sites after the surrounding buildings have been 
removed 
this plan would take five to six years to complete at a total 
cost of 181 million except for the proposal to maintain present 
conditions this is the safest alternative for workers

un relief officials thursday demanded that 
israel stop using gunfire to quell palestinian protests and moslem 
clerics urged palestinians to defy israeli restrictions on worship 
at jerusalems al aqsa mosque 
in the gaza strip at least 16 palestinians were reported 
wounded in stonethrowing clashes with troops 
the un relief and works agency which aids palestinian 
refugees said 13 palestinians six of them younger than 15 were 
shot to death by israeli troops in the past week 
we deplore this loss of life and call for a halt to the use of 
lethal firepower against civilians young and old the agency 
said in a statement issued in vienna and distributed in jerusalem 
an army spokeswoman defended the troops saying they do 
everything in their power to avoid deaths she said every 
palestinian death is being investigated by a senior officer 
the un agency criticism came the same day the un general 
assembly voted 1292 to condemn israel for alleged human rights 
abuses and demand it halt excessive gunfire and restrictions on 
worship the united states and israel voted against the nonbinding 
resolution and liberia abstained 
under army policy troops may fire live ammunition only when 
their lives are in danger plastic bullets which can be fatal when 
fired from a range of less than 70 yards may be used to break up 
violent protests or stop fleeing inciters 
at least 439 palestinians have been killed since the december 
1987 start of the uprising most by army gunfire according to a 
count by the associated press eighteen israelis have also died 
the un agency on thursday put the palestinian death toll at 
442 and said nearly 25000 have been wounded by army gunfire 
it also protested the prolonged closure of the west banks 1200 
schools including 90 run by the un agency 
the military government has kept schools closed for most of the 
uprising saying they are flashpoints of antiisraeli violence the 
latest military order extended school closures until may 19 
if they schools cannot reopen before the end of next month 
and are not allowed to remain open through the summer months a 
whole school year will be lost the un agency said 
a military government official said no date has been set for 
reopening schools calling the situation too tense for such a move 
palestinians have alleged the school closures are a form of 
punishment 
in jerusalem al aqsa preacher sheikh mohammed al jamal called 
on moslems in the occupied territories to attend friday noon 
prayers at the mosque to challenge the israeli restrictions 
the police order was enacted after palestinians stoned police in 
the mosque compound following prayers on april 7 the first friday 
of the moslem holy month of ramadan 
on april 14 police turned away most west bank and gaza strip 
palestinians trying to reach the mosque compound known as haram al 
sharif the third holiest site of islam after mecca and medina in 
saudi arabia 
we call on moslems to perform friday prayers at al aqsa 
mosque al jamal told reporters 
if the israeli authorities prevent moslems from entering the 
mosque they are to pray in the old city of jerusalem if they are 
barred from entering the city they are to pray on the roads 
leading to jerusalem he said 
in the occupied gaza strip the army shot and wounded 12 
palestinians during stonethrowing clashes in the khan yunis 
refugee camp an army official said arab doctors only confirmed 
three casualties in the camp 
the reason for the discrepancy was not clear usually arab 
casualty reports exceed the figures confirmed by the army 
arab hospital officials said four other palestinians were 
wounded in clashes in the village of beit hanoun the town of 
rafah and the nuseirat and shati refugee camps the army said it 
was checking the report

senators plan to start hearing evidence 
against us district court judge alcee l hastings on july 10 a 
special committee formed for his impeachment trial said thursday 
the panel made the decision in a closeddoors meeting wednesday 
in the meeting the committee headed by sen jeff bingaman 
dnm also set aug 4 as a target date for wrapping up the 
presentation of evidence according to spokesman tony harvey 
harvey said the committee decided to defer any decision on a 
request from hastings attorney terence anderson of miami for 
200000 in expenses from the government and an unspecified amount 
in fees to conduct the defense of the 52yearold judge 
hastings of miami was named in 17 articles of impeachment 
approved by the house 4133 on aug 3 the document accuses him of 
plotting to obtain a payoff and improperly disclosing secret 
wiretap information 
the senate must now decide whether to convict hastings and thus 
remove him from office and stop his 89500 annual salary 
the committees proceedings will be carried on senate television 
and also videotaped for viewing later by lawmakers who are not on 
the 12member panel 
the committee will not issue any recommendation on whether to 
convict hastings but merely a report on the evidence against him 
the final decision on whether to remove him from the bench will be 
made by the whole senate 
the impeachment trial before the senate is not the same thing as 
a criminal trial and the worst that can befall hastings if 
convicted is removal from office 
a federal court jury acquitted him of the bribe conspiracy at a 
1983 trial but his alleged coconspirator washington attorney 
william borders was convicted at a separate trial and sent to 
prison 
harvey described the committees target date of aug 4 as a 
very firm goal and objective but acknowledged that the panel was 
not absolutely bound to stick by it under any circumstances 
a witness list submitted to the committee indicated the hastings 
camp plans to call more than 108 persons including former attorney 
general griffin bell as well as an assortment of fbi agents 
alleged organized crime figures political operatives and others

a man who bought a 300yearold map of paris 
in a junk shop for 3 may see his investment return as much as 10 
million 
a prospective buyer from denver sent word thursday that he would 
pay edward jones of indianapolis whatever price is set by 
christies the new york auction house and frederick l bein 
geography department head at indiana universitypurdue university 
here 
the buyer originally offered 10 million for the map one of 
several copies believed commissioned by king louis xiv in 1671 
bein said he would be willing to explain its historical 
significance to christies but couldnt place a value on the 
ninepiece 4by5foot map 
what its worth is whatever a buyer is willing to pay for 
it said bein who has researched the map i have no idea what 
its worth im not an art dealer im a professor 
cartographer franquois de la pointe took seven years to complete 
the map assisted by such notables as isaac newton astronomer 
edmund halley for whom the comet is named and christian huygens 
inventor of the pendulum clock bein said 
it accurately depicts paris and its environs as they were in 
1671 and includes the plan for the palace of versailles built by 
louis xiv 
in 1986 christies examined the map and concluded it was 300 
years old at the time the auction house refused to place a value 
on it but lloyds of london insured it for 10 million 
jones stumbled upon the map while rummaging through an 
indianapolis salvation army store in 1985 its brilliant water 
colors were carefully added after it was printed it may be the 
only colored version of the map in existence jones said 
the british museum has a copy although it is in black and 
white others are catalogued in the national archives in france 
after keeping it for four years in a bank vault jones is eager 
to sell it he placed an advertisement four weeks ago and has had 
offers of 7 million 8 million and 85 million from various 
buyers he said 
the offer from the denver buyer who prefers to remain 
anonymous was the largest 
the french government has also expressed interest jones said 
beins research shows the map was the first to employ meridian 
lines of longitude using a technique developed by galileo about 
1600 the technique made the map more accurate and scientific than 
any drawn before 
it was the first accurate map of paris and the beginning of a 
100year project to map all of france bein said 
the map also introduced the use of hachuring a method of 
showing elevation that cartographers employed for hundreds of years 
there were a number of copies it was made on copper plates 
bein said how many were run off who knows 
jones 44 admitted being nervous at possibly attaining 
millionaire status after living on a 20000 income he has no 
plans for the money other than paying off investors 
i guess ill do some things with god whatever he lays on my 
heart he said

hundred demonstrators thursday in the north coast town of port 
louis over the arrests of seven proindependence activists in this 
french caribbean island 
the demonstrators set up huge roadblocks across the main roads 
leading to and from the town although the violent clashes had 
ceased by noon banks schools stores and all government offices 
remained closed 
the political unrest began following the arrests tuesday of 
seven proindependence activists or supporters of the tiny popular 
union for the liberation of guadeloupe 
the seven are charged with bomb attacks in january 1988 on a 
bank and the homes of five french european residents including a 
lawyer a doctor and an army officer 
among those arrested was jean barfleur a prominent member of 
the popular union and a member of the towns city council

wednesday that the arrests are a new maneuver by the french 
government to repress the freedom of the independence movement 
police did not say how long the seven would be detained or 
exactly what they were charged with 
a police statement said the arrests were closely connected 
to the creation of a new revolutionary organization based in 
port louis one of the few towns in this island of 340000 where a 
large number of people support independence from france 
police gave no details on the alleged organization 
one of the alleged bombers is still at large but local news 
reports say he can be identified because he lost two fingers in the 
explosion in front of one of the bombing targets the fingers 
allegedly were recovered by the police 
a number of unions and organizations including the guadeloupean 
communist party have denounced the arrests

world chess champion garri kasparov and 
yugoslav grandmaster ljubomir ljubojevic tied for first place in 
the fourth chess world cup tournament thursday when kasparov 
defeated former world champion boris spassky in the final round 
kasparov 26 and ljubojevic 38 each finished with 11 points 
out of a possible 16 soviet grandmaster valery salov came in third 
with 10 points and viktor korchnoi a soviet defector who now 
plays for switzerland came in fourth 9 points 
the world cup a series of six tournaments staged over two years 
and featuring a total prize fund of 12 million is widely 
regarded as the second most important chess event after the world 
championship 
ljubojevic who went into the final round a half point ahead of 
kasparov agreed to a rapid 10move draw with british grandmaster 
nigel short 
this enabled kasparov to tie for first with a win over spassky 
for 7 years kasparov has won or tied for first place in every 
chess event in which he has participated if ljubojevic had won his 
final game kasparovs run would have been broken 
im very pleased with my game today but i think nigel was a 
little impolite because he didnt play kasparov said moments 
after his victory 
kasparov had expected short who had the advantage of the white 
pieces to play for a win against ljubojevic 
with his victory kasparov remains within striking distance of 
bobby fischers record as the highestranked player in history 
tournament organizers said the winners each would earn 17500 
they said kasparov who has better tiebreakers would receive 
the trophy for first place in the tournament but ljubojevic will 
finish a halfpoint ahead of kasparov in the world cup calculations 
this is because one of the competitors spanish grandmaster 
miguel illescas is playing as a representative of the host nation 
and is not one of the 25 top grandmasters eligible for the world 
cup 
results against illescas are removed from the standings before 
the world cup calculations are made kasparov who defeated 
illescas in the 16th round will have a point removed from his 
score in the world cup standings while ljubojevic who drew with 
illescas in the eight round will only drop half a point 
kasparov won the second and third tournaments held last year in 
belfort france and reykjavik iceland and currently is leading 
the series former world champion anatoly karpov who won the first 
event in brussels is close behind in second place 
it is not clear if this result will affect kasparovs final 
world cup placing each grandmaster plays in four of the six 
competitions but only their best three results will be counted 
the fifth tournament in the series will be staged in the dutch 
port city of rotterdam in june the final event featuring a 
kasparovkarpov clash is scheduled for august in skelleftea 
northern sweden 
many of thursdays other games were agreed drawn quickly by 
grandmasters exhausted by three weeks of topflight competition 
korchnoi playing with the advntage of the white pieces agreed 
to a draw with salov after only 10 moves while the game between 
british grandmaster jonathan speelman and johann hjartarson of 
iceland was drawn in 15 moves 
short and robert huebner of west germany finished in a tie for 
fifth place with nine points huebner and alexander belyavsky of 
the soviet union battled for six hours before finally agreeing to a 
draw 
predrag nikolic of yugoslavia drew his game with soviet 
grandmaster artur yusupov and finished eighth among the seventeen 
competitors with eight points out of 16

police handed citations to thousands of gang 
members thursday branding them members of criminal organizations 
in the first step of enforcing a new law aimed against street 
terrorism 
up until this law it was not a crime to belong to the crips 
it was not a crime to belong to the bloods or any of these other 
criminal hispanic street gangs district attorney ira reiner said 
at a news conference 
whats illegal reiner said is doing anything to help pursue 
the gangs criminal objectives 
if you belong to one of these gangs and you know what theyre 
about and thats easy enough to prove and you do any act in 
furtherance of their criminal activity then you have committed a 
felony by virtue of your membership in that gang reiner said 
for example the law allows the prosecution of a cited gang 
member who only lends a car that is used in a driveby shooting 
because he has been formally told the gang is a criminal street 
gang 
gang violence claimed more than 350 lives across the nations 
most populous county last year many victims are innocent 
bystanders caught in the crossfire 
you are hereby notified that the venice shoreline crips gang 
is a criminal street gang read a sample citation shown to 
reporters those served with the notice printed in english and 
spanish are asked to sign a receipt 
officials said the notices should be easy to serve because of 
gang members high visibility on their home turf law officers 
familiarity with them and the gang ethic which forbids them from 
denying membership in their set 
reiner was joined at the news conference by city attorney james 
hahn whose office also will be able to enforce the law as 
misdemeanor offense 
his office previously filed a civil lawsuit against the playboy 
gangster crips claiming they were a nuisance but that action only 
brought short jail stays through contempt of court actions until 
legal challenges defeated it 
reiner acknowledged that the california street terrorism 
enforcement and prevention act will be subject to legal challenges 
and wont cure the regions gang problem 
the new law took effect jan 1 but the los angeles county 
sheriffs office and police from los angeles compton long beach 
pomona and pasadena reviewed the targeted gangs to make sure they 
met the laws criteria 
the departments had prepared 3700 notices for thursday those 
being served include a mixture of various offshoots of the 
bloods crips and hispanic street gangs the dirtiest gangs in the 
area said district attorney office spokeswoman sandi gibbons 
under the law the gang has to consist of three or more members 
and engaged in at least two or more crimes enumerated in the law 
assault with a deadly weapon robbery homicide or manslaughter 
sale or possession of narcotics and controlled substances shooting 
in an inhabited dwelling or vehicle arson or witness intimidation 
reiner said the law was written to avoid the pitfall of previous 
efforts to link relationships with undesirable characters as 
criminal activities known as status offender laws which were 
struck down by the us supreme court 
prosecutors will have to show that defendants were active gang 
members that they knew of the gangs criminal activity and engaged 
in an act that furthered that activity all of which keep the law 
a constitutional distance from guilt by association reiner claimed

a trembling man entered a restaurant 
sat across from another man and began arguing he pulled a pistol 
and talked about his brothers hospitalization drugs money and 
the police 
the argument which nearly ended in a shootout was just a 
play but a patron at louies restaurant was not amused 
the first performance of jokereye a play by brown 
university junior craig picone almost started a real fight 
saturday when a louies patron who also is a brown student 
realized the confrontation was a hoax and angrily confronted the 
actors and director 
dave ronick miffed by the performance said although the 
theater group posted notices in louies windows they failed to 
indicate the time and certainly didnt say anything about the use 
of guns in louies 
i directed it with realism in mind said jason neulander a 
brown sophomore 
he said he decided to move it off the traditional stage after a 
customer listened to the actors reading the play in louies and 
said it sounded real 
the play involves two armed men phil and jimmy arguing about a 
drug exchange and the waitress who serves them in a restaurant 
the actors borrowed real guns from the brown theater department a 
22caliber handgun and a 357caliber magnum 
i wanted to see with an unknowing audience what happened and 
how they would react neulander said 
ronick and a friend had briefly contemplated grabbing for the 
guns and other options before a waitress told them what was going 
on ronick said a lot of people were stunned and the use of guns in 
public infuriated him 
an english major ronick followed the two actors out of louies 
and told them what he thought of their performance he later 
grabbed the director by the shirt collar 
if you were in new york you would have gotten shot ronick 
a new yorker told them 
the actors were totally freaked out said neulander who was 
inside louies paying the bill when the confrontation occurred 
the actors had anticipated anger neulander said they wanted 
the audience to become part of the play to break the wall between 
players and spectators he said 
but he said the actors werent ready for a response directed 
at them personally 
it was poor judgment on their part said providence police 
commander richard s tamburiniit could have led to a tragedy

military officials said thursday 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules

informer 
police said four other bodies were found in neighboring 
kamburupittiya village the bodies as yet unidentified had 
gunshot wounds police said 
it was not known if the incidents were connected 
the violence came as staterun television repeated president 
ranasinghe premadasas longstanding amnesty offer to militants on 
both sides who surrender 
sinhalese extremists began their antigovernment campaign in 
july 1987 to protest a government peace plan with the tamils who 
are fighting for an independent state on the islands north and 
east 
the sinhalese complain too much is conceded to the tamils who 
form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people tamils claim they 
are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent 
of the population 
india sponsored the plan and later sent in troops to enforce an 
arms surrender by the tamil insurgents because of the sympathies of 
its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause 
the more radical tamil groups continued their separatist fight 
begun in 1983 
at least 12600 people have died in the separatist campaign and 
the sinhalese backlash

an earthquake measuring 65 on the richter 
scale shook the stanovoy mountains in eastern soviet union on 
thursday according to the us geological survey 
there were no reports of damage or casualties from the 
earthquake recorded at 5 pm mdt it was the strongest reported 
in the the southeastern siberian mountains since a quake measuring 
66 was recorded jan 18 1967 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs each increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

foreign service officers that it discriminated against women and 
they may be eligible for courtordered relief the washington post 
reported 
the admission was part of a notice sent to diplomatic posts 
worldwide and posted at state department headquarters as the latest 
step in a long legal process the newspaper reported in its 
thursday editions 
in addition the state department has canceled the 1989 foreign 
service examination department officials said wednesday night

1976 by alison palmer a nowretired foreign serivce officer who 
claimed the department discriminated against women in hiring and 
promotion 
the state department had won in a lower court but was reversed 
three months ago by the us court of appeals for the district of 
columbia the state department is planning to appeal that decision 
the post said 
in the meantime the state department has been proceeding with a 
detailed plan to notify female employees of discrimination between 
1976 and 1985 the newspaper reported 
men got better career assignments and were generally given more 
highprofile opportunities to advance their careers according to

senators threatened with a disrupted vacation 
overwhelmingly adopted president bushs savings and loan rescue 
after bowing to a lastminute plea to strengthen a key reform 
dwarfing all other government bailouts the plan approved 
wednesday would provide at least 157 billion over the next decade 
most of it from taxpayers to close or merge 350 failed thrift 
institutions and make good on government pledges in the rescue of 
200 others last year 
it would also reorganize the regulatory bureaucracy provide 50 
million a year for the justice department to pursue fraud in sampls 
and enact other reforms chief among them a requirement that thrift

president bush is facing increasing 
congressional criticism over his handling of the alaska oil spill 
and a public opinion poll shows a sharp drop in the presidents 
rating on environmental issues 
a hearing before the senate environmental protection 
subcommittee wednesday was marked by repeated questioning of 
administration witnesses on why the federal government did not move 
more quickly to control the spill and limit its spread along 
alaskas southern coast 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine suggested bush 
was far too slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster 
and said federal laws should be changed to require that the federal 
government assume control of such a spill immediately unless it is 
clear the cleanup is going properly in private hands 
because of the unbelievably slow response by not only 
industry but also the bush administration there has never been a 
time when this situation was under control said sen max baucus 
dmont chairman of the environmental subcommittee 
meanwhile a coalition of environmental groups today released a 
poll indicating that the spill has affected how bush is perceived 
in dealing with environmental issues 
the telephone survey conducted by lou harris amp associates shows 
a 21 percent drop in the number of people who believe bush is doing 
a good job in handling environmental matters according to debra 
callahan executive director of americans for the environment the 
poll was based on telephone interviews with 1250 people nationwide 
between march 26 and march 30 ms callahan said the margin of 
error was not immediately available

the austerity program china began seven months 
ago has undone many muchvaunted economic reforms and is 
threatening the profit incentives that gave them success 
some economists worry that the chinese governments clampdown on 
construction loans and government spending will do more harm than 
good to an economy afflicted by 36 percent inflation and critical 
shortages of electricity and most raw materials 
the economic reforms set in motion 10 years ago set a course 
now being followed by other communist countries including the 
soviet union to loosen state controls and permit some sectors to 
operate for profit 
but the chinese have applied the brakes 
the economists say the governments austerity threatens to shut 
down the private and rural enterprises that have proved so 
successful leave millions of rural residents jobless and produce 
the same combination of inflation and depression that plagued the 
west in the 1970s 
we can already smell the coming stagflation said a recent 
commentary in the guangzhou canton newspaper asianpacific 
economic times noting that many factories were paralyzed by the 
cash freeze brought on by austerity to get production going again 
it said the government will be forced to print more money fueling 
inflation 
labor expert yang tiren at the peoples university in beijing 
said the economy already has entered a recession evidenced by the 
millions of peasants flocking to cities for jobs because rural 
factories are shutting down 
recession yang added will cause a blow to social and 
economic stability that will be worse than that caused by 
inflation 
it is precisely the communist governments phobia of social 
discontent over price increases that caused it to order the 
economic slowdown in september 
but what began then as a simple cutback on construction waste 
and luxury spending has blossomed into a widereaching program to 
slow down not only industrial growth but also the pace of economic 
and social change 
major changes in the structure of the economic system essential 
to senior leader deng xiaopings decadeold reform program have 
been put on hold or rolled back 
factories that had been gaining autonomy from the government 
for example now need permission to expand production or raise 
product prices orders have gone out to curb worker bonuses a key 
incentive to increase production 
plans to decontrol the prices of staple foods kept artificially 
low with heavy government subsidies have been put off indefinitely 
experimental programs to privatize housing and some companies 
through stock sales have been directly or indirectly halted 
a wide range of powers delegated to local and provincial 
governments have been reclaimed by beijing including budget 
autonomy 
in march the government announced new taxes on private 
businessmen and rural township factories deliberately putting a 
damper on their rapid growth in order to free up scarce electricity 
and supplies for less productive stateowned factories 
farmers are to be taxed for the first time on crops they sell on 
the free market the main source of greater rural prosperity since 
1978 
some economists wonder if the government is not overdoing it 
the austerity policy should be implemented at a much easier 
pace the asianpacific economic times recommended 
economist xiao zhuoji contended the danger of returning to 
the old system is worse than the danger of inflation 
the shanghaibased world economic herald one of chinas most 
outspoken papers recently wondered whether the austeritys goal is 
to establish order in the free market as officials say or to shut 
it down 
gao tiesheng deputy director of policy research at the state 
price bureau said that kind of thinking is naive chinas 
transportation and information networks are not advanced enough for 
westernstyle free markets he said and toorapid reforms have 
proven inflationary and disruptive 
he maintained that the austerity is not a retreat but gives 
china a chance to put its economic house in order before making 
further changes 
but latest government figures indicate the policies are hitting 
wide of the target curbing vital industries but not luxury 
production oil and coal output has virtually stopped growing and 
the government had to give top heavy machinery makers an emergency 
810 million bailout 
meanwhile the production of color television sets has increased 
32 percent despite a new luxury tax 
for the growing number of unemployed the government has adopted 
prereformist damage control premier li peng told factories to 
retain their excess workers rather than shift the burden onto 
society adding to the 20 million urban workers or 15 percent of 
the labor force already considered hidden unemployed 
chen lebo economics editor at the world economic herald called 
rural layoffs a serious problem 
only 10 percent of the rural work force actually works in the 
fields he said if we force the rest to return this will only 
reduce overall rural income 
the official peoples daily acknowledged unemployment is likely 
to get worse and the living conditions of some city and township 
residents will fall 
but this is the price we have to pay it said and if not 
now then the price will be even steeper later

it might seem that time has passed by cbs the 
littlest victims an emotional account of dr james oleskes 
pioneering research into aids in children of six and seven years 
ago 
but the movie is still relevant for its sympathetic portrayal of 
minority aids victims and the response of the research community 
and the reagan administration in the early months of the aids 
crisis 
it may be helped by the fact that it is the first madefortv 
movie to be shot on highdefinition video it airs sunday 
although it will be years before many viewers will own tv sets 
that capture the crisp almost threed picture that highdefinition 
video produces they might notice a slightly sharper image than 
usual 
on a highdefinition monitor the picture is dramatically 
different because hdtv splits the image into twice the number of 
lines for transmission as the current tv picture 
in a screening room in midtown manhattan a group of television 
critics were joined by oleske himself to watch the littlest 
victims on a bigscreen highdefinition tv set the portly 
grayhaired oleske is portrayed in the movie by a handsome svelte 
tim matheson 
after the first 15 minutes i said to myself i look a little 
bit like this guy oleske joked after the screening my kids 
couldnt understand how a tall thin handsome guy could play a 
short fat doctor 
oleske said he has lost about 40 pounds since the events of 
198283 portrayed in the movie a subplot is about his battle with 
heart disease due to overweight 
but the movie is really about the children who became victims of 
acquired immmune deficiency syndrome before scientists even knew 
that a virus caused the fatal disease that attacks its victims 
immune systems rendering them helpless against infection 
oleske a newark njbased pediatric immunologist was 
convinced early on that the children he was seeing were suffering 
from aids they had contracted through their mothers then a 
revolutionary theory in 1982 aids was still considered a gay 
mens disease although it had also begun to turn up in intravenous 
drug abusers 
the movie confronts the social problems surrounding aids and the 
reagan administrations slow response to provide research money 
you mean just because its hitting gays and junkies nobody 
cares an outraged oleske says in the movie this is not that 
kind of country 
later when he learns that his application for a grant from the 
national institutes of health has been approved but not funded 
he rants to his laboratory assistant the government doesnt give 
a damn about the people with aids its written them off already 
the sooner they die the better 
oleske praised cbs for avoiding unreal characterizations of aids 
victims to make them more sympathetic ie white i 
congratulate cbs in making a movie that shows what the real story 
is that most young victims of aids are minority children of 
povertystricken parents 
oleske said doctors must understand the social pressures on 
poor black innercity women to have children often their only 
source of selfesteem when such a woman is told she has a 50 
percent chance of having a baby with aids oleske says what she 
hears is that she has a 5050 chance of having a healthy baby 
nevertheless doctors often respond with disgust when they realize 
a woman has become pregnant despite the risks 
the original title of the movie was innocent victims it was 
changed after oleske complained that it suggested other victims 
must be guilty of something 
its not that way he said they didnt know theyre all 
innocent victims 
oleske said he was somewhat embarrassed by the central role 
of his character in the movie and said attention was due instead to 
the dedicated nurses who care for aids children it is still a 
struggle to find the money to pay the nurses and keep the research 
going he said he donated all the money he made on the movie to a 
childrens hospital 
the only reason i did this and my wife would say sold my 
soul was i needed a social worker desperately and the money for 
this movie would pay for a social worker he said

a vast arctic bay dubbed the golden 
triangle for its unparalleled treasure of fish and wildlife may 
be spared oil exploration because of the catastrophic effects 
nearby of the nations worst oil spill 
three alaska governors and the stubborn fishermen of bristol bay 
have appealed to three presidents to ban oil and gas drilling in 
the bay the richest red salmon grounds in the world 
for 10 years the powerful of washington brushed aside the pleas 
of complainers living far far away last year nine oil companies 
paid 954 million to the federal government to search for oil and 
gas in bristol bay 
this year everythings different now the 4500 people of 
bristol bay a 44000squaremile marine paradise even richer than 
devastated prince william sound are pleading their case again 
hoping that the wreck of the tanker exxon valdez will prompt 
president bush to hand back the money 
with millions of fish threatened thousands of birds dying and 
hundreds of sea otters dead in prince william sound the despairing 
fishermen of western alaska suddenly have environmental clout and 
renewed attention to their cause 
i hate to say it but without a doubt the spill may help us 
save bristol bay said sue flensburg executive director of the 
bristol bay coastal resource service area 
until the huge tanker split open last month the faint outraged 
voices in bristol bay 450 miles southwest of prince william sound 
on the very edge of the continent were literally crying in the 
wilderness 
oilcompany assurances of environmental integrity and safety had 
consistently won out 
they always dangled their success in front of us said 
deborah tennyson executive director of the bristol bay native 
association 
the oil companies and the feds said youre psychotic youre 
paranoid weve shipped millions of gallons of oil out of valdez 
weve got caribou grazing under the pipeline little chicks are 
being born at prudhoe bay and the whales come back year after year 
to prince william sound 
well a massive oil spill is like nuclear war said mrs 
tennyson who fishes along with her whole family during salmon 
season 
if it happens once it would be so horrible that saying 
sorry well never do it again doesnt mean a damned thing if 
something like this happened in bristol bay it would be a cultural 
economic and social holocaust 
bristol bay supports the worlds largest red salmon fishery and 
the largest herring fishery in us waters as well as a majority 
of the worlds northern fur seal population the pacific gray whale 
population and millions of seabirds geese and ducks 
to most alaskans the arguments for bristol bay boil down to 
pure economics a barrel of oil is worth about 20 most of the 
year a ninepound bristol bay red salmon retails in anchorage for 
7425 salmon is more plentiful than oil here they say and it is 
a resource that renews itself 
alaska gov steve cowper claims bristol bays wholesale fishery 
value exceeds 1 billion and employs 10000 people in a good year 
its always been obvious to us that our annual renewable 
resources far outweigh any potential oil and gas gains said ms 
flensburg once oil is gone its gone forever but our fish come 
back every year why cant the federal government understand that 
the oil companies have pressed ahead with bristol bay plans 
despite surveys that show limited oil deposits at best and a 
warning from the us fish and wildlife service dating back to 1978 
that no adequate safeguards could protect bristol bay because of 
strong tidal currents severe winds earthquakes and heavy ice 
ten patches in the bering chukchi and beaufort seas totaling 
480 million acres of ocean bottom have been identified by 
geologists as potential outer continental shelf oil and gas fields 
the interior department pegs bristol bays hydrocarbon potential 
in the bering sea among the lowest in that ocs area with perhaps 
as little as 2 percent of the nations undiscovered offshore 
resources 
experts estimate the area contains anywhere between 63 million 
and 615 million barrels of oil by contrast the prudhoe bay fields 
which feed the transalaska pipeline are estimated at 10 billion 
barrels 
at the most bristol bay could amount to only about a months 
worth of oil consumption for the nation 
alaska officials acutely aware that oil royalties now account 
for more than 80 percent of the states revenue long ago learned 
to coexist with the multinational energy companies and federal 
regulators 
although state coffers dont gain a cent from drilling outside 
alaskas threemile limit former governors jay hammond and bill 
sheffield as well as cowper all supported ocs leasing except in 
bristol bay 
but alaskas decadeold effort to exclude bristol bay from ocs 
sales was stymied by the reluctance of its own congressional 
delegation to fight exploration and the adamant refusal of 
presidents carter and reagan to exclude the bay from interior 
department leasing 
with nearly unanimous support from environmentalists and 
fishermen alaska turned to the courts for help 
this region is commonly referred to as the golden 
triangle wrote lance trasky of the alaska department of fish 
and game during the lengthy litigation these fish and wildlife 
resources have great social and economic value to the world 
last october us supreme court justice sandra day oconnor 
rejected the states appeal immediately thereafter bids were 
opened and 23 tracts were leased by nine oil companies at an 
average price of 78387 an acre 
shell western eampp and chevron usa the two big winners 
announced plans to begin surveying as early as this summer with 
drilling to follow as soon as permits were obtained 
in a lastditch letter to bush 24 days before the prince william 
sound disaster cowper urged him to defer leasing long enough to 
study environmental impacts of an oil spill in bristol bay 
so far cowper has had no reply from the white house 
alaskas senate added its plea last week unanimously passing a 
resolution urging the federal government to hold up bristol bay 
exploration 
hammond the former governor and a bristol bay resident agrees 
that the politicians and oil companies have been listening to 
alaskans for years but not hearing them 
like many he feels the prince william sound disaster may be 
the death knell to bristol bay leasing because of the nightmarish 
potential if a spill happened here 
but as a battlescarred veteran of two decades of alaskan 
political infighting the man who was governor throughout the 
building of the transalaska pipeline is also a realist 
i am optimistic theres a substantially greater impediment to 
bristol bay leasing today said hammond but i am not 
optimistic it will never be done after all this is alaska 
unhappily dillingham mayor joe mcgill agreed 
i liked living here so much better before electricity taxes 
and lawyers sighed mcgill 
when the oil companies are really ready to do it theyll do 
it hell theyre a lot bigger than a bunch of fishermen and 
money in alaska always talks

no superheroes grace the pages of 
javier juarezs comic books no archvillains with maniacal plots to 
control the world and not a single pow zap or bam 
even so the blackandwhite adventures of felipe and his 
friends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles 
to become legal us residents may be the most dogeared literature 
in california 
distributed free at employment offices churches and social 
service agencies the booklets are lessons in applying for 
residency under the complex 1986 immigration reform and control 
act better known as the amnesty program 
amnistia or amnesty about applying for temporary 
residency was out of print soon after the release of 50000 copies 
a year ago the second phase about permanent residency and 
avoiding disqualification is in its second printing four months 
after distribution of the first 30000 copies 
weve never had this kind of response with any material 
before said emily goldfarb executive director of the san 
franciscobased coalition for immigrant and refugee rights and 
services which produced the books 
the potential audience in california exceeds 158 million the 
number of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program 
all this subject matter is deadly boring if you arent 
affected by it if you are affected by it its not deadly boring 
its terrifyingly boring said juarez 39 a former mexican 
government economist who got the idea after he married a us 
citizen and moved from mexico city to california 
so juarez lightened it up capitalizing on the gallows humor and 
love of storytelling he said is the heritage of mexico where 
political cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soap 
operastyle novellas are popular 
lots of people say why a comic book thats for a kid or the 
mentally retarded theres nothing comic about the situations 
portrayed in the comic books actually its a matter of life and 
death its going to determine where they live and work but 
theres no reason to lose your sense of humor 
when the characters discuss the difficulties of obtaining 
documents and witnesses sworn statements to prove theyve been in 
the country since jan 1 1982 the cutoff date for amnesty 
applications felipe laments even my motherinlaw wanted to 
use the opportunity to get rid of me 
the idea was so good that the immigration and naturalization 
service which had said it couldnt afford to produce juarezs 
book followed suit the government version also proved popular 
said scott nyborn outreach coordinator with the ins in san 
francisco i dont think we have any left actually 
juarez writes the scripts in spanish then translates them for 
english editions a former student of dramatic arts he gets help 
with illustrations from his mediawise family his father works in 
advertising his brother in filmmaking and his sister is a 
television director in mexico 
he strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everyday 
spanish while accurately imparting information about the amnesty 
program a task that can be a nightmare because experts 
frequently disagree on the complex law 
goldfarb believes that unlike with government brochures people 
hang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families 
reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed or 
exploited by swindlers 
theyre fun to read she said the graphics and the 
conversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that people 
can identify with 
amnistia dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program 
but applying for residency is just the first step the application 
dealines were may 5 1988 for aliens here since 1982 and nov 30 
for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops at 
least 90 days between may 1985 and may 1986 
the second phase deals with permanent residency and problems 
like arrests unemployment and welfare dependancy that can make 
applicants ineligible 
two more issues are in the works to address mandated aids tests 
qualifying for government assistance including free and 
reducedprice school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care 
and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of english and 
american civics and history 
if the next issue wins a state grant goldfarb said the 
immigrant and refugee rights coalition plans to print 70000 copies 
for distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in the 
san francisco bay area then make it available to other 
organizations throughout the state to reprint 
juarez said the widespread readership is its own reward and has 
inspired him to try producing as his next project an analytical 
spanishenglish language magazine for californias rapidly growing 
hispanic population

when the supreme court legalized abortion in 
1973 the justices stepped into an intense national debate they 
have continued to shape with a series of important decisions 
in the 16 years since the roe vs wade ruling the court 
generally has reinforced the right to abortion while limiting 
accessibility for minors and women on welfare 
every case since roe has effectively reaffirmed and built on 
it said lynn paltrow a lawyer with the reproductive freedom 
project of the american civil liberties union but she added 
for the most vulnerable women in our society minors and the 
poor the court has limited access to abortion 
the passing years also have seen a dwindling court majority for 
upholding the privacy right to have an abortion that the justices 
established in 1973 
that trend reflecting the courts changing membership is a key 
factor as the justices examine an abortion regulation case from 
missouri they are being asked to use the case to overturn or 
substantially limit the 1973 ruling 
the court will hear arguments on the missouri law wednesday with 
a decision expected by july 
john c willke who heads the national right to life committee 
that opposes abortion rights said erosion of court support for roe 
vs wade reflects more than just the politics of the day the 
concept behind roe vs wade is so shot full of holes that it 
cannot stand much longer he said 
the 1973 decision legalized abortion nationwide for the first 
time the 72 ruling said a womans decision to have an abortion in 
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her 
doctor it said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health but 
that states may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third 
trimester 
marcy wilder of the national abortion rights action league said 
the court could decline to overturn roe vs wade and still do great 
damage to womens access to safe and legal abortions 
if the justices uphold the missouri law she said there will 
be a political firestorm as state legislatures and interest 
groups seek to impose new restrictions on how when where and why 
abortions may be performed 
the restrictions would get more severe and more severe ms 
wilder said the right would become hollow it would be saying 
get an abortion if you can find one 
here is a chronology of the supreme courts other major 
decisions on abortion 
on the same day as the roe vs wade decision jan 22 1973 
the court struck down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities 
that could be used to perform abortions the decision gave rise to 
a new kind of medical facility the abortion clinic 
in 1976 the court by a 63 vote said states cannot give a 
husband veto power over his wifes decision to abort her pregnancy 
by a separate 54 vote the court said parents of minor unwed 
girls cannot have such an absolute veto 
in 1977 the court 63 ruled that states have no legal 
obligation to pay for nontherapeutic abortions 
in 1979 the court voted 63 to reaffirm its intention to give 
doctors broad discretion in determining viability when a 
fetus can live outside the mothers womb 
later than year the court by an 81 vote elaborated on its 
parental consent decision of 1976 it implied that states may be 
able to require an unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an 
abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure 
to parental approval such as letting the minor seek a state 
judges approval instead 
in 1980 the court ruled 54 that the federal government and 
individual states do not have to pay for abortions even medically 
necessary ones for women on welfare 
in 1981 the court ruled by a 63 vote that states may require 
doctors consulted by some young girls to try to inform the parents 
before performing a requested abortion 
in 1983 the court 63 said states and local communities may 
not require all abortions for women more than three months pregnant 
to be performed in a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
in 1986 the court voted 54 to strike down pennsylvania 
abortion regulations requiring doctors to inform women seeking 
abortions about potential risks and about available medical 
assistance benefits for prenatal care and childbirth 
the court also struck down requirements that two doctors always 
be present for abortions performed in the third trimester a rare 
procedure and that such abortions use methods which pose the least 
risk to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb 
in 1987 a 44 split of the justices had the effect of 
invalidating an illinois law that could have made abortions more 
difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the decision was announced two months before justice anthony m 
kennedy joined the court replacing retired justice lewis f powell

cannon greeted the gray dawn at the tip of 
manhattan with a 13gun salute on april 30 1789 signaling the 
start of what one newspaper correspondent called one of the most 
august and interesting spectacles ever exhibited on this globe 
gen george washington was in town to be inaugurated as 
president of the united states it was an event fraught with 
symbolism a new leader of a new country with a new kind of 
government 
these upstart colonial types they were in the forefront of an 
age of experiments in government says richard b bernstein 
historian with the citys commission on the bicentennial of the 
constitution and this ceremonial event was an event not just in 
the countrys history but in human history 
the city is celebrating the inaugurations bicentennial with a 
week of historic reenactments fireworks extravaganzas and 
parades president bush is expected to attend next sunday for the 
recreation of washingtons swearingin 
by 9 am of that historic day the sun was out and by noon the 
crowds packed the dozen blocks from washingtons rented home at 3 
cherry st to federal hall at broad and wall streets more than 
20000 people turned out by some estimates in a city of about 
30000 
im not sure everybody in the city was there but this was an 
event people felt they had to be at this was the launching of the 
government bernstein said 
washington had been elected unanimously in february because he 
was the only true national political figure of his time 
bernstein said 
for those who filled the streets of the city washington 
embodied the hopes and dreams for the new nation 
as madison said the only aspect of the new government the 
people believed in was washington said jt flexner author of 
an acclaimed fourvolume biography of the first president 
that was true even if most people were not sure what washington 
looked like 
there were a certain number of engravings but on the whole 
you had no idea what the guy looked like flexner said but 
automatically he was recognized as a great man he looked so much 
the office 
just by looking at him they knew he was commanderinchief 
it was his dignity and he was a very big man for those days 
about 6foot3 
the crowd finally got its chance to glimpse the man around noon 
when a congressional party arrived at cherry street to fetch him 
washington had dressed carefully a suit of brown broadcloth 
spun in hartford conn had been selected it was a political not 
a fashion statement he wanted to advertise domestic 
manufactures 
more important bernstein said the brown suit proclaimed i 
am a civilian i am george washington esquire i am a citizen of 
the united states of america i am not general george washington 
washingtons hair was powdered the stockings were silk the 
shoe buckles silver as were the suits buttons decorated with 
eagles he put on his hat and strapped on his dress sword and steel 
scabbard 
the people outside the home cheered as he emerged and climbed 
into a special coach pulled by four horses the procession wound 
through town through cheering crowds to the recently remodeled 
federal hall 
the throng filled the streets and every window some had 
scrambled onto roofs 
inside federal hall the doors to the senate chamber swung open 
as washington approached all rose and he bowed to the senators 
and foreign dignitaries on his right and to the representatives on 
his left 
he sat down in front of the central window vice president john 
adams to his right speaker of the house frederick muhlenberg on 
his left it was up to adams to get things started 
william maclay an irreverent pennsylvania senator recalled in 
his diary that in the pressure of the moment adams seemed to 
have forgot half of what he was to say for he made a dead pause and 
stood for some time to appearance in a vacant mood 
adams recovered sir the senate and house of representatives 
are ready to attend you to take the oath required by the 
constitution it will be administered by the chancellor of the 
state of new york 
i am ready to proceed said washington 
then it was out onto the small secondstory porch and into view 
of the crowd which erupted again into cheers washington hand on 
heart bowed repeatedly then sat on an armchair 
dignitaries shuffled onto the small platform a small table 
draped in red held a leatherbound bible resting on a red cushion 
the secretary of the senate samuel a otis picked it up as 
washington rose and moved to the front of the platform where all 
could see 
then quiet 
chancellor robert r livingston faced washington who put his 
hand on the book 
do you solemnly swear that you will faithfully execute the 
office of president of the united states and will to the best of 
your ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the 
united states 
washington repeated the oath adding the words so help me 
god and bowed to kiss the bible 
it is done livingston said then shouted to the crowd 
long live george washington president of the united states 
otis son harrison gray otis remembered the scene decades 
later no one can describe the silent tearful ecstasy which 
pervaded the myriads who witnessed that scene succeeded only by 
shouts which seemed to shake the canopy above them 
washington bowed again as the cheering swelled another 13gun 
salute boomed from the battery while in the harbor a spanish ship 
fired its own salute above it all church bells could be faintly 
heard 
the president walked back inside for his inaugural address to 
congress then it was another procession to st pauls church then 
a quiet dinner then the nights celebration 
in the evening maclay wrote there were grand fire works 
the spanish ambassadors house was adorned with transparent 
paintings the french ministers house was illuminated and had some 
transparent pieces the hall was grandly illuminated and after all 
this the people went to bed

john adams was worried 
the inauguration of george washington was fast approaching and 
the new vice president fretted over where he should sit how 
congress should receive him and how washington should be formally 
addressed 
after all it was a new position in a unique form of government 
writing in his diary sen william maclay of pennsylvania said 
adams worried aloud about washingtons inaugural address how 
shall i behave how shall we receive it shall it be standing or 
sitting 
as for washingtons new title adams perhaps looking ahead to a 
time when he would become president liked the sound of his most 
benign highness 
some senators came up with a designation that was clearly the 
product of a committee his highness the president of the united 
states of america and protector of the rights of the same 
washington would have none of that his friend james madison 
persuaded congress to follow the constitution and simply call him 
the president of the united states 
it reflected his personality not wanting to be called any of 
these fancy things said biographer jt flexner it also 
reflected a very deep problem in peoples minds 
youve got to remember there had been no republican 
government in the entire world and there was always a fear youd 
end up with an american king

george washingtons inaugural address sent no 
chills down spines among the thousands of spectators outside 
federal hall 
they never heard it and congress which he was addressing 
barely heard it 
the leader of the continental army and the symbol of the new 
nation delivered his 20minute speech in a low quavering voice 
that was hard to hear and punctuated with awkward hand gestures 
sen william maclay of pennsylvania who kept a diary thought 
this great man was agitated and embarrassed more than ever he was 
by the levelled cannon or pointed musket 
jt flexner author of a fourvolume biography of the first 
president says washingtons nervousness and diffident manner 
revealed the overwhelming sense of import he was feeling 
the general opinion of the world was that this was a bunch of 
crazy people trying to do the impossible flexner said he had 
tremendous responsibility not only to the people but as president 
to demonstrate that people could rule themselves he felt this 
tremendous responsibility 
washington had abandoned a 73page speech written earlier and 
went with a shorter version that outlined general goals and urged 
congress to avoid local prejudices or attachments and party 
animosities 
the closest thing to news in the speech was his indirect 
endorsement of the bill of rights he asked congress to quickly 
pass amendments showing a reverence for the characteristic rights 
of freemen and a regard for the public harmony 
another reason for the shaky tone of the address was 
washingtons formal manner he was not a politician not an orator 
he was a farmer and a soldier 
he was able to be extremely affable and at the same time 
affable without inviting intimacy flexner said he was shy he 
hated to have his portrait painted hated having people stare at 
him

the middleaged white woman in the david 
duke sweatshirt was pleasantly enthusiastic 
hes for fair play for all she said of the exku klux klan 
leader she had come to hear right now its like weve become the 
minority and we need someone to do something 
duke who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected 
official points to such people as proof his message is becoming 
mainstream now leader of the national association for the 
advancement of white people duke won a seat in the louisiana 
legislature by talking about the high birthrate among unwed welfare 
women and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws 
i think i spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the 
dinner table he said people were so impressed by the ideas 
that they voted for me despite the controversy of my background 
duke is not alone in his thinking much of what he says is 
echoed by those who have opposed him throughout his career 
the david duke election was a signal of a sour mood of 
resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in 
developing said irwin suall director of factfinding for the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith there is a perception out 
there that blacks are being favored at the expense of whites not 
merely in employment but in status in the media 
some dismiss dukes slim 200vote victory as an anomaly his 
suburban new orleans district is 99 percent white but suall and 
other trackers of racial tension believe disparate events like 
dukes election and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture are 
warning signs to be taken seriously 
these people and these events represent something larger 
said chip berlet a researcher for political research associates of 
cambridge mass they are like the canaries in mines telling us 
there is an undercurrent of people that are very unhappy 
this unhappiness says berlet and others runs long and deep it 
is the result of economic changes that have nibbled away at the 
bluecollar union tradition of fear of drugs and crime of the 
perception that civil rights programs like affirmative action are 
unfair to whites and of a general hopelessness within the white 
working class that sees a shrinking of its power in society 
at a shopping mall on the edge of dukes district a white woman 
in her 30s offered her opinion but declined to give her name 
you see all this about black power and black pride and helping 
blacks economically and i guess that started out with good 
intentions but its not right when whites lose jobs and its not 
fair when youre called a racist for complaining about it 
it is difficult to measure this mood most polls show the 
american public far more tolerant of racial differences and 
integration programs than it once was but michael mckeon a 
pollster who has worked with the democratic congressional campaign 
committee said standard surveys that ask yesno questions cant 
plumb the depth of individual attitudes 
mckeon said his phone surveys which involve more dialogue with 
subjects show big time disenchantment 
its nothing you can put a number on but there is a 
resentment out there that the lower middle class and their 
children arent going to be any better off than they were he 
said if you ask are you mad because your kid didnt get a 
scholarship and a black kid did theyre going to say no but if 
you talk to them youre going to see this resentment woven into the 
fabric of their thoughts 
those in the civil rights trenches like curt koehler an 
organizer for the chicago commission on human relations note a 
simmering anger especially among young whites 
a growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on 
the short end of the stick said koehler who tries to defuse 
racial tension in the bluecollar neighborhoods on chicagos 
southwest side an area that has seen klan rallies and violence by 
skinheads 
koehler said the lower middleclass white bastion of the secure 
union job is crumbling at the same time the disenchanted see a 
growing black middle class moving in and believe it is the result 
of favored government treatment 
a black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a 
neighborhood where a young white kid just saw his job leave he 
said the anger is being placed now on black folks and 
affirmative action 
beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride 
the higher profile of minorities on stage film and the television 
screen gives some whites already worried about their status the 
sense that their importance in society is diminishing 
berlet noted that while relatively few blacks appear on tv 
their numbers have increased so rapidly that their representation 
can seem disproportional blacks make up 15 percent of the 
population and maybe only 4 percent on tv he said but when 
some whites see more black faces on televison they think 
theyre taking over 
gregg a 20yearold atlanta skinhead who declined to give his 
last name complained bitterly about what he sees as black 
propaganda 
i was watching television and they had these blacks sitting 
around telling everybody it was blacks who invented this and 
blacks who invented that it was abunch of lies he said 
bert a fellow skinhead sees such concepts as black pride and 
black history coming at the expense of white identity 
white heritage is not being taught in school its like youre 
supposed to be ashamed of being white while theyre teaching black 
heritage full force he said they completely downplay the role 
whites have in this country 
these frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that 
koehler has seen in his chicago neighborhoods or he said 
these people can vote for a david duke in the belief they can 
protect what is mine 
whether or not that translates into the election of more 
candidates with similar ideologies is debated by the pulsetakers of 
society 
martin lipset a stanford university sociologist thinks other 
white rights candidates may be elected to local office but 
theyre dead if they have any ambitions to go further 
duke however believes he is only the first to tap into a 
sentiment that will grow 
i think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see 
candidates discuss these things he said a candidate who 
doesnt have to carry the political baggage i had to carry and who 
discusses these issues will win

for all their vitriol racial hate groups in the 
united states are swimming against a steady tide of public opinion 
while prejudice remains polls show it has been declining steadily 
for years 
groups such as the loosely organized neonazi skinheads who 
were assembling with white supremacists in idaho this weekend 
represent a minuscule minority with no trend in broader opinion 
behind them pollsters said in interviews last week 
you always have kook groups around said tom smith director 
of the longrunning general social survey at the national opinion 
research center i dont see any sign that theyre tapping a vein 
of discontent 
still even as polls track general declines in racism they do 
find lingering prejudice particularly among older whites in the 
rural south and whites overall remain far more sanguine than 
blacks about race relations 
theres no doubt that there is a lot of racism in american 
society smith said to say that we are a racially colorblind 
society is nonsense but to say theres hasnt been enormous 
progress is also misguided 
he pointed for example to support for busing to achieve racial 
balance in public schools thirtyfour percent of american adults 
polled by norc supported busing in 1988 a minority but well up 
from 16 percent in 1976 
similarly while 23 percent said last year that they favored 
laws against interracial marriage that was down from 30 percent in 
1980 other measures from willingness to vote for a black for 
president to acceptance of racial diversity in schools and 
neighborhoods also show increasing tolerance 
pollsters note however that expressions of tolerance can be 
misleading while most whites say they would vote for a qualified 
black for president for example most also say no black has such 
qualifications now 
generally the trend has been helpful a lot of folks out there 
think racism is wrong and would like to believe its a problem 
thats going behind us said steve ralston deputy director of 
the naacp legal defense and educational fund but blacks still 
feel the effects of racism very much 
in a recent harris poll for example 70 percent of whites said 
most blacks received equal pay for equal work while only 40 
percent of blacks agreed in a media generalassociated press poll 
57 percent of whites said blacks and other minorities had the same 
opportunities as whites but only 28 percent of blacks agreed 
across the board whites think blacks are treated better than 
blacks think blacks are treated said ron bass a pollster for 
louis harris and associates whites think blacks have made a lot 
of progress in terms of attaining equality blacks dont feel that 
way at all 
polls however do not support the thesis that white americans 
are growing disenchanted with government efforts to address past 
discrimination while such programs have never been broadly 
popular said smith support for them has held steady or increased 
not declined 
in norc polls for instance support for more spending on 
improving the conditions of blacks rose from 26 percent in 1978 
to 38 percent a decade later while those who wanted less money 
committed to the effort fell from 27 percent to 17 percent the 
bulk each year said spending was about right 
questions on affirmative action are among the most sensitive 
because of a resistance among americans to the perception of 
preferential treatment for any group smith said a harris poll 
asking if respondents favored affirmative action programs in 
employment for blacks provided there are no rigid quotas found 
74 percent in support but the same question using different 
language in a media generalassociated press poll should blacks 
and other minorities receive preference in hiring to make up for 
past inequalities found 79 percent opposed 
nevertheless when the question has been asked over time smith 
said polls have not found any growing opposition to affirmative 
action 
even with the poll results ralston of the naacp legal defense 
and educational fund said he was concerned about anecdotal reports 
that could indicate increased racial intolerance ranging from 
racially divided voting in chicagos mayoral election to the 1986 
racial attack in the howard beach neighborhood of new york city 
gauging from the sentiments in surveys the trend is in the 
right direction ralston said but weve got a ways to go yet

the red brick apartment house just south of 
the sunset strip is so handsomely crafted and so venerable by 
california standards it has been designated a national monument so 
has the lady on the fourth floor 
bette davis has been accorded almost every honor possible for a 
film actress two academy awards the american film institute and 
kennedy center awards for lifetime achievement and more one has 
been missing and that will be corrected april 24 when she is 
honored by the film society of lincoln center 
this is sort of the last big one i havent received and im 
very pleased it took me a long time to receive the kennedy center 
so i say better late than never i must say ive never gotten 
blase about honors its great its wonderful she said 
the apartment is spacious yet bears little evidence of her 
studio years the exception is a large painting of davis around 
1950 when she made all about eve the room was fragrant with 
floral bouquets sent for her 81st birthday april 5 it was a 
wonderful family day lots of flowers lots of calls she said 
the actress looked stylish in a black top and black skirt filled 
with yellow daisies half a lifetime after the portrait on the 
wall her face shows evidence of severe illness yet her ashblonde 
hair is as lovely as ever and she retains a regal beauty the 
voice still crackles with nononsense authority and she still 
unapologetically smokes cigarettes 
in a recent interview she sat in an easy chair leaning against 
a small pillow bearing the legend in needlepoint no guts no 
glory is that a davis motto 
oh yes totally she declared its the truth to dare to 
be hated that takes guts 
her recent history has borne out her credo she survived a 
mastectomy and a disfiguring stroke she weathered an attack by 
daughter bd hyman in the 1985 book my mothers keeper 
davis own book this n that 1987 was rejected by a 
publisher but she advertised it in publishers weekly found 
another publisher and had a best seller 
last year she left wicked stepmother in the middle of 
filming to have dental work in new york claiming differences with 
the director she didnt return and the thriller was finished 
without her 
she shrugs off such matters and talks more positively about 
other things such as the miracle year of 1939 the greatest 
outpouring of movie classics in hollywood history astonishingly 
she starred in four memorable films that year dark victory 
juarez the private lives of elizabeth and essex and the 
old maid 
this is also the golden anniversary of gone with the wind 
the wizard of oz wuthering heights stagecoach and 
mr smith goes to washington why such a creative explosion 
i dont know davis said i did about 10 films in a row 
starting in 1939 and i was pretty tired when it was all over but 
that series of films made this career permanent many of them were 
based on great plays there are no plays anymore todays films 
are about diseases and nonfiction 
ill feel very happy too that i was a blackandwhiteera 
woman oh yes it gave you so much more variety color is so 
pretty 
they wanted to make whatever happened to baby jane in 
color i said i wont make it if its in color i couldnt 
possibly have worn the makeup in color the shadows and the 
lights and all of those great cameramen like ernie haller i 
happened to see all this and heaven too the other night ah i 
was a lucky woman the women of today dont have such cameramen i 
dont think people care anymore 
is she appalled by the coloring of film classics 
its worse than appalled its heartbroken i saw dark 
victory in color the bright pink blouse and the bright blue 
skirt and all the faces and the sets are pink so all the good 
taste of the set people the wardrobe people the actors is 
ruined 
she was born ruth elizabeth davis in lowell mass and like 
katharine hepburn her life has been instilled with yankee 
indomitability after minor stage work she landed in hollywood 
with a universal contract making her film debut in 1931 with bad 
sister she was fired for having as much sex appeal as slim 
summerville the studios tall skinny comic 
the young actress was headed back to the stage when an offer 
came from warner bros the studio used her for leg art and ingenue 
roles until she was loaned to rko for of human bondage in 1934 
her portrayal of the slatternly waitress was galvanizing her first 
oscar came the next year for an inconsequential film 
dangerous consolation prize for losing in 1934 she won again 
for jezebel in 1939 
jack warner realized he had a major star and davis roles 
became more formidable but she was dissatisfied with how she was 
treated and she tried to break her contract by fleeing to england 
warner won a suit to force her return 
jack was gracious afterward she recalled if you lose a 
case you have to pay both lawyers fees he did not make me pay 
his lawyers he was very very good when i came home i got better 
directors better scripts 
she remained at warners for 18 years leaving after the 
disastrous beyond the forest in 1949 her next movie was all 
about eve another of her 10 academy nominations she has 
continued working in films television and lectures always in the 
patented davis style and despite tragedy 
personal disasters have not prompted davis to abandon her 
65year passion for acting her greatest hope is to make a film on 
the life of the late beauty tycoon helena rubinstein ive got a 
good script and ill do it she said with customary resolve 
she also would like to resume the bette davis show a 
traveling act featuring exchanges between the star and the audience 
and clips of her movies she recalled her favorite story 
i was appearing for three nights at the palladium in london a 
woman at the back of the theater screamed at me miss davis have 
you had your face lifted 
i got down on my knees in back of the footlights and said 
come here this poor woman and the whole audience was worried 
she didnt know whether i was going to punch her or say god damn 
you or what so i faced her over the footlights and said if i 
had wouldnt i look a lot better 
she gave the hearty bette davis laugh blinked those bette davis 
eys and lighted another cigarette

when an ashblonde with bright saucer eyes told 
a wimpy richard barthelmess id love to kiss yuh but i jest 
washed ma hayer in 1932s cabin in the cotton the world 
knew there could be only one bette davis 
in the scores of movies that followed she created memorable 
roles and delivered deathless lines in her clipped hardedged 
voice 
she was ruthless as the slutty mildred in 1934s of human 
bondage tearing the gentle leslie howard to shreds 
you cad you dirty swine i never cared for you not once i 
was always making a fool of you you bored me stiff i hated you 
it made me sick when i had to let you kiss me i only did it 
because you begged me you hounded me you drove me crazy and 
after you kissed me i always used to wipe my mouth wipe my mouth 
but i made up for it for every kiss i had to laugh 
as a husbandkiller in bordertown 1934 she rails about 
her boredom the only fun i get is feeding the goldfish and they 
only eat once a day 
davis characters were rarely made for small towns and the slow 
lane they dreamed big at any cost 
if i dont get out of here ill just die living here is like 
waiting for the funeral to begin no its like waiting in the 
coffin for them to carry you out she laments in beyond the 
forest 1949 
and in the same movie she says what a dump 
the offrepeated line is usually applied with venom but thats 
not the way the actress played it in the movie 
that has nothing to do with me she said in an interview 
that is completely mr edward albee and elizabeth taylor 
playwright and star of the film whos afraid of virginia 
woolf i made nothing of it i walked up to a table dusted it 
and said what a dump you hardly hear me say it 
her passions do flare when her characters turn to crime 
in bordertown she tells paul muni her sleazy lawyerlover 
i made you rich i put those swell clothes on your back now 
just because you got your neck washed you think youre a 
gentleman no one can make you that youre riffraff and so am i 
you belong to me and youll stay with me you bet youre going to 
stay with me because im holding on to you why i committed murder 
to get you 
later in 1940s the letter davis kills her lover and 
unflinchingly tells her husband with all my heart i still love 
the man i killed 
but there was another davis screen image a gentle almost naive 
girlishness 
now voyager was a triplehanky treat with paul henreid as 
the object of her doomed love affair who will ever forget henreid 
with a smoky sexy glance lighting two cigarettes and giving davis 
one 
oh im such a fool such an old fool these are only tears 
of gratitude an old maids gratitude for the crumbs offered 
you see no one ever called me darling before she tells him 
and when she accepts death in dark victory she turns to 
george brent nothing can hurt us now what we have cant be 
destroyed thats our victory our victory over the dark it is a 
victory because were not afraid 
as she matured davis lines especially those regarding women 
relationships and love became more philosophical but still had an 
acerbic wit 
there comes a time in every womans life when the only thing 
that helps is a glass of champagne old acquaintance 1943 
oh its incredible utterly incredible perched up on that 
pinnacle of masculine ego looking down at poor weak defenseless 
females and pitying them because they dont have beards 
june bride 1948 
funny business a womans career the things you drop on 
your way up the ladder so you can move faster you forget youll 
need them again when you go back to being a woman thats one 
career all females have in common whether we like it or not being 
a woman sooner or later weve got to work at it and in the 
last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up or turn 
around in bed and there he is without that youre not a woman 
youre something with a french provincial office or a book full of 
clippings but youre not a woman all about eve 1950 
joseph l mankiewicz all about eve was one of the wittiest 
and most literate movies ever to roll out of hollywood it had a 
champagnecast that included anne baxter thelma ritter marilyn 
monroe and george sanders as the viperish theater critic addison 
dewitt 
davis as the aging actress margo channing was even more 
clipped in her delivery 
to ruthless ingenue eve harrington after accepting a 
prestigious drama award and telling the audience that her heart 
will always be in the theater nice speech eve but i wouldnt 
worry too much about your heart you can always put that award 
where your heart ought to be 
to her housekeeper birdie after learning eve has tried to 
steal her boyfriend fasten your seat belts its going to be a 
bumpy night 
davis doesnt think of the famous line as being a showstopper 
its just a wonderful line you have as the character she said 
flying into australia one time i was invited into the cockpit 
to look out and see the harbor and all on cue as i went through 
the door the fasten your seat belts sign came on and the entire 
plane load absolutely died laughing it was just as if we had 
planned it

i love you madly 
duke ellington to his audience at every perfomance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
his mistress was music and his passion jazz and 
his genius was the ability to easily execute his ideas whether 
with a full orchestra or a mere piano 
edward kennedy duke ellington was one of the greatest 
american composers of the 20th century a band leader arranger and 
pianist who helped hone jazz into a fine art for half a century he 
would have been 90 on april 29 and friends family and fans are 
commemorating the anniversary of his birth with concerts and 
remembrances 
his son mercer who now leads the celebrated ellington band 
says his father would have been especially delighted about being 
honored in washington dc his home town 
mercer will lead celebrations in both washington and new york 
where his father and his band became famous at the cotton club 
starting in 1927 duke remained in new york and perfected his 
compositions he died there at age 75 on may 24 1974 
on april 27 mercer will participate in a symposium at the 
smithsonian institution and lay a cornerstone the house where duke 
ellington was born has been torn down when the developer was told 
the significance of the site he named his new structure the duke 
ellington building 
on april 28 the ellington band will play at the beacon theater 
in new york the first half will be a drum is a woman 
choreographed by mercedes ellington the oldest of mercers four 
children she danced in no no nanette and sophisticated 
ladies a musical of duke ellington tunes on broadway and now 
heads her own company dancellington the anne swain clark singers 
also will participate 
a drum is a woman an allegorical history of jazz was first 
performed on the us steel hour on cbstv in 1957 with talley 
beatty dancing the part of caribee joe opposite carmen de lavallade 
as mme zzaj jazz spelled backwards duke narrated 
that was a project he and orson welles had mercer said 
orson put him on a fabulous salary and they would party like mad 
dogs the boss asked where is the music orson got fired a 
drum is a woman was some of the work from that project it was 
made into a record album and from the album it went onto tv 
they also will perform ansellia a black orchid which 
mercer composed for mercedes when she was 7 
the band returns to washington for a parade across the duke 
ellington bridge on april 29 and a concert at the smithsonian the 
smithsonian will also have showings of paris blues and 
anatomy of a murder and a monthlong exhibit of ellington 
memorabilia and the art of gaye ellington his granddaughter 
on april 30 the band will squeeze into the cates restaurant and 
jazz club in washington theyll have to play from memory mercer 
said because the club is too small to hold bandstands as well as 
the musicians 
the ellington band has released a new musicmasters recording 
music is my mistress taken from the title of ellingtons 1973 
autobiography its a followup to digital duke on grp records 
which won a grammy in 1988 musicmasters also has a new four 
symphonic works by duke ellington which are harle black 
brown and beige new world a comin and three black 
kings by the american composers orchestra conducted by maurice 
peress 
mercer a graduate of the juilliard school has lived through 
the traumas of growing up the son of a famous father hes now 
secure as the keeper of the flame and is freer to be himself 
im not fending off anything anymore if you can wind up being 
as close to him as possible youre still going to be different and 
your own person he said 
mercers bestknown composition is things aint what they used 
to be 
when i go to write music im sometimes surprised they come 
off close to what dukes sound would have been he said that 
comes from the hours i spent doing his copying i absorbed 
different things and didnt realize it ive been going through the 
music for the smithsonian which has the duke ellington archives 
and i understand it better now than i did then 
for instance i was going through the numbers he wrote for 
jump for joy i got it bad and that aint good brownskinned 
gal in the calico gown chocolate shake i saw the entracte 
giddy bug gallop i realized this was something too amazing even 
to hope to understand when i first heard it now i know what it is 
we the band are getting ready to do it ourselves 
jump for joy played to soldout houses in los angeles in 
1941 but never moved to broadway in certain quarters it wasnt 
too popular mercer said it was blatantly against racial 
prejudice there were threats to bomb the theater 
queenie pie an opera ellington composed for television but 
was never broadcast has been produced in philadelphia and 
washington and is slated for broadway next fall starring patti 
labelle queenie pie reggae including steel drums is on the 
new album 
duke wrote the reggae he didnt jump into a fad but he always 
touched on it mercer said hed make sure he wasnt left out 
not having a say about what was happening black swan was a 
disguised form of take the a train as a chacha he took creole 
love call and made it rock n roll and called it neocreole he 
wrote octaclock rock after harold ashby got in the band 
from his first hit in 1930 mood indigo duke ellington 
wrote and composed thousands of works including popular songs 
suites tone poems and three song cycles meant to be sung as sacred 
concerts 
the sacred concerts were sincere mercer said it was also 
another way for him to really be intelligent and get away with it 
modern religious music is open enough to allow newer thoughts 
he has done things with music which is not necessarily jazz 
as his friend bob bach the late tv producer said duke is beyond 
category

the question is always more enticing than the 
reply because there is only one right answer for a vice president 
and dan quayle gave it 
no quayle said he would not disclose the issues on which 
he had differed with president bush sorry 
vice presidents who did otherwise have been sorrier spiro t 
agnew came quickly to regret the misgivings he expressed about the 
first gestures in what became president richard m nixons opening 
to china hubert h humphrey had to back off his own effort to 
chart an independent and slightly different vietnam policy during 
the 1968 presidential campaign 
harmony is the vice presidential rule and the president picks 
the tunes 
im not going to get into private conversations that i have 
with the president what kind of influence and how i think i can 
influence his decisions quayle told the american society of 
newspaper editors it wouldnt be appropriate and ive decided 
not to do it and if i did engage in it i would lose my 
effectiveness 
so im just not going to enter into that kind of discussion 
thats right out of the vice presidential textbook according to 
bush who kept his own counsel for eight years as no 2 to ronald 
reagan he joined the ticket in 1980 as a defeated reagan rival for 
the presidential nomination he was not a popular choice among many 
of reagans conservative allies 
so there was a premium on loyalty from the start and bush 
delivered it paid double dividends as bush became reagans 
political heir and sometimes took shelter from potentially 
embarrassing questions in the vows of privacy and silence he said 
his job demanded 
quayle by contrast came to the bush ticket as a rookie in 
national politics got a faltering start and still is working to 
shake the lightweight image shaped by his detractors not all of 
whom are democrats 
thats no easy task in a job nelson a rockefeller described as 
standby equipment the prescribed duties are largely 
ceremonial quayle jokes that bush offered to designate him funeral 
czar since the vice president often gets the duty when foreign 
leaders die 
the president has done a lot more than that to help the vice 
president prove himself bush has given quayle a white house role 
much like his own he sent the vice president on the first foreign 
assignment of the new administration to latin america and quayle 
is about to begin a 10day mission to australia and southeast asia 
they have shared platforms and sometimes audiences in onetwo 
appearances that are unusual for presidents and vice presidents 
bush and quayle both will address the members of the associated 
press in separate appearances in chicago on monday the president 
is to speak at the ap annual meeting the vice president two hours 
later at the annual luncheon of the news cooperative 
both will answer questions as they did two days apart at the 
washington meeting of the american society of newspaper editors 
quayle heads a revitalized national space council a vice 
presidential assignment dating back to the time when john f 
kennedy couldnt figure out what to do with lyndon b johnson 
he also will run a new council on competitiveness which will 
seek ways to improve the us position in world trade 
perhaps most important bush has given quayle a daily white 
house role much like his own i meet with the president every 
morning quayle said i have the right to go into his office 
any time i want to i can have a oneonone meeting any time i 
have them periodically 
i have a weekly scheduled luncheon where the president and i 
sit down and have 60 minutes together to go over various things 
what do we discuss we discuss everything i inject my 
opinions my ideas to him so its not just one area thats 
carved out for myself there are various things 
quayle said all of that is on the model of the bush vice 
presidency 
now obviously im a different individual than president bush 
and obviously in a period of time you will have the quayle model of 
the vice presidency he said 
were just starting

bailout and reform bill for the savings and loan industry after 
toughening provisions that would require sampl owners to put more of 
their own money at risk to stay in business

months after president bush called for emergency legislation to 
stop the hemorrhaging of the federal sampl insurance fund from the 
failure of 500 thrifts more than 200 of them in 1988 and another 
350 at or near insolvency

drexel burnham lambert incs decision to sell 
its retail brokerage operation could save the firm the 
embarrassment of losing its securities licenses in dozens of 
states a securities regulator says 
in addition wall street sources said wednesday that drexel is 
requiring bidders for the brokerage to promise they wont hire any 
of the units 1100 brokers for one year if a bidders deal falls 
through 
the move to abandon the retail brokerage which has been part of 
the firm for nearly all of its 157 years followed drexels 
settlement last week of civil fraud charges with the securities and 
exchange commission 
drexel has contacted securities officials in all 50 states to 
prepare for a wave of litigation expected to follow the pact and 
the firms pending guilty plea and 650 million settlement of 
felony charges with the manhattan us attorneys office 
most states bar securities trading by anyone convicted of or 
admitting to a felony or facing an sec injunction said susan 
bryant who heads a panel of state regulators monitoring the drexel 
case the states are expected to try to revoke drexels state 
securities licenses 
but bryant said that by dumping its retail division which has 
43 offices in 19 states the district of columbia and puerto rico 
drexel may eliminate some state civil action to strip its trading 
licenses 
in most states the focus is on the need to protect the 
consumer so the negotiations with drexel may actually change a 
little bit said bryant oklahomas securities administrator 
the things that might have been required to protect the consumer 
may not be necessary 
one firm said wednesday it refused to join the bidding for the 
brokerage operation because of the strict terms being applied by 
drexel which announced the proposed sale tuesday as part of a 
major restructuring amid negative publicity following two major 
securities fraud settlements 
drexel said it contacted about eight firms about buying the 
division but three shearson lehman hutton inc dean witter 
reynolds inc and bear stearns amp co said theyre not interested 
we declined because we questioned the appropriateness of this 
auction process for a financial services company where clients and 
professionals are the key assets dean witter said in a statement 
drexel is forcing any firm that wants to examine the retail unit 
to sign a letter stating it wont directly or indirectly solicit 
the services of anyone in the division for one year said a wall 
street source who declined further identification 
firms that submit to the pact can review a package of 
information provided by drexel today and friday and must submit a 
bid by saturday the source said analysts have placed the value of 
the department at 50 million to 200 million 
the requirement is designed to block other firms from raiding 
drexels 1100 brokers many of whom vented their anger at drexel 
chief executive frederick h joseph during a session on the firms 
internal communications system after the announcement 
drexel spokesman steven anreder denied that there was a oneyear 
moratorium on hiring drexel brokers but refused to provide further 
details on the agreements he said four or five firms have agreed 
to the bidding conditions 
officials at other firms said many drexel brokers had contacted 
them looking for jobs before the announcement and several firms 
were reported wednesday to be negotiating with brokers 
putting them up on the auction block with no firm bidder 
disclosed gives them great incentive to pursue their individual 
fortunes one wall street executive said probably as we speak 
theres some very active cherrypicking going on 
drexels retail unit accounts for about 10 percent of the 
private firms business at its peak the department had 1300 
brokers but drexel didnt replace defectors or retirees because of 
the october 1987 stock market crash and the government probes a 
drexel spokesman said 
drexel said it also is abandoning its business in municipal 
securities overthecounter stocks and research and transactions 
in foreign securities the restructuring will cut drexels 
9100member work force by about a third 
a deal to buy the brokerage would include drexels retail 
offices stockbrokers and presumably the accounts that go with 
them drexel has not said whether it will lay off the 1200member 
support staff in the unit

a legal tactic drexel burnham lambert inc used 
to battle civil securities fraud charges last year has come back to 
haunt the investment giant and delay final settlement of the case 
on wednesday a federal appeals court refused to modify a stay 
originally requested by drexel that temporarily bars lower court 
approval of the deal to settle the biggest securities fraud case in 
history 
the unanimous threejudge appeals panel ruling prevents us 
district judge milton pollack whom drexel unsuccessfully tried to 
disqualify from approving last weeks settlement between drexel 
and the securities and exchange commission 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruling also cast a shadow 
over a final resolution of criminal charges against drexel the 
fifthlargest investment firm in the nation 
the plea bargain drexel struck last december with federal 
prosecutors in the criminal case requiring the firm to plead 
guilty to six felony counts and pay a record 650 million in 
penalties and fines is contingent on the sec settlement 
in washington sec solicitor paul gonson said we are 
disappointed with the court of appeals declining to permit the 
lower court to enter this consent decree which we feel is in the 
public interest 
gonson who oversees sec appeals said the commission has 
decided to take further judicial action possibly as soon as 
today although he declined to give details 
deborah corley a spokeswoman for us attorney benito romano 
said the manhattan federal prosecutors office would have no 
comment on the ruling 
sources close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it was unclear whether the 2nd circuit decision prohibited the 
sec and drexel from seeking a different district judges approval 
if it did bar such an alternative final approval of the settlement 
could be delayed for months they said 
the secs sweeping civil action last september accused drexel 
its former junk bond chief michael milken his brother lowell 
and others of insider trading and other securities violations 
but drexel battled to get pollack to excuse himself from the 
case for an alleged conflict of interest 
drexel lawyers maintained that pollack should be disqualified 
because his wife stood to make millions from a leveraged buyout 
that drexel had helped to finance 
pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd circuit 
which stayed further district court proceedings pending its 
decision upheld pollack in november 
drexel eventually gave up its objections to pollack but the stay 
was extended when the milkens and other defendants sought to argue 
the issue before the us sumpreme court 
the supreme court has not decided whether it will hear the 
appeal 
last week drexel and the sec moved to modify the stay to allow 
pollack to rule on the settlement claiming it was in the public 
interest and important to the protection of investors for the 
deal to go into effect 
gary lynch the secs director of enforcement said the drexel 
deal was one of the most important cases ever brought and to 
delay its implementation would delay payment of 350 million into a 
fund to compensate investors hurt by drexels illegal activities 
assistant us attorney bruce baird made it even plainer to the 
2nd circuit saying additional delay could cause the fiveyear 
statute of limitations to bar prosecutions stemming from the 
drexel probe 
but the 2nd circuit said allowing pollack to consider and 
possibly to approve this settlement would be to allow a change in 
the status quo as it concerns the interests of michael and lowell 
milken before the supreme court has disposed of the case 
as part of its settlements with both the sec and the us 
attorneys office in manhattan drexel is required to fire michael 
milken and suspend his brother and not engage in business 
transactions with either man 
the milkens who were not part of either settlement were named 
earlier this month in a massive federal racketeering indictment 
seeking more than 18 billion in forfeitures the milkens have 
pleaded innocent

a proposed ban on most forms of dual trading 
extensive background checks of new members and expansion of 
disciplinary committees are proof that the chicago mercantile 
exchange wants to preserve integrity officials said 
we said there would be no sacred cows and there were none 
said susan phillips former chairman of the commodity futures 
trading commission and a member of the mercs special committee to 
review trading practices 
committee chairman john geldermann said the urgency of 
wednesdays recommendations was necessary to maintain investor 
confidence since disclosure three months ago of a federal 
investigation into suspected fraud at the merc and the chicago 
board of trade 
dual trading allowed by virtually every financial exchange 
enables a trader to trade his own account at the same time he 
handles customers accounts 
many consider the practice susceptible to abuse because it 
allows unscrupulous traders to allocate profitable deals to their 
own accounts and dump losing trades on customers 
proponents of dual trading argue that the practice increases 
liquidity because traders can continue doing business when they 
dont have outside orders 
but the merc committee with few exceptions recommended that 
dual trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market 
volume is great enough to ensure liquidity 
the committee also recommended 
more extensive screening of membership applicants 
that members of a broker association should not be allowed to 
execute personal trades against orders by members of the broker 
group 
the addition of one nonmerc member to all major disciplinary 
committees the criticism is that were too clubby said merc 
policy chief leo melamed this would enable the public to view 
the process and see we are openhanded 
daily computerized trade information for members covering all 
activity from the previous day 
the panel also recommended the mercs fulltime floor 
surveillance team be doubled to eight staff members 
the recommendations will be submitted to the mercs board of 
governors and a decision is expected within 60 days 
the outside members of the committee felt that the chicago 
mercantile exchange has acted in good faith in enforcing its 
existing rules and procedures and tightening them when 
necessary said ms phillips a vice president at the university 
of iowa 
but the rules and procedures have not kept pace with the rapid 
expansion of new products and trading volume during the past few 
years she said 
melamed said many of the recommendations contained in the report 
were under consideration earlier 
but the time frame was compressed as a result of the federal 
investigation he said 
merc officials appointed the ninemember committee in late 
january 
some observers viewed the committee as part of the futures 
industrys effort to hold the line against further government 
regulations 
the fbi investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100 
brokers at the worlds two largest futures exchanges may have 
systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through 
illegal trading practices 
no indictments have been handed down yet but as many as 200 
subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the 
exchanges published reports have said fbi agents posing as traders 
at the merc and board of trade secretly recorded conversations in 
the pits

gte corp and the home shopping network 
have exchanged another round of barbs as they prepare for a court 
battle over a 15 billion damages lawsuit 
on wednesday the day gte held its annual meeting the home 
shopping network announced that it had filed a complaint on april 
10 against the telephone giant with the securities and exchange 
commission 
the letter accused gte of failing to fully disclose the 
potential threat it faces from the 15 billion lawsuit filed 
against it by hsn 
gte vice president edward c schmults issued a release at the 
annual meeting that labeled the complaint as totally unfounded 
home shoppings lawsuit in florida state court contends gte had 
provided it poor telephone equipment as a result hsn claims it 
lost thousands of customers in addition the lawsuit claims gte 
knew its equipment was inadequate and fraudulently kept the 
information secret from hsn 
home shopping network is distributed nationally on cable 
networks it offers merchandise for sale which viewers can 
purchase by calling telephone numbers displayed on television 
screens 
gte has denied any wrongdoing in its past dealings with hsn it 
also has filed a countersuit charging hsn with business libel and 
slander 
responding to hsns latest claim schmults said it is obvious 
that this latest hsn action is just another unconscionable example 
of hsns attempting to litigate the case outside the courtroom and 
unfairly influence prospective jurors 
a trial is expected to start on june 5 at a court in clearwater 
fla where hsn is based 
in the lawsuit hsn is seeking 500 million in actual damages 
and 1 billion in punitive damages 
fernando difilippo hsn general counsel dismissed schmults 
comments as gtes standard public relations response 
instead of responding that our allegations are unfounded they 
ought to go back and review them he said 
the battle of words on the lawsuit overshadowed other business 
at gtes annual meeting the gathering was the first to be presided 
over by james l johnson who was named chairman and chief 
executive officer one year ago 
as most of you are aware the financial results were excellent 
for us johnson said of 1988 we made further progress in the 
continuing the efforts to enhance our long term profits 
the company reported a record income of 12 billion in 1988 
95 percent higher than 1987 the company also had record revenues 
of 165 billion 67 percent higher than the 154 billion logged 
in 1987 
on tuesday the company reported a firstquarter income of 329 
million on sales totaling 41 billion earnings and revenue both 
were up 15 percent compared to the 1988 figures 
in response to a shareholder question johnson defended gtes 
decision last july to sell a 301 percent interest in us sprint to 
united telecommunications inc for 585 million us sprint is a 
longdistance telephone service formed in 1986 by gte and united 
telecommunications 
it was a winwin situation they won we won we think it was 
a good decision johnson said 
gte which still holds a 199 percent share of us sprint lost 
15 billion in developing the network said charles r lee 
president and chief operating officer gte intends to eventually 
sell the rest of its sprint ownership he said 
gte based in stamford provides telephone service to 31 states 
canada and the dominican republic gte also is a major military 
telephone contractor ringing up more than 2 billion worth of 
defense department contracts in 1988

coleco industries inc says it favors its own 
reorganization plan despite hasbro incs announcement of an 
agreement with a group of colecos unsecured creditors to seek to 
acquire most of the financially troubled toymaker 
hasbro said wednesday it would seek permission from a federal 
bankruptcy court judge to file a joint reorganization plan for 
avonbased coleco which earlier this month announced an amended 
reorganization plan it hoped would satisfy its unsecured creditors 
in a statement wednesday coleco said the hasbro proposal 
appears to be less favorable than the amended reorganization 
plan coleco proposed april 6 
under hasbros proposal the rhode islandbased toymaker would 
purchase colecos assets by giving coleco 85 million in cash and a 
warrant worth an estimated 5 million to acquire 1 million shares 
of hasbros stock over the next four years said john t oneill 
hasbros chief financial officer a warrant offers the right to buy 
stock at a certain price 
oneill said hasbro is looking to acquire property rights and 
some of colecos inventory but that the final determination of what 
hasbro will assume would be detailed in the reorganization plan 
coleco said it has been developing the amended plan with a 
substantial group of unsecured creditors for several weeks and 
that coleco management believes it will be of greater benefit to 
all creditors and shareholders than the hasbro proposal 
on april 6 coleco said that under the amended plan unsecured 
creditors who are owed more than 400 million would receive stock 
in the company giving them about 37 percent of coleco 
coleco chairman morton e handel also said at the time that the 
unsecured creditors would receive other securities cash notes and 
debt instruments worth about 40 million the amendment also called 
for secured creditors to convert their current claim of about 80 
million into coleco common stock giving them 60 percent ownership 
the coleco board of directors called that plan a substantial 
improvement for the unsecured creditors over a plan filed in 
january which unsecured creditors said did not offer them enough 
once one of the nations largest toymakers coleco filed for 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws in july 1988 and in february announced it was 
considering selling the company 
at the same time as it announced its amended reorganization 
plan coleco said it had dropped plans of a sale it reaffirmed 
wednesday that it wants to remain independent 
barry j alperin an executive vice president at hasbro said 
hasbro indicated its interest in buying coleco when coleco 
announced it was exploring a sale 
we were disappointed that coleco failed to follow that course 
of action but are pleased to be working with the unsecured 
creditors committee to seek the permission of the bankruptcy court 
to acquire the company alperin said 
oneill said a petition asking the bankruptcy court for 
permission to file a joint reorganization plan would probably be 
filed thursday if it is accepted hasbro officials hope to 
complete the acquisition by the end of july he said

takeover specialist t boone pickens now the 
largest shareholder in a major japanese auto parts maker failed 
thursday in his bid for an immediate seat on its board the company 
president said 
in a meeting with president takao matsuura and other officers of 
koito manufacturing co pickens outlined his desire to participate 
in the management of the company and requested a seat on the board 
but company officials declined to give him an immediate answer 
matsuura told reporters 
it is necessary to build a trusting relationship first in 
japan it is not possible to just say im a major shareholder 
and get a seat on the board right away said koito director 
tamotsu aoyama 
koito officials are discussing whether to offer pickens a board 
seat 
we dont necessarily understand his interest in managing our 
company aoyama said mr pickens is known for his 
qualifications in the oil business and in corporate buyouts not in 
manufacturing 
in a speech in tokyo wednesday pickens argued that companies 
should be responsible first to their shareholders and only 
secondarily to their management and employees an idea that flies 
in the face of japanese business culture 
pickens holds a 202 percent stake in koito which makes 
headlights and other parts for toyota motor co toyota owns 191 
percent of the company 
pickens also has denied he is interested in greenmail the 
practice of seeking profits by buying up a companys shares until a 
friendly shareholder steps in to buy them back at a premium 
koito and toyota its previous largest shareholder had been the 
victim of greenmail attempts by azabu motor the auto retailer and 
investment company from which pickens bought his koito stake 
analysts said 
pickens assured koitos managment that he intended to be a 
longterm shareholder and was not merely speculating company 
officials said 
matsuura said pickens was welcome to buy more shares if he 
intends to be a stable shareholder which in japan means one 
interested primarily in maintaining a business relationship rather 
than reaping dividends or capital gains and who doesnt sell even 
when the share price drops

among refined products traded on the exchange wednesday the may 
contract for unleaded gasoline rose 076 cent to 7462 cents a 
gallon while heating oil for may delivery increased 057 cent to 
5333 cents a gallon 
the american petroleum institute meanwhile released its 
monthly report showing that domestic production in march totaled 
765 million barrels a day down 82 percent or 690000 barrels 
per day from the yearago level 
us production had not been that low since 1964 when it 
averaged 7614 million barrels a day said ron planting an api 
senior analyst in washington 
the api which represents major oil producers and refiners 
attributed the drop to the march 24 alaskan oil spill and to 
declining production in other major us oilfields the spill last 
month temporarily shut down critical oil shipping lanes into the 
lower united states 
although the unusually large decline reflected in part 
developments related to the tanker grounding near valdez almost 
300000 barrels per day of the 690000 barreladay decrease was 
accounted for by falling production in the lower 48 a decline that 
has continued now for three years the api report said 
planting noted that while problems in alaska oil fields are 
temporary whats happening in the lower 48 is not 
analysts said that despite the recent rise in crude prices it 
will take time for the united states to increase production and 
the alaskan spill will delay congressional permission for major oil 
companies to begin drilling in the protected arctic national 
wildlife refuge which is believed to hold huge reserves of oil and 
natural gas 
tahmassebi said many in and out of the industry are questioning 
the reason for the north sea accidents 
is this happening because of low oil prices and companies 
cutting back on maintenance to keep up profitability he said 
if so these types of things will continue happening 
analysts said the market also got a boost from a weekly api 
report released after the close of trading tuesday that showed 
crude oil stocks fell by 57 million barrels last week 
jim steel an energy analyst with refco inc said the report 
reflected growing seasonal demand for oil and oil products as the 
springsummer driving season gets under way he said that over the 
next few weeks gasoline prices could continue to drive crude 
futures higher 
gasoline has been so strong out of proportion to crude that 
players can buy crude and turn it into gasoline at a good profit 
he said

its the only completely computerized us 
securities market and the only one that didnt get overwhelmed 
during the october 1987 crash while rivals in new york chicago 
philadelphia and elsewhere foundered 
but the cincinnati stock exchange a hightech office couched in 
the centuryold dixie terminal building overlooking the ohio river 
remains relatively obscure and unknown to the broad investing 
public its an identity problem that angers and frustrates the 
exchanges president 
its time new york and the others recognized the time has 
come said richard b niehoff a third generation stockbroker who 
left the family business weil roth amp irving in 1979 to head the 
cincinnati market 
cincinnati was a small regional market handling mostly local 
stocks and overthecounter offerings until 1976 when the governors 
voted to automate they have updated and expanded several times 
the last in 1985 
i saw back in the 1970s that this was where the market was 
going we had a membership here and new york and philadelphia and i 
could see this just wasnt going to keep on working niehoff said 
i figured it would take about half a generation about 10 
years when people would start feeling comfortable about punching 
into a computer and thats about what it is taking he said 
cincinnati has teamed up with the chicago board options exchange 
and reuters holdings plc to link the two exchanges with thousands 
of computers around the world for trading 24 hours a day 
the system is not expected to be operating until 1990 it will 
need approval by the securities and exchange commission meanwhile 
the trading hours will remain 930 am until 4 pm eastern time 
the prospect of cincinnati emerging as a key link to a world 
trading market with immediate access to european and asian 
exchanges seems incongruous for this river city known primarily to 
outsiders as the home of pete roses redlegged baseball team and 
soap giant procter amp gamble co 
the exchange itself is a secondfloor office staffed by 20 
people more than half of them hunched over computer terminal 
screens in a silent hightech trading room watching the automated 
execution of orders placed electronically by buyers and sellers 
nationwide the staffers are watching for any unusual stock 
activity that might indicate insider trading or other abuses 
niehoff said cincinnati can handle up to 45 stock transactions 
per second far faster than the shouted orders and signals on wall 
street 
he noted that while the big exchanges have partly automated 
they still require personal contact between buyer and seller 
slowing everything 
the big brokers like merrill lynch painewebber and others 
have already set up their own automated systems and have bigger 
trading rooms than new york if you put them all together theyd 
make the new york stock exchange look like a second rate 
ballroom said niehoff 
end adv for sunday april 23

much of the us cotton business still is 
handled by memphis merchants but the days are past when buyers and 
sellers packed into the downtown cotton exchange to haggle over 
prices or trade gossip 
the big chalkboard 50 feet long and 10 feet high still 
dominates one wall of the trading room a highceilinged 
flashback of brass fans and gracefully arched windows 
but the real trading information comes by computer now and most 
of the exchanges 98 members have their own 
they dont necessarily need to come to the floor now said 
reta j martin secretary of the exchange its just a 
convenience for them to come in here and visit and talk 
the cotton exchange building a 12story blond stone affair at 
the corner of front street and union avenue in downtown memphis 
was built in 1924 and is on the national register of historic 
places 
the exchange itself was formed in 1873 and though the mechanics 
of trading have changed it still serves its original purpose of 
organizing the citys cotton business 
if a guy says ill give you 61 cents a pound for your cotton 
based on memphis cotton exchange rules everybody knows what youre 
talking about said w neely mallory jr president of the 
exchange it sets a standard of rules by which cotton is traded 
it also tries to assure the fair treatment of one merchant with 
another 
exchange membership has dropped from 175 to 98 over the years 
largely because of bigger firms absorbing smaller ones ms martin 
said 
the business in memphis is spot cotton or cotton for 
immediate delivery though many members of the exchange deal in 
futures trading too a tv monitor mounted in a wall below the big 
board carries figures from the chicago futures market 
ron cole chief of the market news branch of the us department 
of agriculture in memphis said its hard to get solid figures on 
how much business the citys cotton merchants conduct though they 
obviously handle the majority of domestic spot sales 
these firms are not willing to tell the government or anyone 
else how much business they do cole said 
the usda keeps up with cotton production he said but a crop 
can be bought and sold many times 
jess barr an economist with the national cotton council said 
all but two or three of the nations largest cotton dealers are 
members of the memphis exchange 
bill day an exchange member for 40 years estimated that 75 
percent of the domestic spot cotton market is handled by memphis 
companies 
this is my office day said on one of his daily visits to 
the trading room ive got an office next door but i only go 
there to pick up the mail 
day who describes himself as semiretired said the memphis 
exchange included a trading pit for cotton seed and soybean futures 
in the 1950s and two dozen representatives of chicago futures 
brokers worked the floor in the 1960s 
the trading room still has a bank of telephone booths and a 
dozen small windows once staffed by western union operators 
though some of the bigger companies are now in suburban business 
centers many exchange members still operate on front street the 
citys cotton row where bags of cotton samples called snakes 
often are piled along the sidewalks 
robert gardner whose family company gardner amp son inc is on 
cotton row said smaller firms still rely on the exchange for 
market information 
i can come in here and find out some prices and whats been 
selling recently who might be buying and who might be selling he 
said but when youre an international grain company you dont 
need to come down here 
the trading room generally draws a dozen or so visitors for 
brief visits each day ms martin said 
in its heyday though it drew packed crowds to watch the three 
walkers who manned the brassrailed walkway of the big board 
updating market figures from new york chicago and new orleans as 
well as memphis 
the exchange building too has changed from when it primarily 
housed merchants shippers and others in the cotton business the 
building was sold in 1983 to memphis real estate developer henry 
turley who refurbished it with an emphasis on brass etched glass 
and stone it now houses a range of business offices through the 
exchange still holds the bottom floor

textron inc reported firstquarter 
earnings thursday that were about 64 percent higher than those of 
the previous year when two extraordinary expenses held the 
companys performance down 
for the three months ended april 1 1989 textrons net income 
was 633 million or 73 cents per share compared with 387 
million or 43 cents per share during the comparable 1988 period 
the companys firstquarter 1988 income before the extraordinary 
losses was 684 million or 76 cents per share the extraordinary 
losses were caused by an arbitrators 20 million award against a 
subsidiary and some early debt retirement 
bf dolan chairman of the providencebased conglomerate said 
increased shipments and profits at textrons bell helicopter 
subsidiary were offset by increased costs on other programs and the 
completion last year of a military contract for aircraft wings 
earnings from avdel plc a british fastening systems 
manufacturing business that textron bought in early 1989 were not 
included in the report because the federal trade commission has 
ordered textron not to exercise control over the company until it 
considers the antitrust ramifications of the deal 
textron did list a 39 million interest expense stemming from 
its acquisition of avdel

cash incentives to leave their jobs as a result of premiers 
failure

the shutdown of the north sea brent oil field 
currently affecting nearly onefifth of britains oil production 
might last a month the government indicated thursday 
the news sent alreadystrong oil prices even higher the spot 
price for brent blend the most widely traded international crude 
oil rose to 2140 a barrel in london thursday afternoon from 
2105 late wednesday 
energy secretary cecil parkinson said in reponse to questions in 
the house of commons that two energy department inspectors were 
still at shell uk exploration and productions cormorant alpha 
platfrom where a gas leak and explosion on tuesday halted brent 
oil field production 
there were no injuries said the operator a unit of the royal 
dutchshell group of companies 
the cormorant alpha platform lies about 100 miles northeast of 
lerwick in shetland 
the cabinet minister who said he had spoken to the inspectors 
an hour previously said he couldnt say when the system would 
reopen until theyve completed their assessment he added that 
he couldnt estimate how long that assessment would take 
but the minister suggested in further comments that the 
cormorant platform wouldnt be reopened for three to four weeks 
reports of this time closure have been widely mentioned the 
minister said 
parkinson said that the closure of the cormorant alpha platform 
and other platforms in the brent field which routed their crude 
through cormorant to the sullom voe terminal has taken about 
400000 barrels a day or 17 percent of total north sea production 
out of the market 
other closures in the north sea already have curtailed 
production 
he said there hadnt been any structural damage to cormorant 
alpha 
shell has said that engineers might be able to divert brent 
field production so that it bypasses cormorant alpha 
parkinson said our best estimate of the effect assuming a 
fourtosix weeks closure is 800 million pounds 14 billion on 
the current account this year 
britain a big oil exporter produces an average 2 million 
barrels a day 
parkinson said his director of safety inspection wouldnt allow 
the brent production and transportation system reopened until all 
safety precautions were taken 
a fire on the occidental petroleum corpoperated piper alpha 
platform in the north sea last summer killed 167 men

the british dockworkers union on thursday 
recommended that a strike vote be taken in protest against a plan 
to abolish laws ensuring dockworkers lifelong job security 
a strike by dockworkers would affect operations at 46 british 
ports which are estimated to handle about 70 percent of britains 
foreign trade 
transport and general workers union deputy general secretary 
bill morris said the union would ask the 9400 dockworkers affected 
by the plans to authorize a strike 
the move follows the breakdown of talks tuesday between the 
union and the national association of port employers over a 
replacement for the 42yearold dock labor scheme 
morris said a committee of the union leadership and dockworkers 
agreed a strike would be in order reversing a decision on friday 
to refrain from striking pending negotiations with the employers 
group 
the results of the strike ballot would be announced within three 
weeks 
ron todd general secretary of the union had said following 
tuesdays meeting with port employers that the two sides were 
poles apart on a replacement for the scheme 
as many as a third of the workers covered by the dock labor laws 
walked off their jobs april 7 a day after prime minister margaret 
thatcher announced her intention to submit a bill abolishing the 
laws which had been designed to protect workers against casual 
labor 
critics of the scheme say it has led to abuses including 
dockworkers getting paid for not working 
mrs thatchers bill which includes compensation payments for 
dockworkers who lose their jobs as a result is expected to be 
passed later this year 
employers are expected to take legal action against the union in 
the event of a strike claiming the action amounts to an illegal 
protest against government policy rather than a dispute with 
management

hidden in the us trade deficit statistics is 
an area of strength that seldom if ever is revealed by traditional 
measurements the united states leads all other nations in the 
export of services 
very little is ever said about this simply because the usual 
measurements emphasize goods it is the same throughout the economy 
you hear about the industrial production index but never about a 
service production index 
in spite of this the majority of the american labor force and 
most of the capital is utilized in the service sector it isnt 
true that america is doing less manufacturing but it is true that 
it is becoming more service oriented 
services think of all the services you buy medical legal 
recreational educational transportation government is a service 
the tax preparer is a dispenser of services your insurance agent 
and stockbroker are servicers 
among the service categories are transportation communication 
electric gas and sanitary services wholesale trade retail trade 
finance insurance and real estate personal and social services 
and public administration 
recognition of the importance of services is slow to develop 
however not so much among the mass of americans but among public 
servants and their agencies there is for example no official 
services production index 
that gap in economic measurements is now being corrected not 
solely by government but by the coalition of service industries 
formed in 1982 by independent dispensers and users of services 
public awareness is the goal 
in pursuing that goal they have just issued a report on the 
international trade in services written by economists allen sinai 
and zaharo sofianou of the boston company economic advisors inc 
among the findings 
by country the largest service exporter is the united states 
which accounted for 174 percent of total world service exports in 
1987 followed by the united kingdom with a 124 percent share 
the united states had a favorable service export trade balance 
of 197 billion in 1987 canada japan and australia had service 
export deficits 
by country the united states is not only the worlds largest 
service exporter and importer but through 1987 had the worlds 
largest service trade surplus 
in terms of public understanding service exports and imports 
dont break down as neatly as do domestic services but they are 
services nevertheless being intangible they certainly cannot be 
classified as goods sinai and sofianou defined them as activities 
involving the international transfer of money in return for 
nontangible benefits 
and those benefits 
the first category is shipment charges including freight fees 
and often the insurance costs of exporting merchandise next is 
other transportation which is the price for transporting goods 
for other countries 
travel is a big and rapidly growing item income on investments 
made abroad is an important item interest income on foreign 
securities is a major item as is income from government services 
a large category other private receipts on services 
includes a miscellaneous assemblage of services provided to 
foreigners including advertising business and legal help 
in such areas does the united states excel even if it has been 
unable to correct its imbalance of trade in goods unfortunately 
the news isnt all good while it leads the world in service 
exports that lead is deteriorating 
in 1981 the united states had a service export trade balance of 
421 billion more than double the figure for 1987 japan 
meanwhile reduced its services trade deficit from 135 billion in 
1981 to to 59 billion in 1987 
even more significant is the improvement in service trade 
balances of developing nations in 1981 they had a 1085 billion 
deficit after remaining above 100 billion through 1984 the 
deficit fell to 699 billion in 1987 
the main factor contributing to the deterioration of the us 
position sinai and sofianou said is the higher payments to 
foreigners for their holdings of us securities

west germanys central bank citing continued 
high monetary growth unexpectedly raised key interest rates 
thursday spurring other european banks to follow suit 
the moves pushed the us dollar to its lowest levels since 
early march 
the bundesbank said it raised the discount rate 05 percentage 
point to 45 percent and the lombard rate to 65 percent from 60 
percent to further curb abovetarget monetary growth high 
moneysupply growth could fuel inflation 
the lombard rate is used for emergency funding and typically is 
higher than the discount rate 
the bundesbank noted in a statement that monetary expansion in 
the federal republic continues to be stronger than justifiable in a 
stabilityoriented policy 
the moves were followed by the dutch central bank which raised 
its discount rate half a point to 55 percent the austrian 
national bank raised its discount and lombard rates half a point to 
50 percent and 65 percent respectively 
an official in france said the government isnt planning to 
tighten its credit policy to match the bundesbanks move we 
arent dependent on the germans an economics ministry official 
said but he did not rule out a french rate hike if the francs 
stability were endangered or if inflationary pressures surface 
although the swiss national bank last week boosted its discount 
rate half a point to 45 percent and the lombard rate one point to 
70 percent financial markets were taken by surprise by thursdays 
apparently coordinated interestrate action 
the dollar fell more than 15 pfennigs to 18430 marks its 
lowest level since it finished at 18368 marks on march 1 in new 
york 
i dont think anyone expected this said a foreign exchange 
trader at a large frankfurt bank the market was totally relaxed 
there was no tension no speculation no pressure at all the 
bundesbank has been saying for the last two months that theres no 
inflation angst that theyll keep close tabs on inflation but at 
the moment theres nothing to worry about 
indeed bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said as 
recently as last week that the central bank saw no need to raise 
interest rates at present

rjr nabisco inc reported a 62 percent drop in 
firstquarter net income thursday blaming the decline on the costs 
of its takeover by kohlberg kravis roberts inc and the failure of 
its smokeless cigarette 
the company reported net income of 103 million down from 273 
million in the same quarter a year ago and earnings per share of 
44 cents down from 109 in the first quarter of 1988 
sales in the quarter were up 5 percent to 4 billion from 38 
billion in 1988 
without the mergerrelated costs and a charge for the 
discontinued test of its premier smokeless cigarette earnings per 
share would have been 141 and net income would have been up 17 
percent to 320 million in the first quarter rjr nabisco said 
if you adjust it the earnings gains look good said emanuel 
goldman an industry analyst with painewebber group inc in san 
francisco 
also thursday rjr nabisco officials refused comment on a wall 
street journal report that the consumer products company planned to 
move its corporate headquarters from atlanta to new york the 
journal said the announcement could come at rjr nabiscos annual 
meeting next thursday 
there had been talk of a move back to north carolina since the 
kohlberg kravis takeover but analysts noted that louis gerstner 
jr rjrs new chairman and chief executive officer is a new 
yorker 
gerstner who lives in greenwich conn was president of 
american express co before his move to rjr nabisco 
have you ever noticed how often a corporate headquarters ends 
up not too far from the chief executive officers abode goldman 
said its not unheard of it would not be a surprise it would 
be a surprise if it stayed in atlanta 
rjr nabisco moved its headquarters to atlanta two years ago from 
winstonsalem nc its home for more than a century 
new yorkbased kohlberg kravis succeeded in its 25 billion 
takeover of rjr nabisco in february and rjr said its firstquarter 
results were reduced by 247 million because of change of 
control costs associated with the merger 
the industry norm for such costs no longer applies said bob 
young an analyst with dean witter reynolds in new york lbo 
leveraged buyout mergers have very high fees 
in a leveraged buyout debt incurred to finance the acquisition 
is repaid with the target companys cash flow or sale of its assets 
other mergerrelated costs will be reflected in earnings once 
the merger is complete the earnings statement said a 
stockholders meeting to formally approve the merger is scheduled 
for april 27 
test marketing of the smokeless premier cigarette was 
discontinued in february rjr nabisco said the failure resulted in 
a 55 million charge against earnings in the first quarter 
the companys rj reynolds tobacco subsidiary has said 700 
employees will be offered early retirement or cash incentives to 
leave their jobs as a result 
still gerstner said he saw a solid performance in the quarter 
that demonstrates the basic strength of our tobacco and food 
businesses and provides a foundation for continued progress

more than 10000 investors nationwide lost in 
excess of 50 million to california telemarketing firms raided in 
the biggestever us attack against boiler room scams 
authorities said thursday 
securities investigators from seven states california texas 
georgia missouri oklahoma kansas and new mexico took part in 
the april 1118 raids on highpressure boiler room operations 
throughout california 
investigators said five people were arrested and booked for 
investigation of securities or commodities fraud during raids at 12 
california locations in addition approximately one ton of records 
was seized 
the arrests included steve scott moleski 29 of lake arrowhead 
todd thomas roberts 28 of suburban woodland hills john treat 
zimmerman 35 of escondido hiromichi hiro hirshara 37 of laguna 
hills and richard l besancon 53 of corona 
at least five more arrests were anticipated six additional 
arrests were made on unrelated outstanding warrants and 
miscellaneous drug charges authorities said 
the unprecedented scale of the raids reflects a heightened 
concern about the rapidly growing national problem of investment 
telemarketing fraud estimated to fleece consumers of 10 billion 
annually said doug mays chairman of the north american securities 
administrators association inc 
americans lose 1 million an hour to investment scams promoted 
over the telephone the washingtonbased association said 
we want to send a clear message to the hundreds of investment 
con artists and swindlers here in southern california crooks who 
cheat tens of thousands of americans out of billions of dollars 
each year well be back said mays who is also the kansas 
securities commissioner 
telemarketing scams in the los angeles area result in up to 4 
billion each year in investor losses making it the investment scam 
capital of the united states according to a southern california 
boiler room task force report 
 
these raids are motivated by a desire to make sure that 
investment con artists who operate by phone know that they are 
being watched and stand a good chance of getting arrested and 
prosecuted said 
the telemarketing firms targeted by investigators were promoting 
interests in petroleum partnerships and unmined gold socalled 
dirt pile scams supposedly available to investors at half the 
world spotmarket prices 
the sevenstate telemarketing investigation was underwritten 
with 175000 from the federallyfunded leviticus project 
association comprised of 29 criminal justice and regulatory 
agencies in 20 states 
gw mcdonald of the california department of corporations said 
many of the victims were unsophisticated firsttime investors who 
couldnt afford the losses but were attracted to the investments 
because of lingering fears about the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
the elderly and retirees are also heavily represented in the 
ranks of victims he said 
the firms raided were midwest petroleum of los angeles samps 
petroleum of lake arrowhead vulcan mining and development and 
esmeralda mining of escondido westar international of thousand 
oaks capital international trading of santa ana frontier energy 
of santa ana cumberland oil and gas of mission viejo cambridge

small businesses should contribute more than 
half of the 26 million new jobs estimated to be created this year 
according to a study released thursday 
but dun amp bradstreet corps annual survey of 5000 firms noted 
that the number of new jobs employers expect to create is down 26 
percent from the 36 million new jobs actually created last year 
while the slowdown had been expected dun amp bradstreet corporate 
economist joseph duncan said the forecast for 1989 is still 
remarkably strong especially in view of the substantial growth in 
new jobs already achieved during the current economic expansion 
since 1983 between 2 million and 4 million new jobs have been 
created each year he noted 
businesses with fewer than 100 employees will account for 566 
percent of all the new jobs created this year dun amp bradstreet 
said while firms with fewer than 20 workers said they plan to 
increase employment by 35 percent corporations with more than 
25000 employees expect their payrolls to increase by 08 percent 
the survey showed that new positions in the wholesale retail 
and services sector should account for 565 percent of the overall 
job gain manufacturing jobs will account for 191 percent while 
finance insurance and real estate positions will account for 89 
percent of the years employment gains

whittle communications lp does not need 
the support of national education groups to have a successful 
satellite news program in the countrys classrooms the company 
chairman says 
chris whittle said the knoxville media company will spend the 
next several months deciding if it wants to try to sell the news 
concept to 10000 school boards across the country 
testing of the daily 12minute news programs called channel 
one ends friday at six schools each program includes two minutes 
of advertisements 
whittle speaking wednesday to an entrepreneurship class at 
belmont college said hes optimistic channel one will be continued 
after the class whittle said he didnt anticipate the 
controversy that has arisen about the news programs he said he was 
particularly upset by people who opposed the programs before they 
viewed them or talked to anyone who did 
they took a position before they did their homework whittle 
said 
channel one can work without support from national education 
groups because education is still locally controlled he said 
but he acknowledged having them against us doesnt make our 
jobs any easier 
whittle communications has offered to install about 50000 
worth of video equipment in schools to beam in the news programs 
but groups such as the national association of secondary school 
principals and the national parentteacher association objected to 
the commercials saying it was unfair to subject students to paid 
advertising in classrooms 
whittle has said it plans to review resaearch compiled during 
the sevenweek test and talk with teachers administrators and 
students at the six test schools before deciding if it will make 
the program available nationally in the fall of 1990 the company 
also must determine if there is enough advertising support to 
finance a national rollout equipment alone for the schools could 
cost more than 100 million 
the six test schools are in knoxville kansas city kan 
cerritos calif billerica mass cincinnati and detroit 
on another topic whittle said the company probably will turn 
the unprofitable tennessee illustrated publication into a 
quarterly rather than continue it as a bimonthly 
he said a major problem with the state magazine was that we 
misjudged the size of our market finding advertisers for a 
statewide audience he said has been difficult 
whittle communications founded in 1970 by whittle and several 
former university of tennessee classmates has pioneered a niche in 
publishing by using single advertisers in its magazines videos and 
other products 
the companys magazines are not sold through subscriptions or 
newsstands like typical publications but are available for free in 
places such as doctors offices and hairstyling salons 
the company also uses one or a small number of advertisers each 
giving exclusivity in their product categories in its 40 media 
products 
whittle announced tuesday it will begin producing short books 
with advertisements beginning this fall 
the books will have about 20 percent advertising and will be 
written by prominent figures such as david halberstam and john 
kenneth galbraith 
whittle said the companys market research showed that many 
people dont have time for lengthy nonfiction books and that they 
will not object to ads in books

nearly all of americas largest corporations 
are contributing time money or materials to local schools but 
most dont think their efforts have improved a troubled system 
says a study released thursday 
top executives at 404 of the countrys largest companies gave 
public schools an average grade of cminus not a single one rated 
the schools excellent and only eight called them very good 
the probject was sponsored by fortune magazine and allstate 
insurance co 
merle sprinzen director of market research for fortune said 
the survey was conducted in the past two months to learn how the 
education system is affecting corporations and how they are 
responding 
according to the survey 64 percent of the executives believe 
the system has deteriorated in the past decade and nearly half say 
business productivity is down because of poor basic education more 
than a third of the companies offer remedial classes to employees 
and nearly that many more say they are willing to do so in the 
future 
asked to identify causes of public education problems the 
executives cited poorly disciplined and poorly motivated students 
uninvolved parents undermotivated and undertrained teachers and 
low academic standards their suggested solutions included better 
training and salaries for teachers a longer school year and more 
parental involvement 
while 96 percent of the executives said their companies donate 
time materials or money to schools only 22 percent felt their 
efforts had made an impact on the quality of education in their 
areas 
the most common education activities were jobs and job 
counseling to students money and equipment for schools and 
encouraging employees to teach or serve on school boards the 
survey found however it also found that most energy and resources 
were going to colleges high schools and vocational schools only 
35 percent of corporations were involved with elementary junior 
high or preschool students 
some corporations are taking broader action such as supporting 
tax increases for education and lobbying their state legislatures 
for changes the survey found but they were in the minority 
the survey was released at an allstate forum in conjunction with 
a book on corporate response to deficiencies in the education 
system the book was presented to labor secretary elizabeth dole 
and will be distributed to school districts and pta chapters across 
the country according to allstate vice president ken graham 
among other things the book recommends more definitive 
standards higher pay and meaningful career paths for teachers and 
greater encouragement for corporate employees to run for school 
boards and get involved in community education issues 
fortune sent questionnaires to chief executive officers of the 
500 largest service corporations and the 500 largest industrial 
corporations in the country

the 1990 geo prizm hatchback is a wellbalanced small family 
car its eyecatching and stylish outside but not racy its 
interior strikes a nice balance neither spartan nor opulent its 
engine and transmission perform smoothly yet you can expect good 
fuel economy 
most of all the prizm available in sedan and fourdoor 
hatchback models starts at under 10000 
relatively new to showrooms it began arriving early this year 
the prizm is the top of the line of the new geo nameplate that 
chevrolet is giving its dealers to attract more import car buyers 
the prizm is the chevrolet dealers replacement for the nova 
that little subcompact praised for its quality but a bit lackluster 
in its sales numbers 
if the stares that the bright red prizm test car got from 
onlookers are any indication the prizm might have no trouble 
surpassing the nova for starters target buyers are a broad group 
chevrolet says they look to attract buyers with median age of 30 
who have young families it also looks for empty nesters with 
median age of 45 
median household income ranges from 30000 to 41000 and 55 
percent are likely to be women about half will be college 
graduates occupations range from clerical to managerial and 
semiprofessional chevrolet says 
for these buyers the prizm is designed to care for the 
practical family in style and comfort the company says the prizm 
lsi hatchback test car also had some features that reminded me of 
higherpriced cars 
for example the rear hatchback styling seemed reminiscent of 
the acura integra and the lsis full center console with cassette 
storage was about as roomy as the one on the mazda 929 
as expected from the fremont calif plant where the prizm is 
built jointly by toyota motor corp and general motors corp and 
where the highquality nova also was produced the test car had 
superb fit and finish fuel economy was noteworthy after 100 hard 
miles the needle on the fuel gauge hadnt budged 
the 16liter fuelinjected 16valve fourcylinder engine was 
teamed with the optional threespeed automatic transmission and 
responded reasonably well it worked up to speed in a smooth 
timely manner there were no jerks or whines the dashboard gauges 
were large and easy to read there was plenty of room up front but 
it might be a close fit for three adults in back 
legroom in back was fine if the front seats were moved up some 
but knees would be hitting the back of the front seats if those 
seats were pushed back all the way in the lsi the rear seatback 
split and folded down for more cargo space be wary of tangling the 
rear shoulder belts when pushing the seat back up however 
there was some road noise in the test car but it was not overly 
obtrusive fourwheel independent suspension helped ease the car 
over bumps one thing i didnt care for was the fact i had to move 
the driver seat back to reach the remote fuel filler door lock and 
to open the trunk from inside the levers were difficult to reach 
otherwise 
since the prizm is a new car consumer reports magazine has no 
reports of owner troubles chevrolet said it had no projections for 
sales this year 
competition is fierce in this market segment prizm competitors 
include the nissan sentra with a fourdoor model that starts at 
more than 8800 the mazda 323 with a fourdoor model that starts 
at more than 8300 and the honda civic sedan which starts at 
more than 9100

texas instruments inc will spend 129 billion on 
construction and research this year as the technology giant tries 
to get more of the worlds semiconductor and defense business the 
company said thursday while reporting slightly lower firstquarter 
earnings 
at its annual stockholders meeting the company said it had net 
income of 846 million or 90 cents a share on sales of 156 
billion in the first three months of the year 
that compares to 855 million or 95 cents per share on sales 
of 147 billion in the same period last year 
texas instruments chairman jerry r junkins told stockholders 
the dallasbased company will spend 525 million on research and 
development and 760 million in capital expenditures by the end of 
the year 
chief financial officer bill aylesworth said 127 million 
already had been spent in the first quarter and 150 million on 
capital projects 
aylesworth said the research will focus on improvements in logic 
devices on the semiconductor side and in improving radar technology 
for defense systems 
he said such research is the lifeblood of ti and is a key to 
winning current and anticipated defense contracts 
meanwhile junkins warned shareholders not to expect too much 
from tis defense operations 
during the past several months ti has won defense contracts 
that could be worth between 7 and 11 billion to the company 
but junkins said the department of defense is facing a period 
of tight budget constraints and they need more affordable 
systems 
we are optimistic about the future of our defense electronics 
business in the next decade but we must be realistic about the 
nearterm environment he said its going to be a tougher 
period for defense contractors in general and it means lower 
nearterm growth in our business 
junkins also said the company was changing the thrust of its 
commercial equipment sector to take advantage of a significant 
opportunity for ti in advanced information management 
in the past much of our emphasis has been on hardware 
computers controllers terminals etc and our financial 
performance has been totally unsatisfactory junkins said for 
the future we are reorienting our strategies to put more emphasis 
on applications software and systemlevel solutions areas with 
inherently higher margin potential 
texas instruments said its earnings were lower because of 
decreased royalty income from its patents although junkins said the 
company expects to continue to receive royalty income well into the 
90s 
royalty income was 32 million during the first quarter 
ti which invented the integrated circuit 30 years ago earned 
3663 million all of last year on sales of 629 billion 
the company manufactures and sells semiconductors defense 
electronic systems computer systems various electrical systems 
and consumer electronics products

analysts said that in addition to wanting to stem inflationary 
momentum the west germans increased rates to prevent capital from 
flowing to switzerland which recently increased its key interest 
rates 
concern is brewing that britain andor japan may follow suit 
which would put further pressure on the dollar as well as the us 
economy said jack barbanel a senior vice president at gruntal amp 
co 
money will move to those currencies where interest rate 
yield is the highest and where there is greatest economic 
stability barbanel said 
while interest rate differentials still slightly favor the 
dollar our currency gets weaker on the possibility of an 
economic slowdown here he added

dollar rose to 13228 japanese yen from 13188 yen on wednesday

a group of disgruntled washington teachers 
warn in a newspaper advertisement that businesses considering 
expanding into the state to think again 
our educational system is in decline we cant guarantee 
you a quality worker because our state wont pay for quality 
schools said the ad placed in thursdays west coast edition of 
the wall street journal 
it placed much of the blame on gov booth gardner and the state 
legislature a spokesman for the governor called the ad 
counterproductive 
jon holdaway a vocalarts and drama teacher at cedarcrest 
junior high school in spanaway just south of tacoma purchased the 
ad on behalf of a group called washington teachers united for fully 
funded schools 
he said about 500 teachers helped pay 1400 to place the ad 
which was carried in the journals edition distributed in 13 
western states including alaska and hawaii 
holdaway said it was unrealistic to think the ad would change 
any businessmans mind in expanding business into washington 
however he said i do fear that in the future businesses wont 
be able to get qualified workers and thats a far greater threat 
to business in our state 
the ad said washington has the fourthlargest class size in the 
nation ranks 46th in textbook purchases per student and 50th in 
change in teacher salaries 
onefourth of the states school buildings are unsafe or 
inadequate the ad said adding our governor and legislature 
refuse to support full funding of our public schools 
gardner and the legislature whose annual session ends after 
this week have been considering various proposal for funding 
education none of which are considered full support 
teachers have criticized gardner for refusing to appropriate 
part of a 400 million state budget windfall to boost teachers 
salaries 
we have an image come to washington because we have a 
welleducated population holdaway said but we have a 
mediocre education system in this state it used to be one of the 
best 
holdaway cited as his sources various studies done by the 
national education association the education writers association 
and the corporation for enterprise development 
dick milne spokesman for gardner said the governor considers 
education a priority we acknowledge that there are some areas 
that we would like to do better he said class size is one of 
those teacher salaries is another 
senate ways and means committee chairman dan mcdonald 
rbellevue defended legislative action saying the senates 
version of a state budget now in conference with the house contains 
512 million in enhancements for education 
richard page chief administrator of the washington roundtable 
which represents business interests in the education system said 
the ad does identify serious weaknesses in the system 
its a bit alarmist but i applaud him page said there 
are lots of ways to quibble with his points its easy to say hes 
off base but the roundtable and business in general agree there 
are serious flaws in our public education system 
page said however that holdaway and the teachers group were 
misrepresenting washingtons educational system by excluding some 
of its strengths for example state residents have completed more 
years of schooling than residents of at least 45 other states and 
its scholastic achievement tests consistently are above average he 
said 
ronn robinson gardners education assistant was less 
understanding about the onesided picture holdaway painted 
i think its unfortunate that he feels impelled to take out 
such an ad which misrepresents the degree to which our schools are 
standing compared to others robinson said our salaries are 
not as bad as this ad implies 
cliff finch legislative affairs counsel for the association of 
washington business said he believed readers would not take the ad 
seriously 
i think the readership of that newspaper is too sophisticated 
to take that ad at face value he said

ford motor co says it had jumped into the 
growing quick oilchange business a move that could affect 
thousands of small businesses nationwide 
i hope it hurts him service manager harold grass of 
fairlane ford in dearborn mich said of a quaker state minitlube 
shop across michigan avenue from his dealership 
apparently it already has 
its slowed down some minitlube employee ken matchette 
said thursday 
even though grass has had his quick oilchange business running 
since october hes still only getting a fraction of the business 
that the minitlube enjoys fairlane ford averages about 15 of the 
fast oil changes a day compared with 70 to 80 daily at minitlube 
john kerekanich accessory merchandising manager for fords 
parts and service division said quick oilchange service 
operations began in the early 1980s and have grown steadily since 
then he speculated there would be about 6000 of them nationwide 
by 1992 
like the smaller standalone oilchange operations he added 
no appointment is necessary the work will be done within 15 
minutes and will cost about 20 
grass said his dealership completes the average oil change in 
seven or eight minutes and charges 1995 2 less than the 
minitlube 
fords pilot program began last june with five dealers in 
chicago and expanded to 25 nationwide in october kerekanich said 
ford expects the program to grow to about 35 percent of its 5600 
ford and lincolnmercury dealers in the united states 
he said not all dealers are suited for the program which will 
require a separate area in the service bay and a separate billing 
area the main reasons chrysler corp hasnt gotten into the 
business 
our feeling is that there are some difficulties that have not 
been resolved yet in terms of being able to match the 
convenience of the drivethrough operations chrysler spokesman 
tom houston said he said the company did a survey of dealerships a 
few years ago and found no overwhelming desire for such a 
corporationsponsored service 
general motors corp spokesman duane poole said the nations 
largest automaker is looking into the matter but did not 
anticipate a decision soon 
kerekanich said a ford dealer could invest up to 22000 to 
start the quick oilchange operation depending on the available 
facilities grass converted an unused carwash bay cutting his 
initial costs he also said he has hired two people just for the 
oil change operation 
kerekanich also said ford is encouraging its dealers to offer 
the service to all makes and models of cars something that grass 
has declined 
sorry ford and lincolnmercury vehicles only he said

nwa inc parent of northwest airlines 
and the target of a hostile takeover thursday reported its largest 
firstquarter profit of the decade 
billionaire oilman marvin davis on thursday launched a 
90ashare hostile tender offer for nwa the companys board of 
directors earlier rejected a similar offer as inadequate 
firstquarter net earnings of 126 million or 43 cents a 
share marked the first time in four years nwa has posted 
firstquarter net earnings the company said 
the 126 million profit compares with a net loss of 435 
million in the first quarter of 1988 
these results counter our traditional financial performance in 
a cyclical industry where the first quarter with its lower travel 
demand has typically resulted in net losses said steve 
rothmeier nwa chairman and chief executive officer in fact our 
earnings for the first three months of 1989 are outstanding 
firstquarter results 
firstquarter revenue increased 193 percent to 148 billion 
from 124 billion a year earlier

rose in early april the federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose 
500 million in the week ended april 10 to a seasonally adjusted 
7815 billion from 7810 billion the previous week 
the central bank said a broader measure called m2 rose 2

and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 
3 percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent

averaged 997 million a day in the week ended wednesday up from 
227 million the previous week and the highest since borrowings 
averaged 137 billion in the week ended jan 4 
the fed said the heavy borrowings in the latest week were due 
mostly to a surge in borrowings wednesday night reflecting a 
scarcity of funds in the federal funds market wherte banks loan to 
each other ovbernight 
the federal reserve bank of st louis reported that the 
monetary base the seasonally adjusted total of member bank 
reserves held at federal reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and 
in circulation was 2875 billion in the twoweek period ended

gold and silver futures prices rose moderately thursday on new 
yorks commodity exchange after surprise increases in two key west 
german interest rates knocked down the dollar 
meanwhile platinum and palladium prices surged on the new york 
mercantile exchange on renewed speculative buying linked to recent 
nuclearfusion experiments 
on other markets petroleum prices were broadly mixed wheat 
prices fell while most other grains and soybeans advanced and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold settled 220 to 260 higher with the contract for 
delivery in june at 38930 a troy ounce silver was 22 cents to 
26 cents higher with may at 5787 a troy ounce 
the rise in gold and silver prices corresponded with a drop in 
the dollars value against other major currencies following 
increases of 05 percent in the west german discount rate and west 
germanys equivalent of the prime lending rate 
currency traders responded to the increased lending rates by 
buying west german marks and selling us dollars a weaker dollar 
promotes foreign purchases of us goods which helps the us 
economy and could lead to higher inflation in this country 
gold and silver are generally viewed as investment hedges 
against inflation so demand for the metals tends to rise and fall 
with inflationary expectations 
a sharp increase in crudeoil and unleaded gasoline prices also 
fanned inflation fears and contributed to golds rally analysts 
said 
peter cardillo commodities trading adviser with josephthal amp 
co in new york said golds chart patterns indicated a bullish 
trend in the making he noted that gold for june delivery had 
bottomed out at 38570 an ounce on wednesday and 38580 an ounce 
on thursday indicating the market was unlikely to fall below that 
area 
weve formed a good bottom here and i think this market is 
getting ready to surprise everyone cardillo said 
jitters about coldfusion research persisted in the platinum and 
palladium markets both metals have been used in recent experiments 
in which scientists claim to have recreated in a jar of water the 
nuclear reaction that powers the sun and stars 
platinum settled 670 to 820 higher with july at 55620 a 
troy ounce palladium was 780 higher across the board with june 
at 17485 a troy ounce 
crudeoil and unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply on the new 
york merc on supply fears linked to the shutdown of a north sea oil 
rig tuesday following an explosion 
heating oil futures prices fell though reflecting expectations 
for more springlike weather in the northeastern united states 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 47 
cents higher with june at 2128 a barrel heating oil was was 40 
cent to 104 cents lower with may at 5229 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 75 cent lower to 113 cents higher with may at 7464 
cents a gallon 
wheat futures moved lower on the chicago board of trade 
following a national weather service forecast for aboveaverage 
precipitation next week in the wheat fields of kansas 
corn futures finished little changed while oats and soybeans 
were slightly higher reflecting conflicting weather forecasts for 
the midwest where spring planting is beginning 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in may at 409 a bushel corn was cent lower to cent 
higher with may at 272 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents 
higher with may at 198 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5 
cents higher with may at 747 a bushel 
cattle futures finished mostly higher on firmer cash markets and 
perceptions that wednesdays steep losses were overdone 
frozen pork bellies fell to new lifeofcontract lows for the 
second consecutive day amid expectations that fridays monthly cold 
storage report from the agriculture department will show record 
levels of bellies in the nations commercial freezers 
live cattle settled 05 cent lower to 55 cent higher with june

the state supreme court on thursday let 
stand a jury verdict awarding an investor group 20 percent of the 
stock of the computer franchise giant computerland 
in a case that started with a 250000 loan the court 
unanimously denied a hearing on an appeal by computerland and its 
founder william millard from a lowercourt ruling upholding the 
stock award 
during the lawsuit millard was driven from control of the 
oaklandbased company 
herbert hafif lawyer for the investor group called microvest 
estimated the worth of computerland at 500 million he said 
microvest would own 285 percent of computerland including an 
additional 85 percent under terms of an earlier settlement 
the 250000 loan was made to millard more than 12 years ago in 
the early stages of his venture it gave the lender the right to 
exchange the note for 20 percent of the stock in millards 
business microvest later bought the note and sued millard after 
he refused to transfer the stock in 1981 
an alameda county superior court jury awarded microvest 20 
percent of computerland and 141 million in damages the damages 
were dropped in december 1985 in a partial settlement that included 
additional stock as well as millards resignation from the 
companys board 
computerland now operates under new management 
in appealing the jury verdict millard argued that the 
stockconversion feature of the original 250000 loan applied only 
to his original computer company called ims he said the company 
went out of existence after a merger 
he also said he had agreed orally with one of the original 
lenders that the note and stock option would not be transferred 
without millards consent 
the 1st district court of appeal rejected those arguments in a 
ruling dec 29

dunkin donuts inc said thursday it will sell 
more than a million shares of stock to employees and cut its 
corporate work force 14 percent after a torontobased investment 
bank made hostile overtures for the doughnut giant 
dunkin donuts said it would fight any takeover bid by 
kingsbridge capital group a subsidiary of unicorp canada corp 
which said it acquired a 66 percent stake and may seek control of 
the doughnut maker with more than 1700 stores worldwide 
we dont know who these people are said richard n hart 
jr dunkin donuts vice president and treasurer our intention 
of course has been to still be an independent company 
dunkin donuts whose ads feature a man rising in the middle of 
the night because hes gotta go make the doughnuts announced 
it was consolidating doughnut shop operations and trimming its 
corporate work force by about 80 people 
the company said it plans to sell 11 million shares of common 
stock to employees and to continue purchasing its stock on the open 
market in two apparent antitakeover measures 
it also said it amended its bylaws to allow stockholders to buy 
twice their holdings if a single buyer acquires 15 percent of the 
company 
in papers filed with the securities and exchange commission 
kingsbridge capital group said it would continue to buy dunkin 
donuts stock and raised the possibility of a leveraged buyout 
kingsbridge said its options included buying up more shares of 
dunkin donuts proposing a merger mounting a hostile takeover or 
a waging proxy battle for control of the companys board 
kingsbridge said it has spent 134 million in buying 422000 
shares of dunkin donuts 66 percent of the shares outstanding as 
of feb 28 
the action sent dunkin donuts stock shooting up 162 to close 
at 3787 in overthecounter trading thursday 
dunkin donuts owns or franchises 1786 stores in the united 
states mexico canada and japan with total sales last year of 
750 million according to wall street analysts 
the company reported 1988 earnings of 135 million or 205 a 
share on revenue of 1128 million 
analysts said they believe the prosperous and wellknown 
doughnutmaker would fight a takeover bid 
here is a company has not had a down year since 1974 said 
willard w brown an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york 
there is no question in my mind that this company is extremely 
well managed he said since 1974 there have been several 
recessions and they continue to make money every year 
the most kingsbridge could afford to pay per share without 
selling off real estate or other major assets would be 40 per 
share brown said and dunkin donuts stock already is near that 
figure 
we cant see anything over 40 it looks real difficult to do 
that brown said 
kingsbridge said it plans to file a formal report with the 
federal trade commission and the justice department under the 
hartscottrodino laws relating to acquisition of more than 15 
million but less than 15 percent of a companys outstanding shares 
because of dunkin donuts antitakeover provisions bylaws and 
shareholder rights plan kingsbridge said it has no immediate plans 
to acquire 15 percent or more of dunkin donuts

promising a significantly changed 
weyerhaeuser co the woodproducts giant said thursday it would 
review its businesses reorganizing and selling those that might do 
better on their own to increase returns to shareholders 
while the company reported a 29 percent increase in profit 
thursday for a record first quarter chairman and chief executive 
george weyerhaeuser said that wasnt good enough 
our performance overall is not satisfactory to us in 
competitive terms he told shareholders 
president john creighton said the review of businesses which 
include pulp and paper timber products real estate mortgage 
financing nursery supply and personal care products would begin 
next month 
the effort is focused primarily on developing improvement 
strategies and plans for achieving a leadership position in each 
and every business sector in which we choose to compete he said 
the review would appear to put at risk at least part of the 
centuryold companys traditional timber business especially 
logging and milling while its pulp and paper mills have been 
highly profitable in recent years it has said it would get rid of 
its logging operations altogether and give the work to contract 
loggers if its workers didnt accept what amounted to major pay 
cuts 
a significantly changed weyerhaeuser co will emerge as the 
outcome of these efforts said creighton i expect it to have 
fewer and a less complex group of businesses 
weyerhaeuser reported its profit for the quarter ended march 26 
was 148 million or 70 cents a share compared with 115 million 
or 54 cents a share for the same quarter in 1988 
sales also hit a firstquarter record at 23 billion up 9 
percent 
the board also declared a dividend of 30 cents per share on 
common stock payable may 30 to shareholders of record on april 28 
weyerhaeuser said the arctic cold front that hammered the 
country in february hit the company hard but that strength in pulp 
and paper markets and in weyerhaeuser real estate co dealings 
contributed to the improvement in earnings 
he said weak spots included weyerhaeuser mortgage co which was 
buffeted by higher interest rates nursery supply due to the 
weather and personal care products due to development costs

general ceramics inc and federal officials 
continued to work on an agreement thursday that would allow the 
company to be purchased by a japanese firm officials said 
desiree tucker sorini a us treasury department spokeswoman 
said she could not confirm published reports that general ceramics 
agreed to divest itself of defenserelated operations to allow it 
to be acquired by tokuyama soda co of japan 
the treasury department is part of the interagency committee on 
foreign investment in the united states which is reviewing the 
acquisition 
but ms sorini said the company had withdrawn its notice of sale 
from the interagency panel gaining it time to physically transfer 
equipment to a new owner if it is divesting 
carolyn gagas a company spokeswoman declined to discuss the 
deal thursday 
ms gagas referred to a company statement released monday that 
said tokuyama soda expects to proceed with the proposed transaction 
when arrangements satisfactory to the government have been worked 
out 
general ceramics is the sole supplier of beryllium oxide parts 
used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons the company holds a 
classified contract with martinmarietta energy systems inc the 
primary contract operator of the defense departments vast y12 
plant at oak ridge tenn 
if the company divests itself of defenserelated aspects of its 
business the panel is likely to recommend that president bush 
allow tokuyama soda to take over general ceramics officials have 
said 
the law under which the bush administration stopped the 
acquisition was passed in august it gives the administration the 
power to go to court to block deals that endanger national security 
this was the first time a foreign acquisition had been blocked 
since enactment of the law said douglas elmets an energy 
department spokesman 
the committee on foreign investment is composed of 
representatives of the treasury state commerce defense justice 
and energy departments and the office of the us trade 
representative 
earlier this year bush cleared monsanto cos sale of a silicon
