three italian fighter jets crashed 
during an air show at a us military base sunday and one swooped 
into the crowd and burst into a huge fireball at least 46 people 
died and hundreds were hurt officials said 
several children and the three aircraft pilots members of a 
famed aerial stunt team were among the dead at the ramstein air 
base about 60 miles southwest of frankfurt authorities reported 
a giant ball of flame engulfed fleeing spectators when one 
aircraft hit the ground sending many screaming with their clothes 
on fire television footage showed cars and trucks in flames 
some people stood in shock as a thick cloud of smoke enveloped 
them and others ran toward the scene to administer aid 
news reports said 500 people were injured nearly half of them 
hospitalized 
it was horrible horrible a huge shock said krista banks 
a west german who works as a waitress at the base its going to 
take a long time to forget this 
west german officials estimated the size of the crowd at the air 
show at 200000 and said most were americans and germans 
us and west german officials said the cause of the triple 
crash was unknown and the exact sequence of events was unclear 
but it appeared two of the aermacchi mb 339as collided headon 
during a complex manuever by the 10aircraft stunt team then 
crashed away from the crowd 
a third jet veered uncontrollably out of formation flames 
spewing from its fuselage and headed toward the crowd then 
exploded into a huge fireball an estimated 100 feet high 
the ramstein air show has drawn protests for several years 
because of possible dangers to civilians demonstrators already 
were protesting outside the bases gates as sundays air show began 
west german defense minister rupert scholz immediately canceled 
an air show by west german warplanes planned for september and 
asked the countrys nato partners to consider following these 
same measures for the time being 
mrs banks wife of an american who is a us army employee 
said she was in the control tower when the accident occurred 
there was a big flash of flame and smoke and people were 
running away everyone at the tower was in shock said mrs banks 
we saw the fireball racing toward us so we first threw 
ourselves down on the ground said detlef hosser cameraman with 
the ard television network 
television footage had one man frantically shrieking tanya 
tanya and thousands of others screaming and looking for friends 
and family members 
hansjuergen vollmer spokesman for the kaiserslautern 
administrative area that includes ramstein said he believed the 
crash started from a pilots mistake 
it looks as though it the accident was caused by pilot 
error he told the associated press 
the three jets were part of a 10plane italian air force 
demonstration team frecce tricolori that was flying 65 yards 
above the ground 
the frecce tricolori which means tricolor arrows and 
refers to the threecolored italian flag was founded in 1930 as a 
school of aerobatics since 1956 it has been a separate unit of 
the italian air force based at rivolto 
ramstein air base spokesman doug moore said those dead on the 
ground are a mix of civilian and military 
afn the us military radio network said late sunday the 
latest confirmed death toll was 46 
about 500 people were injured the west german television 
network zdf said late sunday the norddeutschfunk radio station 
said about 230 people were still hospitalized many with serious 
burns 
a large number has serious burns said police spokesman 
willi hollaender in nearby kaiserslautern 
there are many children among the dead and injured said 
kris kumpf a german medical assistant who helped treat the 
injured the worst part of it is were still trying to find some 
of the parents she said trying to hold back tears 
she said most of the injured had badly burned backs from when 
they turned and tried to run away from the flaming jet 
moore said investigators were still piecing together the 
sequence of events he said it was not certain whether all three 
planes collided at once or whether two first hit each other and the 
third later become involved 
the italian news agency ansa said the planes apparently were 
participating in a difficult heartshaped maneuver when the 
collision occurred 
it said the maneuver involves nine aircraft flying toward the 
runway and then climbing at a certain point in the ascent they 
break into two groups that form giant loops and then pass each 
other in opposite directions a solo flier passes through the 
formation to add drama 
it said the disaster at ramstein apparently happened when the 
two groups of planes were passing each other at about 250 mph 
the agency did not cite its sources but it said the conclusion 
was based on the first examination of films of the crash arriving 
in italy from west germany 
willi hollaender a police spokesman in kaiserslautern told the 
ap that the planes involved were aermacchi mb 339as a twoseat 
attack aircraft that the italian air force also uses for pilot 
training 
officials identified the three pilots killed sunday as lt col 
mario naldini 41 lt col ivo nutarelli 38 and capt giorgio 
alessio 31 
the accident is believed to be the worst air show disaster 
involving spectators in history in september 1982 46 people 
aboard a us army helicopter carrying skydivers crashed during an 
air show in mannheim west germany 
several groups including the environmentalist greens party of 
west germany oppose military air shows because of the potential 
for such accidents 
the crash sparked new calls for a ban on air shows 
the events at ramstein confirm in a really horrible way how 
dangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers said 
walter kolbow a federal lawmaker for the opposition social 
democratic party

the communist leaders of hungary and 
romania held their first summit conference sunday in 11 years 
talks reportedly centered on romanias plan to raze thousands of 
villages populated by ethnic hungarians 
hungarian communist party chief karoly grosz said romanian 
president nicolas ceausescu was receptive to the idea of hungary 
sending a team to romania to examine the village demolition and 
resettlement project 
grosz was interviewed by hungarian television and radio from the 
town of szeged near the romanian border he was returning to 
hungary after more than eight hours of talks with ceausescu in the 
romanian city of arad 25 miles from the frontier 
but grosz indicated relations between the warsaw pact allies are 
still strained saying it had been agreed that consular offices of 
the two countries would not be reopened 
last week hungarian authorities described as a crime against 
humanity ceausescus plan to demolish 7000 of romanias 13000 
villages and to resettle the inhabitants many of them ethnic 
hungarians 
hungarians have long said the estimated 17 million ethnic 
hungarians in romania are discriminated against and the 
announcement by ceausescu in march that the village demolition and 
resettlement project should be completed by the year 2000 drew 
fierce criticism here 
hungary claims the project which would resettle villagers into 
agroindustrial centers wiould destroy ethnic culture and 
traditions 
grosz said the nationality question dominated about one third of 
sundays talks and the resettlement plan was a major question of 
course 
he said his delegation proposed that hungary send a delegation 
made up of local council officials members of parliament and 
communist party workers to look at the resettlement plans and see 
for themselves how the program is shaping up 
grosz indicated progress on the issue of reunification of 
families separated by nationality policies he said more than 
17000 romanians presumably of hungarian orgin have sought refuge 
in hungary 
if there are family reunion requests they the romanians will 
be partners to it grosz said this is something that they 
promised 
he said hungary agreed to drop the issue of reopening consulates 
and cultural centers because of romanias position of principle 
to close every kind of consulate 
following a demonstration by some 50000 people in budapest in 
june ceausescu reacted by closing hungarys consulate in 
clujnapoca in transylvania where many members of the hungarian 
minority live 
grosz said the next highlevel bilateral meeting would be held 
in 1989 there is a lot we dont know about each other and 
ignorance will not broaden ties he said 
the meeting sunday was the first romanianhungarian summit since 
1977 when ceausescu met grosz predecessor janos kadar 
ceausescu who surprised the hungarians thursday with his 
invitation to the talks called them a new beginning that started 
in a positive way according to a hungarian radio broadcast it 
did not elaborate

a tropical storm rolled ashore sunday 
bringing heavy rain and strong winds that destroyed more than a 
dozen mobile homes killing one person and left thousands 
temporarily without power 
just six hours after tropical storm chris became the third named 
storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane season early sunday it moved 
over land and weakened but it still packed enough power to 
devastate trailers in a sparsely populated wooded area about 75 
miles inland from this historic port city 
the winds took a swath probably a half a mile long and a 
quarter of a mile wide said clarendon county fire chief carter 
jones he said one person was killed and another seriously injured 
in a mobile home three miles south of manning and a dozen or more 
trailers were destroyed in a sales lot 
the winds snapped tree limbs across eastern south carolina and 
tornadoes associated with the same weather pattern tore up trees 
and roofs in north carolina 
the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning 
from savannah ga to cape hatteras nc for much of the day by 
6 pm the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression 
located near columbia with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph in 
squalls 
the hurricane center warned of coastal flooding and recommended 
that small craft stay in port from brunswick ga to virginia 
beach va until winds and seas subsided 
rain from the storm was expected to reach as far north as 
northern new jersey southeastern new york and long island by 
monday the weather service in new york city said 
winds measured in gusts up to 44 mph in charleston cut power to 
an estimated 18000 customers in coastal south carolina and 
destroyed one mobile home and overturned another near the community 
of olanta near florence 
the storm which had maximum sustained wind of 50 mph while over 
the ocean rolled over land at 20 mph shortly after noon the 
national hurricane center said 
its such a weak storm theres no eye or anything like 
that said forecaster john townsend of the weather service in 
charleston the only thing were worrying about is some flooding 
due to rainfall and tides 
the weather service said 172 inches of rain fell between 545 
pm and 645 pm in the columbia area and produced standing water 
on roads including interstate 26 that contributed to traffic 
problems and accidents 
forecasters predicted 3 to 5 inches of rain along the storms 
projected track across south carolina and into north carolina 
sheriffs dispatchers said tornadoes uprooted trees damaged 
mobile homes and tore shingles off roofs but no injuries were 
reported in alexander catawba and iredell counties in western 
central north carolina 
theyre not directly associated with chris but the flow 
pattern around the storm brings in moisture from the atlantic and 
thats what causing this kind of thing said bob muller of the 
national weather service at the raleighdurham airport 
damages were estimated as high as 1 million in iredell county 
where wind threw a tractortrailer rig into a building at iredell 
container co in statesville said al warlick a spokesman for the 
state department of crime control and public safety 
a tornado in cumberland county damaged four houses in a 
subdivision and destroyed a produce stand north of fayetteville 
authorities said 
steve vann 21 of goldsboro said he was helping his uncle move 
into a home when a tornado ripped apart percy currins produce 
stand 
i seen it hit the ground about 330 pm the wind got to 
whipping up pretty good clouds moving in a tornadolike motion 
then it quit raining all of a sudden it came out of nowhere 
vann said it sounded just like somebody throwing a match on 
gasoline whoosh 
scattered power outages affected about 12000 south carolina 
electric amp gas co customers in the charleston and beaufort areas 
said becky mcswain a spokeswoman for the utility which serves 
about half the state 
during saturday and into early sunday chris strengthened into a 
tropical storm from a lopsided tropical depression that threatened 
floridas eastern coast depressions are upgraded to tropical 
storms when their maximum sustained wind hits 39 mph and to 
hurricanes when sustained wind blows at least at 74 mph 
on saturday the system drenched the bahamas with about 5 inches 
of rain 
earlier the depression which began forming one week ago sunday 
dumped 66 inches of rain on puerto rico causing mud slides and 
flooding that killed at least three people and damaged more than 
100 homes civil defense officials said 
the last named storm to hit south carolina was tropical storm 
kate in 1985 which came ashore as a hurricane in the florida 
panhandle that storm flooded roads left thousands without power 
and was blamed for at least one death in south carolina

burundis foreign minister said sunday that 
authorities had stopped the violence in that central african 
nation where at least 5000 people were killed in battles between 
rival tribes 
cyprien mbonimpa told reporters there are currently no more 
killings no more bloodshed 
he spoke to reporters after an hourlong meeting with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
mbonimpa replying to a question said burundi would not accept 
an international inquiry into the killings by members of the hutu 
and tutsi tribes that began two weeks ago 
he said he had asked perez de cuellars backing for burundis 
appeal for 15 million in emergency aid with the money to provide 
food and clothing for three months for 100000 people left homeless 
mbonimpa said people displaced inside burundi are returning 
hour by hour to their villages 
more than 40000 people fled into neighoring rwanda to escape 
the massacres 
the hutu and tutsi have been rivals for centuries the hutu form 
a majority in burundi but the tutsi tribe dominates the government 
and army 
mbonimpa said the death toll may be higher than the 5000 
reported last monday by the government but there is no new official 
figure 
the violence began aug 14 in two communities in northern 
burundi according to refugees in rwanda 
they said army units controlled by tutsi officers were sent 
north to restore peace and the soldiers opened fire on the hutu 
mbonimpa repeated a claim by burundis leader maj pierre 
buyoya who last week blamed the massacres on dissident hutus he 
said infiltrated burundi from tanzania and provoked antitutsi 
actions 
when the rebels had already killed thousands the army was 
ordered to intervene he told reporters at the un office in 
geneva he did not elaborate on who the rebels were or where they 
came from 
certainly there were dead people killed by soldiers because 
the army was obliged to use force to repulse the rebels he said 
the armys other mission was to protect and help those who were 
fleeing 
the burundi army is one of the most disciplined armies and 
there never is any loss of control he added to gain control 
of a situation in three days requires a disciplined and well 
controlled army

bankruptcy court officials predict the 
drought will force hundreds of midwestern farmers who might 
otherwise have survived financially to abandon their fields after 
the coming harvest 
after a sharp drop in bankruptcy cases in the first half of 
1988 courts throughout the farm belt expect a surge in bankruptcy 
petition filings in the next six months even with help from the 
huge federal drought assistance bill according to officials in 
iowa south dakota and wisconsin 
the figures looked so promising but with whats happened this 
summer were not going to bump along with this low figure said 
ann manley chief clerk of the us bankruptcy court in madison 
michael duff an assistant to the us department of 
agricultures assistant secretary for economics said farm 
bankruptcies linked to the drought would increase nationwide later 
this year stunting an economic upturn in the farm economy that 
began in late 1987 
last year debts were actually less than receipts and land 
values stabilized but historically anytime you have a drought the 
numbers go up and down duff said there were probably a number 
of farmers on the line having a makeorbreakyou year and they 
probably will go bankrupt or quit 
we dont have any way of knowing how many but it will be a 
national kind of problem duff said 
the madison court which handles bankruptcy petitions involving 
individuals businesses and farms for 44 of wisconsin 72 counties 
received 154 petitions from farmers the first seven months of the 
year that compared with 293 for the same period last year 
since 1985 farm bankruptcies have made up 13 percent to 16 
percent of total cases in the madison district there were 420 in 
1985 511 in 1986 and 448 last year 
ill predict filings will more than double by the end of the 
year ms manley said well be around 400 again 
barbara everly chief clerk of the us bankruptcy court in 
cedar rapids iowa said she expected a 20 percent increase in 
bankruptcies this winter 
youre not only talking about farms but it may be the final 
blow for implement dealers and service stations and the convenience 
stores in those small farm communities that have been on the 
edge said everly 
as in wisconsin everly said farm bankruptcies in iowa so far 
this year have fallen well below previous levels she said climbing 
land values in the state and an improving farm economy had eased 
financial woes 
but now with crops stunted or wiped out and many farmers still 
owing the costs of seed and fertilizer i expect that lenders are 
getting terribly terribly jumpy she said 
ed jesse a university of wisconsin agriculture economist 
called the drought a major setback to an agriculture economy 
that began improving late last year 
a lot of them are just going to have to call it quits jesse 
said 
in south dakota farm bankruptcies were down by almost 78 
percent the first seven months of the year 
pat naylor deputy clerk for the us bankruptcy court in sioux 
falls sd said 61 farm petitions had been filed through july 
compared to 311 for the same period a year ago 
south dakota was among the early states hardest hit by the 
drought 
however judge irvin hoyt of the us bankruptcy court in 
pierre sd said the number of farm bankruptcies would depend on 
the eligibility and timing of federal drought aid to farmers 
president reagan signed the 39 billion drought assistance bill 
aug 11 and the government hopes to begin taking applications by 
oct 1 under the law aid to farmers who lose more than 35 percent 
of their expected harvest will cover 65 percent of that lost 
income for farmers who suffer crop losses of more than 75 percent 
the aid would equal 90 percent of the lost income 
until we know exactly when aid will be available 
particularly for those in bankruptcy who must modify their plans 
we wont know whats going to happen with filings hoyt said 
farmers generally file chapter 11 petitions which grant 
protection from creditors and create a plan for debt payment or 
chapter 12 petitions which were created in 1986 in the family farm 
act 
chapter 12 petitions generally resemble chapter 11 petitions 
but proponents say they give the debtor stronger control over the 
payment schedule and use a trustee generally an attorney to 
administer it 
chapter 11 and 12 debt payment plans can be modified to fit 
unexpected economic troubles and even allow payments to be 
temporarily suspended but the huge financial losses anticipated in 
the drought may require payments to be reduced or suspended for so 
long that creditors might urge liquidation said mark bromley a 
lancaster attorney who handles farm bankruptcies 
creditors would have a strong argument that the normal 
bankruptcy plan simply wont work bromley said 
my greatest concern would be for the people already in 
bankruptcy in some cases payment plans may have to be modified to 
drastically reduce or suspend payments for a year bromley said 
bromley and hoyt also said that next springs operational costs 
for feed fertilizer and other items may be too high for some under 
present plans and reduced income 
buying at higher costs will throw those plans and cash flows 
back into court for modifications bromley said 
bromley said hes had relatively few consultations with farmers 
about financial problems this summer 
i think the reason is its so hard out there so beyond the 
experience of most farmers that they want to wait and see where 
things fall he said

executions are down this year even in 
the nations capital punishment capital as courts finetune 
the laws and deathrow inmates wait to see what effect that will 
have on their cases 
in texas this year only robert streetman has been belted to the 
gurney and executed by injection while eight convicts have been 
put to death nationally last year texas accounted for six of the 
25 us executions and 10 of 18 in 1986 
since the us supreme court ruled the death penalty legal in 
1976 101 inmates have been put to death 27 of them in the lone 
star state 
its kind of like everybody is saying ok lets wait a 
minute said james beathard an inmate on the texas death row 
texas has a great deal to do with it tanya coke research 
director for the naacp legal defense fund said of the lull the 
courts heard major death penalty cases which challenge the 
constitutionality of the texas law and essentially held them up 
this summer however the us supreme court upheld the death 
sentence of donald gene franklin for the 1975 murder of a nurse 
and assistant attorney general bob walt said franklin and others 
will run out of time later this year 
i think youre probably going to see three or four by the end 
of the year walt said franklin is an absolute certainty 
nationwide in the last year many court opinions in death 
penalty cases went against the states walt said 
there seems to be a little bit of finetuning in state 
statutes he said 
in the franklin case defense attorneys argued that the jury 
that voted for the death penalty was prevented from giving full 
consideration to mitigating circumstances or factors suggesting 
life in prison as more appropriate 
during the trial franklins attorneys had suggested the judge 
instruct the jury on how to handle mitigating circumstances but he 
refused 
death penalty opponents now are pinning their hopes on a new 
texas case the us supreme court has agreed to hear attorneys for 
johnny penry contend he should not be executed for a 1979 murder 
because he is mentally retarded 
arguments in the penry case wont be delivered until later this 
year with no immediate ruling likely 
franklin although portrayed as a bad decision was a good 
case said scott howe an attorney with the capital punishment 
clinic at the university of texas law school people got a stay 
on the franklin issue were hoping most people get a stay on penry 
now 
the ruling in the franklin case came eight months after he was 
scheduled to be executed 
on death row inmates are just pleased the issue remains active 
were back eight months now when we were talking about 
franklin said inmate lester bower now were talking about 
penry and we have not even had a test case on it yet 
of execution dates pending in texas walter bells on sept 13 
is considered the most serious bell was convicted of the 1974 
slaying of a port arthur couple 
hes on his second time through the appeals process walt 
said historically he has a greater chance of being executed 
but howe said questions raised in bells appeal are very good 
since they are similar to penrys hes mentally retarded he 
said theres a question if applied to bell whether the texas 
statute is constitutional 
those involved in capital punishment matters agree that 
electionyear politics is really not a factor 
republicans generally prodeath penalty are eager to make it 
a difficult issue on democrats generally antideath penalty 
ms coke said but in terms of real impact on cases no 
death penalty law is complex and constantly evolving and as 
soon as a court hands down a new procedure it seems a new case 
comes along that breaks the mold i think the courts struggles 
with capital punishment attest to human frailty its simply 
impossible to reduce to a legal formula decisions of life and 
death

africanized killer bees are 
spreading north and will arrive in the united states in less than 
two years despite efforts to stop them or alter their behavior 
officials say 
the bees killed one resident of tapachula a town near the 
guatemalan border when a man tripped on an unseen hive they also 
have harassed herds of cattle and made grazing difficult as far as 
650 feet from a hive 
the africanized bees are descendants of african bees that 
escaped during an experiment in brazil they mate with local bees 
spawning new generations that are more aggressive and dangerous to 
handle make less honey and pollinate crops less efficiently 
mexico will be africanized without a doubt it is a fact we 
cannot change said dr martha noemi zapata president of the 
tapachula agricultural association in a recent interview she said 
the bees will continue north as far as the cold allows 
hundreds of hives migrate to the north but we dont know how 
many said beekeeper gil tobias covered from head to toe with 
africanized bees as he demonstrated new safety procedures 
since honey is mexicos second biggest agricultural export after 
milk the invasion has researchers searching for ways to protect 
the industry 
beekeepers here are learning to work in heavy veils boots 
suits and gloves that make them look a bit like astronauts about to 
undertake a space walk they use smoke in an effort to stupefy the 
bees 
researchers also are sneaking into hives to replace africanized 
queen bees with their sweeternatured cousins and are trying to 
saturate some areas with european beehives 
were hoping to dilute the african genetic content said dr 
ernesto ugalde supervisor of several beecontrol centers we can 
do it if we can stabilize the population of european bees 
the africanized bees began their spread in brazil in 1956 when 
specimens of an african bee escaped during an experiment the bees 
started breeding with local bees of european origin creating the 
africanized or killer bee 
they new bees advanced slowly at first but reached mexico in 
december 1986 us and mexican officials tried to stem the tide by 
dangling bee traps from trees and wiping out hives across the 
narrowest point of mexico the isthmus of tehuantepec 
the barrier didnt work 
by the time it was ready the bees had already crossed said 
zapata 
the bees have been spotted in the states of tabasco and 
veracruz the heart of mexicos honey industry 
the bees will be in the united states by 1990 dr gustavo 
rodriguez eres mexican director of a joint usmexican bee 
control program said in an interview in mexico city 
the bees are expected to spread into the southern united states 
but cannot survive cold weather as well as their european cousins 
experts say beekeepers will just have to learn to live with 
killer bees 
aside from the research program in tapachula about 12 miles 
from the guatemalan border in chiapas the southernmost state of 
mexico programs are being conducted in the state of veracruz on 
the gulf of mexico and on the pacific coast in the state of oaxaca 
experts say their best hope is to crossbreed the africanized 
bees with the european honey bee diluting aggressive characterics 
eres said much of the bees aggressiveness has been controlled in a 
crossbreeding experiment 
but more important he said was the bees effect on honey 
production the african bees accumulate less honey than the 
european bees because they spend more time defending their hives 
he said 
the africanized bee simply has a marked defensive instinct 
that makes it easier to irritate and more aggressive when 
bothered eres said 
about 47000 mexican families most of them peasants in areas of 
subsistence farming are in the honey business 
mexico has about 27 million beehives and is the worlds fourth 
largest honey exporter after the united states the soviet union 
and china according to official figures honey exports bring in 
about 50 million a year 
the usmexican control program is run jointly by the us 
department of agriculture and the mexican department of agriculture 
and hydraulic resources it has a budget of about 26 million this 
year eres said

jerry gray the associated press bureau chief in 
nairobi kenya traveled to burundi where at least 5000 people 
were reported killed in fighting between the hutu and tutsi tribes 
here is his story 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the killings began here in lush banana 
groves and behind the walls of neat mud houses with roofs of tin 
and bamboo tiles 
two weeks after the tribes of hutu and tutsi renewed a 
centuriesold blood feud killing thousands and sending tens of 
thousands fleeing sporadic killings continue and scores of 
deserted homes stand like gravemarkers 
the tutsidominated army sent in to restore peace is occupying 
an area that is nearly 90 percent hutu the majority tribe in this 
tiny east african nation 
soldiers with bayonets mounted on their rifles patrol the bush 
or man roadblocks others are camped beneath trees and behind cover 
that also conceals armored personnel carriers 
some string barbed and razor wire while a group of 100 soldiers 
clamber around a crateladen truck to get rations of the local beer 
an uneasy peace has been restored here but with brutal force 
when the army came it couldnt distinguish between the tutsi 
and the hutu said stanislaus baratakara a tutsi and one of the 
few people who has found the courage to return home to restore 
order the army killed whoever was in the place 
baratakara 52 an illiterate peasant farmer lost two sons in 
the violence he had no notion how many other friends and neighbors 
were killed by the army or in the tribal warfare that preceded the 
armys arrival 
but standing saturday outside a firegutted house where he said 
a family of tutsi had been murdered by hutu he said the killings 
had not stopped 
there are some people hiding who come at night to some 
families and take one or two people he said 
a hutu suspected of having participated in a massacre of tutsi 
was killed saturday hours before a group of journalists reached his 
commune baratakara said he said he did not know the killers but 
suspected they were tutsi 
the government has confirmed at least 5000 deaths a count 
based on reports from gravediggers who dumped victims into mass 
graves at undisclosed sites 
but some burundians mostly hutu among the 40000 who fled into 
neighboring rwanda to escape what they say were reprisal killings 
by the army insist that they left behind tens of thousands of dead 
hutu refugees in rwanda many of them with bullet or knife 
wounds have told of soldiers herding people into houses and then 
shooting them or using helicopters to firebomb villagers running 
toward rwanda 
at the regional hospital in kirundo the provincial capital 
about 40 to 60 patients most of them tutsi tell similar tales of 
hutu vengeance 
the tutsi say hutu neighbors who opposed the killings or refused 
to participate were turned on by fellow hutu 
army medics and civilian nurses are treating the wounded mostly 
women and children normally there are three doctors at the 
hospital the only one serving the 371000 people of this northern 
province 125 miles from the capital bujubura 
the physicians all hutu fled when the fighting began said 
nurse francoise nihorimbere 
the hutu account for 84 percent of burundis 5 million people 
but the tutsi about 15 percent control the military and the 
government 
ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century when 
the tutsi a tall nilotic people migrated south from ethiopia 
and imposed feudal rule on the short stocky hutu 
burundi is one of the worlds most densely populated countries 
and competition for space in the marylandsized nation is the cause 
of much of the ethnic animosity 
why the latest bloodshed began is not known although rumors and 
speculation abound hutu refugees in rwanda tell of arrests of hutu 
or speak of unannounced army maneuvers that prompted fears of an 
impending tutsiled massacre the government blames exiled hutu for 
the trouble 
in the past it has taken little to set off killings here in 
1972 hutu using spears and knives killed hundreds of tutsi in an 
attempt to overthrow the government 
the coup attempt was crushed and the tutsi retaliated by killing 
100000 to 300000 hutu including most of the tribes 
intelligentsia 
but burundians have lived in relative peace since maj gen 
pierre byoya deposed fellow tutsi jeanbaptiste bagaza in a 
bloodless coup in december 1987 
the new wave of killings caught the government and the tutsi 
population offguard 
on sunday aug 14 there was a meeting of those hutu who 
wanted to attack tutsi families baratakara said when they 
started the massacre they burned each house of the tutsi they had 
long knives machetes and spears 
baratakara said the attackers were his hutu neighbors and he saw 
no outsiders 
he his wife and four of their six children ran into the safety 
of the bush after they saw two of baratakaras sons ages 18 and 
30 hacked down 
they were killed and their bodies eaten by dogs baratakara 
said 
about the same time as the trouble started in ngeta killing 
started in marangara 15 miles to the south in neighboring ngozi 
province 
although violence broke out in several other communes the signs 
of carnage are most visible here in ngeta 
rows of houses built with a thick brown mud from the 
hillsides have been gutted by fire windows have been smashed and 
doors broken in 
clay cooking pots are overturned or broken in the yards outside 
the houses 
cattle graze unattended while thin dogs scavenge for food 
at a simple threeroom house of one unidentified family the 
cool hardpacked mud floor is littered with debris seeds are 
scattered throughout the house 
in one bedroom a bed has been overturned and straw sleeping 
mats trampled into bits in another the floor is littered with 
school notebooks childrens clothes a sickletype knife and glass 
from broken window panes 
a huge cooking pot lies near the door as if it had been used in 
a vain attempt to bar entry 
baratakara said the family living there was killed 
baratakara his wife and their two youngest children returned to 
their ransacked home when the army arrived about 24 hours after 
the killings started 
the other two surviving children are among 3500 mostly tutsi 
refugees who have congregated in the commercial center of the 
commune afraid to return to their homes despite regular army 
patrols 
hundreds of hutu in the area are unaccounted for many are 
feared dead though some may be among the 40000 refugees in rwanda 
rwanda has enough trouble finding room for its 61 million 
people and the refugees present a major problem 
we are trying to help them frederick karangwa governor of 
the rwandan province where the refugees have gathered said last 
week but they are overwhelming us

threatened homes in rural areas 
forest also burned in parts of northern california and 
washington state

helicopters and crews to help fight the blazes that have charred 
more than 400000 acres of the park about 35 helicopters have been 
working on the yellowstone complex of fires in yellowstone and 
grand teton parks and the adjoining bridgerteton shoshone and 
targhee national forests 
dave poncin a firefighting commander in wyoming said he would 
like to have another 15 to 20 helicopters most military copters 
are too big for firefighting 
military pilots are good but theyre not bush pilots what we 
need are oilfield pilots people who fly in the mountains a lot and 
are familiar with this kind of terrain he said at a news 
briefing were looking of course for the best in the business 
and theyre probably not available so thats where were at 
a shift in wind direction in yellowstone created a 250acre spot 
fire about five miles from old faithful the parks most popular 
attraction where nearby structures earlier were threatened by 
flames 
linda miller a fire information officer said the spot fire was 
created when wind fanned flames on the southern end of the 
114000acre north fork fire 
crews worked to build a containment line around the blaze by 
hand and were aided by an air tanker and the buildings around the 
geyser were not threatened saturday morning miller said 
near cooke city mont three ranches were evacuated saturday 
because of a threat from the leading edge of the clover mist fire 
forest service crews used bulldozers and hand crews to clear a 
40footwide swath for a backfire hoping to cut off the giant fire

a twa jet carrying 68 people made a belly landing 
saturday at ohare international airport after its landing gear 
failed and at least seven people were injured while evacuating on 
chutes authorities said 
nobody was seriously hurt said officials at the four nearby 
hospitals where the injured were taken 
five of them including a 102yearold chicago woman were 
treated and released while two were still getting care late 
saturday one for a twisted ankle and the other for knee pains 
officials said 
twa flight 524 en route from st louis to chicago was 
approaching midway airport shortly before 4 pm when the pilot 
noticed landing gear problems said donald morrison a twa 
spokesman in st louis 
the captain was unable to lower the main landing gear 
morrison said after following normal cockpit procedures trying 
to lower it manually he proceeded to ohare field which has 
longer runways and more emergency facilities than midway 
fire engines ambulances and other emergency vehicles converged 
on the runway which was sprayed with foam to ease the landing at 
443 pm in foggy rainy conditions 
it came in beautifully it didnt skid very far at all said 
patrolman jeff nagle who witnessed the landing it was a perfect 
landing on its belly there was no gas leak or nothing 
passenger cassandra walker 22 of hazelcrest ill said that 
when the crew announced the landing gear was not working some 
people aboard started crying she said the mood on board was very 
hysterical after the landing with tears of relief and happiness 
she said at one point the pilot of the boeing 727 attempted to 
relieve tension by joking about a successful plane landing in 
honolulu with no top so he could do it with no bottom 
the twa pilot was referring to an april incident in which an 
aloha airlines pilot landed a plane safely after an 18foot section 
of fuselage tore away killing one person during a flight from 
hilo hawaii to honolulu 
the plane saturday was carrying 62 passengers and six 
crewmembers morrison said 
the cause of the landing gear problem had not been determined 
and federal aviation officials will be investigating morrison said

a tropical depression 50 miles east of miami 
drenched parts of the bahamas saturday and hurricane experts 
predicted the poorly organized system would turn north sunday 
forecasters said east coast residents from the middle of florida 
to north carolina should monitor progress of the system 
if it stays close to the coast its going to be difficult for 
it to become better organized than it is now national hurricane 
center forecaster gil clark said the biggest threat is over the 
eastern bahamas where they have these squalls 
the hurricane center canceled a tropical storm watch for the 
bahamas late saturday and rain was expected to taper off overnight 
early sunday the system was 40 miles east of palm beach moving 
to the northwest at 10 to 15 mph it was expected to turn to the 
north over the next 12 to 24 hours maximum sustained winds in the 
depression were near 35 mph 
it never has been organized clark said its kind of 
lopsided all the bad weathers on the east side were not 
getting anything on the west side we dont know why sometimes 
that happens 
the depression caused at least three deaths and forced hundreds 
of evacuations due to swollen rivers and mudslides as it moved 
across the northern edge of the caribbean on friday no injuries or 
flooding were reported saturday 
up to 5 inches of rain was expected in the bahamas as the 
depression the seventh of the 1988 atlantic ocean hurricane 
season crossed the islands 
its pretty miserable over here said roger carron coowner 
of the tribune in nassau were having a lot of rain its across 
to andros in other words the whole country seems to be 
blanketed 
in cuba the official news agency la prensa said friday that 
civil defense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousands 
of people to higher ground 
the depression which began forming last sunday in the central 
atlantic dumped 66 inches of rain on puerto rico in a 24hour 
period ending thursday and then dropped 5 inches more on the 
dominican republic 
two men and a 12yearold boy were killed in puerto rico in two 
separate accidents wednesday and more than 100 homes around the 
island were damaged by flooding civil defense officials in puerto 
rico reported they also reported mudslides and damaged highways 
and bridges 
if the lopsided depression should attain tropicalstorm 
strength it would be called chris two other tropical storms have 
developed during the season which runs from june 1 to nov 30 but 
no hurricanes 
depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when their 
maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph and become hurricanes when 
maximum sustained winds hit 74 mph

the man who designed the roller coaster 
that many consider the nations most terrifying had to get 
permission to work on it and has never ridden his creation his 
doctor wont let him 
about the time i got started on it i had to have open heart 
surgery said william l cobb 70 creator of the cyclone at 
riverside park in agawam my doctor said it would be all right to 
work on it if i didnt get too excited about anything 
rated best in the nation by american coaster enthusiasts when it 
opened five years ago the cyclone is still the favorite of many 
coaster buffs although it is neither the largest nor the fastest 
what it lacks in height and speed it makes up for in 
bonejarring turns says paul l ruben editor of rollercoaster 
the official magazine of ace a nonprofit group of 1700 coaster 
fans he calls it the most fearsome in memory 
what youre facing here is a major league throwing machine 
said ruben 51 an optical engineer from penfield ny with this 
coaster you win if you dont get thrown out of your seat 
the cyclones cars swoop down a 112foot drop at a 54degree 
angle into a turn at 60 mph the ride then takes what ruben calls 
fiendish boomerang twists along 3200 feet of track speeding 
down two more extremely steep hills and throwing riders up down 
and against the sides of their seats at least nine times 
its weird to see the ground first and then the sky said 
teddy witt 11 of tolland conn as he waited in line for his 
second ride of the day 
although ruben officially rates the cyclone no 2 behind the 
beast at kings island ohio the highest longest and fastest 
coaster in the country he says the coaster at agawam outside 
springfield has no peer in terror 
every time i was airborne the thing would change direction and 
try to pull the seat out from under me he said 
during a test run with sandbags a few hours before a 1983 news 
conference it bucked a few sandbags off 
but the coaster has been the site of only one fall by a rider 
who suffered a fractured hip in 1983 witnesses said he unfastened 
his safety restraints and stood up a few months later one of the 
trains failed to stop and ran into the back of another injuring 
seven people 
park officials say there have been no injuries since however 
ride safety is almost a religion among park operators ruben 
said 
maintenance crews walk the coasters rails every morning to 
clear and check them and testrun the cars every day with sandbags 
its operators say they argue several times daily with riders who 
want to take along children too short to be held back by the safety 
bar there is a strictly enforced rider height minimum of 54 inches 
people kids too they threaten us and they try to bribe us 
said operator don shunney 19 
cobb said the cyclone was among the hardest coasters he has 
designed in the last 20 years because of its tight space a tight 
construction deadline and the parks orders to create a ride that 
would scare the daylights out of riders 
they wanted people to think while they were riding it my 
gosh ill never get off this thing alive he said 
since the cyclone cobb also designed le monstre in montreal 
with two tracks that race against each other and with a 100foot 
twisting drop toward the st lawrence river 
cobb isnt all that upset that doctors wont let him ride his 
creations 
i never was a good rider he admits i was too critical 
if it didnt do exactly what i thought it should do i would be 
disappointed

a 4258pound tomato that won a statewide 
competition and a 1000 prize for minnie zaccaria of long branch 
would have been bigger if this summers heat hadnt ripened it so 
fast she said 
i knew it was going to be big you kind of tell when its on 
the vine what it will weigh ms zaccaria said saturday 
ms zaccaria who won the 1986 championship said this summers 
hot weather forced her to pick the tomato weeks before the contest 
and keep it in her refrigerator 
i really felt it would have been a lot bigger the heat forced 
all the fruit to ripen sooner than it would have she said 
theres no trick to growing large tomatoes she said anybody 
can do it with the proper soil water and food it takes those 
three things in the right proportions 
ms zaccaria said she set out 75 tomato plants this summer but 
doesnt plan to grow that many tomatoes next year because of the 
work involved 
two other long branch residents daniel e parottino and his 
wife sylvia grew the second and thirdplace winners in the 11th 
annual new jersey championship tomato weighin parottinos 
3896pound tomato earned him 500 while mrs parottinos weighed

nearly two months after a judge refused to 
stop a 27yearold mother of three from having an abortion which 
her husband vehemently opposed christine and timothy anderson are 
back together 
although they havent budged from their positions she supports 
abortion rights and hes antiabortion they say their 3yearold 
marriage now is better than ever 
i respect his beliefs and he respects mine mrs anderson 
said 
when she learned she was pregnant a fourth time she said their 
marriage was troubled and they had a mountain of debts 
i kept looking at my kids she said i felt i had to have 
an abortion so i could better provide for them 
in addition they had agreed not to have more children the 
birth of their third child last year was difficult so anderson 
underwent a vasectomy but it failed and she became pregnant three 
months later 
anderson sued and obtained a temporary court order barring his 
wife from having an abortion 
andersons attorney rodney brodin argued that a mans right to 
have a family should be balanced with a womans right to have an 
abortion 
but on the morning of july 8 mrs anderson waited at the 
womens health center in duluth for the judges decision on whether 
to extend his order until the case could go to trial 
i was scared either way she said i was scared to go 
through with the abortion procedure and scared that i wouldnt be 
able to legally go through with it 
when word arrived that the judge had not extended the order the 
abortion was performed before her husband could file an appeal she 
was two months pregnant 
its hard enough to have an abortion she said its even 
harder to go through with it when the world knows about it and you 
have to go out on the street afterwards 
at times anderson 34 has doubted whether he did the right 
thing 
i did what i thought was the right thing to do he said i 
oppose abortion because of my religious beliefs and because i have 
always thought abortion was bad 
after all the public attention he said he and his wife want to 
put the episode behind them 
i wish it had never happened he said i want to forget 
about the whole thing and put it in the past

leftwing opposition leaders began 
mapping new strategies sunday for sharing political power after the 
death of president mohammed zia ulhaq 
leading british newspapers meanwhile reported that pakistan 
concluded sabotage was to blame for the aug 17 plane crash that 
killed zia the us ambassador to pakistan and many of the 
countrys top generals 
the sunday times of london said pakistani officials believe zia 
was killed by an international conspiracy involving pakistani 
activists in britain it said the government wants to question five 
pakistani nationals in britain the newspaper gave no attribution 
the sunday telegraph quoted unidentified sources in washington 
as saying the pakistani investigation concluded the plane was shot 
down by a missile the newspaper did not say what kind of missile 
was involved or who fired it 
the observer newspaper said pakistani officials were convinced 
indias intelligence service was to blame it quoted unidentified 
highlevel pakistani sources 
the pakistani government has not made any official statements on 
the cause of the crash although individual officials have said 
they believe it was sabotage us and british diplomats in 
islamabad the pakistani capital have said they are not aware of 
any initial conclusions in the pakistani inquiry 
in pakistan the movement for the restoration of democracy a 
nineparty opposition alliance planned to meet sunday and monday 
in the southern city of karachi to plot strategy 
on saturday in the western city of quetta an estimated 20000 
opposition supporters waved banners and chanted antizia slogans as 
speakers called for a neutral caretaker government to guide the 
nation to a return to civilian rule in general elections scheduled 
for nov 16 
several of zias civilian backers have been appointed to a 
caretaker cabinet 
as chief of the army zia shared power with a civilian 
government for only three of his eleven years in power but his 
replacement as army chief gen aslam beg said last week the 
militarys role would be to ensure an orderly transition to 
democracy 
leaders at the rally praised begs intentions but called on 
acting president ghulam ishaq khan to replace the caretaker 
government with neutral people until the november polls 
if ishaq khan wants peace and harmony in the country and 
cooperation of the political leaders he should immediately do away 
with the present ministers said abdul wali khan leader of the 
socialist awami national party 
unless this is done no politicans will extend any 
continuation of zias dictatorship a rule of tyranny and 
oppression which lasted 11 years wali khan said 
he called on ishaq khan to come out squarely for partybased 
elections instead of nonparty polls ordered by zia before his 
death 
ishaq khan a former senate chairman told reporters at his 
first news conference he would follow the constitution which 
reconizes a partybased parliamentary system 
but he said he would let the supreme court rule on opposition 
petitions to open the november elections to all comers 
opposition alliance leaders said they expected to win seats in a 
new national assembly but there are no reliable figures in 
pakistan on party memberships 
the alliances largest member benazir bhuttos pakistan 
peoples party is considered the nations largest party but the 
party and its alliance partners boycotted the only elections held 
under zias rule in 1985 because candidates were allowed to run 
only as individuals 
the sunday times said that because pakistan has no extradition 
treaty with britain it was approaching the british embassy in 
islamabad with a request that five pakistanis suspected of a role 
in the plane crash be sent back as a special favor 
the newspaper said at least three previous attempts to 
assassinate zia involved pakistanis in britain it identified six 
pakistanis who it said were either involved in the attempts or 
wanted zia dead 
the newspaper said it spoke to five of them four denied 
involvement in zias death while the fifth who admitted being 
involved in previous attempts said he could not comment the paper 
said 
three of the five said they would have killed the president 
willingly the newspaper said

the growth of government power to tax and 
regulate may be in its twilight years as modern technology 
makes it easier for businesses to move from place to place 
according to a private study 
richard b mckenzie an economics professor at clemson 
university in south carolina said computers facsimile machines 
satellites and other technologies have enabled businesses to 
respond to government intrusion by going elsewhere 
mckenzie conducted his study for the washingtonbased cato 
institute a policy analysis and research organization which 
generally follows a libertarian philosophy of encouraging the least 
possible government intervention in human affairs 
capital is being freed from the strict confines of arbitrary 
national boundaries he wrote as a consequence the power of 
government to tax and regulate may be in its twilight years 
the study said that in the past manufacturers historically 
concentrated their operations in fixed industrial centers the 
costs of relocating factories was high so governments could impose 
taxes and regulations without worrying about capital flight 
as a result governments grew steadily larger and more complex 
he said 
all that has changed as electronic technology tied the world 
more closely together economically and geographic boundaries were 
erased mckenzie said 
the computer that once filled a room can now sit on someones 
lap the textile loom once the size of a car is no larger than a 
birdbath company records have been transferred from large file 
cabinets onto tiny electronic chips 
mckenzie said the difficulty and cost of longdistance 
communications in the past forced businesses to stay close to one 
another 
today it is cheap and easy for a business executive to call up 
on a computer screen the competitive bids for a job that can be 
performed as easily in st louis as in camden sc or 
trincomalee sri lanka 
mckenzie said managers can effortlessly shift plans and designs 
from place to place and transfer financial capital from one country 
to another at the press of a computer button 
in doing do modern managers can escape the reckless authority 
of government to regulate and control he wrote and in doing 
so they force legislators to think carefully about the economic as 
well as the political constraints on their governing roles 
mckenzie said that while government is not getting smaller in 
absolute terms there is evidence of a slowdown in growth of 
government he said us government spending has grown more slowly 
than the gross national product in recent years 
similar trends are occurring in japan west germany britain and 
china he said 
government competition to stabilize or lower tax rates extends 
beyond these industrial giants to many smaller countries including 
singapore south korea the philippines indonesia turkey 
jamaica colombia bolivia mexico grenada botswana ciskei 
mauritius india and israel 
mckenzie said governments can be expected to react to their 
diminishing power with rhetorical bashing of competitors like 
japan and south korea and efforts to conceal the costs of new 
programs by such tactics as shifting to businesses the 
responsibility for such programs as child care and health insurance 
nonetheless mckenzie concludes that the world will likely be 
beset with an enormous power of government to tax and regulate for 
as long as can be imagined

a private auto safety group using tread wear 
data the transportation department doesnt publicize said sunday 
that a 15inch general radial tire was the longest lasting in 
government mileage tests 
topping a list prepared by the center for auto safety was the 
general 15inch ameri classic with a tread wear rating of 350 
meaning it should get 70000 miles of use under average driving 
conditions 
the worst mileage performers among the 111 radial tire models 
tested were the general xp 2000z g the goodrich ta r and r1 and 
yokohamas 60 and 70 a001ra008r all had ratings of 50 or 10000 
miles of use 
as it released its own list the center renewed its demand for 
the departments national highway traffic safety administration to 
publish a buying guide publicizing tire wear ratings for the 
benefit of consumers 
the draft of such a guide similar to the environmental 
protection agencys annual gasoline mileage ratings for new car 
models was prepared under the carter administration but was never 
published 
when president reagan took office in 1981 the department and 
the tire industry tried to abolish the tread wear grading program 
but were thwarted in 1984 by the us court of appeals 
they did reinstate the program but all they have done is 
comply with the minimum requirements of the law said clarence 
ditlow safety director of the nonprofit center 
the difference is that epa publicizes its results so that 
consumers know what their tax dollars are paying for and the 
transportation department hides its results 
jeff miller nhstas deputy administrator said his agency has 
no obligation to publish what he called consumer information 
to call it a tempest in a teapot would overstate the matter 
miller said we do everything the law requires and then some 
we have a very good brochure telling consumers what they 
should look for in tires miller said what this group wants 
isnt safety information but more consumer information more 
heavyhanded federal regulation 
donald g brotzman chairman of the tire industry safety 
council which has opposed publication of the tread wear ratings 
said the federal uniform tire quality grading system was never 
intended to provide consumers a play the numbers guide 
the tread wear grade is not a guarantee that a tire will last 
a prescribed number of miles brotzman said it is a 
comparative rating of a tires wear rate when tested under 
controlled conditions on a specified government test course 
he said the safety centers report overlooks the significance of 
a tires traction and temperature resistance ratings the center 
listed neither data 
the center said the mileage data showed all 17 tire companies 
involved in the tests had good and bad performers 
for example it said the goodyear double eagle had a 260 rating 
52000 miles of wear while the goodyear eagle gt s had only a 
100 rating or 20000 miles 
with that information ditlow said consumers could compare 
tread wear ratings with tire prices and figure out how much each 
costs per mile of use 
using manufacturerrecommended retail prices the center 
calculated that goodyears 13inch tiempo priced at 4795 and 
with a tread wear rating of 170 costs 165 per 1000 miles 
michelins xa4 model at 4790 but with a tread wear rating of 
310 costs 80 cents per 1000 miles the center said 
the government requires tire makers to mold into sidewalls the 
tread wear ratings along with letter grades a b or c on the 
traction and temperature resistance of each tire model 
a tire graded a on traction will stop on a wet road in the 
shortest distance while one graded c will have the poorest 
traction for temperature resistance a grade of a means the tire 
will run cooler than one graded b or c and is less likely to blow 
out or show tread separation

the campaign of michael dukakis concerned by 
george bushs surge in the polls is under increasing pressure to 
take a more aggressive stance in the presidential contest and the 
candidate himself is suggesting he might do just that 
democratic strategists in and out of the dukakis campaign 
expressed growing concern last week that bush had seized control of 
the debate and that dukakis message was either too vague or being 
obscured by bushs forceful attacks on dukakis and the media focus 
on the vice presidents coice of indian sen dan quayle as his 
running mate 
while dukakis frequently denounces negative campaigning he 
hinted strongly saturday that he was nearing the point where he 
would return bushs salvos which range from attacks on dukakis 
patriotism and record on crime issues to jokes about his height 
remember 1982 its ed king all over again dukakis said 
saturday night on a flight from washington to western massachusetts 
where he was spending the weekend before a twoday gubernatorial 
visit to the region 
king was the man who knocked dukakis out of office in 1978 only 
to lose four years later in a rematch that was considered one of 
the nastiest and most aggressive campaigns in state history 
its getting the juices out early dukakis said in 1982 
king was on with negative television on me beginning in february i 
mean nonstop never got off every single week bang bang bang 
bang 
did it hurt sure it hurt but at the appropriate point 
people i think had a sense that enough is enough you come back 
and basically you make the needed adjustments 
just what those adjustments will be this year remains unclear 
but there has been according to campaing aides virtually daily 
debate over whether dukakis should adopt a more agressive posture 
the aides speaking privately say dukakis has resisted most 
attempts to get him to respond faster and feistier to the bush 
criticisms instead he has continued to stress his message of 
economic opportunity and will continue that effort this week with 
two economic speeches during his state trip 
with the exception of an economic speech he delivered after 
winning the aflcio endorsement last week and a sharply worded 
attack on reaganbush antidrug efforts the following day dukakis 
message has been largely lost during the focus on the republican 
national convention the quayle selection and the bushquayle 
attacks on dukakis positions on defense crime the pledge of 
allegiance and gun control 
the other stories have tended to obscure the message that 
weve tried to get out said dukakis issues adviser thomas 
herman well keep talking about our message and we think it will 
begin to stick once some of the clutter and stage or negative 
campaigning ends 
dukakis speaking to reporters on the flight recalled that john 
f kennedy and lyndon johnson got bogged down with congressional 
duties after the 1960 democratic convention but bounced back to 
win seemingly a reference to the time he is forced to dedicate to 
being governor 
but with bush surging and labor day on the horizon dukakis 
plans to cut his statehouse time to one day a week and in another 
effort to reinvigorate his effort his campaign is preparing to 
unleash a round of television advertising 
after labor day youll seen the real fight said dukakis 
strategist chuck campion 
dukakis and aides also blame talk that their campaign is 
floundering on the media which reports that bush is mounting an 
aggressive campaign and translates that into a stalled dukakis 
effort 
long campaigns tend to be like this said dukakis consultant 
thomas kiley you move in and out of phases where one candidate 
is being more specific and more engaged 
in the dukakis campaign engaged is the word for aggressive 
a term the governors aides are quick to differentiate from 
nasty a label they have pinned on bush 
well be running against mr bushs record said herman 
in the areas where mr bush has a record like drugs and trade 
he has failed 
in seizing the debate bush has focused on a dukakis program 
that until early this year allowed firstdegree murderers out on 
furlough and the governors 1977 veto of legislation that would 
have required massachusetts teachers to lead students in the pledge 
of allegiance dukakis veteod it after being advised it was 
unconstitutional bush has said he would sign the measure leading 
dukakis to say bush is unfit for the presidency is he would sign 
unconstitutional legislation 
this contest is not about which one of us is the most 
patriotic dukakis said saturday were both good patriots we 
both love our country 
with statements like that dukakis hopes to show he is trying to 
keep the high ground and will credit bush if he thinks credit is 
due but dukakis also has a history of firing back when he believes 
he has come under undue attack 
in 1982 for example dukakis was under harsh attack from king 
in the weeks leading up to a televised debate before the program 
began dukakis was asked to check his microphone and rattled off 
figures about increasing crime during the king administration the 
move startled king and he floundered through the debate as dukakis 
assailed him for running a corrupt administration dukakis under 
attack from missouri rep richard gephardt during the presidential 
primaries also aired an ad noting gephardts flip flops on a 
number of issues 
dukakis and his aides also have raised questions about bushs 
judgment choosing not to directly attack quayle instead 
questioning whether the 41yearold senator with an undistinguished 
congressional record is qualified as dukakis said saturday to 
step in as president the next day if needed 
senior dukakis adviser kirk odonnell promised those efforts 
would continue and that dukakis would make new proposals after 
labor day 
the candidate himself predicting he would rebound soon smiled 
and simply said its only august

iraq said sunday that iranian troops fired 
shots and set up new radar and observation posts last week in 
violation of a 9dayold truce in the persian gulf war 
iran accused iraq of undermining the peace talks in geneva by 
claiming sovereignty over the disputed shattalarab waterway and 
said the talks may drag on for years 
the commander of the un observer forces monitoring the truce 
said the ceasefire was holding but that more time was needed to 
finish plotting the exact location of the front line 
the official iraqi news agency said more than a dozen iranian 
violations were reported to the un peacekeepers between tuesday 
and friday neither iran nor the observer force commented on the 
claims 
in the northern region of kurdistan the iranians set up two 
radar positions manned by three iranian officers not far from 
iraqi troops the agency said it said appropriate measures were 
taken to eliminate the two positions and push the enemy back but 
did not elaborate 
at the southern end of the front iranian soldiers fired shots 
but un observers intervened to stop the iranian violations and 
returned two advancing iranians to their positions the agency 
said 
in other parts of the front the iranians set up barricades 
fired a machine gun flew helicopters near iraqi positions and set 
up other radar and observation posts the agency said 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus quoted deputy foreign minister javad mansouri as saying 
iraq continues to have designs on irans territorial integrity 
irna quoted mansouri as saying the iraqi delegation in geneva 
is underming the talks by bringing up irrelevant and 
objectionable topics such as iraqs claim of sovereignty of the 
arvand river irans name for the shattalarab 
he stressed that tehran considers the 1975 algiers treaty which 
defined the border between the two countries as valid the treaty 
granted iran control of the eastern half of the waterway which is 
iraqs only outlet to the sea 
iraqi president saddam hussein who considered the treaty a 
humiliation for baghdad tore up the accord during a televised 
speech in september 1980 
mansouri said the negotiations in geneva were going so slowly 
that they might drag on for years to come 
in baghdad the head of the peacekeeping force maj gen slavko 
jovic of yugoslavia told a news conference that the ceasefire 
is operational the situation along the border is generally calm 
some minor problems and questions we are resolving through 
negotiations and enjoying very good help through the understanding 
of both parties jovic said 
he refused to say what the minor problems were but indicated 
there had been no confirmed major violations of the ceasefire that 
took hold aug 20 
jovic said an iraqi report last week that an iranian sniper 
killed an iraqi soldier was unconfirmed but was being 
investigated 
he said the roughly 300 un observers on the ground were in the 
process of determining the positions held by both sides when 
fighting halted in the nearly 8yearold war 
under a plan of action set out by un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar withdrawal to the prewar border is due at a 
later stage 
defining the border is a key factor in the current peace talks 
between iranian and iraqi leaders 
jovic confirmed the death of a danish major identified by other 
sources as steen prebenandersen un officials said the major 
apparently suffered a heat stroke along the sweltering central 
front aug 23 at about 2 pm and was quickly hospitalized by the 
iraqis 
the iraqi agency ina said prebenandersens body was taken to 
baghdad airport on sunday on its way back to denmark

folks who live in michael dukakis 
favorite summer spot are divided over how well their isolated 
hamlet in a valley of the berkshire hills would bear up if it 
becomes a presidential retreat 
im too old and our little town is too peaceful for this 
said carolyn canon 77 a republican resident of the town the 
democratic presidential nominee and state governor has declared his 
preferred place for respites from politics 
tyringham has no school christmas lights still adorn the fire 
station the appalachian trail cuts through the center of the 
hamlet with barely a notice 
dukakis hideaway is a modest onestory white ranch with a 
small guest cottage and backyard pool on the edge of the hamlet 
that has about as many yeararound residents as there are days in 
the year it belongs to his fatherinlaw harry ellis dickson 
associate conductor of the boston pops 
i dont really think we have anything to worry about said 
betty jean cernik the town tax collector for 27 years its a 
long way from tyringham to the white house but the majority of 
people in town dread the thought of him being here and the tourists 
and secret service and all 
tacked on the wall next to the postal boxes in a corner of the 
town library beneath a thank you note to townsfolk from a 
recent widow was a local newspaper story about tyringhams 
possibilities as a presidential retreat the clipping enlivened the 
morning for some of librarian irma clarks postal customers 
oh my god said one elderly women whose family has lived 
in the valley for six generations tyringham will be on the map 
and its starting already dont you dare put my name in the 
paper 
all i can say is here goes another voter for republican 
contender george bush said a young mother rushing out the door 
with her mail who also declined to give her name 
i just cant understand the reaction said mary hale who as 
chairman of the board of selectmen also serves as chief of 
tyringhams fourmember parttime police force people are just 
being ridiculous 
hes been coming here for years and it never bothered them 
before i run meetings with him every month in boston and he always 
asks about the town and says how much he wished he was there 
said ms hale who is also president of the massachusetts municipal 
association 
he is a dear person a lovely person and an asset to the 
village she said im sure no one even noticed the other 
presidents who stayed here 
the 249yearold town is no stranger to the rich and famous 
presidents grover cleveland and william taft were summer residents 
and mark twain gave the library a complete set of his books after 
spending the summer of 1903 here nat king coles widow is a 
longtime resident as are a few soap opera stars television 
producers and writers 
dukakis is a familiar sight jogging on back roads and riding 
around in a beatup dodge said dairy farmer charles slater 71 
he comes here for privacy and i let him have it theres no 
fanfare with the guy people respect privacy here and dont make no 
big fuss said slater whose crystal brooks farm has been in his 
family for eight generations 
i just hope its not like it was with the queen said his 
wife elizabeth recalling the impact queen wilhelmina of the 
netherlands had on the neighboring town of lee when she and her 
family fled there to escape the nazis during world war ii 
the town was overrun by the fbi and the other men president 
roosevelt sent to guard her mrs slater said you couldnt 
even get into the stores to shop

the longsmouldering nuclear arms race in 
south asia is being restrained by strategic and political factors 
opening the way for limited nonproliferation arrangements 
involving india pakistan and possibly china according to a senate 
study published sunday 
the report by the senate foreign relations committee staff 
concludes that despite their advanced atomic energy programs 
neither india nor pakistan has chosen to undertake an overt nuclear 
weapons project 
the study says india which detonated a nuclear explosive device 
in 1974 leads pakistan in nuclear expertise command of nuclear 
weapons technology and access to fissionable material 
the report concludes that india could produce a dozen to 18 
nuclear weapons a year and that pakistan is capable of 
manufacturing only one to three such weapons annually 
prepared by peter w galbraith a south asia expert on the 
committee staff the report says both pakistan and india see 
strategic disadvantages in the general spread of nuclear weapons in 
south asia 
it says this provides an incentive for each to take steps to 
keep the region free of nuclear weapons 
for pakistan a subcontinental arms race is a race its sure 
to lose the report said pakistan cannot match indias nuclear 
production capabilities and would face annihilation by india in a 
hypothetical nuclear exchange between the two 
for its part india has little to fear from a conventionally 
armed pakistan but that a nucleararmed pakistan could inflict 
major damage the study said 
it noted that prominent pakistani politicians have adopted 
positions against nuclear weapons the report said there is no 
indication that the aug 17 plane explosion that killed president 
mohammed zia ulhaq will produce any change in pakistans nuclear 
policies 
us relations with pakistan and india often have been strained 
over nuclear issues although washingtons concern over nuclear 
proliferation at times has been overshadowed by attention to other 
regional problems 
the successful implementation of the geneva accords for a 
soviet withdrawal from afghanistan may again make nonproliferation 
the top us priority in the region the report said 
indias concern about chinas nuclear arsenal must be taken into 
account in any comprehensive arrangement to keep south asia free of 
nuclear weapons the study said 
a nuclear weapons free zone that included parts of china and 
the indian ocean as well as south asia might be achievable it 
said 
the report says both india and pakistan have ample means to 
deliver nuclear warheads to their targets and that india has the 
advantage over its neighbor 
the study notes that india recently successfully testfired a 
shortrange surfacetosurface missile called the prithvi which may 
be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead

several months ago two border patrol agents 
were lying in ambush on the muddy banks of the rio grande river 
when they saw two men wading through the water from mexico 
the agents called on them to stop the two pulled out weapons a 
gunbattle ensued and one of the aliens was killed the other fled 
dropping 40 pounds of marijuana 
the incident recounted by texas border patrol agent george 
gunnoe underlines the closely intertwined tasks of interdicting 
drugs and illegal aliens 
smuggling aliens and drugs go handinhand said hugh j 
brien chief of the border patrol which is the paramilitary 
enforcement arm of the immigration and naturalization service 
last year the agency intercepted more than 60 percent of the 
drugs caught along the southwestern border 209281 pounds of 
marijuana 12813 pounds of cocaine and some 50 lbs of heroin 
according to figures supplied by the ins the rest of the drugs was 
apprehended mostly by the customs service according to customs 
figures 
the border patrol also stopped some 1 million illegal aliens 
down from the 1985 high of 18 million 
but brien pointed out that only about 7000 of those intercepted 
along the border were caught with drugs and some were american 
smugglers most of these aliens are decent people trying to 
better themselves brien said 
ironically the patrol is the only government unit taking part 
in an interagency antidrug effort without earmarked funding the 
ins is working to change that and hopes to get some 60 million if 
congress passes a drug enforcement bill later this year 
counting on those funds to augment its 210 million budget the 
border patrol has begun a drive to recruit 1000 additional agents 
to patrol the 2000mile usmexico border against aliens and 
drugs 
of the agencys 3600 agents 2900 are on that border and the 
rest on the canadian front 
were ideal for this job were on the border we know the 
terrain our agents are the best trackers around and they all speak 
spanish said brien a naturalized american of irish origin 
since 1986 when the patrol was included in an interagency 
campaign to interdict drugs the number of its narcotics seizures 
has more than doubled to 2751 in 1987 from last october through 
april the patrol intercepted 2236 drug shipments from mexico 
brien as well as officials from other drug agencies believes 
the increased seizures are due partly to increased trafficking by 
smugglers pushed inland by the air and naval cordon that the coast 
guard has imposed along the gulf of mexico 
the usmexico border still accounts for about onethird of the 
cocaine entering the united states and 40 percent of the marijuana 
according to the drug enforcement agency 
much of the cocaine is flown from colombia to mexico where it 
is hidden in safehouses along the border until smugglers pick it 
up said gunnoe the traffickers often use illegal aliens as 
couriers in return for getting them across the border he added 
one of the methods used by the smugglers especially in the 
arizona area is mule trains typically brien said a train will 
consist of nine or 10 mules each carrying 200300 pounds of drugs 
accompanied by four to six outriders armed with sovietmade aka47 
automatic rifles 
as a result the border patrol has issued its agents m16 rifles 
the agents patrol on foot horseback light aircraft and 
allterrain vehicles they also use sensors and lowlight 
television cameras to monitor the border brien said 
we dont have star wars technology like the coast guards 
balloonmounted radars brien said but the border patrol has 25 
assets the other agencies dont belgian malinois dogs especially 
trained to sniff out drugs and people 
the malinois a docile version of the german shepherd have been 
sitting down on the job since april 1987 which is what theyre 
supposed to do when they detect drugs or aliens hidden in trucks 
and trains 
the dogs have detected 244 drug shipments some of them buried 
under loads of onions or rocks brien said 
he said one informant told the border patrol that a colombian 
drug cartel had put out a 30000 contract on rocky the 
threeyearold canine with the biggest number of drug seizures 
under his collar

activist students emboldened by massive 
studentled demonstrations that toppled a president moved sunday 
toward a more public stance by forming a union in defiance of the 
law 
authorities released 4806 prisoners from the insein jail north 
of the capital two days after a riot and mass escape left at least 
57 people dead and 106 injured staterun rangoon radio said 
large breakouts were reported last week at three other prisons 
in burma 
the radio said those released sunday from insein which holds 
about 10000 prisoners included people whose trials were 
continuing or who had less than a years time to serve 
local residents gave some of the freed prisoners clothes small 
packets of rice and bus fare home the radio said other prisoners 
walked into rangoon and asked people on the street for money to 
return home 
on saturday authorities freed 655 prisoners from insein for 
good conduct or because they were nearing the end of their 
sentences 
about 50000 students gathered at rangoon university and learned 
of the formation of the allburma students union and a temporary 
14member executive committee chaired by student leader min ko 
naing 
our fight for democracy is not yet over we want 
democracy right of association and we will continue to resist any 
government that will deprive us of these rights min ko naing 
told the crowd 
burmas students entered national politics in the early 1920s 
and were active against british colonial rule 
shortly after former leader ne win seized power in 1962 he 
crushed a student rebellion at rangoon university ordered the 
student union building destroyed and banned student unions 
underground student unions began to operate about three years 
ago and masked students were in the vanguard of antigovernment 
demonstrations in march june and july 
sundays events appeared to indicate the students were moving 
more into the open but the identities of the executive committee 
members were not revealed and little was known about the union 
leader although his name has been on antigovernment pamphlets in 
recent weeks 
min ko naing told the crowd of students that after democracy was 
won a national student convention would elect a permanent union 
leadership 
governmentrun newspapers began to circulate again sunday 
carrying pictures and stories of antigovernment demonstrations 
employees demanding press freedom had forced all six government 
newspapers four in the burmese language and two in english to 
close for three days 
we agreed to return to work on promises by the authorities 
that we can now write freely said an editorial assistant of one 
newspapers 
although the newspapers played down reports of antigovernment 
agitation burmese readers noted that such articles and photographs 
could never have appeared in the press in past decades 
a western diplomat in rangoon said that although the capital was 
relatively quiet sunday food stocks were reduced and people had to 
go to more than one market to get enough food 
prodemocracy strikes halted all rail service and reduced bus 
service last week union burma airways which earlier last week 
halted domestic flights suspended international service on friday 
the diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
the strikes also closed oil refineries crippled factories and 
left foreign ships waiting at rangoons river port officials said 
saturday 
the turmoil in burma began july 23 when 77yearold ne win 
resigned and the ruling burma socialist program party chose 
hardliner sein lwin as his replacement 
mass studentled demonstrations followed troops shot unarmed 
protestors but the rallies continued until sein lwin quit and was 
replaced as president aug 19 by civilian lawyer maung maung 
rallies have been peaceful since then 
in dhaka bangladesh thousands of people converged on a 
southern sea resort after hearing ne win was hiding there a 
newspaper said sunday 
the bangladesh observer an independent englishlanguage daily 
reported ne win crossed into bangladesh and was staying at a motel 
in coxs bazar about 185 miles south of dhaka 
it said thousands of people who rushed to the motel hoping to 
catch a glimpse of the former dictator were told by police he was 
not there or anywhere in town 
another bangladesh newspaper the masscirculation ittefaq said 
the former ruler and a 26member entourage had taken shelter at a 
buddhist monastery in eastern bangladesh 
the foreign office in dhaka dismissed both reports as baseless 
rumors

the puyallup indian tribe has voted 
overwhelmingly to end years of negotiations and accept a 162 
million offer in return for giving up claim to onetime reservation 
land that includes parts of tacoma 
the agreement works to everyones benefit gabriel landry of 
the puyallup tribal council said after saturdays 319162 vote 
a legal battle for the disputed land mightve taken 20 or 30 
years and would be expensive landry added he said he also 
believed puyallups wouldve been subjected to an antiindian 
backlash if theyd taken the various government bodies involved to 
court 
at issue is who owns what within the boundaries of the old 
reservation which includes parts of downtown tacoma the citys 
northeast side and the tacoma tideflats now home of the booming 
port of tacoma the nations 16th largest port 
treaties dating from the 1850s gave the puyallups a reservation 
of about 18000 acres over the years holdings dwindled as land 
allotted to individual members was sold in what tribal historians 
say often were shady or fraudulent deals 
two decades ago about all that was left was a 35acre cemetery 
but tribal activists fought the state and local governments over 
treaty rights and land claims and vigorous enrollment efforts 
boosted the tribes membership from a low point of about 400 
today the tribe has about 1500 members 
in 1984 the us supreme court let stand a ruling giving the 
tribe title to 12 acres of former puyallup river bed that opened 
the question of whether the tribe could lay claim to more land 
the settlement is to include about 77 million from the federal 
government 21 million from the state and the balance from the 
city of tacoma the port of tacoma and private property owners 
including union pacific railroad 
the next challenge is to get appropriations from congress and 
from the state legislature to help finance the package said us 
rep norm dicks dwash 
he said he would introduce legislation in the house and sen dan 
inouye dhawaii chairman of the select committee on indians 
would introduce the legislation in the senate 
the proposal may not reach congress until next year dicks added 
the tribe voted 118102 to reject a proposed 140 million 
settlement in february 1986 had the tribe rejected this proposal 
it would have gone to court to claim the land 
years of litigation would have been enormously expensive and 
somebody loses dicks said this way both the community and 
the tribe can win and i think thats better for everyone 
frank wright jr administrative manager for the tribe has said 
he sees the settlement as an opportunity to strengthen the tribe 
economically and provide a better future for its members he was 
ousted as tribal council chairman after the earlier proposal was 
rejected 
lynn anderson port spokeswoman said the decision will give 
private landowners clear title and help confirm exactly who owns 
what and allow work with the tribe on issues of fisheries and 
development 
the complex package promises a number of thing to the tribe 
including 20000 in cash to each adult tribal member a variety of 
economic development programs 900 acres of land job training a 
substanceabuse treatment center fish enhancement programs and a 
22 million permanent tribal trust fund 
some members remained strongly opposed to the deal but landry 
said he thought a combination of the length of time involved in the 
negotiations and the fact that the new proposal was better helped 
persuade members to approve it 
people are tired of hearing it and they really do see the 
advantages he said 
while theres no way we can put a value on the amount of loss 
that weve had this gives us an opportunity to put our tribe on 
the map landry said im looking foward im not looking back 
at the injustices weve suffered

soviet and chinese diplomats sunday began talks 
on ending cambodias civil war and a chinese government newspaper 
said vietnam was trying to maintain control of cambodia after it 
ends its 10year occupation 
the commentary prominently displayed on the frontpage of the 
peoples daily accused vietnam of playing games with 
international attempts to bring peace to cambodia 
the nationally televised evening news said the talks between 
soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev and his chinese 
counterpart opened sunday morning 
it showed footage of the two sides sitting down at a long 
conference table but did not give any details about the meeting 
the talks which are closed to foreign reporters are expected to 
last a week 
rogachev said saturday he thought a breakthrough was at hand 
neither china nor the soviet union are direct participants in 
the cambodian conflict but moscow gives financial support to 
vietnam and china supports the threeparty resistance coalition 
headed by prince norodom sihanouk 
china wants the soviet union to put pressure on vietnam to 
withdraw all its 120000 troops from cambodia at an early date 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said last week 
a settlement on the cambodian question would remove the last 
obstacle to normalized chinesesoviet relations and pave the way 
for a summit meeting between soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 
chinese leader deng xiaoping 
the peoples daily editorial reiterated chinas stand that the 
key to a political settlement of the cambodian question is the 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
hanoi in may agreed to withdraw 50000 troops this year and the 
remainder by 1990 
but the editorial said vietnams socalled troop withdrawl 
by 1990 is but a lie 
it recalled that in the past vietnamese withdrawals amounted to 
nothing more than troop rotations it also said some vietnamese 
soldiers were discharged and told to settle in cambodia to help in 
the vietnamization of the country 
the editorial also accused vietnam of delaying its troop 
withdrawal by using worldwide concern that the khmer rouge which 
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people during its 19751978 
rule might again gain power 
the international community must not only guard against the 
khmer rouge gaining power but even more must firmly oppose the 
faction of hun sen gaining sole power the newspaper warned 
prime minister hun sen leads the vietnameseinstalled government 
in phnom penh 
chinese communist party chief zhao ziyang in a meeting with 
visiting japanese prime minister noboru takeshita on friday issued 
the same warning 
the more immediate danger is that vietnam is trying by every 
possible means to legalize the puppet regime in cambodia he said 
the peoples daily editorial concluded with a call for continued 
international pressure on vietnam to leave cambodia and allow the 
cambodian people to set up their own government 
china supports a fourparty coalition government made up of the 
three resistance factions and hun sens government and headed by 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk

soviet bloc agents may have had 
access to nato defense secrets at a us army base for decades 
before a former us sergeant was charged with spying there a west 
german newspaper said sunday 
west germany last week announced the arrest of former us army 
sgt clyde lee conrad who since the late 1970s allegedly sold 
classified information from the army base in bad kreuznach 
officials said conrad 41 revealed secrets about nuclear 
missile bases pipeline systems and troop strength to hungarian 
agents who passed them on to the kremlin and other soviet bloc 
countries 
but the spy ring may have been receiving nato information long 
before conrad became active according to the welt am sonntag 
newspaper which quoted information from unidentified us 
investigators 
conrad was in charge of safekeeping classified nato documents 
which were held in a safe at the bad kreuznach base the newspaper 
said us security officers believe conrads predecessor at the 
base documentation center also worked for the hungarian secret 
service 
the report said hungary a soviet bloc ally for years 
systematically targeted americans in west germany it said 
conrads predecessor was a us military officer of hungarian 
descent who sold nato information to hungarian agents it did not 
give his name did not specify how long he worked at the base and 
did not say where he is now 
there is the fear that for decades top nato secrets have gone 
to the soviet bloc from americans in west germany the newspaper 
said 
norm medland the duty officer at the public information office 
of the us army european headquarters in heidelberg told the 
associated press sunday that an investigation was continuing he 
would not elaborate 
medland also refused comment on the report in the hamburgbased 
welt am sonntag a conservative nationally circulated sunday 
newspaper 
investigators said conrad reported to a hungarian spymaster 
living in vienna and that two hungarianborn swedish brothers 
sandor kercsik 48 and imre kercsik 34 admitted working for the 
hungarian intelligence service prosecutors say the brothers acted 
as couriers in the spy ring allegedly headed by conrad the 
brothers were arraigned last week in sweden 
welt am sonntag said the spymaster has been found but that he is 
safe from prosecution under austrian law it did not elaborate 
the newspaper said investigators believe conrad was paid 11 
million by soviet bloc countries for the information 
the conrad family had so much of everything neighbor 
johanna horst told the unofficial us military newspaper stars and 
stripes mrs horst said conrads wife antje had lots of gold 
jewelry and he just gave her a new car with her initials in gold 
stars and stripes said saturday that conrad who left the army 
in 1985 received a monthly pension of 900 
west german invesigators said they believe conrad kept the money 
in swiss bank accounts according to the cbs television network 
swiss prosecutors friday launched an investigation 
the former sergeant remains in prison and faces espionage 
charges that carry a maximum 10year sentence 
among other charges he allegedly paid another us soldier a 
fivefigure sum for obtaining secret information according to 
chief west german prosecutor kurt rebmann 
no charges have been filed against the soldier who has left the 
army but is still in west germany the die welt newspaper of bonn 
said saturday 
the former soldier apparently provided information leading to 
conrads arrest on tuesday die welt said 
us army officials said conrad of sebring ohio obtained a 
top secret security clearance in 1978 and kept it when he left the 
service

at least one transport plane may have 
been destroyed and some runways damaged when afghan guerrillas 
rocketed kabul airport for more than two hours western diplomats 
said sunday 
the official soviet news agency tass said four people were 
killed and 17 injured during the attack saturday which the 
diplomats said lasted more than two hours 
it was not known if the attack was the same as that reported 
saturday on an unidentified part of kabul in which tass said four 
were killed 
the western diplomats quoting a dispatch from their embassy in 
the afghan capital said more than 20 rockets hit the 
civilianmilitary airport saturday afternoon and early evening 
it said helicopters and jet fighters scrambled but several large 
aircraft remained on the ground 
a western diplomat saw several rockets hit directly in front 
of the old airport control tower about 200 yards to the north and 
then saw three rockets impact directly between the main runways 
apparently damaging at least one of them the dispatch said 
the diplomats spoke to journalists and provided the dispatch on 
condition of anonymity 
the dispatch said damage to aircraft was not confirmed visually 
but the airport remained closed saturday night 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 100000 troops have been helping the marxist government 
fight the moslem rebels 
the guerrillas have stepped up attacks on the capital and 
provincial centers since red army troops began withdrawing from 
afghanistan may 15 under a unbrokered accord 
diplomats said saturdays attack appeared to come from only a 
few miles southeast of the airport it indicated the rebels had 
penetrated the heavy security ringing the city 
reports from the war zones indicate the rebels hold two afghan 
provincial capitals and have besieged at least two more 
afghan leader najib said in a speech to the countrys national 
assembly saturday that his government planned to declare 
coalition or neutral zones on the basis of negotiations with 
armed opposition groups 
the rebels had no immediate reaction guerrilla leaders have 
refused to negotiate with the marxists whom they see as soviet 
puppets 
the sevenparty guerrilla alliance based in peshawar pakistan 
announced plans of its own sunday to hold elections in refugee 
camps and liberated areas inside afghanistan 
winning candidates would form a legislative body under an 
interim cabinet named among guerrilla leaders last june 
rebel spokesman have said their government would set up soon in 
afghanistan but have given no dates they said they hope to hold

a month after the windy city snuffed out smoking 
in public places sending smokers huffing to puff outside or in 
designated areas officials in the nations thirdlargest city say 
the ban is a success 
if complaints are an efficient barometer of whats going on 
then the law is working said patrick lenihan deputy 
commissioner for planning in the department of health we havent 
heard too much about it 
but some restaurant operators say the ordinance which forces 
eateries to guarantee patrons a nonsmoking area has created 
problems 
its costing us money because in order to keep a nonsmoking 
area we have to keep waiters on the job rather than sending them 
home and closing part of the restaurant said peter tung manager 
of trader vics 
were finding that at certain times some of our nonsmoking 
customers have to wait an extra five or 10 minutes said william 
marquardt vice president of the berghoff restaurant when that 
happens theres some grumbling 
the law which bans smoking in restaurants stores businesses 
airports bus terminals subway stations and taxis took effect 
july 25 
but the city council passed the ordinance without setting up a 
mechanism to enforce the law which calls for 25 to 100 fines 
and no one has been cited for violations 
lenihan said the health department and the council are working 
to set up regulations for enforcing the ordinance rules should be 
on the books in about a month 
similar laws have been passed in new york los angeles and other 
cities around the country 
were finding that businesses stores and restaurants are 
trying to come into compliance with the law voluntarilly lenihan 
said in 90 percent of the cases the honor system is working 
almost 75 percent of our customers are nonsmokers so for them 
the law is a plus said michael cameron general manager of 
michael stuarts restaurant at least half the restaurant is 
nonsmoking and were going to expand it 
lenihan said the few complaints received by the health 
department have been about small restaurants that have not stopped 
their patrons from lighting up 
other complaints have come from passengers reporting taxi 
drivers lighting up in their cabs 
weve gotten a few of those but not too many said patricia 
masters of the mayors office of inquiry and information its 
been fairly quiet 
some cabbies said they would keep on puffing despite the ban 
some laws i obey and some i dont said watson rembert i 
still smoke but i just dont do it in front of the police if i 
want to smoke ill light up because im a smoker 
on the corporate front mary jean houde a spokeswoman for sears 
roebuck and co said there had been no complaints in the companys 
8000worker headquarters since the ban took effect 
sears placed no smoking signs in the lobby of the sears 
tower and also put them in bathrooms and conference rooms she said 
ms houde declined to say how much sears spent to comply with 
the new law 
prior to the law taking effect we had designated employee 
lounges as either smoking or nonsmoking ms houde said were 
complying and nobody seems to be upset about it

lisbons biggest fire in two centuries 
destroyed much of the old moorish quarter in the heart of the city 
and fueled fears that other such disasters may follow 
thursdays blaze reduced the historic 10block chiado shopping 
district to smoldering ruins critics blamed the citys antiquated 
firefighting equipment and lax safety rules 
what else will be burned asked the newsmagazine sabado 
architect tomas taveira who watched the handpainted tile 
facades go up in flames said he saw ancient fire trucks crawling 
towards the blaze an hour after it was reported at 3 am 
portugal has to look toward progress in a different way 
taveira said 
jose ferreira de matos president of the lisbon shopowners 
association called the outdated equipment shameful 
some of the fire trucks which are at least 30 years old were 
used in the portuguese colonial wars in africa in the 1960s and 
early 1970s about half of the 800 or so firefighters who battled 
the blaze were volunteers from fire stations near lisbon who came 
with equipment that was even older than the citys 
sabado wrote that the citizens of lisbon long have sensed how 
little is being done to avoid such disasters 
reports said none of the old wood frame buildings in the area 
had sprinkler systems including the 19th century armazens do 
grandela department store where the blaze started no one could 
remember when fire officials last inspected the buildings 
the citys media agreed it was a miracle only one man died 
and 43 people were injured in the fire which started before crowds 
filled the popular area 
the flames swept through the narrow streets with their specialty 
shops and cafes where artists writers and musicians gathered 
lawyers whose offices were on fire scurried down the slippery 
streets carrying documents and were joined by fleeing residents 
carrying cats dogs and caged parakeets 
the fire left 40 stores gutted about 2000 people jobless and 
damages ferreira de matos estimated at 600 million 
fire officials say they dont know what caused the blaze the 
worst in the capital in 200 years but news reports raised the 
possibility of arson ferreira de matos said firefighters were 
victims of a bureaucracy that shows no concern for the welfare of 
this city of 900000 
jose manuel fernandes writing in the weekly expresso in 
december said lisbon has been without direction or a coherent 
urban plan since the death of mayor duarte pacheco in 1948 
mayor nuno kruz abecasis has presided over the city council for 
10 of the 14 years since a 1974 leftist coup ended nearly half a 
century of dictatorship in portugal 
as the country floundered after the revolution the mayor came 
under increasing criticism for leaving lisbon prey to real estate 
speculators who ignored safety or architectural integrity 
the chiado neighborhood which was completed in 1840 was a 
symbol of lisbons literary and artistic past as well as haven for 
its new artists and designers 
construction of the old quarter whose style was considered 
revolutionary for its time was begun after a 1755 earthquake and 
subsequent fire and tidal wave destroyed much of medieval lisbon 
its a terrible shame that the fire had to strike the chiado 
where young portuguese were learning to take pride in the citys 
heritage said longtime resident carole gorton authorities said 
it will be a year before reconstruction begins 
french president francois mitterrand offered his countrys aid 
to repair the damage caused by the catastrophe that touched the 
heart of lisbon 
but critics have little confidence that officials will put such 
aid to proper use they say the money is likely to be frittered 
away on projects that help only those who propose them 
the stateowned diaro de noticias said in an editorial that the 
chiado fire must teach the people of lisbon that they can no longer 
indulge in their favorite pastime of deixar andar letting 
things pass

smokefilled air and 
reduced access to parts of yellowstone national park because of 
forest fires have reduced the numbers of tourists and prompted the 
early closure of some of park lodgings 
the 296room lake hotel on the north shore of yellowstone lake 
usually stays open through late september 
but just 76 of the recently renovated hotels rooms were filled 
saturday night and on sunday visitors were told the hotel was 
closing as of 11 am 
nearby lake lodge with 180 rooms will remain open for the time 
being 
with access to the lake area restricted to only the east 
entrance of the park and the famous old faithful geyser 
inaccessible except from the north and west entrances it wasnt 
profitable to keep the majestic victorian hotel open said steve 
tedder vice president and general manager of tw recreational 
services inc yellowstones concessionaire 
basically the overall situation is with the current fire 
condition unpredictable road conditions the smoke conditions 
business has declined significantly over the past week he said 
at nearby fishing bridge just 16 of the 320 recreational 
vehicle sites were filled he said 
lake hotel is the latest yellowstone lodging facility closed in 
recent weeks by forest fires that have charred roughly 400000 
acres of the countrys first national park 
earlier this month the grant village complex which contains a 
hotel a campground and employee dormitories was closed when the 
red and shoshone fires approached from the west 
last week the canyon area was evacuated when flames from the 
33265acre wolf lake fire burned to within onehalf mile of the 
complex which now houses a firefighters camp 
while the flames have stayed away from the lake area the smoke 
has not guests go to sleep at night smelling smoke and wake up in 
the morning to the acrid stench 
flames can be seen from canyon and the road from canyon to 
norris and south to madison junction is lined by acre after acre of 
charred smouldering trees in some areas burning trees can be 
seen from the roads and snags burnedout trees that have toppled 
occasionally line road shoulders 
tourists determined to see yellowstone despite the fires can 
stop along the few roads that are open to watch herds of elk and 
bison grazing in unburned meadows or to see columns of smoke rising 
thousands of feet into the sky 
the tourist drought has not yet seriously affected the old 
faithful area which tedder called one of the least smoky areas 
of the park 
on friday night 296 of the 320 rooms in the old faithful inn 
were filled while saturday night 192 of the rooms were taken he 
said 
however getting from one side of the park to the other is 
impossible at times tedder said 
at this point there is no access to the interior of the 
park he said 
the drop in business has cost tw services more than 1 million 
in sales although tedder didnt have an estimate of the overall 
drop including the reduction in lodging reservations 
the company is negotiating with its insurance companies to see 
if some of the losses can be recouped he said and talks also will 
be held with the national park service to see if the 
concessionaires contract can be altered 
under that contract tw services is required to pump 22 percent 
of its gross sales back into yellowstone in maintenance and 
improvements 
the company also has a 5 percent profit cap in its contract 
whereby any profits above 5 percent must be funneled back into the 
facilities said tedder

police shut down a federation of 108 
palestinian charities sunday and accused it of being a plo front 
in the west bank the body of an alleged arab collaborator with 
israel was found burned and tied to an electric pole 
a jewish settler opened fire on stonethrowing palestinians who 
smashed the windshield of his car in the west bank town of 
qalqiliya wounding two of the attackers military officials said 
arab reports denied the settler was provoked 
the raid on the charity association followed the closing last 
week of seven arab professional associations and the nablus offices 
of a federation of 45 trade unions aligned with plo chairman yasser 
arafats fatah faction 
the crackdown was designed to keep the palestine liberation 
organization from taking over organizations that were controlled by 
jordans king hussein before he severed ties with the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip last month 
the israeli moves were part of a larger effort to disrupt the 
grassroots organization of the 8monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the territories israel seized in the 1967 
middle east war 
the burned and bloodstained body of samih youssef dababsi was 
found tied to an electric pole in the harti sheikh neighborhood of 
hebron arab reports and an israeli photographer said 
the victim was beaten on the head and his hands were tied to his 
side the reports said palestinian sources described the victim as 
a collaborator with israeli authorities police said he was a thief 
an army official speaking on the basis of anonymity confirmed 
the killing 
the underground leadership of the uprising has demanded that 
palestinians working for israel resign in the past week 
palestinians and alleged collaborabors with israeli authorities 
have clashed at least seven times 
since the uprising began dec 8 255 palestinians have been 
killed most by israeli gunfire four israelis also have died 
in jerusalem police raided the federation of charitable 
societies after west bank military commander maj gen amram 
mitzneh ordered it closed for one year 
the charity office distributed plo finances under cover of 
financial aid and charity a government statement said 
police also closed the maktabat el haya news agency for a year 
the statement said the agency was used to advance the goals of the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine a damascusbased plo 
faction headed by george habash 
ellen el araj deputy head of the charity group denied the 
organization had political goals and said many of the groups 
projects would be hurt by the closing 
she said its activities include helping the poor and handicapped 
and providing funds for youngsters to attend preschools 
i dont know why the israelis are carrying out this campaign 
and i denounce it said mrs el araj 68 
she said the federation includes 108 charities in jerusalem that 
are funded by arab charitable organizations in jordan and by 
aramco the saudi arabian oil company 
col ranaan gissin deputy army spokesman said the charitable 
groups acted as a conduit for plo funds and that the trade unions 
tried to recruit and organize for fatah 
he said such organizations long had been affiliated with plo 
factions but had been dormant in the past 
gissin said plo activity increased after jordan broke ties with 
the occupied lands and israel arrested more than 300 community 
leaders 
most were members of the recently outlawed popular communities 
and strike forces that organized antiisraeli boycotts strikes and 
demonstrations as part of the uprising 
the crackdown created a public relations problem for israeli 
authorities because the groups were also doing work that helped the 
palestinian community 
we have to think twice because they serve other functions such 
as improving working conditions and social welfare we dont want 
to stop these activities but when it involves the plo we have no 
choice gissin said 
meanwhile police were searching for the killer of of an 
8yearold israeli boy hanan zagor whose body was found saturday 
in a dry riverbed in his home village of qiryat tivon about 10 
miles south of haifa 
nearby police found a large rock believed to be the murder 
weapon and the youths skullcap a sign that he was a religiously 
observant jew 
israel radio quoted police officials as saying the investigation 
was centering on possible arab suspects but they had not 
determined if the motive was terrorist or criminal 
in another development officials of the countrys egged bus 
cooperative said buses that travel in the west bank are being 
equipped with shatterproof windows they said nearly 1700 buses 
have been damaged by stones and firebombs during the palestinian 
uprising

ended for the day 
perez de cuellar told reporters he was trying to build 
bridges and avert a breakdown 
we cannot say now that we have reached a deadlock he said 
in response to questions he said difficulties had arisen over 
troop withdrawals and the possibility of deadlock always exists 
i hope we will move back to the ministerial level as soon as 
the disagreement is settled he added 
iran will face from our side full preparedness to confront any 
behavior of aggressive aspect said a statement by iraqs deputy 
foreign minister sadoun hamadi the statement was released in 
baghdad and distributed here 
aziz left the un offices after three hours of consultations 
sunday velayati departed an hour later 
un spokesman francois giuliani said the negotiations were 
expected to continue monday at a lower technical level the 
secretarygeneral thinks we are likely to be here for a long 
time he said 
aziz departed shortly after the hardline statement by hamadi was 
received from baghdad it declared iraqi sovereignty over the 
disputed shatt alarab waterway and blamed iran for continued 
tension in the region 
the peace talks which began thursday resumed sunday after a 
day of reflection as iran accused iraq of stalling and said the 
negotiations could drag on for years 
the statement quoting hamadi said iran is placing obstacles 
and pretexts in maneuvering misguiding and gaining time which 
give new evidence of its unseriousness and increase our 
suspicions of the nature of its intentions in peace 
he reaffirmed iraqs claim over the shatt alarab a major issue 
in the talks in 1980 iraqi president saddam hussein tore up the 
1975 treaty that had divided the waterway down the median line 
any attempt to minimize the full sovereignty of iraq on this 
vital lane would be faced with categorical rejection from our 
side hamadi said 
the dispute over the waterway is one of the factors that began 
the 8yearold persian gulf war 
iran says the 1975 treaty still is valid and rejects iraqs 
claim to complete sovereignty 
hamadi said any procrastination exercised by the iranian side 
in this respect would harm the issue of peace 
he concluded by saying that any iranian allegations and 
aggression would face from our side rejection and full 
preparedness to confront any behavior of aggressive aspect 
the iraqi statement was delivered after the return of iraqi 
officials who had flown to baghdad on saturday for consultations 
with their government about the troubled talks 
the negotiations are aimed at consolidating a unsupervised 
ceasefire and working on a comprehensive peace 
irans official islamic republic news agency said perez de 
cuellar suggested setting up an impartial committee to identify the 
aggressor in the iraniraq war and to release its findings by the 
end of november 
the report monitored in nicosia was confirmed by western 
diplomats iran has insisted that iraq be branded the aggressor 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
irna said the threeman committee would be headed by a member of 
the international court of justice in the hague the netherlands 
iran and iraq each would send a liaison officer it said 
the talks between velayati and aziz are the first official 
contact between the two sides since war broke out in september 1980 
in tehran sunday irans deputy foreign minister javad 
mansouri accused iraq of undermining negotiations by claiming 
sovereignty over the disputed shatt alarab waterway 
he also repeated irans demand for formation of an impartial 
panel to determine which side started the war iran says iraq must 
be branded the aggressor before there can be lasting peace 
iraq continues to have designs on irans territorial 
integrity mansouri was quoted as saying by irna 
the united nations approved a resolution calling for the end of 
the persian gulf war in july 1987 iraq endorsed the resolution 
shortly after it was passed but iran refused to accept it until 
july 18 after a series of battlefield setbacks 
perez de cuellar has said he hopes to announce a timetable for 
the withdrawal of troops prisoner exchange and other elements of 
the peace plan before thursday when he travels to lisbon

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski on 
sunday called for national reconciliation and said top government 
officials may be fired for failing to deal with the strongest wave 
of strikes since 1981 
but the twoday meeting of the communist partys central 
committee ended without any immediate recommendations for changes 
in prime minister zbigniew messners government 
solidarity leader lech walesa was slightly injured in a scuffle 
with police troops blocked about 400 protesters trying to march on 
the strikebound lenin shipyard in gdansk where walesa founded the 
independent union federation in 1980 
talks ended a stubborn mine strike in the south but 10 strikes 
continued at ports shipyards factories and one mine there were 
no reports of police attempts to dislodge workers in occupation 
strikes 
solidarity estimated about 8500 people still were occupying 
workplaces striking for higher pay and legalization of solidarity 
which was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981 and 
outlawed in 1982 
jaruzelski the communist party leader severely criticized the 
partys handpicked government for failing to deal with building 
economic and political tensions before they got out of control in 
the strikes which began aug16 
he said the central committee would decide the fate of messners 
government before parliament meets in september he also called for 
for changes in the party leadership 
jaruzelski whose closing speech was broadcast on television 
endorsed the idea of a discussion with representatives of striking 
workers 
we are invariably in favor of settling even the most difficult 
questions by patience and dialogue the hand remains 
outstretched he said but there is no chance for an everything 
or nothing attitude 
the government has not ruled out that such a forum might include 
walesa who last held a highlevel meeting with authorities in 1982 
while interned after the imposition of martial law 
at a news conference after the meeting party spokesman jerzy 
majka said walesa was a possible candidate for such talks 
the 230member central committee endorsed continuing economic 
and political reform with no halfway measures but it condemned 
lawbreaking and destruction a reference to illegal strikes 
jaruzelski said the the government has a constant duty to keep 
in touch with the populations feelings and he criticized 
officials for fanning out across the nation only after the fire 
has started 
we are not used in the party to criticizing the government 
from the rostrum of the central committee that we have always done 
in the family silently he said now we are finishing with 
that practice 
but jaruzelskis references to the opposition were milder 
our problems cannot be solved either by the weapon of strikes 
or the means of coercion he said more than once in polish 
history brother was pitted against brother time passed and then 
they were standing side by side its about time that this road 
prevails 
there is no freedom without a sense of responsibility he 
said echoing a favorite slogan of solidarity there is no 
freedom without solidarity 
jaruzelski proposed transforming his consultative council 
into a council for national accord that presumably would seek 
to forge areas of agreement between the government and opponents 
walesa left the lenin shipyard saturday to confer with advisers 
about the possibility of talks with the government 
when he tried to enter the cordonedoff shipyard sunday morning 
a police officer tried to stop him said a walesa aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity walesa pulled away but lost a shoe and 
scratched his hand when he climbed over the 7foot fence into the 
yard the aide said 
a mass at the nearby st brygidas church drew about 10000 
worshipers who spilled into the square in front of the packed 
church 
from this place we have the right as free poles to call for 
freedom and the arrival of government authorities for roundtable 
talks in the shipyard the rev henryk jankowski a walesa 
adviser told worshipers 
let anyone who has a package of solutions for the current 
situation sit at this table 
after the service about 400 people tried to walk the five 
blocks from the church to the shipyard entrance but they were 
blocked by massive lines of police in riot gear the crowd 
dispersed peacefully 
the staterun pap news agency said strikers decided to end the 
10dayold strike at the jastrzebie mine in the southern town of 
jastrzebie at 6 pm 
the government and strikers earlier said talks were under way at 
the mine which was one of only two mines still on strike 
nationwide compared to 12 last week 
miners agreed to talk with management on local pay issues after 
hearing rumors that walesa would be speaking directly with the 
government about legalizing solidarity said a strike spokeswoman 
in jastrzebie details on the tentative settlement were not 
immediately available

members of the latvian community are coming 
to the defense of a man who government officials allege was a 
member of a pronazi police unit during world war ii 
federal prosecutors initiated deportation proceedings last 
monday against edgars inde 79 a retired factory worker who lives 
in minneapolis 
in the civil lawsuit filed in us district court authorities 
allege that inde belonged to the latvian auxiliary police and 
participated in killing unarmed jews and other civilians during the 
nazi occupation of latvia in 1941 and 1942 latvia is now part of 
the soviet union 
he denies this definitely said the rev modrus gulbis of 
christ latvian evangelical lutheran church in minneapolis who has 
spoken with inde as of this moment i am quite convinced he is 
innocent although i would definitely want to hear the other side 
of the story 
the suit alleges that inde hid his participation in war crimes 
when he came to the united states in 1949 and applied for 
naturalization he became a us citizen in 1955 
when contacted monday inde denied he killed jews no no no 
no no no he said 
his lawyer ivars berzins of new york city has refused comment 
inde is a wellliked member of the 2000member latvian 
community and is active in theater 
i can tell you with all my heart this is hard to take that 
people might think all latvians are pronazis said the rev 
janis rozentals a retired theologian from lutheran northwestern 
seminary 
many latvianamericans believe the justice departments office 
of special investigations which investigates nazi war criminals 
living in the united states has been overzealous in its 
investigations of latvians and other baltic peoples 
it seems like in the last five years thats been the case 
said ojars kalnins spokesman for the american latvian association 
in rockville md it seems like the balts are being singled out 
because thats the kind of evidence that osi is getting from the 
soviets 
osi director neal sher said although a number of current 
investigations involve americans of baltic origin he didnt know 
what percentage they constitute of the 600 cases under 
investigation

hooded ku klux klansmen preaching white supremacy 
staged a rally sunday near a multiracial gathering commemorating 
martin luther king jr as hundreds of clubcarrying police tried 
to keep the crowds under control 
fourteen people were arrested most for disorderly conduct in a 
tense afternoon at marquette park where similar rallies sparked 
violence and resulted in 17 arrests two years ago 
we had no idea that wed both be here on the same day but we 
are damn proud to be here for the white race an unidentified 
klansman wearing a white hood told an allwhite crowd of about 500 
some members of the crowd held nazi flags and wore white power 
tshirts 
a line of uniformed policemen and wooden barriers kept the crowd 
about 40 feet from the stage 
about 900 police officers some on horses and other carrying 
clubs filled the park and separated the kkk rally from the 
multiracial group that gathered about a halfmile away for a later 
rally 
it might be legal to give the kkk a permit to spread hatred 
and violence but its immoral said dee d smith simmons an 
organizer of the dream day quest commemorating the 25th 
anniversary of kings famous i have a dream speech 
mounted police blocked a crowd of several hundred klan 
sympathizers some shouting white power who tried to break 
away from the rally and march to the gathering of about 200 blacks 
whites and hispanics 
three whites including a woman wearing a tshirt with the 
white power slogan were taken away in police wagons but 
officers refused to say why 
about 150 police officers surrounded a separate multiracial 
crowd of about 300 who marched from a nearby church to attend the 
king rally which continued after the klansmen began dispersing 
officers fended off several hundred klan sympathizers who tried to 
taunt the marchers 
im thankful that the police are here but the klan members 
are the ones who are frightened i feel some pity and a lot of 
irritation said rosetta martin a white woman from suburban 
hazel crest 
we organized this to demonstrate to all of chicago that the 
days of racial division are over the rev b herbert martin the 
citys commissioner of human relations said at the king rally 
in 1966 king led a protest march into marquette park where he 
was greeted by a crowd of whites throwing stones 
ten years ago a neonazi group threatened to march through 
suburban skokie whose 69000 residents include 23000 jews that 
march was called off after lawsuits and community pressure

gangs of youths threw bombs and 
hijacked trucks in west belfast for a second night sunday after a 
convicted ira guerrilla was extradited from the irish republic 
at least 16 people were wounded in the rash of shootings 
bombings and other attacks that police blamed on the irish 
republican army police said there were no serious injuries 
violence was reported throughout northern ireland after robert 
russell a convicted ira guerrilla was extradited to northern 
ireland to complete a prison term for attempted murder and to face 
new charges of prison escape 
in the neighboring irish republic three police officers were 
hurt saturday during a clash as a convoy crossed into northern 
ireland 
since saturday there were 193 attacks on police units 23 
shooting incidents 17 bombings and 56 hijackings of cars vans and 
buses police said some vehicles were set afire blown up or left 
with bombs that were defused by security forces 
they said 11 police officers one soldier and four civilians 
were wounded in the two days of violence bombings were reported in 
belfast newry and londonderry 
on sunday a bomb was thrown at a police station in mainly 
catholic west belfast several vehicles were hijacked and many 
gasoline bombs were thrown at police said a spokesman for the 
royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force however he 
said no injuries were reported in those incidents 
earlier sunday a calf grazing on a military shooting range was 
killed when it set off a bomb apparently meant for locally 
recruited soldiers who train there 
police said the calf probably triggered the bomb by stepping on 
a pressure plate or tripwire on a footpath used by soldiers at the 
range at portballintrae in county antrim on northern irelands 
north coast 
chief inspector ian williamson responsible for policing the 
falls road area of west belfast told the british broadcasting 
corp that the violence was planned by the ira and its legal 
political wing sinn fein 
they may claim or give the impression that russell was the 
reason but it was just the excuse this day would have come 
regardless of whatever reason they dreamed up for it williamson 
said 
the predominantly roman catholic irish republican army is 
fighting to unite northern ireland with the overwhelmingly catholic 
irish republic 
bombs began exploding hours after russell was extradited to 
northern ireland 
hundreds of ira supporters clashed with police in dublin and the 
border village of carrickarnon early saturday to protest russells 
extradition police and witnesses said 
in dublin about 80 supporters who had staged an allnight vigil 
in front of mountjoy prison attacked police with bottles and tried 
to knock them off motorcycles as they prepared to transport russell 
50 miles to the border 
other demonstrators lay in the road to try to block the convoy 
and more violence flared when police began dragging them away 
russell 30 escaped from northern irelands maze prison in a 
mass breakout by ira inmates in september 1983 he fled to ireland 
and was arrested in dublin in 1984 the last legal bid to stop his 
extradition failed in the high court in dublin on friday 
several hundred demonstrators waited in heavy rain for russells 
convoy at carrickarnon inside the irish republic on the road 
between dublin and belfast irish police said 
before the convoy arrived they attacked police with stones 
bottles and fists chief superintendent john nolan of the garda 
siochana irelands police force said three officers were hurt in 
the fighting 
some protesters sat in the road to form a human barricade 
against the police van carrying russell but the van avoided them 
by veering off the road and speeding across a field 
police said russell was handed over to northern ireland police 
put in a helicopter and flown 30 miles to lisburn near belfast 
after a brief court appearance he was returned to the topsecurity 
maze prison

here are some quotes from political figures 
sunday 
 
dan quayle the republican vice presidential nominee in an 
interview with the associated press i will eventually be an 
asset to the ticket i feel that i have a lot to offer in 
leadership i feel i have a lot to offer in the area of national 
defense i feel that i have worked very hard in the area of arms 
control 
 
lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee on 
quayles qualifications now i wouldnt say that he couldnt 
grow into the job he probably could but if a tragedy befell a 
president youd have to be able to move in immediately and take 
over and do what has to be done in facing whatever issues that 
confront you at that time 
 
george bush the republican presidential nominee on his showing 
in the polls i think its very encouraging movement in the 
polls but these things change so dramatically i cant deny 
its encouraging but theres certainly nothing there that makes me 
relax 
 
jesse jackson on efforts by democrats to recapture those who 
voted for reagan well i would think that the democrats 
strength is not between the 45yard lines it will be the 
unregistered voters who need to be inspired

firefighters torched more 
than 500 acres of timber sunday to make a dramatic goalline stand 
against the leading edge of the largest and perhaps most stubborn 
of the blazes in and around yellowstone national park 
this fire has kicked us for months now were going to kick it 
back forest service fire information office pat kaunert said 
weve got to sacrifice this in order to save the timber base and 
these towns this is where we make a stand 
seven bulldozers cleared a sixmile 70footwide freeway 
through the pines saturday and sunday before the huge backfire 
was set a hot shot crew of 19 used drip torches loaded with 
diesel fuel and gasoline to torch the acreage between the safety 
swath and the 182000acre clover mist blaze which has moved to 
within a few miles of us highway 212 which skirts the 
wyomingmontano border and the communities of crandall wyo and 
cooke city mont 
flames rose 100 feet into the air and dense smoke billowed over 
the valley as the new fire burned back toward the most aggressive 
edge of clover mist about 200 firefighters stood guard at the edge 
of the blaze armed with shovels and fire hoses 
the forest service eager for its first victory against the 
fire had to wait until late afternoon for proper conditions 
helicopters and airplanes loaded with water and fire retardant 
stood by in case the wind shifted and blew flames back at the 
firefighters 
this is the moment weve been waiting for kaunert said 
if the fire gets over highway 212 wed be in a very bad 
position to defend the towns 
the backfire was indicative of the progress frustrated 
firefighters have made against blazes in the last two days calm 
favorable winds and cool temperatures at night have slowed the 
ravaging flames 
earlier erratic winds kept forcing firefighters to retreat as 
clover mist moved out of yellowstone and closer to towns along the 
wyomingmontana border and the forecast included more potential 
trouble in the form of a new weather system approaching perhaps as 
early as tuesday that could bring a change in wind direction and 
strong gusts 
clover mist is one of five forest fires burning in yellowstone 
and surrounding forests shonsone national forest borders 
yellowstones eastern edge 
until sunday mountainous terrain had kept forest service crews 
from mounting a massive assault against clover mist 
we had to wait until it got to where we could get at it 
kaunert said 
for more than a week smoke and occasional flames climbing over 
the mountains protecting cooke city had troubled townspeople who 
were told friday to prepare for an evacuation that was never 
necessary three crandallarea ranches were evacuated saturday 
in addition to the towns the fire also threatened some of the 
most productive timber land in the clarks fork ranger district 
its very valuable timber as far as the local economy goes 
said forest service district ranger randy herzberg 
enough timber is harvested annually out of the threatened area 
to build 100 homes herzberg said

sen lloyd bentsen said sunday that sen dan quayle probably 
could grow into the job of being president if it became necessary 
while quayle said hes ready for a debate with bentsen to show 
voters whos qualified 
bentsens remarks were the faintest of praise from a 67yearold 
texas democrat seeking to contrast his experience with that of a 
41yearold indiana republican and to make the difference a major 
issue in their campaign for vice president 
appearing on nbcs meet the press bentsen was asked whether 
quayle was qualified to be president 
frankly he would not have been on my short list as i look 
over my senate colleagues said bentsen he obviously was on 
the short list of the hard right 
now i wouldnt say that he couldnt grow into the job he 
probably could but if a tragedy befell a president youd have to 
be able to move in immediately and take over and do what has to be 
done in facing whatever issues that confront you at that time 
quayle in an inflight interview sunday with the associated 
press said he has no quarrel with his senate colleague bentsen in 
fact quayle focused during his sevenstate campaign swing on 
dukakis saying a victory by the massachusetts governor would be a 
disaster for the country 
ive served with sen bentsen for almost eight years he is 
not the issue quayle said the issue is michael dukakis 
michael dukakis view of america is a much different view than 
george bushs michael dukakis approach to national defense his 
approach to the economy his approach to child care all of those 
approaches are much different than george bushs 
quayle also said he is not disturbed by polls that show a 
majority of the public views bentsen as more qualified for the vice 
presidential spot and to be president if it comes to that 
the american people are just beginning to see dan quayle he 
said im going to continue to talk about the issues when we 
have the debate between lloyd bentsen and dan quayle the american 
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best 
qualified vice presidential candidate 
quayle attended church in sacramento calif and then made the 
crosscountry flight home to washington for a couple of days of 
rest and planning for this weeks swing through louisiana 
arkansas mississippi alabama florida georgia and south carolina 
the contenders for the no 1 chair in the oval office 
republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis were out and 
about but keeping things lowkey 
bush attended services at the episcopal church near the houston 
hotel where he maintains an official address then took in an 
astros baseball game later he attended a memorial service in 
austin for former texas gov price daniel 
during an inflight interview bush commented on his recent 
boost in the polls saying i think its very encouraging 
movement in the polls but these things change so dramatically 
i cant deny its encouraging but theres certainly nothing there 
that makes me relax 
dukakis went to church and then attended a sunday afternoon 
concert he planned to spend the next two days in massachusetts 
attending to gubernatorial duties 
but if bentsen was the only candidate taking a highly visible 
stance sunday he was not the only political figure doing do 
jesse jackson assured another group of television interviewers 
on abcs this week with david brinkley that he was behind the 
dukakisbentsen ticket but left it a little fuzzy to what extent 
to a questioners suggestion that he had not quite made up his 
mind on how hard to play the game jackson said 
well ive made up my mind but of course i need signals of 
sensitivity that reflect the urgency of now we must keep expanding 
beyond the present democratic base with an intense voter 
registration campaign that has not yet been agreed upon and 
planned there must be more inclusion at the senior policy 
positions in order that there might be more sensitivity around 
governor dukakis 
jackson said it was fine for the democratic ticket to reach out 
to middleofthe road democrats who have been voting for ronald 
reagan 
at the same time he said i would think the democrats 
strength is not between the 45yard lines this obsession to 
recall reagan democrats who are with quayle under the bush 
later jackson said my concern is that if were going to win 
it will be by the margin of our enthusiasm of our expanded 
participation therefore my emphasis the way im helping the 
ticket at this point is engaging in massive registration 
bentsens remarks about quayles experience were a continuation 
of the democratic strategy of calling attention to the betterknown 
texas senators 17 years in the senate compared to quayles 
7year tenure 
asked about the flap over quayles membership in the indiana 
national guard during the vietnam war bentsen noted that all 
candidates for national office are subject to intense media 
scrutiny 
i think that has now been done insofar as senator quayle and 
his decision to go into the guard and what motivated him and how he 
was able to enter that guard he said and now i think we 
should move on to other issues 
bentsen acknowledged that he has differences with dukakis on a 
variety of issues but insisted that was a plus for the democratic 
ticket 
i think what youre seeing is a situation where michael 
dukakis was not looking for a clone of himself he said he was 
reaching out to the center it shows something of the integrity of 
this man that he is not afraid to listen to a different 
viewpoint

no one won floridas 32 million lotto 
jackpot pushing the grand prize in the weekly numbers game to at 
least 50 million only 14 million short of the nations record 
lottery prize 
lottery officials estimate each weeks jackpot based on 
projected sales 
but lottery secretary rebecca paul said sunday she didnt know 
if ticket sales would surpass expectations this week and push the 
jackpot past the national record we dont know whats going to 
happen she said 
the size of the prize should give floridas lottery national 
exposure that will help attract tourists to the monthsold game 
mrs paul said 
that is really really good for the state of florida she 
said 
the national record for a lottery prize was set in june when 
california gave away 514 million to two winners 
in the florida lotto game players try to match six numbers from 
one through 49 tickets are 1 
no one matched the six winning numbers drawn saturday 20 42 
6 29 45 and 26 
the prizes are rolled over into the next weeks purse fueling 
sales as they get bigger the florida jackpot increases quickly 
compared with other states partly because the state set up its 
lottery with some of the toughest odds of any lottery in the nation 
nearly 14 million to 1 against winning 
florida joined 27 states and the district of columbia that have 
legalized lotteries when the lotto game started in april

japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga says a free 
trade agreement between his country and the united states is being 
considered more seriously because recent successes in resolving 
trade disputes have improved relations between the two nations 
it is time to build our partnership on the basis of our 
interlocking strengths instead of constantly warring over our 
separate weaknesses matsunaga told the washington council on 
international trade last week 
the ambassador said that the muchdiscussed us trade deficit 
and the corresponding japanese trade surplus simply do not 
comprehend the scope and complexity of the economic and political 
relationships between the two countries 
it is quite understandable therefore that thoughtful people 
on both sides of the pacific are now considering the possible 
benefits of some form of free trade arrangement between the united 
states and japan the two largest and most dynamic economies in the 
world whose twoway trade is exceeded in value only by americas 
trade with canada matsunaga said in his thursday address 
a usjapan free trade agreement which essentially would 
remove trade barriers between the two nations was proposed first 
in 1981 by mike mansfield us ambassador to japan the initial 
reaction was widespread skepticism that two countries with such 
different cultures and legal systems could fashion a workable 
agreement 
but earlier this year senate majority leader robert byrd raised 
the issue with japanese prime minister noboru takeshita and sen 
lloyd bentsen chairman of the foreign relations committee and now 
democratic vice presidential nominee asked the us international 
trade commission to prepare a report listing the pros and cons of 
such an agreement 
the interest is driven not only by the increasingly complex 
trade relationship between the two countries but by concerns by 
both about their trade relations with other nations 
japan has concerns about how the uscanada free trade 
agreement may affect its own trade with the united states and 
canada 
and both countries are concerned that the lowering of trade 
barriers among european community nations scheduled for 1992 
could lead to increased difficulty in gaining access to that market 
david rohr a member of the federal international trade 
commission who recently visited japan to gather opinions for the 
study requested by bentsen said the japanese are really scared 
of the sweeping us trade bill signed into law last week and 
criticized by matsunaga as disproportionately protectionist 
because of its sanctions for unfair trade practices

converse inc has james dean 
fireengine red and greenwich village to thank for reviving sales 
of canvas sneakers at the company whose reputation was built on an 
indiana basketball player named chuck taylor 
long considered a traditionalist in an industry where fashion 
and high technology move like a fast break 80yearold converse is 
trying to shed its image of what one industry observer called a 
jock company 
but in doing that converse has relied on its old canvas 
standards the chuck taylor allstar for basketball and the jack 
purcell for tennis with nostalgia trendy converse sales climbed 
to a record 318 million last year 
were still perceived to be a male basketball shoe company 
said converse president gib ford who wore chuck taylors when 
playing on the 1956 us olympic basketball team weve had a 
very difficult time trying to break the image 
founded by marquis m converse near this town about 25 miles 
north of boston the converse rubber shoe company in 1917 
introduced the first sneaker designed for basketball a hightop 
brown canvas shoe with black rubber sole that became the chuck 
taylor and has remained unchanged since 1936 
but the development of leather basketball sneakers and athletic 
footwear for everything from aerobics to racquetball to walking 
forced converse to retrench 
in an attempt to stay competitive with industry leaders reebok 
and nike converse in the last three years has doubled research to 
about 3 million hired a team of industrial designers and doubled 
advertising to around 20 million 
and while they dont always seem happy about it converse 
executives acknowledge that fashion is a part of todays footwear 
industry the chuck taylor which became funky in manhattan in 
late1986 now comes in 56 colors and motifs including robinegg 
blue dayglo orange and graffiti splash 
the company sold a record 135 million pair of allstars in 
1987 but sales are expected to drop to around 10 million this 
year sales of the simplistic oxfordwhite jack purcell named for 
a canadian badminton star are projected to grow almost six times 
to about 300000 
converses reliance on the fad appeal of its canvas classics is 
viewed in the industry as risky and the company says it is pushing 
its womens childrens and hightech energyreturn athletic 
shoes 
they hit with the chucks and the colors because it became a 
fashion item when that slows down they go back to being an 
athletic company said matt zale owner of us athletics a 
15store retail chain in manhattan and long island 
the jack purcell made of no 10 duck canvas with a thin blue 
band semicircling the toe and a flat bottom was developed by the 
bf goodrich co in 1932 converse bought the shoe in 1972 along 
with goodrichs footwear division 
sales reached 750000 pair annually in the mid70s but quickly 
declined as leather tennis sneakers hit the market by the end of 
the decade converse was selling just 50000 jack purcells a year 
and doing no promotion for the shoe 
then the companys tennis marketing manager walking in harvard 
square two years ago spotted a 1955 poster of james dean looking 
vaguely beat generation as he lounged on a movie set in chinos and 
tshirt 
lo and behold he had on a pair of jack purcells said lou 
nagy converses marketing communications director 
the company this year shaped a 500000 advertising campaign 
around the poster promoting the jack purcell in magazines such as 
esquire gq and the new yorker 
purcell 84 said in an interview from his toronto home that the 
sturdy sneaker was revolutionary at a time when blisters and sore 
heels and turned ankles were the order of the day 
its almost identical to what it was back in the 30s said 
purcell a semiretired stockbroker who first won the world 
badminton championship in 1932 basically it was a soundly 
engineered product right from the start 
its still a very comfortable item he added im wearing 
a pair right now 
the current nostalgia binge isnt the first for converse in the 
1960s lowtop black canvas sneakers were popularized by california 
beach boys and became standard high school and college dress 
nationwide 
the surge in sales of chuck taylors was based on looks on the 
street not durability on the court converts to jack purcells 
mostly are after the sneakers retro1950s look 
the industry is attributing the success of converse to a 
kind of return to classics plus the value you get from a canvas 
shoe said one athletic footwear industry analyst who asked not 
to be named 
chuck taylors and jack purcells retail for under 30 leather 
basketball sneakers today including converse models can cost from 
60 to 100 
converse changed hands three times in its first 64 years before 
it was sold to eltra corp an industrial manufacturer in 1972 
sales plummeted to a low of 119 million in 1979 when converse was 
bought by allied corp 
two years later allied put the shoemaker on the block but a 
group of executives engineered a leveraged buyout to forestall 
another sale the company went public in 1982 but four years later 
was acquired by interco inc a consumer goods manufacturer and 
retailer that is currently the target of an unfriendly takeover 
attempt 
after the 1979 low converse sales gradually grew to 266 
million in 1984 dropped to 220 million and then soared as chuck 
taylors became fashionable 
taylor who played for teams in buffalo and new york worked for 
converse from 1921 until his death in 1969 
his model shoe was the dominant sneaker among pros and on city 
playgrounds through the 1960s when it was worn by more than 90 
percent of pro and college players more teenage girls than 
basketball players wear the sneaker now 
nobody ever thought theyd see the colors ford said im 
sure if chuck knew hed roll over in his grave

long after explorers charted their course by 
stars or compass a computer software pioneer has literally mapped 
out a product and a business strategy that is guiding his company 
to success 
the 3yearold company is mapinfo corp which sells a software 
package that allows the personal computer user to merge databases 
and digital maps of areas within the united states 
with a couple of keystrokes the user can place the cursor at a 
point on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access to 
volumes of information about that point 
mapinfo can search a database for points within a boundary 
determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address 
users can focus in on a 52foot span of a city block or zoom out to 
a 5000mile range 
that may not sound like anything new says mapinfo president 
sean osullivan with a smile but his young company claims to be 
no1 in desktop mapping in fact he says there isnt even any 
competition yet 
these kinds of capabilities have been available on 
minicomputers and mainframes before but its never been made so 
that the common person can use it or its never been priced so that 
the common person can afford it said osullivan who developed 
the company with three other students of rensselaer polytechnic 
institute in 1985 
while some might view mapinfos product as competition for 
mapping via larger computers it can also complement those methods 
says thomas delaney manager in ibms geographic and mapping 
products department in kingston ny 
ibm is on mapinfos list of customers and is also a competitor 
the market is not really a market where if you do pc stuff 
youre going to influence mainframes it really all has to work 
together he said 
delaney refused to say if ibm which now is involved in mapping 
using mainframes and minicomputers is developing a program that 
would be comparable to mapinfos 
so just who uses digital maps and databases on personal 
computers 
companies or individuals use mapinfo for sales and marketing 
trend analysis demographic analysis dispatching and even planning 
of routes for optical fiber cables 
customers include police departments who want to map out crime 
scenes real estate agents city planners cemetery planners 
orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or aids 
concentrations 
even if the job is really large and theyve clients got 
their heart set on a larger system we would recommend mapinfo to 
start out with and to train their people if nothing else said 
mickey talton vice president of caps consulting which works with 
the growing market of geographical information systems 
based in tuscaloosa ala caps consulting deals primarily with 
urban planning departments and recommends mapinfo frequently 
because of its quality speed with large databases ease of use and 
price he said 
smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford to 
have this in their offices he said 
osullivan said sales went from zero to millions within one 
year but he refuses to disclose figures 
their customers which are located in 18 countries include the 
us postal service united parcel service the us geological 
survey american telephone amp telegraph co chrysler corp general 
motors corp chemical bank and mcdonalds corp 
this spring mapinfo won a 250000 contract with the us army 
to provide mapping software to its recruiting command 
the system will be used for sales and marketing applications to 
help the army better allocate recruiting personnel 
theres a potential for mapinfo to be a 50 million to a 
100 million dollar company down the road osullivan said 
mapinfo came to be when osullivan completed the design of an 
electronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of a 
college project by the time sullivan graduated in 1985 he and 
three other engineers and programmers had joined with business 
consultant michael marvin and obtained financial backing to launch 
the firm 
the first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987 the 
current version in january 1988 
the software package costs 750 and digital maps for 300 
metropolitan areas in the united states range in price up to 2000 
the programs provide names of streets rivers and bridges as 
well as address number ranges for every block and side of a street 
buyers can also use the software with their own maps 
because the firm has met with success so far and has been 
written about in technical magazines the threat of competition 
always looms 
we always feel like were running against ghosts said 
marvin who is mapinfos chief executive officer 
an offshoot of the firm called map media international was 
launched this spring which uses the mapinfo software and adapts it 
to the markets for newspaper and television 
and at mapinfo the development staff is always working on the 
next version of the mapping system 
this company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10 
software companies in the united states because the market is just 
exploding at this point in time osullivan contended

breaking up may be hard to do but its a great 
way to get the attention of the people who matter most bruce 
bickner might say 
bickner is neither a lonely hearts columnist nor a pop 
psychologist offering advice to the lovelorn he is president of 
dekalb corp an illinois conglomerate that is about to break up 
into three possibly four publicly traded companies 
the scheduled aug 31 split will allow each of dekalbs lines of 
business oil and gas exploration agricultural genetics oilwell 
servicing and irrigationequipment manufacturing to stand alone 
investors have been gobbling up dekalbs stock in anticipation 
of the restructuring in the 10 months since the company announced 
the plan its stock price has soared from about 20 to near 32 
but behind the rising value of dekalbs stock are the buy 
recommendations of research analysts who largely had ignored the 
company until its breakup plans became apparent 
dekalb had net income of 429 million on revenues of 367 
million last year compared with a 1986 loss of 507 million on 
revenues of 4067 million but despite the companys greatly 
improved performance since 1986 dekalb found few analysts willing 
to follow a firm with such disparate interests 
the large investment houses just dont seem to cooperate 
across industry lines bickner said in a recent interview in 
chicago dekalb is based in the northern illinois city of dekalb 
somebody who covers the food industry and would by nature 
understand dekalbs agricultural business would be reluctant to 
cover dekalb because they dont know what to do with the oil 
business he said if theyre writing a report on dekalb and 
most of dekalbs assets are in oil and gas reserves what are they 
going to say about the stock 
several analysts now following the company agreed that dekalbs 
diversification regarded as a plus in the 1960s and 1970s worked 
against its stock value in the past two years even though the 
50yearold firm clearly was recovering from its weak period of the 
early 1980s 
im an oil analyst said charles m strain of houstonbased 
lovett mitchell webb amp garrison and its hard enough for me to 
follow 20 or 30 oil companies without following one thats at least 
as subject to the vagaries of the hybrid corn seed business as it 
is to the vagaries of the oil business 
i get very uncomfortable with my knowledge of the seed 
business he added 
research analysts prefer simplicity said michael j harris an 
energy analyst with morgan keegan amp co of memphis who began 
recommending dekalbs stock last year 
logical diversification makes some kind of sense he said 
but when youre in the agriculture business and you also own gas 
and oil the ag analysts dont understand oil and gas and the oil 
analysts dont understand agriculture 
dekalbs restructuring plan calls for distributing a half share 
of stock in the agricultural company to be called dekalb genetics 
corp and one share of stock in pride petroleum services inc the 
oilwell servicing company for each share of dekalb corp stock 
dekalb corp then will be renamed dekalb energy co and will 
concentrate on oil and gas exploration 
finally the company plans an initial public offering of the 
lindsay manufacturing co its wholly owned irrigation 
manufacturing and marketing division john stafford dekalbs chief 
financial officer said the lindsay offering is tentatively planned 
for september but the date will depend on market conditions and 
the timing of regulatory approval 
dekalb currently has two types of stock class a voting stock 
which is not publicly traded and class b nonvoting stock which 
is publicly traded the roberts family which founded dekalb in the 
1930s controls 60 percent of the class a stock and thus controls 
the company 
after the split the roberts family will retain control of 
dekalb energy and dekalb genetics but pride petroleum will have 
only one class of stock all voting only 20 percent of that stock 
will be owned by the roberts family 
the family is retaining its absolute control of the genetics 
and energy business but giving up absolute control of pride 
bickner said 
analysts have estimated the aggregate value of the companies 
after the spinoff at 34 to 40 a share dekalb energy is expected 
to trade around 20 a share dekalb genetics at about 10 and 
dekalb corp at around 7 
in addition to demonstrating the importance of analyst coverage 
to a stocks value dekalbs breakup illustrates the declining 
popularity among investors of conglomerates in favor of socalled 
pure plays companies with only one line of business 
i think the last time it was an advantage to be a conglomerate 
was in the late 60s in the late 60s they were magic said 
strain 
analyst harris agreed 
twenty years ago there was a mindset among corporate 
executives that they were going to be portfolio managers they 
would buy and sell companies and get big and diversify and that was 
good he said 
but in the last few years its finally dawned on people that 
managers should not be portfolio managers harris added they 
should run businesses and let the investors arrange their own 
portfolios

politicians and olympic sponsors usually try for 
the limelight with advertising every four years but their efforts 
this year have failed to make ad company stocks stars on wall 
street 
industry analysts estimate that the major advertising stocks as 
a group have underperformed the broader market by about 10 percent 
this year 
they say the outlook for the group remains tied closely to the 
performance of the economy next year 
the industry has gone through three tough years said alan 
gottesman who follows the ad business for the investment firm 
painewebber 
but he said the rigors of industry consolidation and 
costcutting may have put the group in a position to benefit from 
whatever surprises may lie ahead 
over the past two years consolidation created some huge ad 
holding companies omnicom group inc wpp group plc and a bigger 
saatchi amp saatchi plc the publiclyheld ad companies also include 
interpublic group of companies inc ogilvy group and foote cone amp 
belding communications inc 
simultaneously agencies were laying off workers and taking 
other costcutting steps gottesman estimates ad industry 
employment is down 3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago 
the belttightening came in time for the industry to reap 
earnings benefits from ad spending growth expected due to the 
elections and the olympic games 
but the anticipated spurt has largely failed to materialize 
in june the industry guru robert j coen of the ad agency 
mccannerickson scaled back his estimate of us ad spending growth 
for the year to 84 percent down from the 9 percent gain he had 
forecast six months earlier 
some other ad industry analysts expect even slower growth 
james dougherty who follows advertising stocks for county 
securities said the quadrennial year is turning out to be a big 
zero he expects an increase excluding direct mail spending of 5 
percent to 6 percent this year 
dougherty said the economy is at a different stage in the 
business cycle than it was when ad spending climbed at doubledigit 
rates in 1976 and 1984 
the economic news this year hasnt been bad but it hasnt 
been as good as it was in those years at the beginning of a big 
expansion he said 
charles crane who follows the ad business for prudentialbache 
securities said us ad spending should rise about 7 percent this 
year 
he said spending didnt get its normal quadrennial lift because 
consumer spending increases have been anemic that hurt ad stocks 
he said because the market has been shying away from consumer 
cyclical stocks this year 
looking ahead coen expects ad spending will grow 75 percent in 
1989 while dougherty and crane expect growth roughly matching this 
years pace 
dougherty noted that commercial time is sold out on the summer 
olympics broadcasts and that advance sales of time on the three 
major television networks for the fall exceeded last years strong 
totals 
but even so he said i dont have anybody telling me clients 
are increasing their budgets 
crane said a pickup may occur in consumer spending as the trauma 
of last falls stock market crash recedes and said that would make 
the case for 1989 not being a bad year at all 
as a result he finds the ad stocks attractive with the caveat 
that i dont expect a recession before 1990 
in their search for new ways to generate revenue some of the 
major ad agencies have been buying marketing services firms that 
offer the consulting promotion and design work that ad companies 
once spurned 
dougherty said the results from this shopping spree have been 
mixed 
crane said a gradual movement by major advertisers away from the 
flatfee system of compensating ad agencies could be a boon to 
wellmanaged agencies 
under some new methods agencies are taking lower base rates but 
get incentive payments if their advertising works boosting sales 
or market share 
gottesman said the recent pace of new product introductions 
indicates that consumer products companies are taking risks and 
becoming more agressive that could be a plus for ad companies 
because new product rollouts usually mean more advertising 
he is not pushing the group but feels good about it 
if there are no surprises the ad stocks go sideways 
gottesman said but if we see some surprises the surprises will 
likely be on the good side and the stocks are going to go up
